5|$|Oxford Castle is a large, partly ruined Norman medieval castle on {{the western}} side of central Oxford in Oxfordshire, England. Most of the {{original}} moated, wooden motte and bailey castle was replaced in stone in the 11th century and {{played an important role in}} the conflict of the Anarchy. In the 14th century the military value of the castle diminished and the site became used primarily for <b>county</b> <b>administration</b> and as a prison.|$|E
5|$|The emperor had the {{exclusive}} right {{to modify the}} law code and issue new laws {{in the form of}} imperial edicts (zhao 詔) and decrees (ling 令). However, he often accepted the decisions and reforms suggested by his chief judicial minister, the Commandant of Justice. The emperor also acted as the supreme judge. Any lawsuits which a <b>county</b> <b>administration,</b> then commandery administration, and then Minister of Justice could not resolve were deferred to the emperor.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s {{there was}} {{increasing}} pressure {{to reform the}} structure of English counties {{and the question of}} county government had become a major political issue. Both the Liberal and Conservative party manifestos for the 1886 general election contained promises to introduce elected local authorities. The Local Government (Boundaries) Act 1887 received Royal Assent in September 1887 and appointed Boundary Commissioners to review the existing county boundaries, except for the 'Counties Corporate'. Worcestershire would have witnessed the formation of a <b>county</b> <b>administration</b> and a loss of territory to Birmingham. The Act also legislated for Dudley to unite {{with the rest of the}} county, although this would be achieved through a transfer of territory from Staffordshire. This Act was repealed in favour of the alternative Local Government Act 1888.|$|E
40|$|Unauthorized {{changes in}} listed {{buildings}} and environments occur all around Sweden. The {{main purpose of}} this thesis is to examine how these forms of transgressions have been and are being handled in some Swedish <b>county</b> <b>administrations.</b> What do legislation within conservation of heritage expresses when transgressions occur? How do <b>county</b> <b>administrations</b> interpret and apply legislation to actual situations? What methods do <b>county</b> <b>administrations</b> make use of to prevent unauthorized changes? 16 out of Sweden´s 21 <b>county</b> <b>administrations</b> have been studied and used as an empirical basis. This basis {{has led to a}} general conclusion of the <b>county</b> <b>administrations</b> experiences and working processes when handling unauthorized changes in listed buildings. How the <b>county</b> <b>administrations</b> respond and react to these changes varies depending of personal interpretation as well as the purpose of the listing and the transgression made. The dialog and communication between counties, owners, managers and users of listed properties are therefore a necessity in the preservation of the values they are considered to represent...|$|R

5|$|Several {{government}} buildings in Alamogordo were {{constructed by the}} Works Progress Administration, a government program created in 1935 {{in response to the}} Great Depression. These include the Otero <b>County</b> <b>Administration</b> Building at 1101 New York Avenue, a Pueblo style building originally constructed as the main U.S. Post Office in 1938. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The main entrance portico features frescoes by Peter Hurd completed in 1942. The Post Office moved out in 1961, and the building was used by a succession of Federal agencies and was known as the Federal Building. The last Federal agency to occupy it was the United States Forest Service who used it as the headquarters of the Lincoln National Forest until October 2008, when that agency moved to a newly constructed building.|$|E
5|$|The county number, {{extent and}} {{authority}} have varied significantly, reflecting: {{changes in the}} monarchial and noble relative influences; Ottoman conquest and Croatian recapture of various territories; and societal and political changes through several centuries. In the 13th and 14th century, the Croatian nobility grew stronger and the counties defined by the king were reduced to a legislative framework, while military and financial power was concentrated in the feudal lords. Other forms of administration that overlapped with <b>county</b> <b>administration</b> in this period included the Roman Catholic Church and the free royal cities, and separately the cities of Dalmatia. After Croatia became a crown land of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1527, the importance of counties faded even further, but was gradually restored after 1760.|$|E
5|$|The {{courthouse}} {{was used}} as the primary seat of government for Hudson County from its opening on September 20, 1910 until the construction of the Hudson <b>County</b> <b>Administration</b> Building in 1966. The courthouse was vacant for many years and was scheduled for demolition. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 25, 1970. Restoration began in the mid-1970s, and the building was reopened in 1985. In 1984, the Hudson County Board of Chosen Freeholders renamed the building in honor of Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. The restoration of the courthouse was acknowledged by a Victorian Society in America Preservation Award in 1988.|$|E

5|$|York Castle {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} by the 15th and 16th centuries, becoming used increasingly as a jail for both local felons and political prisoners. By {{the time of}} Elizabeth I the castle was estimated to have lost all of its military value but was maintained as a centre of royal authority in York. The outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 saw York Castle being repaired and refortified, playing {{a part in the}} Royalist defence of York in 1644 against Parliamentary forces. York Castle continued to be garrisoned until 1684, when an explosion destroyed the interior of Clifford's Tower. The castle bailey was redeveloped in a neoclassical style in the 18th century as a centre for <b>county</b> <b>administration</b> in Yorkshire, and was used as a jail and debtors' prison. Prison reform in the 19th century {{led to the creation of}} a new prison built in a Tudor Gothic style on the castle site in 1825; used first as a county and then as a military prison, this facility was demolished in 1935. By the 20th century the ruin of Clifford's Tower had become a well-known tourist destination and national monument; today the site is owned by English Heritage and open to the public. The other remaining buildings serve as the York Castle Museum and the Crown Court.|$|E

25|$|Croydon's {{growth in}} the 19th century brought the issue of {{incorporation}} back on to the political agenda, and in 1883 the ancient parish of Croydon, apart from its exclave of Croydon Crook or Selsdon, was created a municipal borough within Surrey. In 1889, because the population was high enough, it was made a county borough, exempt from <b>county</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|E

25|$|There were {{hundreds}} of people gathered at the California State Capitol in Sacramento. The rally was peaceful, {{even though there were}} counter-protesters. Police estimated that there were around 2,000 protesters at the San Diego march, which was held outside the San Diego <b>County</b> <b>Administration</b> Center at Waterfront Park and also attracted a smaller group of Trump supporters. Lori Saldaña spoke at the event, as did representatives from Border Angels and the San Diego Young Muslim Democrats. The march was also in protest of Doug Manchester, who was Trump's nominee to be United States Ambassador to the Bahamas. There was a counter-protest with around 150 people wearing helmets and riot gear; police officers worked to keep the two groups separated.|$|E

25|$|Östersund {{continued}} to grow and in 1970 Frösö köping was made part of Östersund. In the year of 1971 a major reform occurred in Sweden creating large municipalities replacing all the older institutions and the new large municipality was named after the city. Just like {{in the rest of}} Sweden the public sector greatly expanded at this time. In 1960 the public sector of Sweden constituted about 30 per cent of Sweden's total gross domestic product, {{in the middle of the}} 1980s the number had grown to 65 per cent. At the time it was here the jobs were, in the county board, the state and in the new municipality. The main reason for the large expansion were the expanded transfer payment to the households that occurred, along with growing interest and public consummation. Everything was founded by large tax raises. The entire 1970s was an expansive period. Besides the new industrial complex the Frösö bridge was constructed, a new police house, Z-kupolen (burned to the ground in 1989), Storsjöteatern, Folkets hus, urban district churches, malls etc. The <b>County</b> <b>Administration</b> board and the hospital expanded and large housing estates were constructed in Körfältet, Lugnvik and Odensala.|$|E
25|$|During the interwar, Lithuania regained independence. The {{first law}} on {{administrative}} sub-units was passed on July 1, 1919. It declared that Lithuania {{was divided into}} twenty counties (Lithuanian: singular – apskritis, plural – apskritys). Several more counties (including Zarasai, Naujieji Švenčionys, Vilnius, Eišiškės, Lida, Ashmyany and Hrodna) were reserved for territories in the Vilnius Region, that Lithuania had claims to, but were under Polish or Russian control. Later on Suwałki county was lost to Poland, but Zarasai (also known as Ežerėnai) county was acquired. Two of the designated counties, Trakai and Sejny, had their proclaimed capitals outside the de facto borders of Lithuania and had their temporary capitals established at Kaišiadorys and Lazdijai. After the Klaipėda Region was acquired in 1923, it was divided into three counties (Klaipėda, Šilutė and Pagėgiai). That way the number of counties increased to twenty three and remained stable until 1939. According to a law passed in 1931 eleven first-class cities became independent of <b>county</b> <b>administration</b> and had their own government. In March 1939, after an ultimatum from Hitler, Lithuania lost the Klaipėda Region with its three counties. In October Soviet Union returned one fifth of the Vilnius Region in exchange for Red Army stations in Lithuania. Acquired Vilnius Region was divided into three counties (Vilnius, Eišiškės, and Naujieji Švenčionys). Therefore, {{at the end of}} 1939 Lithuania again had twenty three counties. Counties were further subdivided into townships (Lithuanian: singular – valsčius, plural – valsčiai). In 1933 there were 365 townships. The townships were further subdivided into elderates (Lithuanian: seniūnija).|$|E
25|$|WFAA was {{the first}} station {{to break the news}} of President John F. Kennedy's {{assassination}} on November 22, 1963, which occurred about two blocks north of the station's studios near Dealey Plaza, outside the Texas School Book Depository (now known as the Dallas <b>County</b> <b>Administration</b> Building), and seriously injured then-Governor John Connally, who was riding in the motorcade carrying Kennedy. The station conducted the first live television interview with Abraham Zapruder, who shot the famous film of the assassination. During the course of the interview with Zapruder, who came to the Communications Center studio by police escort, WFAA announcer and program director, Jay Watson (who reported on the shooting with Jerry Haynes, both of whom heard the gunshots being fired at Kennedy), intimated that the film was to be developed in the station's film lab; however, WFAA did not possess the ability to process the Kodachrome II 8mm safety film from Zapruder's camera. WFAA and its live remote unit fed much of the coverage of the assassination and its aftermath to ABC over the next four days. The shooting of accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby in the basement of Dallas police headquarters, however, was not broadcast live (as it was on NBC) or on tape (as on CBS one minute later) by WFAA and ABC as the former's live newsgathering truck was positioned elsewhere at the time. ABC was therefore only able to show delayed newsreel footage of the historic event. WFAA had purchased a fully equipped, live broadcast studio truck prior to the assassination of Kennedy, but the truck was not rolled out for the parade through downtown Dallas. In the aftermath of the murder, the staff was told the cost would have been too great for the news department to compensate the production facility for its use.|$|E
