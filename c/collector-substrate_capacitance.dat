40|$|Bipolar Transistors (HBTs) in a CMOS platform. This {{technology}} is at present contender for demanding high speed applications like 60 GHz ultra-wide band communication and 77 GHz car radar. For applications beyond these operating frequencies, the so-called terahertz or submillimeter frequency range, roughly defined as extending from 200 GHz to 30 THz, SiGe:C HBTs might play a rolewith devices having fT and fmax higher than 500 GHz. This PhD {{work is a}} feasibility study on how to realize such performance through vertical profile engineering, lateral architecture exploration and lateral scaling. Based {{on the concept of}} regional transit time analysis, the vertical profile is engineered with respect to different regions to reduce the transit time and improve the RF performances. Different architectures have been studied. The conventional quasi-self aligned (QSA) architecture has demonstrated its possibility of pushing fmax up to 300 GHz through optimization of the external poly base. Three self-aligned architectures have been studied based on TCAD. It has been demonstrated that with aggressive lateral scaling, these architectures could reach an fmax of 500 GHz. For the conventionalself-aligned HBT, this could only be reached by decreasing the resistivity of the external base layer. As practical realizations of these self-aligned architectures are subject to the technological limitations in comparison with the theoretical TCAD structures, it is expected that the realized performance is a bit below the TCAD predicted performance. For a newly proposed architecture (G 1 G), the actual 460 GHz fmax performance was close to the predicted performance. For a novel device architecture with a low-parasitic collector construction, an fmax of effectively 500 GHz could be reached. This PhD also works on some limitations of the very high speed SiGe:C HBTs, for example the break-down voltage BVCEO (breakdown between collector and monocrystalline emitter close to the emitter-base junction is investigated, which shows that the SiGe spike in the monoemitter improves the breakdown voltage without sacrificing the RF performances. fT and fmax are commonly used figures-of-merit of transistors on the device level. However on the circuit level, other parasitics also need to be considered, for example the <b>collector-substrate</b> <b>capacitance.</b> This thesis investigates the impact of isolation schemes on the <b>collector-substrate</b> <b>capacitance</b> as well as the thermal resistance. nrpages: 192 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper, {{based on}} {{two-dimensional}} simulations, provides a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} electrical characteristics of the Silicon germanium (SiGe) -base bipolar transistors on thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates. The impact of the buried oxide thickness (T(OX)), the emitter width (W(E)), and the lateral distance between {{the edge of the}} intrinsic base and the reach-through region (L(col)) on both the AC and DC device characteristics was analyzed in detail. Regarding the DC characteristics, the simulation results suggest that a thicker T(OX) gives a larger base-collector breakdown voltage (BV(CEO)), whereas reducing the T(OX) leads to an enhanced maximum electric field at the B-C junction. As for the AC characteristics, cut-off frequency (f(T)) increases slightly with increasing buried oxide thickness and finally saturates to a constant value when the buried oxide thickness is about 0. 15 mu m. The <b>collector-substrate</b> <b>capacitance</b> (C(CS)) decreases with increasing buried oxide thickness while the maximum oscillation frequency (f(max)) increases with increasing buried oxide thickness. Furthermore, the impact of self-heating effects in the device was analyzed in various areas. The thermal resistance {{as a function of the}} buried oxide thickness indicates that the thermal resistance of the SiGe-base bipolar transistor on a SOI substrate is slightly higher than that of a bulk SiGe-base bipolar transistor. The thermal resistance is reduced by similar to 37. 89 % when the emitter width is increased by a factor of 5 for a fixed buried oxide thickness of 0. 1 mu m. All the results can be used to design and optimize SiGe-base bipolar transistors on SOI substrates with minimum thermal resistance to enhance device performance...|$|E
