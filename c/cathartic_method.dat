50|$|Experts now {{refer to}} Janet’s {{approach}} as the <b>cathartic</b> <b>method.</b> In A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis, Charles Rycroft said that abreaction was the term {{applied to the}} expression of affect, with the subsequent alleviation of symptoms being the catharsis.|$|E
5000|$|Abreaction: concept {{introduced}} by Sigmund Freud in 1893 to denote {{the fact that}} pent-up emotions associated with a trauma can be discharged by talking about it. The release of affect occurred by bringing [...] "a particular moment or problem into focus"... and as such formed the cornerstone of Freud's early <b>cathartic</b> <b>method</b> of treating hysterical conversion symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|Josef Breuer ( [...] ; 15 January 1842 - 20 June 1925) was a {{distinguished}} Austrian physician who made key discoveries in neurophysiology, and whose {{work in the}} 1880s with his patient Bertha Pappenheim, known as Anna O., developed the talking cure (<b>cathartic</b> <b>method)</b> and laid the foundation to psychoanalysis as developed by his protégé Sigmund Freud.|$|E
5000|$|Osho {{believed}} that <b>cathartic</b> <b>methods</b> were necessary, {{since it was}} difficult for modern people to just sit and enter meditation; [...] "I never tell people to begin with just sitting. With a mad dance, you begin to be aware of a silent point within you; with sitting silently, you begin to be aware of madness." [...] His [...] "dialectical" [...] methods alternate activity and passivity, adapting elements of mantra and pranayama, latihan, kirtan and psychotherapeutic catharsis.|$|R
2500|$|Rajneesh {{developed}} other active meditation techniques, {{such as the}} Kundalini [...] "shaking" [...] {{meditation and}} the Nadabrahma [...] "humming" [...] meditation, which are less animated, although they also include physical activity {{of one sort or}} another. His later [...] "meditative therapies" [...] require sessions for several days, OSHO Mystic Rose comprising three hours of laughing every day for a week, three hours of weeping each day for a second week, and a third week with three hours of silent meditation. These processes of [...] "witnessing" [...] enable a [...] "jump into awareness". Rajneesh believed such <b>cathartic</b> <b>methods</b> were necessary, since it was difficult for modern people to just sit and enter meditation. Once the methods had provided a glimpse of meditation people would be able to use other methods without difficulty.|$|R
5000|$|Psychoanalytic {{conceptions of}} {{language}} {{refers to the}} intersection of psychoanalytic theory with linguistics and psycholinguistics. Language has been an integral component of the psychoanalytic framework since its inception, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that Anna O. (pseud. for Bertha Pappenheim), whose treatment via the <b>cathartic</b> <b>method</b> influenced the later development of psychoanalytic therapy, referred to her method of treatment as the [...] "talking cure" [...] (Freud & Breuer, 1895; de Mijolla, 2005).|$|E
50|$|In psychology, {{the term}} was first {{employed}} by Sigmund Freud's colleague Josef Breuer (1842-1925), who developed a <b>cathartic</b> <b>method</b> of treatment using hypnosis for persons suffering from intensive hysteria. While under hypnosis, Breuer's patients were able to recall traumatic experiences, and {{through the process of}} expressing the original emotions that had been repressed and forgotten, they were relieved of their hysteric symptoms. Catharsis was also central to Freud's concept of psychoanalysis, but he replaced hypnosis with free association.|$|E
5000|$|Borch-Jacobsen then reaffirmed that Sigmund Freud, {{after having}} started to use suggestive {{hypnotic}} psychotherapy on Hippolyte Bernheim in 1887 {{replaced it with}} the <b>cathartic</b> <b>method</b> in 1899, no longer using hypnosis {{as a means of}} direct suggestion, but to bring out suppressed feelings of patients' traumas. After practicing using free association in 1892, Freud totally abandoned hypnosis at the end of 1896. This is explained in the following manner by Chertok: [...] "" [...] ("In his opposition to hypnosis, Freud was known to have founded a scientific psychotherapy, destined, as such, to become the psychotherapy par excellence. The interpretation and the capture of consciousness thus becomes the fulcrum of the cure. The effectiveness of the new method certainly could not be discounted, but in it one can find it being channelled into transference, and by that, come to dominate the consciousness and put it to work. Such was the ambition of the Founder of Psychoanalysis Freud, and {{the turn of the century}} was once again filled with positivity"). It is precisely this posture of Freud's that the consciousness is [...] "dominated" [...] that was put into question by Borch-Jacobsen.|$|E
40|$|The case of Fräulein Anna O (Bertha Pappenheim) was {{the first}} {{detailed}} by Breuer and Freud in 'Studien über Hysteria' (1895). The case history is examined and an organic causation postulated. The fallacies of psychogenesis and of hysteria as a disease are mentioned. Breuer's claim of cure by the <b>cathartic</b> <b>method</b> appears unfounded...|$|E
40|$|A {{clinical}} case of Louis Vivet, {{described by}} Bourru and Burot (1888), contributed to elaborate {{the concepts of}} multiple personality and <b>cathartic</b> <b>method.</b> The authors present this clinical case, the cultural context of this mental illness, and the relevant theories. The genetic analysis of Louis Vivet's iatrogenic disorder or transient mental illness (Hacking, 2002) shows how the dominant theories on identity and memory contributed to construct the symptoms observed by Bourru and Burot (1888) and validated the therapeutic methods...|$|E
40|$|Freud's use of hypnosis, {{within the}} frame of the <b>cathartic</b> <b>method,</b> leads him unwittingly to suggest {{memories}} consistent with his beliefs. He accordingly holds to the, then forsakes it when he realizes that his patients memories are mostly confabulated. He refuses to acknowledge the influence he exerted, and elaborates an explanation of his patients behavior which will become the psychoanalytic theory. One can wonder whether in so doing he did not lead psychotherapy into a more authoritarian direction than that of the hypnosis from which he departed.
