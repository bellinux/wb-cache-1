40|$|Cbl-associated protein (<b>CAP)</b> is an adaptor {{protein that}} plays {{important}} roles in both signal transduction and cytoskeleton rearrangement. Alternative splicing of the gene SORBS 1 results in multiple isoforms of <b>CAP</b> protein. We report here the cloning of 3 new <b>CAP</b> isoforms, <b>CAP</b> 2, <b>CAP</b> 3, and <b>CAP</b> 4, from mouse adipose tissue. RT-PCR analyses reveal that the isoform mRNAs are differentially expressed. <b>CAP</b> 2, <b>CAP</b> 3, and <b>CAP</b> 4 contain a coiled-coil domain. In addition, <b>CAP</b> 4 contains a proline-rich region, part of which exists in <b>CAP</b> 3. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments show that <b>CAP</b> 4 forms a homodimeric complex. While these new isoforms similarly interact with Cbl, they exhibit varied binding specificity toward vinculin. In contrast to <b>CAP</b> 1 and <b>CAP</b> 2, <b>CAP</b> 4 does not interact with vinculin, and <b>CAP</b> 3 binds with low affinity. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrates differential subcellular localization of Myc-tagged <b>CAP</b> isoforms in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. These results suggest that these new isoforms of <b>CAP</b> might play different signaling roles...|$|R

25|$|<b>Cap</b> {{structure}} is sometimes expressed as initial adjustment <b>cap</b> / subsequent adjustment <b>cap</b> / life <b>cap,</b> for example 2/2/5 {{for a loan}} with a 2% <b>cap</b> on the initial adjustment, a 2% <b>cap</b> on subsequent adjustments, and a 5% <b>cap</b> on total interest rate adjustments. When only two values are given, this indicates that the initial change <b>cap</b> and periodic <b>cap</b> are the same.

50|$|Year-over-base <b>caps</b> {{allow the}} <b>cap</b> to raise {{each year by}} a certain, {{predetermined}} percentage of a pre-determined, initial (base) CAM charge. Year-over-year <b>caps</b> mean the percentage increase applies not to a base amount, but to the actual CAM charge of the previous year. Cumulative <b>caps</b> allow the yearly percentage increase of the CAM <b>Cap</b> to accumulate. Thus, a yearly 5% <b>cap</b> would grow the <b>cap</b> each year by 5%, so that the first year it was a 5% <b>cap,</b> the 2nd year a 10% <b>cap,</b> the third year 15, and so on.
