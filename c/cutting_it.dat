5|$|Australia {{picked a}} {{preliminary}} squad of 30 players, before <b>cutting</b> <b>it</b> down to 14 on 4 September. Stuart Clark suffered a thigh injury {{and missed the}} tournament. Dan Cullen was called up as a replacement on 5 October.|$|E
5|$|Improvements in {{relations}} continued during the year, with two summit meetings, {{the first in}} Moscow and the second on Governor’s Island in New York. An earthquake struck Armenia during the second summit, <b>cutting</b> <b>it</b> short. However, a U.S. offer of assistance to the victims was accepted by Gorbachev, {{and became the first}} official assistance by the U.S. since World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} of Spooks was {{nominated}} for six awards, one of which it won. It {{was nominated for}} three British Academy Television Awards (BAFTA) awards, two of which were Craft nominations. The series won the Best Drama Series category over Clocking Off, <b>Cutting</b> <b>It</b> and Teachers.|$|E
50|$|It was {{at first}} only a {{temporary}} building in the <b>cutting.</b> <b>Its</b> first station master was a Mr. Portlock.|$|R
50|$|Parthenocissus dalzielli {{can grow}} in pots or on slopes. It is {{propagated}} from seeds or <b>cuttings.</b> <b>It</b> needs lots {{of light and}} humid weather.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} not well known in cultivation. It can be grown from seed or <b>cuttings.</b> <b>It</b> {{requires}} a semi-shaded position, well drained soil and adequate watering.|$|R
5|$|Drug {{collectors}} {{have certain}} traditions {{which may be}} accurate or may be exaggerated. Precautions are rightly taken when gathering hellebore, and men cannot dig it up for long; whereas the story that the peony must be dug up at night for fear that a woodpecker will watch and cause the man a rectal prolapse is a mere superstition. Similarly {{the idea that you}} must mark three circles around a mandrake plant with a sword, and speak of the mysteries of love while <b>cutting</b> <b>it,</b> is just far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|According to {{generally}} accepted standards of respect, the national flag {{should never be}} dipped to any person or thing. Care {{should be taken to}} prevent the flag from touching the ground, floor or water beneath it. It should be also secured from being torn off or falling to the ground and it should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain, blizzard or very strong wind. The flag should never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by <b>cutting</b> <b>it</b> in half so as to separate the colors and then, burning.|$|E
5|$|Also {{found on}} {{calcareous}} (chalky) soils, Rubroboletus satanas is larger {{and has a}} pale cap, and its upper stem lacks the reticulations characteristic of S.luridus. Its flesh does not turn blue so markedly on bruising or <b>cutting.</b> <b>It</b> has a more globular overall shape, and young mushrooms carry a smell of decay. The edible Neoboletus luridiformis can be distinguished from S.luridus by its dark brown cap; it also grows on sandy soils associated with conifers. In North America, it can {{be confused with the}} poisonous Rubroboletus pulcherrimus, which has a fatter stalk and deeper red pores. Initially collected in Michigan under oak, Boletus vinaceobasis resembles S.luridus but has shorter spores and its cystidia are dark brown in Melzer's reagent. Boletus species that share a similar appearance with S.luridus but lack reticulation in their stems include B.subvelutipes (found in North America and Asia) and B.hypocarycinus (United States).|$|E
50|$|Slender myoporum is a hardy {{plant in}} well-drained soil {{in full sun}} and is most easily {{propagated}} from <b>cuttings.</b> <b>It</b> grows well in Portugal and is naturalised there.|$|R
50|$|B. glabra is {{heat and}} drought {{tolerant}} and frost sensitive. It is easily propagated by <b>cuttings.</b> <b>It</b> needs full sunlight, warm weather and well drained soil to flower well.|$|R
25|$|MCC missed chances innumerable, and, {{looking back}} over one's <b>cuttings,</b> <b>it</b> comes as a {{surprise}} to read how poor the English fielding, and especially the catching, was on this tour.|$|R
5|$|Generally, {{ships are}} removed from the fleet by going through {{a process known as}} ship {{breaking}} or scrapping. Ship-owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship's empty weight (called light ton displacement or LDT) and prices in the scrap metal market. In 1998, almost 700ships were scrapped in places like Alang, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh. This is often done by 'beaching' the ship on open sand, then <b>cutting</b> <b>it</b> apart by hand with gas torches, a dangerous operation that results in injuries and fatalities, as well as exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, and various chemicals. Half a million deadweight tons worth of bulk carriers were scrapped in 2004, accounting for 4.7% of the year's scrapping. That year, bulkers fetched particularly high scrap prices, between $340 and $350 per LDT.|$|E
5|$|Within the Celtic spiritual sphere {{there is}} {{considerable}} variation. The 4th and early 3rd century BC burials in Wrocław and Ślęża region are skeletal. Sometimes {{a man and a}} woman were buried together, suggesting the known Celtic practice of killing the wife during her husband's funeral, but women were usually buried separately, with their jewelry. Some of the dead were given meat and a knife for <b>cutting</b> <b>it.</b> From the 3rd century on the bodies were cremated, which was also the case in all of the Lesser Poland burials. There in Iwanowice the graves of Celtic warriors (3rd century BC) contain a very rich assortment of weapons and decorations.|$|E
5|$|Washington and {{the other}} ships of TF39 participated in {{exercises}} with the Home Fleet until late April. Along with certain British units, the task force departed the British Isles as TF99. They escorted some of the Arctic convoys which were carrying vital cargo to the Soviet Union. While carrying out this duty, an accompanying British battleship, , accidentally rammed a destroyer, <b>cutting</b> <b>it</b> in two. Directly behind King George V, Washington passed through the same stretch of sea and received damage from exploding depth charges. Though damage to the hull was minimal—limited to only one leaking fuel tank—many devices on board the ship were damaged, including main battery range finders, circuit breakers, three fire-control and the search radars. The American ships then put in at an Icelandic port, Hvalfjörður, until 15 May; they returned to Scapa Flow on 3 June. On 4 June, Washington hosted the commander of naval forces in Europe, Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark, who set up a temporary headquarters on the ship {{for the next few}} days. On 7 June, King George VI of the United Kingdom inspected the battleship.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} {{sometimes}} seen in cultivation, but has proven difficult to propagate from either seed or <b>cuttings.</b> <b>It</b> makes an attractive rockery plant, its bright green foliage and yellow flowers are features.|$|R
50|$|Parthenocissus henryana {{can grow}} on walls and trellising, in large pots, {{and as a}} groundcover on slopes. It is {{propagated}} from seeds or <b>cuttings.</b> <b>It</b> has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|R
50|$|Myoporum insulare {{may be used}} as {{a fast-growing}} hedge or {{windbreak}} species which withstands coastal winds and drought. It is hardy in well drained positions and is easily propagated from <b>cuttings.</b> <b>It</b> is also used as rootstock for propagating many Eremophila species.|$|R
5|$|On lap 13, Felipe Massa passed Marcus Ericsson for ninth {{place and}} one lap later, Hamilton capitalised on a mistake by Vettel and overtook him to retake second {{position}}. Vettel lost another position when he let Räikkönen pass him on lap 16, the two being on different strategies. Meanwhile, Rosberg {{had built up}} a lead of around six seconds to Hamilton. On lap 19, Carlos Sainz Jr. allowed teammate Max Verstappen to pass him, while Alonso came in for what was his third pit stop of the race, leaving him in last position. Two laps later, Verstappen created flatspots on his tyres when he locked up his brakes, forcing him to pit. He emerged in 15th position. Vettel came in for his first pit stop on lap 24, coming out in sixth place ahead of compatriot Nico Hülkenberg. At the same time, Hamilton started to reduce the gap to Rosberg in front, <b>cutting</b> <b>it</b> down to less than two seconds by lap 29. With his teammate closing in, Rosberg made pit stops on lap 32, with Räikkönen following suit, whose pit stop was delayed, losing him around four seconds. Sergio Pérez was starting {{to close the gap}} to both Ferrari drivers in front of him after pitting early. Vettel reacted on lap 41 and changed to the super-soft tyres, coming out behind both Pérez and Ricciardo in sixth. One lap later, Hamilton came in for his second and final stop, having asked his team before if {{it would be possible to}} finish the race without stopping again. He emerged twelve seconds behind Rosberg and started to cut into his advantage immediately.|$|E
25|$|Hinduism and Buddhism {{outright}} {{reject the}} procedure of female genital <b>cutting.</b> <b>It</b> is completely absent from their traditions just as FGM is completely nonexistent in Confucianist traditions.|$|E
25|$|Telford {{designed}} a cast iron bridge, the Galton Bridge, to span his <b>cutting.</b> <b>It</b> {{was cast in}} the Horseley Iron Works, as was the Engine Arm Aqueduct {{and many of the}} wide roving bridges.|$|E
50|$|The {{first and}} oldest {{organized}} garden {{club in the}} United States is the Ladies' Garden Club of Athens, Georgia. It started in 1891 with a gathering of twelve women friends who shared plants and plant <b>cuttings.</b> <b>It</b> was formally organized the following year.|$|R
50|$|Darwinia procera is reasonbly {{well-known}} in horticulture {{with its}} unusual foliage being a feature. It can be propagated from seed but {{is easier to}} raise from <b>cuttings.</b> <b>It</b> is hardy in well-drained, sandy soil in a partly-shaded situation with occasional watering in long dry spells.|$|R
50|$|Iva imbricata is an {{important}} species for dune stabilization and can easily be propagated by <b>cuttings.</b> <b>It</b> sometimes grows up to 100 cm (40 inches) tall. It produces numerous flower heads in elongated arrays, each head with 2-17 disc flowers but no ray flowers.|$|R
25|$|Standard {{treatment}} for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is <b>cutting</b> <b>it</b> open and drainage. If {{the diagnosis is}} uncertain, the wound should be aspirated with a needle, with aspiration of pus confirming the diagnosis and availing for Gram stain and bacterial culture.|$|E
25|$|When {{the border}} between Tennessee and Arkansas was {{established}} in 1795, it followed {{the middle of the}} Mississippi River. At that time, the river ran northwest of Reverie. After the avulsion of 1876, the Mississippi River ran southeast of Reverie, <b>cutting</b> <b>it</b> off from Tipton County.|$|E
25|$|Pressurized {{water is}} used in water {{blasting}} and water jet cutters. Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise <b>cutting.</b> <b>It</b> works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.|$|E
50|$|Mossy saxifrage can {{be grown}} in a rockery in {{temperate}} climates and can be propagated from seed or by <b>cuttings.</b> <b>It</b> likes gritty, well drained soil. Apparently healthy, established plants sometimes detach themselves from their roots. This tendency {{is likely to be}} caused by excessively damp conditions.|$|R
50|$|It {{is useful}} in the garden as groundcover, {{where it can be}} short-lived, but is easily {{propagated}} from <b>cuttings.</b> <b>It</b> is also the main source of thyme as an ingredient in cooking and as an herbal medicine. It is slightly spicier than oregano and sweeter than sage.|$|R
50|$|In cultivation, Rhododendron spinuliferum grows best in acidic soils of pH 4-6 with a shady aspect and {{significant}} organic {{material in the}} soil, although excess shade will result in few flowers and leggy habit. Readily propagated by seed or <b>cuttings,</b> <b>it</b> flowers in {{four to five years}} from seed.|$|R
25|$|Pressurized {{water is}} used in water {{blasting}} and water jet cutters. Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise <b>cutting.</b> <b>It</b> works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating. This is generally a very small source of water consumption relative to other uses.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} common rules {{on how to}} treat the flag respectfully. The flag must not be dirty or damaged. The flag must never touch the ground. When the flag is washed, it must be dried indoors. A {{worn-out}} flag must be disposed of by burning (though not {{with the intent to}} disgrace it), or alternatively by <b>cutting</b> <b>it</b> to pieces small enough not to be recognizable as parts of the flag. The flag must not be buried in the ground or the sea (including not throwing it into the garbage).|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen has a clean {{flame and}} {{is good for}} use on aluminium. It can be used at a higher {{pressure}} than acetylene and is therefore useful for underwater welding and <b>cutting.</b> <b>It</b> is a good type of flame to use when heating large amounts of material. The flame temperature is high, about 2,000°C for hydrogen gas in air at atmospheric pressure, and up to 2800°C when pre-mixed in a 2:1 ratio with pure oxygen (oxyhydrogen). Hydrogen is not used for welding steels and other ferrous materials, because it causes hydrogen embrittlement.|$|E
5000|$|Shapers, slotters, and planers often {{employ a}} kind of {{toolholder}} called a clapper box that swings freely on the return stroke of the ram or bed. On the next <b>cutting</b> stroke, <b>it</b> [...] "claps" [...] back into <b>cutting</b> position. <b>Its</b> movement is analogous {{to that of a}} butterfly-style check valve.|$|R
50|$|The {{pale pink}} to bright {{lipstick}} pink flowers of this eremophila {{make it an}} attractive shrub in a garden. It is easier to propagate by grafting onto Myoporum than by <b>cuttings.</b> <b>It</b> prefers a sunny position but is frost tolerant and has been grown in areas of high humidity such as Sydney.|$|R
50|$|Its {{ability to}} grow in water makes it a popular {{aquarium}} plant. It can even grow in slightly brackish conditions. Propagation is through <b>cuttings.</b> <b>It</b> grows easily in the aquarium. The color of the leaves will vary, depending {{on the amount of}} light. The leaves will turn bronze or even almost red under high light levels.|$|R
