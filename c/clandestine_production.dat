40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the breeding potential in irradiation channels of research reactors. These reactors differ considerably from commercial power reactors in characteristics, purpose and so non-proliferation aspects. Research reactors are easily accessible and allow rapid core configuration modification to achieve high neutron fluxes, because usually they are not sealed by IAEA. From the three possible proliferation path ways for research reactors: (1) diversion of fresh fuel for U 235 extraction; (2) diversion of spent fuel for plutonium extraction; (3) <b>clandestine</b> plutonium <b>production</b> via irradiation facilities, this paper addresses the last pathway. It is of particular interest because there is no way to determine exactly which kinds of experiments are taking place every moment in irradiation channels. Moreover, irradiation time can be optimized in order to breed high quality weapon grade plutonium. With regard to the safeguards measures currently adopted, IAEA concentrates its efforts on those reactors whose thermal power is greater than 25 MWth, because it was calculated that a 25 MWth LEU-fuelled reactor produces not more than one Significant Quantity of Pu (8 kg) per year in its spent fuel and a HEU-fuelled reactor of this power would require an annual reload of not more than one Significant Quantity of U 235 (25 kg). This paper investigates whether it would be possible to determine an analogous power level threshold in order to estimate the <b>clandestine</b> plutonium <b>production</b> capability of different research reactors. The Monte Carlo method was used to determine the neutron flux in the irradiation channels and to calculate the plutonium breeding potential for three different reactor types: (1) a Triga Mark II with 250 kWth, representative for a small size research reactor; (2) a Material Test Reactor (MTR) with 5 MWth, representative for a medium size research reactor; (3) a High Flux Reactor (HFR) with 45 MWth, representative for a large size research reactor. It was observed that the most important factors for plutonium breeding are the neutron flux (to which reaction rates are proportional) and the available space to place irradiation samples. The breeding capability scales fairly well with the reactor power level and from about 10 MWth onwards the proliferation concern raises with increasing power level and available sample space. JRC.

40|$|Abstract <b>Clandestine</b> drug <b>production,</b> use, and {{exploitation}} present a social issue afflicting millions across the globe. “Designer opioids, ” some {{known to the}} street as “China White ” for their alleged purity, have been unveiled in the past years; noted to possess properties that can compromise well-being in a remarkably novel way. This class of designer opioids, the 4 -phenylpiperidines, seems to be generating significant medical concerns due to its deadly clinical manifestations; which may be further complicated by the ease of access and its potent addictive properties. The potential drug adulteration with other chemical formulations further complicates the medical scenario, posing a serious challenge {{in the management of}} presumed overdoses. Furthermore, if the key clinical manifestations are overlooked due to the presence confounding signs and symptoms to medical practitioners, patient’s mortality may potentially increase even stronger. Thus, the purpose of this communication is to create awareness about these novel agents and their potentially devastating clinical complications. We strongly support the empiric treatment with naloxone per the currently established guidelines. In addition, we urge practitioners to carefully document findings relating to recovery time and historical data to aid in early detection, and precise decision-making in suspected intoxications cases...|$|R

40|$|Technology {{has been}} long {{understood}} {{to play a}} central role in limiting the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Evolving nuclear technology, increased access to information, and systematic improvements in design and manufacturing tools, however, should in time ease the proliferation challenge. Eventually, even developing countries could possess a sufficient technical ability. There is evidence that this transition has already occurred. The basic uranium-enrichment gas centrifuge, developed in the 1960 s, has technical characteristics that are within reach of nearly all states, without foreign assistance or access to export-controllable materials. The history of centrifuge development in twenty countries supports this perspective, as do previously secret studies carried out by the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom. Complicating matters, centrifuges also have properties that make the detection of a clandestine program enormously difficult. If conditions for the <b>clandestine</b> and indigenous <b>production</b> of weapons have emerged, then nonproliferation institutions focused on technology will be inadequate.

40|$|Many <b>clandestine</b> {{development}} and <b>production</b> {{activities can be}} conducted underground to evade surveillance. The {{purpose of the study}} reported here was to develop a technique to detect underground facilities by broad-area search and then to characterize the facilities by inversion of the collected data. This would enable constraints to be placed on the types of activities that would be feasible at each underground site, providing a basis the design of targeted surveillance and analysis for more complete characterization. Excavation of underground cavities causes deformation in the host material and overburden that produces displacements at the ground surface. Such displacements are often measurable by a variety of surveying or geodetic techniques. One measurement technique, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), uses data from satellite-borne (or airborne) synthetic aperture radars (SARs) and so is ideal for detecting and measuring surface displacements in denied access regions. Depending on the radar frequency and the acquisition mode and the surface conditions, displacement maps derived from SAR interferograms can provide millimeter- to centimeter-level measurement accuracy on regional and local scales at spatial resolution of {approx} 1 - 10 m. Relatively low-resolution ({approx} 20 m, say) maps covering large regions can be used for broad-area detection, while finer resolutions ({approx} 1 m) can be used to image details of displacement fields over targeted small areas. Surface displacements are generally expected to be largest during or a relatively short time after active excavation, but, depending on the material properties, measurable displacement may continue at a decreasing rate for a considerable time after completion. For a given excavated volume in a given geological setting, the amplitude of the surface displacements decreases as the depth of excavation increases, while the area of the discernable displacement pattern increases. Therefore, the ability to detect evidence for an underground facility using InSAR depends on the displacement sensitivity and spatial resolution of the interferogram, {{as well as on the}} size and depth of the facility and the time since its completion. The methodology development described in this report focuses on the exploitation of synthetic aperture radar data that are available commercially from a number of satellite missions. Development of the method involves three components: (1) Evaluation of the capability of InSAR to detect and characterize underground facilities; (2) inversion of InSAR data to infer the location, depth, shape and volume of a subsurface facility; and (3) evaluation and selection of suitable geomechanical forward models to use in the inversion. We adapted LLNL's general-purpose Bayesian Markov Chain-Monte Carlo procedure, the 'Stochastic Engine' (SE), to carry out inversions to characterize subsurface void geometries. The SE performs forward simulations for a large number of trial source models to identify the set of models that are consistent with the observations and prior constraints. The inverse solution produced by this kind of stochastic method is a posterior probability density function (pdf) over alternative models, which forms an appropriate input to risk-based decision analyses to evaluate subsequent response strategies. One major advantage of a stochastic inversion approach is its ability to deal with complex, non-linear forward models employing empirical, analytical or numerical methods. However, while a geomechanical model must incorporate adequate physics to enable sufficiently accurate prediction of surface displacements, it must also be computationally fast enough to render the large number of forward realizations needed in stochastic inversion feasible. This latter requirement prompted us first to investigate computationally efficient empirical relations and closed-form analytical solutions. However, our evaluation revealed severe limitations in the ability of existing empirical and analytical forms to predict deformations from underground cavities with an accuracy consistent with the potential resolution and precision of InSAR data. We followed two approaches to overcoming these limitations. The first was to develop a new analytical solution for a 3 D cavity excavated in an elastic half-space. The second was to adapt a fast parallelized finite element method to the SE and evaluate the feasibility of using in the stochastic inversion. To date we have demonstrated the ability of InSAR to detect underground facilities and measure the associated surface displacements by mapping surface deformations that track the excavation of the Los Angeles Metro system. The Stochastic Engine implementation has been completed and undergone functional testing...|$|R

It takes up artists who continued the earliest traditions of shunga (such as Kawanabe Kyosai and Tsukioka Yoshitishi) and those who developed new modes (among them, Tomioka Eisen). The new Meiji administration was anxious to suppress material it deemed inappropriate, and new censorship legislation was introduced in 1872. However, the <b>clandestine</b> <b>production</b> and sale of shunga continued until the early 1900 s.

40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{specifically the}} verification of a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT). Although {{it is not}} clear what will be the scope of the Treaty, e. g. whether nuclear materials produced prior to entry into force will be included and to what extent, many elements of the verification can be negotiated independently of the verification. The report starts with an overview of general principles underlying the verification. An important principle of verification is its credibility. Even in case of a very limited scope, the verification must create assurance that all nuclear materials produced after entry into force are being used for known and non-proscribed purposes. The other principle is nondiscrimination. All rights and obligations for verification must apply equally to all member states. During the negotiations, two questions will arise: firstly, whether the verification obligations of the non-nuclear weapon states are already met by the NPT verification, and secondly, how close the two verification systems will come. The verification tasks for both treaties are very similar and large differences in the verification systems would be interpreted as discrimination. The next chapter outlines which terms need to be defined more specifically. Several materials and material categories must be distinguished, and in most cases, it is useful to apply already existing IAEA definitions. Especially, it will be necessary to clarify what must be understood by the terms "production" or "fissile materials". Also the levels of assurance that will be considered satisfactory must be defined. These definitions will have implications on the intrusiveness of the verification. In the following chapter, the verification tasks at different facilities are illustrated. During the negotiations, it will have to be decided not only which materials should be covered but also which kinds of facilities with which verification activities must be included in these tasks. Facilities that are discussed in more detail in this chapter are reprocessing facilities, uranium enrichment facilities, and nuclear reactors. The next chapter explains in some detail major methods of verification. Methods are well developed because they are being used by the IAEA for the verification of the NPT. They include declarations on status, design information, and material accountancy; containment and surveillance techniques, inspections, and methods for the detection of undeclared activities as are being implemented by the recent IAEA safeguards reform. Many variations of which facilities should be included in the verification and which measures are considered appropriate are possible. In the following chapter, three scenarios with varying intrusiveness are presented and discussed. The first scenario includes only facilities capable of reprocessing and enrichment. The second scenario additionally includes nuclear reactors and all kinds of direct-use material. In this scenario, the <b>clandestine</b> <b>production</b> of spent fuel would be detected. Several categories of reactors are distinguished according to their sensitivity. In the third scenario, also the verification of the production of low enriched uranium would be included. The benefit would be the creation of higher assurance that <b>clandestine</b> <b>production</b> of highly enriched uranium would be detected. In the next chapter, some special problems are being discussed: The FMCT verification will also take place in states possessing nuclear weapons who might wish to protect sensitive information. Some of these states possess facilities that have never been subject to full-scope safeguards, and some of them might want to go on with the production of HEU for military naval reactors which will cause additional problems for verification.

The activity has been carried out taking the GIF PR&PP Evaluation Methodology and its Addendum as the general guideline for identifying potential nuclear material diversion targets. The targets proliferation attractiveness has been analysed in terms of the suitability of the targets’ nuclear material as the basis for its use in nuclear explosives. To this aim the PR&PP Fissile Material Type measure was supplemented by other literature studies, whose related metrics have been applied to the nuclear material items present in the considered core alternatives. This paper will firstly summarize the main ESFR design aspects relevant for PR following the structure of the GIF PR&PP White Paper template. An analysis on proliferation targets is then discussed, with emphasis on their characterization from a nuclear material point of view. Finally, a high‑level ESFR PR analysis according to the four main proliferation strategies identified by the GIF PR&PP Evaluation Methodology (concealed diversion, concealed misuse, breakout, <b>clandestine</b> <b>production</b> in clandestine facilities) is presented.

Proliferation resistance is a primary consideration in this design. The long life operation reduces the routine access to the internals of the reactor vessel, therefore reducing the possibility for <b>clandestine</b> <b>production</b> of nuclear weapons. Additionally, reduction of reactor shutdown time can result in improved safety and economics. As a first step, the most promising fuel lattice characteristics to achieve long life from a physics point of view are studied. These studies also define the design tradeoffs involved in conceptualizing such cores. Moderation effects on UO[subscript 2] fueled lattices are analyzed systematically using state-of-the-art computer codes (CASMO- 4 and MOCUP). The standard 4 -loop Westinghouse pressurized water reactor (PWR) is taken as our reference core and single unit cell analysis is employed. To change the moderator-to-fuel ratio, which {{is characterized by the}} hydrogen-to-heavy-metal (H/HM) atom number ratio, various methods are adapted including varying water density, fuel density, fuel rod diameter, and fuel rod pitch. Higher burnup potential as well as longer core endurance (burnup times heavy metal mass) would be desirable. For a given initial enrichment, the results show that higher reactivity-limited burnup is achievable by either a more wet lattice or much drier lattice than normal. However, epithermal lattices are distinctly inferior performers. In terms of longer endurance, current PWR lattice parameters are about the optimum. Higher burnup and endurance can be achieved with higher initial enrichment. Characteristics of the spent fuel from high burnup UO[subscript 2] fueled lattices have been examined. The variation of isotopic mix and quantity of plutonium with moderator-to-fuel ratio for UO[subscript 2] fueled lattices has been studied to clarify the impact on its proliferation resistance. And Np production as a function of H/HM has been computed as a measure of long-term radiological hazard for high level waste disposal. It is shown that Np is mildly affected by the H/HM ratio and the current PWR lattice is close to optimum configuration. However, high burnup is significantly beneficial as a way to make the plutonium isotopic mix less attractive as a weapon material. Idaho National Laborator...|$|E
