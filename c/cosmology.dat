We discuss the fundamental geometrodynamic aspects of VSL <b>cosmologies,</b> and provide several alternative implementations. These implementations provide a large class of VSL <b>cosmologies</b> that pass the zeroth-order consistency tests of being compatible with both classical Einstein gravity and low-energy particle physics. While they solve the "kinematic" puzzles as well as inflation does, VSL <b>cosmologies</b> typically do not solve the flatness problem since in their purest form no violation of the strong energy condition occurs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we give, {{for the first}} time, a {{qualitative}} description of the asymptotic dynamics of a class of non-tilted spatially homogeneous (SH) <b>cosmologies,</b> the so-called exceptional Bianchi <b>cosmologies,</b> which are of Bianchi type VI$_{- 1 / 9 }$. This class is of interest for two reasons. Firstly, it is generic within the class of non-tilted SH <b>cosmologies,</b> being of the same generality as the models of Bianchi types VIII and IX. Secondly, it is the SH limit of a generic class of spatially inhomogeneous $G_{ 2 }$ <b>cosmologies.</b> Using the orthonormal frame formalism and Hubble-normalized variables, we show that the exceptional Bianchi <b>cosmologies</b> differ from the non-exceptional Bianchi <b>cosmologies</b> of type VI$_{h}$ in two significant ways. Firstly, the models exhibit an oscillatory approach to the initial singularity and hence are not asymptotically self-similar. Secondly, at late times, although the models are asymptotically self-similar, the future attractor for the vacuum-dominated models is the so-called Robinson-Trautman SH model instead of the vacuum SH plane wave models.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{modifications to}} the Friedmann equation motivated by recent proposals along these lines pursuing an explanation to the observed late time acceleration. Here we show those modifications can be framed within a theory with self-interacting gravity, where the term self-interaction refers here {{to the presence of}} functions of ρ and p in the right hand side of the Einstein equations. We then discuss the construction of the duals of the <b>cosmologies</b> generated within that framework. After that we investigate the modifications required to generate generalized and modified Chaplygin <b>cosmologies</b> and show that their duals belong to a larger family of <b>cosmologies</b> we call extended Chaplygin <b>cosmologies.</b> Finally, by letting the parameters of those models take values not earlier considered in the literature we show some representatives of that family of <b>cosmologies</b> display sudden future singularities, which indicates their behavior is rather different from generalized or modified Chaplygin gas <b>cosmologies.</b> This reinforces the idea that modifications of gravity can be responsible for unexpected evolutionary features in the universe.

40|$|Non-singular two {{and three}} {{dimensional}} string <b>cosmologies</b> are constructed using the exact conformal field theories corresponding to SO(2, 1) /SO(1, 1) and SO(2, 2) /SO(2, 1). All semi-classical curvature singularities are canceled in the exact theories for both of these cosets, but some new quantum curvature singularities emerge. However, considering different patches of the global manifolds, allows the construction of non-singular spacetimes with cosmological interpretation. In both {{two and three}} dimensions, we construct non-singular oscillating <b>cosmologies,</b> non-singular expanding and inflationary <b>cosmologies</b> including a de Sitter (exponential) stage with positive scalar curvature as well as non-singular contracting and deflationary <b>cosmologies.</b> Similarities between the two and three dimensional cases suggest a general picture for higher dimensional coset cosmologies: Anisotropy {{seems to be a}} generic unavoidable feature, cosmological singularities are generically avoided and it is possible to construct non-singular <b>cosmologies</b> where some spatial dimensions are experiencing inflation while the others experience deflation. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the case}} of {{barotropic}} FRW <b>cosmologies,</b> the Hubble parameter in conformal time is the solution of a simple Riccati equation of constant coefficients. We consider these <b>cosmologies</b> {{in the framework of}} nonrelativistic supersymmetry that has been effective in the area of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Recalling that Faraoni [Amer. J. Phys. 67 (1999), 732 - 734] showed how to reduce the barotropic FRW system of differential equations to simple harmonic oscillator differential equations, we set the latter equations in the supersymmetric approach and divide their solutions into two classes of 'bosonic' (nonsingular) and 'fermionic' (singular) cosmological zero-mode solutions. The fermionic equations can be considered as representing <b>cosmologies</b> of Stephani type, i. e., inhomogeneous and curvature-changing in the conformal time. We next apply the so-called shifted Riccati procedure by introducing a constant additive parameter, denoted by S, in the common Riccati solution of these supersymmetric partner <b>cosmologies.</b> This leads to barotropic Stephani <b>cosmologies</b> with periodic singularities in their spatial curvature indices that we call U and V <b>cosmologies,</b> the first being of bosonic type and the latter of fermionic type. We solve completely these cyclic singular <b>cosmologies</b> at the level of their zero modes showing that an acceptable shift parameter should be purely imaginary, which in turn introduces a parity-time (PT) property of the partner curvature indices...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} barotropic {{perfect fluid}} <b>cosmologies</b> which admit an isotropic singularity. From the General Vorticity Result of Scott, {{it is known}} that these <b>cosmologies</b> must be irrotational. In this paper we prove, using two different methods, that if we make the additional assumption that the perfect fluid is shear-free, then the fluid flow must be geodesic. This then implies that the only shear-free, barotropic, perfect fluid <b>cosmologies</b> which admit an isotropic singularity are the FRW models. ...|$|R

We {{consider}} the asymptotic {{dynamics of the}} Einstein-Maxwell field equations for the class of non-tilted Bianchi <b>cosmologies</b> with a barotropic perfect fluid and a pure homogeneous sourcefree magnetic field, with emphasis on models of Bianchi type VII 0, which have not been previously studied. Using the orthonormal frame formalism and Hubble-normalized variables, we show that, {{as is the case}} for the previously studied class A magnetic Bianchi models, the magnetic Bianchi VII 0 <b>cosmologies</b> also exhibit an oscillatory approach to the initial singularity. However, in contrast to the other magnetic Bianchi models, we rigorously establish that typical magnetic Bianchi VII 0 <b>cosmologies</b> exhibit the phenomena of asymptotic self-similarity breaking and Weyl curvature dominance in the late-time regime.
