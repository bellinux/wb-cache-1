40|$|More than 70 % of the {{vineyards}} of Douro, the Port wine region, are planted in hillsides with a slope superior to 30 %. After the inscription of the Douro Valley in the "World Heritage list - UNESCO", in slopes higher than 30 % is mandatory that vineyards are planted in terraces {{with less than}} 2. 5 m wide and a single row of plantation. However narrow terraces have the disadvantage of a low planting density and consequently a low yield potential, circumstance the disencourages its use by grape growers. Because of that, an experiment was performed in a vineyard planted in terraces of 2. 3 m wide, and a single row of vines, with two alternatives of training. 1) the traditional vertical shoot positioning - VSP and 2) a double <b>cordon,</b> <b>trained</b> upwards and downwards, the LYS 2 / 3. Additionally, two pruning alternatives had been introduced in the <b>cordon</b> <b>trained</b> downwards of LYS 2 / 3, spur pruning (Royat) and can pruning. The variety used was Touriga Nacional, grafted in 110 R. The results obtained in 2005 and 2006 showed that yield in the LYS 2 / 3 system was 24 % {{higher than in the}} VSP. Regarding the quality parameters, both training systems reached good fruit sugar concentrations, 14. 0 for VSP and 12. 8 % v/v for LYS 2 / 3.

Coletaram-se bacelos provenientes de 24 vinhedos de plantas da {{cultivar}} Niagara Rosada enxertadas sobre o porta-enxerto IAC 572 'Jales', conduzidas em espaldeira e pérgula, que se encontravam na fase produtiva. Foram realizadas as seguintes avaliações: número de primórdios de inflorescência/gema primária (NPI/GP), número total de gemas/gema composta (NTG/GC) e número de gemas necrosadas (NGN). O delineamento foi em blocos casualizados, com 12 repetições, no esquema fatorial 2 x 10, usando-se como fatores dois sistemas de condução, em espaldeira e em pérgula; e dez posições da gema na vara, isto é, da basal à décima gema. Os blocos consistiram de 12 vinhedos de plantas conduzidas em espaldeira e outros 12 em pérgula. As médias dos dados foram comparadas pelo Teste de Tukey, a 5 % de probabilidade. Verificou-se que, nas videiras conduzidas em pérgula, as médias de fertilidade de gemas são maiores que as do sistema em espaldeira, e a fertilidade de gemas é crescente da base à porção terminal das varas, nos dois sistemas de condução analisados. The {{objective of}} this trial was to evaluate {{the influence of the}} <b>cordon</b> <b>training</b> and trellis, on bud fertility of the grapevine Niagara Rosada in the Region of Dourados, MS, during the period from May to June, 2004. The shoots were collected from 24 vineyards conducted on cordon-training or trellis. The bud fertility index was determined by the following ratios: number of primordia of inflorescence/primary buds, and the total number of buds/compound buds, and by the number of necrosed buds, from the first to the tenth dormant buds on the mature vine cane. The experimental design was complete randomized blocks with 12 repetitions, in a factorial 2 x 10. The factors studied were the <b>cordon</b> <b>training</b> and the trellis, and the bud position along the cane. The blocks consisted of 12 grapevines conduced on cordon-training and 12 conduced on trellis. The experimental unity consisted of 10 canes. Means were compared by the Tukey test at 5 %.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the impact of some viticultural {{practices}} (VP) and winemaking technologies (WT) on phenolic composition and sensory characteristics of Negroamaro wines produced in Apulia, Southern Italy. Among VP, two soil management (cover crop and soil tillage) and two training systems (bilateral cordon and unilateral cordon) were compared, whereas among WT, three vinifications were tested: control (traditional, 7 days of maceration at 25 °C with two daily punching-down), cryomaceration (24 h at 0 °C using dry ice) and ultrasound (37 kHz, 150 W, 15 min at 30 °C). Results showed that cover cropping decreased the concentration of flavonoids, whereas bilateral <b>cordon</b> <b>training</b> led to an increase of flavonoids and total polyphenols. Among technologies applied, the cryomaceration led to enrichment in anthocyanins and to impoverishment in total polyphenols, whereas ultrasound treatment improved the extraction of all phenol classes. Cryomacerated wines from the combination soil tillage and unilateral cordon were characterised by the best olfactory and gustatory sensory characteristics. Cryomaceration increased the notes of soft fruits and liquorice, whereas ultrasonic treatment did increase descriptors of violet, soft fruits and black pepper...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEach {{training}} system affecting the volatile concentration of wine {{is closely related}} to the specific growing conditions of grape. The aim of this work is to evaluate the influence of different {{training system}}s, such as crawled <b>cordon</b> <b>training</b> (CCT) and independent long-stem pruning (ILSP), on the volatile composition of Ecolly wine in Weibei Plateau region in three periods (July 31, August 10 and 24). Total aroma concentration (271. 15 mgL− 1) and ethyl octanoate concentration (84. 60 mgL− 1) were the highest for ILSP in August 24 in aroma compounds. However, total aroma concentration of CCT exceeded the ILSP in July 31 and August 10, respectively. ILSP could lead to higher acetate esters compared with CCT except for August 10. Ethanol esters were also strongly influenced by training systems in July 31 (CCT>ILSP) and August 24 (ILSP>CCT), except for slight influence in August 10. But other esters were not strongly impacted by training system. Despite the highest higher alcohols in ILSP in August 24, CCT still displayed significant higher concentration in the first two harvesting times than ILSP. Organic acids showed the same trend as higher alcohols in the experiment. Odor activity values (OAVs) of the 16 aromas compounds showed similar results. Results have shown that CCT improved the accumulation of aroma compounds in early wine, if harvesting time need to be postponed, ILSP was also a suitable select. Whereas, a strongly suggestion of CCT was made because stabilization of yield and quality could be guaranteed by CCT annually...|$|E

40|$|The “Piave” AOC is {{a modern}} winegrape growing area where {{mechanization}} is well-established and able to enhance the local viticulture; mechanization supports the competitiveness of wines as it allows to satisfy a wide market demand. Two different winter pruning techniques, manual and fully mechanized pruning, were considered and compared to no pruning. The effects on grape composition and health status were assessed, to verify whether preventing winter pruning produced changes in the metabolism of synthesis and accumulation of micro and macro-components in the berries. The trial was conducted in Ponte di Piave (TV), in two 12 year old <b>cordon</b> <b>trained</b> vineyards. In both vineyards the “no pruning” treatment consisted of a parcel that hadn’t been pruned for 7 years consecutively. Measurements and analysis were conducted both on the canopy and on the grapes. Regarding the ‘Pinot Gris’, {{the results of the}} first year of observations showed “manual pruning” reduced yield per vine by 50 % compared to the other two treatments without any substantial increase in berry quality. The health status of the grapes was significantly more satisfactory in the “no pruning” treatment.

40|$|High-altitude {{regions of}} {{southern}} Brazil, located above 900 m above sea level, the <b>cordon</b> <b>training</b> with spur pruning {{is widely used}} because of easier application. In these regions, Chardonnay wine grape shows potential to produce quality wines, however, in commercial vineyards, the training system used has not provided productivities that makes economically viable the cultivation of this variety. Given this, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of different cane-pruning systems on the vegetative, productive and enological potential of Chardonnay grapevines grown in the high-altitude region of Southern Brazil. The experiment was conducted in a commercial Chardonnay vineyard, located in São Joaquim – Santa Catarina State (28 o 17 ′ 39 ”S and 49 ∘ 55 ′ 56 ” W, to 1230 [*]m a. s. l) during 2015 and 2016 vintages. Chardonnay vines (grafted on 1103 Paulsen) were planted in 2010, with a 3. 0 [*]m (row) × 1. 0 [*]m (vine) spacing. The treatments consisted of different cane-pruning systems: Cordon spur-pruning (control); Sylvoz; Cazenave; Capovolto; single Guyot and double Guyot. Pruning was performed in August of each year when the buds were in the green tip developmental stage. Data was analyzed by Scott Knott test (p < 0. 05) following a randomized block design with four replicates, each consisting of 12 vines per plot. We observed higher yield in the Cazenave and double Guyot training system with three and two more tons of grapes than spur-pruning respectively. The bud fertility was higher in plants trained in double Guyot. Vines spur-pruned showed higher relation of leaf area: production, with values above 100 [*]cm 2 g− 1 grape at 2016 vintage. Commercial maturity of grapes (soluble solids, acidity and polyphenols) did not differ among training systems studied. The results suggest that cane-pruning systems could be an alternative to increase production efficiency of Chardonnay in high-altitude region of southern Brazil...|$|E

Results have shown that yield reduction and quality improvement are not always strictly related, especially when unthinned vines are characterized by a balanced vegetative/productive ratio. The trial was conducted {{over a two-year period}} (2003 - 2004) on cv Sangiovese, spur-pruned <b>cordon</b> <b>trained</b> (1 m x 2. 8 m spaced) in a hillside vineyard near Bologna. In the first year the vines were adjusted to 15 clusters per plant after fruit set and at veraison the plants were randomly divided in three groups: a) T 1, thinned at 10 clusters per vine; b) T 2, thinned at 5 clusters per vines and c) CK, unthinned vines. The same treatments were applied in the second year of experiments. The two years average data as concern the ratio between total leaf area and production at harvest was 2. 0, 3. 5 and 1. 3 m 2 /kg in T 1, T 2 and CK respectively, while sugar content of grapes (°Brix) was 22. 7 in T 1, 23. 1 in T 2 and 21. 8 in CK.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{relationship}} between carotenoid contents in grapevine berries and plant water status. For this purpose, a black grapevine variety, Vitis vinifera L. cv. Touriga Nacional, was studied. The experiments were {{carried out in the}} same Douro vineyards, with plants of the same age, in two different water retention soils. A higher water retention capacity soil, soil A, and a lower water retention capacity soil, soil B, were both in a 1. 2 m deep silt-loam schist-derived soil. The training system was the double <b>cordon</b> <b>trained</b> and spur pruned. A first range was nonirrigated (NI) and a second one was irrigated (I), 60 % of evapotranspiration (ET 0). For soil B, a 30 % of ET 0 treatment was also applied. The plant water status was estimated by predawn leaf water potential. The effects of plant water status on berry growth were studied by measurement of the berry weight and total soluble solids (°Brix). The carotenoid profile was quantitatively determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/diode array. Carotenoids determined were â-carotene, lutein, neoxanthin, violaxanthin, and luteoxanthin. The comparison between irrigated and nonirrigated grapes was followed from 2 weeks before veraison until the ripe stage. Results showed that at harvest time, berries exposed to the NI had a lower weight than those exposed to the irrigated treatment (60 % of ET 0), 0. 89 vs 1. 36 g/berry and 0. 94 vs 1. 34 g/berry, for soils A and B, respectively. The irrigated treatment contributed to a higher sugar concentration in both soils. However, depending on the soil water retention capacity, the carotenoid contents were different in soils A and B. For soil A, the total carotenoid content was similar for both NI and I treatments. However, with regard to soil B, in irrigated treatment, levels of carotenoids were approximately 60 % lower than those found for the NI. It seems to be possible to produce higher weight berries (with higher sugar levels) with similar carotenoid contents. On the other hand, soil characteristics had a larger influence than irrigation on the concentration of carotenoids in grapes, resulting in an important viticultural parameter to take into account in aroma precursor formation...|$|R
