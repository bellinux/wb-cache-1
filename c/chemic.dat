25|$|Football: Midland High boasts an {{excellent}} football program, coached by Eric Methner, along with Assistants Matthew Starling, Pete Welter and Scott Albrecht. Albrecht and Starling are graduates of Midland High. The <b>Chemics</b> have posted consecutive winning seasons {{for the past}} 37 years (since 1976), the second longest streak {{in the history of}} the state of Michigan. Midland High has also earned eight consecutive playoff berths, and 20 overall since 1983. Since 1950, Midland High has had only 5 losing seasons. The annual Midland High vs. Dow High game is considered one of the biggest high school football games in the state of Michigan, generally drawing around 10,000 spectators. Midland has dominated the series with a 31-10 overall record. The <b>Chemics</b> have two state championships (1957 and 1968), and have made it to the state championship game three times since then (1990, 1993, 2007).|$|R

No team had ever played more games in reaching Wembley than Widnes in 1964. In the first round, two replays were necessary before beating Leigh. Liverpool City were beaten in the second round, then Widnes played Swinton in front of 19,000 at Naughton Park. A 5-5 draw meant another replay, which was a scoreless draw at Station Road. A second replay at Wigan was watched by 21,369 with Widnes winning 15-3. The semi-final against Castleford was drawn 7-7. A crowd of 28,732 spectators watched the replay, which Widnes won.

50|$|The {{indifferent}} league form {{continued in}} 1974-75, {{as did the}} early exit from several cup competitions, the Challenge Cup being the exception. Warrington again reached Wembley to face Widnes; the <b>Chemics</b> winning 14-7. The first trophy was the Locker Cup won with a 14-9 victory over Wigan. Next was the Players No. 6 trophy, the final at Wigan against Rochdale Hornets providing a 27-16 win. Salford {{put an end to}} the success with a defeat in the first round of the BBC 2 Floodlit Trophy. A new competition, the Captain Morgan Trophy, provided the club with its third trophy of the season. Wins over Wigan, Castleford and Leeds led to the final against Featherstone Rovers which Warrington won 4-nil. However, the team continued to perform poorly in the league. Warrington defeated Huddersfield, Huyton and then Dewsbury were defeated to get to Wembley for the first time in twenty years. Warrington beat 24-9 Featherstone Rovers for the second time that season in a cup final to win the Challenge Cup. In the Merit Trophy play-off, Warrington played and beat Hull, Bradford Northern and then Wakefield Trinity in the semi final. The final at Wigan was against St. Helens, and after a great struggle Warrington won their fifth trophy, 13-12. Alex Murphy then retired as a player but continued to coach the side.|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} composit ion of {{the atmosphere}} is changing due to the trends in the f luxes of, for example, CO 2, SO 2, and NO, that are emitted from industr ial and cnergy combustion processes into the atmosphere. Forest ecosystems are unl ikely to react in any single, universal way, but rather {{there may be a}} large variabi l i ty of ecological reactions both in t ime and in space. This variabi l i ty is part ly due to the concentrat ion patterns of the emitted compounds. Also, in condit ions of a given load of pol lutants the ecological response may vary according to the ecosystem characterist ics. At this stage i t is extremely dif f icult to actual ly quanti fy the possible reac-t ions of forest ecosystems, so al l quanti tat ive scenarios should be examined cautiously because of this uncertainty. Quanti tat ive scenarios are not use-less, however, because they provide a systematic way of ranking and evaluating the dif ferent factors of uncertainty. That, in turn, improves our understanding of the phenomena. In this chapter we highl ight three issues, al l deal ing with the responses of forests to the trends in the chemical composit ion of the atmo-sphere. The f irst issue is that of forest damage currently being observed in Europe. Acid precipitat ion, the stress due to sulfur dioxide, ozone, and heavy metals, and the excess amount of deposit ing nitrogen compounds are conlmon denominators in this phenomenon. The two remaining issues are related to CO, emissions. The so-cal led CO, fert i l izat ion effect is due to the obvious possibi l i ty that the rate of tree photosynthesis wil l general ly increase as the air is given increasing amounts of one of the main substrates to photosynthesis, i. e., carbon dioxide. The greenhouse effect is related to CO, and other "greenhouse gases", which al l have a tendency to increase Forests and the Changling <b>Chemicd</b> Composition ol the Atmosphere I larth surface temperatures.

The purpose of this comparative study was to analyze fat- and fiber-related behavior (FFB) in patients with T 2 DM from distinct cultural areas. Patients and methods: Observational study {{was carried out in}} the Czech Republic (CR) (n= 200), the US (n= 207), and Yemen (n= 200). Patients completed the Fat- and Fiber-related Diet Behavior Questionnaire (FFBQ). Results: Differences in all aspects of FFB among countries were found (P< 0. 05). The best fat-related behavior reported was from patients from the CR. Patients from the US showed the worst fat-related behavior in total. On the other hand, patients from the US reported the best fiber-related behavior. Patients from Yemen reached the worst scores in all fat-related domains. Patients from all studied countries reported the best results in the “modify meat” and “avoid fat as flavoring” and the worst in the “substitute high fiber” subscales. Conclusion: Professionals involved in the diet education of T 2 DM patients {{should be aware of the}} specificity of diet in their country when advising patients keeping general recommendations. We suggest them to be as specific as possible and concentrate on fiber-related behavior.
