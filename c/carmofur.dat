40|$|Background: Oral <b>carmofur,</b> {{either as}} a single or in {{combination}} with other chemotherapeutic agents, has been used as adjuvant chemotherapy for curatively resected colon cancer patients. Past trialsandmeta-analyses indicate that it is somewhateffective inextendingsurvival of patients with this cancer. The objective {{of this study was to}} perform a reappraisal of randomized clinical trials conducted in this regard. Methods: We designed an individual patient-based meta-analysis of relevant clinical trials to examine thebenefit oforal <b>carmofur</b> for curatively resectedcoloncancer in termsofoverall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: We analyzed individual patient data of three randomized clinical trials, which met the predetermined inclusion criteria. These three trials had a combined total of 2152 patients, carmofurasadjuvantchemotherapycomparedwithsurgery-alone, 5 years follow-up, intention-to-treat-based analytic strategy and similar end points (OS and DFS). In a pooled analysis, 5 year OS rates were 80. 4 and 76. 4 %, and 5 year DFS rates 76. 9 and 71. 0 %, respectively, in <b>carmofur</b> and surgery-alone group. Oral <b>carmofur</b> had significant advantage over surgery-alone in terms of both OS [pooled hazard ratio, 0. 82; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 68 – 0. 99; P = 0. 043] and DFS (pooled hazard ratio, 0. 77; 95 % CI = 0. 65 – 0. 91; P = 0. 003). Conclusions: This individual patient-based meta-analysis demonstrated that oral <b>carmofur</b> significantly improves both OS and DFS in patients with curatively resected colon cancers.

40|$|The {{expression}} of acid ceramidase (AC) - a cysteine amidase that hydrolyses the proapoptotic lipid ceramide - is abnormally high in several human tumors, which is suggestive {{of a role}} in chemoresistance. Available AC inhibitors lack, however, the potency and drug-likeness necessary to test this idea. Here we show that the antineoplastic drug <b>carmofur,</b> which {{is used in the}} clinic to treat colorectal cancers, is a potent AC inhibitor and that this property is essential to its anti-proliferative effects. Modifications in the chemical scaffold of <b>carmofur</b> yield new AC inhibitors that act synergistically with standard antitumoral drugs to prevent cancer cell proliferation. These findings identify AC as an unexpected target for <b>carmofur,</b> and suggest that this molecule can be used as starting point for the design of novel chemosensitizing agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{evaluate}} the inhibitory effects of 5 -fluorouracil antineoplastics, cephem antibiotics containing the methyltetrazolylthiol (MTT) group and antidiabetics on aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in vivo and in vitro. In in vivo experiments, rats were given a 100 mg/kg dose of drugs (10 mg/kg for glibenclamide) orally or intraperitoneally. When each drug was administered singly immediately after an oral administration of 1. 5 g/kg ethanol, only <b>carmofur,</b> an antineoplastic, produced marked increases in blood acetaldehyde concentrations. This action was also noted when ethanol was ingested 15 h after administration. The remaining drugs did not increase blood acetaldehyde concentrations. When rats were treated with <b>carmofur</b> at 12 h intervals for 3 consecutive days and were given 1. 5 g/kg ethanol after the final treatment, blood acetaldehyde concentrations were elevated more significantly than with a single administration of <b>carmofur.</b> Furthermore, daily administration of cephem antibiotics containing the MTT group, latamoxef, cefamandole, cefoperazone and cefbuperazone, significantly increased blood acetaldehyde concentrations. Daily administration of sulfonylurea antidiabetics, chlorpropamide and acetohexamide, slightly increased blood acetaldehyde concentrations. Drugs causing increases in blood acetaldehyde concentrations when administration was combined with ethanol ingestion also inhibited ALDH activity in vitro. The results of the in vitro experiments roughly correlated with those of the in vivo experiments. The inhibitory effects of drugs on ALDH activity were in the following order: <b>carmofur</b> &# 62;&# 62; cephem antibiotics containing the MTT group &# 62; sulfonylurea antidiabetics. </p...|$|E
40|$|We studied {{longitudinally}} inflammatory {{reactions and}} serum C-reactive protein (S-CRP) levels in 52 colorectal cancer patients {{treated with a}} median of six 3 -weekly cycles of raltitrexed 1. 5 – 3. 0 [*]mg[*]m− 2 combined with oral <b>carmofur</b> (1 -hexylcarbomoyl- 5 -fluorouracil) 300 – 400 [*]mg[*]m− 2 on cycle days 2 – 14. Thirty-nine (75 %) of these patients had fever on days 2 to 9 after receiving raltitrexed, 49 (94 %) had fatigue Gr. ⩾ 1, and 49 (94 %) elevated S-CRP without a documented infection. The systemic inflammatory composite score (consists of body temperature, fatigue, S-CRP, interleukin- 6 (S-IL- 6), S-IL- 8, and tumour necrosis factor-α (S-TNFα) levels) was calculated in a cross-sectional one-cycle study involving 60 colorectal cancer patients treated with single-agent raltitrexed, raltitrexed and <b>carmofur,</b> or 5 -fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (n= 20 in each group). The median S-CRP, S-IL- 6, and S-TNFα levels were higher 7 days after giving raltitrexed (57 vs 23 [*]mg[*]l− 1, 64 vs 10 [*]ng[*]l− 1, and 11 vs 10 [*]ng[*]l− 1, respectively) or raltitrexed+carmofur (142 vs 10 [*]mg[*]l− 1, 64 vs 10 [*]ng[*]l− 1, and 16 vs 9 [*]ng[*]l− 1, respectively) than at baseline (P< 0. 01 for each comparison), but not when 5 -fluorouracil-based regimens were administered. These findings suggest that colorectal cancer patients treated with raltitrexed may develop drug-related systemic inflammation, which {{may be difficult to}} discriminate from infection...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Breast {{cancer is}} the second leading cause of cancer related deaths among females worldwide. Berbamine (BER), a kind of bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, {{has been used to}} treat {{clinical}} patients with inflammation and cancer for many years in China. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the activity of BER against highly-metastatic human breast cancer and its molecular mechanisms of action. Results In our study, we found that BER inhibits growth of highly-metastatic human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB- 231 and MDA-MB- 435 S cells dose-dependently and time-dependently. The sera from BER-treated rats suppress the growth of MDA-MB- 231 cells. BER shows synergistic effects with some existing anticancer agents such as trichostatin A (TSA, the histone deacetylase inhibitor), celecoxib (the inhibitor of COX- 2), and <b>carmofur</b> against the growth of MDA-MB- 231 cells. BER also displays the strong activity of inducing apoptosis in both estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB- 231 cells and estrogen receptor-alpha-positive MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, but not in normal human mammary epithelial cell line MCF 10 A. BER down-regulates anti-apoptotic protein Bcl- 2 levels and up-regulates pro-apoptotic protein Bax expressions in MDA-MB- 231 and MDA-MB- 435 S cells. BER also has synergistic effects with anticancer agents trichostatin A, celecoxib and/or <b>carmofur</b> on reducing Bcl- 2 /Bax ratios and VEGF secretions in MDA-MB- 231 cells. In addition, BER significantly suppresses cell migration and invasion, as well as decreases pro-MMP- 9 /pro-MMP- 2 activation in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, BER suppresses Akt and nuclear factor κ B signaling by reducing the phosphorylation of c-Met and Akt, and inhibiting their downstream targets such as nuclear factor κ B p- 65, Bcl- 2 /Bax, osteopontin, VEGF, MMP- 9 and MMP- 2 on protein and/or mRNA levels in breast cancer cells. Conclusion Our findings have showed that BER suppresses the growth, migration and invasion in highly-metastatic human breast cancer cells by possibly inhibiting Akt and NF- κ B signaling with their upstream target c-Met and downstream targets Bcl- 2 /Bax, osteopontin, VEGF, MMP- 9 and MMP- 2. BER has synergistic effects with anticancer agents trichostatin A, celecoxib and <b>carmofur</b> on inhibiting the growth of MDA-MB- 231 cells and reducing the ratio of Bcl- 2 /Bax and/or VEGF expressions in the cancer cells. These findings suggest that BER may have the wide therapeutic and/or adjuvant therapeutic application in the treatment of human breast cancer and other cancers. </p...|$|E
40|$|Human ovarian {{carcinoma}} {{cell line}} (COCL) behaves differently under different temperatures and/or anti-tumour drug <b>Carmofur</b> levels, which result in metabolic and ultrastructural {{changes of the}} tumour cells. The technique of microcalorimetry is adopted to investigate the metabolic behaviour of the tumour cells; while the technique of transmission electron microscopy is used to detect cells' ultrastructural changes. Quantitative analysis is also performed through image processing. The mechanisms of hyperthermia and chemotherapy in treatment of tumour cells are explored at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. It is shown that a high temperature reduces metabolic activity of the tumour cells, appears to cause both apoptosis and necrosis in COCL, and results {{in a series of}} malignant changes in the cell morphology. The concurrent application of hyperthermia and chemotherapy can speed up the apoptosis of the tumour cells and reduce cells' metabolic power. A sustained and longer action of such a concurrent application will lead to ultimate death of the tumour cells...|$|E
40|$|Acid ceramidase (AC) is an {{intracellular}} cysteine amidase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the lipid messenger ceramide. By regulating ceramide {{levels in}} cells, AC {{may contribute to}} the regulation of cancer cell proliferation and senescence and to the response to cancer therapy. We recently identified the antitumoral agent <b>carmofur</b> (4 a) as the first nanomolar inhibitor of intracellular AC activity (rat AC, IC 50 = 0. 029 μM). In the present work, we expanded our initial structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies around 4 a by synthesizing and testing a series of 2, 4 -dioxopyrimidine- 1 - carboxamides. Our investigations provided a first elucidation of the structural features of uracil derivatives that are critical for AC inhibition and led us to identify the first single-digit nanomolar inhibitors of this enzyme. The present results confirm that substituted 2, 4 -dioxopyrimidine- 1 -carboxamides are a novel class of potent inhibitors of AC. Selected compounds of this class may represent useful probes to further characterize the functional roles of AC. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|A case of renal cell {{carcinoma}} with multiple lung metastases successfully treated with interferon (IFN) following nephrectomy is reported. A 46 -year-old man consulted our institute complaining of left flank pain for 3 months on June 18, 1983. Macroscopic hematuria consisting of blood clot had also been found 1 week before. For a diagnosis of left renal carcinoma with multiple lung metastases, he was admitted. After total nephrectomy, 30 x 10 (6) units per day of natural IFN-beta were administered intravenously every other day for 2 months (total dose; 269 x 10 (6) units). One of the pulmonary lesions disappeared, but another increased in size and a new lesion was also found. Therefore, this trial was evaluated to be progression. Thereafter, he was treated with 600 mg/day of <b>carmofur</b> (HCFU) and was in a stable condition. As his lung lesions progressed at 11 months after nephrectomy, 9 x 10 (6) units/day of recombinant IFN-beta were additionally administered 5 {{days a week for}} 4 weeks. When the treatment was completed (total dose; 180 x 10 (6) units), the pulmonary lesions disappeared. The complete response lasted for 9 months.

40|$|Because xenosensing nuclear receptors {{are also}} lipid sensors that {{regulate}} lipid allocation, {{we hypothesized that}} toxicant-induced modulation of HR 96 activity would alter lipid profiles and the balance between adult survival and neonate production following exposure in Daphnia magna. Adult daphnids were exposed to unsaturated fatty acid- and toxicant- activators or inhibitors of HR 96 and later starved to test whether chemical exposure altered allocation toward survival or reproduction. The HR 96 activators, linoleic acid and atrazine, decreased reproduction as expected with concomitant changes in the expression of HR 96 regulated genes such as magro. The HR 96 inhibitors, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and triclosan, increased reproduction or neonate starvation survival, respectively. However, pre-exposure to triclosan increased in neonate survival {{at the expense of}} reproductive maturation. Lipidomic analysis revealed that sphingomyelins (SM) are predominantly found in neonates and therefore we propose are important in development. DHA and triclosan increased neonatal SM, consistent with HR 96 's regulation of Niemann-Pick genes. While DHA altered expression of magro, Niemann-Pick 1 b, mannosidase, and other HR 96 -regulated genes as expected, triclosan primarily perturbed sphingomyelinase and mannosidase expression indicating different but potentially overlapping mechanisms for perturbing SM. Overall, SM appears to be a key lipid in Daphnia maturation and further support was provided by <b>carmofur,</b> which inhibits sphingomyelin/ceramide metabolism and in turn severely represses Daphnia maturation and initial brood production. In conclusion, toxicants can perturb lipid allocation and in turn impair development and reproduction...|$|E
