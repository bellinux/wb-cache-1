25|$|Many {{of the new}} {{immigrant}} workers were Catholics, and their church had forbidden participation in secret societies since 1743, partially as a reaction against the anti-Catholicism of Freemasonry. But by the late 19th century, the Knights of Labor, a national and predominately Catholic organization, had 700,000 members seeking to represent all workers. In 1888 Archbishop James Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore sympathized with the workers and collaborated with other bishops to lift the prohibition against workers joining the KOL. Other workers also took actions, and unrest marked the following decades. In 1886 Samuel Gompers founded the American Federation of Labor for the skilled <b>craft</b> <b>trades,</b> attracting skilled workers from other groups. Other labor organizing followed.|$|E
25|$|The villages were {{historically}} mostly self-sufficient, with <b>craft</b> <b>trades</b> such as {{pottery and}} metalwork present {{in each of}} them. This meant {{that there was little}} need for close central control by the higher levels in the organisational hierarchy, and it also meant that trade between villages was minimal. Such traders as did exist were mostly concentrated in the port towns and consisted of immigrant Syrians, Muslims, Christians and Jews, with Hindu traders later arriving from other parts of India, as well as the Europeans. The Nairs were the sole members of the village organisations, which existed for such purposes as managing the affairs of the temples and, at one time, organising military training and deployment. A Nair family was considered {{to be part of the}} village organisation even if they had moved away from it. There were other castes in these villages, and other religious groups also, but they were excluded from the organisations. This arrangement was different from that found elsewhere in India, and another difference was that each house, whether for Nairs or otherwise, was usually in its own compound. There was no communal land, as existed elsewhere, and no communal plan for the village layout.|$|E

50|$|The first large trade union, the General Trades' Union (GTU), was {{organized}} in New York City on 14 August 1833 by delegates from nine <b>craft</b> <b>trades.</b> It celebrated {{with a public}} parade displaying its new emblem, a banner bearing a likeness of Archimedes lifting a mountain with a lever.

50|$|In 1939, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) {{supporters}} were {{expelled from the}} TLC, due {{to the demands of}} the American-based American Federation of Labor (AFL).

They negotiated with the All-Canadian Congress of Labour and founded the Canadian Congress of Labour in 1940 to rival the TLC. At its founding, it had 100,000 members, and grew to 250,000 by 1943.|$|E

5000|$|The land outwith the {{exempted}} portions {{began to}} be feued in the early 16th century. The Burgh Records record that in 1490 [...] "...all the haill counsale, deikynis of <b>craft</b> <b>trades,</b> and community consentit to the assedatioun feuing of {{the space of the}} burrowmuir", {{but it was not until}} 1508 that a Royal Charter issued by James IV gave the Council licence to feu, stipulating that [...] "the foresaid lands shall be leased in feu-farm as aforesaid, and their heirs and all dwellers on the same lands be subject to the jurisdiction of our foresaid Burgh, the Provost, Baillies and Officers thereof, present and to come, and that they repair every week with their victuals and other goods to the market of our said Burgh..." [...] A Council enactment of 30 April 1510 obliged the feuars [...] "to build upon the said acres dwelling-houses, malt-barns, and cowbills, and to have servants for the making of malt betwixt date? and Michaelmas 1512; and failing their doing so, to pay £40 to the common works of the town, and also to pay £5 for every acre of three acres of the Common Muir set to them". The Scottish lawyer and antiquarian William Moir Bryce (whose exhaustive researches inform much of this article), writing in an age influenced by the Temperance Movement, thought this a [...] "strange obligation", but it made sense at a time before piped urban water supplies, when beer was the common drink in preference to water drawn from lochs and wells which often proved injurious to health.|$|E

40|$|Aerial {{roots of}} hemiepiphytes are used {{throughout}} the Amazon Basin for house construction, basketry, traps and furniture. Here we describe how 15 species of hemiepiphytes are extracted by six indigenous groups in the Colombian Amazon for traditional artefacts, commercial crafts and as raw material for the furniture industry. Indigenous classification systems, use preferences, {{and the influence of}} the <b>craft</b> <b>trade</b> on indigenous livelihoods are discussed. The <b>craft</b> <b>trade</b> seems to improve the living conditions of local communities by making them less dependent from local guerrilla and coca production. However, we seriously question the sustainability of current fibre extraction. Designing adequate management plans for commercial hemiepiphytes is essential to guarantee the future supply of these valuable non-timber forest products...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{provides}} a detailed cost structure {{analysis of the}} construction of four single-family houses on different locations in the municipalities of Ljubljana and Brezovica in different time periods. The calculation of costs of construction, <b>craft</b> <b>trades</b> and installation works, other construction-related costs and the market value estimate served as the basis for determining both the cost and sales price of the single-family houses. The analysis of the cost price structure suggests that construction, <b>craft</b> <b>trades</b> and installation works represent the largest portion of costs amounting to 59. 82 % of the cost price of single-family house No. 1. Purchase of land represents 45. 66 % of the cost price of single-family house No. 3. The analysis of the cost and sales price indicates that they were rising until 2008 and then suffered a fall. The main reasons for escalating prices lie in increasing costs related to the purchase of land, building material costs, construction costs and other costs inherent to the construction of single-family houses. The results are in line with the data of the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia...|$|E
40|$|Diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{renovation}} of the building Zdraviliški dom in Rimske Toplice. The building has 5 floors and is shaped in a form of a letter C. On the ground floor there is a central wing with historical baths. Due to long-term decaying, the construction needs to be additionally settled, renovated and converted into hotel rooms. Diploma paper comprises four chapters: The first chapter includes {{a description of a}} building in Rimske Toplice, a short historical outline of the Rimske Toplice Health Resort, and concludes with a description of the current state. The second chapter is entitled The beginning of renovation works and describes investor's decision-making policy, proposed renovation plan, the process of documentation acquiring, scheme presentation, construction site plan and the timeline of the renovation implementation. The third chapter is entitled Building renovation. It describes foundation and redevelopment works, including a description of construction work, <b>craft</b> <b>trades</b> and installation works. The first part of the third chapter focuses on the identified condition, it is followed by a description of an architectural concept and finishes with a description of the renovation implementation. The works comprised inadequate foundations, static and seismological stiffing and the elimination of moisture. Construction work, <b>craft</b> <b>trades</b> and installation works comprised roof, façade and arches renewal, construction of new AB concrete foundation plane, flooring, lowered ceilings, plastered walls, bathroom equipment, electrical and mechanical installation.

40|$|The thesis {{provides}} a deep {{insight into the}} entire process of landslide remediation in Dašnica, Železniki. The process is presented {{from the perspective of}} the service provider, i. e. from the public tender to the handover phase. The landslide was remedied with reinforced concrete piles, geotechnical anchors and reinforced concrete walls. Moreover, the thesis points to the significance of those procedures and discusses the implementation process as well as all the necessary research. It concludes with a cost analysis of the project based on the engineering pro forma invoice, the tender pro forma invoice and the final account. The findings indicate that such a remediation project mainly involves construction works and <b>craft</b> <b>trades,</b> earthworks and foundations...|$|E
