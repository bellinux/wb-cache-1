5000|$|Part one (15:30-17:42) is {{composed}} mainly of electronic noises. Furthermore, {{it is the}} only section on this album to feature the Mellotron; Wright uses the [...] "3 Violins" [...] and [...] "Flute" [...] registration in order to create the dissonant <b>chord</b> <b>clusters</b> throughout this sound collage. A distorted voice says [...] "Here is a loud announcement!" [...] about 10 seconds before the next part starts. This section ends with a sound effect from the EMI archive of a steam train passing.|$|R
25|$|Two-note combinations, whether {{referred}} to as chords or intervals, are called dyads. Chords constructed of three notes of some underlying scale are described as triads. Chords of four notes are known as tetrads, those containing five are called pentads and those using six are hexads. Sometimes the terms trichord, tetrachord, pentachord, and hexachord are used—though these more usually refer to the pitch classes of any scale, not generally played simultaneously. Chords that may contain more than three notes include pedal point chords, dominant seventh chords, extended chords, added tone <b>chords,</b> <b>clusters,</b> and polychords.|$|R
500|$|In jazz, as in {{classical}} music, tone clusters {{have not been}} restricted to the keyboard. In the 1930s, the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra's [...] "Stratosphere" [...] included ensemble clusters among an array of progressive elements. The Stan Kenton Orchestra's April 1947 recording of [...] "If I Could Be With You One Hour Tonight," [...] arranged by Pete Rugolo, features a dramatic four-note trombone cluster {{at the end of}} the second chorus. As described by critic Fred Kaplan, a 1950 performance by the Duke Ellington Orchestra features arrangements with the collective [...] "blowing rich, dark, tone clusters that evoke Ravel." [...] <b>Chord</b> <b>clusters</b> also feature in the scores of arranger Gil Evans. [...] In his characteristically imaginative arrangement of George Gershwin's [...] "There's a boat that's leaving soon for New York" [...] from the album Porgy and Bess, Evans contributes <b>chord</b> <b>clusters</b> orchestrated on flutes, alto saxophone and muted trumpets as a background to accompany Miles Davis' solo [...] In the early 1960s, arrangements by Bob Brookmeyer and Gerry Mulligan for Mulligan's Concert Jazz Band employed tone clusters in a dense style bringing to mind both Ellington and Ravel. Eric Dolphy's bass clarinet solos would often feature [...] "microtonal clusters summoned by frantic overblowing." [...] Critic Robert Palmer called the [...] "tart tone cluster" [...] that [...] "pierces a song's surfaces and penetrates to its heart" [...] a specialty of guitarist Jim Hall's.|$|R
30|$|This is {{followed}} by a chain of cadences, which drives the key from G flat minor, a tritone relationship to tonic, with E flat acting as a flat six, an enharmonically augmented fifth again acting as a six chord, which then resolves to G major and returns to tonic. There are four measures, which are driven by plagal cadences, which end with authentic cadences. All sequential material is varied to avoid repetition. These serve a dual purpose, they appear to be <b>chord</b> <b>clusters</b> and exude all the color of them, yet we feel the underlying driving force of cadential resolution.|$|R
5000|$|The Fifth Sonata was {{composed}} 29 {{years after the}} Fourth and is in ten parts, performed without a break. As a whole, the sonata has an obsessive D4 that allows for cohesion of all the parts. Like the Sixth sonata, this work features <b>chord</b> <b>clusters</b> and violent dynamic contrasts - Alex Ross even commenting that, [...] "she has colonized the higher end of the dynamic spectrum much as Morton Feldman took possession of the lower." [...] The music also features an economical use of thematic material - mostly quarter notes in two-part counterpoint at a moderately slow tempo.|$|R

5000|$|Sonata No. 6 of 1988 is a {{physically}} violent work which utilizes thick <b>chord</b> <b>clusters</b> throughout. Because of its ffff clusters, musicologist Maria Cizmic explains, [...] "It {{opens up a}} performance space in which a pianist feels pain, foregrounding the concrete bodily acts and sensations of suffering {{at a time when}} the violence of the USSR's past continued to be contested." [...] Its first tempo indication, Expressivissimo, is one indication of its hyper expressionality. Even through such dissonance, a number of melodies can be heard, usually the top note of each cluster. Before the final restatement of the first theme, a series of six chords, played as softly and chorale-like as possible, provides a moment of stillness.|$|R
25|$|Gondwanaland's next album, Wide Skies (1992) {{came after}} touring {{northern}} Australia and includes guest performances by Bobby Bunuggurr, Cleis Pierce, Maroochy Barambah, Andrew de Teliga (Sirocco), Blair Greenberg, Pee Wee Ferris and Carl Zhang. It {{was produced by}} Martin Armiger, recorded from 1990 to 1992 in both Sydney and the Northern Territory, and was released by WEA. Gone were the earthy good time romps and quiet moments of reflection, now complex panoramic <b>chord</b> <b>clusters</b> enveloped the arrangements in an almost overwhelming evocation {{of the sky and}} all that happens in and under it.

5000|$|A Imitation of {{the sounds}} at night in a Hungarian summer, tonal centre G or {{ambiguous}} tonality. A highly dissonant arpeggiated <b>cluster</b> <b>chord</b> (E,F,G,G,A) is repeated throughout the section on the beat. On top of this, six imitations of natural sounds (birds, cicadas, and the particular Hungarian unka frog) are scored in a random fashion. This material is found in bars 1-17, 34-37, 48, and 67-71. There and small quotes in bars 25-26 and in 60, while the arpeggiated <b>cluster</b> <b>chord</b> is often inserted in the B and C material.|$|R
500|$|Drake was obsessive about practising {{his guitar}} technique, and would often stay {{up through the}} night experimenting with tunings and working on songs. His mother remembered hearing him [...] "bumping around at all hours. I think he wrote his nicest melodies in the early-morning hours." [...] Self-taught, he {{achieved}} his guitar style {{through the use of}} alternative tunings to create <b>cluster</b> <b>chords.</b> These are difficult to achieve on a guitar using standard tuning; Drake used tunings which made <b>cluster</b> <b>chords</b> available using more conventional chord shapes. In many songs he accents the dissonant effect of such non-standard tunings through his vocal melodies.|$|R
5000|$|Wide pitch ranges in glissandi, {{jumps and}} {{doublings}} over many octaves. This contrasts heavily with <b>cluster</b> <b>chords</b> of adjacent notes and trills and may well {{add to the}} evocation of spaciousness or loneliness.|$|R
50|$|The {{piece is}} {{in only one}} {{movement}} and takes around 12 minutes to perform. It is scored for four first violins, three second violins, two violas, two cellos and one double bass, {{even though it is}} clarified by Xenakis that it can also be performed by a larger string orchestra or ensemble. Aroura makes an extensive use of glissandos, jagged <b>chords,</b> sound <b>clusters</b> and other techniques exploited in avant-garde movements.|$|R
40|$|Vehicular {{network is}} {{different}} from wired network due to its network environment changes rapidly. The connection lifetime between vehicles is usually short because vehicles move in high speeds. Hence, deploy peer-to-peer (p 2 p) applications over vehicular network is a challenging research issue. There are many problems confronted in p 2 p file sharing over vehicular network. Therefore, how to search files effectively, how to share files with distant vehicles, how to fully utilize the limited bandwidth, etc. have became important issues. In this paper, we propose an infrastructure-based Urban Multi-Layered Chord (UML-Chord) architecture for p 2 p file sharing over an urban vehicular network. In this architecture, vehicles are grouped into <b>clusters.</b> A multi-layer <b>chord</b> is employed to manage both files information and clustered vehicles locations. Connection lifetime between vehicles is estimated on a traffic aware basis. Target vehicle selection considers connection lifetime, bandwidth, and vehicle transmission status. Simulations results show that UML-Chord outperforms <b>Chord,</b> <b>clustered</b> organization and overlay based approaches in terms of number of hops (per query), control message overhead, query delay time, average download time, and file complete ratio...|$|R
50|$|This piece {{consists}} of five melodic episodes. They are prefaced and separated (except {{for the fourth}} and fifth episode) by 'ritornello' type sections of repeated <b>cluster</b> <b>chords</b> in a clashing rhythm (duplets in 6/8 measure).|$|R
5000|$|An ostinato {{sound on}} every {{beat in the}} slow {{prevailing}} tempo, often this sound is dissonant, and/or a <b>cluster</b> <b>chord.</b> Because of the slow and repetitive nature, these sounds come to fulfil an accompanying or background role.|$|R
5000|$|Mankey {{considered}} Love You to be [...] "lighthearted" [...] on the surface, but a [...] "serious, autobiographical" [...] {{work that}} could be compared somewhat to Eraserhead. Writer Chris Shields observed: [...] "If it wasn't for the synthesizer-heavy production, it's almost punk. Simple messages, conveyed in a straight-forward fashion. Even the beautiful moments are grounded in basic living. ... The vocals are gruff. Synthesizers are everywhere. The lyrics can be immature or come from a youthful perspective." [...] Beach Boys engineer Alan Boyd said of Wilson's methods: [...] "In {{a lot of the}} material from Love You, Brian was working very quickly on his own. ... Brian did this very interesting thing and it goes back to his early days too, for rhythm he’d often use guitars and piano to fulfill the same rhythm function as a high-hat. He’d always have these eighth notes but there’d be these <b>chord</b> <b>clusters.</b> I think he liked the tack piano because it had that sort of percussive click on it and it sort of fulfills the same function as a high-hat except with all these notes so it makes everything sort of swirl." ...|$|R
30|$|According to Nest’ev, {{he had a}} “…guileless spontaneity and {{purity of}} feeling… [and] … a vivid, uncanny remembrance of {{childhood}} (Nest’ev, 1960 o, p. 457).” He loved fairy tales, Russian folklore and epic adventure. He had a unique understanding of what appealed to children, which became apparent in other pieces such as: Cinderella, The Ugly Duckling, On Guard for Peace, Fairy Tale and The Stone Flower (Nest’ev, 1960 o, p. 457). And, {{he always had a}} knack for appealing to his “market (Robinson, 2002 d, p. 307).” His Music for Children was such a great success that he later transcribed it into a children’s suite for small orchestra entitled, A Summer Day. In Robinson’s biography, he compares the Music for Children to Suggestion Diabolique or 4 Pieces for Piano, opus 3. He admits they are less dissonant, and not as difficult in harmony and text, but asserts that some of them are just as ‘accomplished’ as the aforementioned pieces. He particularly likes Tarantella and the impressionistic quality of The Rain and the Rainbow “…in which dissonant clusters of major seconds alternate with scales and chords in “bright” C major (Robinson, 2002 d, p. 307).” It is a tone painting. I believe that the tapping eighth note rhythms and <b>chord</b> <b>clusters</b> represent raindrops. The tonal movement of the piece is akin to an arch and may be a representation of a rainbow.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Thom Jurek states [...] "The first disc {{features}} Taylor {{playing at the}} beginning of his residency in June, performing solo. As is characteristic, he begins slowly, but that's brief. The dynamics and hammering runs of enormous <b>chord</b> <b>clusters</b> and constructively built pyramids of middle-range and lower-register notes cascade from his hands in bursts in the opening section of the lengthy [...] "Reinforced Concrete." [...] Covering 65 minutes of this 72-minute set, this mammoth work allows all the wonderful elements of Taylor's sound architecture to be on display simultaneously... On disc two, recorded the next evening, Taylor is in duet with the great lyrical drummer Günter Sommer. Sommer has a true command of glissando, not only in his captivating and astonishing cymbal work (which opens the first of these three parts), but also his work on the floor tom, making it seem to dance in midair while holding down the fort. Taylor's interaction with him is one that is completely complementary. Taylor has been in dynamic, overpowering duos of force before — most notably with Sunny Murray — but what takes place here, perhaps because of its great energy, is something totally different. While this is free and unrehearsed, the relaxed notion of one player leading the other, following one another, and turning into and out of the angular structures feels effortless... Highly recommended".|$|R
50|$|Chordal {{relationships}} that {{occur as a}} result of the polyphony, homophonic parallelism and homophonic polyphony found in African music are not always 'functional' in the western musical sense. However, they accomplish the balance of tension-release and dissonance-consonance. In addition, they form varieties of <b>chord</b> combinations and <b>clusters,</b> as well as varying levels of harmonic patterning.|$|R
5000|$|The next piano tumbao uses <b>cluster</b> <b>chords.</b> {{it is also}} {{unusual in}} that Duarte leaves out the F natural from the {{previous}} variant.

His tumbaos eventually return to a familiar opening phrase and reestablish the harmonic equilibrium.|$|R
50|$|The many precise {{dynamic and}} stress signs witness how Bartók aimed for very {{specific}} performance and sound effects. Three footnotes in the score {{deal with the}} exact execution of arpeggios and grace note figurations.

5000|$|Critic Brian Morton {{wrote in}} 2010 that Hawkins Hammond playing was [...] "essentially pianistic. Even the <b>clustered</b> <b>chords</b> and wheezy shimmers ... have {{the attack and}} {{articulation}} of piano", and that Hawkins was [...] "The most interesting Hammond player {{of the last decade}} and more, he has already extended what can be done on the instrument and how far out it can be pushed".|$|R
5000|$|Micropolyphony {{is a kind}} of {{polyphonic}} musical texture {{developed by}} György Ligeti and then imitated by some other twentieth-century composers, which consists of many lines of dense canons moving at different tempos or rhythms, thus resulting in tone clusters vertically. According to David Cope, [...] "micropolyphony resembles <b>cluster</b> <b>chords,</b> but differs in its use of moving rather than static lines"; it is [...] "a simultaneity of different lines, rhythms, and timbres" [...]|$|R
50|$|The most {{significant}} {{addition to the}} standard xylophone skill set is the McLellan Technique, developed at Indiana University in the early 21st century. This technique involves placing {{the head of a}} mallet in between two adjacent bars, and rapidly spinning the shaft of the mallet in between the index finger and thumb, thereby causing the head to rotate rapidly and scrape against both bars. This creates a <b>cluster</b> <b>chord</b> with ethereal timbre, and is most commonly used in percussion ensemble repertoire.|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedDominick Argento (b. 1927) is a {{well-known}} composer living in the United States. He studied at the Peabody Conservatory and Eastman School of Music under such highly-regarded teachers as Hugo Weisgall, Henry Cowell, and Howard Hanson. He had a distinguished career for nearly forty years as a Professor of composition at the University of Minnesota. Argento is most widely known for his success in composing operas and song cycles, however, his choral works are {{a significant portion of}} his oeuvre.; Paramount in Argento's musical style is his use of melody. The majority of his music is written for the voice, and his knowledge of that instrument is apparent throughout his repertory. Argento's compositions are tonal, but often employ innovative harmonic progressions, <b>chord</b> <b>clusters,</b> and bi-chordal elements. Tight structure and unusual combinations of performing forces support the content, drama, and emotion of the text.; "A Toccata of Galuppi's" is a twenty-minute work written for chamber choir, string quartet, and harpsichord. This work requires further study for the many interesting musical events created through the use of dodecaphony, the unusual combination of performing forces, and poetic content. There is little written about this work other than a short analysis included in a dissertation of a survey of his choral works.; Argento's vast knowledge of literature is exhibited by his sophisticated choice of texts in his works. Robert Browning's poem allows Argento to draw from three different time periods in "Galuppi": the eighteenth-century, the nineteenth-century, and Argento's twentieth-century. Argento includes quotations from two of Galuppi's keyboard sonatas, and the string quartet provides accompaniment to both the chorus and the harpsichord. The work is dramatic, even theatrical, and recitative and text painting are used to enhance the drama.; This combination of performing forces is unusual in both Argento's repertory and twentieth-century choral repertoire. His use of technique within this work is artful, specifically his writing for voices and his successful merger of different musical time periods. Deservedly, A Toccata of Galuppi's is assured a place in the pantheon of important modern choral works...|$|R
40|$|Work for Classical Guitar and Live Electronics. Inspired by glaciers (and {{the rivers}} that run through them), this piece is built entirely on a tone row subject to {{conventional}} transformations. The electronics {{have the ability}} to stop, slow and reverse time of the guitar’s output and so can run through the tone rows independently, and can freeze and morph them into a backdrop of <b>cluster</b> <b>chords.</b> The middle section is reminiscent of a jazz walking bass (but still entirely serial), which transform into an ensemble interplay of guitar and electronics...|$|R
5000|$|Stockhausen's design {{appears to}} have been to select an equal number of {{fragments}} from each row (degree of complexity of subdivision) and each column (overall duration of the fragment), except for the first column (shortest duration) and last row (most complex subdivision). This is suggested {{by the fact that he}} originally selected column 6, row 3 for the last fragment (marked with an x in the illustration), then changed his mind in favor of the lower-right cell [...] When writing out the fragments, Stockhausen doubled the note values from the ones in the matrix , so that, in the score, fragments 1-4, 5-7, 8-10, 11-13, 14-16, and 17-19 have overall durations of 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, and 28 quarter notes, respectively. Within each of these groups there is a [...] "main text" [...] of melody or chords.

In it {{he tries to}} evoke upward-swirling figurations and downward-cascading waterfalls simultaneously, and somehow pulls it off. The music quivers with spiraling riffs, piercing contrapuntal lines and pungent <b>cluster</b> <b>chords</b> that ecstatically leap about the keyboard." [...] Michael Oliver of Gramophone similarly opined, [...] "Traced Overhead is filled with mysterious, glancing references to remembered piano music, but is grippingly coherent." ...|$|R

The sound simulates three musicians at once; a bass player, a rhythm guitarist and a solo guitarist or a Greek electric bouzouki.
