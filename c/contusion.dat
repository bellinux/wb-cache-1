5|$|A {{pulmonary}} <b>contusion</b> {{is usually}} caused directly by blunt trauma {{but can also}} result from explosion injuries or a shock wave associated with penetrating trauma. With the use of explosives during World Wars I and II, pulmonary <b>contusion</b> resulting from blasts gained recognition. In the 1960s its occurrence in civilians began to receive wider recognition, in which cases it is usually caused by traffic accidents. The use of seat belts and airbags reduces the risk to vehicle occupants.|$|E
5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary <b>contusion</b> is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the <b>contusion</b> may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary <b>contusion</b> is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
5|$|A lung <b>contusion</b> is {{a bruise}} caused by chest trauma. It results in {{hemorrhage}} of the alveoli causing a build-up of fluid which can impair breathing, {{and this can}} be either mild or severe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Contusions</b> of both {{surfaces}} of the knee joint are known as kissing <b>contusions.</b> These <b>contusions</b> are generally found by magnetic resonance imaging and most cases are associated with ligamentous or menisceal injuries.|$|R
40|$|Intracerebral <b>contusions</b> {{can lead}} to {{regional}} ischemia caused by extensive release of excitotoxic aminoacids leading to increased cytotoxic brain edema and raised intracranial pressure. rCBF measurements might provide further information {{about the risk of}} ischemia within and around <b>contusions.</b> Therefore, the aim of the presented study was to compare the intra- and perilesional rCBF of hemorrhagic, non-hemorrhagic and mixed intracerebral <b>contusions.</b> In 44 patients, 60 stable Xenon-enhanced CT CBF-studies were performed (EtCO 2 30 +/- 4 mmHg SD), initially 29 hours (39 studies) and subsequent 95 hours after injury (21 studies). All lesions were classified according to localization and lesion type using CT/MRI scans. The rCBF was calculated within and 1 -cm adjacent to each lesion in CT-isodens brain. The rCBF within all <b>contusions</b> (n = 100) of 29 +/- 11 ml/ 100 g/min was significantly lower (p < 0. 0001, Mann-Whitney U) compared to perilesional rCBF of 44 +/- 12 ml/ 100 g/min and intra/perilesional correlation was 0. 4 (p < 0. 0005). Hemorrhagic <b>contusions</b> showed an intra/perilesional rCBF of 31 +/- 11 / 44 +/- 13 ml/ 100 g/min (p < 0. 005), non-hemorrhagic <b>contusions</b> 35 +/- 13 / 46 +/- 10 ml/ 100 g/min (p < 0. 01). rCBF in mixed <b>contusions</b> (25 +/- 9 / 44 +/- 12 ml/ 100 g/min, p < 0. 0001) was significantly lower compared to hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic <b>contusions</b> (p < 0. 02). Intracontusional rCBF is significantly reduced to 29 +/- 11 ml/ 100 g/min but reduced below ischemic levels of 18 ml/ 100 g/min in only 16 % of all <b>contusions.</b> Perilesional CBF in CT normal appearing brain closed to <b>contusions</b> is not critically reduced. Further differentiation of <b>contusions</b> demonstrates significantly lower rCBF in mixed <b>contusions</b> (defined by both hyper- and hypodense areas in the CT-scan) compared to hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic <b>contusions.</b> Mixed <b>contusions</b> may evolve from hemorrhagic <b>contusions</b> with secondary increased perilesional cytotoxic brain edema leading to reduced cerebral blood flow and altered brain metabolism. Therefore, the treatment of ICP might be individually modified by the measurement of intra- and pericontusional cerebral blood...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac <b>contusions</b> {{are being}} {{recognized}} with frequency. Among 507 patients with non-penetrating chest injuries, 210 had serial electrocardiograms sufficient {{to evaluate the}} heart. Forty-five of these 210 patients (21 %) had cardiac <b>contusions.</b> These 45 patients and 3 others who were confirmed to have cardiac <b>contusions</b> at necropsy, comprise the 48 patients in this series. Life-indangering cardiac complications occurred in 14 (29 %) of the 48 patients, and 4 patients died. The development of cardiac complications following cardiac <b>contusions</b> {{appears to have a}} significant relationship to the presence of shock, hypoxia and to factors related to the severity of multiple injuries. These observations have therapeutic implications in management of patients with cardiac <b>contusions</b> through prevention of hypovolemia and hypoxia and avoidance of fluid overload as well as treatment of specific cardiac complications...|$|R
5|$|The {{physical}} processes behind pulmonary <b>contusion</b> are poorly understood. However, {{it is known}} that lung tissue can be crushed when the chest wall bends inward on impact. Three other possible mechanisms have been suggested: the inertial effect, the spalling effect, and the implosion effect.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying {{injuries}} often play a {{key role}} in the outcome. Injuries that may accompany TBI include pulmonary <b>contusion</b> and laceration; and fractures of the sternum, ribs and clavicles. Spinal cord injury, facial trauma, traumatic aortic rupture, injuries to the abdomen, lung, and head are present in 40–100%. The most common accompanying injury is esophageal perforation or rupture (known as Boerhaave syndrome), which occurs in as many as 43% of the penetrating injuries to the neck that cause tracheal injury.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia, another {{potential}} complication, develops {{in as many}} as 20% of people with pulmonary <b>contusion.</b> Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and mechanical ventilation further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the tube is passed through the nose or mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. The sooner the endotracheal tube is removed, the lower the risk of pneumonia, but if it is removed too early and has to be put back in, the risk of pneumonia rises. People who are at risk for pulmonary aspiration (e.g. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. As with ARDS, the chances of developing pneumonia increase with the size of the <b>contusion.</b> Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with pneumonia and ARDS.|$|E
50|$|Old or remote <b>contusions</b> are {{associated}} with resorption of the injured tissue, resulting in various degrees of cavitation, {{in addition to the}} presence of a golden-yellow discoloration due to residual hemosiderin. These remote <b>contusions</b> are often referred to as plaque jaune or yellow plaque.|$|R
30|$|Patients and methods: Retrospective study {{conducted}} {{for a period}} of 8  years (January 01, 2005 –December 31, 2012) in a medical surgical intensive care unit. All trauma patients younger than 15  years were included. Two groups were compared—those with lung <b>contusions</b> (C + group) and those without lung <b>contusions</b> (C − group).|$|R
40|$|Injuries to the {{quadriceps}} muscle group occur {{frequently in}} sports and athletic activities. Muscle strains and <b>contusions</b> constitute {{the majority of these}} injuries. The clinical presentation and assessment of quadriceps strains and <b>contusions</b> are reviewed along with discussion of appropriate imaging used in diagnosis. Treatment protocols for acute injuries are reviewed including rehabilitation techniques frequently utilized during recovery. Special consideration is given to discussing the criteria for return to sports for athletes after injury. Myositis ossificans is a potentially disabling complication from quadriceps <b>contusions</b> and risk factors, prevention, and treatment are reviewed...|$|R
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{take time to}} develop, {{and as many as}} half of cases are asymptomatic at the initial presentation. The more severe the injury, the more quickly symptoms become apparent. In severe cases, symptoms may occur as quickly as three or fourhours after the trauma. Hypoxemia (low oxygen concentration in the arterial blood) typically becomes progressively worse over 24–48hours after injury. In general, pulmonary <b>contusion</b> tends to worsen slowly over a few days, but it may also cause rapid deterioration or death if untreated.|$|E
5|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} {{are most often}} caused by physical trauma. Forces involved can be hyperflexion (forward movement of the head); hyperextension (backward movement); lateral stress (sideways movement); rotation (twisting of the head); compression (force along the axis of the spine downward from the head or upward from the pelvis); or distraction (pulling apart of the vertebrae). Traumatic SCI can result in <b>contusion,</b> compression, or stretch injury. It is a major risk of many types of vertebral fracture. Pre-existing asymptomatic congenital anomalies can cause major neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis, to result from otherwise minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|Subarachnoid blood can be {{detected}} on CT scanning {{in as many as}} 60 percent of people with traumatic brain injury. Traumatic SAH (tSAH) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral <b>contusion.</b> It usually happens in the setting of other forms of traumatic brain injury and has been linked with a poorer prognosis. It is unclear, however, if this {{is a direct result of}} the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms.|$|E
30|$|D’Avella et al. {{state that}} {{cerebellar}} <b>contusions</b> {{make up only}} 0.54 % of all head injuries. He categorized the type of injuries causing cerebellar <b>contusions</b> into coup injuries (where the occiput is the area of impact), countercoup injuries (where the frontal or temporal area is targeted), and acceleration-deceleration injuries [4].|$|R
5000|$|In {{the heat}} of a game, it may be hard to see or feel {{symptoms}} relating to cerebral <b>contusions.</b> If any of these signs are visible or as an athlete, you feel them, remove yourself from competition immediately. Cerebral <b>contusions</b> and other injuries can occur in any sport, not just in the traditional “collision” sports. According to the USCPSC, four of the top five sports that cause brain injuries are considered to have limited brain contact: basketball, bicycling, baseball, and playground activities. [...] The most popular sport to cause cerebral <b>contusions</b> is American football due to the drastic acceleration/deceleration of the brain.|$|R
50|$|<b>Contusions</b> {{are likely}} to heal on their own without medical intervention.|$|R
5|$|Hill was {{qualifying}} for a 1997 event at Sonoma when his car suffered severe vibration {{as he crossed}} the finish line. The car went out of control and was completely destroyed. Hill had two broken toes and a shoulder <b>contusion,</b> which were not serious injuries. The run had been fast enough to make Hill the fastest qualifier, and Hill wanted to race his backup car in the first round on the day after the accident. The NHRA had a rule that the car used for qualifying had {{to be used in the}} event, so the sanctioning body did not allow him to compete. The rule was changed after the event to allow racers to race on race day even if they do not use the same car.|$|E
5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for marine mammals. This {{is a problem}} because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and <b>contusion</b> and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E
5|$|On July 24, 2015, the Braves traded Uribe and Kelly Johnson to the New York Mets for John Gant and Rob Whalen. During {{his second}} game with New York, Uribe hit the walk-off {{single in the}} tenth inning {{to win the game}} for the Mets, 3–2 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Uribe missed the National League Division Series and National League Championship Series due to a chest <b>contusion</b> in September, but was added to the Mets' World Series roster and came off the bench in the sixth inning of Game 3 to deliver a pinch-hit single, driving in a run.|$|E

30|$|<b>Contusions</b> {{are defined}} as any injury to the body {{occurring}} following trauma that leads to blood vessel rupture and tissue destruction. Following <b>contusions,</b> the area is marked by active bleeding into the tissue [1]. This traumatic brain injury (TBI) is {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality worldwide and affects up to 10 million individuals annually [2].|$|R
40|$|Cerebral <b>contusions</b> {{are one of}} the {{principal}} lesions of traumatic brain injury and the attendant oedema formation contributes substantially to the clinicopathological manifestations. While it is now recognised that the membrane channel protein aquaporin- 4 (AQP- 4) {{plays a major role in}} the development and resolution of cerebral oedema, assessments of its expression in and around <b>contusions</b> have produced conflicting results. We used an ovine impact-acceleration model of closed head injury to examine contusion-related AQP- 4 expression and found that there was a heterogeneous AQP- 4 response within <b>contusions,</b> with some astrocytes being nonviable and immunonegative, while others showed increased AQP- 4 expression. Pericontusional astrocytes in the penumbra region generally showed more robust AQP- 4 immunopositivity than intracontusional glia. Thus, manipulation of AQP- 4 expression could have therapeutic applications in controlling cerebral oedema associated with <b>contusions.</b> John W. Finnie, Peter C. Blumbergs and Jim Manavi...|$|R
5|$|On June 9, 2016, Hughes {{was struck}} in the left knee off a line drive from J. T. Realmuto and left the game. The next day, he {{was placed on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list due to left knee <b>contusion.</b> He was ruled out for 6-8 weeks. On June 11, it was revealed that there was a non-displaced fracture of the femur in the left knee. On June 12, he was transferred to the 60-day disabled list. On June 28th, Hughes' season was declared over as he was set to undergo season ending surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome. He finished the 2016 season with a 1-7 record for the Twins.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Uribe {{signed with}} the Giants and was again used as utility player. He spent most of 2010 as the Giants' shortstop, hit a career-high 24 home runs, and had several key hits in the playoffs as the Giants won the 2010 World Series. Following that season, he signed a three-year {{contract}} with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The next two years were plagued by injuries and poor hitting, but he regained his starting role at third base and made strong contributions to the team in 2013 and 2014. Uribe {{was traded to the}} Braves in late May of the 2015 season and again to the Mets in July of the 2015 season. Before the start of spring training in 2016, he signed a one-year contract with the Cleveland Indians. He was injured by a ground ball on June 12, 2016 and was later diagnosed with a testicular <b>contusion.</b> The Indians designated him for assignment on August 1 and released him on August 5.|$|E
5|$|In February, the 76ers had Okafor and Nerlens Noel swap {{positions}} as Okafor moved from center to power forward. On February 6, he recorded 22 points and a season-high 17 rebounds in a 103–98 {{win over the}} Brooklyn Nets. The position swap was considered an improvement over the two players splitting time or having Noel play out of his natural position. On February 21 against the Dallas Mavericks, Okafor posted a career-high 31 points in a 129–103 loss, surpassing not only his NBA career high, but also his 30-point game at Duke. On February 28, Okafor posted 26 points against the Orlando Magic, but he endured a shin <b>contusion</b> in a collision with teammate Isaiah Canaan that was only expected to sideline him for a game. As he missed his fifth consecutive game, 76ers head coach Brett Brown noted that Okafor had a CT scan on his knee. On March 11, Okafor was ruled out {{for the rest of}} the season after tests revealed that he had sustained a small tear of the meniscus in his right knee.|$|E
40|$|The Booklet Category Test (BCT) is a modified, highly {{portable}} {{version of}} the Halstead Category Test that {{has been shown to}} be very sensitive to brain damage. The BCT is commonly used in neuropsychological assessment in Western countries, however, no information on psychometric properties of the BCT had been report in the Chinese population thus far. This is a single-center, hospital-based, prospective, case-controlled cognitive instrument validation study. The study objective is to examine the criterion, convergent and divergent validity, test-retest reliability, internal consistency and ease of administration of the BCT in Chinese. Ten healthy controls, 12 patients with focal frontal <b>contusions</b> and ten patients with non-frontal <b>contusions</b> were recruited. The Chinese BCT did not differentiate between patients with cerebral <b>contusions</b> from controls, or between patients with focal frontal <b>contusions</b> from those with non-frontal <b>contusions</b> using receiver operating curve analyses. However, it showed good convergent validity with tests of spatial reasoning and had acceptable divergent validity, excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s ss=. 928) and test-retest reliability (ICC =. 982, p <. 982) and was generally well accepted by local participants. These results showed that the BCT is a valid and reliable clinical measure of spatial reasoning applicable to the Chinese population. published_or_final_versionClinical PsychologyMasterMaster of Social Science...|$|R

5|$|Against the Baltimore Ravens in {{the preseason}} opener on August 11, Kafka {{replaced}} Young at quarterback during the second quarter and played into the fourth quarter. He went 13-of-19 for 132yards with one interception thrown to Ravens safety Bernard Pollard in the game. In {{the second week of}} the preseason on August 18 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Kafka entered the game in the fourth quarter and led the Eagles to two scoring drives in a 24–14 loss. With less than four minutes remaining in the game, he threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Gerald Jones, and with only 19 seconds left on the following drive, threw a second touchdown pass to Jones for sevenyards. He finished the game going 14-for-19 for 160yards along with the two scores. Kafka played in garbage time in the next preseason game against the Cleveland Browns, handing the ball off twice and kneeling down twice. Against the New York Jets {{in the preseason}} finale, he filled in for the injured Young, who started the game, to start the third quarter. Kafka had the wind knocked out of him on a sack, but was able to play the rest of the game despite a rib <b>contusion.</b> He finished the game 7-for-11 for 76yards and one interception. He went 34-for-49 for 369yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the preseason overall.|$|E
