500|$|The defence called Brownlee, who recounted {{his version}} of events. [...] He testified {{that he had been}} {{otherwise}} occupied on many of the days that he and MacMillan had supposedly had sex; in one case, he produced newspaper stories showing that he had been making a speech in Stettler at a time that MacMillan had claimed he was forcing himself upon her in Edmonton. [...] In another, he testified that he was meeting with O. H. Snow, the mayor of Raymond. [...] MacLean on cross-examination tried to paint Brownlee as a man of tremendous persuasive powers, recalling his time as a lawyer in Calgary, only to have Brownlee retort that he had only ever tried two cases, spending most of his time drafting <b>commercial</b> <b>documents.</b> [...] MacLean also emphasized the $1,400 that Lymburn as Attorney General had spent investigating the case, suggesting that this amounted to government funds being spent to vindicate Brownlee personally; outside of the courtroom, Lymburn responded that his office had received a complaint that an [...] "Edmonton lawyer"—taken by all involved to be MacLean—had approached a young woman offering money to place Brownlee in a compromising position, and that, as a criminal allegation, it had been the obligation of his office to investigate. [...] He further emphasized that, against his protestations, Brownlee had insisted on reimbursing the government for the full cost of the investigation.|$|E

50|$|Franco {{also used}} {{language}} politics {{in an attempt}} to establish national homogeneity. He promoted the use of Castilian Spanish and suppressed other languages such as Catalan, Galician, and Basque. The legal usage of languages other than Castilian was forbidden. All government, notarial, legal and <b>commercial</b> <b>documents</b> were to be drawn up exclusively in Castilian and any documents written in other languages were deemed null and void. The usage of any other language was forbidden in schools, in advertising, and on road and shop signs. For unofficial use, citizens continued to speak these languages. This was the situation throughout the 1940s {{and to a lesser extent}} during the 1950s, but after 1960 the non-Castilian Spanish languages were freely spoken and written, and they reached bookshops and stages, although they never received official status.|$|E

50|$|Franco {{also used}} {{language}} politics {{in an attempt}} to establish national homogeneity. Despite Franco himself being Galician, the government revoked the official statute and recognition for the Basque, Galician, and Catalan languages that the Second Spanish Republic had granted {{them for the first time}} in the history of Spain. The former policy of promoting Spanish as the only official language of the State and education was resumed, even though millions of the country's citizens spoke other languages. The legal usage of languages other than Spanish was forbidden: all government, notarial, legal and <b>commercial</b> <b>documents</b> were to be drawn up exclusively in Spanish, and any written in other languages were deemed null and void. The use of any other language was forbidden in schools, advertising, religious ceremonies and on road and shop signs. Publications in other languages were generally forbidden, though citizens continued to use them privately.|$|E
50|$|Some {{years after}} this earlier form of stamp duty had been abolished, the Ottoman {{treasury}} invented a replacement; {{a series of}} preprinted blank papers with official treasury stamps, {{which had to be}} used for almost all official legal and <b>commercial</b> <b>documents</b> (apart from some issued by religious courts). The papers could only be purchased for a considerable fee; a graduated scale of different fees was published, so that a small commercial contract might use a low-value paper, and a high-value contract must use a more expensive paper. This is similar to the stamp duty process adopted in some western European countries. Early revenue from the revised form of damga resmi was modest; perhaps 10-20 million akçes per year in the late 19th century, but this swelled to over 50 million akçes in 1912 - more than court charges or the muskirat resmi (spirit tax), but still dwarfed by the salt tax (tuz resmi).|$|E
5000|$|Proto-Shtokavian, or Church Slavic with {{ingredients}} of nascent Shtokavian, {{were recorded in}} legal documents like the charter of Ban Kulin, regulating the commerce between Bosnia and Dubrovnik in Croatia, dated 1189, and in liturgical texts like Gršković’s and Mihanović’s fragments, ca. 1150, in southern Bosnia or Herzegovina. Experts' opinions are divided {{with regard to the}} extent these texts, especially the Kulin ban parchment, contain contemporary Shtokavian vernacular. Mainly Shtokavian, with {{ingredients of}} Church Slavic, are numerous legal and <b>commercial</b> <b>documents</b> from pre-Ottoman Bosnia, Hum, Serbia, Zeta, and southern Dalmatia, especially Dubrovnik. The first comprehensive vernacular Shtokavian text is the Vatican Croatian Prayer Book, written in Dubrovnik a decade or two before 1400. In the next two centuries Shtokavian vernacular texts had been written mainly in Dubrovnik, other Adriatic cities and islands influenced by Dubrovnik, as well as in Bosnia, by Bosnian Franciscans and Bosniak Muslim vernacular alhamiado literature - the first example being [...] "Chirwat turkisi" [...] or [...] "Croatian song", dated 1589.|$|E
