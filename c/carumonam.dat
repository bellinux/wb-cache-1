40|$|The {{in vitro}} and in vivo {{antibacterial}} activities of <b>carumonam</b> (AMA- 1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, {{were compared with}} those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. <b>Carumonam</b> was highly active in vitro against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against Staphylococcus aureus. The MICs of <b>carumonam</b> for 90 % of 1, 156 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0. 013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest MICs of the antibiotics tested. The MIC of <b>carumonam</b> for 90 % of Klebsiella oxytoca was 0. 2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. The superiority of <b>carumonam</b> to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The MIC of <b>carumonam</b> for 90 % of P. aeruginosa was 12. 5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime. <b>Carumonam</b> showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of S. aureus and Bacteroides fragilis. <b>Carumonam</b> was resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal beta-lactamases. It was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of K. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of <b>carumonam</b> to those of aztreonam against this species. In general, the protective activities (50 % effective dose) of <b>carumonam</b> and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (MIC); <b>carumonam</b> showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of <b>carumonam</b> and eight comparative antimicrobial agents were studied. MICs of <b>carumonam</b> {{were less than}} or equal to 0. 5 microgram/ml for 91 % of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and {{less than or equal}} to 16 micrograms/ml for 88 % of nonfermenters; gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria were resistant. Combinations of <b>carumonam</b> with piperacillin, nafcillin, or clindamycin were usually indifferent, although synergy between <b>carumonam</b> and piperacillin was observed with 20 (13 %) of 155 strains...|$|E
40|$|<b>Carumonam</b> and {{gentamicin}} {{were compared}} in a prospective, randomized study of 52 patients with complicated urinary tract infections. Patients {{were treated with}} either <b>carumonam</b> (1 g every 8 h) or gentamicin (1 mg/kg every 8 h). The mean duration of therapy (<b>carumonam,</b> 8. 5 days; gentamicin, 8. 5 days) was similar for both groups. A total of 45 % of patients treated with <b>carumonam</b> and 48 % of those receiving gentamicin were cured, as defined by a negative culture 1 to 2 weeks after therapy. After 4 to 6 weeks, the figures were 27 % for <b>carumonam</b> and 38 % for gentamicin. In the <b>carumonam</b> group, there were 6 relapses and 11 reinfections. In the gentamicin group, there were eight relapses and five reinfections. Adverse effects in the <b>carumonam</b> group were limited to phlebitis at the intravenous infusion site in two patients; another patient developed bloody diarrhea. Nephrotoxicity was documented in two patients in the gentamicin treatment group (9 %), and another patient developed minor liver function disturbances. Three patients with gentamicin-resistant carumonam-susceptible isolates were treated with <b>carumonam,</b> and two were cured. Urinary colonization with group D streptococci occurred in 7 of 27 (26 %) carumonam-treated patients compared with 7 of 19 (37 %) gentamicin-treated patients; no one required treatment. A significant correlation was found between colonization with group D streptococci and neurogenic bladder dysfunction (P less than 0. 007). It is concluded {{that the use of}} the <b>carumonam</b> is as effective as the gentamicin regimen in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{properties of}} <b>carumonam</b> (AMA- 1080, Ro 17 - 2301) were studied in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys and {{compared with those}} of aztreonam. <b>Carumonam</b> administered subcutaneously in mice or intramuscularly in rats, rabbits, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys at a dose of 20 mg/kg was readily absorbed and distributed at high concentrations in the plasma, kidneys, liver, and lungs, as was aztreonam. The peak level of <b>carumonam</b> in plasma, ranging from 41 micrograms/ml in mice to 68 micrograms/ml in monkeys; the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, ranging from 20 micrograms X h/ml in mice to 80 micrograms X h/ml in monkeys; the plasma half-life, ranging from 0. 24 h in mice to 1. 10 h in dogs; and the plasma clearance, ranging from 4. 5 ml/min per kg in monkeys to 16. 7 ml/min per kg in mice, resembled respective values of aztreonam. In rats, <b>carumonam</b> was eliminated faster than aztreonam. The levels of both antibiotics in the kidneys and liver were usually higher than respective levels in plasma. The level of <b>carumonam</b> in the kidney was usually higher than that of aztreonam, whereas the level of aztreonam in the liver was usually higher than that of <b>carumonam.</b> Both antibiotics showed similar distribution in the lung and spleen; the levels in these tissues were less than the levels in plasma. <b>Carumonam</b> was excreted mainly in the urine; the recovery ranged from 52 % (from dogs) to 73 % (from rabbits). The urinary recovery of <b>carumonam</b> from mice, rats, and monkeys was higher, but the recovery of <b>carumonam</b> from rabbits and dogs was lower than that of aztreonam. The biliary excretion of <b>carumonam,</b> amounting to 4. 1 % from rats and less than 0. 3 % from rabbits and dogs, was smaller than that of aztreonam, amounting to 19. 1 % from rats and around 1 % from rabbits and dogs. The extent of protein binding at 20 micrograms of <b>carumonam</b> per ml was lower than that of aztreonam. For all species except dogs, which have very low binding in their serum (11 % for <b>carumonam</b> and 20 % for aztreonam), the binding of <b>carumonam</b> ranged from 21 % (in rabbits) to 36 % (in rats), whereas that of aztreonam ranged from 55 % (in rabbits) to 85 % (in rats). Thus, the plasma pharmacokinetics of <b>carumonam</b> and aztreonam were generally similar for all animals tested except dogs, but the two antibiotics differed slightly in their distribution in tissue, excretion, and protein binding in serum...|$|E
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} <b>carumonam</b> (formerly RO- 17 - 2301), a monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic, was {{compared with those}} of aztreonam, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and gentamicin against 455 bacterial isolates. <b>Carumonam</b> did not possess activity against gram-positive cocci and was generally comparable to aztreonam and ceftazidime for most gram-negative bacilli. However, <b>carumonam</b> was the most active beta-lactam against gentamicin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (90 % MIC, 8 micrograms/ml) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{penetration}} of <b>carumonam</b> into the pleural exudate of rats was compared after intravenous administration of 30 mg kg(- 1) {{of the drug}} as a bolus dose or by continuous infusion over 60 min. Both methods of administration ensured a good {{penetration of}} <b>carumonam</b> in pleural exudate, {{as measured by the}} areas under the concentration-time curves (AUC). The mean values of the ratio of AUC in exudate to AUC in serum (1. 07 +/- 0. 11 and 0. 96 +/- 0. 13 for bolus injection and continuous infusion, respectively) were not significantly different. Administration as a bolus dose resulted in significantly higher peak concentrations in pleural exudate as well as in shorter peak times, whereas continuous infusion produced <b>carumonam</b> levels above the MIC for consistently longer times. The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained by analysis of serum <b>carumonam</b> concentrations proved to be independent of the mode of administration. The foregoing results suggest that <b>carumonam</b> may constitute an effective therapeutic alternative to existing antibiotics for the treatment of pleurisy caused by susceptible organisms. No clear superiority of either method of administration could be established on the basis of pharmacokinetic data...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>carumonam</b> after {{single and}} multiple intravenous administration of 1 - and 2 -g dosage regimens were studied in 12 young male volunteers. Plasma and urine {{samples were collected}} in serial order for 24 h and assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The mean elimination half-life of <b>carumonam</b> was not significantly affected by either dosage regimen or single dose versus steady state, ranging from 1. 3 to 1. 5 h. Mean concentrations {{at the end of}} the interval were not influenced by a multiple-dose administration. The normalized volume of distribution was independent of the dose, with values ranging from 0. 16 to 0. 19 liters/kg. After multiple administration, <b>carumonam</b> was cleared from the body more rapidly: from 96. 2 to 121. 7 ml/min after 1 g every 8 h, and from 102. 1 to 122. 3 ml/min after 2 g every 8 h (P less than 0. 05). After 24 h, 75. 0 to 80. 7 % of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. The protein binding of <b>carumonam</b> to human plasma remained stable at 28 %. <b>Carumonam</b> was well tolerated by the volunteers...|$|E
40|$|<b>Carumonam</b> {{is a new}} monobactam {{antibiotic}} with potent activity against gram-negative aerobes. To {{study the}} efficacy and safety of <b>carumonam</b> for treatment of complicated and uncomplicated urinary tract infections, 54 patients were randomized to therapy with either <b>carumonam</b> or ceftazidime. Of 42 patients who could be evaluated, 82 % of the carumonam-treated patients and 80 % of the ceftazidime-treated patients were cured clinically. At 5 to 9 days posttherapy, microbiologic criteria indicated that 13 carumonam-treated patients (48 %) and 8 ceftazidime-treated patients (53 %) were cured. Patients with indwelling bladder catheters {{at the end of}} therapy had a markedly worse microbiologic outcome than those without catheters. Enterococcus sp. reinfection was common in both groups. Possible adverse clinical and laboratory reactions occurred in six carumonam-treated patients (21 %) and four ceftazidime-treated patients (27 %). Most reactions occurred at the end of therapy and resolved with discontinuation of the study drug. In this small study, <b>carumonam</b> appeared as safe and as effective as ceftazidime for the treatment of complicated and uncomplicated urinary tract infections...|$|E
40|$|Steady-state {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>carumonam</b> {{were investigated}} in twelve healthy adult male volunteers after 20 min intravenous infusions of three consecutive <b>carumonam</b> dosage regimens: 1 g every 8 h (3 g/day) from 0 - 72 h, 2 g every 8 h (6 g/day) from 88 - 120 h and 2 g every 6 h (8 g/day) from 132 - 216 h. Serial plasma {{samples were collected}} after the first dose of the first regimen and the last dose of all three regimens and were analysed for <b>carumonam</b> by a specific HPLC method. The overall mean maximal plasma concentrations were 108 and 211 mg/ 1 {{at the end of}} infusion of 1 and 2 g, respectively. The steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters and plasma concentration-time profiles of <b>carumonam</b> when adjusted for dose were similar for the three regimens. The overall terminal elimination half-life was 1 - 4 h (range 1 - 1 — 1 - 8 h), the apparent volume of distribution at steady state reached 11 - 51 (range 8 - 7 - 15 - 51) and the total systemic clearance amounted to 118 ml/min (range 83 - 158 ml/min). Considering the frequency of dosing relative to the elimination half-life, accumulation of the drug in plasma was not expected and none was found from any of the three regimens. <b>Carumonam</b> was well tolerated up to 8 g/day and exhibited dose-independent pharmacokinetics which were not altered upon multiple dosing...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavioural}} and electrocortical {{effects of}} two monobactam derivatives were studied after intraperitoneal (ip) administration in DBA/ 2 mice, a strain genetically susceptible to sound-induced seizures, and in C 57 and Swiss mice, two strains not prone to seizure. DBA/ 2 mice were more susceptible than Swiss and C 57 mice to seizures induced by aztreonam or <b>carumonam.</b> No {{significant differences were}} observed between seizures elicited by aztreonam and <b>carumonam</b> in animals (DBA/ 2 only) administered intracerebroventricularly or ip. Although the main mechanism for seizure-like activity of monobactams cannot be easily determined, we believe that several mechanisms may be involved. An increased excitation of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) by inhibition of GABA binding to receptors and a slow clearance of aztreonam and <b>carumonam</b> from the CNS may be postulated...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>carumonam</b> after {{a single}} 1, 000 -mg intravenous infusion (20 min) were evaluated in four groups of subjects who had {{various degrees of}} renal impairment: group 1, CLCR greater than 60 ml/min; group 2, CLCR = 30 to 60 ml/min; group 3, CLCR = 10 to 30 ml/min; and group 4, CLCR less than 10 ml/min). The elimination half-life of <b>carumonam</b> increased with decreasing creatinine clearance (CLCR) from 1. 7 h in group 1 to 11. 3 h in group 4. Peak <b>carumonam</b> concentration (103 micrograms/ml) and steady-state volume of distribution (12. 8 liters) did not change with decreasing CLCR. Total body clearance (r = 0. 98), renal clearance (r = 0. 98), and nonrenal clearance (r = 0. 67) of <b>carumonam</b> correlated with decreasing CLCR. Mean nonrenal clearance was 21 ml/min in group 1 and 12 ml/min in group 4. With regard to dosage, patients with a CLCR above 60 ml/min should receive their standard maintenance dose of <b>carumonam</b> without any changes; patients with a CLCR between 30 and 60 ml/min should receive the dose every 12 h; and individuals with a CLCR between 10 and 30 ml/min {{should be given the}} dose once a day. Patients with a CLCR of less than 10 ml/min should receive one-half of the dose once a day.

40|$|Escherichia coli O 111 reacts only {{slightly}} with antiserum to its rough mutant E. coli J 5 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. When E. coli O 111 was {{grown in the}} presence of sub-MICs of the monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic <b>carumonam,</b> however, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer increased from 1, 280 to 81, 920. When the bacteria were grown {{in the presence of}} <b>carumonam,</b> the titer that was obtained with antiserum against E. coli O 111 was not affected. This reaction was abolished after this antiserum was absorbed with E. coli J 5 {{in the case of the}} carumonam-treated strain, whereas this absorption did not affect the reaction with E. coli O 111. Thus, the O-antigenic side chain of E. coli O 111 seems to be affected if this strain is cultured in the presence of <b>carumonam.</b> Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a relative loss of the O polysaccharide in E. coli O 111 when this strain was grown in the presence of <b>carumonam.</b> Also, a much stronger reaction of the antibiotic-affected lipopolysaccharide with a monoclonal antibody against E. coli J 5 lipopolysaccharide was shown in immunoblots.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>carumonam</b> (AMA- 1080) {{were studied}} after a single intravenous 1. 0 -g dose {{was given to}} 26 subjects grouped according to their renal functions. Creatinine clearance (CLCR) was above 85, 50 to 84, 10 to 49, and below 10 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. All of the six patients in group 4 were receiving maintenance hemodialysis, and they were studied both during and between hemodialysis sessions. <b>Carumonam</b> obeyed two-compartment model kinetics in all four groups. The volume of distribution based on the area under serum concentration-time curve (Varea) {{did not differ significantly}} among the four groups, the mean value being 0. 309 0. 084 liter/kg.

40|$|Rats {{and dogs}} {{were given a}} single 20 -mg/kg dose of [14 C]carumonam intramuscularly or intravenously. In rats, the level in plasma of [14 C]carumonam {{administered}} intramuscularly peaked (29. 1 micrograms/ml) 15 min after dosing and then declined with an apparent elimination half-life of 16. 2 min. Intramuscular injection of [14 C]carumonam to dogs gave a peak level (36. 8 micrograms/ml) in plasma at 20 min and an apparent elimination half-life of 51. 7 min. After administration of the intravenous dose, apparent elimination half-lives were 13. 1 and 52. 7 min in rats and dogs, respectively. In both animals, the radioactivity in plasma was made up largely (greater than 80 %) of unchanged <b>carumonam,</b> which was protein bound to only a small extent. In rats given [14 C]carumonam intramuscularly, radioactivity was distributed widely in tissues, with relatively high concentrations in the kidney and liver. The radioactivity concentration in the rat fetus was relatively low, as was that in milk. In both rats and dogs <b>carumonam</b> did not undergo extensive metabolism; the most prominent metabolite was AMA- 1294, the compound resulting from beta-lactam ring hydrolysis. [14 C]carumonam and metabolites were mostly eliminated from the bodies within 72 h in rats and 120 h in dogs. In both animals, {{a large amount of}} the dosed radioactivity was excreted in the urine largely as unchanged antibiotic. The remainder was eliminated in the feces via bile. AMA- 1294 was eliminated from the bodies of rats and dogs at a considerably slower rate than was unchanged <b>carumonam.</b> In rats, [14 C]carumonam was eliminated by both glomerular filtration (67 %) and tubular secretion (33 %); the renal elimination of [14 C]AMA- 1294 was only by glomerular filtration...|$|E

40|$|Seven extended-spectrum beta-lactamases {{related to}} TEM and four enzymes derived from SHV- 1 were {{transferred}} to a common Escherichia coli host so that the activity {{of a variety of}} beta-lactams could be tested in a uniform genetic environment. For most derivatives, penicillinase activity was 10 % or less than that of strains making TEM- 1, TEM- 2, or SHV- 1 beta-lactamase, suggesting that reduced catalytic efficiency accompanied the broader substrate spectrum. Despite this deficit, resistance to aztreonam, <b>carumonam,</b> cefdinir, cefepime, cefixime, cefmenoxime, cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefpirome, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, ceftibuten, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, and E 1040 was enhanced. For strains producing TEM-type enzymes, however, MICs of <b>carumonam,</b> cefepime, cefmenoxime, cefotiam, cefpirome, and ceftibuten were 8 micrograms/ml or less. Susceptibilities of cefmetazole, cefotetan, cefoxitin, flomoxef, imipenem, meropenem, moxalactam, temocillin, FCE 22101, and Sch 34343 were unaffected. FCE 22101, imipenem, meropenem, and Sch 34343 were inhibitory for all strains at 1 microgram/ml or less. In E. coli an OmpF- porin mutation in combination with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase enhanced resistance to many of these agents, but generally by only fourfold. Hyperproduction of chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase increased resistance to 7 -alpha-methoxy beta-lactams but not that to temocillin. When tested at 8 micrograms/ml, clavulanate was more potent than sulbactam or tazobactam in overcoming resistance to ampicillin, while cefoperazone-sulbactam was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanate or piperacillin-tazobactam, especially against TEM-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to identify newer antimicrobial agents that may be useful in the therapy of melioidosis. The in vitro susceptibilities of 199 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas pseudomallei to 22 antibiotics were determined by standard disk diffusion, and those to 13 antibiotics were determined by agar dilution. Over 90 % of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, piperacillin, ceftazidime, ticarcillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, and <b>carumonam</b> by both methods. Standard disk diffusion yielded unacceptably high false-susceptibility results with aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and temafloxacin. Piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin were not bactericidal for three selected P. pseudomallei strains as determined by time-kill curve methods. Furthermore, addition of ciprofloxacin to piperacillin, ceftazidime, or imipenem did not enhance bactericidal activity. One hundred ninety-four strains showed weak beta-lactamase production that did not increase upon incubation with cefoxitin. These findings suggest that several newer antimicrobial agents may prove useful in the treatment of melioidosis. However, results of susceptibility studies involving P. pseudomallei and newer agents must be interpreted with caution...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the renal excretion of <b>carumonam</b> (CRMN) was investigated in rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys. Stop-flow analysis in dogs demonstrated that CRMN is exclusively excreted by glomerular filtration. There was no specific CRMN peak corresponding to the peak of p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) secretion or to the trough of Na+-K+ reabsorption in the stop-flow pattern. Although the PAH peak disappeared when probenecid was administered, the CRMN stop-flow pattern showed no change. In rabbits, however, the CRMN concentration peak corresponding with the PAH peak was detected in the stop-flow pattern; the CRMN peak disappeared when probenecid was administered. The pharmacokinetic parameters in plasma, such as the area under the concentration-time curve, the half-life, and the clearance rate, were affected by probenecid in rats, rabbits, and monkeys, but not in dogs. The {{results suggest that the}} renal excretion of CRMN in dogs takes place exclusively through glomerular filtration. In rats, rabbits, and monkeys, however, CRMN is excreted through both glomerular filtration and renal tubular secretion...|$|E
40|$|Limited b-lactams show antipseudomonal activity. The rapid {{spread of}} IMP-type metallo-b-lactamases (MBLs), {{which have a}} broad {{spectrum}} of substrates and a poor susceptibility to clinically available inhibitors, further restricts b-lactam use. In the present study, we evaluated the potency of IMP- 10 MBL in hydrolysing antipseudomonal b-lactams currently available in the clinic. Crude IMP- 10 MBL was prepared from two clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa harbouring the blaIMP- 10 gene. The sensitivity of b-lactams to hydrolysis by IMP- 10 MBL was determined by comparing the MICs of 14 antipseudomonal b-lactams against a susceptible strain of P. aeruginosa in the presence and absence of IMP- 10 MBL. Carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem and panipenem) and extended-spectrum cephems (ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefsulodin and cefepime) were sensitive to the hydrolysing activity of IMP- 10 MBL. By comparison, the fourth-generation cephem (cefpirome), the extended-spectrum penicillins (carbenicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin and mezlocillin) and monobactams (aztreonam and <b>carumonam)</b> were relatively resistant to IMP- 10 MBL. The sensitivity profile of antipseudomonal b-lactams to IMP- 10 MBL generated in the present study provides a valuable reference for antibiotic selection by medical professionals...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} five new beta-lactams to {{permeate}} the outer membrane of intact Enterobacter cloacae beta-lactamase-overproducing cells {{was measured by}} using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) -based technique that avoided certain possible artifacts of the traditional methods. Low concentrations of antibiotics were mixed with bacterial suspensions, and at different times, the cells {{were removed from the}} medium by filtration. Residual beta-lactam concentrations in the medium were then assessed by HPLC and UV detection. The assay was performed under conditions in which no beta-lactamase activity was detected in the filtrate and the number of viable cells remained constant during the experiment. Outer membrane permeability was assessed with the Zimmermann-Rosselet equation, in which outer membrane permeability was rate limiting for hydrolysis of the beta-lactam by periplasmic beta-lactamase. Thus, the rate of disappearance of beta-lactam was equal to the rate of outer membrane permeation. Preincubation of bacterial suspensions with 300 micrograms of cloxacillin per ml inhibited the hydrolysis of beta-lactams by intact cells, demonstrating that beta-lactam hydrolysis by periplasmic beta-lactamase was essential in order to allow measurement of outer membrane permeability by this method. Permeability coefficients (P) were calculated from the Zimmermann-Rosselet equation and were independent of the external concentration of antibiotic over a 100 -fold concentration range. Cefepime and cefpirome exhibited rates of outer membrane permeation 5 - to 20 -fold higher than those of <b>carumonam,</b> ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime. Thus, the presence of a positive charge in the 3 -lateral chain increased the permeation ability of beta-lactam molecules considerably...|$|E
40|$|B 0 - 1165 is a 1 -carboxy- 1 -cyclopropoxyamino, 4 -fluoromethyl monobactam. It {{inhibited}} {{the majority}} of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella and Shigella species at {{less than or equal}} to 0. 125 microgram/ml. Overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the MICs for individual isolates. Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime had MICs that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. B 0 - 1165 had activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and <b>carumonam.</b> Pseudomonas maltophilia and other Pseudomonas species were resistant or had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, as did Acinetobacter species. B 0 - 1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as Clostridium and Bacteroides species. B 0 - 1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally Richmond-Sykes type 1 a-, 1 c-, and 1 d-mediated beta-lactamases. It inhibited the Enterobacter cloacae P 99 and inducible Pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. B 0 - 1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing E. cloacae and C. freundii to B 0 - 1165 selected for resistant isolates. Overall, B 0 - 1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of other monobactams currently available or under investigation...|$|E
40|$|Mechanisms of {{ceftriaxone}} resistance {{were examined}} in Enterobacter cloacae. Clones were selected from four strains: susceptible (S), resistant (R 1), selected by plating on ceftriaxone-containing agar, and highly resistant (R 2), selected in ceftriaxone-treated mice infected with S clones. According to 14 C-labeled beta-lactam binding assays, ceftriaxone resistance {{was not associated with}} altered target proteins. R 1 and R 2 clones stably produced 50 to 1, 500 times more beta-lactamase than S clones; this production increased after cefoxitin induction in all S and some R 1 clones. Experiments conducted with strain 218 suggested that ceftriaxone resistance involved beta-lactamase hydrolysis. Half-lives for the beta-lactamase-beta-lactam complexes at 37 degrees C were 0. 4 and 2. 2 min for ceftriaxone and Sch 34343, a drug not affected by the resistance, respectively; in chromatography experiments, 218 intact R 1 cells (2 x 10 (9) to 3 x 10 (9) CFU) suspended in ceftriaxone-containing buffer (2 micrograms/ml) hydrolyzed 80 % of the antibiotic in 30 min. Three observations also suggested decreased permeability in some clones, (i) Most of the R 1 and R 2 clones showed decreased expression of outer membrane proteins of 37, 000 to 38, 000 molecular weight (37 K to 38 K proteins) by electrophoresis, often associated with increased amounts of 42 K protein. (ii) [14 C]Sch 34343 labeling of intact cells proceeded more slowly in 218 R 2 (with altered 37 K to 38 K proteins) than in 218 R 1 (without this alteration), a difference persisting after competition with unlabeled cloxacillin. Delays in binding were not caused by different enzymatic activities, since 218 R 1 and 218 R 2 produce, in similar amounts, beta-lactamases undistinguishable in isoelectric point and Km of cephaloridine. (iii) Intact cells from 218 R 2 hydrolyzed ceftriaxone more slowly (20 % in 30 min) than did those from 218 R 1. In 218 R 1, beta-lactamase overproduction was responsible for a 15 - to 200 -fold increase in the MIC's of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, carbenicillin, piperacillin, moxalactam, aztreonam, <b>carumonam,</b> and BMY 28142. Imipenem and Sch 34343 were not affected; an additional three- to fivefold increase in the MIC's of these antibiotics (with the exception of piperacillin, imipenem, Sch 34343), seen with 218 R 2, was associated with decreased permeability...|$|E
