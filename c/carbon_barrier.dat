The electron withdrawing power, {{and therefore the}} poisoning effect on potential CO adsorption, is maximal for subsurface C, but localized to immediately neighboring metal atoms. If the metal lattice is kept fixed, the barrier for moving the carbon atom between the two sites is high (4. 0 eV) because of steric repulsion. If the three-fold hollow of the cobalt cluster is stretched slightly by only 1 %, the barrier is reduced by nearly 50 %.

40|$|Chlorine is {{the most}} common {{disinfectant}} used in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. However, in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) in drinking-water sources,disinfection by-products (DBPs) are formed when chlorine is used to treat drinking water. The two largest groups of DBPs, trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), are frequently studied by researchers because of their toxicity and high levels in drinking water. In 1998 Newfoundland and Labrador began monitoring THMs and HAAs and it was found that several water utilities had THMs and HAAs above the specified Canadian guidelines, mostly in small, rural drinking-water systems. Pouch Cove was selected for this study as elevated levels of THMs and HAAs were found in their drinking-water system. This study focused on the development of a simple and affordable filtration technology. A passive <b>carbon</b> <b>barrier</b> was studied in the lab to remove NOM, commonly measured as total organic carbon (TOC), before chlorination. The <b>carbon</b> <b>barrier</b> was made from extracted unburned carbon from oil fly ash (OFA), which is abundant within Canada and abroad. The passive nature of this barrier makes it easy to operate and its extremely low cost makes the system affordable for small communities. The OFA samples used for this study were obtained from the Rabigh power plant in Saudi Arabia, which currently generates about 60 tons of OFA daily and currently being disposed into landfills. Since raw OFA contains organic and inorganic impurities, study samples were cleaned and treated through one of two processes, acid leaching or NaOH modification, followed by physical activation. Activated carbon (AC) samples were then applied to reduce the TOC and UV in the Pouch Cove drinking-water samples. In this adsorption treatment, a Split Plot design was employed to investigate the effects of different factors (pH, temperature, carbon dosage, sample volume, and contact/adsorption time), as well as the interaction effects among these factors. The results indicate that pH, temperature, carbon dosage, and sample volume are significant factors in designing a filtration technology. The optimal condition for TOC and UV reduction is a low temperature and a low pH. When the temperature is over 35 °C, or the pH is greater than 8, no reduction was observed. The overall TOC removal by activated OFA is relatively low; the maximum removal rate can reach 66...|$|E

40|$|Pulsed laser {{deposition}} (PLD) and magnetron {{sputter deposition}} (MSD) {{have been used}} to prepare different types of Mo/Si multilayers for the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectral range. In the case of PLD prepared Mo/Si multilayers the deposition of 0. 3 - 0. 5 nm thick <b>carbon</b> <b>barrier</b> layers at the interfaces leads to a substantial improvement of the interface quality. This can be deduced from Cu-Ká reflectivity measurements and HRTEM observations. Consequently the EUV reflectivity has been substantially increased. For pure Mo/Si-multilayers prepared by MSD the deposition parameters have been optimized so that a normal incidence reflectivity of REUV= 68. 7 % could be realized. Although {{this is one of the}} best experimental results achieved so far, there is still a gap between this experimental value and the theoretical limit (REUV= 75. 5 %). One of the main reasons for this discrepancy is the formation of intermixing zones at the interfaces. With B 4 C and C barrier layers at the interfaces interdiffus ion can be reduced. The resulting EUV reflectivity of this new type of EUV multilayers is 69. 8 % (ë= 13. 42 nm, á= 1. 5 °) and 71. 4 % (ë= 12. 52 nm, á= 22. 5 °) ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{molybdenum}} and silicon is the combination with the highest EUV reflectivity of two-component multilayers in the wavelength range ë = 12. 5 15 nm. Using the magnetron sputter deposition method multilayers with near normal incidence reflectance of typically 69 % can be prepared. A further increase to R = 70. 1 % at ë = 13. 3 nm was demonstrated by the introduction of tiny <b>carbon</b> <b>barrier</b> layers on the Mo-on-Si interfaces, which reduce the interdiffusion of both chemical elements. This is also connected with a higher thermal stability and lower internal stress of these multilayers as compared to pure Mo/Si multilayers. However, still higher reflectance are desirable {{for the use of the}} multilayers as reflectors for EUV lithography. From model considerations we have concluded that the replacement of the Mo absorber layer by a multi-component layer consisting of two or three layers could result in an EUV reflectivity increase of up to 0. 5 % compared to the pure Mo/Si system assuming sharp interfaces without any roughness. Particularly Ag and Ru are promising candidates as additional elements within the absorber. Therefore we have systematically changed the thickness of the individual layers under the boundary condition of a fixed period thickness of dp = (6. 90 ± 0. 05) nm. Microstructure and optical parameters of the multilayers have been investigated by HRTEM, X-ray diffractometry and Cu-Ká reflectomet ry.

40|$|Chlorine {{has been}} {{commonly}} used as disinfectant and oxidant in {{the drinking water}} supply systems due to its germicidal potency, efficiency, and low cost. Chlorination process not only removes odour, color, and certain metals, but also kills pathogens that usually grow in the pipelines. However, chlorine can react with natural organic matter (NOM) and produce compounds known as disinfection by-products (DBPs). Different water treatment processes have been applied to remove NOM before it reacts with chlorine to form DBPs. However, traditional water treatment methods showed limited capability in NOM removal. Activated carbon is identified as the best available technology and has been applied for NOM removal because of its high affinity to organic matters even at low concentrations. In this study, a column filtration technology utilizing activated carbon as a barrier was developed and applied {{in the treatment of}} source waters collected from three local communities. TOC, as a NOM indicator, is identified more reliable than UV since the UV reading can only reflect the amount of light-sensitive organic matters. Batch test results demonstrate the use of 0. 5 g (AC) /L (water) has the highest adsorption effectiveness and lowest cost of AC. Meanwhile, column filtration results indicate the activated <b>carbon</b> <b>barrier</b> is effective to remove 64, 77 and 74 percent of NOM from the source water of Sunnyside, New-Wes-Valley and Salvage, respectively. The follow-up chlorination experiment illustrates that the formation of THMs and HAAs can be considerably reduced after the water passed through the column. NOM fractionation of Sunnyside and New-Wes-Valley source water were also discovered; it is found the New-Wes-Valley source water contains higher amount of hydrophobic fraction which can result in the higher concentrations of THMs and HAAs in the disinfection process. This is proved in the chlorination experiments by assessing the formation potential of THMs and HAAs. The fractionation result can help to predict that the concentration of low molecular size NOM in New-Wes-Valley is higher than that in Sunnyside. Above all, the cost-effective carbon filtration technology developed in this study can be potentially applied as a pre-treatment technology for intake source waters for the local communities...|$|E

The first type is Schottky <b>barrier</b> <b>carbon</b> nanotube field effect transistor (SB-CNTFET) and second type is MOSFET-like CNTFETs (MOSCNTs). The MOSCNT was more favorable {{because of the high}} on–off current ratio, but leakage current (IL) of this transistor is very high because of electron band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) [4]. In order to deal with this problem, some solutions such as drain and source with a linearly or lightly doped, source and drain extensions and asymmetric oxide thickness, have been proposed [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Also, the dual material gate structure and the source and drain parameters effect on the characteristics of CNTFET are investigated [10, 11]. Moreover the p-type halo implanted deteriorates the cutoff frequency and the switching delay of CNTFET [12].|$|R
