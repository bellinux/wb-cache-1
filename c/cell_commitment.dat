5000|$|RhoA is {{required}} for processes involving cell development, some of which include outgrowth, dorsal closure, bone formation, and myogenesis. Loss of RhoA function is frequently attributed to failed gastrulation and cell migration inability. In extension, RhoA {{has been shown to}} function as an intermediary switch within the overall mechanically mediated process of stem <b>cell</b> <b>commitment</b> and differentiation.For example, human mesenchymal stem cells and their differentiation into adipocytes or osteocytes are direct results of RhoA’s impact on cell shape, signaling and cytoskeletal integrity. Cell shape acts as the primary mechanical cue that drives RhoA activity and downstream effector ROCK activity to control stem <b>cell</b> <b>commitment</b> and cytoskeletal maintenance.Transforming growth factor (TGF)-mediated pathways that control tumor progression and identity are also frequently noted to be RhoA-dependent mechanisms. TGF-β1, a tumor suppressive growth factor, is known to regulate growth, differentiation and epithelial transformation in tumorigenesis.

50|$|There {{are three}} thyroid hormone {{response}} elements (TREs) {{in the region}} upstream of the Sox2 promoter. This region {{is known as the}} enhancer region. Studies have suggested that thyroid hormone (T3) controls Sox2 expression via the enhancer region. The expression of TRα1 (thyroid hormone receptor) is increased in proliferating and migrating neural stem cells. It has therefore been suggested that transcriptional repression of Sox2, mediated by the thyroid hormone signaling axis, allows for neural stem <b>cell</b> <b>commitment</b> and migration from the sub-ventricular zone. A deficiency of thyroid hormone, particularly during the first trimester, will lead to abnormal central nervous system development.Further supporting this conclusion is the fact that hypothyroidism during fetal development can result in a variety of neurological deficiencies, including cretinism, characterized by stunted physical development and mental retardation.|$|E

Recently, we reported that retrovirus-delivered human arginine decarboxylase (hADC) genes improve cell survival against oxidative insult in murine NPCs in vitro. This study investigates whether the induced expression of hADC gene in mNPCs induces any significant change in the <b>cell</b> fate <b>commitment.</b> The evaluation of induced hADC gene function was assessed by knockdown of hADC gene using specific siRNA. The hADC gene delivery triggered higher expression of N-CAM, cell adhesion molecule and MAP- 2, neuronal marker. However, the hADC gene knockdown showed downregulation of N-CAM and MAP- 2 expression suggesting that hADC gene delivery favors <b>cell</b> fate <b>commitment</b> of mNPCs towards neuronal lineage. Neurite outgrowth was significantly longer in the hADC infected cells. The neurotrophic signal, BDNF aided in the neuronal commitment, differentiation, and maturation of hADC-mNPCs through PI 3 K and ERK 1 / 2 activation. The induction of neuron-like differentiation is believed to be regulated by the expression of GSK- 3 β and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that hADC gene delivery favors <b>cell</b> fate <b>commitment</b> of mNPCs towards neuronal lineage, bring new advances in the field of neurogenesis and cell therapy...|$|R

Researchers at the CIML also published the first nucleotide sequence of a gene encoding a human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene [...] and described how the TCR recognizes its MHC ligand. The functions of these T cells were also investigated, leading in particular to the identification of Granzyme A and GZMB (then called CTLA-1 and CTLA-3) and the demonstration of their playing a role in the perforin-granzyme-based mechanism of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and {{to the discovery of}} the second, Fas ligand/Fas receptor based pathway of cytotoxicity. Other biologically important regulatory molecules identified at the CIML include interleukins such as interleukin-17 (as CTLA-8) and cell surface molecules, such as CTLA-4 regulating T cells. Subsequently, research at the CIML expanded to other cells of the immune system, including B cells, dendritic cells and natural killer cells, as well as other models systems, such as C. elegans. CIML researchers identified the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-containing KARAP/DAP12 that is important for NK cell function and characterized the key function of the killer activated receptor NKp46. Other recent advances include the discovery of early precursors of B-cell follicular lymphoma in apparently healthy individuals, and of dendritic cell aggresome-like induced structures (DALIS) in dendritic cells, thought {{to play an important role}} in regulating antigen presentation, as well as the discovery of MafB/M-CSF circuits in hematopoietic stem <b>cell</b> <b>commitment,</b> and macrophages.|$|E
