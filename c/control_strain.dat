The incidence of adherence to HeLa cells was low both in pyelonephritogenic and faecal <b>control</b> <b>strains,</b> 6 and 7 % respectively (NS).

Chemical analyses showed the presence of serinocyclins, cyclic heptapeptides, in the extracts of conidia of <b>control</b> <b>strains,</b> whereas the compounds were undetectable in ΔManps 1 mutants treated identically or in other developmental stages, suggesting that MaNPS 1 encodes a serinocyclin synthetase.

50|$|In living organisms, {{the start}} codon that initiates protein {{synthesis}} codes for either methionine (eukaryotes) or formylmethionine (prokaryotes). In E. coli (prokaryote), an enzyme called formylmethionine deformylase can cleave the formyl group, leaving just the N-terminal methionine residue. For proteins with small, uncharged penultimate N-terminal residues, a methionine aminopeptidase can cleave the methionine residue.The number of genes encoding for a methionine aminopeptidase varies between organisms. In E. coli, {{there is only}} one known MetAP, a 29,333 Da monomeric enzyme coded for by a gene consisting of 264 codons. The knockout of this gene in E. coli leads to cell inviability. In humans, there are two genes encoding MetAP, MetAP1 and MetAP2. MetAP1 codes for a 42 kDa enzyme, while MetAP2 codes for a 67 kDa enzyme. Yeast MetAP1 is 40 percent homologous to E. coli MetAP; within S. cerevisiae, MetAP2 is 22 percent homologous with the sequence of MetAP1; MetAP2 is highly conserved between S. cerevisiae and humans. In contrast to prokaryotes, eukaryotic S. cerevisiae strains lacking the gene for either MetAP1 or MetAP2 are viable, but exhibit a slower growth rate than a <b>control</b> <b>strain</b> expressing both genes.|$|E

40|$|Molecular typing {{studies have}} shown that the {{predominant}} form of reproduction of Candida albicans is clonal and that, in a majority of situations, persistent or recurrent infections are due to a unique strain. Characterization of distinct subpopulations and correlation with clinical features may thus be important to understanding the pathogenesis of candidiasis. In a clonal model, a unique polymorphic marker may identify populations with different biological properties. We therefore compared 48 bloodstream isolates and 48 nonbloodstream matched strains of C. albicans at the elongation factor 3 -encoding gene (CEF 3) polymorphic microsatellite locus of C. albicans. Sizing of the alleles was performed by automated capillary electrophoresis. A new, 137 -bp allele was characterized, and seven nondescribed combinations were observed, resulting in 15 and 11 distinct CEF 3 profiles in bloodstream and <b>control</b> <b>strains,</b> respectively.

The lots of agar {{were used in}} three University of Washington hospitals from April 1975 through October 1977. The analyses indicated that the performance {{of members of the}} P. aeruginosa populations in each hospital closely followed the performance of the quality <b>control</b> <b>strain,</b> P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, when tested on each lot of Mueller-Hinton medium. The variability of zone diameters with the P. aeruginosa populations and the quality <b>control</b> <b>strain</b> indicated that a fixed indeterminate range (13 to 16 mm) of gentamicin susceptibility was not applicable to these organisms as it was with the Enterobacteriaceae. Variability in gentamicin susceptibility results was demonstrated in both minimal inhibitory concentration and disk diffusion tests when eight selected P. aeruginosa strains and the quality <b>control</b> <b>strain</b> were tested on each lot of medium. This variation in susceptibility to gentamicin was not related to the total Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, or Zn 2 + content of each lot of medium. The data demonstrated that a moving indeterminate range of gentamicin susceptibility, 3 to 6 mm below the mean zone diameter of the quality <b>control</b> <b>strain,</b> was a suitable criterion for strains tested on a single medium lot.

An animal model of compulsive-like behaviors has been developed through bidirectional selection of house mice (Mus musculus) for high (big cotton nests; BIG mice) and low levels (small nests; SMALL mice) of nest-building behavior. The BIG male strains have predictive and face validity as a spontaneous animal model of OCD. Here, we evaluated compulsive-, anxiety-, cognitive-, and depression-like behaviors among male and proestrus female replicate strains each of BIG (BIG 1, BIG 2) and SMALL (SML 1, SML 2) nest-builders, and randomly-bred Controls (C 1, C 2). BIG 1 and BIG 2 males and females had higher nesting scores when compared to SMALL and <b>Control</b> <b>strains.</b> Male BIG 1 and BIG 2 strains showed more compulsive-like nesting than BIG 1 and BIG 2 proestrus females, which was not observed among the other strains.

In the depression-like forced swim test proestrus females demonstrated less depression-like behavior than males.
