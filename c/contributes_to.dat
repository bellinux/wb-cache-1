5|$|Fourth, camber thrust <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> the {{centripetal}} force necessary {{to cause the}} bike to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is {{greater than that of}} the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E

5|$|Primary {{ingredients}} in an old-fashioned doughnut include flour, sugar, eggs, sour cream or buttermilk, and leavening agents such as baking powder or baking soda.
