5|$|The police {{close in}} on their suspect, Lowe (Roy Heather), who is {{severely}} injured in a fall while trying to escape. Dying, he tells <b>Craven</b> {{he was working with}} McCroon, a terrorist <b>Craven</b> had had convicted in Northern Ireland. Emma's boyfriend, Terry Shields (Tim McInnerny), tells <b>Craven</b> that she was investigating a hot cell in Northmoor; he is later killed. <b>Craven</b> meets Harcourt and Pendleton at the House of Commons where an inquiry is taking place into the sale of International Irradiated Fuels (IIF) – Northmoor's owners – to the Fusion Corporation of Kansas, owned by Jerry Grogan (Kenneth Nelson). Pendleton tells <b>Craven</b> that he believes Grogan was behind Emma's death. Returning to Yorkshire for Emma's funeral, <b>Craven</b> is refused permission to seek a warrant to enter Northmoor. Returning home, he is observed by McCroon (Sean Caffrey).|$|E
5|$|As he {{continues}} his investigations, <b>Craven</b> is visited by Emma's ghost. The fingerprints on the getaway car used by Emma's killer match that of Lowe, a man <b>Craven</b> arrested ten years previously. Meanwhile, Pendleton takes <b>Craven</b> {{to meet his}} colleague, Harcourt (Ian McNeice), who informs him that Emma {{was a member of}} a subversive anti-nuclear group called GAIA. A team of six GAIA members, led by Emma, had broken into a low level radioactive waste facility at Northmoor; all are now either dead or missing. After <b>Craven</b> makes a televised appeal for information about Emma's killer, he is contacted by CIA agent Darius Jedburgh (Joe Don Baker), an associate of Harcourt and Pendleton. Jedburgh shows <b>Craven</b> the CIA's file on Emma's activities: GAIA had become suspicious of Northmoor when a nearby reservoir had become contaminated with radioactive material, an occurrence that had also alerted the CIA, leading them to believe Northmoor was illegally storing plutonium. Jedburgh is played as a hard-bitten professional with a wry sense of humour and a passion for ballroom dancing. Along with Harcourt and Pendleton, he is keen to find the source and purpose of the plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Emma's ghost {{appears to}} <b>Craven</b> {{and tells him}} {{of a time when}} black flowers grew, warming the Earth and {{preventing}} life from becoming extinct. She tells him that the black flowers have returned and will melt the polar icecaps, destroying mankind so that life can continue. <b>Craven</b> goes to dissuade Jedburgh from the next step in his plan, which is to cause a nuclear explosion in Scotland {{with the rest of the}} plutonium. He succeeds, though the secret service follow him and kill Jedburgh. <b>Craven,</b> like Jedburgh and Grogan fatally exposed to radiation, wanders into the mountains to die, calling Emma's name. On the mountains, as Emma predicted, the black flowers are growing, foreshadowing the planet's war against humanity.|$|E

5|$|McCroon {{breaks into}} Craven's house intent on killing him. <b>Craven</b> demands McCroon tell him {{who he is}} working for but McCroon is shot by a police {{marksman}} before he can say anything. Through a contact of Mac (Struan Roger), a colleague from his time in Northern Ireland, <b>Craven</b> gains access to a terminal connected to the MI5 computer. He checks the MI5 records for GAIA, Northmoor and Emma and learns that McCroon was acting on the orders of Northmoor Security. He also obtains a three-dimensional map of Northmoor from the computer. <b>Craven</b> contacts Jedburgh and asks him to accompany him inside Northmoor.|$|E
5|$|Ronald <b>Craven</b> {{was played}} by Bob Peck, {{an actor who}} was well known in theatre but, {{at the time he}} was cast as <b>Craven,</b> had {{appeared}} in only minor roles on television. In creating the role of <b>Craven,</b> Peck drew upon his experience gained from the two years he played the title role in Macbeth for the Royal Shakespeare Company. Notable roles after Edge of Darkness included On the Black Hill (1987), Slipstream (1989), Natural Lies (1992) and Jurassic Park (1993). He died in 1999.|$|E
5|$|When {{repairs to}} <b>Craven</b> Sluices were {{necessary}} in 1684, {{the water was}} temporarily diverted into Scots Float Channel. This worked well, and a regulating penn was built, so that water could be routed to <b>Craven</b> Sluices or Scots Float. Knock Sluice was built below the Appledore Sluice in 1686, and land above it was reclaimed. In 1696, New Knock Sluice was built, close to <b>Craven</b> Sluices, and the sea was finally excluded from the Wittersham Levels.|$|E

5|$|Restoration {{work was}} carried out in the 1830s by William <b>Craven,</b> the Earl of <b>Craven.</b> This was a {{deliberate}} attempt at conserving the existing building, rather than rebuilding it, and was a very unusual approach at this time. By 1845, stone buttresses and pillars had been added to support parts of the hall and its roof. Research by Thomas Turner was published in 1851, outlining the history of the castle. Frances Stackhouse Acton, a local landowner, took a particular interest in the castle, and in 1853 convinced William to carry out further repair work on the castle, under her supervision, at a cost of £103.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, {{the rest}} of the possemen were going after Ben <b>Cravens,</b> who was trying to escape through some tall grass on {{the eastern side of the}} creek. At the same time Ainsley was wounded, Richard Clarke struck <b>Cravens</b> in the side with a load of buckshot and he fell to the ground, {{concealed}} in the grass. It took some time before the possemen were able to find where the outlaws had fallen and relieve them of their weapons. During the search, Cox and his men heard the wounded McGregg groaning and mistook him for Lund. They called out to him to see if he was okay, but the real Lund did not reply because he was afraid that it was a trick by <b>Cravens.</b> It was not until Lund overheard the possemen talking about where they had found <b>Cravens</b> that he knew who they were. Lund then ordered one of the men to find Ainsley and take his guns while he went to the eastern side of the creek to find <b>Cravens.</b> When he arrived in the area, Lund had one of the others fire towards the concealed <b>Cravens,</b> causing him to put his hand up above the grass and identify himself. The posse demanded that <b>Cravens</b> show both of his hands, but, after sneaking closer, they found the outlaw badly hurt, his other hand being used to hold his wounds.|$|R
50|$|Again {{elected to}} the Seventy-third and to the three {{succeeding}} Congresses, <b>Cravens</b> also served from March 4, 1933, until his death. His son William Fadjo <b>Cravens</b> of Arkansas, was {{elected to the}} Seventy-Sixth Congress, to fill the term of his vacancy.|$|R
5|$|After Crawford graduated, Professor A. J. Herbertson {{offered him}} {{a job as a}} junior {{demonstrator}} in the university's geography department. Crawford agreed, and served in the teaching position over the ensuing year. Through Herbertson, Crawford was introduced to the geographer Patrick Geddes. Crawford then decided to focus his attentions on archaeology rather than geography even though few professional positions in the field existed in Britain at the time. Looking elsewhere for archaeological employment, he unsuccessfully applied for a <b>Craven</b> Fellowship and for a post at Bombay Museum.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach to designing smaller waveguide filters {{was provided by}} the use of non-propagating evanescent modes. Jaynes and Edson proposed evanescent mode waveguide filters in the late 1950s. Methods for designing these filters were created by <b>Craven</b> and Young in 1966. Since then, evanescent mode waveguide filters have seen successful use where waveguide size or weight are important considerations.|$|E
5|$|By February King Stephen marched {{north to}} deal with David. The two armies avoided each other, and Stephen was soon on the road south.

A pitched battle took place, the battle of Clitheroe, and the English army was routed.|$|E
40|$|Ezra Pound met Margaret <b>Cravens</b> in Paris in 1910 {{during one}} of his most {{creative}} and formative periods. Margaret <b>Cravens,</b> of Madison, Indiana, had come to Paris several years earlier to study piano and was drawn to the young Pound out of a shared interest in poetry and the arts. Their friendship began when she offered Pound generous financial support, which continued, unknown to anyone else, until June 1912, when she committed suicide in Paris, one year after her father 2 ̆ 7 s suicide in Indiana. Pound was deeply affected by her death, as was the poet H. D., who had recently come to know her. Pound 2 ̆ 7 s letters to <b>Cravens,</b> extensively annotated, are published here for the first time; her suicide note to him is also included. Ezra Pound and Margaret <b>Cravens</b> contains photographs and previously unpublished material by Pound and H. D., as well as an excerpt from H. D. 2 ̆ 7 s autobiographical novel Asphodel, in which <b>Cravens</b> figures prominently. This portrait of a friendship provides insight into the literary achievements of Pound and H. D. and tells the unknown story of Margaret <b>Cravens</b> 2 ̆ 7 s tragic life. [URL]...|$|R
