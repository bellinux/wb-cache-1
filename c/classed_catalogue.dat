Besides the simple {{detection of}} changes between at least two images acquired at different times, analyses which aim on the change type or category are at least equally important. In this study, an approach for a semi-automatic classification of change segments is presented. A sparse dataset is considered to ensure the fast and simple applicability for practical issues. The dataset is given by 15 high resolution (HR) TerraSAR-X (TSX) amplitude images acquired over a time {{period of one year}} (11 / 2013 to 11 / 2014). The scenery contains the airport of Stuttgart (GER) and its surroundings, including urban, rural, and suburban areas. Time series imagery offers the advantage of analyzing the change frequency of selected areas. In this study, the focus is set on the analysis of small-sized high frequently changing regions like parking areas, construction sites and collecting points consisting of high activity (HA) change objects. For each HA change object, suitable features are extracted and a k-means clustering is applied as the categorization step. Resulting clusters are finally compared to a previously introduced knowledge-based <b>class</b> <b>catalogue,</b> which is modified until an optimal class description results. In other words, the subjective understanding of the scenery semantics is optimized by the data given reality.

Furthermore, classes which were defined too coarsely might be divided into sub-classes. Consequently, classes which were initially defined too narrowly might be merged.

40|$|During {{recent years}} the {{increasing}} adoption of Open Data Initiatives and Lined Data principles have lead {{to the creation of}} a globally distributed space of Linked Data that covers various domains such as Government, Libraries, Life Sciences, Media, Geographic and Social web. Approaches that conceive this data space as a huge distributed data sources and enable an execution of declarative queries over this database hold an enormous potential; they allow users to benefit from a virtually unbounded set of up-to-date data. As a consequence, several research groups have started to study such approaches. The Life Sciences domain has been one of the early adopters of Linked Data, and at present a considerable portion of the Linked Open Data cloud is comprised of datasets from Life Sciences Linked Open Data, known as LS-LOD. Although the publication of datasets as RDF is a necessary step towards achieving unified querying of biological datasets, it is not enough to achieve the interoperability necessary to enable a query-able Web of Life Sciences data. This can be achieved either by âa priori integrationâ, by ensuring multiple datasets make use of the same vocabularies and ontologies, or, alternatively using âa posteriori integrationâ, which makes use of mapping rules that change the topology of graphs such that integrated queries become possible. âa posteriori integrationâ, in Biomedical and Life Science data sources is the topic of this thesis. This dissertation first provides an analysis of freely and openly available data sources (SPARQL endpoints). Public SPARQL endpoints were analysed with two considerations i. What is the content of a public SPARQL endpoint? and ii. How self descriptive are these endpoints? For analysing public SPARQL endpoints we defined a set of self descriptive SPARQL queries. After this analysis we introduce the notion, namely Autonomous Resource Discovery and Indexing (ARDI), for facilitating âa posteriori integrationâ, in Biomedical and Life Science data sources. In particular, we introduce a Cataloguing and Linking mechanism that enables us to formally query Biomedical and Life Sciences Linked Open Data on the World Wide Web (WWW). As of 31 st March 2016, the ARDI consists of 263, 731 triples representing 12, 658 distinct classes, 1, 792 distinct properties and 13, 027 distinct Orphan <b>classes</b> <b>catalogued</b> from 137 public SPARQL endpoints. Based on these Cataloguing and Linking approaches, we propose BioFed which is a federated query processing engine for Life Sciences Linked Open Data. BioFed offers a single-point-of-access for distributed Life Science data which enables scientists to access the data from reliable sources without extensive expertise in SPARQL query formulation. BioFed federates SPARQL queries over more than 137 public SPARQL endpoints. After demonstrating ARDI and its practical applications, this dissertation focuses on presenting Linked Biomedical Dataspace (LBDS) that enables the semantically-enriched representation, exposure, interconnection, querying and browsing of Biomedical data and knowledge in a standardised and homogenised way. We provide three practical scenarios known as workflows for using proposed LBDS and also list the Lessons Learned and Recommendations for developing different components of LBDS as we believe our gained insights will be useful for LD practitioners and researchers working on the topics similar to those covered in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Land {{cover and}} land use classifications provide {{significant}} information for politics, economy and science. CORINE Land Cover (CLC) represents a harmonised Pan-European land cover dataset utilised by many European and national institutions. The mapping product comprising 44 classes of land cover {{and land use}}, is well documented. At {{the same time it}} is periodically updated in intervals of 10 years. Mainly due to the complexity of the CORINE nomenclature, generating and updating of this product has ever since been solely based on computer–aided manual image interpretation. To this date, manual interpretation being the backbone of CORINE actualisation has not been replaced by computer aided approaches. As a consequence, this study aims at developing a semi-automated methodology to derive CORINE Land Cover from optical remotely sensed data. The methodology presented, is based upon the former CLC 1990 classification and the Landsat ETM+ based Image 2000 while reference and validation is realised utilising the CLC 2000 data set. Implementation of the presented approach is realised by the software package gnosis combining object oriented classification paradigms with theories related to human image perception. Human image perception itself is known to be a process of information engineering including three sub-processes as follows: image segmentation, feature generation, and class assignment. With regard to image segmentation, meaningful image segments are generated based upon the most simple image primitives, the pixels. Resulting image segments consist {{of a wide range of}} invariant image features describing actual CLC classes. However, precise knowledge about land cover is the uttermost important information for any further processing steps presented in this work. Therefore, ten baseline land cover classes are extracted from multi spectral image 2000 data sets using a novel supervised classification approach of support vector machines. In order to estimate the anthropogenic impact affecting some CORINE classes, the phenological characteristics are analysed and processed. Thus temporal parameters like temporal variability and temporal intensity are used for the delineation of pastures and arable land. Conjointly with these vegetation features, neighbourhood analysis is used to derive functionality or heterogeneity of complex classes. At last, additional error reduction and further specification is addressed by the extraction of fuzzy features. Based on these features sets, CLC classes are represented abstractly stored within a <b>class</b> <b>catalogue</b> i. e. an a-priori knowledge base. Class assignment itself is based on the representation of CORINE objects by its integral parts. In the following this sub-process, representing the final step of image perception, is used to compare the extracted structures with the prototypical classes of the knowledge base. On one hand homogeneous classes, consisting of a single land cover type of baseline classes like forests and pastures, are identified with a bottom–up approach. This is based on the assumption that any superior CLC object is composed of and therefore directly linked to its components and consecutively assigned to a specific CLC class. On the other hand heterogeneous classes, consisting of multiple cover types like complex cultivation patterns, can be validated by comparing its components to the knowledge base, i. e. a top–down approach. However, the a-priori geometry provided by a former classification is essential for this type of object recognition. The analysis of test sites located in the vicinities of Frankfurt, Berlin, and Oldenburg indicates that 13 CLC classes can be identified automatically while a second set of 14 CLC classes can be validated. On the contrary, ten classes can not be acquired by the presented approach due to the lack of required features or missing ancillary information. Thus the overall accuracy of the automated classification of the test sites ranges between 70...|$|R

This thesis {{explores the}} {{importance}} of the function of religion {{in the life of the}} average, non-royal woman in Ancient Egyptian society. As Ancient Egyptian society and the historical documentation thereof were dominated by the male perspective, the extent of religious participation by women was, until recently, underestimated. Recent research has shown that women had taken part in, and in some cases even dominated, certain spheres of Ancient Egyptian religion. This included religious participation in public, as well as the practice of certain religious rituals in the home. The religious lives of ordinary women of non-royal families were studied by looking at their involvement in the public aspects of Egyptian religion, such as temples, tombs and festivals, as well as at the influence of religion on their identities as women and mothers. The research method followed was that of an iconographical analysis of original sources, which were classified and examined in order to establish their religious links to women of the middle and lower <b>classes.</b> A <b>catalogue</b> of sources is given, including sources depicting women participating in public rituals and objects used in a more domestic sphere.

40|$|The {{correlation}} function of galaxy clusters {{has often been}} used as a test of cosmological models. A number of assumptions are implicit in the comparison of theoretical expectations to data. Here we use an ensemble of ten large N-body simulations of the standard cold dark matter cosmology to investigate how cluster selection criteria and other uncertain factors influence the cluster {{correlation function}}. We consider the effects of varying the definition of a cluster, the mean number density (or equivalently the richness) in a catalogue, and the assumed normalisation of the model; we also examine the importance of redshift space distortions. We implement five different group-finding algorithms and construct cluster catalogues defined by mass, velocity dispersion or a measure of X-ray luminosity. We find that different cluster catalogues yield correlation functions which can differ by substantially more than the statistical errors in any one determination. For a given cluster selection criteria, the correlation length typically varies by ∼ 20 % in catalogues spanning the range of intercluster separations covered by the APM and Abell (richness <b>class</b> 1) <b>catalogues.</b> Distortions produced by peculiar velocities in redshift space enhance the correlation function at large separations and lead to a larger clustering length in redshift space than in real space. The sensitivity of the cluster correlation function to various uncertain model assumptions substantially weakens previous conclusions based on the comparison of model predictions with real data. Detailed modelling of cluster selection procedures including the effects of selecting from projected galaxy catalogues is required before the cluster correlation function can be regarded as a high precision constraint on cosmological models.

40|$|Introduction The public library, being a local centre for {{information}} – making {{a variety of}} information and knowledge available to its users, requires a well planned and good method of organizing and keeping the records of its materials. This is the reason why cataloguing and classification in any library should be given the necessary professional touch(s) especially in the era information communication technology (ICT). ICT in the words of Ejedafiru (2010) refers to technology that transmits, stores, creates, displays, shares, or exchanges information by electronic means. Cataloguing and classification of a book simply put, has to do with sieving out and organizing the bibliographic information of a reading material, arranging them in a particular order and grouping the reading materials mainly books into <b>classes.</b> <b>Cataloguing</b> and classification as well as other library activities/services have witnessed reasonable changes in the era of ICT. In the words of Arkoful (2007), these technologies have accelerated the rate at which library services and routines are carried out. The work of cataloguers have changed and expanded as noted by Crosby (2001). According to her, cataloguers classify books, videos, CD-ROMS, and other materials so as to enable users find what they are looking for. Cataloguing has grown more important as searchers log on to on-line catalogues from home. Technology has made cataloguing more efficient. In the words of Youngman (1999), cataloguers are moving into new roles as they attempt to provide enhanced access to the new resources. They now process not only books, but also CD-ROMs, computer discs, and multi-format items. Cataloguers add the records they create to a shared international database. It is known that librarians have been sharing catalogues for a long time, but electronics and the internet have made it easier. Because of on-line access, making catalogues easy to use is more critical and more possible. Using computers, Crosby (2001) said, librarians are starting to create different catalogues for different kinds of readers. A catalogue designed for casual browsers for instance, she said, might display summaries of each book while the one designed for preschoolers might use more graphics or might not rely as heavily on putting things in alphabetical order. Cataloguers in the present day information age are required to and must make informed decisions on matters such as linking to electronic journals and managing holdings “hooks” to various databases. Cataloguers today create records that accommodate multiple means of accessing a particular resource. Library patrons are coming to expect records that include print holdings, microforms, and direct links to an electronic version of the item. Cataloguing the internet itself is a task that has fallen on librarians, affirmed Youngman. Application of the Dublin Core metadata tag systems is a skill that did not exist {{just a few years ago}} but is now rapidly growing in importance as an additional role for librarians. As Chepesuik (1999) earlier noted, “it is not a metadata element set to replace MARC, rather it is going to evolve alongside it”. Crosby confirmed this by saying that some librarians are helping to organize the internet as they are setting their sights on digital information. Many pieces of materials on the internet have digital tags that describe them so that search engines can find them more easily. These tags – (metadata tags) might say who wrote the material or what it is about. So they organize books, but that is rarely done with card catalogues rather they use databases and digital metadata tags. Francis-Swanson (2010) presenting it in more common terms said that a feature of today’s library is the Online Public Access Catalogue which is database containing the library’s collection that can be accessed by anyone on-line. She added that academic libraries now can offer full text electronic subscription-based journals to their users that can be accessed via the library’s web page in addition to supplying a user name and pass word. Cataloguers no longer catalogue and classify books only but also electronic materials like C D ROMs (where available). Also they do access online catalogues, transform the available bibliographic records to machine readable formats, engage in resource sharing and networking. Yusuf (2009) asserted that in recent times, library systems developers have worked hard to create a machine readable library catalogue that provides functionality beyond that of analog card to accommodate technological changes. It has become obvious that book cataloguing cannot be relied upon in the era when information materials have come to take electronic formats and information flow virtually...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 45 - 49) The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine the status of commercial music programs in the public two-year colleges of California during the 1974 - 1975 academic year. It was designed to collect and document the current commercial music course offerings of the various colleges. The data for the study was derived from questionnaire replies from fifty-two California public two-year college music department chairmen or their representatives, information extracted from current 1974 - 75 college <b>catalogues,</b> <b>class</b> schedules, music department bulletins, personal interviews, plus material discovered through extensive research in numerous public and university libraries. The compiled data was analyzed, presented, and discussed in text and tabular form. The following conclusions were formulated: (1) The greatest number of public two-year colleges offering commercial music programs and courses in commercial music are located, almost exclusively, in the southern section of the state of California, (2) the most popular commercial music course continues to be, historically, the Stage or Dance Band, (3) new courses such as Music Notation and Copying, Arranging, Studio or Recording Band, Commercial Music Technique, and Jazz Theory and Improvisation are finding their way into the curriculum, (4) further investigation of course content in the area of commercial music is recommended for greater uniformity and possible standardization, and (5) reflecting rising student demand, more courses in commercial music will gradually find their way into the curriculums of most California public two-year college...|$|R

The first-years open {{a show on}} 7 June 2010 at the University Club; just behind them {{a new class of}} eight students, selected from a very large pool of the most talented college graduates in the country, readies itself to matriculate in the fall. This cycle has been repeated now for some four decades, always culminating in the annual MFA Exhibition. The graduate program in Studio Art maintains a curriculum of diverse and cross-disciplinary study, emphasizing creative and independent studio practice and advanced intellectual inquiry. Studio Art at UC Davis enjoys an illustrious history—the confluence between 1959 and 1962, for example, of Robert Arneson, Roy De Forest, Manuel Neri, Wayne Thiebaud, and William T. Wiley. This exhibition catalogue, we believe, documents the continued flourishment of young artists and their mentors on the Davis campus. The essays here introducing the work of each artist are by Renny Pritikin, director of the Nelson Gallery, to whom the students, faculty, and I express our ongoing collegial thanks. Professor Annabeth Rosen served as director of graduate studies for this <b>class.</b> The <b>catalogue</b> design is by Rudy Garibay of the Arts Administrative Group, veteran designer for campus publications in Music and Theatre and more recently the California Lighting Technology Center at UCD. I am especially pleased that the electronic version of the catalogue will represent our inaugural deposition to the University of California's eScholarship project at the California Digital Library. Visit www. escholarship. org/uc/aah. Additionally we are very grateful to the entire staff of the Nelson Gallery: Renny Pritikin, director; Katrina Wong, assistant to the director and designer of the promotional materials; Robin Bernhard, collection manager; and Kyle Monhollen, senior preparator; to the staff of the Pence Gallery: Natalie Nelson, director; Eileen Hendren, office manager; to the musicians for Robert Machoian's work, led by Richard Chowenhill of the Department of Music; and, always, to the donors whose generosity to the Department of Art and Art History has resulted in the endowments that enable our program to attract and support artists of the caliber presented here: family of Robert Arneson, Marcia Cary, Freemon Gadberry, Richard and Fay Nelson, Mary Lou Osborne, Wayne Thiebaud and family, and Nettie Weber.

The {{goal of this}} diploma work is {{to clarify}} the {{development}} of Czech porcelain production between 1945 and 1965. The first chapter discusses the porcelain history in Europe and Bohemia from the early beginnings {{to the time of}} the Second World War. The main part of the paper is dedicated to porcelain design after the end of World War II. The situation changed because of nationalization and porcelain production came into Czech hands at this time. The text goes over the recovery of porcelain production and the variety of the selection of designs. The paper then elaborates on the effects of the ideology and economy on the porcelain industry. The research details the Expo 58 international exhibition in Brussels and the XII Trienale in Milano, during that time czech porcelain had a first <b>class</b> quality. A <b>catalogue</b> of artists, porcelain manufactures and other important, relevant institutions is also included as well as brief CV s of single artists and reviews of their designsÚstav pro dějiny uměníInstitute of Art HistoryFaculty of ArtsFilozofická fakult...|$|R

When we begin to teach children writing, we force them to absolute copyism, and require absolute accuracy {{in the formation of}} the letters; as they obtain command of the received modes of literal expression, we cannot prevent their falling into such variations as are consistent with their feeling, their circumstances, or their characters. So, when a boy is first taught to write Latin, an authority is required of him for every expression he uses; as he becomes master of the language he may take a license, and feel his right to do so without any authority, and yet write better Latin than when he borrowed every separate expression. In the same way our architects would have to be taught to write the accepted style. We must first determine what buildings are to be considered Augustan in their authority; their modes of construction and laws of proportion are to be studied with the most penetrating care; then the different forms and uses of their decorations are to be <b>classed</b> and <b>catalogued,</b> as a German grammarian classes the powers of prepositions; and under this absolute, irrefragable authority, we are to begin to work; admitting not so much as an alteration in the depth of a cavetto,[171] or the breadth of a fillet. Then, when our sight is once accustomed to the grammatical forms and arrangements, and our thoughts familiar with the expression of them all; when we can speak this dead language naturally, and apply it to whatever ideas we have to render, that is to say, to every practical purpose of life; then, and not till then, a license might be permitted, and individual authority allowed to change or to add to the received forms, always within certain limits; the decorations, especially, might be made subjects of variable fancy, and enriched with ideas either original or taken from other schools. And thus, in process of time and by a great national movement, it might come to pass that a new style should arise, as language itself changes; we might perhaps come to speak Italian instead of Latin, or to speak modern instead of old English; but this would be a matter of entire indifference, and a matter, besides, which no determination or desire could either hasten or prevent. That alone which it is in our power to obtain, and which it is our duty to desire, is an unanimous style of some kind, and such comprehension and practice of it as would enable us to adapt its features to the peculiar character of every several building, large or small, domestic, civil or ecclesiastical.|$|R

That alone which it is in our power to obtain, and which it is our duty to desire, is an unanimous style of some kind, and such comprehension and practice of it as would enable us to adapt its features to the peculiar character of every several building, large or small, domestic, civil, or ecclesiastical. I have said that it was immaterial what style was adopted, so far as regards the room for originality which its developement would admit: it is not so, however, when we take into consideration the far more important questions of the facility of adaptation to general purposes, and of the sympathy with which this or that style would be popularly regarded. The choice of Classical or Gothic, again using the latter term in its broadest sense, may be questionable when it regards some single and considerable public building; but I cannot conceive it questionable, for an instant, when it regards modern uses in general: I cannot conceive any architect insane enough to project the vulgarization of Greek architecture. Neither can it be rationally questionable whether we should adopt early or late, original or derivative Gothic: if the latter were chosen, it must be either some impotent and ugly degradation, like our own Tudor, or else a style whose grammatical laws it would be nearly impossible to limit or arrange, like the French Flamboyant. We are equally precluded from adopting styles essentially infantine or barbarous, however Herculean their infancy, or majestic their outlawry, such as our own Norman, or the Lombard Romanesque. The choice would lie I think between four styles:--1. The Pisan Romanesque; 2. The early Gothic of the Western Italian Republics, advanced as far and as fast as our art would enable us to the Gothic of Giotto; 3. The Venetian Gothic in its purest developement; 4. The English earliest decorated. The most natural, perhaps the safest choice, would be of the last, well fenced from chance of again stiffening into the perpendicular; and perhaps enriched by some mingling of decorative elements from the exquisite decorated Gothic of France, of which, in such cases, it would be needful to accept some well known examples, as the North door of Rouen and the church of St. Urbain at Troyes, for final and limiting authorities on the side of decoration.|$|R
