5|$|Traditionally, devices like a blink {{comparator}} {{were used}} in astronomy to detect objects in the Solar System, because these objects would move between two exposures—this involved time-consuming steps like exposing and developing photographic plates or films, and people then using a blink comparator to manually detect prospective objects. During the 1980s, the use of CCD-based cameras in telescopes {{made it possible to}} directly produce electronic images that could then be readily digitized and transferred to digital images. Because the CCD captured more light than film (about 90% versus 10% of incoming light) and the blinking could now be done at an adjustable <b>computer</b> <b>screen,</b> the surveys allowed for higher throughput. A flood of new discoveries was the result: over a thousand trans-Neptunian objects were detected between 1992 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|When Tomoyo After was ported to the PlayStation 2 (PS2), {{improvements}} to the game were included. This edition's scenario was expanded by the original staff after {{the removal of the}} adult content consisting of sex scenes. Yūto Tonokawa wrote some of the additional story for Takafumi and Kanako. With the added scenario and visuals combined, the PS2 edition is 1.5 times longer than the Windows edition. In the original version, the entire cast excluding Tomoya Okazaki, had full voice acting; this was not changed for the PlayStation 2 version. Added support was included so as to make the visuals on the television sharper than in the past with visual novels played on a consumer console rather than on a <b>computer</b> <b>screen.</b> The PS2 version also reduced flickering of the picture, reducing eyestrain.|$|E
5|$|Digital: A Love Story is {{a visual}} novel, or {{interactive}} fiction game, where the game's {{story is told}} primarily through text. The game is presented {{as if on a}} computer from the late 1980s running the Amie operating system (the name and visual appearance a reference to 1.x versions of AmigaOS). The player logs into bulletin board systems, or BBSs, where they read and reply to messages from other people. Messages received from other characters in the game are displayed through a different program on the <b>computer</b> <b>screen.</b> Accessing a BBS requires the knowledge of the telephone number for that board, which the player must type in manually. Boards that require a long-distance telephone number to reach require the player to use illegally obtained long-distance calling card numbers found online. Accessing boards also requires the player to either set up a user account for that board or to know the password necessary to enter the system.|$|E

5|$|Later, Judge Donnelly {{is nearly}} killed when {{she sits on}} a needle filled with {{potassium}} chloride at her home; she is saved when Stabler and Benson rush her to the hospital. O'Halloran tells Stabler and Benson that a mosquito sucked the blood from the killer {{as he or she}} was rigging Zimmer's car, and that the DNA from the blood will likely implicate Harrison. As the DNA is later being processed, however, O'Halloran is stabbed and killed by someone in the forensics lab. Stabler arrives and sees on the <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> that the DNA matches Stuckey just before Stuckey knocks him out from behind. Stuckey then answers Elliot's phone when Benson calls to say that Stabler went out for lunch and forgot his phone. He then ties Stabler to a chair and starts torturing him. Stuckey admits he killed the woman at Coney Island in order to frame Harrison, and that he attacked Zimmer and Donnelly for embarrassing him. Benson arrives and is held at gunpoint by Stuckey, but she convinces Stuckey that she, too, hates Stabler and is in love with Stuckey. While Benson kisses Stuckey to distract him, Stabler kicks him from behind, allowing Benson to knock Stuckey out and free Stabler. When Stabler asks how Benson knew he was in trouble, Benson says that Stuckey told her he went out for sushi, which she knows that Stabler hates.|$|E

In this paper, we present a system architecture to control desk appliances such as <b>computer</b> <b>screens</b> based on recognised desk and computer work activities. In a real-life intervention study at seven desks, we use screen-attached ultrasound sensors and explore a proximity-based activity recognition approach for saving energy by automatically turing <b>computer</b> <b>screens</b> off when not using them. We analyse online performance of our approach regarding recognition rate and screen resume delay. Furthermore, we present a comparative analysis of our proximity-controlled approach against the computer-controlled power management and a non-controlled baseline to quantify energy saving benefits. Our results show energy savings of up to 43 % and 55 % for proximity-controlled <b>computer</b> <b>screens</b> compared to computer-controlled and non-controlled scenarios respectively...|$|R

Newer wearable devices like Google Glass, Narrative Clip, and Autographer offer the ability to quietly log our lives with cameras from a `first person' perspective. While capturing several meaningful and interesting moments, a significant number of images captured by these wearable cameras can contain <b>computer</b> <b>screens.</b> Given the potentially sensitive information that is visible on our displays, {{there is a need to}} guard <b>computer</b> <b>screens</b> from undesired photography. People need protection against photography of their screens, whether by other people's cameras or their own cameras. We present ScreenAvoider, a framework that controls the collection and disclosure of images with <b>computer</b> <b>screens</b> and their sensitive content. ScreenAvoider can detect images with <b>computer</b> <b>screens</b> with high accuracy and can even go so far as to discriminate amongst screen content. We also introduce a ScreenTag system that aids in the identification of screen content, flagging images with highly sensitive content such as messaging applications or email webpages. We evaluate our concept on realistic lifelogging datasets, showing that ScreenAvoider provides a practical and useful solution that can help users manage their privacy...|$|R
