40|$|BACKGROUND: In healthy {{subjects}} {{after an}} overnight fast, glucose production is for approximately 50 % derived from glycogenolysis. If the fast is prolonged, glucose production decreases {{due to a}} decline in glycogenolysis, while gluconeogenesis remains stable. In <b>cerebral</b> malaria, <b>glucose</b> production is completely derived from gluconeogenesis after an overnight fast. It is not known if glucose production also decreases during fasting when its only source is gluconeogenesis. DESIGN: Glucose production was measured by infusion of [6, 6 - 2 H 2]glucose in seven patients with cerebral malaria after prolonging a fast from 20. 30 to 00. 30 hours. RESULTS: Glucose production decreased by approximately 10 % (27. 4 +/- 2. 1 to 24. 7 +/- 1. 6 micromol/kg/min, p = 0. 05), without changes in the plasma concentrations of glucoregulatory hormones, FFA or precursors. CONCLUSIONS: In the patients with <b>cerebral</b> malaria, <b>glucose</b> production decreases during fasting due to a decrease in the rate of gluconeogenesis. These data suggest that the decrease in the rate of glucose production during short-term fasting is actively regulated and not simply due to shrinkage of glycogen content, as in the absence of glycogenolysis, glucose production decreases {{at the same rate as}} normally seen in healthy subjects whose glucose production is for approximately 50 % derived from glycogen and in whom gluconeogenesis is stabl...|$|R

We evaluated the effects of alpha and beta receptor blockade on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism after 16 min transient global brain ischemia. Ischemia was induced by arterial hypotension and a high pressure neck tourniquet in 13 anesthetized cats. Six cats were untreated, 4 received propranoloi 1 mg/kg, IV and 3 a combination of propranolol and phentol-amine, one mg/kg injected one min before recircnlation. Total CBF was measured by continuous monitoring of cerebral venous "*Xe clearance after bolus intra-arterial injection.

In 1996 and 1997, Dugan et al. discovered the superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimicking activiteis of fullerene derivatives. In 2004, the term [...] "nanozymes" [...] was coined by Flavio Manea, Florence Bodar Houillon, Lucia Pasquato, and Paolo Scrimin. In 2006, nanoceria (i.e., CeO2 nanoparticles) was used for preventing retinal degeneration induced by intracellular peroxides. In 2007, Xiyun Yan and coworkers reported that ferromagnetic nanoparticles possessed intrinsic peroxidase-like activity. In 2008, Hui Wei and Erkang Wang developed an iron oxide nanozyme based sensing platform for bioactive molecules (such as hydrogen peroxide and glucose). In 2012, recombinant human heavy-chain ferritin coated iron oxide nanoparticle with peroxidase-like activity was prepared and used for targeting and visualizing tumour tissues. In 2012, vanadium pentoxide nanoparticles with vanadium haloperoxidase mimicking activities were used for preventing marine biofouling. In 2014, it was demonstrated that carboxyfullerene {{could be used to}} treat neuroprotection postinjury in Parkinsonian nonhuman primates. In 2015, a supramolecular regulation strategy was proposed to modulate the activity of gold-based nanozymes for imaging and therapeutic applications. A nanozyme-strip for rapid local diagnosis of Ebola was developed. An integrated nanozyme has been developed for real time monitoring the dynamic changes of <b>cerebral</b> <b>glucose</b> in living brains.

Gold nanoparticles' peroxidase mimicking activities were modulated via a supramolecular strategy for cascade reactions. A molecular imprinting strategy was developed to improve the selectivity of Fe3O4 nanozymes with peroxidase-like activity. Gold nanoparticles with both SERS activity and peroxidase mimicking activity were used to develp bioassays for glucose and lactate in living systems.

An oral glutamine-challenge test was performed, and plasma and <b>cerebral</b> ammonia, <b>glucose,</b> bilirubin, transaminases, endotoxemia, brain water content and ileocecal cultures were measured and liver histology was assessed.

40|$|Lactate {{derived from}} glucose {{can serve as}} an energy source in the brain. However, it is not certain how much lactate, {{directly}} taken from the blood circulation, may replace glucose as an energy source.

The results suggest that the majority of lactate moving into the brain is not used as an energy substrate, and that lactate does not replace glucose as an energy source.

40|$|Despite recent {{advances}} {{in the management of}} aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), the prognosis remains poor. Among others, hyperglycaemia has been identified as a relevant predictor of impaired neurological recovery. However it remains unclear, whether hyperglycaemia itself is causally related to this unfavourable outcome and, consequently, how tight a regimen for glycemic control should be in the acute phase after SAH. In patients following severe head injury, intensive glycemic control using insulin was associated with a critical decrease in <b>cerebral</b> <b>glucose,</b> which, in turn, was related to impaired prognosis. In the present work, the significance of glucose levels in blood and brain for cerebral energy metabolism in SAH patients were evaluated using cerebral microdialysis, a technique for monitoring cerebral metabolism. Further, cerebral effects of insulin treatment were observed. In the present study, hyperglycaemia after SAH occurred predominantly in those patients with neurological deficits and was associated with unfavourable outcome. Episodes of high and low <b>cerebral</b> <b>glucose</b> occurred independently of blood glucose levels and were accompanied by different metabolic patterns: During episodes of elevated <b>cerebral</b> <b>glucose,</b> brain metabolism remained unchanged, while cerebral low-glucose episodes were associated with severe metabolic derangements. There was no correlation between the glucose levels in blood and brain. Consequently, the association of adverse outcome with acute-phase-hyperglycaemia appears not to be mediated by <b>cerebral</b> <b>glucose</b> metabolism. Insulin treatment was predominantly necessary in patients with high-grade SAH. During insulin infusion, blood glucose remained stable while <b>cerebral</b> <b>glucose</b> decreased – accompanied by a reversible increase in glycerol, demonstrating cellular membrane degradation. Since the other metabolic markers remained unchanged and the <b>cerebral</b> <b>glucose</b> levels did not fall below the normal range, a persistent impairment in cerebral metabolism appears unlikely. However, patients with initially low <b>cerebral</b> <b>glucose</b> levels might be at risk for relevant metabolic derangements during insulin therapy.
