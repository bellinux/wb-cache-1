The knowledge acquired in homeopathic science is experimental research on healthy living organisms that are undergoing experimentation using homeopathic medicines [2]. The experimental research on homeopathic plants has been performed in Europe, Mexico, India and Brazil, proving that the principle of homeopathy, as set out in the animal kingdom has been found in plants [3]. This experiment aimed to evaluate the effect of the homeopathic Arsenicum album in decimal (x) and <b>centesimal</b> (cH) <b>scale</b> on the physiological variables of the germination and growth of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) subjected to {{accelerated aging}}. &# 13; &# 13; Materials and methods: The experiment was conducted at the Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Homeopathy, Universidade Estadual de MaringÃƒÂ¡ - UEM. Arsenicum album 6 x and 2 CH matrices were acquired in homeopathic pharmacy. From matrices were prepared further dynamizations in decimal (x) and <b>centesimal</b> (C) <b>scale,</b> according to the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia [4]. In the accelerated aging test were used samples of 200 seeds per treatment distributed evenly forming a single layer on the surfaces of metal wire suspended inside the plastic box containing inside 40 ml of Arsenicum album (9, 12, 18, or 30 x 24 and 9, 12, 18, 24 or 30 C). The control consisted of distilled water. The boxes were placed in BOD-chamber adjusted to 42 Ã‚Â°C and relative humidity 100 % for 96 hours. After this period, led to the germination test, using four replicates of 50 seeds, totalizing 52 experimental units which were placed on germination paper previously soaked with distilled water in an amount equivalent to 2. 5 times the paper weight[5]. The rolls were arranged randomly in the BOD-chamber at 25 Ã‚Â°CÃ‚Â± 2. The interpretation of the test was performed after seven days [6]. Germination percentage (% PG) was determined according to the Rules for Seed Analysis [5]. The length of primary roots (PRL) and hypocotyl (LH) were only performed in normal seedlings. The total length of the radicle (TLR) was calculated as the sum of the lengths of hypocotyl and primary root. The experimental design was completely randomized. We adopted the double-blind procedure, avoiding possible interference from the researcher. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and means compared by Scott-Knott test (P Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0. 05). &# 13; &# 13; Results: Arsenicum album 9 x, 9 CH and 12 CH reduced the percentage of germination (%PG) (Figure 1 A). The highest values in the length of hypocotyl (LH) Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹were observed in 12 and 24 x dilutions, followed by a reduction in intermediate and higher inhibition at 30 x and 9 x. The 18 x does not differ from control. All centesimal dilution presented effect on the variable analyzed. There was an increase in hypocotyl length in the 12, 18 and 24 dilutions, and reduction in 9 and 30 cH dilutions (Figure 1 B). The primary root length (PRL) of sorghum was increased in dilutions 18 and 30 x. However, the centesimal dilutions were not different from control (Figure 1 C). There was an increase in the total length of the seedlings (TLS) in the dilutions 18, 24 and 30 x and reduction in 9 x when compared to control. As for centesimal dilutions, there was an effect only in 18 cH. The other centesimal dilutions were not different from control (Figure 1 D). &# 13; &# 13; Conclusions: In general, homeopathic preparations did not affect the germination percentage except for 9 x, and 9 cH 12 cH dilution. Furthermore, the dilutions reduced the effects on premature aging verified by high values Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹of growth variables. These results suggest that high dilution Arsenicum album can be an alternative to minimize the deleterious effect to high temperature...|$|R

O tomateiro (Solanum lycopersicum) sob sistema de produção convencional está constantemente sujeito a pragas e doenças, os pesticidas orgânicos sintéticos que são usados podem causar graves perturbações ao meio ambiente e à saúde humana. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o efeito de preparados homeopáticos e altas diluições no manejo de pragas e doenças da cultura do tomateiro sob sistema orgânico de produção. Foram conduzidos dois experimentos em condições de campo e um experimento em casa de vegetação. Todos eles em delineamento de blocos casualizados com cultivar Santa Cruz Kada. Os tratamentos constituíram-se dos preparados homeopáticos Staphysagria, Arsenicum album, Sulphur, Arnica montana, preparados em altas diluições de Solanum lycopersicum e Solanum aculeatissimum, nas escalas decimal (DH) e centesimal (CH) de dinamização hahnemaniana. Calda bordalesa, calda cúprica e Bacillus thuringiensis também foram incluídos em doses ponderais. O preparado de Arnica montana 12 DH proporcionou a maior produção de frutos de tomateiro a campo. Danos pela broca pequena foram eficientemente reduzidos com aplicação de Sulphur 12 CH, igualando a B. thuringiensis. O mesmo tratamento não foi eficiente para reduzir a incidência das brocas grandes. B. thuringiensis reduziu a incidência de septoriose a campo. Em casa de vegetação, o preparado em alta diluição de tomateiro na 12 DH suprimiu completamente a incidência de septoriose, enquanto que na 24 DH a doença foi drasticamente reduzida. O uso de preparados homeopáticos e preparados em altas diluições tem potencial para ser eficaz na substituição de pesticidas que são utilizados na cultura do tomate e poderia ser adequado para preencher requisito legal para o sistema orgânico de produção...|$|R
60|$|Let us now {{endeavour}} {{to measure}} {{the relationships between the}} various couplets of digits on a well-defined <b>centesimal</b> <b>scale,</b> first recalling the fundamental principles of the connection that subsists between relationships of all kinds, whether between digits, or between kinsmen, or between any of those numerous varieties of related events with which statisticians deal.|$|E
60|$|Table V. {{tells us}} that the {{percentage}} of whorls in the right ring-finger is 45, and in the left ring-finger 31. Table VIa {{tells us that}} the percentage of the double event of a whorl occurring on both the ring-fingers of the same person is 26. It is required to express the relationship between the right and left ring-fingers on a <b>centesimal</b> <b>scale,</b> in which 0° shall stand for no relationship at all, and 100° for the closest possible relationship.|$|E
60|$|The chief novelty in {{this chapter}} {{is an attempt to}} {{classify}} nearness of relationship upon a <b>centesimal</b> <b>scale,</b> in which the number of correspondences due to mere chance counts as 0°, and complete identity as 100°. It seems reasonable to adopt the scale with only slight reservation, when the average numbers of the Arches, Loops, and Whorls are respectively the same in the two kinds of digit which are compared together; but when they differ greatly, there are no means free from objection, of determining the 100° division of the scale; so the results, if noted at all, are subject to grave doubt.|$|E
60|$|Table XXVI. {{gives the}} results of {{applying}} the <b>centesimal</b> <b>scale</b> to the measurement of the average closeness of fraternal resemblance, in respect to finger prints, according to the method and under the reservations already explained in page 125. The average value thus assigned to {{it is a little}} more than 10°. The values obtained from the three fingers severally, from which that average was derived, are 9°, 10°, and 12°; they agree together better than might have been expected. The value obtained from a set of fifty additional couplets of the middle fingers only, of fraternals, is wider, being 21°. Its inclusion with the rest raises the average of all to between 10 and 11.|$|E
6000|$|If no {{relationship}} should exist, there would nevertheless {{be a certain}} percentage of instances, due to pure chance, of the double event of whorls occurring in both ring-fingers, and it is easy to calculate their frequency from the above data. The number of possible combinations of 100 right ring-fingers with 100 left ones is 100 × 100, and of these 45 × 31 would be double events as above (call these for brevity [...] "double whorls"). Consequently the chance of a double whorl in any single couplet is (45×31)/(100×100), and their average frequency in 100 couplets,--in other words, their average percentage is (45×31)/100 = 13·95, say 14. If, then, the observed percentage of double whorls should be only 14, it would be a proof that the A. L. W. classes of patterns on the right and left ring-fingers were quite independent; so their relationship, as expressed on the <b>centesimal</b> <b>scale,</b> would be 0°. There could never be less than 14 double whorls under the given conditions, except through some statistical irregularity.|$|E
6000|$|The first {{preliminary}} {{experiments were}} made {{with the help of}} the Arch-Loop-Whorl classification, on the same principle as that already described and utilised in Chapter VIII., with the following addition. Each of the two members of any couplet of fingers has a distinctive name--for instance, the couplet may consist of a finger and a thumb: or again, if it should consist of two fore-fingers, one will be a right fore-finger and the other a left one, but the two brothers in a couplet of brothers rank equally as such. The plan was therefore adopted of [...] "ear-marking" [...] the prints of the first of the two brothers that happened to come to hand, with an A, and that of the second brother with a B; and so reducing the questions to the shape:--How often does the pattern on the finger of a B brother agree with that on the corresponding finger of an A brother? How often would it occur between two persons who had no family likeness? How often would it correspond if the kinship between A and B were as close as it is possible to conceive? Or transposing the questions, and using the same words as in Chapter VIII., what is the relative frequency of (1) Random occurrences, (2) Observed occurrences, (3) Utmost possibilities? It was shown in that chapter how to find the value of (2) upon a <b>centesimal</b> <b>scale</b> in which [...] "Randoms" [...] ranked as 0° and [...] "Utmost possibilities" [...] as 100°.|$|E
6000|$|The {{eleventh}} chapter treats of Heredity, and affirmatively {{answers the}} question whether patterns are transmissible by descent. The inquiry proved more troublesome than was expected, {{on account of the}} great variety in patterns and the consequent rarity with which the same pattern, other than the common Loop, can be expected to appear in relatives. The available data having been attacked both by the Arch-Loop-Whorl method, and by a much more elaborate system of classification--described and figured as the C system, the resemblances between children of either sex, of the same parents (or more briefly [...] "fraternal" [...] resemblances, as they are here called, {{for want of a better}} term), have been tabulated and discussed. A batch of twins have also been analysed. Then cases have been treated in which both parents had the same pattern on corresponding fingers; this pattern was compared with the pattern on the corresponding finger of the child. In these and other ways, results were obtained, all testifying to the conspicuous effect of heredity, and giving results that can be measured on the <b>centesimal</b> <b>scale</b> already described. But though the qualitative results are clear, the quantitative are as yet not well defined, and that part of the inquiry must lie over until a future time, when I shall have more data and when certain foreseen improvements in the method of work may perhaps be carried out. There is a decided appearance, first observed by Mr. F. Howard Collins, of whom I shall again have to speak, of the influence of the mother being stronger than that of the father, in transmitting these patterns.|$|E

5000|$|Several potency {{scales are}} {{in use in}} homeopathy. Hahnemann created the {{centesimal}} or [...] "C scale", diluting a substance {{by a factor of}} 100 at each stage. The <b>centesimal</b> <b>scale</b> was favored by Hahnemann for most of his life. A 2C dilution requires a substance to be diluted to one part in one hundred, and then some of that diluted solution diluted by a further factor of one hundred. This works out to one part of the original substance in 10,000 parts of the solution.A 6C dilution repeats this process six times, ending up with the original material diluted by a factor of 100−6=10−12. Higher dilutions follow the same pattern. In homeopathy, a solution that is more dilute is described as having a higher potency, and more dilute substances are considered by homeopaths to be stronger and deeper-acting. The end product is often so diluted that it is indistinguishable from the dilutant (pure water, sugar or alcohol).|$|E

Among the tested homeopathy drugs, Sulphur increased values of fresh and dry biomass more than Arsenicum album. Plant height increased by the two drugs and their respective dinamizations. Whereas Sulphur inhibited dry biomass production, except 6 CH dinamization, it increased substantially mint plant’s essential oil content. Arsenicum album presented the same behavior as Sulphur drug, with the difference that it increased the fresh biomass in 24 and 30 CH dinamizations. Results suggest that Sulphur and Arsenicum album modify plant metabolism, especially by increasing secondary metabolism as occurs with essential oil contents...|$|E
