Extensive use of conventional fuel resources like crude oil and coal rise up a serious problem of increasing CO 2 emission. New records levels of CO 2 were registered during the early beginning of industrial revolution ([URL] Now a day’s more attention is oriented towards developing of biomass power stations owing to the increasing of conventional fuel prices and due to {{the potential to be}} CO 2 neutral. One of the essential issues to successfully simulate and design efficient equipment for best utilization of the bio-fuel is to have better understanding of the interaction of bio-particles and the carrier gas. Almost, all two-phase flow system dealing with bio-mass power is turbulent flow. A unifying theory of turbulence does not yet exist. When particles are suspended into such a flow the flow becomes even more complicated and the resulting interactions between the particles and turbulent structures are not fully understood. For non-spherical particles, like most of the bio-mass particles found in <b>cyclone</b> <b>filters</b> and biomass gasification and combustion, the interactions of the particles and the fluid in turbulent flow are extremely complex while theories exists for low Reynolds number flow. The carrier phase turbulence alters the dispersed phase translational and rotational motion and the particles influence the detailed and overall flow of the carrier phase. The presence of the particles may also modify the turbulence of the fluid. To achieve my objective, to study the interaction of bio-particles with the carrier phase, and because of the complexity of the mechanisms related to such flow, it was essential to start to develop the knowledge on the possible mechanisms for the interactions and the importance of each of these interactions, see Paper A. Also, the controlling parameter which may have qualitative and/or quantitative influence of the flow interaction is covered by Paper A. To enable different types of experiments with PIV and LDA, a horizontal rectangular duct was designed and constructed. Design details and test is presented in Paper B. An introductory experimental series was performed in the current set-up using a high spatial resolution PIV system and the results can be found in Paper C.

40|$|It is {{not easy}} to replace fossil-based fuels in the {{transport}} sector, however, an appealing solution is to use biomass and waste for the production of renewable alternatives. Thermochemical conversion of biomass for production of synthetic transport fuels by the use of gasification is a promising way to meet these goals. One of the key challenges in using gasification systems with biomass and waste as feedstock is the upgrading of the raw gas produced in the gasifier. These materials replacing oil and coal contain large amounts of demanding impurities, such as alkali, inorganic compounds, sulphur and chlorine compounds. Therefore, as for all multi-step processes, the heat management and hence the total efficiency depend on the different clean-up units. Unfortunately, the available conventional gas filtering units for removing particulates and impurities, and also subsequent catalytic conversion steps have lower optimum working temperatures than the operating temperature in the gasification units. This report focuses on on-going research and development to find new technology solutions and on the key critical technology challenges concerning the purification and upgrading of the raw gas to synthesis gas and the subsequent different fuel synthesis processes, such as hot gas filtration, clever heating solutions and a higher degree of process integration as well as catalysts more resistant towards deactivation. This means that the temperature should be as high as possible for any particular upgrading unit in the refining system. Nevertheless, the temperature and pressure of the cleaned synthesis gas must meet the requirements of the downstream application, i. e. Fischer-Tropsch diesel or methanol. Before using the gas produced in the gasifier a number of impurities needs to be removed. These include particles, tars, sulphur and ammonia. Particles are formed in gasification, irrespective of the type of gasifier design used. A first, coarse separation is performed in one or several <b>cyclone</b> <b>filters</b> at high temperature. Thereafter bag-house filters (e. g. ceramic or textile) maybe used to separate the finer particles. A problem is, however, tar condensation in the filters and there is much work performed on trying to achieve filtration at as high a temperature as possible. The far most stressed technical barriers regarding cleaning of the gases are tars. To remove the tar from the product gas there is a number of alternatives, but most important is that the gasifier is operated at optimal conditions for minimising initial tar formation. In fluid bed and entrained flow gasification a first step may be catalytic tar cracking after particle removal. In fluid bed gasification a catalyst, active in tar cracking, may be added to the fluidising bed to further remove any tar formed in the bed. In this kind of tar removal, natural minerals such as dolomite and olivine, are normally used, or catalysts normally used in hydrocarbon reforming or cracking. The tar can be reformed to CO and hydrogen by thermal reforming as well, when the temperature is increased to 1300 ºC and the tar decomposes. Another method for removing tar from the gas is to scrub it by using hot oil (200 - 300 ºC). The tar dissolves in the hot oil, which can be partly regenerated and the remaining tar-containing part is either burned or sent back to the gasifier for regasification. Other important aspects are that the sulphur content of the gas depends on the type of biomass used, the gasification agent used etc., but a level at or above 100 ppm is not unusual. Sulphur levels this high are not acceptable if there are catalytic processes down-stream, or if the emissions of e. g. SO 2 are to be kept down. The sulphur may be separated by adsorbing it in ZnO, an irreversible process, or a commercially available reversible adsorbent can be used. There is also the possibility of scrubbing the gas with an amine solution. If a reversible alternative is chosen, elementary sulphur may be produced using the Claus process. Furthermore, the levels of ammonia formed in gasification (3, 000 ppm is not uncommon) are normally not considered a problem. When combusting the gas, nitrogen or in the worst case NOx (so-called fuel NOx) is formed; there are, however, indications that there could be problems. Especially when the gasification is followed by down-stream catalytic processes, steam reforming in particular, where the catalyst might suffer from deactivation by long-term exposure to ammonia. The composition of the product gas depends very much on the gasification technology, the gasifying agent and the biomass feedstock. Of particular significance is the choice of gasifying agent, i. e. air, oxygen, water, since it has a huge impact on the composition and quality of the gas, The gasifying agent also affects the choice of cleaning and upgrading processes to syngas and its suitability for different end-use applications as fuels or green chemicals. The ideal upgraded syngas consists of H 2 and CO at a correct ratio with very low water and CO 2 content allowed. This means that the tars, particulates, alkali salts and inorganic compounds mentioned earlier have to be removed for most of the applications. By using oxygen as the gasifying agent, instead of air, the content of nitrogen may be minimised without expensive nitrogen separation. In summary, {{there are a number of}} uses with respect to produced synthesis gas. The major applications will be discussed, starting with the production of hydrogen and then followed by the synthesis of synthetic natural gas, methanol, dimethyl ether, Fischer-Tropsch diesel and higher alcohol synthesis, and describing alternatives combining these methods. The SNG and methanol synthesis are equilibrium constrained, while the synthesis of DME (one-step route), FT diesel and alcohols are not. All of the reactions are exothermal (with the exception of steam reforming of methane and tars) and therefore handling the temperature increase in the reactors is essential. In addition, the synthesis of methanol has to be performed at high pressure (50 - 100 bar) to be industrially viable. There will be a compromise between the capital cost of the whole cleaning unit and the system efficiency, since solid waste, e. g. ash, sorbents, bed material and waste water all involve handling costs. Consequently, installing very effective catalysts, results in unnecessary costs because of expensive gas cleaning; however the synthesis units further down-stream, especially for Fischer-Tropsch diesel, and DME/methanol will profit from an effective gas cleaning which extends the catalysts life-time. The catalyst materials in the upgrading processes essentially need to be more stable and resistant to different kinds of deactivation. Finally, process intensification is an important development throughout chemical industries, which includes simultaneous integration of both synthesis steps and separation, other examples are advanced heat exchangers with heat integration in order to increase the heat transfer rates. Another example is to combine exothermic and endothermic reactions to support reforming reactions by using the intrinsic energy content. For cost-effective solutions and efficient application, new solutions for cleaning and up-grading of the gases are necessary...|$|E

The system uses one large cyclonic combustor and a cyclone cleaning system in series to provide hot gases to drive an Allison T- 56 aircraft engine (the industrial version is the 501 -k). A Westinghouse 3, 000 -kW generator is used on the prototype facility with a Philadelphia gear system reducing the 14, 000 -rpm turbine output speed to the 3, 600 -rpm generator operating speed.

Det är en stor utmaning att ersätta fossila bränslen inom transportsektorn, en tilltalande lösning är att använda biomassa och avfall för produktion av förnyelsebara drivmedel. Termokemisk omvandling av biomassa är ett lovande sätt för att producera olika sorters syntetiska drivmedel, då främst genom förgasningsteknik. En av de främsta utmaningarna i att använda termokemisk omvandling av biomassa och avfall är en rening och uppgradering av rågasen som produceras i förgasaren. Dessa material som är tänkta att ersätta olja och kol innehåller betydande mängder av alkaliska-, oorganiska-, svavel- och klor-föreningar. De olika renings- och uppgraderingsstegen påverkar den totala verkningsgraden på hela processen, därför blir hanteringen av värme i de olika process strömmarna viktiga, som för alla processer i flera steg. Dessvärre, har de tillgängliga konventionella gas filtreringsenheterna för att ta bort partiklar och orenheter, och även efterföljande katalytiska omvandlingssteg, lägre optimala arbetstemperaturer än driftstemperaturen hos förgasningsenheterna. Denna rapport fokuserar på pågående forskning och utveckling för att hitta ny teknik och lösningar när det gäller rening och uppgradering av rågas till syntesgas, samt efterföljande bränslesyntesprocesser, såsom hetgas-filtrering, smarta uppvärmnings lösningar och högre grad av integrationsprocess, samt katalysatorer som är mer tåliga mot deaktivering. Detta innebär att temperaturen bör vara så hög som möjligt för varje enskild renings- och en uppgraderingsenhet, likväl måste temperaturen och trycket hos den renade syntesgasen uppfylla kraven för nedströms bränslesyntes, d. v. s. Fischer-Tropsch-diesel eller metanol. Ett antal orenheter behöver tas bort innan gasen som producerats i förgasaren kan användas, dessa inkluderar partiklar, tjäror, svavelföreningar och ammoniak. Partiklar bildas alltid vid förgasning, oberoende av vilken typ av förgasningsteknik som används, en första grovseparation utförs i en eller flera cyklonfilter vid höga temperaturer. För att separera de finare partiklarna används därefter olika keramiska- eller textilfilter, ett problem är dock kondensation av tjära i filtren, mycket arbete utförs på att försöka uppnå filtrering vid så hög temperatur som möjligt, så att man slipper tjärproblemen. Det största hindret när det gäller rening och uppgradering av gaserna är tjära. För att bli av med tjäran från produktgasen finns ett antal olika alternativ, men det väsentligaste är att själva förgasaren drivs vid optimala förhållanden för att minimera att tjära bildas överhuvudtaget. För förgasning med fluidiserad bädd och entrained flowförgasning skulle det första steget kunna vara katalytisk tjärkrackning efter att ha avlägsnat alla partiklar. Vid förgasning i fluidiserad bädd kan aktiva katalysatorer tillsättas till den fluidiserande bädden som kan kracka tjäran redan i bädden och hindra att ytterligare eventuell tjära bildas. Katalysatorer som används är främst naturliga mineraler, såsom dolomit och olivin, dessa användes normalt vid reformering eller krackning av kolväten. Tjäran kan reformeras till vätgas och kolmonoxid genom termisk reformering såsom när temperaturen höjs till 1300 ºC och tjäran sönderfaller. En annan metod för att avlägsna tjära från gasen är att tvätta gasen med hjälp av het olja (200 - 300 ºC). Tjäran löser sig i den heta oljan, som delvis kan vara regenererad och den återstående tjärhaltiga delen kan antingen brännas eller återföras till förgasaren för förgasning. Svavelföreningar är en annan viktig kontaminering som behöver tas bort ur gasen, svavelhalten i gasen beror främst på vilken typ av biomassa som används. Nivåer över 100 ppm inte är ovanligt och är inte acceptabelt för efterföljande nedströms katalytiska processer, eller om utsläppen av t. ex. SO 2  ska hållas nere. Svavel kan separeras genom adsorption med ZnO som är en irreversibel process, eller genom kommersiellt tillgängliga reversibla adsorbenter som kan användas. Ytterligare alternativ är att tvätta/skrubba gasen med en aminlösning. Om ett reversibelt alternativ används kan elementärt svavel framställas med hjälp av Claus-processen. Ammoniak bildas vid förgasning och nivåer runt 3000 ppm är inte ovanligt, men anses vanligtvis inte ett problem efterföljande nedströms processer. Om gasen förbränns, kan dock kväve eller i värsta fall NOx (så kallad bränsle NOx) bildas. Det finns dock indikationer på att problem kan uppstå, speciellt när förgasning följs av nedströms katalytiska processer, exempelvis vid ångreformering där katalysatorn kan deaktiveras vid långvarig exponering för ammoniak Sammansättningen på produktgasen beror framförallt på valet av förgasningsteknik, vilket förgasningsmedel som används, samt viken sorts biomassa sam används. Valet av förgasningsmedel, dvs. luft, syre, vatten, är extra viktigt eftersom det har en direkt inverkan på sammansättningen och kvaliteten hos gasen. Valet av förgasningsmedel påverkar också vilka renings- och uppgraderingsprocesser som kan användas och lämpar sig bäst för olika slutanvändningstillämpningar som t. ex. drivmedel eller för gröna kemikalier. Idealt består en syntesgas som är uppgraderad av vätgas och kolmonoxid i korrekt förhållande, med mycket låga halter vatten och koldioxid. Detta innebär att tjäror, partiklar, alkalisalter och oorganiska föreningar, som nämnts tidigare, måste avlägsnas för de flesta tillämpningarna. Genom att använda syre som förgasningsmedel, i stället för luft, kan innehållet av kväve i gasen minimeras, så man undviker efterföljande dyrbar separation av kväve. Sammanfattningsvis finns det ett antal olika användningsområden för olika producerade syntesgaser. De olika tillämpningarna kommer att diskuteras i rapporten med början med produktion av vätgas, följt av framställning av syntetisk naturgas (SNG), metanol, dimetyleter, Fischer-Tropsch-diesel och syntes av högre alkoholer, samt beskrivningar av metoder som kombinerar dessa. Processystemen är olika där syntes av SNG och metanol begränsas jämvikt, medan syntes av dimetyleter, (DME), FT-diesel och alkoholer inte är jämviktsberoende. Samtliga reaktioner är exoterma, med undantag för ångreformering av metan och tjäror, vilket medför att det är viktigt att kontrollera temperaturökningen i reaktorerna. Dessutom måste syntes av metanol utföras vid högt tryck (50 - 100 bar) för att vara industriellt gångbar. För att hålla nere kapitalkostnaderna för hela reningssystemet och systemets effektivitet behöver man kompromissa, eftersom hanteringen av fast avfall, t. ex. aska, absorberande medel, bäddmaterial och avloppsvatten alla innebär kostnader. Att installera väldigt effektiva katalysatorer resulterar i dyrare gasrening på grund av onödiga kostnader, men nedströms syntesprocesser kommer att dra nytta av effektiv gasrening som förlänger katalysatorernas livstid, särskilt för Fischer-Tropsch-diesel, och DME/metanol syntes. Generellt måste katalysatorerna i de olika uppgraderingsprocesserna vara mer stabila och motståndskraftiga mot olika typer av deaktivering. Slutligen är process-intensifiering ett viktigt område för utveckling inom hela kemiindustrin som bland annat omfattar integration av både syntes och separationssteg, med olika former av avancerad värmeväxling med värmeintegration för att öka värmeöverföringshastigheten, och att kombinera exoterma och endoterma reaktioner. Därför är det nödvändigt med nya innovativa lösningar för rening och uppgradering av gaserna för att få fram kostnadseffektiva och effektiva tillämpningar...|$|E

The device is based on proprietary technology known as the tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) originally developed as a fixed- site environmental particulate mass monitor by Rupprecht and Patashnick Co., Inc., Albany, NY. Currently, the monitoring of exposure to coal mine dust relies on periodic samples taken by traditional coal mine dust sampling units that use a <b>cyclone,</b> <b>filter,</b> pump, and laboratory measurement of the filter mass. Better measurement of mine dust levels has been the goal of industry and labor for nearly two decades. PDM technology offers accurate, end-of-shift and near real time assessment of worker dust exposure. Laboratory and underground tests compared measurements taken by a prototype PDM- 2 (a two-piece TEOM) to the average of multiple personal dust samplers monitoring the same space. In the range of mass loadings P between 0. 5 and 4. 0 mg/m the PDM met a 25 % accuracy criterion 95 % of the time with 95 % confidence. However, some questions still exist about potential bias between types of coal. The prototype two-piece device {{is in the process}} of being combined into a single unit that also contains the miners' cap lamp creating a more ergonomic dust sampling system...|$|R
40|$|A Euro 4 Light-Duty Diesel vehicle {{equipped}} with a diesel particulate filter (DPF) was circulated to 9 labs where repetitions of the current regulatory New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) were conducted. Regulated gaseous and improved (with <b>cyclone,</b> <b>filter</b> temperature 47 ± 5 °C, constant filter face velocity, high precision balance at all labs) particulate mass (PM) measurements were also conducted. A reference particle number (PN) measurement system measuring non-volatile particles was circulated along with the test vehicle. Labs also tested their own PN systems built {{to comply with the}} reference system¿s performance specifications. The mean PN emissions level of the vehicle was below 1 x 1011 particles/km. The intra-lab variability (repeatability) was ~ 40 % and the inter-lab variation was ~ 25 %. The study showed that the new PN method has similar variability to other gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and better than the PM (intra-lab variability ~ 55 % and inter-lab ~ 35 %). Even with the improved PM method the emissions of the vehicle were similar with the background level (~ 0. 4 mg/km) and the method was subject to volatile artifact. The PN method showed greater sensitivity than the PM method as it could distinguish the DPF fill state or different preconditioning states of the vehicle. However, the PN emission level of the vehicle estimated by the reference system were on average 15 % higher than any given lab¿s own system, indicating that the procedures and calibration designed for the standardization of performance should be precisely defined and followed.

40|$|I {{have with}} great {{interest}} read the paper by de Vocht et al. (2009), which compared respirable dust sam-ples collected in the brick-manufacturing industry using both a Higgins–Dewell type cyclone and a dual-fraction IOM sampler. The size separation in the dual-fraction IOM sampler is carried out by a foam inserted into the nozzle of the IOM sampler. I would {{like to comment on}} some of the regression analyses presented and, what I consider to be, a lack of analysis of their data. There is something strange with the model for log-transformed concentration data as it is presented in Fig. 2 and Table 4. The least-squares regression line for the log-transformed data plotted in Figure 2 goes through the origin with a slope (b) of 0. 86 (as stated in the figure caption). However, this b value is not presented in Table 4, which contains slopes for all the four models with the log-transformed data. Nei-ther does the line go through the data presented in Figure 2, which makes it a strange result of a regres-sion analysis. In the paper, no arguments were presented for why the regression model should go through the origin of the log-transformed data. Even if a proportional re-gression model might be valid for the un-transformed respirable concentration data for the IOM dual frac-tion <b>filter</b> and <b>cyclone</b> <b>filter,</b> respectively, (i. e. through the origin of the un-transformed data), CIOMfilter 5 k Ccyc (with k expected to be different from unity), {{this is not the case}} when the data have been log trans-formed. In this case, the proper model is lnCIOMfilter 5 A þ B lnCcyc where A is expected to be approximately equal to ln(k), and B (b in the terminology of the paper) is ex-pected to be approximately unity, if no dependence on concentration is expected or found.

This would minimize the filtration required for the hot gases or conversely the amount of particulate matter in the hot gases after a given level of filtration by <b>cyclones</b> and/or <b>filters.</b> The data obtained during testing characterized the effluent from the bed at different test conditions.

The total and species balances were, in general, fairly well closed, and the increased amounts of heavy metals originating from the input sludge were {{also found in the}} exit flows. Volatile species such as Hg and Cd are sensitive to the temperature conditions. Thus, almost no mercury was found in the bottom ash, and a cyclone at 350 °C captured little Hg in comparison to a <b>cyclone</b> and <b>filters</b> at 150 °C. The high particle loading in a CFB appears to contribute essentially to the reduction of the flue gas mercury concentration; the emission is reduced by orders of magnitude compared to a plant with low particle concentration.

40|$|A {{system to}} remove in situ char/ash from hot {{pyrolysis}} vapors {{has been developed}} and tested at the University of Twente. The system consists of a continuous fluidized bed reactor (0. 7 kg/h) with immersed filters (wire mesh, pore size 5 μm) for extracting pyrolysis vapors. Integration of the filter system in the fluidized bed should overcome operational problems related {{to the increase in}} pressure drop across the filter in time and a decrease in oil yield as typically observed in downstream pyrolysis vapor filtration and lead to process intensification. In this study the effect of in situ hot pyrolysis vapor filtration has been studied with respect to process stability, product yields, and product quality. Oil obtained via a more conventional cyclone system placed in parallel to the filter system served as reference for the quality and yields of the filtered oil. Good process stability concerning temperature and pressure drop across the hot gas vapor filter was achieved during a 2 h run, even when using a reused filter. Particles (char/sand) were retained inside the filter pores located at the outside surface of the filter, while the inside of the filter remained clean apart from some deposits formed on the metal wire and small 1 μm particles which slipped through the filter. Mass balance closures higher than 94 wt % were obtained. Comparable yields (<b>cyclone</b> + <b>filtered</b> oil) were obtained as in the experiments carried out with only the <b>cyclones.</b> The <b>filtered</b> oil contained significantly less solids, alkali metals, and ash compared to cyclone oil. For the alkali metals, only a considerable amount of potassium (K) was still present in filtered pyrolysis oil, which most likely entered the filtered oil via the vapor phase. There {{were no significant differences in}} the elemental composition of the oil produced via the <b>filter</b> line and <b>cyclone</b> line. The molecular weight of the filtered oil obtained with nondried feed was always marginally lower compared to the cyclone oil. Results of the aging tests show that the reactivity of pyrolysis oil can already originate from the highly reactive components in pyrolysis oil itself and does not need the presence of char/ash. To show the intrinsically high reactivity of solids-free pyrolysis oil vapors, an external filter section (1 μm pore size) was placed additionally and in series with the filter inside the fluidized bed. The results show that char is formed from the reactive pyrolysis vapors...|$|R

This technology constitutes a highly effective and continuous way to prepare fascinating materials on the nano- and micro-scale. Within the process, a solution is set under high pressure and sprayed into an evacuated atomization chamber. Subsequent ultrafast evaporation of the solvent leads to an aerosol stream, which is separated by <b>cyclones</b> or <b>filters.</b> No drying gas is required, so the present technique {{should not be confused with}} spray dying.

This study evaluates {{the ability of a}} climate model, HiGEM, to reproduce the precipitation associated with extratropical cyclones. The model is evaluated using the ERA-Interim reanalysis and GPCP dataset. The analysis employs a cyclone centred compositing technique, evaluates composites across a range of geographical areas and cyclone intensities and also investigates the ability of the model to reproduce the climatological distribution of cyclone associated precipitation across the Northern Hemisphere. Using this phenomena centred approach provides an ability to identify the processes which are responsible for climatological biases in the model. Composite precipitation intensities are found to be comparable when all cyclones across the Northern Hemisphere are included. When the <b>cyclones</b> are <b>filtered</b> by region or intensity, differences are found, in particular, HiGEM produces too much precipitation in its most intense cyclones relative to ERA-Interim and GPCP. Biases in the climatological distribution of cyclone associated precipitation are also found, with biases around the storm track regions associated with both the number of cyclones in HiGEM and also their average precipitation intensity. These results have implications for the reliability of future projections of extratropical precipitation from the model...|$|R

40|$|With the {{promulgation}} {{of the new}} National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM 2. 5 in 1997, {{the measurement}} of fine particulate matter from stationary sources becomes more important. A series of tests have been performed on three different natural and refinery gas-fired sources using traditional manual methods (in-stack <b>cyclones</b> and <b>filter</b> with iced-impinger train) and dilution tunnel sampling. The dilution tunnel mixes stack emissions with cleaned ambient air, cooling and diluting them to simulate {{what happens in the}} plume as emissions leave the stack. This type of sampling allows for extensive speciation of the PM 2. 5 fraction including elements, ions, organic and elemental carbon, semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). One result of particular interest is the low percentage of organic carbon (OC) accounted for by the SVOC results. At all locations, the sum of the SVOCs was less than 10 percent of the total OC measured using the dilution tunnel. Dilution tunnel sampling is able to provide a more complete speciation of SVOCs, however this large discrepancy indicates that further investigation is needed. Differences in organic aerosol emissions from natural gas versus refinery gas combustion have also been observed. Results from these tests not only allow comparison of traditional manual methods to dilution sampling, but also allow comparison to ambient sampling results and utilization of data in atmospheric models, such as chemical mass balance models...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{security}} and {{global climate change}} {{are two of the}} greatest challenges that face the next century and {{it will be up to}} this generation to figure out a solution to these monumental challenges. Nearly everything ranging from commerce to travel to education relies on abundant and cheap energy to function and progress. For the last 150 years, this energy has come through the combustion of fossil fuels which are limited by their very nature. As these fuels are combusted to produce heat and power, various harmful gasses are emitted into the atmosphere and can lead to 2 ̆ 2 acid rain, 2 ̆ 2 smog, depletion of the ozone layer, and even a heating of the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface. Gasification of biomass provides one possible solution to both of these problems by utilizing a renewable energy source that is abundant and has the potential to be carbon negative. NOx emissions are regulated by the government and could potentially be the limiting factor on the potential of biomass gasification to have a major impact in overcoming the two greatest challenges of today. It is believed one of the primary causes of NOx emissions is due to nitrogen found in the feedstock that is gasified. This work is aimed at both developing the tools necessary to understand the detailed systems involved in biomass gasification, as well as to characterize the NOx emissions that result from the combustion of the biomass-derived producer gas. In the current work, a two-fold approach is taken to address this issue. First, a process model is created utilizing the software Aspen Plus to simulate data taken from a pilot-scale gasification system utilizing maple and oak wood as the feedstock and air as the gasification medium. This model uses a mass balance approach to simulate the gasification process. A system of <b>cyclones</b> <b>filter</b> out the particulate matter in the producer gas before the gas is burned. Second, the effects of fuel-NOx are studied experimentally utilizing a newly developed lab-scale, low-swirl combustion apparatus. This combustion apparatus is first tested using natural gas that contains low concentrations of ammonia for four swirlers with varying effective areas. A single swirler is chosen to conduct tests to analyze the effect of ammonia concentration on NOx emissions from the producer gas. Results of the current work can be summarized as follows. (1) A biomass gasification model was created to model the gasification of wood feedstock. This model shows very good agreement with experimental results for all components except hydrogen in the producer gas. (2) For the swirlers studied, NOx emissions are reduced as the swirl strength increases. (3) For a natural gas flame, both the equivalence ratio and effect of thermal NOx are important considerations when trying to achieve low NOx emissions. (4) For the combustion of producer gas, higher equivalence ratios reduce the overall NOx emissions. The above results show the need for a greater understanding of producer gas combustion in low-swirl burners for a wide variety of compositions in order to better control overall emissions in the future...|$|R
