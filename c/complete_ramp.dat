5000|$|Semerkhet's burial {{site was}} {{excavated}} in 1899 by archaeologist and Egyptologist Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie at Abydos {{and is known}} as [...] "Tomb U". While excavating, Petrie found no stairways like he did at the necropolis of Den and Adjib. He found a ramp, four metres wide and leading straight into the main chamber. The ramp starts around ten metres east outside the tomb and has a base slope of 12Â°. Inside the tomb the ramp shows irregular graduations. Petrie was also confused by {{the small number of}} clay seals. Only 17 seals were found. For archaeologists and Egyptologists, the complete arrangement of the burial site looks like the builders were pressed for time. When Petrie freed the ramp from sand, he found that the <b>complete</b> <b>ramp</b> was thickly covered in aromatic oil, which still gave off a scent. Beside the ramp several wooden and hand-made baskets and earthen jars were found. These were dated to the Ramesside era. Scholars now think that Semerkhet's tomb was re-opened and restored when Ramesside priests and kings saw the tomb of king Djer as the ritual burial of Osiris's head. The findings inside the main chamber included precious objects such as inlays and fragments of furniture (especially pedestals), copper-made armatures and jewelry made of ebony, amethyst and turquoise. Some vessels originating from the Levant were also found. They once contained Bescha oil, which was of great value to the Egyptians. Outside the tomb, close to the entrance, a damaged tomb stela made of black granite displaying Semerkhet's serekh name was excavated.|$|E
40|$|General {{awareness}} {{of global warming}} has increased interest towards renewable energy solutions. Photovoltaic solar power {{is one of the}} most notable renewable energy production methods and a continuously increasing industry. The power production behavior of photovoltaics, however, is rapidly and intensively fluctuating even on very short timescales. Feeding such fluctuating power into a power system can cause serious stability issues. More and more grid operators are demanding solar power producers to regulate the fluctuations to stay within strict ramp rate limits. Energy storage systems have been recognized as a viable solution for compensating these fluctuations. This thesis delves into the behavior, control and sizing of these systems based on the requirements that the compensation application sets for them. The thesis depicts how solar power can be generally modelled with irradiance and temperature measurements. The model is utilized together with extensive measurement data to study virtual energy storage systems with solar power plants. This thesis demonstrates how the capacity and power requirements of the energy storage are highly dependent on the control method of the system. Notable capacity savings can be made by utilizing state of charge control. The control, however, can cause production outages. Methods to reduce these outages are presented in this thesis in order to enable the use and benefits of state of charge control. The results of this thesis show how the sizing of the storage depends greatly on the size of the plant and the required ramp rate limit. Very strict ramp rate limits require the storage capacity to be relatively high regardless of the plant size. The storage power requirement is inversely proportional to both the generator size and ramp rate limit. Power rating savings can also be made if <b>complete</b> <b>ramp</b> rate limit obedience is not necessary. The thesis also reveals how the fluctuation compensation induces an exponentially decreasing amount of stress to the storage as a function of the required compensation energy. The degradation resulting from the stress is shown to be minimal if an appropriate storage technology is utilized...|$|E

50|$|I-894 {{is only a}} part of an {{important}} history of the Milwaukee area's freeway system. The freeways that exist today are {{only a part of}} what the Milwaukee County Expressway Commission had hoped would be built by 1972. The Zoo Freeway between Beloit Road and North Avenue was completed in 1963. At that time, the portion between Beloit Road and the Zoo Interchange was signed as I-894. The remainder of the Zoo freeway to the Hale Interchange was completed in 1966 when the Airport Freeway was constructed. US 45 was rerouted to the freeway, as was WIS 15 south of National Avenue. (The Rock Freeway had also been constructed west to 108th Street at the time.) The Airport Freeway was proposed to be routed to the also proposed Stadium Freeway South along Howard Avenue which is about 0.75 mi north of the current alignment and named the Howard Avenue Expressway. The Airport Freeway construction was completed in 1966 to fully open I-894. Both freeways were slated {{to become part of the}} Interstate system in 1957, prior to their construction. I-43 was signed along the Airport Freeway concurrently with I-894 in 1988 after being officially designated in 1987.

The study tested the misfit effect and is the first to examine heart rate variability (HRV) responses to exercise in relation to both personality and motivational state. Based on their Paratelic Dominance Scale scores, participants identified as telic dominant (TD) and paratelic dominant (PD) <b>completed</b> <b>ramp</b> tests following telic and paratelic state manipulations (repeated measures). In each condition, participants watched ?serious? (telic) or ?playful? (paratelic) videos for 10 min, then performed a ramp test on a cycle ergometer while continuing to watch the videos throughout the entire protocol. Motivational state (telic/paratelic), HRV, emotion, and stress levels were measured at baseline, pre, post, and 15 min post-ramp test. Time to exhaustion was measured as an index of performance. Limited support was obtained for the misfit effect as interactions between state and dominance were not revealed for any of the variables with the exception of low frequent (LF) and the low frequent/high frequent ratio (LF/HF % normalized), which can be interpreted as indicating that both groups were more relaxed in their preferred state condition. Regardless, findings offer useful insight into methodological considerations for similar studies, such as consideration of the moderating effects of exercise characteristics. Our findings also confirm a number of reversal theory (Apter, 1982) proposals including the concept of dominance as an individual difference factor, with varying characteristics of different dominances, based on physiological response variables. We recommend continued research into the misfit effect with larger samples, and designs that accommodate the methodological considerations raised by the present results. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
