40|$|The {{helminth}} fauna of 76 Emydura macquarii from 3 river {{systems in}} central and northern Queensland was examined. Eleven species were found, including 2 nematodes, 6 trematodes, 1 aspidogastrean, 1 cestode, and 1 monogenean. Analysis of helminth diversity showed that the Fitzroy and Ross <b>River</b> <b>turtles</b> had communities of comparable diversity, but the helminth communities in Proserpine <b>River</b> <b>turtles</b> were much less diverse. The helminth communities in all localities were dominated by trematodes. Polystomoides australiensis was the most prevalent, being found in 60 % of the Ross <b>River</b> <b>turtles,</b> 57 % of the Fitzroy <b>River</b> <b>turtles,</b> and 46 % of the Proserpine <b>River</b> <b>turtles.</b> Notopronocephalus peekayi was the most abundant species, with mean abundances of 5. 9 in the Ross <b>River</b> <b>turtles</b> and 9. 8 in the Fitzroy <b>River</b> <b>turtles.</b> Species richness, Simpson's Reciprocal Index, was highest, 4. 68, for the Ross River helminth community, Sorensen's Qualitative Index showed 95 % similarity between the Ross River and Fitzroy River communities, although Sorensen's Quantitative Index indicated only 35 % similarity between the 2 sites. Host feeding patterns are likely {{the most important factor}} affecting species richness of the helminth infracommunities, as the majority of helminth species are transmitted by food-web interactions involving intermediate hosts...|$|R

50|$|The Mary <b>River</b> <b>turtle</b> {{is one of}} Australia's largest turtles. Specimens {{in excess}} of 50 cm in {{carapace}} length have been recorded. Hatchlings have a straight carapace length of 2.0-3.5 cm. Adult Mary <b>River</b> <b>turtles</b> have an elongated, streamlined carapace that can be plain in colour or intricately patterned. Overall colour can vary from rusty red to brown and almost black. The plastron varies from cream to pale pink. The skin colouration {{is similar to that}} of the shell and often has salmon pink present on the tail and limbs. The iris can be pale blue. Mary <b>River</b> <b>turtles</b> use bimodal respiration, so are capable of absorbing oxygen via the cloaca whilst under water. However, they do regularly come to the surface to breathe air in the usual way.|$|R

50|$|A unique {{feature of}} the male Mary <b>River</b> <b>turtle</b> is the tail, which can measure almost two-thirds of the {{carapace}} length. The tail has haemal arches, a feature lost in all other modern turtles. It is probably a derived feature, but its function is not understood. Another unique feature is the exceptionally long barbels under the mandible. Proportionately, the Mary <b>River</b> <b>turtle</b> has the smallest head and largest hind feet of all the species within the catchment, which contributes to its {{distinction of being the}} fastest swimmer.|$|R
