Objects of research were cigarettes of different constructions containing tobacco blend which includes recovered tobacco and expanded stem. Additionally, tobacco blend was added by aromatic plant material (anise, fennel, lemon balm, sweet grass). Flavored sauced tobacco blend is prepared by mixing cut tobacco and plant raw materials to provide high fill value, toxicity reduction of tobacco smoke and increased combustibility. The composition of the tobacco blend does not contain nicotine plant material and artificial flavors.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to gain further {{understanding}} of the precursors in tobacco of four polycyclic aromatic amines (PAAs) - 1 - and 2 -aminonaphthalene, 3 - and 4 -aminobiphenyl. We carried out non-isothermal pyrolysis of the residues, which were obtained after extraction of tobacco <b>cut</b> <b>filler</b> with methylene chloride followed by extraction with water, under three different pyrolysis conditions (target temperature 800 °C / 800 °C / 400 °C and O 2 concentration in carrier gas 0 % / 20 % / 3 %, resp.). The yields of the four PAAs obtained by the pyrolysis of each sample were evaluated. Several nitrogenous components in the sample were also analyzed. The results under all these pyrolysis conditions showed that 1) the methylene chloride-soluble fraction, in which 50 - 60 % of nicotine was extracted, did NOT contribute significantly contribution to the yields of the four PAAs; 2) the watersoluble fraction, in which most of the nitrogenous inorganic ions and amino acids were extracted, contributed at an average of about 30 % to total PAA yield; and 3) the insoluble residue, in which only protein was detected during the investigation of the nitrogenous components in the present study, showed the highest contribution, 50 - 60 % of the four PAAs formed. Consequently, it is concluded that protein-like components in tobacco contribute highly to the formation of the four PAAs by tobacco pyrolysis...|$|E
40|$|Rose {{is one of}} {{agriculture}} products functioning as decoration plant. Rose petals contain of antocyanin pigment classified as flavonoid and functioning as free radical catcher. Red roses is popularly cultivated by society. Therefore, at harvest time, {{there will be an}} abundant number of red rose that can be processesed inti drink or tablet, such as effervescent. The study aims at investigating the influence of flower post-cut on the quality of red rose extract powder, the influence of flower post-cut and filler type on the quality of red rose effervescent tablet, and the influence of flower post-cut and filler type on the quality of red rose effervescent tablet drink. The study was conducted two stages. Phase I tested the quality of pigment extract of hybrid varieties of Dutch roses, the factor were rose post-cut with 3 levels: fresh (U 0), 2 days flower post-cut (U 1), and 4 days flower post-cut (U 2) which were tested by using a Random Block Design. Phase II used Random Block Design arranged in factorial, consisting 2 factors- both factors consisted 3 levels. Factor II was the type of filler : NaHCO 3 (N 0), KHCO 3 (N 1), CaCO 3 (N 2). The analyses on pigment extract were water rate, pigment rate, pH, and color intensity. After analyzing the effervescent tablet, an observation was then conducted water rate, sugar rate, pH, higrocospisity, tablet density, and color intensity. Based on the finding and discussion, it was revealed that rose post-cut affected pH, absorbance, light (L), and reddish (a+), yellowish (b+) color intensity, while interaction did not occur to water rate and total of soluble solid. Analysis of effervescent tablet discovered that rose post <b>cut</b> and <b>filler</b> type reacted to water rate, texture, light intensity (L), reddish intensity (a+), yellowish intensity (b+), while there was no interaction on hygroscopic. Analysis of effervescent tablet drink revealed that rose post <b>cut</b> and <b>filler</b> type affected pH value, solution speed, color intensity and organoleptic test of flavor. However, rose post <b>cut</b> and <b>filler</b> type did not significantly affect total of soluble solid, organoleptic test on color, appearance and taste...|$|R

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{energy dispersive}} X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometry method {{was developed for}} determining the concentration of palladium (Pd) applied to tobacco <b>cut</b> <b>filler.</b> Control and standards were created in-house with different levels of Pd concentration. After application of the Pd in a salt solution, the tobacco had an average oven volatiles (OV) value of 27. 6 %. Three aliquots were analyzed at each concentration level by EDXRF and inductively coupled plasma- atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Results were plotted against target values to perform a linear regression. EDXRF and ICP-AES coefficient of determination (R 2) values were both lower than the accepted minimum value of 0. 990. Also, measured concentrations varied significantly between replicates. To improve the calibration technique, two options were evaluated: (a) Improve sample homogeneity by lyophilizing and finely grinding the tobacco, and (b) Improve the linear fit of the EDXRF calibration curve by plotting against ICP-AES results. EDXRF and ICP-AES analyses were performed on lyophilized samples with an average OV value of 3. 3 %. Results demonstrated minimum variation between replicates and distinct variation between levels of concentration. Results were plotted against target values, and both EDXRF and ICP-AES R 2 values improved. For evaluation of option (b), EDXRF results were plotted against ICP-AES results to create the calibration curve with an R 2 value of 0. 994.

40|$|This paper explores {{successes and}} {{opportunities}} of the Centre for Native Floriculture 2 ̆ 7 s (CNF) first 3 years of operation (Stage 1; CNF 1) {{and plans for}} CNF 2 (2006 - 09). In addition, some of the challenges for native floriculture, past and future, are evaluated. CNF Stage 1 was established in May 2003 {{with the aim of}} developing novel Australian native species for global floriculture markets. CNF 1 was built on a foundation of conservation biology to foster cultivation over bush-harvesting. It had three programs: marketing and value chain management, floriculture breeding and biotechnology, and capacity building. Value chain program staff conducted domestic and international market research to aid flower growers to understand the markets to which their product was consigned. A second objective was to assist the floriculture program ensure that its selection and breeding activities were market-led based on an understanding of consumer perceptions. Formation of a 2 ̆ 7 model 2 ̆ 7 value chain based on a new product, Backhousia myrtifolia, was facilitated by the value chain program and yielded substantial insight into both industry dynamics and the challenges of exporting a novel <b>cut</b> <b>filler</b> flower product. The floriculture program supports, in addition to a small team of research staff, postgraduate students and visiting fellows who contribute significantly to CNF research output. Floriculture program projects cover: molecular taxonomy, propagation, flowering physiology, phosphorus nutrition, management and control of soil-borne pathogens, postharvest physiology and technology, and plant water relations. Australia is presently experiencing the worst drought in living memory. Thus, the selection of ornamental native plants that are water use efficient has become a priority. In the floriculture program, seeds of 70 prospective novel ornamental species were collected, processed and stored. Two breeding activities have been established, the major one being on Ptilotus. This is an endemic, diverse and highly ornamental genus of about 100 species. Several selections and breeding lines are currently being evaluated by Australian and overseas industry collaborators. The first commercial releases from the Ptilotus selection and breeding activity are expected in mid 2007. Industry capacity building and regional development were a priority for the capacity building progam. In CNF 2, the industry development program will continue short course development and initiate delivery into regional areas. In addition, a series of native floriculture self paced CD-ROM learning packages will be developed for use by industry members. Based on the experience of CNF 1, new challenges and opportunities will be addressed and sought, respectively, by the floriculture program and the industry development program that comprise CNF 2...|$|E

In this scenario, the use of aerated reactors as post-treatment of anaerobic effluent is shown quite promising for Brazilian reality. This work contributes {{to the development of}} new biofilter system for aerobic treatment of sewage, which is being developed at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. The reactor uses corrugated conduit as <b>cut</b> <b>filler,</b> providing a high void ratio, and is capable of producing effluent with turbidity UT order of 1, 2 mg / L of TSS and COD of below 40 mg / L. IT IS objective of this work to investigate the nitrogen removal capacity by simultaneous nitrification and denitrification. The work was divided into four phases, in which has been changed air flow in the filters, and during step 4, introduced a supplementary source of carbon. The system proved to be effective regarding the removal of nitrogen. In the most efficient configuration It was able to remove 56 % of the influent nitrogen, and the less efficient phase removal was 40 %. The principal component analysis showed that the nitrification was the most important factor for the process. It was concluded that the system is able to remove nitrogen through nitrification and simultaneous denitrification. Furthermore, {{it is also important to}} mention that during the more than three years of the experiment duration was not required removal of retained sludge.

50|$|Humectants {{are used}} in the {{manufacturing}} of some tobacco products, such as cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and self-rolled tobacco. They are used to control and maintain the moisture content of the <b>cut</b> tobacco <b>filler</b> and add flavor. Humectants are vital to the creation of cigarettes. In an examination of waterpipe smoking, researchers worked to identify substances such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein in the smoke of a waterpipe, discovering that the value of formaldehyde detected in one smoking session was five times higher than that of a regular cigarette. This data demonstrated that increasing amounts of humectants in the unburned tobacco lowered the temperature in the waterpipe head during smoking, so that considerable amounts of toxic substances were present. Further, e-cigarettes produce aerosol by heating a humectant containing nicotine without burning tobacco. Those “vaping” then inhale the aerosol and receive nicotine.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects are}} {{assessed}} of TiB 2 reinforcement and parent alloy Li content on the weldability of Weldalite (tm) 049 type alloys. Welding trials were performed using either AC or DC polarity gas tungsten arc (GTA) welding according to described procedures. The welding was performed {{under conditions of}} high restraint on 5 cm (2 in) wide x 25. 4 cm (10 in) long plates machined from the 0. 952 cm (0. 375 in) extruded bar parallel to the extrusion direction. A 37. 5 deg bevel was machined on the center edge of the extruded bar. <b>Cut</b> rod <b>filler</b> wire was machined from three alloys, and one commercially available 2319 filler wire was also used. The preliminary assessment of the weldability revealed no propensity for hot cracking under conditions of high restraint. This result is significant, because hot cracking has been reported for all other leading aluminum lithium alloys welded with certain conventional filler alloys. The strengths for Weldalite parent welded with parent filler obtained were higher than those for alloys used in launch systems, such as 2219 and 2014 welded with 2319 and 4043 fillers, respectively. Even higher values were obtained by variable polarity plasma arc welding (e. g., 54 ksi (372 MPa) mean tensile strength) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{safety issue}} has been raised with regards to {{potential}} molten metal detachments from the weld pool and cold filler wire during electron beam welding in space. This investigation was undertaken to evaluate if molten metal could detach and {{come in contact with}} astronauts and burn through the fabric of the astronauts' Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) during electron beam welding in space. Molten metal detachments from either the weld/cut substrate or weld wire could present harm to a astronaut if the detachment was to burn through the fabric of the EMU. Theoretical models were developed to predict the possibility and size of the molten metal detachment hazards during the electron beam welding exercises at Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The primary molten metal detachment concerns were those cases of molten metal separation from the metal surface due to metal cutting, weld pool splashing, entrainment and release of molten metal due to filler wire snap-out from the weld puddle, and molten metal accumulation and release {{from the end of the}} weld wire. Some possible ways of obtaining molten metal drop detachments would include an impulse force, or bump, to the weld sample, <b>cut</b> surface, or <b>filler</b> wire. Theoretical models were developed for these detachment concerns from principles of impact and kinetic energies, surface tension, drop geometry, surface energies, and particle dynamics. The surface tension represents the force opposing the liquid metal drop from detaching whereas the weight of the liquid metal droplet represents a force that is tending to detach the molten metal drop. Theoretical calculations have indicated that only a small amount of energy is required to detach a liquid metal drop; however, much of the energy of an impact is absorbed in the sample or weld plate before it reaches the metal drop on the cut edge or surface. The tendency for detachment is directly proportional to the weld pool radius and metal density and inversely proportional to the surface tension of the liquid metal. For a detachment the initial kinetic energy of the weld pool with respect to the plate has to exceed the energy to form the extra surface required for the detachment of the pool. The difficulty is in transferring the energy from the point of impact through the plate and sample to the cut edge. It is likely that not all of the kinetic energy is available for detaching the pool; some may be sequestered in weld pool oscillations. The coefficient of restitution for the collision will be lower than one if irreversible deformation, for example plastic flow deformation, takes place during the collision. Thus determining the amount of energy from an impact that actually reaches the molten metal droplet is critical. Various molten metal detachment scenarios were tested experimentally in an enclosed vacuum chamber using the Ukrainian Universal Hand Tool, an electron beam welder designed for space welding. The experimental testing was performed in a 4 ft. X 4 ft. vacuum chamber at Marshall Space Flight Center, evacuated to vacuum levels of at least 50 microTorr, and also some welding garment material was utilized to observe the effect of the molten metal detachments on the material. A "carillon" apparatus consisting of four pendulum hammer strikers, each weighing approximately 3. 65 lbs, raised to predetermined specific heights was used to apply an impact force to the weld sample/plate during electron beam welding and cutting exercises. The strikers were released by switching on an electric motor to rotate a pin holding wires retaining the strikers at desired heights. The specimens were suspended so as to be free to respond to the blows with a sudden velocity increment. The specimens were mounted on a hinged plate for minimizing effective mass with the option to fasten it down so as to raise its effective mass closer to that anticipated for an actual space welding scenario. Measurements were made of the impact energy and the horizontal fling distances of the detached metal drops. It was not particularly easy to generate the detachments for this experiment. This document presents the details of the theoretical modeling effort and a summary of the experimental effort to measure molten metal drop detachments from terrestrial electron beam welding in the enclosed vacuum chamber. The results of the experimental effort have shown that molten metal detachments can occur from the sample/weld plate only if a sufficiently large impact force is applied to the weld plate. A "weld pool detachment parameter" was determined to indicate whether detachment would occur. Detachment can be either full or partial (dripping), Partial detachment means that the weld pool detached from one side of the liquid-solid boundary so as to leave a hole at the puddle site but remained attached over part of the liquid-solid boundary and dripped down the plate with no fully detached material detected. Full detachment, however, does not necessarily mean that the whole pool fully detached; in some cases only a smaller portion of the pool detached, the remainder dripping down the plate. The weld pool detachment parameter according to theory and according to the empirical data allows a determination of whether full detachments might occur. Theoretical calculations indicated titanium alloy would be the most difficult from which to detach molten metal droplets followed by stainless steel and then by aluminum. The experimental results were for the most part consistent with the theoretical analysis and predictions. The above theory is applicable to other situations as desired for assessing the potential for molten metal detachments...|$|R
