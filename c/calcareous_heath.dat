5000|$|Cors Goch National Nature Reserve is principally a fen in {{a shallow}} valley {{near the village of}} Llanbedrgoch, on the eastern side of Anglesey. The site is managed by the North Wales Wildlife Trust and also {{includes}} <b>calcareous</b> <b>heath,</b> meadow and an acid heath overlain on millstone grit. There is some area of open water including Llyn Cadarn but much is marsh or shallow bog which supports a species rich ecosystem dominated by reeds. A number of rare plants and animals are able to flourish in this environment, including great crested newt and adders. The medicinal leech and glow worm have also been found here. The site is managed by the North Wales Wildlife Trust.|$|E

40|$|A key to conserving organisms is {{identification}} of the habitat bounds and essential resources within them. In population studies (metapopulations) of phytophagous arthropods it is tacitly assumed that habitat bounds portray short-term stability and that habitat is largely synonymous with hostplant areas or with a single vegetation unit comprising hostplants; structural components are usually ignored. We test these assumptions by monitoring the behaviour and relative abundance of Plebejus argus (L.) (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) in relation to changing weather conditions in two patches of a North Wales metapopulation for the butterfly. Our findings confirm the importance of structural habitat components. P. argus density is higher {{in the vicinity of}} shrubs which are used for roosting, resting, basking, mate location and shelter. A dominant proportion of the population adopts shrub areas in cooler, cloudy and windy weather. In warmer, sunnier and calmer conditions, the butterfly spends longer in flight and moves out onto <b>calcareous</b> <b>heath</b> dominated by hostplants. In doing so, an increasing, even dominant, proportion of the population occupies exposed slopes adjacent to and above shrub covered areas associated with the hostplant. In effect, the habitat bounds appear to change with conditions on scales of days and hours. What part of a landscape may be defined as a habitat, and what part of it may appear to be most important for an organism, depends on just when and where surveys are carried out. We argue that for correct delineation of habitats attention needs to be given to resource use in different conditions. In the face of enhanced global warming, a broad view should be taken of arthropod habitats that considers the resources required for varying conditions...|$|E

50|$|The Cheddar Complex {{supports}} {{a wide range}} of semi-natural habitats which includes unimproved grassland, <b>calcareous</b> dry dwarf-shrub <b>heath,</b> semi-natural broadleaved woodland and dense and scattered scrub. Four nationally rare plants are present, including Little Robin Geranium purpureum, Cheddar Pink Dianthus gratianopolitanus and Cheddar Bedstraw Galium fleurotii, two of which are endemic to the Cheddar area, as well as fifteen nationally scarce species.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{biennial}} or monocarpic perennial plant {{growing to}} 30 - 80 cm tall, with rough, hairy, oblanceolate leaves. The flowers start pink and turn vivid blue and are 15 - 20 mm in a branched spike, {{with all the}} stamens protruding. The pollen is blue but the filaments of the stamens remain red, contrasting against the blue flowers. It flowers between May and September. It is found in dry <b>calcareous</b> grassland and <b>heaths,</b> bare and waste places, along railways and roadsides, and on coastal cliffs, sand dunes and shingle.|$|R

40|$|There are policy {{pressures}} to make agriculture more environmentally sustainable {{and to give}} a more local expression to agri-environmental priorities. This paper considers these moves, with particular reference to the beef sector, and speculates on the further policy responses required to facilitate benign local agri-environmental management. The UK beef sector is characterized by its complexity and diversity but four major systems can be identified operating at varying levels of intensity. Of these, suckler herds and grass-rearing systems have long been associated with high natural value forms of agricultural land management. Many of the cherished habitats and landscapes of the UK are dependent upon grazing for their ecological and amenity value. However {{a combination of the}} BSE crisis, the strength of sterling and the recent Foot & Mouth epidemic threatens the sustainability of these high nature value grazing systems. The importance of grazing to fifty selected Sites of Special Scientific Interest is highlighted in the paper. Survey work identified a wide range of systems to be particularly vulnerable to changes in profitability in the beef sector, including: coastal grazing marsh, wet acidic grassland / marshland, upland moor and <b>heath,</b> <b>calcareous</b> grassland and neutral grassland. To maintain these systems requires agricultural policy to be more sensitive to local conditions than appears currently to be the case. There is little policy support for beef farmers in a regional context, still less giving special prominence to those farming within particular biotopes. Nor has there been sufficient policy encouragement to markets for traditional and local beef breeds. The continuing pressure for CAP reform offers further opportunity for policies to be devolved to regions and localities...|$|R
