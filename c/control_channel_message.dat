The proposed protocol uses the <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> in order to exchange information concerning the available data channels and also to establish communications.

This methodology allows nodes to become aware of the distribution of the load over the different channels and therefore to perform channel selection {{in such a way that}} channel congestion is avoided. Moreover, the proposed protocol specifies a mechanism which uses sorting based on channel weights with the goal of reducing the sensing effort whenever this is possible. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol is up to 80 % more efficient in terms of delay when compared to an algorithm that neglects the current load of channels and which allows nodes to randomly select one of the available channels.

An RTS/CTS handshaking scheme is employed for every channel before actual data transmission. In this scheme, CDMA spreading codes are distributed before hand by some predefined algorithm and every node is assumed to get a unique spreading code among its one-hop neighbors.|$|R
