25|$|The home {{field of}} the Tigers, Hanshin Koshien Stadium, {{is one of three}} major natural grass {{baseball}} stadiums in Japan. The others are the Mazda Stadium in Hiroshima (Hiroshima Toyo Carp), and Skymark Stadium in Kobe (part-time home of the Orix Buffaloes). Of the three, only Koshien has an all-dirt infield (the other two aforementioned parks have an American-style infield). There are numerous smaller grass field ballparks around the country; Japanese baseball teams frequently play games in small cities so that local fans <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> of their heroes.|$|E
500|$|The {{designers}} used graphic sliders in {{the game}} engine to {{determine the amount of}} water covering the streets. Like Seattle, rain is frequent {{in the game}}. The lighting effects (such as neon light from Delsin's powers) coupled with reflections help bring color into Seattle's dark and rainy atmosphere. Because of the move to the PS4, Sucker Punch were able to render more open world than what was possible in previous Infamous games.

2500|$|Like the Upland Tropical Rain Forest exhibit, {{this exhibit}} is {{structured}} {{like a large}} walk-in aviary, and allows many of the flying animals to roam freely throughout the exhibit. The exhibit represents a river gorge in Australia, and contains many pools in which Australian aquatic life can be found. [...] It is designed to show the wild extremes faced by this particular part of Australia: fire, drought and flood. Guests <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> than 1,800 individual native animals including freshwater crocodiles, turtles, free-flying birds, snakes, lizards, and flying foxes.|$|E
2500|$|The song is {{told from}} the point of view of someone contemplating life after death to their lover, as Asher describes, [...] "'I'll love you till the sun burns out, then I'm gone,' ergo 'I'm gonna love you forever.'" [...] Wilson {{explained}} that [...] "God Only Knows" [...] was [...] "a vision that Tony and I had. It's like being blind but in being blind, you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>more.</b> You close your eyes; you're able to see a place or something that's happening." [...] He initially hated the opening line of the song as [...] "it was too negative." [...] He eventually gave in after hearing the subsequent lyrics. In 1976, Brian said there was no one particular that the song was written for.|$|E
2500|$|The first week's panelists were Dawson, Michael Landon, Vicki Lawrence, Jack Klugman, Jo Ann Pflug, and Anita Gillette. Rayburn {{reassured}} {{viewers of}} the first CBS show that [...] "This is your old favorite, updated with more action, more money and, as you <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>more</b> celebrities." [...] The {{first few weeks of}} the show were somewhat {{different from the rest of}} the run. At first, many of the questions fit into the more bland and innocuous mold of the earlier seasons of the original series. In addition, many of the frequent panelists on the early episodes were not regulars later in the series but had appeared on the 1960s version, including Klugman, Arlene Francis, and Bert Convy, the last of whom was later chosen as host of the show's 1990 revival before being diagnosed with a brain tumor which eventually took his life.|$|E
