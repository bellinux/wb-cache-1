5|$|In 2011, astronomers {{found what}} {{they believe to be}} {{pristine}} <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium. Since the <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.|$|E

The series starts with the visualized <b>Cloud</b> <b>of</b> Sound, in which modern music (mostly commissioned works) is staged with lasers, video projections, fireworks, ships, cranes, balloons, etc. This concert attracts an audience of about 100,000. The classic <b>Cloud</b> <b>of</b> Sound is the opening concert of the Brucknerfest, performed without visualization. The children's <b>Cloud</b> <b>of</b> Sound, an afternoon event since 1998, provides musical stories for younger listeners.|$|R
5|$|Between 1980 and 1986, {{activity}} {{continued at}} Mount St. Helens, {{with a new}} lava dome forming in the crater. Numerous small explosions and dome-building eruptions occurred. From December 7, 1989, to January 6, 1990, and from November 5, 1990, to February 14, 1991, the mountain erupted with sometimes huge <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> ash.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the stars}} lies the {{interstellar}} medium, {{a region of}} sparse matter. In the densest regions, molecular <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> molecular hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the Jeans length) to form compact protostars.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus Spissatus {{clouds are}} the highest <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> the main cloud genera. They may form in the higher {{tropopause}} or even at the lower stratosphere.

The <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> vapor is measured using a yardstick or by a ruler on the wall next to the competitor. In Plano, Texas in 2015, the <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> vapor reached about 5 feet. The cloud was measured at 6 feet from another vaper. The judge Matt Maynard said, [...] "There is a skill to being able to keep a ball of vapor together without it dissipating." ...|$|R
5|$|Exocomets {{beyond the}} Solar System {{have also been}} {{detected}} and may be common in the Milky Way. The first exocomet system detected was around Beta Pictoris, a very young A-type main-sequence star, in 1987. A total of 10 such exocomet systems have been identified , using the absorption spectrum caused by the large <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> gas emitted by comets when passing close to their star.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the giant}} planets {{probably}} had accretion disks of their own, {{in the first}} meaning of the word. The <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> captured hydrogen and helium gas contracted, spun up, flattened, and deposited gas {{onto the surface of}} each giant protoplanet, while solid bodies within that disk accreted into the giant planet's regular moons.|$|E

The ink is thought to reduce the efficiency of olfactory organs, which would aid evasion from predators that employ smell for hunting, such as sharks. Ink <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> some species might act as pseudomorphs, or decoys that the predator attacks instead.|$|E
5|$|Spiral arms {{also have}} the ability to cause climatic changes on a planet. Passing through the dense {{molecular}} <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> galactic spiral arms, stellar winds may be pushed back to the point that a reflective hydrogen layer accumulates in an orbiting planet's atmosphere, perhaps leading to a snowball Earth scenario.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies, {{like the}} Milky Way, produce new generations of stars {{as long as}} they have dense {{molecular}} <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> interstellar hydrogen in their spiral arms. Elliptical galaxies are largely devoid of this gas, and so form few new stars. The supply of star-forming material is finite; once stars have converted the available supply of hydrogen into heavier elements, new star formation will come to an end.|$|E

5|$|A {{hierarchical}} structure of matter began to form from minute {{variations in the}} mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These massive stars triggered the reionization process and {{are believed to have}} created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa near Dakar on August 31. It moved westward into the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and organized into a tropical disturbance on September 2 with a small, circular area of convection. The system moved to the west, and on September 3, the convection diminished after moving west of 40° W. By the next day, the tropical disturbance was barely discernible from the <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The wave gradually became detached from the ITCZ, and based on a reconnaissance flight that confirmed the existence of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on September 5 while located 255 miles (415 km) east of Grenada.|$|E

5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} and dense <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk, proplyd, around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next10–100 million years.|$|E
5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 to the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. After a possible precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907. Between 1907 and 1914, plumes and <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> ash frequently rose out of the caldera, and at least a few of these events were explosive. On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air over 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a caldera nearly identical to the one in existence today.|$|E

However, there were difficulties in decision-making and wariness as the <b>clouds</b> <b>of</b> war loomed, most notably because of the company's contracts to supply a needy Soviet Union with machine tools, which had done much to assist it out of the depths of depression.|$|E
