50|$|On September 11, 2014 {{satellite}} operator SES announced the first Ultra HD conditional access-protected broadcast using DVB standards at the IBC show in Amsterdam. The demonstration used a Samsung Ultra HD TV, {{with a standard}} Kudelski SmarDTV CI Plus <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> <b>module,</b> to decrypt a full 3840x2160 pixel CAS-protected Ultra HD signal in HEVC broadcast via an SES Astra satellite at 19.2°E.|$|E
50|$|A <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> <b>module</b> (CAM) is an {{electronic}} device, usually incorporating a slot for a smart card, which equips an Integrated Digital Television or set-top {{box with the}} appropriate hardware facility to view conditional access content that has been encrypted using a conditional access system. They are normally used with direct-broadcast satellite (DBS) services, although digital terrestrial pay TV suppliers also use CAMs. PC Card form factor is used as the Common Interface form of Conditional Access Modules for DVB broadcasts.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] In {{this article}} we present a system for sharing a <b>Conditional</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Module</b> among {{different}} visualization devices. Current pay-TV systems require having conditional access modules and smart cards replicated at every visualization device willing to access Pay-TV contents. In this article, we show how a home gateway, capable of securely distribute decryption keys, home visualization devices, an inexpensive descrambler, and a home network, enable a flexible solution to access Pay-TV.

50|$|For {{applications}} where devices {{may fall}} into the physical possession of an adversary, protection against power analysis is generally a major design requirement. Power analyses have also been reportedly used against <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> <b>modules</b> used in pay television systems.|$|R
50|$|A few TV {{gateways}} {{also support}} third party <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> <b>modules</b> (CAMs) for premium pay TV channels, which are transmitted {{by using a}} CAM CI card provided by the broadcasters or by third party manufacturers to access their TV service.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{satellite}} TV industry {{relies heavily}} {{on the use of}} smart card technology {{at the very heart of}} broadcasted services that are protected by legacy <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> systems. The process of Satellite TV signal protection is distributed amongst a number of system components, e. g. smart cards, receivers, <b>Conditional</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Modules</b> (CAM) and the content provider. However, the introduction of “Open ” Satellite Receivers, providing a highly configurable environment with software emulation of <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> systems, enabled the implementation of whole range of new attacks. A widely deployed attack is often referred to as the “card sharing ” attack, by which one legitimate user colludes to provide protected content to a larger group of unauthorised users. This paper proposes a countermeasure that increases the bandwidth requirements of this attack to the point where it is no longer practical with a standard internet connection, with a minimal impact on existing protocols and architectures. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, Ziggo (now {{a part of}} Liberty Global) {{achieved}} two pay-TV firsts: {{delivery of}} interactive services such as VOD to STBs without built-in hardware, {{as well as to}} televisions equipped with CI Plus 1.3 <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> <b>modules,</b> without the need of a set-top box. The innovation eliminated the need for “extra equipment, extra leads or an extra remote control” and enabled a user experience that would be “exactly the same for all types of peripheral equipment.” In April 2014, Liberty Puerto Rico, a Liberty Global system, announced that it was using CloudTV to power Social Content Navigator, a user interface that uses viewing metrics to rank eight tiles of live video by program popularity. and underscores the value of the channel bundle by encouraging viewers to “go outside their comfort zone.” Videonet noted that Liberty Puerto Rico is running Social Content Navigator on single-tuner set-tops, and observed that such a service ordinarily would require “new STBs with more power and multiple tuners.” ...|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{unofficial}} third-party <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> software <b>modules</b> (CAMs or emulators) {{are widely}} circulated on the Internet that emulate the CA systems developed by NDS (VideoGuard), Irdeto, Conax, Nagravision, Viaccess and other proprietary vendors. Some Uni-box owners use these softcams {{in conjunction with}} card sharing software to access pay TV services without a subscription card inserted in every connected box. This practice may be illegal in some jurisdictions and third-party software for this purpose is neither officially endorsed nor supported by UNIDIS and voids the official warranty.|$|R
