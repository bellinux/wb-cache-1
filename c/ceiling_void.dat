50|$|A {{concealed}} {{fan coil}} unit will typically be installed within an accessible <b>ceiling</b> <b>void</b> or services zone. The return air grille and supply air diffuser, typically set flush into the ceiling, will be ducted {{to and from the}} {{fan coil unit}} and thus allows a great degree of flexibility for locating the grilles to suit the ceiling layout and/or the partition layout within a space. It is quite common for the return air not to be ducted and to use the <b>ceiling</b> <b>void</b> as a return air plenum.|$|E
50|$|Mixing systems {{generally}} {{supply air}} {{such that the}} supply air mixes with the room air so that the mixed air is at the room design temperature and humidity. In cooling mode, the cool supply air, typically around 55 °F (13 °C) (saturated) at design conditions, exits an outlet at high velocity. The high velocity supply air stream causes turbulence causing the room air to mix with the supply air. Because the entire room is near-fully mixed, temperature variations are small while the contaminant concentration is fairly uniform throughout the entire room. Diffusers are normally used as the air outlets to create the high velocity supply air stream. Most often, the air outlets and inlets are placed in the ceiling. Supply diffusers in the ceiling are fed by fan coil units in the <b>ceiling</b> <b>void</b> or by air handling units in a remote plant room. The fan coil or handling unit take in return air from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>void</b> and mix this with fresh air and cool, or heat it, as required to achieve the room design conditions. This arrangement is known as 'conventional room air distribution'.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{was designed to}} be triangular in shape because it would allow 20% more of the office area to enjoy the harbour view as compared with a square or rectangular shaped buildings. From an architectural point of view, this arrangement provides better floor area utilisation, offering an internal column-free office area with a clear depth of 9 to 13.4 m and an overall usable floor area efficiency of 81%.Nonetheless, the triangular building plan causes the air handling unit (AHU) room in the internal core to also assume a triangular configuration. With only limited space, this makes the adoption of a standard AHU not feasible. Furthermore, all air-conditioning ducting, electrical trunking and piping gathered inside the core area has to be squeezed into a very narrow and congested corridor <b>ceiling</b> <b>void.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{building}} services engineering and HVAC, a bell mouth is a tapered expanding or reducing {{opening in the}} end of a ventilation duct, so named because the taper can resemble that of a bell shape. They are primarily designed and used for return air or extract air purposes within building ventilation systems, more commonly located within <b>ceiling</b> <b>voids</b> or other similar plenum. The bellmouth cross sectional area is normally double that of the duct area, so that the air velocity entering the bellmouth is low (to reduce noise, turbulence and pressure drop), and gradually increases to the normal design velocity of the ductwork. The angle of the bellmouth is normally tapered at about 45° as a balance between keeping the bellmouth short without causing too much turbulence or excessive pressure drop. Bell mouths can be manufactured to suit either circular or rectangular ductwork sections.|$|R
50|$|As {{distinct}} from impact craters, these craters are not formed from the clashing of bodies or projectiles from space. Rather, {{they can be}} formed by a lava explosion from a bottled up volcano, (the explosion leaving a shallow caldera), or the <b>ceiling</b> over a <b>void</b> may not be solid enough to prevent {{the collapse of the}} overlying material. A pit crater also could result from the collapse of lava tubes, dike swarms, or from collapsed magma chambers under loose material.|$|R
50|$|Cenotes {{are formed}} by {{dissolution}} {{of rock and}} the resulting subsurface void, {{which may or may}} not be linked to an active cave system, and the subsequent structural collapse. Rock that falls into the water below is slowly removed by further dissolution, creating space for more collapse blocks. The rate of collapse increases during periods when the water table is below the <b>ceiling</b> of the <b>void,</b> since the rock ceiling is no longer buoyantly supported by the water in the void.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an object-based CAD {{programming}} {{is used to}} take advantage of  standardization to handle the schematic design, sizing, layout for services in a  building <b>ceiling</b> <b>void.</b> From the specification of the building 3 D model, our  software proceeds through different steps, from the determination of the  standard number and size of fan coils to the generation of 3 D solutions. In  {{order to deal with}} more complex geometry and larger problems, we have used  a hybrid approach: Case Based Reasoning (CBR) within Constraint  Satisfaction Problem (CSP) approaches. In practice, engineers in building  services use previous solutions and adapt them to new problems. CBR mirrors  this practical approach and does help us to deal with increasingly complex  geometry effectively, and meanwhile CSP has been used for layout adaptation.   The results have shown {{that it is possible to}} define and implement standard  solutions to produce designs comparable with current practice. The  benchmarking exercise has underlined many advantages and made some  suggestions for further development.

40|$|SUMMARY: In {{this paper}} an object-based CAD {{programming}} {{is used to}} take advantage of standardization to handle the schematic design, sizing and layout planning for ceiling mounted fan coil system in a building <b>ceiling</b> <b>void.</b> In order to deal with more complex geometry and real building size, we have used a hybrid approach combining case-based reasoning and constraint programming techniques. Very often, building services engineers use previous solutions and adapt them to new problems. Case-based reasoning mirrors this practical approach and did help us deal effectively with increasingly complex geometry. Our approach combines automation and interactivity. From the specification of the building 3 D BIM model, our software prototype proceeds through four steps. First, the user divides the building into zones, each zone being defined by a geometrical primitive (i. e. rectangle zone, triangle zone, curved zone, etc.). Next, for each zone a similar case is retrieved from the case library. The retrieval process will generate a first incomplete 3 D solution containing some inconsistencies. Next, the incomplete solution is adapted, using constraint programming techniques, to provide a consistent solution. Finally, distribution routes (i. e. ducts and pipes) are generated using constraint programming techniques. The 3 D fan coil solution can be modified or improved by the designer, whil...|$|E

50|$|While {{undergoing}} a $50 Million renovation, a {{fire broke out}} at around 10 a.m. on March 20, 2009. The fire {{was caused by a}} spark from a welder's torch which ignited grease in one of the kitchens. The subsequent fire spread rapidly. The casino was evacuated and fire crews attempted to contain the fire for several hours. The fire burned above the sprinkler systems reach in what are known as void spaces, inside walls and above hung <b>ceilings.</b> Inside the <b>void</b> spaces the fire was able to spread quickly and decimate the entire entertainment complex. It took {{a significant portion of the}} cities fire department several hours to bring the blaze under control. The fire resulted in no fatalities however two guest were transported to a nearby hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. While the gaming complex itself was untouched by the fire the entire entertainment area was a total loss. The roof collapsed on the kitchen and ballroom area taking with it one of the large pyramid structures that sat atop the roof.|$|R
40|$|At 8. 18 pm on 2 September 1998, Swissair Flight 111 (SR 111), {{took off}} from New York’s JFK airport bound for Geneva, Switzerland. Tragically, the MD- 11 {{aircraft}} never arrived. According to the crash investigation report, published on 27 March 2003, electrical arcing in the <b>ceiling</b> <b>void</b> cabling was the most likely cause of the fire that brought down the aircraft. No one on board {{was aware of the}} disaster unfolding in the ceiling of the aircraft and, when a strange odour entered the cockpit, the pilots thought it was a problem with the air-conditioning system. Twenty minutes later, Swissair Flight 111 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean five nautical miles southwest of Peggy’s Cove, Nova Scotia, with the loss of all 229 lives on board. In this paper, the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of the in-flight fire that brought down SR 111 is described. Reconstruction of the wreckage disclosed that the fire pattern was extensive and complex in nature. The fire damage created significant challenges to identify the origin of the fire and to appropriately explain the heat damage observed. The SMARTFIRE CFD software was used to predict the “possible” behaviour of airflow as well as the spread of fire and smoke within SR 111. The main aims of the CFD analysis were to develop {{a better understanding of the}} possible effects, or lack thereof, of numerous variables relating to the in-flight fire. Possible fire and smoke spread scenarios were studied to see what the associated outcomes would be. This assisted investigators at Transportation Safety Board (TSB) of Canada, Fire & Explosion Group in assessing fire dynamics for cause and origin determination...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSoil subsidence/collapse {{is a major}} {{geohazard}} {{occurring in}} karst region. It occurs as suffosion or dropout sinkholes developing in the soft cover. Less frequently it corresponds to a breakdown of karst <b>void</b> <b>ceiling</b> (i. e. collapse sinkhole). This hazard can cause significant engineering challenges. Therefore decision-makers require the elaboration of methodologies for reliable predictions of such hazards (e. g., karst subsidence susceptibility and hazards maps, early-warning monitoring systems). A methodological framework was developed to evaluate relevant conditioning factors favouring subsidence (Perrin et al. submitted) and then to combine these factors to produce karst subsidence susceptibility maps. This approach was applied to a mantled karst area south of Paris (Val d'Orléans). Results show the significant roles of the overburden lithology (presence/absence of low-permeability layer) and of the karst aquifer piezometric surface position within the overburden. In parallel, an experimental site has been setup to improve the understanding of key processes leading to subsidence/collapse and includes piezometers for measurements of water levels and physico-chemical parameters in both the alluvial and karst aquifers as well as surface deformation monitoring. Results should help in designing monitoring systems to anticipate occurrence of subsidence/collaps...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSoil subsidence/collapse {{is a major}} {{geohazard}} {{occurring in}} karst regions. It occurs as suffosion or dropout sinkholes developing in the overburden overlying karst. Less frequently it corresponds to a breakdown of karst <b>void</b> <b>ceiling</b> (i. e., collapse sinkhole). This hazard can cause significant engineering challenges. Therefore decision-makers require the elaboration of methodologies for reliable predictions of such hazards (e. g., karst subsidence susceptibility and hazards maps, planning strategies, priority areas for detailed investigations). This study aims at developing a methodological framework {{for the evaluation of}} potential conditioning factors controlling the occurrence of sinkholes in a context of limestone karst: potential conditioning factors are first determined based on underlying physical processes for different geological contexts (barren and mantled karsts). Then the relevance of each factor is evaluated against a set of representative karst subsidence locations using the weight-of-evidence theory and relevant factors are tested for independence. Relevant and independent factors are finally weighed and combined together (i. e., superimposed) to achieve karst subsidence susceptibility models. The best model (i. e., the one showing the highest predictability) is determined by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, which is performed using a set of independent and representative karst subsidence locations. The method is applied to one case study where mantled karst setting prevails (Val d'Orléans, south of Paris). Results show higher susceptibility in mantled karst with significant role of the overburden lithology (presence/absence of low-permeability layer) and position of the karst piezometric surface within the overburden. The limited area of barren karst shows a low susceptibility. Although this approach was developed for a specific karst context, it can easily be replicated in other karst contexts (e. g., interstratal karst, chalk or evaporitic karsts) which are known to be highly susceptible to karst subsidence even if some of the conditioning factors will be different...|$|R
