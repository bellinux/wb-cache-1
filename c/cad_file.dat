40|$|This Comment {{analyzes}} the regulations {{in place on}} 3 D-printed firearms and proposes a new standard for regulating 3 D-printed goods. Part I provides a brief primer on 3 D printing and 3 D-printed firearms. Part II turns to the events surrounding Defense Distributed’s creation of the world’s first 3 D-printed firearm and the subsequent government censorship of the corresponding <b>CAD</b> <b>files.</b> Part III discusses the regulations affecting 3 D-printed firearms and why these regulations are ill-suited for <b>CAD</b> <b>files</b> and 3 D-printed goods. Part IV {{analyzes the}} implications of treating <b>CAD</b> <b>files</b> and 3 D-printed goods as equivalents of traditional goods. Finally, Part V offers {{a proposal for a}} new standard of regulating 3 D-printed goods inspired by Sony Betamax’s “substantial noninfringing uses” 12 standard. Ultimately, this Comment recommends treating <b>CAD</b> <b>files</b> as expressive free speech and suggests logically examining the potential uses of new technologies in order to allow for the organic development of emerging goods and technologies.

50|$|Selective Laser Melting (also {{known as}} Powder Bed Fusion) is an {{additive}} manufacturing procedure {{used to create}} intricately detailed forms from a <b>CAD</b> <b>file.</b> In CAD, a shape is designed and then converted into slices. These slices are sent to a laser writer to print the final product. In brief, a bed of metal powder is prepared, and the first slice of the CAD design is formed in the powder bed by a high energy laser sintering the particles together. After this first slice is generated, the powder bed moves downwards, and a new batch of metal powder is rolled {{over the top of}} the slice. The second layer is then sintered with the laser, and the process is repeated until all the slices in the <b>CAD</b> <b>file</b> have been processed.|$|E

The laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning cross-sections generated from a 3-D digital description of the part (for example from a <b>CAD</b> <b>file</b> or scan data) on the surface of a powder bed. After each cross-section is scanned, the powder bed is lowered by one layer thickness, a new layer of material is applied on top, and the process is repeated until the part is completed.|$|E
