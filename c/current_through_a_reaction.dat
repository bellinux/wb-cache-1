When the {{galvanometer}} connexion {{with the}} axis was broken, and its wires made fast to two conductors, both {{applied to the}} edge of the copper disc, then currents of electricity were produced, presenting more complicated appearances, but in perfect harmony with the above results. Thus, if applied as in fig. 11, <b>a</b> <b>current</b> of electricity <b>through</b> the galvanometer was produced; but if their place was a little shifted, as in fig. 12, a current in the contrary direction resulted; the fact being, that in the first instance the galvanometer indicated the difference between <b>a</b> strong <b>current</b> <b>through</b> <b>A</b> and <b>a</b> weak one <b>through</b> B, and in the second, of <b>a</b> weak <b>current</b> <b>through</b> <b>A</b> and <b>a</b> strong one <b>through</b> B (92.), and therefore produced opposite deflections.|$|R
