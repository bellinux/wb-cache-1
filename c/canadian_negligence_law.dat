40|$|This article {{examines}} a feminist argument concerning the gendered structure of tort law in which interests {{that can be}} identified as gendered are subject to different levels of recognition resulting from gender bias. Using a comparative methodology, the article contends that <b>negligence</b> <b>law</b> regarding pure-economic loss and indirect-emotional harm is constructed along lines of gender bias. The argument is underlined by the notion of gender-related interests, establishing pure-economic loss as male-related and indirect-emotional harm as female-related. On its first comparative analysis, {{the similarities and differences}} between these two harms as perceived by tort conventions and principles should have yielded leverage to indirect-emotional harm as fitting more squarely with tort law’s fundamental conceptions than its counterpart, pure-economic loss. However, the course of legal recognition both harms have undergone in Anglo-American <b>negligence</b> <b>law</b> reveals that both losses were relatively similarly alienated from <b>negligence</b> <b>law.</b> Seeking further resources from which to draw on the significance of the gendered nature of these interests within <b>negligence</b> <b>law,</b> the article then proceeds to its second comparative dimension. Here it reviews Israeli <b>negligence</b> <b>law,</b> where indirect-emotional harm and economic loss function as legal implantations imported from Anglo-American law. Notwithstanding its deepest Anglo-American legal roots, Israeli <b>negligence</b> <b>law,</b> nonetheless, reveals a sharp departure in its adjudication on the matter from the Anglo-American tradition. Probing deeper into Israeli tort law, illuminates a unique phenomenon whereby the rhetoric of the court attributes the same relative-illegitimacy to both economic loss and indirect-emotional harm. However, reality indicates they are subject to significantly different treatment. This biased pattern bears harmful distributive implications as it embodies a two-dimension discrimination practice whereby in addition to disadvantaging female related interests, <b>negligence</b> <b>law</b> unequally prefers male-related interests. Specific attention is given in the article to the comparative phenomenon whereby the Israeli legal system that draws so heavily on dominant Anglo-American <b>law</b> administers <b>negligence</b> <b>law</b> upon more discriminatory standards thereby reflecting the gendered nature of Anglo-American <b>negligence</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{concerns}} {{the problem of}} factual uncertainty in <b>negligence</b> <b>law.</b> We argue that <b>negligence</b> <b>law</b> 2 ̆ 7 s insistence that fair terms of interaction be maintained between individuals [...] a requirement that typically manifests itself in {{the need for the}} plaintiff to prove factual or 2 ̆ 2 but-for 2 ̆ 2 causation [...] sometimes allows for the imposition of liability in the absence of such proof. In particular, we argue that the but-for requirement can be abandoned in certain situations where multiple defendants have imposed the same unreasonable risk on a plaintiff, where the plaintiff suffers the very sort of harm that rendered the risk unreasonable, and where the plaintiff cannot prove which of the defendants was the but-for cause of her loss. This approach provides one way to understand the Supreme Court of Canada 2 ̆ 7 s recent decision in Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke. We find support for our approach in various concepts that underlie negligence liability quite generally. These underlying concepts are normative in nature, and manifest core notions of justice and fairness. We argue that approaches to the problem of factual uncertainty that appeal to such normative principles to make sense of atypical cases of causation are in no way inconsistent with the nature and structure of <b>negligence</b> <b>law.</b> Rather, the opposite is true: in taking <b>negligence</b> <b>law</b> seriously as law, such approaches are instead reflective and supportive of it...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{responds}} to Benjamin Zipursky’s Reasonableness {{in and out}} of <b>Negligence</b> <b>Law</b> 163 U. PA. L. REV. 2131 (2015). It takes issue with Professor Zipursky’s aversion to the Hand Formula. Trying to write the Hand Formula out of <b>negligence</b> <b>law</b> at this late date is tantamount to repudiating one hundred years of tort law and theory. This revisionary theorizing is as unnecessary as it is quixotic. The Hand Formula is not only too deeply embedded in <b>negligence</b> <b>law</b> to uproot; it is also unobjectionable. Indeed, the Hand Formula is one of modern <b>negligence</b> <b>law’s</b> more important achievements. It frees the concept of due care from a disturbing identification with customary practice and ties due care more closely to the idea of justified conduct. By doing so, it gives <b>negligence</b> <b>law</b> an important critical dimension. The Hand Formula draws its appeal from two sources. First, it is an exemplary instance of a court distilling the implicit essence of a body of case law. Second, the considerations that it distills are plainly relevant to determining whether due care has been exercised. If there were no Hand Formula, we would have to invent one. To be sure, Professor Zipursky is justifiably allergic to the economic interpretation of the Hand Formula. The economic interpretation goes well beyond the Hand Formula to impose a questionable theory of social choice on a conceptual tool. In so doing, the economic interpretation makes claims about the commensurability of harms and the cost of their avoidance that Hand himself explicitly rejected. It is important, therefore, not to identify the Hand Formula with its economic interpretation. And it is equally important to recognize that Hand Formula’s most important achievement is not to anticipate or incarnate an economic idea of negligence, but to disentangle the care that people owe one another when they impose risks of physical harm from the care that they happen to take...|$|R

40|$|In <b>negligence</b> <b>law,</b> "unavoidable accident" is {{the risk}} that remains when an actor has used due care. The {{counterpart}} of unavoidable accident is "negligent harm. " <b>Negligence</b> <b>law</b> makes parties immune for unavoidable accident even when they have used less than due care. Courts have developed a number of methods by which they "sort" accidents to unavoidable accident or to negligent harm, holding parties liable only for the latter. These sorting techniques are interesting {{in their own right}} and also provide a way of conceptualizing the relationship between specific negligence and res ipsa loquitur, which are two variants of the negligence rule. One judicial sorting technique reveals a paradox of <b>negligence</b> <b>law.</b> New safety technology often reduces the amount of unavoidable accident and simultaneously increases the expected number of "compliance errors," or routine negligent lapses, that actors will make. Paradoxically, an actor's use of new safety technology can make it more likely that a court will sort an accident to negligent harm as opposed to unavoidable accident.

However, this case is not representative of all instances of negligence. In some cases, the negligent injurer failed in balancing between the interests of the victim alone; in other cases, he failed in balancing between the victim 2 ̆ 7 s interests and those of a third party; sometimes the injurer failed in balancing the victim 2 ̆ 7 s interests and the interests of the public or of society as a whole; and in yet other instances, he failed in balancing between his own interests. This article argues that the law should not treat in the same manner the different types of instances of failure in balancing between interests. Both justice and deterrence considerations mandate different treatment for the different types of instances, in accordance with the type of interests that the negligent injurer failed to balance. The article focuses on the typical types of balances of interests that the potential injurer is required to conduct before taking action, with the aim of determining the degree to which it is crucial to impose tort liability in each type of case. The article also examines whether prevailing <b>negligence</b> <b>law</b> is compatible with the thesis developed in the article and proposes tools for achieving such compatibility...|$|R
40|$|Thanks to Richard Posner 2 ̆ 7 s classic 1972 article, A Theory of <b>Negligence</b> <b>Law,</b> the Hand {{formula of}} United States. v. Carroll Towing Co. {{is perhaps the}} most central idea of many first-year torts classes today. Students learn that the meaning of {{negligence}} should be understood in terms of Judge Learned Hand 2 ̆ 7 s formula comparing the costs of taking precautions with the product of the likelihood of injury without those precautions and the magnitude of such injury. There is more than a little irony, however, in the superstar status of the Hand formula in <b>negligence</b> <b>law.</b> Carroll Towing is not a negligence case at all; indeed, it is not even a tort case, but an admiralty case. Beyond that, even the very general idea of a negligent injurer being held liable for the injuries it caused is not implicated in Carroll Towing, because it is about plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s fault, not defendant 2 ̆ 7 s fault. Posner 2 ̆ 7 s elevation of this formula to the apex of negligence doctrine is, though utterly sincere, nevertheless a sleight of Hand. This article puts aside the moral and evaluative arguments that frequently divide tort theorists, and instead gathers overwhelming evidence within <b>negligence</b> <b>law</b> that the Hand formula - in both its economic and its non-economic versions - simply misses the meaning of negligence within negligence doctrine. Negligence is a failure to use ordinary care. Ordinary care is that which a reasonably prudent person would use under the circumstances. While hardly self-evident or precise, concepts of ordinary care and the reasonably prudent person connote a standard of conduct that our negligence doctrine requires jurors and judges to apply as well as they can. There is every reason to believe this meaning is something quite different from the Hand formula (even if the two ideas should sometimes overlap). An accurate account of the meaning of negligence is a necessary starting point for questions or interpretation, criticism, and revision of tort doctrine. Finally, the article canvasses and rejects rights-based, conventionalistic, and virtue-based theories of the meaning of negligence, and begins to sketch an account according to which the reasonably prudent person is conceived in terms of a special kind of competency in civil life...|$|R
