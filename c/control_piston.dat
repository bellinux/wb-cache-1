The injector was developed for a marine medium-speed diesel engine. The dynamic response {{from the start of the}} control signal to the end of the needle valve closing were investigated. Firstly, a complete and detailed model of the electronic fuel injector was built and integrated into an optimisation model, where a MOGA was applied.

40|$|A set of {{experiments}} and a simulation study are completed {{to quantify the}} effect of the piston crevice on engine efficiency. The simulation study breaks down the loss mechanisms on brake efficiency at different displacement volumes (300 - 500 cc) and compression ratios (8 - 20). Experiments focus on indicated efficiencies for a narrow range of compression ratios (9. 24 - 12. 57) with different piston crevice volumes. Piston crevice volume is increased in two steps by machining a groove into the piston top land, and is decreased by raising the top ring. Indicated efficiency is measured at various loads (0. 4 - 1. 0 bar MAP), speeds (1500, 2000, 2500 rpm), and coolant temperatures (50 °C and 80 °C). All data points compared in this study are recorded at MBT timing with a relative air-fuel ratio ([gamma]) of 1. For the baseline case (CR = 9. 24, speed = 2000 rpm, coolant = 80 °C), increased crevice volume results in an indicated efficiency degradation of 0. 3 - 0. 5 %-points per 1000 mm 3. This absolute decrease corresponds to a 1. 2 - 1. 5 % relative decrease for a 100 % increase in crevice volume; referenced to the <b>control</b> <b>piston</b> crevice modification. Decreasing crevice volume leads to a gain in indicated efficiency of 2. 3 - 3. 5 %-points per 1000 mm 3, which corresponds to a 6. 9 - 11. 8 % relative increase for a 100 % decrease in crevice volume; referenced to the <b>control</b> <b>piston</b> crevice modification. Results of the experimental investigation, when compared across compression ratio, engine speed, and coolant temperature, show that the crevice effect on efficiency is largely independent of these three parameters. Large gains from decreased piston crevice volume prompt renewed discussions on piston top land, top ring, and crown design. by Patrick M. Smith. Thesis: S.

40|$|Alinear optical {{displacement}} sensorwas {{designed to}} overcome the problems related to the sensitivity of traditional transducers to electromagnetic disturbance, when applied to the measurement of needle lift in electrically actuated Diesel fuel injectors. The sensor consisted of a laser light emitter, a receiver, and a device used for modulating {{the intensity of the}} light reaching the receiver in function of position of the moving element. Thus, two rectangular windows were mounted on the injector body, while a third window was rigidly connected to the needle <b>control</b> <b>piston,</b> and aligned with the fixed ones, to obtain a clearance area which varied linearly with needle position. An optical fibre cable was used to transfer the laser light from the source to one of the fixed window, while a similar cable was connected between the second window and the receiver. Hence, the intensity of the light reaching the receiver was proportional to the position of the injector needle. Light intensity was converted into an equivalent voltage, and this signal was fed to the data acquisition system. The injector needle lift curves were measured and compared with those obtained with a commercial eddy current sensor. The reliability of the sensor was further improved by designing a suitable gasket that prevented fuel oil from reaching the optical windows, thus avoiding the onset of fluid cavitation, which would have resulted in bubble formation and consequent random laser light scattering, hence measurement alteratio...|$|E

Candidate actuators were designed and tested that fall into the categories of "hard" and "soft," depending on the offload spring stiffness relative to the PSA structural stiffness. Dynamics models for each type of actuator are presented, which respectively use piezo-electric transducers and voice coils.

The analysis is presented for a single PSA on a rigid base, and then using Zernike approximations the analysis is repeated for 492 mirror segments on a flexible mirror cell. Servo requirements include low-frequency stiffness, needed for wind rejection; reduced control structure interaction, specified by a bound on the sensitivity function; and mid-frequency damping, needed to reduce vibration transmission. The last of these requirements, vibration reduction, was found to be an important distinguishing characteristic for actuator selection.

40|$|Variable {{displacement}} pumps {{are often used}} in both industrial applications and mobile hydraulic machinery. In such pumps, flow rate is dictated by the system requirements. Mathematical model has been previously developed to simulate the dynamic performance of the electrically controlled constant power regulated swash plate axial piston pumps with conical cylinder blocks. The pump is currently equipped with a double negative feedback control loop with an inner control loop to control the position of proportional valve using PID controller. Consequently, the proportional valve distributes the control pressure across {{the two sides of}} a <b>control</b> <b>piston</b> that is mechanically attached to the pump swash plate in order to change the pump flow rate.

40|$|A new semifree-piston rotary {{generator}} {{concept is}} modelled dynamically and {{reduced to a}} single equation for piston stroke motion. This new concept comprises a toroidal-segment piston and cylinder, which orbit on separate generator disks, coupled {{by a pair of}} torsion springs to form a balanced mass-elastic system capable of spin. Conventional cyclic combustion takes place in the cylinder causing resonant motion of the disks. A two-part control strategy is proposed and tested by simulation to address the multi-objectives of maximum mechanical power transfer, minimum peak generator torque, and accurate piston top dead center (TDC) position control. A Part I strategy initially assumes that the combustion gas pressure is a function of time only. This produces torque control that follows a stroke velocity feedback law, which maximizes power transfer and implicitly minimizes generator torque, {{at the same time as}} power generation. When stroke-dependent gas pressure is introduced, however, the Part I strategy creates an unstable self-excited nonlinear system. The Part II strategy is designed to <b>control</b> <b>piston</b> TDC position and stabilize the response. This uses proportional control of gas pressure rise, assumed possible through fuel injection control and in-cylinder pressure sensing. An ideal-air-standard-dual-combustion two-stroke cycle is then adopted for nonstochastic simulation purposes, excluding the effect of delays and coupled system dynamics. A study is undertaken of a nominal 1. 42 l, 200 mm orbit-radius, constant-pressure-scavenged diesel design with three different spring stiffness values. By focusing near the minimum compression ratio for diesel, to give a lower bound on the possible ideal output power, control gains are found that produce stable motion with piston TDC position errors of less than 1 %. The power range is from 16 kW to 336 kW, depending mainly on spring stiffness. Since the concept can also store significant kinetic energy, it is potentially attractive as a range-extender for electric vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Pumps {{are often}} used in both {{industrial}} applications and mobile hydraulic machinery. In variable displacement pumps, the flow rate is dictated by the system requirements. The electro-hydraulic pump is a new integrated product, which comprise {{the combination of a}} pump and motor as a unit replacing the traditional connection with a shaft coupling. The pump is actuated without a rotating shaft utilizing a piston pump embedded in the motor. This brings with it some added advantages such as easy installation, reduction of noise in the system and decrease in power loss. In operation, the piston pump body is placed in the motor rotor, the air gap between the rotor and motor stator is filled with hydraulic oil, the rotor is directly rotated in the hydraulic oil and the control of the pressure and flow is achieved by means of the mechanical adjustment at the pressure valve. Electro-hydraulic systems with volumetric control offer a lot of advantages for pumping, due to the use of axial pistons with variable displacements possibilities. Several researchers have tried to describe the performance structure of these pumps in relation to efficiency; energy loss etc. without needed success. Previous studies have shown that using single loop suppress the steady state vibration, causes relatively good valve performance and reduces the impact on the <b>control</b> <b>piston</b> at the ends of a system’s strokes.

40|$|Condition Monitoring is an {{area that}} has seen {{substantial}} growth in the last few decades. The purpose for implementing condition monitoring in industry is to increase productivity, decrease maintenance costs and increase safety. Therefore, condition monitoring can be used not only for planning maintenance but also for allowing the selection of the most efficient equipment to minimize operating costs. Hydraulic systems are widely used in industry, aerospace and agriculture and are becoming more complex in construction and in function. Reliability of the systems must be supported by an efficient maintenance scheme. Due to component wear or failure, some system parameters may change causing abnormal behaviour in each component or in the overall circuit. Research in this area has been substantial, and includes specialized studies on artificial fault simulation at the University of Saskatchewan. In this research, an axial pump was the focus of the study. In an axial piston pump, wear between the various faces of components can occur {{in many parts of the}} unit. As a consequence, leakage can occur in locations such as between the valve plate and barrel, the drive shaft and oil wiper, the <b>control</b> <b>piston</b> and piston guide, and the swash plate and slippers. In this study, wear (and hence leakage) between the pistons and cylinder bores in the barrel was of interest. Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan, as well as at other research institutions, have been involved in studies to detect wear in pumps using a variety of condition monitoring algorithms. However, to verify the reliability and indeed, limitations of some of the approaches, it is necessary to test the algorithms on systems with “real” leakage. To introduce actual wear in the piston of pumps can be very difficult and very expensive. Hence, introducing piston wear in an “artificial” manner would be of great benefit in the evaluation of various condition monitoring techniques. Since leakage is a direct consequence of piston wear, it is logical to conclude that varying the leakage in some prescribed manner can be used to artificially simulate wear. A prime concern, therefore, is to be able to precisely understand the dynamic relationships between the wear and leakage and the effect it has on the output flow or pressure waveform from the pump. Introducing an artificial leakage to simulate the wear of pistons is a complex task. The creation of an artificial leakage path was not simply a process of providing a resistive short to the tank at the outlet of the pump port as was done in other studies. The objective was to create a leakage environment that would simulate leakage from a single piston (or combination of several pistons thereof). The complexity of the flow and pressure ripple waveforms (which various condition monitoring algorithms did require) was such that a more comprehensive leakage behaviour had to be modeled and experimentally created. A pressure control servo valve with a very high frequency response was employed to divert the flow from the pump outlet with a prescribed waveform directly to the tank to simulate the piston leakage from the high pressure discharge chamber to the pump case drain chamber as the simulated worn piston made contact with the high pressure chamber. The control algorithm could mimic the action of a single worn piston at various degrees of wear. The experimental results indicated that the experimental system could successfully introduce artificial leakage into the pump which was quite consistent with a unit with a “real” worn piston. Comparisons of the pressure ripples from an actual faulty pump (worn piston) and the “artificial” faulty pump (artificial leakage) are presented...|$|E
