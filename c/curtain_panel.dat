40|$|AbstractTo achieve {{national}} {{greenhouse gas}} {{reduction in the}} building sector, heating and cooling energy in buildings should be reduced. The government has strengthened regulations on insulation performance for building energy savings. However, the building envelope has various thermal bridges. In particular, a metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall comprises a number of thermal bridges at joints between the panels and the fixing units, thus degrading the overall thermal performance. To reduce building energy, {{it is necessary to}} reduce thermal bridges in building envelopes. This study aims to analyze the energy saving potential achieved by reducing thermal bridges. For this, the insulation performance and building energy needs of the existing and alternative metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall were evaluated. The alternative metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall that uses plastic molds at joints between panels and the thermally-broken brackets was suggested to reduce heat loss through thermal bridges. As results, the effective U-value of the alternative metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall was reduced by 72 % compared with the existing metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall. In addition, annual heating energy needs of the alternative metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall building was reduced by 26 %, and annual total energy needs was reduced by 6 % because annual cooling energy needs of it slightly increased compared with the existing metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall. In conclusion, the alternative metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall considerably influenced the savings in building energy needs by reducing thermal bridges...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo reduce energy {{consumption}} in buildings, {{it is essential}} to enhance the thermal insulation performance of building envelopes. For metal-exterior <b>curtain</b> wall <b>panel</b> systems, thermal insulation performance cannot be ensured because of the additional heat loss through thermal bridges, such as joints between panels, metal screws, and brackets. This study examined thermally improved metal-exterior <b>curtain</b> wall <b>panel</b> systems with bracket fixings. The thermal insulation performance of a conventional panel and three alternatives were evaluated by conducting three-dimensional transient heat transfer simulations during winter. The results showed that the total heat loss from the Base, alternative 1 (Alt 1), alternative 2 (Alt 2), and alternative 3 (Alt 3) systems were 120. 4, 62. 0, 34. 2, and 20. 3 MJ per unit wall area, respectively. Alt 3 reduced the heat loss by 83. 2 % compared with the Base.

The main phases involved are research, energy analysis, CFD simulations, and lab testing. The first part of the project entailed research in the data center field. This included attending two lectures provided by Cisco, visiting the annual Silicon Valley Data Center Energy Efficiency Summit hosted by Network Appliance, going on many data center tours, and taking a 3 -day 6 Sigma CFD training class. Next, the 1 st Law of Thermodynamics was applied to the CRAH (computer room air handler) unit as a preliminary analysis in order to gain insight on the air handler’s performance. Over winter quarter, HVAC equipment performance data was collected in order to develop numerical models for a chiller, CRAH unit, cooling tower, and water pumps using Engineering Equation Solver software. The models calculated the power requirements and efficiencies of this equipment over varying parameters. These parameters include flow rates due to variable frequency drives (VFDs) on the water pumps and CRAH units, chilled water temperature, outdoor air temperature, and lab room temperature. Once the individual equipment models were complete, they were integrated into a single, system level model for optimizing all parameters toward best energy efficiency of the system. Another area of the project was implementing and testing cold aisle containment on a CFD model of Lab C.

40|$|Between 1945 and 1961 Eero Saarinen molded {{the image}} of the modern American {{corporation}} in the postwar suburbs, in five office and research complexes built for General Motors, IBM, Bell Laboratories and Deere 2 ̆ 6 Company. These projects represent an architectural shift away from the hegemony of the International Style, in favor of client- and site-specific forms, designed and promoted as part of elaborate corporate image campaigns. Examined within the context of postwar decentralization, these projects reveal the role of large bureaucratic corporations in manipulating the form of the contemporary American landscape. Beginning in the late 1930 s and continuing through the 1950 s, American corporations, such as General Motors, promoted the suburbs to the consumer public as a landscape of progress—as the next frontier of American civilization. Through popular exhibitions, such as the Futurama pavilion at the 1939 World 2 ̆ 7 s Fair, GM created in the minds of Americans a technological image of the suburban landscape, built with the fruits of scientific research and wholly dependent on the automobile. Then, GM and other interested corporations promoted the construction of a national system of highways throughout the 1940 s, and began building in the suburbs as soon as World War II ended. In the projects examined here, Eero Saarinen translated the future-oriented pre-war rhetoric of the suburbs into architectural form through the use of new, mass-produced and flexible materials. From porcelain enameled <b>curtain</b> wall <b>panels,</b> neoprene window gaskets, reflective glazing and the first architectural use of Cor-Ten steel, the technological innovations of these projects contributed to an advanced building industry. Culturally, the innovative materials and forms served as progressive icons of the nascent American suburbs.

They developed a transitory commercial landscape and spurred a rising chorus of critics opposed to the tactics of big business and the effects of the suburbs. ...|$|R

Unitized {{curtain wall}} {{systems have been}} widely seen on {{high-rise}} buildings’ façades by bringing benefits with regard to ease of construction, lightness, etc. However, some design and application problems related to structural and infiltration performance of a façade system might arise during its lifetime, which is difficult for the building to compensate. Therefore, tests related to building façade system performance are of importance for assuring the comfort requirements and reducing the maintenance and repair costs as well as preventing the potential problems which may be faced during building’s lifetime. Full-scale preconstruction curtain wall mock-up testing is today normally considered a standard practice for buildings where the curtain wall is a custom application for high-rise buildings, and for buildings where a high confidence level is desired. Within {{the scope of this}} work, real time and full-scale performance tests in accordance with the load-bearing and impermeability criteria are performed on an outdoor test rig for a unitized glass <b>curtain</b> wall <b>panel</b> which is mostly applied on high-rise buildings. The study is based on the principle of the determination of performance change depending on wind pressure increase in upper stories of high-rise buildings and the variations of climatic conditions during the building’s lifetime. Full-scale mock-up testing of two identical unitized <b>curtain</b> wall <b>panels</b> was carried out. During the testing process, one specimen was subjected to a prescribed fatigue process before conducting the standard test procedures while only the standard test procedures were applied on the other identical specimen. In total, six test sequences were conducted on the reference Specimen P and fatigued Specimen FP. The categories of the tests for P are air infiltration, water penetration under static pressure, wind resistance, seismic resistance as the standard tests. Water penetration under dynamic pressure tests and fatigue procedure were the additional tests for FP along with the standard tests. After each test sequence, quantitative results were determined and checked whether the limit values of the related standards were exceeded. Various experimental behavioral parameters of the two panels are presented with graphics. This thesis consists of six Chapters: In Chapter 1, the aim, scope, method and motivation for this study are given. The existing curtain wall systems are classified and general information was given considering the systems and the components in Chapter 2. Afterwards, minimum performance requirements to compensate the load-bearing and impermeability criteria are explained. Additionally, information regarding the unitized panel systems in particular is presented. Chapter 3 is the main chapter of the thesis and comprises of the testing sequence, full-scale experimental study, and quantitative test results. In Chapter 4, a numerical performance evaluation study is performed by using the experimental data obtained from the experimental study. Widely used numerical methods such as AHP, COPRAS, and TOPSIS were selected for the performance evaluation of the standard and fatigue tested panels by taking into account of multi-criteria as load-bearing and impermeability. With the help of these evaluation methods, comparative lifetime performances of the tested panels were obtained and critical level of the tested panels denoting the loss of performance was found. A general summary and evaluation of the thesis is given in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 presents the results obtained from the experimental work and also includes the suggested potential future studies for fulfilling the topic covered in this thesis. The experimental study was carried out on a large test rig located at the Façade Testing Institute, at Çatalca. Air infiltration, static and dynamic penetration, resistance to wind load, seismic resistance and fatigue test procedures were conducted for the full scale façade specimens. The test specimens consist of two identically detailed unitized curtain wall systems with 2, 40 m width, 4, 45 m height dimensions, and are comprised of aluminum framing members and insulating glass units. In total, 10 tests were conducted for the standard and fatigue specimens at five phases during 15 months with different intervals between each testing sequence. After completing each testing phase, the test specimens were exposed under environmental effects till the next phase. Air infiltration tests have been conducted in accordance with TS EN 1253 standard where the air infiltration limit value is set as 1, 5 "m" ^" 3 " "/" "m" ^" 2 " "h". Static water penetration tests have been conducted in accordance with TS EN 12155 standard and impermeability of the specimens were observed during the tests where quantitative data were not possible to obtain due to the testing procedure. Wind resistance tests have been conducted in accordance with TS EN 12179 standard, the 15 mm deflection limit value given by the standard was taken into consideration. Seismic resistance tests have been conducted in accordance with AAMA 501. 4 and AAMA 501. 7 standards where a horizontal movement/displacement was applied on the lower beams placed on the specimens in the amount stated in the standard. Potential damages were conducted following these tests. Dynamic water penetration tests have been conducted in accordance with AAMA 501. 1 standard. A ROTAX aircraft type engine was used as a wind generator simultaneously with high pressure water application on the specimen. The water penetration of the inner surface of the specimen was inspected during the tests. The fatigue procedure application has been performed in accordance with ETAG 17 standard. Suction was applied in accordance with the standard. At the end of the test, the specimen was scrutinied whether there is any deficiency or failure. Both specimens used in the experimental part of the study are identical and 5 performance tests were conducted on each one during a 450 day long test process. Generally accepted and prevalently used standard test procedures were applied on specimen P whereas two additional procedures were conducted on specimen FP to fatigue the façade system in order to obtain more realistic results regarding the long term performance of the unitized <b>curtain</b> wall <b>panels.</b> These tests were defined as dynamic impermeability test comprising water spray application with high wind pressure and ETAG 17 comprising gradual increase in air pressure and sudden application of suction loads. A multi-criteria performance evaluation was conducted with the obtained experimental data by considering the load-bearing and impermeability criteria. Multiple criteria evaluation methods, namely AHP, COPRAS and TOPSIS, were used {{within the framework of the}} performance evaluation and the results were compared. One single and several best options to present the purpose or purposes were chosen by the performance evaluation method related with the decision making. The definition of the multiple criteria decision is being carried out by determining the criteria related to the problem as well as determining the suitability of the alternatives in relation to the chosen criteria. The multiple criteria decision process can be defined generally as defining the problem, determination of the assessment criteria, preparation of the criterion layers and their standardisation, the definition of the criterion weights and the application of the decision analysis. Assessment criteria have to be determined after defining the problem during the decision analysis. The criteria which were defined with regard to the purposes of the decision problem have to be measurable by a number indicating the choices of the decision maker. A total of 10 criteria have been identified in the study. The alternative with the highest numerical value received higher points during the scoring of the alternatives in the assessment. Therefore, a high score value indicates a high numerical result meaning that the relevant alternative provides values, which are closer to the borderlines values. The condition of being close to borderline values, proves that the relevant alternative provides more critical results in comparison to other results. The “critical level” was defined within the performance evaluation process and it indicates the values (%) of the obtained performance indicators as a result of the assessment results. The performance indicator data obtained from the calculations of the AHP, COPRAS and TOPSIS methods, were utilized during the numerical assessment process. Here, the critical levels of the samples at the 0 th, 90 th, 270 th, 390 th and 450 th days were calculated. As a result of the performance evaluations, it has been determined that it is not possible to ignore the climatic effects on the building structure in which the façade system is mounted. Acquirement of appropriate results in a unitized <b>curtain</b> wall <b>panel</b> system which has been tested with adherence to the prevalently used experimental procedure, or in other words, the results which are not exceeding the limit values given in the standards, do not mean that this wall system will not experience any damage throughout its lifetime. One important result obtained as a result of this present study is that a unitized <b>curtain</b> wall <b>panel</b> system, which has been tested without taking into consideration the unexpected conditions it may endure, may face a shorter life expectancy in case it is exposed to these untested conditions.

40|$|Nowadays modern {{high-rise}} {{buildings have}} unique facades which partly {{rely on the}} incorporation of curtain walls. A curtain-wall system encloses the building to separate {{the internal and external}} environments. It can reduce building weight and it also transfers the wind load to the floor structure of the building. Wind-load codes govern the design of safe curtain wall systems against natural wind forces, considering direct static and dynamic pressure. In this paper aero-elastic considerations are investigated as a potential failure mode of <b>curtain</b> walls. Curtain-wall <b>panels</b> are regarded as comprising a flexible material such as glass and aluminium cladding subjected to an airflow that is parallel to their surface. It is well-known that a flexible panel exposed to increasingly high flow speed will succumb to a divergence, or static buckling-type, instability at a particular critical flow speed. At a higher flow speed the panel will experience violent oscillatory flutter-type instability. Accordingly, we investigate the susceptibility of curtain-wall panels to aero-elastic effects. A state-space model, based upon computational modelling, is used to investigate the aero-elastic stability of each flexible panel in isolation. We briefly present a recently developed approach and its new extension to theoretical modelling of the fully-coupled interaction between a simply-supported flexible panel and a fluid flow. We solve the boundary-value problem to determine the long-time response and investigate the effects on stability of adding localised structural inhomogeneity. Localised structural inhomogeneity is incorporated as an additional single spring type support to the panel. The dependence of instability onset-flow speeds, and the forms of divergence and flutter instabilities, upon the added spring stiffness and its location are then investigated. Results show that the morphology of the unstable solution space significantly differs from that of the oft-studied corresponding hydro-elasticity problem because of the different density ratio between fluid and solid media. Of particular interest is that in the present aero-elastic system flutter occurs through the coalescence of two non-oscillatory unstable divergence modes. The inclusion of a localised spring support to an otherwise unsupported panel is shown to be stabilising with respect to the critical divergence-onset flow speed and the limits to this strategy are identified. This strategy is marginally destabilising with respect to the more damaging flutter instability that occurs at higher wind speeds. However, at a sufficiently high spring-stiffness a sudden change to the solution morphology occurs that yields two unstable non-oscillatory divergence modes and flutter is postponed to much higher wind speeds. We close the paper with an assessment of what these results mean in dimensional terms as applied to different cladding panels. Overall, our results suggest a means to ameliorate adverse aero-elastic effects in potentially disastrous extreme wind-force situations such as those encountered in typhoons and tropical cyclones...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} numerically the human thermal response that 24 students and 1 teacher feel in a classroom equipped with radiant cooling systems and subjected to uniform convective environments, in lightly warm conditions. The evolution of thermal comfort conditions, using the PMV index, is made by the multi-nodal human thermal comfort model. In this numerical model, that works in transient or steady-state conditions and simulates simultaneously a group of persons, the three-dimensional body is divided in 24 cylindrical and 1 spherical elements. Each element is divided in four parts (core, muscle, fat and skin), sub-divided in several layers, and protected by several clothing layers. This numerical model is divided in six parts: human body thermal system, clothing thermal system, integral equations resolution system, thermoregulatory system, heat exchange between {{the body and the}} environment and thermal comfort evaluation. Seven different radiant systems are combined to three convective environments. In the radiant systems (1) no radiant system without warmed curtain, (2) no radiant system with warmed curtain, (3) radiant floors cooling system with warmed <b>curtain,</b> (4) radiant <b>panels</b> cooling system with warmed curtain, (5) radiant ceiling cooling system with warmed curtain, (6) radiant floor and panels cooling system with warmed curtain and (7) radiant ceiling and panels cooling system with warmed curtain are analysed, while in the convective environments (1) without air velocity field and with uniform air velocity field of (2) 0. 2 m/s and (3) 0. 6 m/s are also analysed. The internal air temperature and internal surfaces temperature are 28 degrees C, the radiant cooling surfaces temperature are 19 degrees C and the warmed internal curtains surfaces temperatures, subjected to direct solar radiation, are 40 degrees C. The numerical model calculates the Mean Radiant Temperature field, the human bodies' temperatures field and the thermal comfort level, for the 25 occupants, for the 21 analysed situations. Without uniform air velocity field, when only one individual radiant cooling system is used, the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied people is lowest when the radiant floor cooling system is applied and is highest when the radiant panel cooling system is applied. When are combined the radiant ceiling or the floor cooling systems with the radiant panel cooling system the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied people decreases. When the uniform air velocity increases the thermal comfort level, that the occupants are subjected, increases. When the radiant floor cooling system or the combination of radiant floor and panel cooling systems without uniform air velocity field is applied, the Category C is verified for some occupants. However, with a convective uniform air velocity field of 0. 2 m/s the Category B is verified and with a convective uniform air velocity field of 0. 6 m/s the Category A is verify for some occupants. In the last situation the Category C is verified, in general, for all occupants. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with new modes of ephemeral, relational practice for the Australian public art audience. It uses visual art models to investigate the use of everyday activities as an aesthetic premise for temporary public art activities in Australia and results {{from a lack of}} cohesive models/frameworks for a temporary public art practice. Public art, usually publicly commissioned work for a specific site and intended for public viewing, {{is in a state of}} change: in Australia, the transition from the production of permanent, monolithic and monumental works is recent but this transformation is already well established in Europe. I have surveyed various models of public art-making in Europe and have expanded upon the possibilities of employing these models in Australia. My research has been informed by a number of contemporary theorists and artists that, since the early 1980 s, have been concerned with practices, variously termed social sculpture (Deuys), new-genre public art (Lacy),functional site (Meyer) and relational (Bourriaud), that dissolve the distinction between public art, community art, art education and such avant-garde practices as performance and conceptual art. Since the 1990 s, artists working in public have begun to depart sharply from the dominant, abstract, ego-driven, Modernist mode of production. Rather than defining private, autonomous systems of representation, they have begun to use the vernacular: sites and social structures that directly relate to the personal experiences of the public. Instead of producing discrete objects, the focus has shifted to the infiltration of, or interventions into, the flow of the daily lives within the community. These interactions promise more profound revelations of sites and the creation (or recreation) of a sense of community. Such practices, to which the ephemeral nature of experience is fundamental, bear a clear lineage from early conceptual practice of the early 1960 s that generate interactive relationships between artists and the community. This project studies the relationship between art, the artist and the community through participation in twelve events in Europe and Australia; of these, seven were chosen to exemplify the key factors that help make a project successful or, in some cases, unsuccessful. Throughout this research the objective was to identify, describe and salvage from the social space, a temporary ongoing and sustainable justification for supporting relational practice into public art-making and programming in Australia. This, in turn, will support and provide an alternative to permanent public art that is currently favoured by major public commissioners. Methodologies have included situational observations, collections of stories, living in situ, performance-based activities, video, art in situ and permanent and temporary commissioned public art works. Each has facilitated a personal understanding of public art-making. The project concludes that the connection of people and their everyday activities, although often tenuous, is directly related to what binds communities together. Furthermore, this research suggests that 'Relational Public Art', that is, projects where artists have meaningful access to community, facilitate the free flow of a more diverse and open discourse. Despite the conclusions I have drawn, the project is not aimed to present a definitive solution to public art-making. Rather, it has been driven by the need to understand how contemporary site has changed the way in which we, as community, as artists, and as art agencies, can participate wholly within public art. This research has produced a series of national and international projects; the accompanying exhibition includes components of the final project, The Making of <b>Curtains</b> and informative <b>panels</b> that illustrate a selection of the projects that best exemplify the research topic. The exegesis includes documentation of the practical and conceptual investigations together with the research underlying the historical and contemporary themes associated with site-based art practice...|$|R
5000|$|... ==Bernard Friedman, Architect== Bernard J. Friedman’s (1916 - 2012) {{architectural}} work contributed to Tucson’s mid-century modern commercial design idiom. Between 1940 and the 1970s, his small and large-scale projects distinguished downtown Tucson and the emerging suburbs with a progressive architectural identity. Through structural expressions, elegant proportions, and chic design, his commercial, educational and religious buildings mirror {{national and international}} trends, adapted to our desert climate. With bold architectural statements, he displayed the excitement of modernism without sacrificing the elegance and monumentality of his civic designs. Born to immigrant parents and raised in Chicago, Friedman graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Architecture from the University of Illinois in 1938 and moved to Tucson in 1940. During World War II he served a Construction Officer with the U.S. Navy Civil Engineer Corps in the European Theatre between 1942 and 1946. Friedman was discharged in 1946, and returned to Tucson where he married his wife, Irma. Between 1946 and 1948 he had partnered with architect William Green designing a number of residential and commercial projects including Los Patio at 3318 - 40 East 1st Street, the El Presidio Hotel at Broadway, multiple Fourth Avenue buildings, and the new Temple Emanu‐el auditorium at 225 North Country Club Road. The 650-seat auditorium {{was designed to be}} eclipsed by and integrated into the future sanctuary. In February 1948, Friedman announced the establishment of an independent architecture and allied design practice with offices at 210 North Church Street. Friedman’s commercial architecture of this period embraced the mid- century modernist movement emphasizing the progressive use of glass, new materials, structural systems, and sculptural forms. In 1949, Friedman designed the Given Brothers Shoes Co. building at 57 E. Pennington, and the Recreational and Social Center for the Jewish Community Center on Tucson Boulevard. In early 1951, Friedman designed a new school building for Congregation Anshei Israel. During the 1951 to 1953 Korean conflict, Lieutenant Commander Friedman was called back to Washington, D.C. to serve as Coordinator for the Engineering & Technical Services Division, Bureau of Yards and Docks. He returned from active duty in August 1953, and re-opened his architectural practice in a building he designed at 2233 East Broadway. In September he had been commissioned to design the new Jewish Community Center on Plummer Avenue, north of Broadway, replacing the existing building at 134 S. Tucson Boulevard. That same year he designed the Rillito Park steel and concrete grandstand, and a subdivision model house called The Arizona Contemporary built by J. R. Schibley at 7210 North Oracle Road. In 1954 Friedman designed two iconic modernist storefronts that expressed the post WWII era American commercial architecture; Daniel’s Jewelers at 21 E. Congress, built by M. M. Sundt Construction, and Hirsh’s Shoes at 2934 East Broadway Boulevard. A 1955 commercial building at 2901 Broadway for Mr. and Mrs. Max Saltzman represents a clear departure from the narrow storefronts synonymous with dense commercial districts and development patterns of the pre‐war era, the Saltzman building was designed to engage the attention of commuters in fast moving automobiles. This is building as billboard with expansive glass <b>curtain</b> walls, integrated <b>panel</b> monument signage and interior illumination to showcase the merchandise after dark. In October 1956, Friedman & Jobusch Architects & Engineers was created with Friedman’s university classmate, Fred H. Jobusch. Jobusch had moved to Tucson in 1944. He served as a president of the Southern Arizona Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, Southern Arizona Chapter of the Arizona Society of Professional Engineers, and President of The Sertoma Club of Tucson. From 1953 through 1959 he served {{as a member of the}} State Board of Technical Registration for Architects and Engineers. Between 1956 and the early 1960s, the firm designed multiple commercial buildings in Tucson. Along the Sunshine Mile, they designed the Broadway Building at 2221 E. Broadway, Nehring Insurance Agency at 2605-2609 E. Broadway, Arnie Rents at 1501 E. Broadway and the Arizona Bank Building at 2102 E. Broadway. Elsewhere, the firm designed Kal Rubin City, Amphi Plaza Shopping Center, Copa Bowl, Jewish Community Center additions, Gordon’s El Rancho store at 3396 East Speedway, the Cactus Bowl, the Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity House, the Alpha Epsilon Phi Sorority House, Campbell Plaza Shopping Center, the El Dorado Motel in Nogales and Tucson City Hall. During this period they also completed work on a shopping center in Key West Florida. Friedman and Jobusch designed the first Levy’s Department Store at the new El Con Mall in the 1960s. This project was a joint venture between Friedman and Jobusch Architects and Albert C. Martin and Associates of Los Angeles. Besides a large canon of commercial work, the firm also developed a specialty in educational buildings, designing the University of Arizona College of Medicine, the Agricultural Sciences Building, the Physics-Math-Meteorology Building, the Pharmacy‐Microbiology Building, and the Chemistry Building. Other educational work included Pima Community College, Sahuaro High School, Canyon del Oro High School, Donaldson Elementary School, Katherine Van Buskirk Elementary School, and Clara Fish Roberts Elementary School. Friedman's projects covered a broad range of commercial, civic and municipal buildings including the Tucson Community Center; Tucson Music Hall; Astrophysics, Environmental, Electronic, Instrumentation, Computer and Optical Laboratory facilities for Kitt Peak National Observatory, the Chris-Town Mall in Phoenix, and the Plaza International Hotel and Aztec Inn. In addition to the Temple Emanu-El, he also designed other religious buildings, including Congregation Anshei Israel, St. Albans Episcopal Church, St. Mark's Methodist Church, and Streams in the Desert Lutheran Church. Friedman was interested in the role of landscape and included integrated landscape design in his later projects. The sculptural 1971 Valley National Bank Branch on the northwest corner of Country Club Road and Broadway Boulevard is perhaps Friedman’s most recognized and iconic building. Featured in national magazines and television, this building is a true regional landmark and a beloved example of modern design. During his career Friedman served as president of the Southern Arizona Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, a member on the AIA Planning and Zoning Committee, a member of the Architectural Advisory Committee of Pima County, Arizona, the Architectural Advisor for the Tucson Jewish Community Center, a member of the Board of Directors of the Tucson Botanical Society, the Tucson Chamber of Commerce, the Tucson Festival Society, and a member of the City of Tucson Building Code Review Committee. Bernard J. Friedman died on June 21, 2012, at the age of 96.|$|R
