The patient presented with a Grade 5 / 6 right apical systolic murmur, but was clinically normal. The co-existence of such profound cardiac abnormalities serves as a unique case study of canine congenital heart disease. This case illustrates that some severe heart diseases, such as rPDA, may not {{be associated with a}} murmur and that the patient can often <b>compensate</b> <b>well</b> in the face of multiple, severe cardiac abnormalities.

It employs as a background estimate, events normally rejected {{according to a}} cosmic-ray background rejection criterion based on image shape, but with reconstructed directions overlapping the source of interest. This so-called template background model is demonstrated using example data taken with the stereoscopic HEGRA System of Cerenkov Telescopes.

However, in {{high-resolution}} ISAR imaging, RD algorithm will be invalid {{because of the presence}} of the MTRC and time-varying Doppler. The Keystone algorithm can correct the linear MTRC, but it is invalid for the high-order MTRC and phase errors. After the correction of linear MTRC, the ISAR image with large rotation angle would be still blurred. Since both the range and Doppler curve are permitted in the PFA, both range-azimuth coupling and time-varying Doppler can be <b>compensated</b> <b>well</b> and yields a well-focused image. In this subsection, the standard PFA algorithm will be introduced and the maximum rotation angles of PFA will be analyzed with comparison to RDA and Keystone algorithm. The efficiency of PFA in MTRC compensation will be also illustrated.|$|R

30|$|Despite {{the less}} than {{acceptable}} frame rates (< 26 fps) of Table 3 across {{all but one}} level of resolution scaling, an important piece of insight is still gained from the data within Tables 2 and 3 when analyzed together. In Table 2, the RTL designed interface, at the highest 1920 × 1088 HD target resolution, scaling to 16 -PPUs results in a frame rate of 62 fps. The 62 fps rate, for most video applications, is {{beyond what is necessary}} (263 ~ 0 fps). However, the same level of scaling, using a software IO interface in Table 3 still produces a useable frame rate of 30 fps. What this reveals is an important tradeoff—dialing up the computational performance of the accelerator can indeed compensate for limited IO throughput, and <b>compensate</b> <b>well</b> enough to achieve acceptable system performance.|$|R

40|$|Under highly dynamic conditions, the star-spots on {{the image}} sensor of a star tracker move across many pixels during the {{exposure}} time, which will reduce star detection sensitivity and increase star location errors. However, this kind of effect can be <b>compensated</b> <b>well</b> by setting an appropriate exposure time. This paper focuses on how exposure time affects the star tracker under highly dynamic conditions and how to determine the most appropriate exposure time for this case. Firstly, the effect of exposure time on star detection sensitivity is analyzed by establishing the dynamic star-spot imaging model. Then the star location error is deduced based on the error analysis of the sub-pixel centroiding algorithm. Combining these analyses, the effect of exposure time on attitude accuracy is finally determined. Some simulations are carried out to validate these effects, and {{the results show that}} there are different optimal exposure times for different angular velocities of a star tracker with a given configuration. In addition, the results of night sky experiments using a real star tracker agree with the simulation results. The summarized regularities in this paper should prove helpful in the system design and dynamic performance evaluation of the highly dynamic star trackers...|$|R
40|$|Possible {{change of}} the phase {{advances}} by means of IR 4 under the present new boundary conditions imposed by the beam screens have been examined. If the vacuum chamber aperture corresponds to a primary collimator setting to 7 sigma, the maximum change in phase advance is +- 0. 06 x 2 pi in the horizontal plane and +- 0. 16 x 2 pi in the vertical plane simultaneously. For a setting to 6. 5 sigma, these changes become +- 0. 12 x 2 pi and +- 0. 20 x 2 pi, respectively. The maximum difference of b 2 s, in any magnet, between the two rings which can be compensated is 1 unit. This assumes that the non-linear chromaticity in physics is <b>compensated</b> <b>well</b> enough with the sextupole families and that the tuning quadrupoles are reserved for operation adjustments. If a larger value of b 2 s is expected, either special quadrupoles with an inter-axis distance of 420 mm have to be added in IR 4 to extend its tunability, or the operational tune-shifts have to be limited because {{of the use of}} the tuning quadrupoles to compensate for the difference in b 2 s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simulation model for analyzing {{the probability of}} power supply failure in hybrid photovoltaic-wind power generation systems incorporating a storage battery bank, and also analyzes {{the reliability of the}} systems. An analysis of the complementary characteristics of solar irradiance and wind power for Hong Kong is presented. The analysis of local weather data patterns shows that solar power and wind power can <b>compensate</b> <b>well</b> for one another, and can provide a good utilization factor for renewable energy applications. For the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) analysis, the calculation objective functions and restraints are set up for the design of hybrid systems and to assess their reliability. To demonstrate the use of the model and LPSP functions, a case study of hybrid solar-wind power supply for a telecommunication system is presented. For a hybrid system on the islands surrounding Hong Kong, a battery bank with an energy storage capacity of 3 days is suitable for ensuring the desired LPSP of 1 %, and a LPSP of 0 % can be achieved with a battery bank of 5 days storage capacity.

The development and characterization of new wheat—D. breviaristatum introgression lines is important to determine the novel gene(s) on specific chromosome(s). We first used multi-color {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) to identify the individual D. breviaristatum Vb chromosomes in a common wheat—D. breviaristatum partial amphiploid, TDH- 2. The FISH patterns of D. breviaristatum chromosomes were different from those of D. villosum chromosomes. Lines D 2146 and D 2150 were selected from a cross between wheat line MY 11 and wheat—D. breviaristatum partial amphiploid TDH- 2, and they were characterized by FISH and PCR-based molecular markers. We found that D 2150 was a monosomic addition line for chromosome 5 Vb of D. breviaristatum, while D 2146 had the 5 VbL chromosome arm translocated with wheat chromosome 5 AS. Molecular marker analysis confirmed that the introduced D. breviaristatum chromosome 5 VbL translocation possessed a duplicated region homoeologous to 5 AS, revealing that the 5 AS. 5 VbL translocation may not functionally <b>compensate</b> <b>well.</b> The dwarfing and the pre-harvest re-growth habits observed in the wheat—D. breviaristatum chromosome 5 Vb derivatives may be useful for future development of perennial growth wheat lines...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of {{correlation}} {{when both}} variables are potentially right censored is confounded by identifiability issues and typically requires {{assumptions about the}} nature of the association. Semiparametric approaches have included the use of copulas, frailties or mixed models. Given that correlation is most meaningful within the context of linear association we consider iterative processes via alternating or 'criss-cross' censored linear regressions to estimate the bivariate correlation, under the assumption that each variable regresses linearly on the other. Two approaches are considered. In the first, value fragments corresponding to re-distributed censored responses from one regression are imputed as weighted explanatory variables in the alternative and the process iterated. Correlation is estimated via the two sets of slope parameters. The second replaces the weighted values by data augmentation. The efficacies of the approaches are compared and illustrated via simulations. Our initial results suggest that both methods <b>compensate</b> <b>well</b> for the censoring even with a significant proportion of cases having both variables censored, with the data augmentation approach slightly less biased. Additional (uncensored) covariates can be readily incorporated. We demonstrate the method via analysis of correlated immunological and virological measures on HIV- 1 positive patients from the WAH IV Cohort, which may be incomplete for a variety of reasons...|$|R
