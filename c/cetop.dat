50|$|<b>CETOP</b> (Central European Blue Chip Index) is a {{stock market}} index which {{reflects}} {{the performance of the}} companies with the biggest market value and turnover in the Central European region. The aim of the <b>CETOP</b> index is to serve as a benchmark for the portfolio managers who invest in the region. Blue chip equities of the Central European region are included in the index basket {{selected on the basis of}} global ranking, taking into account that a maximum of 7 securities from one stock exchange may be simultaneously included in the index.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{data set}} from five {{regional}} stock exchanges (Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Hungary and Germany), {{this paper presents}} a frequency domain analysis of a causal relationship between the returns on the CROBEX, SBITOP, <b>CETOP</b> and DAX indices, and the return on the major Serbian stock exchange index, BELEX 15. We find evidence of a somewhat dominant effect of the CROBEX and <b>CETOP</b> stock indices on the BELEX 15 stock index {{across a range of}} frequencies. The results also indicate that the BELEX 15 index and the SBITOP index interact in a bi-directional causal fashion. Finally, the DAX index movements consistently drive the BELEX 15 index returns for cycle lengths between 3 and 11 days without any feedback effect...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDigital {{hydraulic}} valve {{system is a}} new kind of hydraulic control valve assembly, which has potential to save energy and improve performance of valve controlled actuators. The typical digital valve system has 4 - 6 parallel connected on/off valves per control edge totaling 16 - 24 valves in the four-way valve configuration. The flow capacities of the parallel connected valves are set according to the powers of two such {{that it is possible to}} achieve 2 N different flow rates with N valves. An alternative approach is to use equally sized valves, which means that N parallel connected valves give only N+ 1 different flow rates. This approach has several benefits, but the number of valves becomes very large. This paper shows that it is possible to implement valve assembly having 128 miniaturized valves, such that it can be installed instead of traditional <b>CETOP</b> 3 servo or proportional valve. Careful electromagnetic optimization and mechatronic design are used together with novel manufacturing methods and new type of power electronics. The prototype is build and experimentally studied and results show that the performance of this kind of digital valve system is superior to traditional four-way control valves in terms of response time and fault tolerance...|$|E
