40|$|Summary. This study {{presents}} an ecological {{analysis of the}} relationship between infant mortality and economic status by race in metropolitan Ohio, using census data on mother's residence and economic status determined by the percentage of low income families living in each area. Our analysis updates previous studies as white-non-white comparisons for total infant mortality are examined for the US censuses of 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000; and more detailed period- and broad <b>cause-specific</b> <b>rates</b> are presented for 2000. A pronounced inverse association is consistently found between income status and infant mortality for whites, while for non-whites this pattern first emerges in 1979 - 81, disappears during the 1980 s and then returns more strongly during the 1990 s. Similarly, the 2000 data reveal a consistent inverse pattern between income status and infant mortality for white and non-white neonatal and post-neonatal death rates, as well as exogenous <b>cause-specific</b> death <b>rates.</b> We conclude that low income whites and non-whites at all income levels have infant mortality rates substantially higher than the overall rate for the population.

40|$|Objectives To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between <b>cause-specific</b> perinatal death <b>rates,</b> material deprivation and birthweight among births in 3 consecutive years in the West Midlands Health Region. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Setting West Midlands Health Region (WMHR). Study population All births (live and stillbirths) to mothers with addresses in the WMHR in 1991, 1992 and 1993. Main outcome measures <b>Cause-specific</b> perinatal death <b>rates</b> - crude and stratified by birthweight. Methods Perinatal deaths in the WMHR in 1991 - 93, collected {{as part of the}} national Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirths and Deaths in Infancy, were classified into causes of death by the extended Wigglesworth classification. Crude <b>rates</b> for <b>cause-specific</b> perinatal deaths and rates stratified by birthweight < 2500 g and {{greater than or equal to}} 2500 g were calculated for each enumeration district (ED) quintile derived by ranking enumeration districts for the whole of the region by Townsend Deprivation Index. <b>Cause-specific</b> <b>rates</b> of death were investigated for a linear trend across ED quintiles. The relative risk of death (most vs least deprived) from specific causes was calculated. Using rates for the least deprived quintile as the reference, deaths from each cause 'attributable' to social inequality were calculated. Results Positive linear trends in perinatal deaths were noted with increasing deprivation for each specific cause of death except those classified as 'other causes' (Wigglesworth Class E). Relative risk (most vs least deprived) of perinatal death with a congenital anomaly was 1. 98 (confidence interval, CI: 1. 36, 2. 89). For deaths related to antepartum events, intrapartum events and immaturity the risks were 1. 81 (CI: 1. 39, 2. 38), 1. 48 (CI: 1. 10, 1. 98) and 1. 92 (CI 1. 45, 2. 56), respectively. Forty-three (35. 7 %) perinatal deaths per year were due to congenital anomalies, 63 (29. 7 %) antepartum events, 36 (21. 9 %) intrapartum events and 61 (32. 7 %) immaturity and these were statistically 'attributable' to social inequality. <b>Cause-specific</b> perinatal death <b>rates</b> for babies < 2500 g showed no correlation with deprivation; however, for babies greater than or equal to 2500 g the association with deprivation persisted. Conclusions All <b>cause-specific</b> <b>rates</b> except those due to 'other causes' showed a positive linear trend with increasing deprivation. These trends were found for infants born greater than or equal to 2500 g but were not seen for low birthweight infants (< 2500 g). Almost 30 % of deaths were statistically 'attributable' to social inequality. The results of this study suggest that material deprivation plays an important role in the causal pathway leading to perinatal death and needs to be addressed in preventive programmes aimed at the reduction of perinatal deaths...|$|R
40|$|Summary. In {{competing}} risks data, missing failure types (causes) {{is a very}} common phenomenon. In a general missing pattern, if a failure type is not observed, one observes a set of possible types containing the true type along with the failure time. Dewanji and Sengupta (2003) considered nonparametric estimation of the <b>cause-specific</b> hazard <b>rates</b> and suggested a Nelson-Aalen type estimator under such general missing pattern. In this work, {{we deal with the}} regression problem, in which the <b>cause-specific</b> hazard <b>rates</b> may depend on some covariates, and consider estimation of the regression coefficients and the cause-specific baseline hazards under the general missing pattern using some semi-parametric models. We consider two different proportional hazards type semi-parametric models for our analysis. We also consider an example from an animal experiment to illustrate our methodology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Many {{researchers}} are {{interested to know}} if there are any improvements in recent treatment results for metastatic breast cancer in the community, especially for 10 - or 15 -year survival. Methods Between 1981 and 1985, 782 and 580 female patients with metastatic breast cancer were extracted respectively from the Connecticut and San Francisco-Oakland registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The lognormal statistical method to estimate survival was retrospectively validated since the 15 -year <b>cause-specific</b> survival <b>rates</b> could be calculated using the standard life-table actuarial method. Estimated rates were compared to the actuarial data available in 2000. Between 1991 and 1995, further 752 and 632 female patients with metastatic breast cancer were extracted respectively from the Connecticut and San Francisco-Oakland registries. The data were analyzed to estimate the 15 -year <b>cause-specific</b> survival <b>rates</b> before the year 2005. Results The 5 -year period (1981 – 1985) was chosen, and patients were followed as a cohort for an additional 3 years. The estimated 15 -year <b>cause-specific</b> survival <b>rates</b> were 7. 1 % (95 % confidence interval, CI, 1. 8 – 12. 4) and 9. 1 % (95 % CI, 3. 8 – 14. 4) by the lognormal model for the two registries of Connecticut and San Francisco-Oakland respectively. Since the SEER database provides follow-up information {{to the end of the}} year 2000, actuarial calculation can be performed to confirm (validate) the estimation. The Kaplan-Meier calculation for the 15 -year <b>cause-specific</b> survival <b>rates</b> were 8. 3 % (95 % CI, 5. 8 – 10. 8) and 7. 0 % (95 % CI, 4. 3 – 9. 7) respectively. Using the 1991 – 1995 5 -year period cohort and followed for an additional 3 years, the 15 -year <b>cause-specific</b> survival <b>rates</b> were estimated to be 9. 1 % (95 % CI, 3. 8 – 14. 4) and 14. 7 % (95 % CI, 9. 8 – 19. 6) for the two registries of Connecticut and San Francisco-Oakland respectively. Conclusions For the period 1981 – 1985, the 15 -year cause-specific survival for the Connecticut and the San Francisco-Oakland registries were comparable. For the period 1991 – 1995, there was not much change in survival for the Connecticut registry patients, but there was an improvement in survival for the San Francisco-Oakland registry patients. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cox {{model has}} been the {{commonly}} used method in past analyses of association between obesity and the risk estimates of cancer in situations where the subjects have also died (or could die) of noncancer events (competing events). The Cox model {{does not address the}} presence of competing events convincingly. The competing risk approach accommodates the fact that individuals who died of other causes (competing events) will never die of cancer and thus provides more realistic estimates. This study uses the competing risk approach to study the association of obesity and cancer mortality and compare the analysis results with those based on the traditional Cox model. It was seen that while the <b>cause-specific</b> hazard <b>rate</b> of cancer is significantly higher for obese population compared to normal weight population, the difference is not significant using competing risk approach. We demonstrated that higher <b>cause-specific</b> hazard <b>rate</b> does not necessarily imply higher incidence rate and in situations involving competing events we recommend using competing risk approach in addition to the Cox regression model...|$|R

40|$|Background: Data {{needed to}} {{estimate}} {{causes of death}} and the pattern of these deaths are scarce in sub-Saharan Africa. Such data are very important for targeting, monitoring, and evaluating health interventions. Objective: To estimate the mortality rate and determine causes of death among adults (aged 15 years and older) in a rural district of southern Ghana, using the InterVA- 4 model. Design: Data used were generated from verbal autopsies conducted for registered adult members of the Dodowa Health and Demographic Surveillance System who died between 2006 and 2010. The InterVA- 4 model was used to assign the cause of death. Results: Overall, the mortality rate for the period under review was 7. 5 / 1, 000 person-years (py) for the general population and 10. 4 / 1, 000 py for those aged 15 and older. The {{leading cause of death}} was communicable diseases (CDs), with a malaria-specific mortality rate of 1. 06 / 1, 000 py. Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) -specific mortality rate was the next highest (1. 01 / 1, 000 py). HIV/AIDS attributed deaths were lower among males than females. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contributed to 28. 3 % of the deaths with <b>cause-specific</b> mortality <b>rate</b> of 2. 93 / 1, 000 py. Stroke topped the list with <b>cause-specific</b> mortality <b>rate</b> of 0. 69 / 1, 000 py. As expected, young males (15 – 49 years) contributed to more road traffic accident (RTA) deaths; they had a lower RTA <b>cause-specific</b> mortality <b>rate</b> than older males (50 – 64 years). Conclusions: Data indicate that CDs (e. g. malaria and TB) remain the major cause of death with NCDs (e. g. stroke) following closely behind.

The goal o f the research is to compare national death trends with jail death trends in order to determine (1) if the problem is as grave as the available literature suggests, and (2) if any major changes have occurred as a result of federal court activism. Indeed, we found that when an adjusted general population death rate is employed certain <b>cause-specific</b> <b>rates</b> are actually lower in jail. This generalization, while true for natural causes and homicides, was not the case for suicides. Depending upon which general population rates are compared with which jail rates, inmates committed suicide at a rate that was between five and fifteen times higher than the rate for free-world citizens. Between censuses, the general trend in jail death rates was generally downward, although once again suicide rates tended to exhibit less of a decrease than the rates for homicides and death by natural causes.

Patients and Methods The data for patients with endometrioid-type endometrial cancer (n = 208) who had been treated at the gynecology oncology ward of Vali-e-Asr Hospital of Tehran, Iran, between 1999 and 2009 were analyzed. Results The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 54 years (range, 28 - 74). <b>Cause-specific</b> survival <b>rates</b> of the entire group were 92 %, 87 % and 82 %, at two, three and five years, respectively. The five-year <b>cause-specific</b> survival <b>rates</b> for grades one, two and three were 98 %, 88 % and 68 %, respectively.

Analysis was by intention-to-treat, based on cluster of residence, with women eligible for inclusion once they had consistently received the supplement or placebo capsules for 6 months. The analysis was based on 581 [*] 870 woman-years and 2624 deaths. <b>Cause-specific</b> mortality <b>rates</b> were found to be similar in the two study arms.

We clarify {{the distinction between}} modeling the <b>cause-specific</b> hazard <b>rate</b> and modeling the cumulative incidence probability or function, and we review regression techniques for both types of quantities. We apply them to 2 examples: 1 comparing engraftment and 1 examining relapse. These examples illustrate that different conclusions may result {{depending on the type}} of regression model used for comparing treatments. Finally, we show how these discrepancies occur because 2 different characteristics of the time-to-event distribution are being modeled...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Childhood mortality, {{particularly}} in the first 5 years of life, is a major global concern and the target of Millennium Development Goal 4. Although the majority of childhood deaths occur in Africa and Asia, these are also the regions where such deaths are least likely to be registered. The INDEPTH Network works to alleviate this problem by collating detailed individual data from defined Health and Demographic Surveillance sites. By registering deaths and carrying out verbal autopsies to determine cause of death across many such sites, using standardised methods, the Network seeks to generate population-based mortality statistics that are not otherwise available. OBJECTIVE: To present a description of <b>cause-specific</b> mortality <b>rates</b> and fractions over the first 15 years of life as documented by INDEPTH Network sites in sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia. DESIGN: All childhood deaths at INDEPTH sites are routinely registered and followed up with verbal autopsy (VA) interviews. For this study, VA archives were transformed into the WHO 2012 VA standard format and processed using the InterVA- 4 model to assign cause of death. Routine surveillance data also provided person-time denominators for mortality <b>rates.</b> <b>Cause-specific</b> mortality <b>rates</b> and <b>cause-specific</b> mortality fractions are presented according to WHO 2012 VA cause groups for neonatal, infant, 1 - 4 year and 5 - 14 year age groups. RESULTS: A total of 28, 751 childhood deaths were documented during 4, 387, 824 person-years over 18 sites. Infant mortality ranged from 11 to 78 per 1, 000 live births, with under- 5 mortality from 15 to 152 per 1, 000 live births. Sites in Vietnam and Kenya accounted for the lowest and highest mortality rates reported. CONCLUSIONS: Many children continue to die from relatively preventable causes, {{particularly in}} areas with high rates of malaria and HIV/AIDS. Neonatal mortality persists at relatively high, and perhaps sometimes under-documented, rates. External causes of death are a significant childhood problem in some settings. P.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of GeographyBimal K. PaulThis {{research}} set out {{to better}} understand the impact of socioeconomic characteristics, environmental risk, and the built environment on health in Mobile County, Alabama. A multilevel statistical analysis was used to identify those characteristics that had the greatest impact on health. The variables determined to be the most significant in defining health in Mobile County were used {{in the development of a}} health inequity index (HIQ). The index was used to identify the zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) in Mobile County that were likely to exhibit greater health inequality, and as a result, a higher potential for health inequity. In this study, a mailed survey on the built environment and health was conducted to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of individual residences, perceptions of individuals in regards to neighborhood health, citizen activism, and the environmental justice movement. Because there was a low response rate for the mailed surveys, fieldwork with face-to-face interviews was conducted in July, 2009. In conjunction with the survey data, mortality data obtained from the Alabama Department of Public Health was incorporated into the multilevel analysis. Using crude death <b>rate,</b> <b>cause-specific</b> death <b>rate</b> for cancer, and <b>cause-specific</b> death <b>rate</b> for heart disease as dependent variables and factors associated with socioeconomic status, environmental risk, and the built environment as independent variables, multiple linear regression was performed. The results of the multiple linear regression identified factors of socioeconomic status, environmental risk, and the built environment that had the greatest impact on health in Mobile County. Geographically weighted regression was performed to test local model strength by ZCTA in Mobile County. It was determined that the health inequity index developed as a result of the multilevel analysis was a reasonable measure of population health. Calculations of HIQ for each ZCTA in Mobile County helped to identify those ZCTAs most in need of intervention. The ZCTAs with high HIQ values were also those where the built environment was extremely poor, indicating that health is impacted by the places where people live...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Area and {{time-specific}} {{estimates of}} disease <b>rates,</b> <b>cause-specific</b> mortality <b>rates</b> {{and other key}} health indicators are of great interest for health care and policy purposes. Such estimates provide the information needed to identify areas with increased risk, effectively allocate resources, and target interventions. A wide variety of data, such as vital statistics, complex surveys, demographic surveillance sites, and disease registries, are used for these purposes. Unfortunately, the sample size of data available at a granular space-time scale is often too small to provide reliable estimates and uncertainty intervals. Using data from multiple sources and spatial and temporal smoothing is beneficial to alleviate problems of data scarcity. The purpose of the work described herein is to use Bayesian space-time models, to combine data from multiple sources to provide reliable area-based estimates. This work is motivated by estimating rates of health indicators (e. g. diabetes, smoking) by health reporting areas in King County from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, child mortality by regions in Tanzania from Demographic and Health Surveys and demographic surveillance sites, and cancer-specific incidence and mortality rates in Europe from government data and local registries...|$|R
