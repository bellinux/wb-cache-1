40|$|AbstractIn {{the course}} of {{completion}} of an ultra-deep well newly drilled in the Yuanba Gasfield, Sichuan Basin, long-section and large-scale deformation occurred in the heavy <b>casing</b> <b>section</b> and nickel base alloy <b>casing</b> <b>section</b> of the sealing Triassic limestone interval, so a new hole had to be sidetracked, which impels us to rediscover the applicability of conventional drilling and completion technology in ultra-deep wells. In this paper, based on the borehole condition and field operation data of this well, the borehole pressure field variation initiated by lost circulation in the low-pressure formation was analyzed {{from the perspective of}} dynamics, then, the variation pattern of differential pressure inside and outside the well bore at different time intervals was depicted, and the primary cause of such complication was theoretically revealed, i. e., the pressure wave generated by instant lost circulation in low-pressure formation would result in redistribution of pressure inside the downhole confined space, and then the crush of casing in the vicinity of local low-pressure areas. Pertinent proposals for avoiding these kinds of engineering complexities were put forward: ① when downhole sealing casing operation is conducted in open hole completion, liner completion or perforated hole, the potential damage of lost circulation to casing should be considered; ② the downhole sealing point and sealing mode should be selected cautiously: the sealing point had better be selected in the section with good cementing quality or as close to the casing shoe as possible, and the sealing mode can be either cement plug or mechanical bridge plug. This paper finally points out that good cementing quality {{plays an important role in}} preventing this type of casing deformation...|$|E

In the paper, casing axial force and wellhead movement are calculated and compared in regard to moments that free <b>sections</b> of surface <b>casing</b> appear. The parameters considered include preliminary <b>casing</b> tension, free <b>section</b> length and change in wellbore temperature. The moment that surface <b>casing</b> free <b>section</b> comes into being has great influence on wellhead movement, so it is discussed in detail. According to comprehensive investigation on deep well and ultra-deep well accidents, wellhead growth {{is based on the}} fact that before production the cement sheath of surface casing has already failed, and during production wellhead grows up due to wellbore temperature increases. The most possible reason of surface casing cement sheath failure is bad cement job quality. Bad cement sheath cannot support casing axial loads and separates from <b>casing.</b> The free <b>section</b> of surface <b>casing</b> will experience large axial force cycle which is harmful to wellbore integrity.

40|$|Shell has {{developed}} a novel mono-diameter well concept {{for oil and gas}} wells as opposed to the traditional telescopic well design. A Mono- diameter well contains multiple <b>casing</b> <b>sections</b> with the same internal diameter. This is achieved by expansion of the <b>casing</b> <b>sections</b> concerned using an expansion cone. Since the well is drilled in stages and casings are inserted to support the open hole, an overlap section between two consecutive (expandable) casings exists which has to be expanded. When the cone enters the overlap section, the expansion force increases dramatically due to the expansion of two casings, cured cement and formation layers. When the cone finalizes the expansion of the overlap section it pops out, the expansion force vanishes and the cone accelerates upwards and it generates an empty volume to be filled by the well fluid (mud). As a result of this, fluid starts to flow through the drill pipe, around the cone and the fluid volume below the cone starts to decompress. This induces a surge pressure wave traveling upwards and a swab pressure wave in the expanded casing traveling downwards. If the pressure difference between outside and inside of the expanded casing exceeds the collapse rating of the casing, the casing will collapse which leads to the loss of the concerned well section. Repair of such a failure costs time and money, therefore this swab pressure must be well predicted to enable the installation process to be designed such that this collapse can be avoided. A model of fully coupled fluid-structure interaction between cone and the well fluid is built for calculating the swab pressure propagating downward and surge pressure propagating upward resulted from transient process occurring after cone pops out. This model has shown an effective tool for predicting the swabbing pressure in field deployments performed lately in Gulf of Mexico and according to its output the suitable cone is selected {{in order to avoid the}} casing collapse.

40|$|At low {{frequencies}} tube or Stoneley waves represent a dominant arrival propagating along boreholes. They can be {{excited by the}} source in a well or by external source due to conversion from other wave types. Tube wave experiences reflection at the bed boundaries, borehole diameter changes and frac-tures or permeable zones. It was proven in previous studies that 1 D effective wavenumber approach provides simple and accurate low-frequency description of tube-wave propagation in open boreholes surrounded by radially homogeneous formation. Tube waves become even more dominant in cased boreholes, but casing further modifies wave propagation and reflection/transmission phenomena. In this study we apply 1 D effective wavenumber approach to radially inhomogeneous media and demon-strate that it still provides excellent description of low-frequency tube-wave propagation. In particu-lar, we focus on three models representative of cased boreholes: reflection from geological interfaces behind casing, reflection from corroded <b>casing</b> <b>section</b> and reflection from idealized disk-shaped per-foration in cased hole.

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringDuring {{plug and}} {{abandonment}} (P&A) operations of petroleum wells {{there is often}} a need to remove casing in order to set competent barrier sealing in all directions. If the casing cannot be cut and pulled, a section milling operation has traditionally been the solution. The P&A is an expensive operation that offers no value creation, and the economic situation of the industry along with stricter regulations is causing an active search to strongly reduce rig-time and costs. To address the situation, this thesis is compiled with an investigation into the P&A industry with a particular focus on the section milling operation and its requirements. The challenges of section milling have been discussed in depth with relations to performance enhancement, and statistics has been presented and compared with novel methods with the aim to define improvement potential. Investigated alternatives include perforate, wash and cement (PWC), upward section milling, melting, chemical degradation and the crushing of tubular. The results show that the main disadvantage of the section milling is the swarf generation and handling of it with addition to HSE issues, violent vibrations and plug verification. The improvement of the cutters and the milling fluid has been presented as the most important factors for performance enhancement. The investigation into novel methods show that several technologies have the potential to substitute section milling and to significantly reduce duration and cost, with the largest documented potential being PWC’s ability to cut the expected 24 -day multiple <b>casing</b> <b>section</b> mill operation by 83 %. However, further development is needed in order to refine the technology before it can replace section milling completely...|$|E
40|$|In the {{construction}} process {{of oil and}} gas wells, primary cementing constitutes a critical procedure of placing a cement sheath in the annulus between casing and formation, or between the casing strings. The main purpose is to provide mechanical stability to the wellbore and to ensure zonal isolation through the entire well service lifetime. Failures to achieve a proper primary cementing, and to ensure long-term sealing capabilities of the cement sheath, may severely limit the ability of a well to reach its full producing potential. Well cementing technology is a mature area, however, many operators, specifically in the North Sea, have been concerned about the ability of the cement sheath to maintain sealing integrity, given the increasing number of reported failures in mature wells. In offshore fields, these well integrity problems signify a serious concern since they imply costly repairs, limitations with respect to shortand long-term use of production and injection wells, safety and environmental issues. Therefore, recent efforts have been undertaken to achieve enhancements in the technology and standardization of logging procedures to evaluate the status of the cased-hole cement sheath barrier. Nevertheless, the verification of the cement sheath functionality still represents a technical challenge, given the uncertainty and high complexity associated with performing the task downhole. Further, it is well-know that, even in the presence of an initially good cement job, repeated temperature variations, i. e. thermal cycling, can have a detrimental impact on the integrity of the cement sheath over time. Temperature variations will cause the casing, cement and formation, to expand or contract accordingly with their distinct thermal and mechanical properties, which induce stresses that may lead to cement sheath damage. Experimental tests can be tailored for the assessment of long-term cement sheath integrity under realistic wellbore curing and operating conditions, and may establish a step forward in designing more robust and safer wells. For this reason, the main objective of this research work has been the development and application of a laboratory set-up, conceived to investigate the potential cement sheath failure mechanisms cause by time-varying thermal loads in the wellbore. A novel laboratory set-up has been designed and constructed at the Institute of Petroleum Technology Laboratory, NNTU. The focus has been to develop a testing apparatus and protocol that enables visualization of how leak paths form and propagate throughout the well annular sealant, when exposed to cyclic thermal loads and confining pressure. The set-up allowed, for the first time, studies to be performed on downscale wellbore samples constituted of casing pipe, cement and formation. The samples are intended to represent a conventional subsea well production <b>casing</b> <b>section</b> (12 1 / 4 -in borehole and a 9 5 / 8 -in casing) scaled-down by a factor of 4. Only test cases with neat class Portland G cement were assessed. However, the laboratory set-up enables the use of different types of sealants. In addition, it is presented the first use of X-ray computed tomography for the monitoring of cement sheath debonding and cracking failures over time, which provides 3 D information for identification of how, where and when the damage occurred. The experimental approach was successfully implemented, and comparative studies conducted on samples with different stand-off, surrounding formation and casing surface finish gave a new insight into the development of cement sheath failures. Numerical studies, based on the finite element method, were conducted to complement the analysis of the annular cement sheath failure mechanisms observed in the test samples throughout the various thermal cycling experiments. Furthermore, it was recognized that {{there was a lack of}} relevant knowledge on the overall impact of mechanical and thermal properties on the estimations of cement sheath stresses and mechanical failures. Consequently, as part of this research work, it was extensively studied the impact of variations in casing-cement-formation material properties, geometric parameters, casing stand-off and characteristic well-loading events, on the occurrence of cement sheath damage. The test cases were defined on the basis of a sensitivity screening of random input properties of the wellbore components, used in a conventional subsea production <b>casing</b> <b>section.</b> Based on the experimental and numerical work, an assessment of the influence of casing centralization, rock formation type and casing surface condition impact on cement sheath long-term integrity are discussed in this dissertation. The main contributions of this work are presented in four international papers contained in the Appendixes. They can be summarized as follows: • A unique experimental testing rig and procedure developed to evaluate the long-term integrity of well annular sealants towards time-varying thermal loads. The testing protocol was applied for the assessment of relevant cement sheath integrity issues. • An extensive numerical work that enabled mapping of the key variables that affect cement sheath failure mechanisms. To mitigate the risk of losing zonal isolation, guidelines for the assessment of long-term cement sheath integrity and selection of cement systems mechanical properties were given. The laboratory set-up will be used further by the sponsoring SFI DrillWell Research Centre, through SINTEF Petroleum Research as project manager, to investigate and compare the capabilities of more complex cement systems regularly used by the industry, or alternative annular sealants, to withstand time-varying loads in the wellbore...|$|E

30|$|The Venelle- 2 well is a {{directional}} {{exploratory well}} re-drilled {{from one of}} the existing dry wells with a total depth of 2200  m and reaching temperatures of approximately 350  °C, within the Lardarello Geothermal field in southern Tuscany in the close vicinity to the San Pompeo 2 well. The spudding operation began in the late August of 2017. The main aim of the project was to drill into the ‘K-horizon’ (i.e., an important seismic marker discovered from other deep drilling ventures in the area) located at depths of around 3000  m and reach supercritical geothermal resources. No production plans were made. During drilling operations, problems with partial and total circulation losses were experienced. One of the main challenges during drilling of the Venelle- 2 well was unexpectedly high pressures, encountered before reaching the target depths, which caused blow-out and eruption of tourmaline-quartz breccia and vein fragments. During cementing of a 7 ″ <b>casing</b> <b>section,</b> unexpected fire occurred around the well site and cementing was interrupted causing failure of casing equipment and slurry entry to the casing. The logging campaign performed after cementing operations proved large voids in cement sheath. The non-cemented sections at depth of 1205  m were cut off, while partially cemented sections between depths of 1205 and 1409  m were milled. Serious problems occurred during circulation stops with high density drilling fluid (1500  kg/m 3), which increased significantly wellhead pressure and caused problems while implementing standard well control procedures. The first stuck pipe incident occurred at a depth of 2695  m, which was attempted to release using firstly jarring and pulling up the drill string assembly and later by the decrease of drilling fluid density to 1350  kg/m 3. Problems with stuck pipe and circulation losses persisted and the well was eventually displaced with water in order to decrease well pressure and drilling fluid losses. Lower fluid pressures emphasized the need for reassessing well control and methods of circulation loss reduction using various squeezing and clogging techniques, which later proved to be unsuccessful. Challenges also occurred with setting up a swellable packer at greater depths in order to perform leak-off tests. Registering reliable temperature measurement was a serious issue in the Venelle- 2 venture, where multiple temperature logging tools and methods were exercised at various drilling depths. Static formation temperatures of 504  °C at a depth of 2815  m and between 507 and 517  °C at a depth of 2894  m were established from available logging tools. The Venelle- 2 well is currently temporarily abandoned with multiple cement plugs (Bretani et al. 2018).|$|E
40|$|This thesis has {{proposed}} a slender well concept for exploration drilling with 15000 psi pressure rating based on enabling technologies. The main findings relates {{to the use of}} expandable liner hangers to reduce the required radial clearance between consecutive casing sections. Finite element analysis of the liner hanger expansion is performed in Ansys Workbench, a platform for advanced engineering simulations. The background for the thesis relates to the high cost of constructing offshore wells. There is a potential for considerable cost reduction by starting the well with a substantially smaller diameter, without compromising the final pipe size across the zone of interest. The topic builds on ongoing research in SBBU – Centre for drilling and wells for improved recovery, a joint project between NTNU, Sintef, University in Stavanger and IRIS. The slender well concept renders the possibility to use modified 3 rd or 4 th generation semi-submersible rigs. These rigs have significantly lower day-rates compared to new 5 th and 6 th generation rigs. Cost reduction is also expected with respect to consumption of steel for casing, drilling fluids and cement. Additional savings in steel is obtained by basing the casing program mainly on liners. The expandable liner hanger of choice is based on the XPak liner hanger developed by TIW. Finite element analysis indicated that a pressure rating of 15000 psi is feasible with the proposed liner hanger system. To avoid reduction in burst and collapse rating, the expansion mandrel is retained in the liner hanger after expansion. The mandrel is designed such that it creates an internal flush design with the liner string. It is recommended to use metal-to-metal sealing to avoid communication around the liner top. The slender well is constructed with limited radial clearance between consecutive casing sections. The problem of high surge pressures during running in hole is overcome by introducing a surge protection system with an artificial inner annulus to displace drilling fluids. The concept of pre-installing a liner string in the surface casing is introduced to render the possibility of an additional <b>casing</b> <b>section</b> and reduction in riser ID. The concept is untested and further evaluation is recommended. For further work on the topic proper field testing is recommended to validate the reliability of the concept. An assessment of slender well production drilling is also recommended to fully exploit the potential in slender well design. More detailed analysis and testing is necessary to qualify the expandable liner hanger for 15000 psi. </p...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{downhole}} {{heat exchangers}} (DHE) in {{the exploitation of}} geothermal resources is characterized by an absence of mass withdrawal from the aquifer. Although this peculiarity reduces installation costs it also imposes limits on the heat ¯ow withdrawable (generally less than 100 kW), and, therefore, {{on the use of}} DHEs in small applications such as greenhouses, small buildings or thermal baths. For this reason DHEs are mainly used in super®cial geothermal aquifers (up to 30 mdepth), usually with liquid-phase water at temperatures greater than 60 °C.

The Westbay casing system is designed to allow the monitoring of multiple discrete levels in a single borehole. The casing comes in two different sizes, the MP38 system (38 mm, 1.5-inch) and MP55 system (55 mm, 2.25-inch). [...] One single string of water-tight Westbay <b>casing</b> <b>sections</b> is installed in the borehole. Each desired monitoring zone has valved couplings and ports to access groundwater outside the casing and instruments inside the casing. Westbay packers or backfilled seals are used to seal the borehole between monitoring zones to prevent the unnatural vertical flow of groundwater in the wellbore and maintain the in situ distribution of fluid pressures and chemistry. The Westbay system can be installed in either open rock boreholes or cased wells with multiple screens. Systems have also been installed in backfilled boreholes. Specialized equipment and probes lowered down the casing to each port are used to monitor and collect samples from Westbay systems. This system can incorporate {{a large number of}} monitoring intervals because the system is entirely modular and does not require multiple tubes extending to the ground surface. Westbay MLS systems have been installed to a maximum depth of 7,128 feet. Additional information about the system is presented by Black et al. (1986) and Einarson (2006).

40|$|Published {{scientific}} work indicates that residential large diameter drinking water wells {{are at a}} higher risk of contamination from surface water impacts than drilled wells. The possibility of a higher incidence of contamination of large diameter wells is attributed to site selection and construction problems such as leaking joints in the well casing, ineffective annular sealant placed between the well casing and the formation, a poorly fitted cover with an access lid that promotes contaminant entry and air entry without adequate air filtration, well location down gradient of septic effluent sources, and depth limitations due to improper equipment used to advance the well which results in shallow wells often situated in topographical lows. In some situations, flaws in the well design were actually deliberate measures intended to capture surface water at sites with low groundwater yield. Historically, residential drinking water well performance studies have focussed on existing wells; however, uncertainty in the actual well construction methods and materials, well age and maintenance efforts have been problematic. A field and laboratory study was completed to assess the performance of several design changes that were thought to improve the integrity of large diameter drinking water wells, and to determine whether one design is more prone to atmospheric and/or surface water contamination than the other. Four large diameter residential wells were installed at a study site in Lindsay, Ontario. Three of these wells are constructed with enhanced construction methods (two using a cement tile casing and one using a galvanized steel casing) and annular sealants, while the fourth was constructed using conventional methods for cement cased wells. The enhanced test wells utilized a sealant between the <b>casing</b> <b>sections,</b> various annular sealants between the formation and the well casing, sanitary waterline connections, and ventilation with air filtration. The well constructed using outdated methods did not have any of these advanced features. An automated water extraction system removed about 875 L/day from each well to mimic residential usage. Routine monitoring, and laboratory and field testing were used to collect pertinent data required for this performance assessment. Routine monitoring involved the visual inspection of the wells, collection of well water elevation, collection of soil temperature profile data, collection and analysis of water samples, and collection of cumulative water volumes purged from the test wells. A biofilm cleaning study and analysis of cement-bentonite grout was conducted in the laboratory while smoke and aqueous tracer tests were conducted in the field. The biofilm cleaning study entailed growing a biofilm on different large diameter well casing materials and applying cleaning methods thought to be practical for cleaning the interior walls of large diameter wells. Different mixtures of cement-bentonite grout were subjected to volume measurements, vertical load bearing capacity analysis, and hydraulic conductivity analysis to determine their suitability as a potential annular sealant. The tracer tests were developed to determine whether pathways for either airborne contaminants or surface water to enter the test wells exist. The test wells were filled with smoke and monitored for potential atmospheric pathways. A tracer solution was infiltrated around the test wells and the interior of the tests wells were monitored for potential pathways for surface water to enter. Bacteriological indicators were detected in all test wells. The smoke tracer tests demonstrated that pathways for airborne contaminants to enter the test wells exist with more pathways observed in the winter than the summer. The aqueous tracer tests highlighted several areas where surface water could enter the test wells if ponding occurred around the well casing. As expected the enhanced test wells performed much better than the conventional test well for both of these tracer tests. The results of the biofilm cleaning study indicated that galvanized steel or fibreglass casing materials were the only materials able to be cleaned effectively. The best method in this study to remove biofilm from casing materials was pressure washing. The results from the cement-bentonite grout investigation indicated that cement-bentonite grout with 5 % bentonite would make the most suitable annular sealant as its volume changed the least during curing, it was strong enough to support the load from maintenance efforts, and was the most impervious. The results {{of this study indicate that}} large diameter wells constructed with a proper annular sealant, sealant between <b>casing</b> <b>sections</b> and a sanitary waterline connection are less prone to contamination. Monitoring of the test wells should continue as they mature to determine whether this plays a significant role in their ability to prevent contamination of large diameter wells. Smoke tracer tests should be conducted again during the winter to determine if temperature was the cause of increased atmospheric pathways. A field-scale method to remove biofilm from the interior casing wall of large diameter wells should be developed and tested. A field-scale investigation of cement-bentonite grout for use as an annular sealant should be completed. Fibreglass casings can be fabricated as a continuous piece with no seams or joints and hence another well should be constructed and studied using corrugated fibreglass (NSF ANSI 61) casing...|$|R
40|$|Advances in the {{development}} of new materials continue {{to be made in the}} Geothermal Materials Project. Many successes have already been accrued and the results used commercially. In FY 1991, work was focused on reducing well drilling, fluid transport and energy conversion costs. Specific activities performed included lightweight CO{sub 2 }-resistant well cements, thermally conductive and scale resistant protective liner systems, chemical systems for lost circulation control, corrosion mitigation in process components at The Geysers, and elastomer-metal bonding systems. Efforts to transfer the technologies developed in these efforts to other energy-related sectors of the economy continued and considerable success was achieved. Laboratory testing of BNL-developed phosphate modified calcium aluminate cements confirmed their hydrolytic stability in 300 C brine and their resistance to chemical attack by CO{sub 2 }. Specimens were found to be > 20 times more resistant to carbonation than Class H cement and twice as resistant as unmodified calcium aluminate cements. Testing of thermally conductive polymer cements as potential corrosion resistant liner materials for use in heat exchanger applications was continued. Field test were conducted in flowing hypersaline brine and the results indicated scale deposition rates lower than those on a high alloy steel. Additional tests for bottoming cycle heat exchange use are planned for FY 1992. Progress was also made with chemical systems for lost circulation control. If materials placement is to be performed by pumping through an open drillpipe or through a drillable straddle packer, a bentonite-ammonium polyphosphate-borax-magnesium oxide formulation, containing fibers or particulates when large fissures are encountered, can be used. This system was ready for demonstration in FY 1991, but a suitable test site did not become available. Optimization of this and three other formulations for use with other Sandia National Laboratories developed placement technology is being continued. Work to develop high temperature hydrolytically stable chemical coupling systems needed to bond elastomers to metal reinforcement commenced. Until these become available, it will not be possible to produce many important tools needed to reduce well-drilling costs. To date very promising results have been achieved using high melting point (> 280 {sup o}) polyaromatic type adhesives. Compared to the best commercially available coupling systems which will undergo complete disbondment from stainless steel upon exposure for 1 day to brine at 200 C, copolymers made from the polyaromatic materials show no disbondment or loss of bond strength after 5 weeks. Additional work is required to improve the magnitude of the bond and to improve the thixotropic behavior of the adhesives in the liquid state.

40|$|Since {{more and}} more of the wells in the North Sea are meeting their end of lifetime, plug and {{abandonment}} is of great present interest. When a well reaches its end of production, the well can be permanently abandoned, or the slot and upper part of the well can be re-used to drill towards another target. This can be done by making a sidetrack from the original wellbore. Plug and abandonment operations may be problematic and therefore time consuming. Extra time consumption results in a lot of extra costs, and budgets are exceeded. In addition, plug and abandonment operations may cause well control situations, which is a safety and envi-ronmental risk. The main intention with this project was to highlight and find the operations during plug and abandonment of wells that have caused most downtime and well control issues. The most problematic situations needed to be found and evaluated, and a proposal for improvements should be given. The study showed that retrieval of <b>casing</b> and <b>section</b> milling was the most challenging opera-tions during plug and abandonment (P&A). Cutting and pulling of casing and completion is time consuming, and represents an uncertainty regarding well control. Section milling results in a lot of steel swarf in the well and deposits inside equipment like the BOP. When the annulus behind casings are logged, there is limited time to interpret logs if an effec-tive operation shall be maintained. The poor quality of the logs makes the interpretation job even harder, especially logging of annulus with several layers of casings in the cross section. Through present investigation a need of improved logging has been revealed, and thus avoid stuck casing by having a clear indication of what components are present in the annulus. Pre-ventive measures are to clean the well properly during the drilling operation to avoid a lot of cuttings in the well, and to log the casing annulus after cementing. Another idea is to displace the annulus behind casings to brine to avoid settling of barite. For milling operations, the well should be cleaned properly if there is any suspicion that swarf in the well could cause prob-lems for later operations. Alternatively, new methods could be used to leave swarf downhole in the well. The SwarfPak that is discussed later in this report is one such development. </p...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringMany {{of the oil}} and gas {{fields on}} the Norwegian {{continental}} shelf (NCS) are approaching the end of field life. The Petroleum safety authority of Norway is putting pressure on the Exploration and Production (E&P) companies and demanding final field permanent plug and abandonment of several fields within a short period of time. Especially the temporary plugged and abandoned wells [1]. Over the next 5 to 25 years, several thousand wells will need to be plugged and abandoned on the NCS [2]. The conventional method for Plug and abandonment (P&A) includes casing removal by milling operations in order to access the formation for barrier placement. This conventional P&A activity is considered by E&P companies as time consuming, costly and causes additional risks related to health, safety and environment (HSE). Thus a growing interest has been put into finding new methods and solutions to reduce the time and cost of such operations. Archer recognizes this need, and has put effort in developing new intelligent concepts and technical solutions to overcome these challenges. As a result, the Perforate and Wash Tool (PWT) has been introduced. The PWT tool is designed to perforate a selected <b>casing</b> or liner <b>section,</b> wash and clean the perforated section completely, prior to placing a cross sectional cement plug. By eliminating the need for section milling and debris handling, and preparing the seal zone to receive cement, the PWT concept delivers a step change in P&A efficiency and effectiveness. Over the last years this PWT concept has been improved to increase efficiency of the P&A operation. Recently a new technique has been developed for cement placement in the perforated interval to form a permanent P&A barrier. By applying this newest cementing technique, the time to perform the whole plug placement sequence can be reduced significantly. This thesis has examined and present Archers PWT tool and investigated its advancement in the P&A operation. A case study comparing the conventional P&A method of section milling with the PWT concept has been performed. The case compare the methods with respect to time and scope for placing P&A plugs in a production well in the Ekofisk field offshore Norway. The main findings from the case study revealed a potential for significant timesaving by utilizing the PWT methods compared to section milling operations. By applying the new PWT technique the operational time to place P&A barriers in the production well was reduced by 70 %. Considering the amount of wells that are to be plugged the coming years, and the limited availability of rigs, saving time on P&A operations will be crucial for the E&P companies...|$|R
40|$|Geothermal energy {{extraction}} {{is typically}} achieved {{by use of}} long open-hole intervals {{in an attempt to}} connect the well with the greatest possible rock mass. This presents a problem for the development of Enhanced (Engineered) Geothermal Systems (EGS), owing to the challenge of obtaining uniform stimulation throughout the open-hole interval. Fluids are often injected in only a fraction of that interval, reducing heat transfer efficiency and increasing energy cost. Pinnacle Technologies, Inc. and GeothermEx, Inc. evaluated a variety of techniques and methods that are commonly used for hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells to increase and evaluate stimulation effectiveness in EGS wells. Headed by Leen Weijers, formerly Manager of Technical Development at Pinnacle Technologies, Inc., the project ran from August 1, 2004 to July 31, 2006 in two one-year periods to address the following tasks and milestones: 1) Analyze stimulation results from the closest oil-field equivalents for EGS applications in the United States (e. g., the Barnett Shale in North Texas) (section 3 on page 8). Pinnacle Technologies, Inc. has collected fracture growth data from thousands of stimulations (section 3. 1 on page 12). This data was further evaluated in the context of: a) Identifying techniques best suited to developing a stimulated EGS fracture network (section 3. 2 on page 29), and b) quantifying the growth of the network under various conditions to develop a calibrated model for fracture network growth (section 3. 3 on page 30). The developed model can be used to design optimized EGS fracture networks that maximize contact with the heat source and minimize short-circuiting (section 3. 4 on page 38). 2) Evaluate methods used in oil field applications to improve fluid diversion and penetration and determine their applicability to EGS (section 4 on page 50). These methods include, but are not limited to: a) Stimulation strategies (propped fracturing versus water fracturing versus injecting fluid below fracturing gradients) (section 4. 1 on page 50); b) zonal isolation methods (by use of perforated <b>casing</b> or packers) (<b>section</b> 4. 2 on page 57); c) fracture re-orientation and fracture network growth techniques (e. g., by use of alternating high- and low-rate injections) (section 4. 4 on page 74); and d) fluid diversion methods (by use of the SurgiFrac technique, the StimGun perforation technique, or stress shadowing). This project task is to be completed in the first project year, enabling the most promising techniques to be field tested and evaluated in the second project year. 3) Study the applicability of the methods listed above by utilizing several techniques (section 5 on page 75) including, but not limited to: a) Hydraulic Impedance Testing (HIT) to determine the location of open hydraulic fractures along a open-hole interval; b) pressure transient testing to determine reservoir permeability, pore pressure, and closure stress; and c) treatment well tilt mapping or microseismic mapping to evaluate fracture coverage. These techniques were reviewed for their potential application for EGS in the first project year (section 5. 1 on page 75). This study also includes further analysis of any field testing that will be conducted in the Desert Peak area in Nevada for ORMAT Nevada, Inc. (section 5. 2 on page 86), with the aim to close the loop to provide reliable calibrated fracture model results. Developed through its hydraulic fracture consulting business, techniques of Pinnacle Technologies, Inc. for stimulating and analyzing fracture growth have helped {{the oil and gas industry}} to improve hydraulic fracturing from both a technical and economic perspective. In addition to more than 30 years of experience in the development of geothermal energy for commercial power generation throughout the world, GeothermEx, Inc. brings to the project: 1) Detailed information about specific developed and potential EGS reservoirs, 2) experience with geothermal well design, completion, and testing practices, and 3) a direct connection to the Desert Peak EGS project...|$|R
