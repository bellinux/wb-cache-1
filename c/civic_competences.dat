40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{globalization}} process requires Europeans {{to update}} {{not only their}} specific work skills, but also to develop transversal key competences for lifelong learning (such as such as digital competence, learning to learn, social and <b>civic</b> <b>competences</b> and cultural awareness and expression) which allow a flexible and effective adaptation to a rapidly changing and strongly interconnected society. In this direction, the cultural heritage that characterizes the EU states – and school museums in particular - is an important resource for the acquisition and promotion of transversal key competences. AIM: EVIRTUS project aims to develop and test a new teaching/learning methodology {{in order to improve}} social and <b>civic</b> <b>competences,</b> based on the extensive school heritage which is preserved in the school museums of the project partners (such as school furniture, teachers' documents, pupils' kit, photographic and audio-visual materials, writing and drawing instruments etc.) and devoted to lower secondary school pupils (cf. 2 nd level of education according to ISCED). ACTIVITIES and RESULTS: 1) Create the virtual Museum of European education (MUSES), where museum-based learning paths will be available to encourage the construction of a European identity and the improvement of students’ social and <b>civic</b> <b>competences</b> 2) National articles and transnational report on EU citizenship education through school museums - specifically devoted to the scientific community 3) Printed book EVIRTUS GUIDE: becoming EU citizens through EU school museums, i. e. a practical manual devoted to lower secondary school teachers and school museums operators 4) Online and printed versions of the EVIRTUS GUIDELINES: how can we become European through school museums? devoted to policy makers and educational authorities (such as town councillors, education superintendents, education ministerial executives, etc.) ...|$|E

The data and scales used are from the IEA 1999 international Civic Education study of 14 -year-olds in school.

Approach: Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were adapted in this study. A survey was used as the Quantitative approach and for the in-depth understanding, interviews were used as the qualitative approach. The population of this research was students from Junior High School in West Java Indonesia.

It was expected that there is a negative relationship between the two and therefore the higher a person’s democratic citizenship skills the lower their radicalization. Method: A person’s democratic citizenship skills were measured by the survey ‘Burgerschapscompetenties’, developed by the University of Amsterdam, leading to individual <b>civic</b> <b>competences</b> scores. To measure a person’s stage of radicalization, group interviews with 15 adolescents were held. According to Borum’s (2003) model of the four-stage process of radicalization statement from the interviews were encoded and respondents were assigned to a level of radicalization. Both scores have been compared to examine their suspected relationship. Results: An analysis of both scores showed there was no negative or positive relationship between <b>civic</b> <b>competences</b> and the level of radicalization. These results can be explained by analyzing the qualitative data as well as the research process. Conclusion: According to the results, the hypothesis must be rejected. There seems to be no negative relationship between democratic citizenship and the process of radicalization.

In most educational systems, school {{are free to}} design their civic and citizenship education curricula and pedagogical objectives and practices may vary. Understanding the possible influence of school factors on civic and citizenship competences remains a difficult task. This dissertation aims to {{shed some light on}} the contribution of schools and the wider learning environment to the acquisition of civic and citizenship competences in lower secondary education. We use a theoretical framework based on educational effectiveness research and present empirical findings estimated across several educational systems and democratic contexts. The results show that citizenship learning depends strongly on students’ background, their motivation, the opportunities they have to learn, discuss and practice democracy outside school, as well as on aspects of the school quality. Although the school appears to play a modest role, we find that school experiences are promoting the acquisition of cognitive outcomes (civic knowledge and skills) and to a less extent the acquisition of non-cognitive outcomes (attitudes, values, behavioral dispositions). The findings tend to suggest the possibility that different school characteristics may be linked to different <b>civic</b> <b>competences</b> and that curricular approaches that foster simultaneously all outcomes are difficult to develop. Nevertheless, we find that stimulating a democratic classroom climate in which free dialogue and critical debate on controversial political and social issues are encouraged is highly important in promoting effectively all types of <b>civic</b> <b>competences...</b>|$|E

This situation is not a fictional one. It depicts the findings of a cross-national longitudinal survey. How come a generation which had not been exposed to the influence of civic education performed better in <b>civic</b> <b>competences</b> as compared with their followers a decade later? Who is to blame? The school teachers – for not having fulfilled their obligations? The school system – for failing to accomplish its socialization task? Or the particular civic education program – for being fake or ill-designed? Or may be we, the social scientists, have been unduly naïve about our expectations of civic education and its implementation in schools? The more important question is: to what extent does civic education fit in naturally with school life without clashing with it? Or put in another way, isn’t the classical tradition in the modern school essentially in contradiction with civic education? This problem takes the particular (Bulgarian) case beyond the boundaries of its national specificityand situates it at the level of a much more general question of the limits and preconditions of applicability of civic education, especially in regard to the expectation that it will form active citizens, capable of improving the democratic self-regulation of modern societies. The paper argues that the results of civic education should not be assessed in abstract form apart from the major factors concerning the socio-cultural, institutional and educational context. They are significantly dependent on the character of the national curriculum and the socialization programme specific for each country. Furthermore, schools, in their turn, are highly dependent on the role of civil society in the respective national societies, which feature vastly varying political cultures. The large portion of very low education achievements cannot be adduced to civic education per se, but to the wider alienation of young people from school life...|$|E

The European Commission has listed <b>civic</b> <b>competence</b> as one of the key competences to be developed under the EU Lifelong Learning strategy. This report describes the development of a measurement model along four dimensions of <b>civic</b> <b>competence</b> using the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) to monitor the levels of youth citizenship (young people aged about 14) across Europe. The model combines the traditions in Europe of liberal, civic republican and critical/cosmopolitan concepts of citizenship. Results suggest that Social justice values and Citizenship knowledge and skills of students are facilitated within the Nordic system that combines a stable democracy and economic prosperity with democratically-based education systems in which teachers prioritise the promotion of autonomous critical thinking in citizenship education. In contrast, medium term democracies with civic republican tradition, such as Italy and Greece gain more positive results on Citizenship Values and Participatory attitudes. This is also the case for some recent former communist countries that retain ethnic notions of citizenship. Yet, what emerges from this study is that the Nordic teachers’ priority on developing critical and autonomous citizens may not be sufficient to enhance participatory attitudes or concepts of a good citizen, which may be better supported by the Italian teachers’ priority on civic responsibility.

The main conclusions are that there is some degree of a Europeanization of the Swedish upper secondary regarding digital competence and entrepreneurship however not as much in the social and <b>civic</b> <b>competences</b> where democracy has been a central part in Swedish education since the 1950 s. The changes in the curriculum are not exclusively by the influence of the European Union. the globalisation and a change towards service society is also a key factor.

The empirical material consists of European policy documents produced during 2000 - 2015. The two central research questions explore (1) how European career guidance is made governable, and (2) how individuals’ career management is constructed and governed. The Foucauldian governmentality perspective and the analytic method of problematization is utilized. The analysis focuses on the compositions of normative forms of reason, discursive practices and techniques by which governing is exercised and knowledge is produced. The thesis is based on four articles, three of which concern career guidance and career management. The fourth article concerns education of citizenship. The analysis shows that {{the formation of a}} policy space for comparison of national systems of career guidance is significant for making European career guidance amenable to governance. It is mobilized by governing practices for involvement of institutional actors and the construction of standards of performance. This form of governance becomes effective on the condition that institutional actors use and produce knowledge and practices about what works in career guidance, and this implies self-control and constant monitoring. It is a complex process of producing self-regulation of career guidance adjustable to change and innovation in which both standardization and modulation are inbuilt. Moreover, this is dependent on the interplay of governance and self-government. Knowledge and practices shape career management as an individual competence, which each individual is assumed to achieve. The use of guidance techniques supporting this design and self-regulating practices contributes to responsibilizing individuals to achieve this competence. Knowledge of individuals’ management of their careers includes <b>civic</b> <b>competence.</b> This led me to extend my use of the theoretical framework to investigate how knowledge of <b>civic</b> <b>competence</b> is constructed in European policy documents concerning teacher education from 2000 to 2012. My analysis shows that presumptions of teaching <b>civic</b> <b>competence</b> support the production of the active and learning subject...|$|R

30|$|The {{concept of}} economic-civic {{competence}} combines {{the concepts of}} economic <b>competence</b> and <b>civic</b> <b>competence</b> (see Eberle 2015). There are research traditions in both economic competence/education (e.g., Wuttke et al. 2016) and civic competence/education (e.g., Print and Lange 2013). Given that civic demands (e.g., referenda) are often related to economic problems on the individual or social level, the weak connection between these two research areas is surprising. Our definition of economic-civic competence is outlined {{in the next section}} and considers both research approaches. A more detailed description of our model of economic-civic competence is outlined in Eberle et al. (2016).|$|R
