40|$|Background/purpose: Several all-ceramic {{materials}} {{have been developed}} to meet the most challenging requirements in restorative dentistry. However, only limited reports have focused on the issue of biocompatibility of all-ceramics. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of different types of all-ceramic substructural materials to determine their biological performance under experimental conditions. Materials and methods: We tested six all-ceramic systems [glass-infiltrated alumina-reinforced ceramic (In-Ceram Alumina, Turkom Cera), glass-infiltrated zirconia-toughened alumina ceramic (In-Ceram Zirconia), low-fusing ceramic (Finesse), yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia ceramic (Zirkonzahn), and lithium disilicate glass ceramic (IPS e. max) ] using a tetrazolium assay prior to and 3 days after aging, to determine their ability to alter <b>cellular</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> activity. Mann–Whitney U test and Wilcoxon t test were used for statistical analysis (α =  0. 05). Results: According to the results of the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl-thiazol- 2 yl-) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide tests, the toxic effects of Finesse and Zirkonzahn were statistically insignificant (P >  0. 05) compared with the negative control group. In contrast, In-Ceram Alumina, In-Ceram Zirconia, Turkom Cera, and IPS e. max demonstrated statistically significant toxic effects (P <  0. 05) compared to the negative control group. When effects of aging on cytotoxic properties were evaluated, In-Ceram Zirconia and Turkom Cera showed increased cytotoxic effects on the 1 st day following the aging process, whereas IPS e. max and Zirkonzahn displayed cytotoxic effects on the 2 nd day and Day 7, respectively. The cytotoxic effect of Zirkonzahn and IPS e. max was decreased on the 1 st day and at the 2 nd week, respectively. Conclusion: Several types of all-ceramic substructures did not cause the same in vitro responses. Finesse and Zirkonzahn did not carry high biologic risk. However, our results suggest that In-Ceram Alumina, In-Ceram Zirconia, Turkom Cera, and IPS e. max should not be considered as entirely biocompatible materials...|$|E

We hypothesized that levulinate is converted in the liver to 4 -hydroxypentanoate, a new drug of abuse, and that this conversion is accelerated by ethanol oxidation. We confirmed these hypotheses in live rats, perfused rat livers, and liver subcellular preparations. Levulinate is reduced to (R) - 4 -hydroxypentanoate by a cytosolic and a <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>dehydrogenase,</b> which are NADPH- and NADH-dependent, respectively. A <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> or racemase system also forms (S) - 4 -hydroxypentanoate. In livers perfused with [13 C 5]levulinate, there was substantial CoA trapping in levulinyl-CoA, 4 -hydroxypentanoyl-CoA, and 4 -phosphopentanoyl-CoA. This CoA trapping was increased by ethanol, with a 6 -fold increase in the concentration of 4 -phosphopentanoyl-CoA. Levulinate is catabolized by 3 parallel pathways to propionyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, and lactate. Most intermediates of the 3 pathways were identified by mass isotopomer analysis and metabolomics. The production of 4 -hydroxypentanoate from levulinate and its stimulation by ethanol is a potential public health concern...|$|R

X-ray diffraction studies established that all complexes contain the AMMT molecule, which are coordinated {{to the central}} metal ion in the thione tautomeric form. At the ratio M : L = 1 : 2 ligand is coordinated in bidentate chelate manner by the nitrogen of amino- and sulfur of mercapto group (compounds 1, 3). But the molar ratio M : L = 1 : 4 leads to monodentate coordination of AMMT molecules only by sulfur of mercaptogroup (complex 2). Vacant coordination sites of the metal ion are occupied by water molecules (complex 3). The screening of complexes 1 − 3 and starting compounds [АММТ, K 2 PdCl 4 (4), Ni(NO 3) 2 ∙ 6 H 2 O (5) ] by their <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> activity have been performed by us for the first time, resulting in established that the Pd(II) complexes (1, 2), Pd(II) salt (4) and AMMT normalize the activity of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> of cancer HeLa cells, identified by MTT-test.

40|$|Aim: The {{composition}} of the meibum of blepharitis patients is characterised by increased levels of branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) that return to normal values in patients treated with cyclins and lid hygiene. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if BCFAs had toxic effects on conjunctival cells related to the disease. Methods: Chang and IOBA-NHC conjunctival human cells were treated with BCFAs (isoC 16 and isoC 20) or palmitic acid as a control for 4 h or 24 h at 50 μM or 100 μM. Morphological and functional changes were investigated by measuring <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> activity, cell permeability, mitochondrial depolarisation, chromatin condensation, IL- 1 β and reactive oxygen species production. Results: None of the fatty acids modified the parameters of cytotoxicity in conjunctival cells in Chang or IOBA-NHC cell lines. Only the <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> activity was significantly decreased in relation to the isoC 20 concentration increase. Conclusions: The increase in BCFAs in the tears of blepharitis patients does not consistently participate in the conjunctival cell changes throughout the course of the disease.

40|$|The reoxidation of NADH {{generated}} in reactions within the mitochondrial matrix of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is catalyzed by an NADH dehydrogenase designated Ndi 1 p (C. A. M. Marres, S. de Vries, and L. A. Grivell, Eur. J. Biochem. 195 : 857 – 862, 1991). Gene disruption {{analysis was used}} to examine possible metabolic functions of two proteins encoded by open reading frames having significant primary sequence similarity to Ndi 1 p. Disruption of the gene designated NDH 1 results in a threefold reduction in total <b>mitochondrial</b> NADH <b>dehydrogenase</b> activity in cells cultivated with glucose and in a fourfold reduction in the respiration of isolated mitochondria with NADH as the substrate. Thus, Ndh 1 p appears to be a <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> capable of using exogenous NADH. Disruption of a closely related gene designated NDH 2 has no effect on these properties. Growth phenotype analyses suggest that the external NADH dehydrogenase activity of Ndh 1 p is important for optimum cellular growth with a number of nonfermentable carbon sources, including ethanol. Codisruption of NDH 1 and genes encoding malate dehydrogenases essentially eliminates growth on nonfermentable carbon sources, suggesting that the external <b>mitochondrial</b> NADH <b>dehydrogenase</b> and the malate-aspartate shuttle may both contribute to reoxidation of cytosolic NADH under these growth conditions...|$|R

Experiments {{were carried out}} to evaluate the effects of diethyl maleate or phorone, agents that deplete GSH from the liver, on the oxidation of formaldehyde. The addition of diethyl maleate or phorone to intact mitochondria or to disrupted mitochondrial fractions produced inhibition of formaldehyde oxidation. The kinetics of inhibition of the low-Km <b>mitochondrial</b> aldehyde <b>dehydrogenase</b> were mixed. Mitochondria isolated from rats treated in vivo with diethyl maleate or phorone had a decreased capacity to oxidize either formaldehyde or acetaldehyde. The activity of the low-Km, but not the high-Km, <b>mitochondrial</b> aldehyde <b>dehydrogenase</b> was also inhibited. The production of CO 2 plus formate from 0. 2 mM-[14 C]formaldehyde by isolated hepatocytes was only slightly inhibited (15 - 30 %) by incubation with diethyl maleate or addition of cyanamide, suggesting oxidation primarily via formaldehyde dehydrogenase. However, the production of CO 2 plus formate was increased 2. 5 -fold when the concentration of [14 C]formaldehyde was raised to 1 mM. This increase in product formation at higher formaldehyde concentrations was much more sensitive to inhibition by diethyl maleate or cyanamide, suggesting an important contribution by <b>mitochondrial</b> aldehyde <b>dehydrogenase.</b> Thus diethyl maleate and phorone, besides depleting GSH, can also serve as effective inhibitors in vivo or in vitro of the low-Km <b>mitochondrial</b> aldehyde <b>dehydrogenase.</b> Inhibition of formaldehyde oxidation by these agents {{could be due to}} impairment of both enzyme systems known to be capable of oxidizing formaldehyde.

A solid-phase, sequestratable delivery agent for local delivery of metals could reduce systemic toxicity, facilitating new drug development in this nascent area. Amorphous peroxotitanates (APT) are ion exchange materials with high affinity for several heavy metal ions, and have been proposed to deliver or sequester metal ions in biological contexts. In the current study, we tested a hypothesis that APT are able to deliver metals or metal compounds to cells. We exposed fibroblasts (L 929) or monocytes (THP 1) to metal-APT materials for 72 h in vitro, then measured <b>cellular</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> activity (SDH-MTT method) to assess the biological impact of the metal-APT materials vs. metals or APT alone. APT alone did not significantly affect <b>cellular</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> activity, but all metal-APT materials suppressed the mitochondrial activity of fibroblasts (by 30 - 65 % of controls). The concentration of metal-APT materials required to suppress <b>cellular</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> activity was below that required for metals alone, suggesting that simple extracellular release of the metals from the metal-APT materials was not the primary mechanism of mitochondrial suppression. In contrast to fibroblasts, no metal-APT material had a measurable effect on THP 1 monocyte mitochondrial activity, despite potent suppression by metals alone. This latter result suggested that 'biodelivery' by metal-APT materials may be cell type-specific. Therefore, it appears that APT are plausible solid phase delivery agents of metals or metal compounds to some types of cells for potential therapeutic effect...|$|R

Here we studied the mitochondrial response to application of Ca 2 + at buffered concentrations in permeabilized rat adrenal glomerulosa cells, in an insulin-producing cell line (INS- 1 /EK- 3) and in an osteosarcoma cell line (143 BmA- 13). Mitochondrial Ca 2 + concentration was measured with the fluorescent dye rhod- 2 and, using an in situ calibration method, with the mitochondrially targeted luminescent protein mt-aequorin. In both endocrine cell types, mitochondrial Ca 2 + concentration increased in response to elevated cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration (between 60 and 740 nM) and an increase in mitochondrial Ca 2 + concentration could be revealed already at a cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration step from 60 - 140 nM. Similar responses were observed in the osteosarcoma cell line, although a clearcut response was first observed at 280 nM extramitochondrial Ca 2 + only. As examined in glomerulosa cells, graded increases in cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration were associated with graded increases in the reduction of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides, consistent with Ca 2 +-dependent activation of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>dehydrogenases.</b> Our data indicate that in addition to the recognized role of high-Ca 2 + cytoplasmic microdomains, also small Ca 2 + signals may influence mitochondrial metabolism...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn yeast, {{there is}} a {{constant}} growth yield during proliferation on non-fermentable substrate where the ATP generated originates from oxidative phosphorylation.

Moreover, the Ras/cAMP pathway is the cellular signaling pathway involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, with a direct relationship between the activity of this pathway and the cellular amount of mitochondria. The cAMP protein kinase Tpk 3 p is the catalytic subunit specifically involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis through regulation of the mitochondrial ROS production. An overflow of mitochondrial ROS decreases mitochondrial biogenesis through a decrease in the transcriptional co-activator Hap 4 p, which can be assimilated to mitochondria quality control.
