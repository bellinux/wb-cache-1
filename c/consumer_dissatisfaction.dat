40|$|In this dissertation, I {{examined}} the effects of national culture on the consumer complaint behavior. I used individualism as the independent variable characterizing the cultural predispositions of respondents. To ensure variability of the cultural characteristic of individualism, I collected the data from demographically matched samples of adult consumers from the United States (presumed to be individualistic) and South Korea (presumed to be collectivistic) using a survey methodology. I used structural equation modeling approach to assess the measurement model, measurement equivalence of constructs between the two samples, and the hypothesized structural paths between the constructs. ^ Generally, the results indicate that individualism, as an individual-level cultural characteristic, affects consumer complaint behavior reflected in <b>consumer</b> voicing <b>dissatisfaction</b> stemming from unsatisfactory marketplace experience with the business at fault and in negative word of mouth. However, the effects vary within the different contexts and within the national samples under study. ^ Additionally, the results provide evidence of mediation of the relationship between individualism and consumer complaining behavior by individual-level psychological variables such as consumer aggressiveness, and consumer self-confidence, and consumer altruism. Moreover, the results indicate that severity of the dissatisfactory experience and level of anticipation of resolution of the dissatisfactory experience are both important predictors of the propensity to engage in complaining behavior. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{importance}} of evaluation criteria was hypothesized to positively influence consumer satisfaction with knitwear and negatively influence <b>consumer</b> <b>dissatisfaction.</b> Satisfaction {{was affected by}} only an evaluation of intrinsic criteria, not social and economic criteria. Consumers who importantly considered design, color, fabric, comfort, and workmanship (intrinsic criteria) were satisfied with knitwear products. S d quality. Regarding the relationship between evaluative criteria and <b>consumer</b> <b>dissatisfaction,</b> only social criteria negatively influenced <b>consumer</b> <b>dissatisfaction,</b> while intrinsic criteria had a significant, positive association with <b>consumer</b> <b>dissatisfaction.</b> Interestingly, when consumers considered intrinsic criteria importantly to evaluate knitwear products, they were shown as more likely to satisfy as well as dissatisfy with the products. Especially for knitwear, consumers purchase and wear the products because of its soft texture, stretch, comfort, and insulation (Ryu 2002). Knitwear is much more sensitive to quality and workmanship compared to other apparel product categories (Hong et al. 2002). Thus, when evaluating the knitwear products, the importance may be in its design, color, fabric, comfort, and workmanship. The enhanced perceived {{importance of}} intrinsic criteria by consumers may make them deliberately evaluate the products based on objective information, which makes them more likely to satisfy or dissatisfy.

40|$|In the past, {{research}} on <b>consumer</b> <b>dissatisfaction</b> with legal services {{tended to be}} quantitative in nature, and focused primarily on consumer opinion of the legal profession. These quantitative studies have been valuable in gaining {{a basic understanding of}} consumer consensus of legal services and the legal profession. However, a qualitative understanding of the complexity of the personal dissatisfaction experience with legal services, as well as the psychological and social meanings and consequences of these experiences, is an important contribution to the literature. This dissertation provides a qualitative view of the experience of <b>consumer</b> <b>dissatisfaction</b> with legal services in Manhattan, NY. An interpretative phenomenological analysis using semi-structured interviews was used to examine the dissatisfaction experiences of four participants. The analysis resulted in five super-ordinate themes and their accompanying sub-themes. The super-ordinate themes are: (a) disconfirmation of expectations leads to alienation, (b) rationalizing disconfirmation experience, (c) resisting alienation by developing coping mechanisms, (d) psychological reactions, and (e) desire for measures that would confirm expectations. The study used existing literature to clarify the results, and make recommendations.

5000|$|The post {{purchase}} {{stage is}} where the consumer examines and comparies product features, such as price, functionality, and quality with their expectations. Post purchase evaluation {{can be viewed as}} the steps taken by consumers to correlate their expectations with perceived value, and thus influences the consumer’s next purchase decision for that good or service. For example, if a consumer buys a new phone and his or her post-purchase evaluation is positive, he/she will be encouraged to purchase the same brand or from the same company in the future. This is also known as [...] "post-purchase intention". On the contrary, if a consumer is dissatisfied with the new phone, he or she may take actions to resolve the <b>dissatisfaction.</b> <b>Consumer</b> actions, in this instance, could involve requesting a refund, making a complaint, deciding not to purchase the same brand or from the same company in the future or even spreading negative product reviews to friends or acquaintances, possibly via social media.|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{energy demand}} in {{developing}} countries {{is expected to rise}} significantly by the year 2020. To achieve electrical grid operational reliability the electrical grid operators need to keep a balance between their generation and consumption curve. The increase in demand requires expansion in the current generation capacity. This expansion can be achieved by bringing more green and renewable electrical energy generation resources into the electrical grid system. Keeping the electrical generation and distribution system in stable form at all times is a very complex task. Electricity utilities need to keep a balance between generation and consumption curves in order to achieve reliable grid operations. Grid operators have used many techniques to achieve reliability in grid operations. Demand-side management and demand response strategies are examples of a few of those techniques. “Smart grid” is the overall solution of most of these problems. However, smart grid has its own pros and cons. On the other hand, electrical energy consumers at present are not actively participating in the operations of electrical grids. This lack of participation is both in developed and developing countries. Research has shown that benefits were achieved when electrical energy consumers participated in the electrical grid operations. Grid operators in the past have used different demand response strategies to minimize this gap of interaction between the electrical energy consumers and electricity utilities. Demand response programs or strategies used at present are predominantly for commercial or large electrical energy consumers. There are very few of the demand response strategies deployed for domestic electrical energy consumers. All the present demand response strategies are utility-based strategies, that is electricity utilities have full control over a domestic consumer’s electrical energy consumption. When required utilities can switch the appliance ON or OFF in a domestic consumer’s household. This utility driven strategy can result in <b>consumer’s</b> <b>dissatisfaction.</b> Utilities need to offer demand response programs for the domestic electrical energy consumers. However offering consumer based demand response programs require the active participation from the consumer’s side. Electricity utilities must provide their consumers with the information about their electrical energy consumption in realtime. This requires equipment that can monitor electrical energy consumption in realtime and send it back to the utility and the consumer. Smart meters have been used to serve the purpose, however they have their problems. The domestic consumer needs to be onsite (at his home) in order to benefit from the information displayed on a smart meter. Since domestic consumers are not at home at all times the information displayed on the smart meter is not useful. This makes the use of smart meters inefficient. This dissertation proposes a system based on the concept of smart power sockets which can be used at a domestic electrical energy consumer’s household in order to monitor their electrical energy in real-time and alert them about their electrical energy consumption when required. These smart power sockets also enable the consumers to control their appliance remotely (to switch them ON or OFF when required). The prototype system has been developed and tested. The results suggest that domestic electrical energy consumers reacted to the information provided to them about their electrical energy information. Based on the information provided the domestic electrical energy consumer was able to reduce his/her electrical energy consumption. In some cases it is also noticed that the domestic electrical energy consumer shifted some of his/her load from peak time of electrical energy demand to the off peak time. Based on these results it is recommended that electricity utilities must consider offering demand response programs that are mainly driven by the domestic electrical energy consumers themselves...|$|R
