25|$|The early park concessioners {{received}} little supervision. Their structures were typical makeshift frontier efforts. Not {{until after the}} completion of the northern transcontinental railroads in the 1890s, did more advanced <b>concessioner</b> facilities appear in Yellowstone, for example. Among the first of these was the Lake Hotel, constructed by the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1890.

5000|$|In 1993, Karl and Rita Girshman, a Jewish couple, {{were visiting}} Big Bend National Park and were {{disturbed}} {{by one of}} the students serving with ACMNP. The couple sued and forced several changes in the way ACMNP, the NPS, and park <b>concessioners</b> operated. Prior to the suit, ACMNP used the distinctive arrow head used by the NPS on most of its correspondence. As a result of the suit, the NPS was forced to crack down on who and under what circumstances the arrow head could be used. <b>Concessioners</b> were barred from using religious affiliation in their hiring practices. Prior to the court case, ACMNP was able to guarantee employment with many of the park <b>concessioners</b> as it had arrangements to place students at various locations. As part of the settlement, the NPS sent a letter stating, that it would be against the law to [...] "reserve or set aside jobs for individuals affiliated with one religious group or another... Employment discrimination by our <b>concessioners</b> will not be tolerated." [...] Many parks made exceptions to ACMNP obtaining permits; after the case, ACMNP activities required obtaining permits just as any other group would. [...] "We think we've accomplished a lot more than we initially thought we could because of the intimate ties that the Christian Ministry had developed with the government," [...] Karl Girshman said. [...] "In most parks, they had a monopoly. They had been reserving amphitheaters, campfire circles and other public gathering places long in advance.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{analyzing}} {{the contribution of}} <b>concessioners</b> to the recovery of national economy and social sphere of the Lower Volga region, {{as well as the}} role of foreign workers and specialists in the construction of new enterprises and the modernization of functioning ones in Stalingrad in 1920 - 1930 s. The concessional enterprises were set up in the agricultural sector of the Lower Volga region. The <b>concessioners</b> introduced new farming technologies and grain varieties. However, the sustainable results in the agricultural industry of the region were not achieved. The authors analyze the labor conditions and the balance between Soviet and foreign labor force at the following agricultural concessions: “Doctor Nansen” (philanthropic), “Nemvolbank” (Soviet-German) and “Druag” (German subconcession of “Nemvolbank”). The article highlights the peculiarities of remuneration system at concessionary enterprises. The authors reveal that the social and labor relations at the concessionary enterprises were regulated according to the Soviet labor code and the wage level of the agricultural concessions’ workers was higher than at the state-owned farms. In the absence of the Soviet government support, the <b>concessioners</b> dealt with the problem of workers accommodation defusing thereby the housing crisis in the USSR and boosting the concessional workers living standards. Besides, the concessioners’ activity contributed to the Soviet population employment and the development of the social and cultural environment at the enterprises...|$|R
50|$|Automobiles {{remained}} {{banned in}} Yellowstone {{long after they}} were admitted in other national parks, due {{to the influence of}} Child and the Northern Pacific. In 1916, {{as part of an effort}} to exert Park Service control over <b>concessioners,</b> Park Service director Stephen Mather dictated a settlement between Yellowstone <b>concessioners</b> that sold all of Haynes' interests apart from his photography business to Child, while Child gave up his interest in the Wylie camping operation to a new organization, in return for the park's motorized transportation concession. As a result of this deal, Child became the beneficiary of three railroads: the Northern Pacific, the Union Pacific, and the Burlington. Child used the railroads' resources to borrow money for a fleet of custom-built White Motor Company touring buses and touring cars. Child closed the Fountain Hotel, which was no longer needed as a relay point.|$|R

25|$|In {{those early}} parks where the Interior Department {{retained}} administrative responsibility (including Crater Lake, Mount Rainier and Glacier), government buildings usually {{were limited to}} primitive, vernacular expressions of facility need.

40|$|Modern {{political}} leverage {{from western}} countries to Russia allows researchers to use domestic historical experience of 1920 - 1940 s. International isolation of Soviet Russia induced {{the search of}} different ways out, including making concessionary agreements with foreign entrepreneurs. Since 1921 concessionary agreements were made between Soviet Russia/USSR and Germany, England, USA, Japan, Norway, Poland, Austria, Italy, France, Persia, Denmark, Finland, Latvia, Holland, Sweden, Estonia, Lithuania, Turkey, China and Mongolia. Soviet economy began attracting private foreign capital. At {{the end of the}} 1920 s Soviet government set a course to liquidate private property. Share of concessionary enterprises in the national economy decreased. But despite the absence of any new concessionary agreements since 1929, concessionary affairs in USSR lasted till mid- 1940 and only with Japan because of its deep political meaning. The author analyzes Japan concessions’ activity, such as “Kita Karafuto Koogio Kabusiki Kaisha” and “Kita Karafuto Sekio Kabusiki Kaisha” in 1930 - 1940 s (pre- and World War II period), workers’ socio-economic conditions, relations between Japanese <b>concessioners</b> and Soviet authorities. Permanent infringements of concessionary agreements by Japan <b>concessioners</b> including concessions workers’ food and goods supply, price making, Soviet workers’ housing provision and dismissal, meeting safety requirements were registered. However, neither Japan <b>concessioners</b> dissolve their enterprises nor Soviet authorities annulled concessionary agreements. The author concludes that originally in 1925 granting concessions to Japan businessmen in USSR was among the conditions of Japan government diplomatic recognition of USSR. Further Japan concessions in USSR were deterrent factor from Japan military invasion to the Russian Far East...|$|R
