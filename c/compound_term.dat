40|$|In [11], we {{proposed}} an algebra with four algebraic operators, whose composition {{can be used}} to generate valid <b>compound</b> <b>terms</b> in a given faceted taxonomy in an efficient and flexible manner. The positive operations allow the derivation of valid <b>compound</b> <b>terms</b> through the declaration of a small set of valid <b>compound</b> <b>terms.</b> The negative operations allow the derivation of valid <b>compound</b> <b>terms</b> through the declaration of a small set of invalid <b>compound</b> <b>terms.</b> Here, we formally define the model-theoretic semantics of the operations and the closedworld assumptions adopted in each operation. We prove that our algebra is monotonic with respect to both valid and invalid <b>compound</b> <b>terms,</b> meaning that the valid and invalid <b>compound</b> <b>terms</b> of a subexpression are not invalidated by a larger expression. The importance of this property is demonstrated through an example. We also show that our algebra cannot be directly represented in Description Logics.

40|$|Most {{existing}} {{systems of}} Information retrieval (IR) use single words as index {{to represent the}} contents of documents and queries. One of the consequences is the low recall level. In this paper, we propose to integrate <b>compound</b> <b>terms</b> as additional indexing units because terms are more precise representation units than words. Terms are recognized {{through the use of}} a terminology database and an automatic term extraction tool, which is based on syntactic templates and statistical analysis. In this paper, we first show that the use of <b>compound</b> <b>terms</b> is greatly beneficial to monolingual IR. Then <b>compound</b> <b>terms</b> are incorporated in statistical translation models trained on a large set of parallel texts. Our experiments on cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) show that such a translation model leads to a much better CLIR effectiveness when <b>compound</b> <b>terms</b> are integrated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Medical {{vocabulary}} is complex, expanding, and convoluted {{not least}} {{because of the large}} numbers of <b>compound</b> <b>terms.</b> Formalized medical terminologies such as SNOMED-CT and ICD- 10 take one of two strategies when representing medical language: so-called pre-coordination where valid <b>compound</b> <b>terms</b> are included explicitly in the terminologies and so-called post-coordination where the terminology consists of a basis and a generative function from which the <b>compound</b> <b>terms</b> may be derived. However, these notions are not used with particular precision in the literature. In this paper, we provide a formalization of the notion of coordination, a technique for estimating the degree of coordination in a given system, and an examination, based on our technique, of the coordination level of a number of major existing terminologies...|$|R

6000|$|... "Under this head, of language, may be mentioned, {{though not}} with strict {{grammatical}} accuracy, two standing {{characteristics of the}} Professor's style,--at least as rendered into English: First, the composition of words, such as 'snow-and-rosebloom maiden:' an attractive damsel doubtless in Germany, but, with all her charms, somewhat uncouth here. 'Life-vision' is another example; and many more might be found. To {{say nothing of the}} innumerable cases in which the words are only intelligible as a <b>compound</b> <b>term,</b> though not distinguished by hyphens. Of course the composition of words is sometimes allowable even in English: but the habit of dealing with German seems to have produced, in the pages before us, a prodigious superabundance of this form of expression; which gives harshness and strangeness, where the matter would at all events have been surprising enough. Secondly, I object, with the same qualification, to the frequent use of inversion; which generally appears as a transposition of the two members of a clause, in a way which would not have been practiced in conversation. It certainly gives emphasis and force, and often serves to point the meaning. But a style may be fatiguing and faulty precisely by being too emphatic, forcible and pointed; and so straining the attention to find its meaning, or the admiration to appreciate its beauty.|$|E
