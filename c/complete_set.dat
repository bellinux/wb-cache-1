40|$|If all NP <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> are {{isomorphic}} under deterministic {{polynomial time}} mappings (p-isomorphic) then P ≠ NP {{and if all}} PTAPE <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> are p-isomorphic then P ≠ PTAPE. We show that all NP <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> known (in the literature) are indeed p-isomorphic {{and so are the}} known PTAPE <b>complete</b> <b>sets.</b> Thus showing that, in spite of the radically different origins and attempted simplification of these sets, all the known NP <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> are identical but for polynomially time bounded permutations. Furthermore, if all NP <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> are p-isomorphic then they must have similar densities and, for example, no language over a single letter alphabet can be NP complete, nor can any sparse language over an arbitrary alphabet be NP complete. We show that <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> in EXPTIME and EXPTAPE cannot be sparse and therefore they cannot be over a single letter alphabet. Similarly, we show that the hardest context-sensitive languages cannot be sparse. We also relate the existence of sparse <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> to the existence of simple combinatorial circuits for the corresponding truncated recognition problem of these languages...|$|R

40|$|Mutually {{unbiased}} bases (MUBs) {{are important}} in quantum information theory. While constructions of <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> of d + 1 MUBs in C-d are known when d is a prime power, it is unknown if such <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> exist in non-prime power dimensions. It has been conjectured that <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> of MUBs only exist in if a maximal set of mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) of side length d also exists. There are several constructions (Roy and Scott 2007 J. Math. Phys. 48 072110; Paterek, Daki? and Brukner 2009 Phys. Rev. A 79 012109) of <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> of MUBs from specific types of MOLS, which use Galois fields to construct the vectors of the MUBs.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{construction}} method for <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> of cyclic mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) in Hilbert spaces of even prime power dimensions. In comparison to usual <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> of MUBs, <b>complete</b> cyclic <b>sets</b> possess the additional property of being {{generated by a}} single unitary operator. The construction method {{is based on the}} idea of obtaining a partition of multi-qubit Pauli operators into maximal commuting sets of orthogonal operators {{with the help of a}} suitable element of the Clifford group. As a consequence, we explicitly obtain <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> of cyclic MUBs generated by a single element of the Clifford group in dimensions $ 2 ^m$ for $m= 1, 2, [...] ., 24 $.

40|$|The {{properties}} {{and structure of}} <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> for exponential-time classes are surveyed. Strong reductions, those implying many-one completeness, are considered as strengthenings of the usual completeness notions. From the results on strong reductions, immunity properties of <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> are derived. Differences are shown between <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> arising from the various polynomial-time reductions. These include most of the "weak" reduction between p m and p T. Finally we consider <b>complete</b> <b>sets</b> for some other classes such as r. e. sets along with structural properties of these <b>sets.</b> 1 Introduction <b>Complete</b> problems play a central and defining role in complexity theory. They are the canonical sets within a complexity class, are almost always the only sets which arise naturally within a class and as such are the most thoroughly studied.
