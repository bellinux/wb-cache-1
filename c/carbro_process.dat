50|$|Returning to New York in 1929, Outerbridge {{opened a}} studio {{producing}} commercial and artistic work, and began writing a monthly column on color photography for the U.S. Camera Magazine. Outerbridge became {{known for the}} high quality of his color illustrations, made by an extremely complex tri-color <b>carbro</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{the market}} crash, Muray {{turned away from}} celebrity and {{theatrical}} portraiture, and become a pioneering commercial photographer, famous for his creation {{of many of the}} conventions of color advertising. He was considered the master of the three-color <b>carbro</b> <b>process.</b> His last important public portraits were of Dwight David Eisenhower in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{technical}} innovations {{of the years}} 1935 to 1942, {{the only way to}} create a subtractive full-color print or transparency was by means of one of several labor-intensive and time-consuming procedures. Most commonly, three pigment images were first created separately by the so-called carbon process and then carefully combined in register. Sometimes, related processes were used to make three gelatin matrices which were dyed and assembled or used to transfer the three dye images into a single layer of gelatin coated on a final support. Chemical toning could be used to convert three black-and-white silver images into cyan, magenta and yellow images which were then assembled. In a few processes, the three images were created one on top of another by repeated coating or re-sensitizing, negative registration, exposure and development operations. A number of variations were devised and marketed {{during the first half of}} the 20th century, some of them short-lived, others, such as the Trichrome <b>Carbro</b> <b>process,</b> enduring for several decades. Because some of these processes allow very stable and light-fast coloring matter to be used, yielding images which can remain virtually unchanged for centuries, they are still not quite completely extinct.|$|E
2500|$|The {{additive}} RGB {{model and}} variants such as orange–green–violet {{were also used}} in the Autochrome Lumière color plates and other screen-plate technologies such as the Joly color screen and the Paget process {{in the early twentieth}} century. Color photography by taking three separate plates was used by other pioneers, such as the Russian Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky in the period 1909 through 1915. [...] Such methods lasted until about 1960 using the expensive and extremely complex tri-color <b>carbro</b> Autotype <b>process.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1939 Miller {{decided to}} leave acting for photography. He taught himself the {{difficult}} <b>carbro</b> printing <b>process</b> (which involves lengthy layering of cyan, yellow and magenta pigments individually) and purchased a one-shot color camera which took three images simultaneously, allowing him to render portraits and moving subjects. Before long he had converted a bathroom in his parents' house into a makeshift darkroom so he could begin processing his freelance work, making him the only one at the time working in, and developing, carbro prints.|$|R
5000|$|Moffat {{continued}} {{to live and work}} at Fitzroy Square. He and Iris Tree had been divorced in 1932. He returned to portrait photography and also undertook commercial colour photography. He began experimenting with the complex and delicate <b>carbro</b> three colour <b>process.</b> A one-man show of his colour photographs, [...] "Still Lifes and Compositions with Light", was held at the Mayor Gallery in 1925. His work was included in the Museum of Modern Art exhibition [...] "Photography 1839-1937". On 16 April 1936 in London, he married Kathleen Allan, who had worked with him for some years in his studio. The couple had a daughter, Penelope, in 1938.|$|R
