40|$|We have {{developed}} an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems suitable for permanent seismic stations, and have used it to replace commercial UPS systems at seismic stations belonging to the Daidaitoku seismic network. For use in seismic stations, the newly developed UPS system offers several advantages over the commercial UPS systems that are often used to protect personal computers from a sudden power failure. First, independent cut-off voltages can be set for two different output circuits, one for an ISDN router {{and the other for}} a seismometer and data logger. In addition, DC power can be supplied using a battery, and the efficiency is improved by about two times. Finally, the new UPS is more compact, which allows easier handling at stations. 　　When a battery with a capacity of 40 Ah is used, the newly developed UPS is designed to supply continuous electric power to equipment for seven days after a commercial power failure. To achieve this, the power to the ISDN router, which represents approximately 70 % of the total power, is automatically turned off about two days after the power failure occurs. The power supply to the data logger and seismometer is maintained until the battery voltage reaches a preset lower limit, in order to prevent deep discharge. If the <b>commercial</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is restored at the station, all systems are restarted and the battery is automatically recharged. 　　After being installed in the Daidaitoku seismic network, the new UPS systems functioned without any problems. Therefore, the power system in seismic stations can be successfully upgraded in this manner. ＜論説...|$|E

30|$|Recent {{technological}} advances in cosmic-ray muon radiography (Nagamine et al., 1996) has enabled scientists to better determine the internal {{structure of a}} volcano. Cosmic-ray muons, which are characterized by small horizontal angles at sea level, are high-energy particles that can penetrate through a volcano. The amount of energy lost by muons while passing through matter {{is dependent on the}} density of that matter. The resultant angular distribution of the muons can then be used to calculate the density profile of a volcano and, consequently, its internal structure. Therefore, a cosmic-ray muon radiography detection system is needed to determine the paths of these muons and to count the events. Various volcanoes have recently been observed by a detection system using a nuclear emulsion film (Tanaka et al., 2007 a, b, c). In terms of space limitations associated with these systems near volcanoes, however, a compact system would be useful. However, we are not able to use this system for real-time observations, and real-time readings may facilitate the predictions of volcanic eruptions. A system for real-time observation requires readout electronics. A number of systems already exist for this purpose (Tanaka et al., 2001, 2003, 2005), but since these systems are designed based on NIM (U.S. NIM Committee, 1990) and CAMAC (IEEE, 1982) system, power consumption is large and the systems require <b>commercial</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies.</b> It is, therefore, difficult to construct such systems near volcanoes.

40|$|With high {{performance}} mobile computing devices like tablets and smart-phones virtually swiping the VLSI chip market, {{the industry is}} facing the perpetual challenge of optimizing between power and performance, more than ever before. Although, existing Power Distribution Network (PDN) designs take into consideration issues like IR drop and crosstalk noise, they practically ignore the actual power loss in the network. In this work we try to bridge that gap, and propose a scheme for delivering power to different parts of a large integrated circuit, such as modules on a System on Chip (SoC), at a higher than the regular voltage.

40|$|The {{electrical}} efficiency of telecommunication <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> is increasing to meet customer demands for lower {{total cost of}} ownership. Increased capital cost can now be justified if it enables sufficiently large energy savings, allowing the use of topologies and devices previously considered unnecessarily complex or expensive. Silicon carbide Schottky diodes have already been incorporated into <b>commercial</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> as expensive, but energy saving components. This thesis pursues the next step of considering silicon carbide transistors for use in telecommunications power converters. A range of silicon carbide transistors was considered with a primary focus on recently developed, normally-off, junction field effect transistors. Tests were devised and performed to uncover a number of previously unpublished characteristics of normally-off silicon carbide JFETs. Specifically, unique reverse conduction and associated gate current draw relationships were measured {{as well as the}} ability to block small reverse voltages when a negative gate-source voltage is applied. Reverse recovery-like characteristics were also measured and found to be superior to those of silicon MOSFETs. These characteristics significantly impact the steps that are required to maximize efficiency with normally-off SiC JFETs in circuits where synchronous rectification or bidirectional blocking is performed. A gate drive circuit was proposed that combines a number of recommendations to achieve rapid and efficient switching of normally-off SiC JFETs. Specifically, a low transient output impedance was provided to achieve rapid turn-on and turn-off transitions as well as a high dc output impedance to limit the steady state drive current while sustaining the turned-on state. A prototype circuit was constructed using building blocks that are typically found in single chip MOSFET drivers. The circuit was shown to operate well from a single supply, alleviating the need for a split supply such as that required by many published JFET drive circuits. This demonstrated a proof of concept for a single chip JFET driver solution. An active power factor correction circuit topology was extensively modelled and a prototype designed and tested to verify the model. The circuit was able to operate at switching frequencies in excess of 100 kHz when using SiC JFETs, whereas silicon MOSFETs could only achieve switching frequencies of several kHz before switching losses became excessive. The circuit was designed as the dc equivalent for a 2 kW, 230 V AC input power converter with a split +/- 400 V dc output. A commercial single phase telecommunications power converter was modified to utilise normally-off SiC JFETs in its power factor correction circuit. The converter was tested and found to achieve similar {{electrical efficiency}} with 1200 V SiC JFETs to that achieved with 600 V silicon MOSFETs. The performance of the 1200 V SiC JFETs in this application was also compared to that of 900 V silicon MOSFETs and found to be superior. Finally, a prototype three-phase cyclo-converter was modified to use 1200 V normallyoff SiC JFETs in place of 600 V silicon MOSFETs and found to achieve similar electrical efficiency to the silicon MOSFETs in a 208 V three phase system. These results strongly indicate that the 1200 V SiC JFETs would provide better performance than 900 V silicon MOSFETs in a 400 V three phase system (that had been considered for commercial development) ...|$|R

Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Some possible performance improvements on the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> are also suggested. The designed <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> can satisfy the requirements for commercial applications such as plasma generation and air purification system...|$|R
