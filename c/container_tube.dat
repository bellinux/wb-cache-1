40|$|High quality, ex-situ powder-in-tube (PIT) MgB 2 superconductors are {{fabricated}} {{using the}} explosive compaction technique. During the treatment, the precursor materials are densified under high strain-rates using PETN as the explosive medium. It {{has been found}} that the product quality depends on the porosity of the compact, which affects the critical current density of the superconductor by introducing changes in the interparticle bonding of the material, as well as the peak shockwave pressure which has an effect on the maximum tensile stress imposed to the specimen. This determines the crack formation in the consolidated powder and the uniformity of the product's final shape. The explosive compaction process has been modeled using the LS-DYNA explicit finite element code where the compacted MgB 2 powder is treated as a porous soil-like material with a customised yield surface. The results of the numerical simulation include the compact porosity, the pressure, the temperature and strain rate profiles as well as the dimensions of the final product, which are used as input data in order to assess the efficiency of the explosive compaction process. The process is non-parametrically optimised for the above mentioned quality factors, and the optimal dimensions of the explosive charge and <b>container</b> <b>tube</b> are determined...|$|E

The literature relating to the contamination of ophthalmic ointments has been reviewed. The survival of microorganisms deliberately incorporated into various eye ointments has been studied, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for organisms in pure and mixed culture. The use of isopropyl myristate (IPM) as a dilutent for nonaqueous products during the isolation (membrane filtration) of contaminating organisms has been examined. Both sterile filtered and autoclaved IPM were used. Plastic and aluminium <b>containers</b> (<b>tubes)</b> were compared on an in-use, swept volume basis as part of contamination control, IPM did not interfere with organism recovery and results suggest that bacteria may survive for several days in such ointments.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of irrigation intensity in development of Cedrella fissilis seedlings in the greenhouse. The statistical design was randomized blocks, arranged in a bi-factorial design with split plot with three replications. As main plot was characterized for irrigation frequencies (treatments) : T 1 – one time irrigation daily (at 11 h 00 min); T 2 – two times irrigation daily (at 11 h 00 min and 19 h 00 min); T 3 – three times irrigation daily (at 07 h 00 min, 11 h 00 min, and 19 h 00 min) and T 4 – four times irrigation daily (at 07 h 00 min, 11 h 00 min, 15 h 00 min, and 19 h 00 min) and as a sub-portion eight times week assessment, and an eighth hardening phase. For the experiment was used a system of localized irrigation, consisting of: pump, irrigation nozzles, tubes and valves. The seedlings were grown in plastic <b>containers</b> (<b>tubes)</b> suspended for PVC trays.

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the influence of substrate composition and volume of <b>container</b> (<b>tubes)</b> in the growth of seedlings of canjerana (Cabralea canjerana), in the nursery and field. In nursery, three compositions of peat substrates were evaluated (100 % peat, peat + 20 % rice hulls (RH) and peat + 40 % RH) and combined with two sizes of containers (100 and 280 cm 3). Measurements of root collar diameter (DC) and height (H) were performed monthly during 330 days, and the ratio H/DC was also calculated. At 330 days, the root, air and total dry masses and Dickson’s quality index were assessed. The same treatments were evaluated in the field during a period of 360 days and DC and H were measured and H/DC was calculated in every 90 -day period. In the nursery and field experiments were carried out with experimental design of random blocks, with four replications. Seedlings of canjerana can be produced in a substrate composed of 60 % peat and 40 % of rice hulls without harming its growth in the field, with a view that the economy is in nursery. The tube of the tube in the size 280 cm 3 only provided superior growth of seedlings during the field phase, where seedlings produced in these containers expressed a better performance in relation to root collar diameter and root dry mass...|$|R

40|$|Highly {{sensitive}} {{measurement of}} DNA concentration on portable, easy-to-use, low-cost miniaturized equipments without sample waste is challenging. The DNA peak optical absorbance at lambda = 260 nm is a wellknown property already {{used in the}} spectrometric measurement of DNA concentration. Existing apparatus are large-sized, expensive and require a manipulation of DNA. In the current work, a low-power, suitable and miniaturized photosensor aiming at a sensitive and direct measurement of DNA concentration has been designed. Direct measurement, i. e. without sample manipulation, implies UV transmission through the translucid tube wall from the closed tube containing the DNA sample in solution. To allow measurements at such low wavelengths, we designed and fabricated photodiodes in SOI technology to ensure a high responsivity in the UV range. Measurements of the photodevice confirmed its responsivity spectrum and magnitudes. These fully integrable photodiodes, fabricated in SOI CMOS technology, can be coupled to a complete signal processing microsystem. Direct measurements at 280 nm optical wavelength of serially diluted DNA within a closed tube (range: 40 pg/ mu L to 400 ng/ mu L in a volume of 45 mu L) generated a monotonic relation between the DNA concentration and {{the mean of the}} diode photocurrent induced by light transmission through DNA solution and <b>tube</b> <b>container.</b> Absorbance of the incident UV ray was inversely proportional to DNA concentration. The photosensor compared favorably with other DNA quantitative methods (spectrophotometry, fluorometry, real-time PCR) in terms of sensitivity.
