5|$|As {{the lead}} ship of the Majestic-class of light {{aircraft}} <b>carriers,</b> Melbourne was {{conceived as a}} modified version of the Colossus-class carrier, incorporating improvements in flight deck design and habitability. Majestic- and Colossus-class <b>carriers</b> were almost identical in hull design and both were considered subclasses of the '1942 design' light aircraft carrier program. These <b>carriers</b> were intended as 'disposable warships': to be disposed of at the end of World War II or within three years of entering service.|$|E
5|$|At 09:35, a Catalina {{made the}} first {{sighting}} of the Ryūjō force. Later that morning, several more sightings of Ryūjō and ships of Kondo's and Mikawa's forces by carrier and other U.S. reconnaissance aircraft followed. Throughout the morning and early afternoon, U.S. aircraft also sighted several Japanese scout aircraft and submarines, leading Fletcher {{to believe that the}} Japanese knew where his <b>carriers</b> were, which actually was not yet the case. Still, Fletcher hesitated to order a strike against the Ryūjō group until he was sure there were no other Japanese <b>carriers</b> in the area. Finally, with no firm word on the presence or location of other Japanese <b>carriers,</b> at 13:40 Fletcher launched a strike of 38 aircraft from Saratoga to attack Ryūjō. However, he kept aircraft in reserve from both U.S. <b>carriers</b> potentially ready should any Japanese fleet <b>carriers</b> be sighted.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, two new {{aircraft}} <b>carriers</b> were planned. The {{requirements for the}} intended force of four <b>carriers</b> meant that five squadrons of Phantoms would be needed. However, in its 1966 Defence White Paper, the Government decided to cancel the two new <b>carriers,</b> which led to reductions in the total order for the Royal Navy's Phantoms. Initially 143 were ordered, which was cut to 110, and finally just 50, with options for another seven. The intention was to form a pair of front-line squadrons, each of twelve aircraft, that would operate from the two remaining, heavily modernised fleet <b>carriers.</b> The rest of the aircraft would be a reserve and for training.|$|E

5|$|In 1943 the Royal Navy {{commissioned}} six {{light aircraft}} <b>carriers</b> {{in an effort}} to counter the German and Japanese navies. The 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier, commonly referred to as the British Light Fleet Carrier, was the result.

5|$|The Lexington-class {{aircraft}} <b>carriers</b> were a pair {{of aircraft}} <b>carriers</b> built for the United States Navy (USN) during the 1920s. The ships were built on hulls originally laid down as battlecruisers after World War I, but under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, all U.S. battleship and battlecruiser construction was cancelled. The Treaty, however, allowed two of the unfinished ships to be converted to <b>carriers.</b> They were the first operational aircraft <b>carriers</b> in the USN and were used to develop carrier aviation tactics and procedures before World War II {{in a series of}} annual exercises.|$|E
5|$|The Nimitz-class {{aircraft}} <b>carriers</b> {{were ordered}} to supplement the aircraft <b>carriers</b> of the Kitty Hawk class and Enterprise class, maintaining the strength and capability of the U.S. Navy after the older <b>carriers</b> were decommissioned. The ships were designed to be improvements on previous U.S. aircraft <b>carriers,</b> in particular the Enterprise and Forrestal-class supercarriers, although {{the arrangement of the}} ships is relatively {{similar to that of the}} Kitty Hawk class. Among other design improvements, the two reactors on Nimitz-class <b>carriers</b> take up less space than the eight reactors used on Enterprise. Along with a more generally improved design, this means that Nimitz-class <b>carriers</b> can carry 90% more aviation fuel and 50% more ordnance when compared to the Forrestal class.|$|E
5|$|This {{invasion}} {{brought on}} the last great sortie of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Its plan for the Battle of Leyte Gulf included a feint by a northern force of planeless heavy attack <b>carriers</b> to draw away the battleships, cruisers and fast <b>carriers</b> with which Admiral Halsey was protecting the landings. This was to allow the Japanese Center Force to enter the gulf through San Bernardino Strait. At {{the opening of the}} battle planes from the <b>carriers</b> guarded by New Jersey struck hard at both the Japanese Southern and Center Forces, sinking a battleship 23 October. The next day Halsey shaped his course north after the decoy force had been spotted. Planes from his <b>carriers</b> sank four of the Japanese <b>carriers,</b> as well as a destroyer and a cruiser, while New Jersey steamed south at flank speed to meet the newly developed threat of the Center force. It had been turned back in a stunning defeat when she arrived.|$|E

5|$|Trucking {{companies}} (motor <b>carriers)</b> {{can also}} play a role in HOS violations. Certain <b>carriers</b> may choose to knowingly ignore HOS violations made by their drivers, or even encourage their drivers to do so. Allowing drivers to violate the HOS is an effective cost-cutting measure used mostly by non-union, long haul <b>carriers.</b> Permitting HOS violations allows a carrier to hire fewer drivers, and run on fewer trucks than a company which follows the rules. To comply with the HOS, these companies would have to hire more drivers (possibly driving up wages) and purchase additional trucks and trailers. Making a change to comply with the law is complicated by competition with <b>carriers</b> that already comply with HOS regulations. Due to this competition, <b>carriers</b> who choose to switch from non-compliance could not pass on all of their increased costs associated with HOS compliance to their customers.|$|E
5|$|A post-war {{review by}} the Australian government's Defence Committee {{recommended}} that the RAN be restructured around a task force incorporating multiple aircraft <b>carriers.</b> Initial plans were for three <b>carriers,</b> with two active and a third in reserve at any given time, although funding cuts led to the purchase of only two <b>carriers</b> in June 1947; Terrible and sister ship Majestic, for the combined cost of AU£2.75 million, plus stores, fuel, and ammunition. As Terrible was fitted out as a flagship and was the closer of the two ships to completion, construction was finished without major modification. Although Terrible was due for completion on 24 June 1948, a skilled labour shortage affected {{the installation of the}} ship's boilers, causing the Admiralty to revise the delivery date to October 1948.|$|E

5|$|As a result, the Americans {{entered the}} battle with a very good picture of where, when, and in what {{strength}} the Japanese would appear. Nimitz knew that the Japanese had negated their numerical advantage by dividing their ships into four separate task groups, all too-widely separated {{to be able to}} support each other. This dispersal resulted in few fast ships being available to escort the Carrier Striking Force, reducing the number of anti-aircraft guns protecting the <b>carriers.</b> Nimitz calculated that the aircraft on his three <b>carriers,</b> plus those on Midway Island, gave the U.S. rough parity with Yamamoto's four <b>carriers,</b> mainly because American carrier air groups were larger than Japanese ones. The Japanese, by contrast, remained mainly unaware of their opponent's true strength and dispositions even after the battle began.|$|E

5|$|As of January 1945, the Third Fleet {{was built}} around the Fast Carrier Task Force, which was the main US Navy strike force in the Pacific. Control of this force alternated at regular {{intervals}} between the Third and Fifth Fleets (commanded by Halsey and Admiral Raymond A.

The fast carrier groups were Task Group 38.1 with four aircraft <b>carriers,</b> two battleships, six cruisers and 25 destroyers, Task Group 38.2 with four <b>carriers,</b> three battleships, five cruisers and 24 destroyers and Task Group 38.3 which comprised four <b>carriers,</b> three battleships, five cruisers and 17 destroyers. The night carrier group, Task Group 38.5, had two <b>carriers</b> and six destroyers, and operated with Task Group 38.2 during the day. These carrier groups embarked around 900 aircraft in total. The other major element of the fleet was a logistics element designated Task Group 30.8 which comprised a varying number of tankers and ammunition ships, several escort <b>carriers</b> which transported replacement aircraft for Task Force 38 {{and a large number}} of escorting destroyers.
