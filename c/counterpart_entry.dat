40|$|Balance of {{payments}} accounts {{are constructed using}} a double-entry accounting principle such that total credits equal total debits. Modelling each entry independently will not guarantee this equality. It is therefore important to identify the <b>counterpart</b> <b>entries</b> or 'accommodating' items that ensure that total credits equal total debits. This short paper identifies the accommodating item for the UK by presenting institutional evidence on the means of payment for international transactions. The paper contributes to the debate about whether the net overseas assets of banks {{are determined by the}} non-bank private sector or by the banks themselves. It also sheds light on statistical attempts to measure the volatility of various investment flows. The conclusions of the paper are likely to apply to any developed country with a well-developed banking system. Balance {{of payments}}, autonomous, accommodating, bank deposits, volatility...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{individuals}} {{have been identified}} who possess T cell responses to herpes simplex virus (HSV) antigens {{despite the absence of}} detectable anti-HSV antibodies in their serum. The significance of this immune seronegative status is unclear, but it could indicate resistance to overt HSV infection. The aims of the present study were to investigate whether genetic differences in receptors used by HSV for cell entry (herpesvirus entry mediator [HVEM], nectin- 1, and nectin- 2) could be detected in immune seronegative individuals. Coding polymorphisms were identified in the HVEM and nectin- 1 genes. The variant receptor proteins were expressed, and their ability to bind the viral ligand glycoprotein D and to mediate HSV entry after transient transfection into normally resistant cells was compared with that of their wild-type <b>counterparts.</b> HSV <b>entry</b> activity in wild-type and variant forms of the receptors was indistinguishable, which indicates that the polymorphisms observed are unlikely to explain the possible restrictions on HSV replication or spread in immune seronegative individuals. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies second-price auctions {{in which}} bidders make {{participation}} decisions sequentially in an exogenous order and participating bidders incur bidding costs. When bidders {{decide whether to}} participate or not, they know their own valuations as well as earlier bidders’ participation decisions. To analyze bidders’ participation and bidding decisions, we study equilibria in cutoff strategies with which a bidder participates and bids his valuation if his valuation exceeds a cutoff given his observation on earlier bidders’ participation. Focusing {{on the case of}} two bidders, we present two main results on comparative statics and revenue comparison. In the comparative statics analysis, we study the effects of a change in bidders’ characteristics on equilibrium cutoffs. In revenue comparison, we show that the considered sequential entry format yields lower revenue than the simultaneous <b>entry</b> <b>counterpart.</b> Finally, we discuss the difficulties in generalizing these two results for the case of more than two bidders...|$|R
40|$|The age {{at which}} women enter first {{marriage}} {{is known to be}} a major factor in marital instability. But to date possible differences by race/ ethnicity have not been examined. We use data from the 2006 - 2010 National Survey of Family Growth to examine differences by race/ethnicity {{in the shape of the}} curve relating women's age at entry into first marriage to marital instability. We find that for non-Hispanic white women, the probability of dissolution falls with age up to ages 30 - 32 and thereafter the curve flattens out. For black women, marital instability decreases with age only up to ages 24 - 26. For Hispanic women, marital instability falls from age 2 ̆ 26420 to 21 - 23 and then the curve flattens out; beyond ages 30 - 32 the curve turns upward. We suggest explanations for these patterns based in part on differentials in the associations of age at marriage with education and non-marital fertility. For white women, but not for their black and Hispanic <b>counterparts,</b> delayed <b>entry</b> into marriage is associated with a small increase in non-marital fertility and a pronounced increase in education. The common practice in the demographic literature in the U. S. of conducting pooled analyses with simple controls for black, Hispanic, and other can lead to misleading conclusions. Our findings underscore the desirability of conducting separate analyses by race / ethnicity wherever possible...|$|R
40|$|Background : Numerous {{studies have}} shown that the age at which women enter first {{marriage}} is a major factor in marital instability, but possible differences by race/ethnicity have not been examined to date. Objective : Our aim was to study whether the association between women's age at first marriage and marital instability varies by race/ethnicity. Methods : We used data from the 2006 - 2010 National Survey of Family Growth to examine differences by race/ethnicity in the shape of the curve relating women's age at entry into first marriage to marital instability. Results : We found that for non-Hispanic white women, the probability of dissolution falls with age up to ages 30 - 32 and thereafter the curve flattens out. For black women, marital instability decreases with age only up to ages 24 - 26. For Hispanic women, marital instability falls from age ≤ 20 to 21 - 23 and then the curve flattens out; beyond ages 30 - 32 the curve turns upward. Conclusions : We suggest explanations for these patterns, based in part on differentials in the associations of age at marriage with education and nonmarital fertility. For white women, but not for their black and Hispanic <b>counterparts,</b> delayed <b>entry</b> into marriage is associated with a small increase in nonmarital fertility and a pronounced increase in education. Contribution : The common practice in studies with US data of conducting pooled analyses - with simple controls for black, Hispanic, and other - can lead to misleading conclusions.

40|$|Recognising {{the unique}} {{demographic}} {{attributes of the}} Central Queensland region and the low participation rates in tertiary education of its citizens, CQUniversity (CQU) in 1986 introduced the Skills for Tertiary Education Preparatory Studies (STEPS) program, which is designed for adult learners returning to study, often after many years’ absence. Within CQU, the definition of ‘quality’ is ‘fitness for purpose’ and STEPS aims to deliver a quality program that gives adult learners the skills for success in tertiary studies. These skills, which balance the academic and the personal, assist students to shed unproductive worldviews that may have hindered past study. This chapter seeks to answer the research question: Do ex-STEPS students perceive that participating in the STEPS program increased their chances of success in undergraduate study, and did they have an advantage over their direct <b>entry</b> <b>counterparts?</b> Three themes are explored: academic skills, transformational learning and lecturers’ teaching. The research reveals that students believed that the STEPS program is a quality program, and that both the development of academic and personal skills and the transformation of restrictive worldviews had increased students’ probability of success in undergraduate study...|$|R
40|$|Adolescents {{in rural}} areas {{encounter}} many unique situations that can significantly influence career development and decision-making. For example, individuals living {{in rural areas}} {{tend to be more}} eco-nomically, educationally, and vocationally disadvantaged than their urban counterparts (Lam, Chan, Parker, & Carter, 1987). People in rural areas must also contend with geographic isolation, fewer em-ployment opportunities, lack of economic vitality, few role models, and lower educational and vocational achievement (Helge, 1984; Reid, 1989; Rojewski, 1993). As a result of this grim reality, the prevalence of young people who are at-risk of academic and/or social failure is high in rural areas (Helge, 1991). Given the environment that many rural youth experience, this population would appear to be vulnerable to lowered occupational aspirations and expectations. Recent investigations have presented somewhat conflicting results concerning the occupational aspirations of rural adolescents when compared to nonrural adolescents. Cobb, Mclntire, and Pratt (1989) found the vocational aspirations of rural youth to generally be lower than nonrural peers. These researchers also reported that rural youth were more likely than their urban <b>counterparts</b> to anticipate <b>entry</b> into the workplace immediately upon graduation from high school. In contrast, other investigations have found that rural adolescents share occupational aspirations that are similar to that of their non-rural counterparts. Interestingly, young rural women appear to main...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 2 This chapter {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which gender differences in risk aversion explain why women have a lower entrepreneurship rate, earn less, and work fewer hours than men. Data from the NLSY 79 confirms previous findings that women are more risk averse than men. However, while less risk averse men tend to become self-employed, there is no significant effect of risk aversion on women 2 ̆ 7 s entrepreneurship decisions. Similarly, greater risk aversion increases earnings for male entrepreneurs, but it has no effect on female entrepreneurial earnings. More risk aversion lowers female wages, but the effects are of modest magnitude. On the contrary, more risk aversion raises male wages. Risk aversion does not explain variation in hours of work for either men or women. These findings and standard decomposition suggest that widely reported differences in risk aversion across genders play only a trivial role in explaining gender gaps in labor market outcomes. Chapter 3 While more risk averse individuals are less likely to become entrepreneurs, theory predicts that more risk averse entrepreneurs pick ventures with higher expected returns and so they should survive in business longer than their less risk averse <b>counterparts.</b> Using successive <b>entry</b> cohorts of young entrepreneurs in the NLSY 79, we find contrary to theory that the most successful entrepreneurs are the least risk averse. This surprising finding suggests that commonly used measures of risk aversion are not indicators of taste toward risk. Instead, measured risk aversion signals weak entrepreneurial ability [...] the least risk averse are apparently those who can best assess and manage risks. Indeed, our interpretation is consistent with recent experimental evidence linking cognitive ability with a greater willingness to accept risk. Chapter 4 The fourth chapter investigates the stability of measured risk attitudes over time, using a 13 -year longitudinal sample of individuals in the NLSY 79. A variance decomposition shows that 57...|$|R
