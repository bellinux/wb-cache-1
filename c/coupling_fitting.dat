40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{and analyze the}} learning scenario of coupled nonlinear dimensionality reduction, which combines two major steps of machine learning pipeline: projection onto a manifold and subsequent supervised learning. First, we present new generalization bounds for this scenario and, second, we introduce an algorithm that follows from these bounds. The generalization error bound {{is based on a}} careful analysis of the empirical Rademacher complexity of the relevant hypothesis set. In particular, we show an upper bound on the Rademacher complexity that is in O(√(Λ_(r) /m)), where m is the sample size and Λ_(r) the upper bound on the Ky-Fan r-norm of the associated kernel matrix. We give both upper and lower bound guarantees in terms of that Ky-Fan r-norm, which strongly justifies the definition of our hypothesis set. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first learning guarantees for the problem of coupled dimensionality reduction. Our analysis and learning guarantees further apply to several special cases, such as that of using a fixed kernel with supervised dimensionality reduction or that of unsupervised learning of a kernel for dimensionality reduction followed by a supervised learning algorithm.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of benzodiazepine receptors {{in the human}} brain has been widely studied with SPECT using 123 I-iomazenil and semiquantitative approaches, but these methods do not allow quantification of the total receptor site concentration available for binding (B 9 max) and of the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd/VR). One of the major obstacles to full quantitative studies is that pharmacologic effects preclude the administration to humans of the high doses of iomazenil required to displace the labeled ligand from the receptors. In this study, we applied a dual-ligand protocol using the unlabeled ligand flumazenil, which lacks pharmacologic effects, to quantify all binding parameters of the benzodiazepine receptor– 123 I-iomazenil interactions. Methods: 123 I-Iomazenil SPECT and MRI were acquired in 8 healthyvolunteers, oneofwhomhadparticipated in a 11 C-flumazenil PET experiment. The experimental protocol consisted of injec-tions of 123 I-iomazenil and/or unlabeled flumazenil. We developed akineticmodel to integrate thedifferent pharmacokineticsof these 2 ligands. To simplify the model, we assumed linear relationships between iomazenil and flumazenil parameters and adjusted them using a <b>coupled</b> <b>fitting</b> procedure. The resulting con-strained 5 -parametermodel was thenused toquantify the biologic parameters. Results: Across regions, we obtained B 9 max values ranging from 7 to 69 pmol/mL and KdVR values for IMZ from 2. 3 to 3. 7 pmol/mL. There was a close correlation in the B 9 max values calculated in the same volunteer using 123 I-iomazenil SPECT and 11 C-flumazenil PET.

40|$|For last decades, {{magnetohydrodynamic}} (MHD) waves arise to a {{hot topic}} of solar physics. With modern instruments, MHD wave modes are reliably detected, not only for their potential to heat the solar corona, {{but also as a}} new tool to diagnose the plasma parameters remotely (MHD seismology). In this thesis, we use space-borne EUV/UV imagers and ground-based observatories to study compressive MHD waves in coronal loops and sunspots. We identify several instrumental artifacts and formulate the scheme to estimate the imager data noise. The diagnostic potential of MHD waves in various plasma structures are also investigated. The orbit-related long periodicities (30 - 96 min) in the TRACE images and the derotation-induced short periodicy (3 - 9 min) in the SDO/AIA images are studied and quantified. The methods are proposed to mitigate the effects of such artificial periodicities. The noise level of AIA images is formulated. In sunspots, the 5 –min oscillation power usually forms a ring structure enclosing the sunspot umbra. The phase variation was found to display high-order MHD azimuthal body modes. The mode numbers were measured and justified by significance tests. A multi-level observation of magnetoacoustic waves in sunspot was performed. The variation of the magnetoacoustic cut-off frequency over sunspot cross-sectional geometry and sunspot atmosphere was quantified and exploited to diagnose the inclination angle of the magnetic field. To automatically measure the propagating speed of compressive MHD waves, we designed cross-fitting technique (CFT), 2 D <b>coupled</b> <b>fitting</b> (DCF) and best similarity measure (BSM). Parametric studies were performed to confirm the validity and robustness of these methods. Distinct propagating fast wave trains were found to be associated with radio bursts that were generated by the flare-accelerated non-thermal electrons. The stretching wavelength along the waveguide implies that the wave trains were impulsively triggered. The wave parameters are measured to probe the properties of guided fast waves.

40|$|Context. Propagating {{disturbances}} of the EUV emission intensity {{are commonly}} observed over {{a variety of}} coronal structures. Parameters of these disturbances, particularly the observed apparent (image-plane projected) propagation speed, are important tools for MHD coronal seismology. Aims. We design and test tools to reliably measure the apparent phase speed of propagating disturbances in imaging data sets. Methods. We designed cross-fitting technique (CFT), 2 D <b>coupled</b> <b>fitting</b> (DCF) and best similarity match (BSM) to measure the apparent phase speed of propagating EUV disturbances in the running differences of time-distance plots (R) and background-removed and normalised time-distance plots (D). Results. The methods were applied {{to the analysis of}} quasi-periodic EUV disturbances propagating at a coronal fan-structure of active region NOAA 11330 on 27 Oct. 2011, observed with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on SDO in the 171 Å bandpass. The noise propagation in the AIA image processing was estimated, resulting in the preliminary estimation of the uncertainties in the AIA image flux. This information was used in measuring the apparent phase speed of the propagating disturbances with the CFT, DCF and BSM methods, which gave consistent results. The average projected speed is measured at 47. 6 [*]±[*] 0. 6 [*]km[*]s- 1 and 49. 0 [*]±[*] 0. 7 [*]km[*]s- 1 for R and D, with the corresponding periods at 179. 7 [*]±[*] 0. 2 [*]s and 179. 7 [*]±[*] 0. 3 [*]s, respectively. We analysed the effects of the lag time and the detrending time in the running difference processing and the background-removed plot, on the measurement of the speed, and found that they are fairly weak. Conclusions. The CFT, DCF and BSM methods are found to be reliable techniques for measuring the apparent (projected) phase speed. The samples of larger effective spatial length are more suitable for these methods. Time-distance plots with background removal and normalisation allow for more robust measurements, with little effect of the choice of the detrending time. Cross-fitting technique provides reliable measurements on good samples (e. g. samples with large effective detection length and recurring features). 2 D coupled-fitting is found {{to be sensitive to the}} initial guess for parameters of the 2 D fitting function.

Both mechanisms generate self-sustained oscillations, the oscillations interact, TGF modulates {{the frequency and}} amplitude of the myogenic oscillation, and the oscillations synchronize; a 5 : 1 frequency ratio is the most frequent. TGF oscillations synchronize in nephron pairs supplied from a common cortical radial artery, as do myogenic oscillations. We propose that electrotonic vascular signal propagation from one juxtaglomerular apparatus interacts with similar signals from other nephrons to produce synchronization. We tested this idea in tubular-vascular preparations from mice. Vascular smooth muscle cells were loaded with a fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye; fluorescence intensity was measured with confocal microscopy. Perfusion of the thick ascending limb activated TGF and depolarized afferent arteriolar smooth muscle cells. The depolarization spread to the cortical radial artery and other afferent arterioles and declined with distance from the perfused juxtaglomerular apparatus, consistent with electrotonic vascular signal propagation.

40|$|In this work, {{we study}} the {{radiative}} decay of heavy quarkonium states {{by using the}} effective Lagrangian approach. Firstly, we construct the spin-breaking terms in the effective Lagrangian for the nP mS transitions and determine the some of the <b>coupling</b> constants by <b>fitting</b> the experimental data. Our results show that in χ_cJ, ψ(2 S), Υ(2 S), and Υ(3 S) radiative decays, the spin-breaking effect is so small that can be ignored. Secondly, we investigate the radiative decay widths of the cc̅(1 D) states and find the if ψ(3770) is a pure ^ 3 D_ 1 state its radiative decay into χ_cJ+γ roughly preserve the heavy-quark spin symmetry, while {{if it is a}} S-D mixing state with mixing angel 12 ^∘ the heavy quark-spin symmetry in its radiative decay and in the radiative decay of ψ(3686) will be largely violated. In the end, we show that combining the radiative decay and the light hadron decay of P-wave χ_bJ(1, 2 P) can provide another way to extract the information of the color-octet matrix element in the context of non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) effective theory, and our result is consistent with potential NRQCD hypothesis.

40|$|We {{have tested}} the {{theoretical}} values of critical exponents, predicted {{for the three}} [...] dimensional Heisenberg model, based on the published Monte Carlo (MC) simulation data for the susceptibility. Two different sets of the critical exponents have been considered - one provided by the usual (perturbative) renormalization group (RG) theory, and another predicted by grouping of Feynman diagrams in phi^ 4 model (our theory). The test consists of two steps. First we determine the critical <b>coupling</b> by <b>fitting</b> the MC data to the theoretical expression, including both confluent and analytical corrections to scaling, the values of critical exponents being taken from theory. Then we use the obtained value of critical coupling to test the agreement between theory and MC data at criticality. As a result, {{we have found that}} predictions of our theory (gamma= 19 / 14, eta= 1 / 10, omega= 3 / 5) are consistent, whereas those of the perturbative RG theory (gamma= 1. 3895, eta= 0. 0355, omega= 0. 782) are inconsistent with the MC data. The seemable agreement between the RG prediction for eta and MC results at criticality, reported in literature, appears due to slightly overestimated value of the critical coupling. Estimation of critical exponents of 3 D Ising model from complex zeroth of the partition function is discussed. A refined analysis yields the best estimate 1 /nu= 1. 518. We conclude that the recent MC data can be completely explained within our theory (providing 1 /nu= 1. 5 and omega= 0. 5) rather than within the conventional RG theory. Comment: 16 pages, 7 figures. Currently, the paper has been completed by a refined estimation of the critical exponent nu from the imaginary part of the partition function zeroth in 3 D Ising model: nonlinear fits yield the best estimate 1 /nu= 1. 518 in agreement with our theoretical value 1. 5. This is explained in two additional figure...|$|R
