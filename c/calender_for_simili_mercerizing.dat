40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{have been}} undertaken {{for the process}} of calendering viscoplastic sheets with a finite thickness. The finite element method (FEM) is used to provide numerical results for a fixed entry thickness (known attachment point) under two-dimensional steady-state conditions. The Herschel-Bulkley-Papanastasiou model of viscoplasticity is used, which is valid for all ranges of deformation rates. Part of the solution is finding {{the shape of the}} free surfaces of the entering and exiting sheet. Yielded/unyielded regions are found a posteriori for a range of the dimensionless yield stress or Bingham number (Bn) from the Newtonian viscous fluid (Bn = 0) to a highly viscoplastic one (Bn = 1000). The 2 D FEM results show limited unyielded regions between the rolls, in disagreement with the lubrication approximation theory (LAT). which predicts erroneous extended unyielded regions. However, LAT is good at predicting the excess sheet thickness over the thickness at the nip (hence the detachment point), the pressure distribution and all engineering quantities of interest in <b>calendering.</b> <b>For</b> thick entering sheets, viscoplasticity (and also shear-thinning) leads to excess sheet thickness as the dimensionless Bingham number increases; it reduces the vortex size in the fluid bank, and gives virtually no swelling at the exit from the rolls.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} effect of hot {{calendering}} on bacterial cellulose (BC) films properties, aiming the achievement of good transparency and barrier property. A comparison was made using vegetal cellulose (VC) films on a similar basis weight of around 40 g. m- 2. The optical-structural, mechanical and barrier property of BC films were studied and {{compared with those of}} highly beaten VC films. The Youngs moduli and tensile index of the BC films are much higher than those obtained for VC (14. 5 16. 2 GPa vs 10. 8 8. 7 GPa and 146. 7 64. 8 N. m. g- 1 vs 82. 8 40. 5 N. m. g- 1), respectively. Calendering increased significantly the transparency of BC films from 53. 0 % to 73. 0 %. The effect of BC ozonation was also studied. Oxidation with ozone somewhat enhanced the brightness and transparency of the BC films, but at the expenses of slightly lower mechanical properties. BC films exhibited a low water vapor transfer rate, when compared to VC films and this property decreased by around 70 % following <b>calendering,</b> <b>for</b> all films tested. These results show that calendering {{could be used as a}} process to obtain films suitable for food packaging applications, where transparency, good mechanical performance and barrier properties are important.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{lubrication}} approximation theory (LAT) is used {{to provide}} numerical results <b>for</b> <b>calendering</b> sheets with a desired final thickness. The Herschel-Bulkley model of viscoplasticity is used, which reduces with appropriate modifications to the Bingham, the power-law and the Newtonian models. For a desired final sheet thickness, the results give the required thickness of the entering sheet {{as a function of}} the dimensionless power-law index (in the case of pseudoplasticity) and the dimensionless yield stress (in the case of viscoplasticity). The corresponding pressure-gradient and pressure distributions are also given. The integrated quantities of engineering interest are calculated. These include the maximum pressure, the roll-separating force, and the power input to the rolls. Both pseudoplasticity and viscoplasticity lead to thicker sheets than the Newtonian model for large entry thickness ratios, while they lead to thinner sheets for small entry thickness ratios. In the case of viscoplastic sheets, the interesting yielded/unyielded regions appear {{as a function of the}} dimensionless yield stress.

These measures should be quantifiable in time and money. The course of action for the project has been two case studies. The first were time studies of the change of rolls which were later analyzed based on the SMED-method. The second case study were interviews where all the staff with some sort of relation to the change of rolls were interviewed. The two case studies along with a present state description then resulted in a present state analysis where the results were presented. The results, based on the present state analysis, show that the problems that exist are closely related to the organizational work.

There are also several factors that collide between different work and that there are people with key competences which counteracts a stable system. To create a stable system, a standardized work has been developed for rotation of the work and to decrease the need for key competences. In the work method, there is also a step which is now being performed during the change of roll but which could just as easily be prepared in advance. It is recommended that this step is prepared in advance because it would decrease the time for the change of rolls...|$|R

Although many critics have tried to impose regularity of structure and content on Spenser 2 ̆ 7 s poem, and have attempted to define Spenser 2 ̆ 7 s viewpoint, it seems likely that Spenser was not attempting to present one consistent, inflexible viewpoint.;I propose that The Shepheardes Calender is a work consisting of many voices, not only the voices of the fictional characters within the work, but also the voices of Spenser the author, his persona Immerito, an unnamed narrator, and E. K., the critical commentator. The reader participates in the work as well, moving back and forth among levels of fiction and interpretation. Spenser invisibly manipulates the reader 2 ̆ 7 s responses by his use of paradox and irony, his inclusion of voices which contradict each other and often themselves, and his indication by various means, such as frames, that this work is fictional. Thus Spenser subverts the possibility that any one viewpoint be taken as that of the poem or poet. The analogy between human beings and nature, which is the thematic and structural foundation of the poem, is questioned by the use of these various techniques.;This dissertation is structured according to the calender format and that very analogy that is being questioned. Themes relating to fiction-making in spring, choosing landscapes in summer, escaping nature in the fall, and contradicting oneself and others in winter are explored in the various chapters.;In all sets of eclogues the analogy between human beings and nature is paradoxical. The identities of the speakers are inconsistent, the frames within frames subvert any clear boundaries between fictional and real worlds, and readers are unable to maintain secure positions for themselves in the text.

40|$|M. Tech. Binge {{eating is}} defined as eating {{an inordinate amount of}} food in a {{discrete}} period of time, during which the eater experiences a subjective loss of control (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). The event is often followed by emotional distress, including feelings of disgust, shame, fear, guilt or discomfort (Herrin, 2003). Binge eating is found in all eating disturbances, and is especially associated with binge eating disorder, which affects all races and both genders almost equally (Fairburn & Brownell, 2002). Current treatment protocols include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and traditional weight loss programmes (Birmingham & Treasure, 2010; Mitchell & Peterson, 2005; Wadden & Stunkard, 2002). The role of homoeopathy in the treatment of binge eating remains poorly explored. This research study was designed to examine the efficacy of homoeopathic similimum treatment on binge eating in males, following ten case studies. The research was carried out at the University of Johannesburg Homoeopathy Health Centre, from 8 July 2010 to 24 November 2010. Ten male participants, all between the ages of 23 and 42, took part in this research. Each participant was screened telephonically before their first consultation. Inclusion criteria included eating a large volume of food within a short space of time, and feeling a loss of control over eating habits. Exclusion criteria included a prior diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, bulemia nervosa or any morbidity associated with obesity, including diabetes mellitus and heart disease. Each participant attended a total of four consultations over a 12 week period. Follow-up consultations took place every three weeks. During each interview, the participants' severity and frequency of binge eating was assessed through their history, a self-assessment <b>calender</b> <b>for</b> recording binging incidence between consultations and by completing a psychometric evaluation.

40|$|The {{calendering}} {{and rolling}} processes {{are used in}} a wide variety of industries for the production of rolled sheets or films of specific thickness and final appearance.

These materials are rheologically viscoplastic, obeying the Herschel-Bulkley model. The results give the final sheet thickness and the torque as a function of the roll speed.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that superhydrophobicity can only be {{observed}} on rough surfaces, i.e., both chemical and physical effects contribute to superhydrophobicity. Classical theories by Wenzel [27] and Cassie and Baxter [28] have been used to explain observed contact angles on rough substrates: on rough, hydrophobic surfaces, the water droplet resides mostly on air and thus exhibits very high contact angles. Shibuichi et al. [29, 30] presented an elegant analysis of how apparent contact angles are affected by the surface roughness compared to a smooth surface. Here, in our study, the bulk compressibility of the reference paperboard has a minor effect on water contact angles whereas superhydrophobic TiO 2 nanoparticle-coated paperboard supports the analysis by Shibuichi et al. [29, 30]: increasing the number of calendering nips results in a decrease of the water contact angles on the hydrophobic side and increase on the hydrophilic side after the ultraviolet treatment in Figure  2. This is expected as adding the number of successive calendering nips will reduce surface roughness. The water contact angle is approximately 130 ° and 25 ° after 15 <b>calendering</b> nips <b>for</b> TiO 2 nanoparticle-coated samples without and with UV treatment, respectively. This indicates that the TiO 2 nanoparticles do not adhere to the steel calender roll but rather remain on the paperboard surface. Removal of the nanoparticles from the surface would bring the contact angles closer to those values of the reference paperboard in which the water contact angles are almost independent of both the number of calendering nips and the UV treatment.|$|R

A total of 44 cameras in 27 locations were used and 5, 777 functional trap nights (of 6, 542 survey nights) resulted in confirmed sightings of the Sunda clouded leopard Neofelis nebulosa, leopard cat Prionailurus bengalensis, marbled cat Pardofelis marmorata and flat-headed cat Prionailurus planiceps, representing {{four of the five}} wild felids of Borneo. The long-term use of fixed and roving cameras provided insight into the movements, occurrence and activity patterns of these elusive felids within in a disturbed peat-swamp forest. In an area of 145 km² (including buffer) the clouded leopard was the most commonly photographed felid (22 photo-captures of 53 total captures), followed by the leopard cat (21), flat-headed cat (7) and marbled cat (3). A total of 231 camera-trap nights were required to obtain the first photograph of a felid, the leopard cat, 704 for the clouded leopard, 3, 498 for the flat-headed cat, and 5, 423 (476 <b>calender</b> days) <b>for</b> the marbled cat. A female clouded leopard was not photographed until 5, 764 trap nights.

Integrated quantities of engineering interest are also calculated. These include the maximum pressure, the roll-separating force, and the power input to the rolls. Decreasing the power-law index or increasing the dimensionless yield stress lead to excess sheet thickness over the thickness at the nip.

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of the {{calendering}} of paper which incorporates relationships for both roll local thermal deformation and the stress-strain behaviour of paper in and after the nip was developed, validated, then used to demonstrate its application to model predictive control of calendering. The experimental determination of the stress-strain behaviour of paper included documenting the effect of initial temperature and moisture content as well as process parameters, and was expressed as the in-nip calendering equation. The rheological behaviour of commercial newsprint made from thermomechanical pulp {{was found to be}} a strong nonlinear function of temperature and moisture content over the wide range of 20 to 80 °C and 1 to 14 % moisture. A simplified model for the transient local deformation of a calender roll in response to a local cross-machine (CD) control action was determined and validated against the previous complete numerical analysis solution for a variety of roll designs and thermal boundary conditions. This model, appropriate for use in real-time control, was shown to be effective in seeking a compromise between the conflicting CD control objectives of large roll deformation, fine CD resolution and fast control response time. From the above two elements a dynamic {{model of the}} calendering process was developed by appropriate combination of the model of transient local calender roll deformation with the in-nip calendering equation used to estimate, at a specific CD position, in-nip strain from permanent strain. Use of the model shows that paper response to a control action is highly sensitive to local nip load and to temperature and moisture content of the paper. After validation with published measurements on an industrial calender, the effectiveness of this model for minimizing thickness nonuniformity in the CD dimension through implementation of model predictive control of <b>calendering</b> was demonstrated. <b>For</b> a multi-roll <b>calender</b> stack of industrial specifications this demonstration showed an impressive reduction in CD control response time through use of multi-step control action.

40|$|The {{world is}} heading towards the IoE (Internet of Everything) where {{everything}} will be connected to each other. New flexible, light-weight and low-cost electronic devices are needed to add intelligence everywhere in our surroundings. Conventional silicon-based manufacturing {{is not the best}} solution because silicon is mechanically rigid and expensive. One way to manufacture these devices cost-effectively in a very large scale is by roll-to-roll screen printing on flexible substrates. However, due to the low calculation performance of current printed electronics, silicon ICs are still needed to act as brains of the devices. Many studies about chip-on-flex or chip-on-film (COF) attachments are available but information about the integration of a silicon chip directly on a screen printed substrate is needed. This thesis investigates bare chip attachment on printed flexible circuitry and evaluates its subsequent level of bendability. The chip was attached on the high-density rotary screen printed circuitry using a flip-chip technique with anisotropic conductive adhesives (ACP and ACF). A selection of chips was stud bumped with gold. Chips without bumps were more challenging to bond due to the surface roughness of the screen printed lines and a small marginal of the suitable bonding pressure. A chip should be exactly parallel with the substrate while bonding so that the pressure is correct on all pads. After finding the suitable bonding parameters, approximately 90 % of the ACP bonded and 96 % of the ACF bonded interconnections worked without bumps. Stud bumping increased the yield almost to 100 % and decreased the contact resistances approximately 75 % making the contacts more reliable. <b>Calendering</b> was tested <b>for</b> printed lines to increase their uniformity and decrease the pad height deviation by heating and pressing them with high force. Calendering reduced the line heights by approximately 1 μm and decreased the surface roughness, but following this process there still existed at least a 2 μm variation in the line heights (nominal line height 5 μm). Bending reliability of the chip attachments on flexible plastic substrates was determined using a self-built bending test set-up which bends the sample between two rigid plates. All chip attachments studied withstood at least a 2. 5 cm bending radius. The main results of this thesis were to demonstrate bare die integration on screen printed circuitry and to show its suitability for flexible hybrid electronic applications. Still further development of the bonding process and materials are needed to achieve more reliable long-term solutions...|$|R

The descriptions of pollen grains are presented. Morphometric data for the pollen size were identified. The sample for each species consisted of 50 pollen grains. Microphotos of pollen grains which has been made by means of digital microscope Keyence -VHX 1000 are presented. The graph of pollen’s volume for studying species has been made. "Blooming calendar" has been composed following our phenological observations in 2015 and herbarium data for the Middle Russia during 1964 - 2014. There are two peaks of flowering. The first period comes at the early spring (Acer negundo, Fraxinus pennsylvanica), the second one - at the end of the summer (Asteraceae spp., Reynoutria spp.). Thus, the resettlement of invasive species results to prolongation of period with high concentration of pollen in the air, which is dangerous for allergies. Three groups of pollen grains according to their size has been detected. Small pollen grains (the average length of polar axis 19, 8 - 22, 3 µm) were observed in Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Cyclachaena xanthiifolia, Erigeron annuus and Fraxinus pennsylvanica. The average pollen grains (the average length of polar axis 25, 0 - 40, 1 µm) is observed for Helianthus tuberosus, Symphyotrichum × salignum, S. novae-angliae, Solidago canadensis, S. gigantea, Chamomilla suaveolens, Reynoutria bohemica, Amelanchier spicata, A. alnifolia, Acer negundo. Only Echinocystis lobata has large pollen grains with average length of polar axis 69, 1 µm. None species with the very large pollen (polar axis more than 100 µm) we observed. Clinical experiments for widely distributed alien Asteraceae (Helianthus tuberosus, Symphyotrichum × salignum, S. novae-angliae, Solidago spp., etc.) should be made. It is necessary to determine their ability to cause allergic reactions, because their pollen has echinate exine, similar with closely related species, which already recognized as the source of allergy...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT During calendering, {{which is}} done {{in order to improve}} its {{printing}} properties, the paper is compressed in one or more roll nips. Paper is a viscoelastic material and this will influence its performance during <b>calendering.</b> At least <b>for</b> woodfree paper, the imposed compressive stress has a much greater influence on the remaining deformation (after unloading) than the duration of the compression. A consequence of this is that a soft calender nip will produce a lower deformation than a hard calender nip at a given line load. Furthermore, a soft nip does not suppress surface topography in a size region corresponding to fibre flocs as much as a hard nip. In this perspective, soft-nip calendering constitutes a more uniform treatment than hard-nip calendering. However, the in-plane density variations increased with both types of calender nips, although less pronounced in the case of soft nip calendering. 	Calendering at a high temperature leads to a selective deformation of the surface region. This phenomenon can be used to optimise the relationship between mechanical and surface properties. At a given degree of deformation, properties like stiffness and gloss depends on the conditions at which the deformation was achieved. Calculations of an effective bending modulus can be used to characterise the stratification of the structure induced by the high-temperature calendering. A similar effect can in principle also be attained by establishing a moisture gradient in the thickness direction of the sheet. Moisture is more difficult to use (than temperature) for such a purpose. A water box application directly on a calender was one working strategy employed here in order to obtain moisture gradient calendering. 	A positive effect of precalendering a woodfree sheet with regard to surface smoothness could be seen also after coating and final calendering, although it is expected that some of the precalendering effect is offset due to contact with the aqueous phase. Final calendering led to some development of gloss variations. This might indicate an uneven surface porosity, which may have a negative influence on printing properties. However, the precalendering facilitated a more uniform coating layer, which is expected to {{have a positive effect on}} printing properties. In total, it seemed that precalendering was on the whole beneficial for the final properties of the paper product. The degree of precalender deformation controlled the final properties. Speed, type of nip or temperature as such in the precalender operation, appeared not to have major influence on the final properties. 	Water/paper interactions is a common denominator in many cases of interplay between process steps in papermaking. Minimising these interactions appears in many cases to be a useful route to improve the relation beneficial between mechanical and surface properties, since water exposure can lead to an irreversible deformation of the surface structure. Penetration of water and water-based fluids appeared to be controlled mostly by the openness, or porosity of the surface and on the external pressure used when applying the fluid. Wet-pressing and calendering are processes that lead to closure of the surface, which helps to minimise the water penetration in subsequent process steps, e. g. surface sizing and coating...|$|R
40|$|Calendering is {{a process}} used for the {{production}} of rolled sheets or films of specific thickness and final appearance, and involves the feed of a pair of co-rotating heated rolls (usually with radius to minimum gap ratio, R/H 0 ? 100) with a material to form a sheet. The process is widely used in a variety of industries, such as plastics, rubber, food, aluminium, paper, etc. Many materials used in calendering are frequently non-Newtonian, exhibiting either pseudoplastic (viscosity dependant on shear rate) or viscoplastic (presence of a yield stress) rheological behaviour. The present Doctoral Thesis falls into the fields of computational rheology and rheometry, and in processing of materials, and aims at the full analysis and understanding of the process for the above rheologically complex materials. Experimental measurements were carried out for two pseudoplastic -viscoplastic materials which are widely used in the food industry, namely “mozzarella” cheese and bread dough. Rheological characterization experiments were conducted for both materials, followed by rolling experiments (R/H 0 < 10). Regarding the rolling experiments, the response of final thickness and torque was studied with regard to changes in roll speed and initial thickness of the samples. Finally, a stable experimental window was determined for the rolling of both materials, based on device limitations and surface defects. With regard to the theoretical-computational part, the analysis of the process was first carried out using the Lubrication Approximation Theory (LAT) and the Herschel-Bulkley model of viscoplasticity. The mathematical modeling and the computer programs that were created, resulted in the solution of the problem for various non-Newtonian materials, which exhibit, or not, slip at the wall, {{as well as for the}} two cases of desired initial or final sheet thickness. A full parametric study was performed, and results include the calculation of the sheet thickness and key engineering values (pressure, force, torque), as well as yielded areas for viscoplastic materials exhibiting yield stress. A comparison of LAT simulation results with experimental results is also presented for pseudoplastic materials (using results available in the literature) and for viscoplastic materials (using the experiments of the present Thesis). For pseudoplastic fluids, it was proved that LAT with slip correctly predicts the shape of pressure distribution and the values of the rest of the quantities of interest, such as final sheet thickness and torque. For viscoplastic materials, there is qualitative agreement, as LAT is based on shear flow. A full two-dimensional analysis was next conducted based on the Finite Element Method (FEM), for the solution of the conservation equations and the rheological constitutive equations. Non-isothermal solution with slip at the wall confirmed previous results for PVC. For viscoplastic materials the 2 -D analysis proved the inability of LAT to correctly predict yielded-unyielded areas, which were then correctly predicted. As opposed to LAT, the comparison with the experimental results showed that there is good quantitative agreement for the torque for both materials, and brought out the need to integrate all stresses (shear and normal) for the calculation of torque, since the flow is fully two-dimensional. For the final sheet thickness, only qualitative agreement was found, with the simulations under-predicting the experimental values. This brought out viscoelastic recoil after detachment, where the material acquires a free surface. Viscoelasticity was not however included in the present Thesis. The present Doctoral Thesis led to a better understanding of the process of <b>calendering</b> and rolling <b>for</b> non-Newtonian materials, such as polymers and some foods that exhibit pseudoplastic and viscoplastic behavior. A number of problems have been solved and others were presented, that are conducive for further research. The better understanding of the process for non-Newtonian materials can help in the efficient design of the process, which can prove beneficial for both research and industrial production. ...|$|R
