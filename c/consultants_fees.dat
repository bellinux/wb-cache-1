50|$|Once {{the patient}} is admitted, all {{expenses}} pertaining to the patient are borne by the hospital and thereafter the hospital sends bill to the insurer NIC for reimbursement. These expenses include bed charges in general ward, nursing and boarding charges, fees of doctors involved in the treatment (surgeons, anaesthetists, medical practitioner etc.), <b>consultants</b> <b>fees,</b> cost of anaesthesia, blood bottles, oxygen, operating theater charges, cost of surgical appliances, medicines and drugs, cost of prosthetic devices, implants, X-Ray and diagnostic tests, food to inpatient, one side transport cost (from Hospital to residence of patient only by bus or railway.

40|$|Estimating {{the cost}} of preconstruction {{services}} (PCSs) during the early phases of highway project development is an important task requiring an increased level of attention. Research has found a link between early investment in PC planning and design services and final project costs. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to assess current estimating practices and propose a cost and scope breakdown structure (CSBS) framework to structure functional level estimation of <b>consultant</b> <b>fees.</b> Such a framework is promoted to reduce the chance that underfunded PCSs may degrade postaward construction contract cost certainty. This study found that PCSs were generally viewed as a minor component of a project’s budget and were sometimes estimated without subsequent preconstruction cost control or accountability. Current practices for <b>consultant</b> <b>fee</b> estimating by state departments of transportation (DOTs) documented in this study show little standardization in estimating practices across and within transportation agencies. As a consequence, many individuals are creating their own tools to develop PCS cost estimates. The result is that national and regional consultants that work in more than a single state are forced to expend additional effort to maintain agency-specific work task databases; the cost no doubt is passed back to the agency in increased overhead costs. This study found that application of a CSBS to classify specific work tasks and utilization of a database of previous project cost information promote consistency and aid contract negotiations with consultants...|$|R
40|$|Two-envelope fee bidding is used {{frequently}} in allocating commissions to willing consultants such as architects, engineers and surveyors. <b>Consultant</b> <b>fees</b> and technical scores are normally aggregated {{to form a}} total score. The consultant obtaining the highest total score is usually awarded the commission. The consultant's objective {{is to get the}} highest total score possible because this maximizes the chance of winning. Consultants can submit to the procurer any of a number of different technical proposals which is then converted to a technical score. Only one technical score+fee combination will result in the highest total score, i. e. the optimum technical score+fee combination. This paper offers consultants an approach to better identify their optimum technical score+fee combination. In using this approach consultants need to develop a total score continuum based on (1) the consultant's original technical proposal and fee, (2) the absolute lowest fee and corresponding technical score, and (3) the absolute highest technical score and corresponding fee. The total score becomes the dependent variable and the fee the independent variable. Since the total score continuum is regressed on three points it will almost certainly be curvilinear in shape. Given that the optimum total score is at the highest point of the continuum, the optimum fee can be determined through differentiation. The corresponding technical score can then be found. After adjusting the original technical proposal to reflect the corresponding technical score, the optimum fee and adjusted technical proposal can then be submitted to the procurer.

40|$|Consultants' {{fees and}} {{technical}} submissions in two-envelope fee tendering are usually converted to scores. The fee scores and technical (quality) scores are then multiplied by predetermined weightings and aggregated. To preserve the desired {{influence of the}} predetermined weightings, the fee score and technical score variability differences need to be balanced, otherwise, when aggregated, one variable will end up dominating the other variable. Currently, such adjustments are not undertaken in the popular two-envelope fee tendering models. It seems {{that in many cases}} the consultant selection becomes biased in favour of the lowest fee rather than the quality. Important influences that contribute to the fee-technical score variability imbalance include suicidal fees and non-serious fees (which increases fee variability) and similar size consultant firms with similar experience and workload levels offering similar, if not identical, services (which reduces technical score variability). This paper offers four alternative approaches to the correction of the fee-technical score variability imbalance. If the client is able to distinguish between suicidal, serious and non-serious fees, then it is suggested that first the consultants submitting suicidal and non-serious fees should be disregarded. A normalization approach (in which the <b>consultant's</b> technical and <b>fee</b> scores are re-scaled to fall between unity and zero) should then be applied. If the client is unable or unwilling to distinguish between suicidal, serious and non-serious fees then aggregating {{on the basis of the}} <b>consultants</b> <b>fee</b> and technical score rankings appears to be the best method out of the three remaining approaches.

40|$|A {{conflict}} of interest is a delicate situation where {{a person with a}} confidence role like a physician has professional or personal interests competing with the mission he/she has received, making him difficult to perform his/her duty with impartiality. Commercial or financial conflicts of interest of a physician can be personal and direct (gifts, travels, honoraries, <b>consultant</b> <b>fees,</b> etc.) or indirect (in relationship with those of the family or of the institution). There are also non financial conflicts of interest such as the anonymous peer review of the work performed by a friend or a competitor. An abundant literature mainly deals with the links to the pharmaceutical industry. Those links may lead to restrictions for publication and access to the data obtained by the research. The physicians have difficulties for accepting disclosing their {{conflict of}} interest.

In their FAQ, Perverted-Justice defends this consulting fee, citing, among other things, the costs of keeping its website running and the fact that [...] "... everyone except themselves and the predators are being compensated for this massive amount of effort."
