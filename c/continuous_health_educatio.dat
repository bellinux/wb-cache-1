40|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>health</b> {{monitoring}} using wireless body area {{networks of}} implantable and wearable medical devices (IWMDs) is envisioned as a transformative approach to healthcare. Rapid advances in biomedical sensors, low-power electronics, and wireless communications have brought this vision to {{the verge of}} reality. However, key challenges still remain to be addressed. The constrained sizes of IWMDs imply that they are designed with very limited processing, storage, and battery capacities. Therefore, {{there is a very}} strong need for efficiency in data collection, analysis, storage, and communication. In this paper, we first quantify the energy and storage requirements of a <b>continuous</b> personal <b>health</b> monitoring system that uses eight biomedical sensors: (1) heart rate, (2) blood pressure, (3) oxygen saturation, (4) body temperature, (5) blood glucose, (6) accelerometer, (7) electrocardiogram (ECG), and (8) electroencephalogram (EEG). Our analysis suggests that there exists a significant gap between the energy and storage requirements for long-term continuous monitoring and the capabilities of current devices. To enable energy-efficient <b>continuous</b> <b>health</b> monitoring, we propose schemes for sample aggregation, anomaly-driven transmission, and compressive sensing to reduce the overheads of wirelessly transmitting, storing, and encrypting/authenticating the data. We evaluate these techniques and demonstrate that they result in two to three orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy and storage requirements, and can help realize the potential of long-term <b>continuous</b> <b>health</b> monitoring...|$|R

Value-motivational and strategic aspect:: of study behavior were assessed by a questionnaire. Multivariate analyses of variance were carried ort using the study behavior dimensions as the independent and the performance factor scores as the dependent variables.

40|$|Abstract—Public health {{education}} is a key component in the variety of services provided by local health departments, particularly for the low-income demographic. In addition to helping the participants to live a healthier lifestyle, nutrition education sessions are a required component of a specific program for low-income mothers and children, entitled the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). However, some women in the Utah County WIC program were not receiving the sessions because the inconvenient class times and scheduling difficulty. With the increasing availability of the internet access by WIC participants, we can increase the availability and effectiveness of the nutrition education by providing courses online via the Utah County’s WIC website. We are designing a system consisting of a web interface and a database backend, where health workers can author and publish interactive content, track users’ progress, and evaluate {{the outcome of the}} courses taken.

The aim of the study was to determine the level of development of basic motor skills of manipulative kind of ball rolling in male children aged 7 to 10 years. All groups of respondents statistically are significantly different, except for the respondents 9 and 10 years old. A monotonous increasing trend is present in the average score of the skill and the percentage of master levels of manifestation of the skill in the first and third criteria. Consistency was not achieved among groups of respondents in terms of the most difficult and the easiest criteria for manifestation. This approach, by monitoring the level of development of motor skills in students, is of great benefit to the teacher, thus enabling more effective and efficient planning and programming of the lessons in physical and <b>health</b> <b>educatio...</b>|$|R

One of the basic difficulties faced in efforts to improve the lot of the Indian in todayys society is that of communication between the Indian and the non-Indian. Government and private agencies concerned with such matters are turning to the academic community in terms of funded research, curriculum development, and teacher development. To respond more meaningfully to these requests, the scholar must be aware of the investigations of his colleagues, past and present.

The use of categorical health variables to estimate a <b>continuous</b> <b>health</b> variable is an usual procedure in healthstudies. The most common approaches (ordered probit/logit model and interval regression model) do not admit any skewness {{in the distribution of}} health. In the present study a new procedure is suggested, that is attaching a log-normal distribution to health values. Different scaling procedures have been compared, with data obtained from the Catalan Health Survey (2006). The validity of the scaling approaches is assessed by measuring to what extent the health values derived from categorical health variables suit the actual health values. Two different health tariffs have been used for each procedure (VAS tariff and TTO tariff), so that the results are robust to the selection of a metric. In general, models under log normality outperform the other approaches. Health-Related Quality of Life, Health Measurement, Interval...|$|R

There are widely {{recognized}} problems with the US health care system, including rapidly increasing costs and access to oral health. During the last decade, there has been a huge influx and push toward interprofessional education programs; however, these programs conveniently leave out dental hygiene. Interprofessional education can bring forth the collaboration, communication, and teamwork necessary to provide a comprehensive health care plan to treat oral health care needs in patients. As the advanced practice for dental hygiene emerges, it is imperative that the educational qualifications of dental hygienists are sufficient to enable them to safely provide the scope of services and care encompassed in these new expanded roles and to effectively participate as an interprofessional team member.
