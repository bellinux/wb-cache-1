40|$|Many {{perishable}} {{products and}} services have multiple capacity attributes. Shipping <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>container</b> liners, for example, is measured by both volume and weight. Containers with different size consume various capacities in the two dimensions. Restaurant revenue management aims to maximize the revenue per available seat-hour that captures both the number of dining tables and service manpower. Similar issues arise in the air cargo, trucking and health care industries. We study the revenue management problem with two capacity features and formulate the problem as a continuous-time stochastic control model. Unlike heuristic approaches, we derive the optimal solution in an analytical form. Computation of the optimal solution is fairly efficient. With certain conditions we explore the structural properties of the optimal solution. We show that if the revenue rate is concave in the capacity usage, the expected value of marginal capacity is monotone. As a result, the control policy is featured by a sequence of thresholds which displays a significant difference when the remaining capacity-mix varies. Numerical examples are provided.

The {{mark in the}} form of a cross on a rectangular base is put on a neck of an import vessel of the last third of the X-XI centuries found in a cistern excavation in dwelling house of the IX-XI centuries in Cherson. Among medieval graffiti from Cherson the exact analogy of this image is unknown. There are some examples of drawing of a similar symbol on transport vessels of the Byzantine time from the Eastern Crimea and Sarkel. Crosses of different kinds have received a wide spreading as building marks on a tile during a medieval time. The cross on a base, so called the cross on the Golgotha, is known among the graffiti on the churches of ancient Kiev. The theme of the cross on an eminence is traced in symbolical images of Christian temples; such drawings were found in the church of Cyril in Kiev and on Early Bulgarian strengthened settlement Tzar Asen. The cross on a base is a traditional image on coins and the seals of Byzantine Cherson. In researches of the studying of medieval graffiti there is no common opinion about appointment of this symbol: a sign on the owner of a thing, a workshop sign, customs marks, <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>container</b> and the description of the goods.

Shoulder in left and {{right side of the}} run way, is a difficult area of land planted with grass impregnated, so that water flows more in the surface soil and less infiltration. Around airports, especially around the run way and shoulder, there should be an open channel to drain water drainage (interseption ditch) from the outer side of the airport. To create a flood hydrograph first count of Synthetic Unit Hydrograph Method Nakayasu. Analysis of drainage channel dimensions obtained from the discharge peaks in the flood hydrograph.

40|$|Aggregate {{comparisons}} of the efficiency of container ports using techniques such as Data Envelopment Analysis usually rely {{on the number of}} Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) moved across the quay face per year to provide the measure of output from which to derive efficiency measures. This may be {{due in part to the}} difficulty of obtaining large sample publicly available data sets at a more disaggregated level. Detailed simulation of individual container terminals using actual vessel sizes and schedules, together with detailed breakdowns of containers by size and intermodal transfer (land-sea or maritime transshipment), suggests that the nature of the market served can have a significant effect on the throughput of terminals managed and operated at similar levels of efficiency. The manufacturing centres in the Pearl River Delta are served by large, world-class terminals at Yantian and Hong Kong. These use similar technologies, operating methods and yard management systems. They operate at similar levels of efficiency at the micro-level (crane container handling rates, etc), but over the last 6 years the markets they serve have steadily diverged. This paper discusses the results of a preliminary study of the effects of exogenous market differences on the potential throughput <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>container</b> terminals with similar levels of efficiency as measured at the micro-level. Factors considered include the proportion of containers of differing size in the market, vessel size, the number of container moves per vessel, and the relative size of the transshipment and landed container markets. The paper concludes that the aggregate effect of these factors on throughput as measured in TEUs can be very significant and that aggregate analyses of container terminal efficiency should disaggregate the output measure into separate components. This will require larger sample sizes and more comprehensive data sets, particularly if varying returns to scale are to be assessed. It also considers the specification of frontier models of container terminal efficiency and puts forward proposals to ensure that the requirements of isotonicity and homogeneity are addressed and that the sensitivity of these models to data errors, weakly correlated inputs and outlying observations are taken into account.

40|$|Since the {{container}} {{revolution in the}} mid-sixties and the scale increase it caused, seaports face changing technological developments and economic circumstances. Terminal operators and port authorities {{have to deal with}} an increasing number of uncertainties. Especially in container transport competition plays a major role. Containers have a relative large mobility and container transportation routes are less bounded to modalities, ports and logistic chains. As a consequence the substitutability of ports is considerable. Port selection within the logistic chain is part of the selection of the logistic chain which is the primary choice. The market power of shipping companies has been enhanced {{to the extent that they}} have gained control of logistic chains. The <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>container</b> carriers is still growing and as long as there is enough freight to transport they tend to call at less and less ports. There are huge challenges for container ports and their terminals to remain competitive and to handle the anticipated growth with an increase of their productivity, a reduction of port congestion (e. g. Maasvlakte II) and improvement of their hinterland accessibility (e. g. the Betuweline). The overall objective of this research is to provide port authorities with a tool to support their strategic investment planning in a competitive market. The tool should provide port authorities with information on the impacts of, structural and non-structural, capacity improvement measures on the future demand for container service. The present thesis contributes to this objective by the development of the Port Competition Model, a supporting planning tool. The port can be considered a node in a transport network with competition, which faces a dynamic situation concerning the timing and sizing of capacity expansions of other ports and changes in the transport network. The challenge is to incorporate the aspects of the full dynamics of port competition over the network in the Port Competition Model by simulation of the competitive strategies of other ports and the sensitivity of decisions on port investment for such strategies. To this end the Port Competition Model needs to represent varying market shares over the years in order to reflect strategies of other ports. When port planning is based on varying market shares of competitive ports it can be defined as "dynamic port planning". The focus of this research is the reaction of a particular port on a change in the transportation network. A scenario for such change is the entry of new routes via a competing port. This leads to decreased demands and benefits for the particular port. Potential reactions of the ports on this change include investment in port expansion and improvement of hinterland connections. The expansion of a port's surface area takes a central place in this research. The density of ports in Northwest Europe is the highest in the world. This implies severe competition. Four of the five biggest European ports are situated within the Hamburg - Le Havre range: Rotterdam, Antwerp, Hamburg and Bremen. Within this range the ports compete mainly on transit containers. The Port Competition Model has been developed for these four ports within the Hamburg - Le Havre range. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
