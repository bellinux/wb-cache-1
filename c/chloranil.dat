The distribution patterns of total PCDD/Fs and 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted PCDD/Fs were elucidated in detail. The TEQ values of toxic PCDD/Fs in all chemicals were in the range of 5. 03 - 1379. 55 ng I-TEQ/kg. The contribution of OCDD and OCDF in phthalocyanine green was 75 % of the total TEQ. For <b>chloranils,</b> the maximum contribution of toxic PCDD/Fs was from 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted HxCDF and 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted HpCDF. The TEQ of HxCDF and HpCDF in chloranil- 1 was 90 % and in chloranil- 2 was 71 %. And the toxic contribution increased with the degree of chlorination for PCDFs. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|In {{the case}} at hand, heating acetate (1) with <b>chloranil</b> gives the {{conjugated}} dieneone (2), and reaction of that compound with methylmagnesium bromide {{in the presence of}} cuprous chloride leads to addition of the methyl group to position 7 {{at the end of the}} conjugated system (3). The stereochemistry of the product again illustrates the preference for additions from the backside. The alcohol at C17 is then oxidized to a ketone (4). Enamines are commonly used to activate adjacent functions; they are also not infrequently used, as in this case, as protecting groups. Thus, reaction of the intermediate with pyrrolidine gives dienamine (5). This transformation emphasizes the clear difference in reactivity between ketones at C7 and C17.

5000|$|... 6-Methyl-16-dehydropregnenolone acetate (5) {{is the key}} {{intermediate}} to {{the preparation}} of both melengesterol acetate and medrogestone. Petrov and his collaborators have devised several interesting schemes that go back to diosgenin as the starting point. These schemes perform the necessary modifications in rings A and B with the sapogenin side chain still in place. In essence this approach employs this side chain as a protecting group for the future 16-dehydro-20-ketone function. In one of these routes, diosgenin is first converted to the 3-toluenesulfonate (1). Solvolysis of this homoallylic alcohol derivative affords the 3,5-cyclosteroid (2), via the cyclopropyl carbinyl ion (carbenium ion) (not shown). (This general reaction was probably first found in the steroids and bore the name of [...] "i-steroid rearrangement.") Oxidation of the product by means of PCC affords the ketone. Reaction of this with methylmagnesium iodide affords two isomeric carbinols with the α-isomer predominating (3). Solvolysis {{in the presence of}} a nucleophile such as acetic acid reverses the cyclopropylcarbinyl transformation to afford homoallylic acetate. Removal of the sapogenin side chain leads to the desired product (5).Substitution at the 16 position was found to lead to further potentiation of progestational activity. Reaction with diazomethane at the conjugated double bond at 16 gives first the pyrazole (6). This heterocycle affords the 16 methyl enone on pyrolysis (7). Selective epoxidation of the conjugated double bond to the 16,17α-epoxide over that at 5,6 is achieved by oxidation with basic hydrogen peroxide (8). Opening of this tetrasubstituted oxirane ring in acid proceeds with loss of a proton from the β position (16 methyl) (9) to afford the desired 16-methylene-17α-hydroxy-20-ketone functionality in the D ring (10). The product is saponified and then the subject of an Oppenauer oxidation, which is then dehydrogenated to the 4,6-diene with <b>chloranil</b> (11). Acetylation under forcing conditions completes the synthesis of melengesterol acetate.|$|E

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of {{discotic liquid crystal}} materials based on the triphenylene core normally involves the preparation of hexahydroxytriphenylene.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4) {{constitutes}} the principal water channel {{in the brain}} and is clustered at the perivascular astrocyte endfeet. This specific distribution of AQP 4 {{plays a major role in}} maintaining water homeostasis in the brain. A growing body of evidence points to a role of the dystroglycan complex and its interaction with perivascular laminin in the clustering of AQP 4 at perivascular astrocyte endfeet. Indeed, mice lacking components of this complex or in which laminin-dystroglycan interaction is disrupted show a delayed onset of brain edema due to a redistribution of AQP 4 away from astrocyte endfeet. It is therefore important to identify inhibitory drugs of laminin-dependent AQP 4 clustering which may prevent or reduce brain edema. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study we used primary rat astrocyte cultures to screen a library of > 3, 500 chemicals and identified 6 drugs that inhibit the laminin-induced clustering of dystroglycan and AQP 4. Detailed analysis of the inhibitory drug, <b>chloranil,</b> revealed that its inhibition of the clustering is due to the metalloproteinase- 2 -mediated ß-dystroglycan shedding and subsequent loss of laminin interaction with dystroglycan. Furthermore, chemical variants of <b>chloranil</b> induced a similar effect on ß-dystroglycan and this was prevented by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings reveal the mechanism of action of <b>chloranil</b> in preventing the laminin-induced clustering of dystroglycan and AQP 4 and validate the use of high-throughput screening as a tool to identify drugs that modulate AQP 4 clustering and that could be tested in models of brain edema...|$|E
