5|$|The {{primitive}} jetty {{was damaged}} {{in a storm}} of 1659, so that in 1708 leading local wool merchant Sir William Wyndham built a new harbour costing £1,000, with a stronger pier. The main export at this time was kelp, made by burning seaweed for use in glass making. In the 19th century trade increased with the export of iron ore from the Brendon Hills mainly to Newport for onward transportation to the Ebbw Vale Steelworks, paper, flour and gypsum. In 1843 the esplanade was built by George Wyndham, 4th Earl of Egremont, and in 1855 a new harbour was commissioned to cope with increased iron ore trade. The existing harbour was damaged and several vessels wrecked by the Royal Charter Storm on 26 October 1859. A new east pier and wharf was completed in 1861−62 by James Abernethy. This allowed shipping movement to reach a peak, with over 1,100 ship movements per annum. Harbour trade was aided by {{the coming of the}} railway, with two independent railways terminating at Watchet from the mid 1860s. The West Somerset Mineral Railway ran down from the iron mines on the Brendon Hills, and the West Somerset Railway <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the Bristol and Exeter Railway at Norton Fitzwarren. At the peak in the trade during the late 19th century 40,000 tons of ore were exported annually.|$|E

In the past, they were a Woodland people who thrived on hunting, fishing and farming.|$|E
25|$|The warm {{period during}} between 7000–3000 BCE {{is called the}} Holocene climatic optimum. Towards {{the end of the}} Archaic period, {{seasonal}} weather was a time of Meridional overturning circulation and large storms <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the Gulf of Mexico. The western and northern valleys of West Virginia became warm and dry with less precipitation around 2550 BCE, causing the bottom land flora to thin out and creating occasional major floods and serious erosion during {{the early part of this}} transitional weather pattern.|$|E

25|$|On 14 August 2009, Schmeichel {{signed for}} League Two side Notts County {{in a deal}} that is {{believed}} to have broken the club's previous transfer record. The transfer reunited Schmeichel with his former Manchester City manager, Sven-Göran Eriksson, who had recently been appointed director of football for Notts. He was the highest paid player at the club, earning ₤1 million annually. He made his debut on 22 August and kept a clean sheet in the side's 3–0 win against Dagenham & Redbridge. In September 2009, Schmeichel almost scored with an audacious overhead kick against Morecambe when he <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> a corner late on in the game.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} {{theories}} for how the smallpox virus first reached the Stó:lō in late 1782. The first is that the disease <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> Mexico spreading with overland travelers, the second and more likely theory {{is that it was}} brought to the coast through trade routes with Europeans. It is estimated that the epidemic killed two thirds of the Stó:lō population, approximately 61%, within six weeks. During the epidemic traditional responses to illness, although effective for illnesses that were common to the area, likely make the outbreak worse. One method was gathering around the sick person’s bed to sing and pray. This exposed more people to the virus. Other practices included cleansing sweats and cold morning baths which would have shocked the infected person’s body causing more harm.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 23, Warren reached Mount Carmel Church and paused for instructions. Hancock's corps <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> behind and the two units got hopelessly mixed up on the road. The corps commanders decided that Hancock would {{continue}} along the Telegraph Road to Chesterfield Bridge while Warren would cross the North Anna upstream at Jericho Mills. There were no significant fortifications to their front. Lee had misjudged Grant's plan, assuming that any advance against the North Anna would be a mere diversion, while {{the main body of}} Grant's army continued its flanking march to the east. At the Chesterfield Bridge crossing the Telegraph Road, a small South Carolina brigade under Col. John W. Henagan had created a dirt redoubt, and there was a small party guarding the railroad bridge downstream, but all of the other river crossings were left undefended. Grant had been presented with a golden opportunity if he moved quickly enough to take advantage of it.|$|E

25|$|Boussart {{played a}} key role in the Battle of Prenzlau on 28 October. Marshal Joachim Murat led Grouchy's division, Marc Antoine de Beaumont's 3rd Dragoon Division, Antoine Lasalle's light cavalry brigade, and 3,000 of Marshal Jean Lannes' {{infantry}} against Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen's 12,000 Prussians. The Prussians approached Prenzlau from the northwest while the French <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the southwest. Murat sent Lasalle's brigade directly against Hohenlohe's covering force while ordering one of Beaumont's brigades to make a wide circuit to the west. Meanwhile, he detached Boussart's brigade and sent it to ford a stream on the western outskirts of the town. Boussart's horsemen charged the Prussian marching column, smashing into it from the side. The attack was a complete success. The French dragoons hacked their way through the column and seized many prisoners. Boussart's troopers cleared the road as far as the city gates, inflicted about 1,000 casualties and captured eight guns. Meanwhile, Beaumont's division surrounded and captured the now-isolated Prussian rear guard. Shortly afterward, Murat bluffed a dazed Hohenlohe into surrendering with 10,000 men.|$|E
25|$|Sixth Army {{advanced}} {{from the}} north via Kalach and Fourth Panzer Army <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the south through Kotelnikovo. In the first few days, the XIV Panzer Corps opened a corridor between {{the main body of}} Sixth Army and the northern Stalingrad suburbs at the Volga. In the south, Soviet resistance repulsed the Fourth Panzer Army. On 29 August another attempt was made with Hoth turning his forces west directly through the center of 64th Army. The attack was unexpectedly successful and Fourth Panzer Army got behind 62nd and 64th Armies with the chance to encircle and cut off 62nd Army. Von Weichs ordered Sixth Army to complete the encirclement; a Soviet counter-attack held up the advance for three days and the Soviets escaped and retreated towards Stalingrad. The rapid German advance caused a slump in morale among the Soviet troops, who retreated in chaos, abandoning the outer defences of the city. After defeating the last Soviet counter-attacks, Sixth Army resumed its offensive on 2 September, linking up with Fourth Panzer Army the following day. On 12 September, the Germans entered Stalingrad.|$|E
25|$|At Podolínec, the Mongols {{devastated the}} {{settlement}} {{and the area}} around it after some skirmishes with the local militia. At Stary Sącz, the siege lasted roughly a month without bringing any tangible results. The town was well stocked, with strong walls and a good garrison. Meanwhile, the Hungarian king had approved action against the Mongols, and tasked the noble George of Sóvár with leading the Hungarian expedition. His expeditionary force <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> Podolínec and Kežmarok, adding local Polish troops to their number on the way.Krakow, p.217 The Hungarian-Polish force completely surprised a small Mongol army of 1,000 men and annihilated it at the Battle of Stary Sącz, killing the army's commander. This was the last major engagement of the invasion. Leszek mobilized the main Polish army in the meantime and sought to join it with George's Hungarians; recognizing that his remaining forces would be dispersed and outnumbered if they remained, Nogai regrouped his men and retreated from Poland with most of his army intact. He arrived back in Ruthenia in late January, 1288, where his soldiers plundered the villages of his vassals in Galicia.|$|E

25|$|Four {{explosion}}s {{were clearly}} detected. The fourth explosion {{was so strong}} that the stern of the Cuban ship was submerged and water came in through the hatchway of the engine room. At that time the hydrophones reported a sound similar to a liquid bubbling when it comes from a submerged container that is suddenly opened. The sounds indicated that the U-boat had been hit. To finish the U-boat off, the patrol boat launched two more depth charges, set to explode at 250 feet. A few minutes later, a dark stain was observed {{on the surface of the}} water. A spurt of a black and viscous substance smelling like gasoline <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the deep. Although there was little doubt that the U-boat had been sunk, Delgado was ordered to take a sample of the contaminated seawater to confirm the victory. But even then it wasn't until after the war, when the Allies seized Germany's naval records, that proof of U-176s sinking was found. According to the seized documents, U-176 was under the command of Captain Lieutenant Reiner Dierksen, had sunk eleven enemy ships in her career, and was herself sunk with all hands lost.|$|E
