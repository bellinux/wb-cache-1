5|$|In December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Carol would be filmed in Cincinnati, Ohio, and production offices would open in early January 2014, with filming expected from mid-March through May. In February 2014, the Greater Cincinnati & Northern Kentucky Film Commission released the solicitation from producers for extras and vintage vehicles. Principal photography began on March 12, 2014, at Eden Park in Cincinnati. Various locations around Cincinnati, Ohio were used during production, including Downtown Cincinnati, Hyde Park, Over-the-Rhine, Wyoming, <b>Cheviot,</b> and Hamilton, as well as Alexandria, Kentucky. Except for the Waterloo, Iowa, motel room, which was a set built for privacy during filming of the love scene, actual locations were used for interior and exterior settings. The second floor of a now-defunct department store served as the location for the toy department of the fictional Frankenberg's. Filming was completed on May 2, 2014. The film was shot in 34 days. Edward Lachman shot Carol on Super 16 mm film using 35 mm format lenses.|$|E
5|$|The {{defining}} {{factor in}} the geography of Scotland is {{the distinction between the}} Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands are further divided into the Northwest Highlands and the Grampian Mountains by the fault line of the Great Glen. The Lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the Central Lowlands and the higher terrain of the Southern Uplands, which included the <b>Cheviot</b> hills, over which the border with England came to run {{by the end of the}} period. Some of these regions were further divided by mountains, major rivers and marshes. The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in width, and because it contains most of the good quality agricultural land and has easier communications, could support most of the urbanisation and elements of conventional Medieval government. The Southern Uplands, and particularly the Highlands were economically less productive and much more difficult to govern. This provided Scotland with a form of protection, as minor English incursions had to cross the difficult Southern Uplands; two major attempts at conquest by the English, under Edward I and then Edward III, were unable to penetrate the Highlands, from where potential resistance could reconquer the Lowlands. But it also made those areas problematic to govern for Scottish kings and much of the political history of the era after the wars of independence centred on attempts to resolve problems of entrenched localism.|$|E

The Uplands and Highlands had a relatively short growing season and, in the extreme case of the upper Grampians, this was an ice free season of four months or less and for much of the Highlands and Uplands of seven months or less.

In 1564 there were thirty-three days of continual frost, and rivers and lochs froze. The 1690s marked its lowest point, leading to the Seven ill years of famine.|$|E
