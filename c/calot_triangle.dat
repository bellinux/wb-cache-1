40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the approach to}} laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) {{in the treatment of}} complicated gallbladder disease. MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 81 patients with complicated gallbladder disease admitted to the Department of General Surgery in our hospital from August 2007 to November 2013, including 66 cases of acute cholecystitis, 14 cases of atrophic cholecystitis, and 1 case of Mirizzi syndrome. All laparoscopic operations were completed using the aspirating dissector and ultrasonic knife and lasted for 1. 5 - 3 h. ResultsLC was successfully completed in 79 cases. One case had common hepatic duct injury during operation, which was treated by laparoscopic suture repair; one case had intraoperative bleeding and was converted to laparotomy; one case was suspected of having Mirizzi syndrome before operation and was converted to laparotomy after the syndrome was confirmed during operation. ConclusionLaparoscopic cholecystectomy is safe and feasible in the treatment of complicated gallbladder disease. The key to successful treatment is preoperative evaluation of this disease, intraoperative use of aspirating dissector and ultrasonic knife for dissecting the <b>Calot</b> <b>triangle,</b> antegrade resection combined with retrograde resection, and total resection combined with partial resection, which can effectively avoid intraoperative hemorrhage and bile duct injury...|$|E

However, it is rarely described in its synchronous form. Clinical caseA 43 year-old woman attending the clinic for right upper quadrant pain of 11 days duration. The patient refers to intermittent radiating pain in the right side, with positive Murphy, tachycardia, and fever. The laboratory results showed white cells 16, 200 /mm 3, glucose 345 mg/dl, abnormal liver function tests. Acute cholecystitis was reported with ultrasound. A Masson-type incision was made, noting an enlarged pyogenic gallbladder with thickened walls, sub-hepatic abscess of approximately 300 ml, greenish-yellow color, and fetid. An anterograde subtotal cholecystectomy is performed due to difficulty in identifying elements of <b>Calot</b> <b>triangle</b> due to the inflammatory process, opening it and extracting stones. The right iliac fossa is reviewed, finding a plastron and a sub-serous retrocaecal appendix perforated in its middle third with free fecalith and an abscess in the pelvic cavity. An anterograde appendectomy was performed and the patient progressed satisfactorily, later being discharged due to improvement. DiscussionIn this patient, with a history of recurrent episodes of gallbladder pain and disseminated acute abdominal pain without peritoneal irritation, clinical suspicion was exacerbated cholecystitis with probable empyema of the gallbladder.

40|$|Abstract Introduction: We report our {{experience}} and learning curve in single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SPLC) using an internal anchored retraction system. Methods: Usefulness of the retraction system was analysed in 18 SPLC. The first eight, the following ten SPLC and 20 consecutive four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomies (4 PLC) were compared. Duration of operation, burns on nontarget tissue and gallbladder perforations were assessed by reviewing videotapes recorded during the procedures. Results: Use of the retraction system failed in {{three out of}} five patients (60 %) with intraoperative signs of chronic inflammation and in one out of 13 (7. 1 %) without such signs (p = 0. 0441). Median operation time was 90 (45 - 120) in the first eight and 55 (40 - 180) minutes in the following ten SPLC (p = 0. 0361). Whereas the first eight SPLC lasted longer compared to 4 PLC (70 (40 - 140) minutes, p = 0. 0435) the difference disappeared after eight procedures (p = 0. 2076). Median number of burns to nontarget tissue was seven (1 - 16) in the first eight and one (0 - 8) in the following ten SPLC (p = 0. 0049).

40|$|Backgrounds/Aims: When {{surgeons}} face {{difficulties in}} dissecting the <b>Calot</b> <b>triangle</b> during cholecystectomy due to se-vere inflammation or fibrosis, the proximal {{portion of the}} gallbladder is left in place to avoid injury to the bile duct; this procedure is called partial cholecystectomy (PC), and it {{is associated with a}} much higher complication rate after the operation. Methods: We surveyed the clinical outcomes of 25 cases of PC by laparotomy during ten years from January 1998 to December 2007, for a total of 95 months of the mean follow-up period. Patients were separated in two groups for comparison: group I (n= 15), in which cystic duct closure was tried from the intraluminal cystic ductal opening; and group II (n= 10), in which cystic ductal circumferential ligation was possible. Results: Bile fistula occurred in 4 cases of group I, while no fistula occurred in group II. Postoperative peritonitis was observed in 4 cases from group I, with 3 of them caused by leakage of bile when the cystic duct could not be properly managed by stitches or staples. One of these peritonitis cases was fatal, but no case in group II showed peritonitis postoperatively. Wound infection, retained stone, and reoperations were also more frequent in group I, in 4, 2, and 5 cases. The mortality was 3 in group I and 1 in group II.

40|$|Backgrounds/Aims: Partial {{cholecystectomy}} (PC) {{is often}} an inevitable operative procedure when <b>Calot</b> <b>triangle</b> is se-verely inflamed and fibrosed with conglomerated structures. We reviewed our clinical outcomes of PC to compare its feasibility with conventional total cholecystectomy (TC), especially for its possible application to laparoscopic procedure. Methods: From Aug. 2000 to July 2008, 20 cases of PC by laparotomy were performed, including converted cases during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Sixty-eight cases of TC by open method {{during the same period}} were compared in a mean follow-up period of 108 months. Results: Bile fistula was observed in 3 cases of PC; one case needed endoscopic biliary stent for management and a second case showed fistula that closed by supportive care in 2 months. The last patient died from peritonitis. No bile fistula was observed in PC. Morbidities were found in 9 cases of PC (45 %) and in 11 cases of TC (16. 2 %). Bile fistula (n= 3) and wound infection (n= 3) were prominent in the PC group, and wound infection (n= 7) in the TC group. Reoperations were necessary for 5 (25. 0 %) and 4 (5. 9 %) patients from PC and TC, respectively. Mortality occurred in 2 (2 / 10 10 %) and 4 cases (4 / 68 5. 9 %) of PC and TC, respectively. Two mortalities in each group resulted from direct extension of cholecystitis.

This study was to evaluate the value of blunt dissection in preventing bile duct injury (BDI) in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Methods: From 2003 to 2015, LC was performed on 21, 497 patients, 7470 males and 14, 027 females, age 50. 3 years (14 – 84 years). The <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle</b> was bluntly dissected and each duct in <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle</b> was identified before transecting the cystic duct. Results: Two hundred and thirty-nine patients (1. 1 %) were converted to open procedures.

40|$|BACKGROUND: External {{dissection}} of <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle</b> and the gallbladder {{associated with}} complete cholecystectomy {{is considered the}} gold standard technique to achieve a safe cholecystectomy. However, in severe acute or chronic cholecystitis, the laparoscopic application of this standard technique may be technically difficult, with {{an increased risk of}} bile duct injury, even {{in the hands of an}} experienced surgeon. METHODS: In a consecutive series of 552 cholecystectomies, 39 patients (7. 1 %) with difficult local conditions within <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle,</b> such as gangrenous cholecystitis (three patients), severe scleroatrophic cholecystitis with or without anomalous right hepatic duct (24 and 10 patients, respectively), or Mirizzi syndrome (seven patients), underwent a routine exclusive "endovesicular approach" as an alternative to dissection of <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle</b> prior to further subtotal cholecystectomy. All patients were examined by control cholangiography 3 months postoperatively to confirm the safety of the technique. RESULTS: The operation was well tolerated by all patients with only 15. 4 % minor complications. Intraoperative cholangiography was feasible in 79. 5 %. There were no postoperative biliary or infectious complications. At 4. 3 months follow-up, all patients were symptom-free, except for two patients (5. 1 %) with residual common bile duct stones which were successfully treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy. CONCLUSIONS: An endovesicular approach for gallbladder dissection followed by subtotal cholecystectomy is a safe alternative to the classic Calot's dissection in the case of severe cholecystitis or difficult local conditions. This technique is recommended as an attractive solution to prevent bile duct injury, particularly when severe inflammation is associated to extrahepatic anatomic variants of the biliary tree...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the last}} decade, laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} has gained worldwide acceptance and {{considered to be}} as "gold standard" in the surgical management of symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. However, the incidence of bile duct injury in laparoscopic cholecystectomy is still two times greater compared to classic open surgery. The development of bile duct injury may result in biliary cirrhosis and increase in mortality rates. The mostly blamed causitive factor is the misidentification of the anatomy, especially by a surgeon {{who is at the}} beginning of his learning curve. Biliary tree injuries may be decreased by direct coloration of the cystic duct, ductus choledochus and even the gall bladder. Methods gall bladder fundus was punctured by Veress needle and all the bile was aspirated. The same amount of fifty percent methylene blue diluted by saline solution was injected into the gall bladder for coloration of biliary tree. The dissection of <b>Calot</b> <b>triangle</b> was much more safely performed after obtention of coloration of the gall bladder, cystic duct and choledocus. Results Between October 2003 and December 2004, overall 46 patients (of which 9 males) with a mean age of 47 (between 24 and 74) underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with methylene blue injection technique. The diagnosis of chronic cholecystitis (the thickness of the gall bladder wall was normal) confirmed by pre-operative abdominal ultrasonography in all patients. The diameters of the stones were greater than 1 centimeter in 32 patients and calcula of various sizes being smaller than 1 cm. were documented in 13 cases. One patient was operated for gall bladder polyp (our first case). Successful coloration of the gall bladder, cystic duct and ductus choledochus was possible in 43 patients, whereas only the gall bladder and proximal cystic duct were visualised in 3 cases. In these cases, ductus choledochus visibility was not possible. None of the patients developed bile duct injury. Conclusion The number of bile duct injuries related to anatomic misidentification can be decreased and even vanished by using intraoperative methylene blue injection technique into the gall bladder fundus intraoperatively. </p...|$|E

PRESENTATION OF CASEA 70 -year-old man complained of abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant with fever of 38 °C for two days. Abdominal ultrasound indicated acute cholecystitis and a single, extremely large gallstone (95 mm× 60 mm× 45 mm). Emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed successfully.

40|$|Celiac artery shows {{frequent}} {{variations in}} its branching pattern. Knowledge of its possible variations {{is useful in}} gastric, pancreatic and hepato-biliary surgeries. During our dissection classes, we observed a rare variation of the branching pattern of celiac trunk. It divided normally into its three branches; left gastric, splenic and common hepatic arteries. Left gastric and splenic arteries were normal in their course and distribution. The common hepatic artery trifurcated to give hepatic artery proper, gastroduodenal artery and an additional right hepatic artery. The branching pattern of hepatic artery proper and gastroduodenal arteries was normal. The additional right hepatic artery gave origin to a right gastric artery and a large pancreatic branch {{to the head of}} the pancreas.

40|$|Introduction: Laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently performed procedures in surgical wards. Proper anatomical identification of structures within the <b>triangle</b> of <b>Calot</b> is essential for the procedure safety. Aim: To evaluate demographic, clinical and anatomical characteristics of 84 patients who underwent laparoscopiccholecystectomies. Material and methods: Anatomical characteristics of <b>Calot’s</b> <b>triangle</b> were correlated with body mass index, genderand age of patients as well as with time of the surgery, type of vascular ligation, presence of adhesions, postoperativebleeding, bile leakage and use of a harmonic scalpel. Additionally, patients’ demographic data were analysed andcompared with data from other patients from Lublin’s state.

40|$|Anatomical {{variations}} of the cystic duct are well-defined. The presence of short or absent cystic duct is unusual and represents a co-factor of biliary injury especially during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Thus, its knowledge is important to avoid ductal injury in hepato-biliary surgery. We experienced {{the case of a}} 40 -year-old woman with symptomatic cholelitiasis, who underwent to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. At surgery, an accidental bile duct lesion was carried, during <b>Calot’s</b> <b>triangle</b> dissection, due the particular difficulties in dissecting an extremely short cystic duct found at the junction of the common hepatic duct and common bile duct. No vascular anomalies were present. The biliary leakage from the common bile duct was intraoperative identified and subsequentially treated by the endoscopic method. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with sequential biliary endoprosthesis insertion was completed without conversion to open surgery. The endoscopic stenting was the definitive treatment for the leakage. No evidence of biliary stent complication was observed during the follow-up.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new simple and easy technique called the "Hook and roll technique" (HRT) that uses an articulating hook cautery {{to provide a}} critical view during single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC). A 2 -cm incision is made at the umbilicus to insert three 5 -mm trocars or a multichannel port. After dissection of the serosa of the dorsal and ventral sides of the gall bladder, including <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle,</b> the angled tip of the hook cautery is inserted between the cystic artery and duct with its tip placed dorsally. The tip is then rotated in a clockwise manner to avoid bile duct injury, allowing the connective tissue between them to be hooked, coagulated and cut. This procedure is repeated several times, followed by dissection between the cystic artery and the liver bed to achieve a critical view. From December 2008 to May 2011, 121 patients underwent SILC using HRT in our hospital without any serious complications. This technique is suitable for SILC, as it is consists of simple procedures that can be performed safely and easily, even by left hand in a cross-over approach, and it allows complete dissection of <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle</b> to achieve a critical view without using any dissector under dangerous in-line viewing...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, SILS (single {{incision}} laparoscopic surgery) is being utilized increasingly in various procedures; single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) {{is the most common}} one of these procedures [1, 2]. One of the fundamental step in laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to visualize <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle</b> to obtain the critical view described by Strasberg et al. 1995 [3]. This can be easily done in the conventional 4 ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy using the ancillary ports. However, in order to minimize the number of ports, there are few methods available for gall bladder (GB) retraction in SILC that can substitute the usage of ancillary ports imitating retraction from conventional technique, e. g. trans-parietal stitch [4, 5], mini-loop retractor [6], a Kirschner wire [7]. We applied the transparietal stitch in our previous paper [8], but we had to introduce it in the last intercostal space to avoid lung injury and that may lead to pneumothorax. However, the disadvantage of this method is that the gall bladder is retracted perpen-dicular instead of cephalad direction and making some degree of masking of the <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle</b> and in some patients.

40|$|Bile duct injury (BDI) during laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} {{remains a}} serious iatrogenic surgical complication.

Respondents voted for a Delphi process and graded each item on a five-point scale. The consensus was built when 80 % of overall responses were 4 or 5. Response rates for the first- and second-round Delphi were 60. 6 % and 74. 9 %, respectively. Misidentification of local anatomy accounted for 76. 2 % of BDI. Final consensus was reached on: (1) Effective retraction of the gallbladder, (2) Always obtaining critical view of safety, and (3) Avoiding excessive use of electrocautery/clipping as vital procedures; and (4) <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle</b> area and (5) Critical view of safety as important landmarks. For (6) Impacted gallstone and (7) Severe fibrosis/scarring in <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle,</b> bail-out procedures may be indicated.

40|$|Laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} (LC) {{does not}} require advanced techniques, and its performance has therefore rapidly spread worldwide. However, the rate of biliary injuries has not decreased. The concept of the critical view of safety (CVS) was first documented two decades ago. Unexpected injuries are principally due to misidentification of human factors. The surgeon's assumption is {{a major cause of}} misidentification, and a high level of experience alone is not sufficient for successful LC. We herein describe tips and pitfalls of LC in detail and discuss various technical considerations. Finally, based on a review of important papers and our own experience, we summarize the following mandatory protocol for safe LC: (1) consideration that a high level of experience alone is not enough; (2) recognition of the plateau involving the common hepatic duct and hepatic hilum; (3) blunt dissection until CVS exposure; (4) <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle</b> clearance in the overhead view; (5) <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle</b> clearance in the view from underneath; (6) dissection of the posterior right side of Calot's triangle; (7) removal of the gallbladder body; and (8) positive CVS exposure. We believe that adherence to this protocol will ensure successful and beneficial LC worldwide, even in patients with inflammatory changes and rare anatomies...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the cystic lymph node in <b>triangle</b> of <b>Calot’s</b> and {{to detect the}} association of cystic artery to cystic lymph node at tertiary care teaching hospital Patients and Methods: This cross sectional case series study was conducted from 1 -July- 2015 to 31 -Dec- 2015 at LUMHS Jamshoro Sindh Pakistan. All the patients who were planned for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were admitted and included in this study. The referral patients from different wards as Gynecology & Obstetrics and medicine were {{also included in the}} study. All the participants were evaluated by ultrasound before surgical procedure while laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed under general anesthesia by applying four port techniques. The data was analyzed in SPSS 16, the frequency and percentages were computed for categorical variables while the mean ±SD was computed for quantitative variables. Results: The frequencies of the cystic lymph node and associated variations were observed. Of fifty cases 27 (54 %) cases had <b>Calot’s</b> <b>triangle</b> lymph nodes with female population predominance 20 (40 %). Out of 27 subjects, the cystic artery was posterioinferior and anteroinferior to lymph node in 18 (36 %) and 09 (18 %) individuals within <b>triangle</b> of <b>Calot’s.</b> Conclusion: The cystic lymph node was observed in twenty seven participants with association to cystic artery.

40|$|Situs inversus totalis {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} anomaly characterized by transposition of organs to the opposite site of the body. Diagnosis and treatment of cholelithiasis in such cases pose a challenge to operating surgeon because of atypical clinical picture and due to the contra lateral disposition of the visceral organs. No doubt, laparoscopic cholecystectomy in these patients is technically more demanding still it is feasible and should be done by trained and experienced laparoscopic surgeon.

40|$|Introduction. Laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} {{has become}} {{the gold standard for}} symptomatic cholelithiasis 1. Traditionally done through four ports, three and two port surgeries have been described. We present a novel technique of single port cholecystectomy using the R-PortR (Advanced Surgical Concepts). Materials and methods. The R-PortR is a Tri-port that allows the ingress of three 5 mm instruments through a single port. Twenty patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis were subjected to single port cholecystectomy using the R-PortR through the umbilicus. Two patients also had choledocholithiasis. Modified instruments with angulated shafts were used for the surgery. A telescope with a coaxial light cable was also used. Whenever necessary, an extra needle for retraction or an additional 5 mm port was used. Results. Single port laparoscopic was accomplished in 17 of the 20 patients. In one patient an additional port was used for the cholecystectomy and in two others it was used for the common bile duct exploration but not for the dissection of <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle.</b> Of the 17 patients, seven needed a single needle to retract the fundus of the gall bladder. Conclusions. Single port laparoscopic cholecystectomy is feasible and safe using the R-Port. The level of difficulty is higher and a needle for retraction or an additional port may be used whenever the visualization of <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle</b> is unsatisfactory. Further studies and the development of better instrumentation are necessary before this can be recommended as a standard procedure...|$|R
50|$|During {{the days}} prior to laparoscopic surgery, studies showed that {{outcomes}} were better following early removal of the gallbladder, preferably within the first week. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 7 days of visiting a doctor with symptoms) as compared to delayed treatment (more than 6 weeks) may result in shorter hospital stays and a decreased risk of requiring an emergency procedure. There is no {{difference in terms of}} negative outcomes including bile duct injury or conversion to open cholecystectomy. For early cholecystectomy, the most common reason for conversion to open surgery is inflammation that hides <b>Calot's</b> <b>triangle.</b> For delayed surgery, the most common reason was fibrotic adhesions.|$|R
40|$|The cystic artery {{is the key}} {{structure}} {{sought to}} be clipped or ligated during laparoscopic or conventional cholecystectomy. The possible complications like hemorrhage or hepatobiliary injury are always centered on the search, dissection, and clipping or ligation of the cystic artery, many a time because of possibility of variations in its course and relations to the biliary ducts. This descriptive study was carried out to document the normal anatomy and different variations of the cystic artery to contribute to improve surgical safety. This study conducted on 82 cadavers revealed cystic artery with mean length of 16. 9 [*]mm (ranged between 2 [*]mm and 55 [*]mm) and mean diameter of 1. 6 [*]mm (range between 1 [*]mm and 5 [*]mm). The origin of cystic artery from celiac right hepatic artery was found in 79. 3 % and in the remaining 20. 7 % it was replaced. Single cystic artery was present in 72 % and double cystic artery in 28 %. Considering the site of origin of the cystic artery with reference to <b>Calot’s</b> <b>triangle,</b> it was observed within the triangle in 62. 2 % and outside it in 37. 8 %. All the cystic arteries passed through <b>Calot’s</b> <b>triangle</b> except for 3. 6 %. The cystic artery crossed the common hepatic duct anteriorly in 26. 8 % and posteriorly in 6. 1 %. It crossed common bile duct anteriorly in 1. 2 % and posteriorly in 3. 7 %. The knowledge of such variations and its awareness will decrease morbidity and help to keep away {{from a number of}} surgical complications during cholecystectomy...|$|R
