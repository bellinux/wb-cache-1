His machine could produce between 150 and 700 pairs of shoes a day, <b>cutting</b> <b>shoe</b> prices across the nation in half. He sacrificed his health working exhausting hours on his invention and not eating {{over long periods of}} time, he caught a cold which quickly developed into tuberculosis. His early death in Lynn, Massachusetts from tuberculosis meant he never saw the full profit of his invention. He died on August 24, 1889, three weeks shy of his 37th birthday.|$|E
50|$|A caisson is sunk by self-weight, {{concrete}} {{or water}} ballast placed on top, or by hydraulic jacks. The leading edge (or <b>cutting</b> <b>shoe)</b> of the caisson is sloped {{out at a}} sharp angle to aid sinking in a vertical manner; it is usually made of steel. The shoe is generally wider than the caisson to reduce friction, and the leading edge may be supplied with pressurised bentonite slurry, which swells in water, stabilizing settlement by filling depressions and voids. An open caisson may fill with water during sinking. The material is excavated by clamshell excavator bucket on crane.|$|E

5000|$|The {{works for}} the bridge at either river bank were of brick, masonry and {{concrete}} on 13 in square pitch pine piles. The remainder of the bridge foundations consisted of cast iron piers fitted with <b>cutting</b> <b>shoes</b> sunk by excavation by hand labour working in airlocks, and by weighting. Piers for the swing span consisted of eight cast iron cylinders tapering from 6 to 4.5 ft diameter from base to top which surrounded a ninth cylinder of 7 ft base diameter; the [...] wall width cylinders were sunk {{to the level of}} sandstone bedrock at a depth of around 78 ft; after which they were filled with concrete. The central river pier had similar foundations of two 8 ft cast iron piers braced together. The swing span turntable consisted of 29 ft diameter steel conical roller paths and bearings, supported on a circular 20 in deep box girder in eight sections, with a twelve section box girder above, supporting the superstructure. The bridge turned about a central heavy cast pivot, with ties to the upper and lower box girders, and to the bearings. The bridge superstructure was constructed of wrought iron plate girders, with an asymmetric 'hogback' shape; the swing span extremities were 45 and 85 ft from the centre line, with a 92.45 LT counterweight; the maximum web depth was 14.5 ft. The fixed span was of similar, but symmetrical construction. The bridge was turned by the reaction of a rotating vertical shaft on a rack on the lower roller path. Power was supplied hydraulically from an accumulator (charged by steam engine power) near the railway station, via underground concentric pressure and return pipes in the central swing span pier - driving a pair of three cylinder hydraulic engines located in the cabin. Accumulators and steam engines were duplicated. The locking mechanism for the bridge was also hydraulically powered. As a consequence of the realignment of track resulting from the resiting of the bridge the station at Selby was also partially reconstructed.|$|R
40|$|The basic {{objective}} of a self‐boring pressuremeter (SBPM) test is to insert a cylindrical probe {{into the ground}} with a minimum of disturbance and expand the membrane covering the probe so as to load the soil to failure. The test data from the expansion phase allows the determination of lateral earth pressure, shear strength, stress‐strain behavior, and, in some cases, coefficient of consolidation. In spite of its considerable potential, as more investigators have utilized the SBPM, inconsistencies {{have been reported in the}} test results. To help resolve some of the uncertainties, 32 SBPM tests were conducted in soft San Francisco Bay Mud wherein key parameters were varied one at a time to isolate their influence. The parameters considered included: expansion rate, cutter position, cutting rate, and <b>cutting</b> <b>shoe</b> dimension. Furthermore, a microcomputer data acquisition system and loading technique were developed that allowed the test to be carried out automatically while recording a high density of data. The results of this study indicate that disturbance is the factor that has the greatest influence on the interpreted results from the SBPM test...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of the self-boring pressuremeter (SPBM) test are to measure, in situ, the horizontal stress and the stress–strain characteristics of soils and soft rocks. This cylindrical probe tunnels itself into {{the ground with a}} minimum disturbance. Conventionally, the advance has been performed using a cutter system housed inside a <b>cutting</b> <b>shoe.</b> Although proven effective, this method is slow and cumbersome. In response to these drawbacks, a jetting insertion method was introduced and designed to allow a faster rate of insertion using a system that is less equipment intensive and easily adapted to conventional drill rigs. To avoid similar potential inconsistencies encountered in earlier SBPM testing with the cutting method, a series of laboratory simulation tests and in situ self-boring pressuremeter tests were carried out in two soft clay deposits to assess the jetting method. The following key insertion parameters were studied: jetting nozzle type, drilling fluid velocity, jetting nozzle position, rate of advance, and jetting flushing system. The results of this study indicate that, as with the cutting method, the jetting method can be used in soft to medium clays to advance the self-boring pressuremeter with minimum disturbance.

The economic exploitation of children has generated an expanding set ofinternational legal standards designed {{to protect children from}} the harmful anddangerous effects of child labor. These standards, although well established,have suffered from many of the same practical weaknesses that have limitedthe effectiveness of international human rights law generally. This dilemma -strong legal norms but weak enforcement mechanisms - has contributed to arecent rise in private action to prevent child labor. These private initiativesutilize the standards embedded in international law and may, in turn, contributeto an evolution that will ultimately transform principles into effective,enforceable, legal norms...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{investigates the}} {{possibilities}} for performance improvements of synchronous machines with unidirectional application. The literature review part presents theories and applications of asymmetrical machine. Four categories regarding asymmetrical machine, namely mixed pole, saturation mitigation, pole shifting and asymmetrical pole shaping, are summarized. It is shown that asymmetrical concept offers characteristic improvement in one or both rotational directions. A field winding synchronous model was used in FEM simulation (FLUX 2 D). Armature reaction effecton this machine is investigated. It is found that armature reaction has different effects with varying current angle. Two ideas regarding asymmetrical pole shaping are investigated. First of all, pole <b>shoe</b> <b>cutting</b> idea is investigated. It leads to increased airgap length and less output torque. Secondly, progressive airgap idea shows reduced armature reaction effect and improved power factor, but higher torque ripple. Furthermore, an improved idea is suggested to reduce the torque ripple. Performance improvement by assisted permanent magnet is also studied. Four ideas of this field are investigated. It is found that permanent magnet {{can be used to}} reduce saturation, improve power factor and output torque. The reasons for limited improvements are analyzed...|$|R
40|$|A more efficient, {{cost-effective}} {{and timely}} way of designing and manufacturing custom footware is needed. A potential {{solution to this}} problem lies in the use of computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) techniques in the production of custom shoes. A prototype computer-based system was developed, and the system is primarily a software entity which directs and controls a 3 -D scanner, a lathe or milling machine, and a pattern-cutting machine to produce the shoe last and the components to be assembled into a shoe. The steps in this process are: (1) scan the surface of the foot to obtain a 3 -D image; (2) thin the foot surface data and create a tiled wire model of the foot; (3) interactively modify the wire model of the foot to produce a model of the shoe last; (4) machine the last; (5) scan the surface of the last and verify that it correctly represents the last model; (6) design <b>cutting</b> patterns for <b>shoe</b> uppers; (7) cut uppers; (8) machine an inverse mold for the shoe innersole/sole combination; (9) mold the innersole/sole; and (10) assemble the shoe. For all its capabilities, this system still requires the direction and assistance of skilled operators, and shoemakers to assemble the shoes. Currently, the system is running on a SUN 3 / 260 workstation with TAAC application accelerator. The software elements of the system are written in either Fortran or C and run under a UNIX operator system...|$|R
40|$|The optimum {{cutting of}} {{various parts of}} a shoe, prior to shoe {{manufacture}} requires knowledge of the topographical variation of what are termed “lines of tightness”. Currently the <b>cutting</b> operation for <b>shoe</b> parts is guided by a general assumption about {{the pattern of the}} lines of tightness. There is a need to have available a system which can determine, in a non-destructive way, the lines of tightness in an indvidual piece of leather. Initially an image analysis system was developed to investigate the uni-axial deformation behaviour of leather. This technique provided more information about the stress-strain behaviour of a leather sample along the gauge length than a conventional mechanical test and it was possible to accurately measure the strain distribution along the gauge length. A system was developed which could determine the relative displacement of marked spots along the gauge length of the sample using images captured during a uni-axial, bi-axial or multi-axial tensile test. The separation of the marked spots along the direction of applied stroke allowed the determination of longitudinal strain while contraction across the width was also measured in some cases, which was useful in calculating the Poisson’s ratio of leather for which a great variation was observed between different locations (Butt, Belly, Neck etc). Various approaches were investigated to determine the lines of tightness. Firstly, the local Poisson’s ratio was observed since a higher value of this parameter was associated with these lines of tightness. Secondly, biaxial stretching of leather by a series of actuators for each axis indicated the lines of tightness along the actuator with lower strain values. Thirdly, the strain was measured when the leather was stretched along number of known axes. This latter technique appeared to be the best approach and mathematical modeling was investigated to provide further refinement. A mechatronics-based device by industrial application of the third approach was also proposed. The software was written using a graphical programming system (LabVJ EW) ...|$|R
