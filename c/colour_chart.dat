40|$|Abstract Background A {{variety of}} {{techniques}} {{are used to}} study the colours of animal signals, {{including the use of}} visual matching to <b>colour</b> <b>charts.</b> This paper aims to highlight why they are generally an unsatisfactory tool for the measurement and classification of animal colours and why colour codes based on HTML (really RGB) standards, as advocated in a recent paper, are particularly inappropriate. There are many theoretical arguments against the use of <b>colour</b> <b>charts,</b> not least that human colour vision differs markedly from that of most other animals. However, the focus of this paper is the concern that, even when applied to humans, there is no simple 1 : 1 mapping from an RGB colour space to the perceived <b>colours</b> in a <b>chart</b> (the results are both printer- and illumination-dependent). We support our criticisms with data from colour matching experiments with humans, involving self-made, printed <b>colour</b> <b>charts.</b> Results <b>Colour</b> matching experiments with printed charts involving 11 subjects showed that the choices made by individuals were significantly different between charts that had exactly the same RGB values, but were produced from different printers. Furthermore, individual matches tended to vary under different lighting conditions. Spectrophotometry of the <b>colour</b> <b>charts</b> showed that the reflectance spectra of the charts varied greatly between printers and that equal steps in RGB space were often far from equal in terms of reflectance on the printed charts. Conclusion In addition to outlining theoretical criticisms of the use of <b>colour</b> <b>charts,</b> our empirical results show that: individuals vary in their perception of colours, that different printers produce strikingly different results when reproducing what should be the same chart, and that the characteristics of the light irradiating the surface do affect colour perception. Therefore, we urge great caution in the use of <b>colour</b> <b>charts</b> to study animal colour signals. They should be used {{only as a last resort}} and in full knowledge of their limitations, with specially produced charts made to high industry standards. </p...|$|R

40|$|To {{maintain}} {{the health of}} the Belizean barrier reef through economic growth, Watershed Reef Interconnectlvity Scientific Study (WRIScS) have been investigating the application of satellite colour imagery for water quality monitoring. Waters in the region are optically shallow (< 25 m) in that seabed colouration influences water colour. Before water quality information can be gained, seabed optical properties need to be identified for satellite colour validation. Typical instrumentation (e. g. reflectance radiometer) used in seabed ground truthing are prohibitively expensive for developing countries as Belize. In conjunction with WRIScS, this study investigated the application of Munsell <b>colour</b> <b>charts</b> and underwater digital photography as alternative low-cost approaches, during a ground truthing program of the Belizean coast. Munsell <b>colour</b> <b>charts</b> were matched to seabed colour and their reflectance information gained from a database. Reflectance information was derived from seabed digital imagery by the ratio of seabed RGB pixel values to pixel values of a white surface, photographed on the seabed. A compact digital camera was used in the study. Data of each approach was evaluated against reflectance radiometer data, collected during the program. Study finding showed consistent correlation of radiometer and Munsell data. Although accuracy decreased slightly with an increase in wavelength, believed to be linked to greater light penetration of shorter wavelengths. Consequently, a cautious approach is recommended in the use of Munsell values for red light. The approach was concluded reliable, though best suited to measuring sediment colour than other mediums. Light values measured from digital imagery varied significantly within an image and were inconsistent with image depth, casting doubt in data validity. In addition, correlation of digital data was found subjective. A laboratory study found probable cause of the chromatic aberrations to be camera autoexposure and white balance functions, and their degree of influence dependent upon prevailing conditions and subject matter, therefore unpredictable. The study concluded, at current, the potential of this grade of digital camera in underwater studies is limited. WATERSHED REEF INTERCONNECTIVITY SCIENTIFIC STUDY (WRISCS) BELAMA, BELIZE C.

50|$|As {{early as}} 1966, Richter had made {{paintings}} based on <b>colour</b> <b>charts,</b> using the rectangles of colour as found objects in an apparently limitless variety of hue; these culminated in 1973-4 {{in a series}} of large-format pictures such as 256 Colours. Richter painted three series of Color Chart paintings between 1966 and 1974, each series growing more ambitious in their attempt to create through their purely arbitrary arrangement of colors. The artist began his investigations into the complex permutations of color charts in 1966, with a small painting entitled 10 Colors. The charts provided anonymous and impersonal source material, a way for Richter to disassociate color from any traditional, descriptive, symbolic or expressive end. When he began to make these paintings, Richter had his friend Blinky Palermo randomly call out colors, which Richter then adopted for his work. Chance thus plays its role in the creation of his first series.|$|R

30|$|In a {{study of}} {{multispectral}} and hyperspectral reflectance imaging, a Round Robin Test assessed the performance of different systems for the spectral digitisation of artworks. A Russian icon, mass-produced in Moscow in 1899, was digitised by ten institutions around Europe. The image quality was assessed by observers, and the reflectance spectra at selected points were reconstructed to characterise the icon’s colourants and to obtain a quantitative estimate of accuracy. The differing spatial resolutions of the systems affected their ability to resolve fine details in the printed pattern. There was a surprisingly wide variation {{in the quality of}} imagery, caused by unwanted reflections from both glossy painted and metallic gold areas of the icon’s surface. Specular reflection also degraded the accuracy of the reconstructed reflectance spectrum in some places, indicating the importance of control over the illumination geometry.
