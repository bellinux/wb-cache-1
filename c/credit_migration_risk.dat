It {{is focused on}} assumptions, calculation methods, results and specifics of the CreditMetrics and the CreditRisk+ models. The CreditRisk+ model analytically determines the portfolio credit losses distribution that is caused by defaults of counterparties. In the CreditMetrics model, the <b>credit</b> <b>migration</b> <b>risk</b> is addition- ally considered and the future portfolio value distribution is calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation. The third approach covered in this thesis is the Solvency II, the set of requirements proposed by the European Union for determination of regulatory capital for insurance companies. In the practical part the three ap- proaches are applied {{on a set of}} three portfolios of different credit quality.

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} credit quality {{transition}} matrices of loans to Italian firms changed during a cyclical downturn (2008 - 09), {{compared with a}} previous time of growth (2006 - 07). Once transition matrices were linked to interest rates, banks {{appear to have been}} remarkably able at calibrating required risk premiums to actual idiosyncratic risk, both during expansion and recession. However, the uncertainty generated by the crisis accentuated the unexpected component of credit worsening, thus lowering pricing effectiveness. The main finding is that larger banking groups were more affected by the sudden deterioration of credit quality than smaller ones, as far as ability to price risk is concerned. The bank-size effect can be tackled through an efficient use of hard or soft information: both rating users and decentralized banks showed an above-average ability in calibrating rates to risk during the crisis; banks with a stronger relationship with borrowers smoothed the risk-price curve in normal times. banking, crisis, <b>credit</b> <b>migration,</b> <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> pricing...|$|R

The Markov chain models are found to produce more accurate, reliable transition probability rates using the 3 x 1 migration measurement method used by farm lenders. Compared to corporate bond ratings migration results, this study obtained larger mean differences in singular value decomposition between the cohort matrix {{and each of the}} Markov chain matrices. This finding suggests that the omission of transient, indirect migration activities under the cohort method is more costly when applied to farm credit analysis. This discrepancy could lead to understated transition probability estimates which, in turn, could produce misleading indicators of farm loan portfolio quality.

40|$|The costly {{lessons from}} global {{crisis in the}} past decade {{reinforce}} the importance as well as challenges of risk management. This thesis explores several core concepts of quantitative risk management and provides further insight. We start with rating <b>migration</b> <b>risk</b> and propose a Mixture of Markov Chains (MMC) model to account for stochastic business cycle effects in <b>credit</b> rating <b>migration</b> <b>risk.</b> The model shows superior in-sample estimation and out-of-sample predication than its rivals. Compared with the naive approach the economic application suggests banks with MMC estimator will increase capital requirement in economic expansion and free up capital during recession hence it is aligned with Basel III macroprudential imitative by reducing the recession-vs-expansion gap in capital buffers. Subsequently we move to the key concept of dependence by investigating the importance of dynamic linkages between credit and equity markets. We propose a flexible regime-switching copula model to explore the dynamics of dependence and possible structure breaks with special consideration on tail dependence. The study reveals a high-dependence regime that coincides with the recent financial crisis. The backtesting results acknowledge the new model's superiority on out-of-sample VaR forecasting over purely dynamic or static copula. It can serve to emphasise the relevance for risk management of appropriately modeling complex dependence structures. Finally we discuss the risk measures and how they affect the portfolio optimisation. We contend that more successful portfolio management can be achieved by combining extreme value analysis to describe downside tail risk and dynamic copulas to model nonlinear dependence structures. Conditional Value-at-Risk is adopted as pertinent measure of downside tail risk for portfolio optimisation. Using both realised portfolio returns and a set of out-of-sample Monte Carlo experiments, our novel portfolio strategy is confronted with the de facto mean-variance approach. The results suggest that the MV approach produces suboptimal portfolios or a less desirable risk-return tradeoff...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} finite-sample {{behaviour}} of sovereign <b>credit</b> <b>migration</b> estimators and an-alyzes {{the properties of}} the rating process. Through bootstrap simulations, we compare a discrete multinomial estimator and two continuous hazard rate methods which differ in that one neglects time heterogeneity in the rating process whereas the other accounts for it. The study is based on Moody’s rat-ings 1981 - 2004 for 72 industrialized and emerging economies. Hazard rate estimators yield more accurate default probabilities. The time homogeneity assumption leads to underestimating the default probabil-ity and greater <b>migration</b> <b>risk</b> is inferred upon relaxing it.

40|$|In this paper, the {{treasury}} {{rates and the}} <b>credit</b> <b>migrations</b> are jointly modeled by multi-dimensional affine processes. In order to capture the entire information, including <b>credit</b> <b>migrations</b> and default events, we construct non-conservative regular affine processes to model <b>credit</b> <b>migrations</b> and characterize the default {{by the death of}} the processes. In particular, two specific cases: purely jump affine models and affine diffusion models with potentials, are discussed. This affine approach not only produces the explicit formulas for the prices of corporate bonds and other credit derivatives, but also directly incorporates the credit rating information as a parameter into the pricing formulas. Moreover, our affine models allow to consider the joint <b>credit</b> <b>migrations</b> within an analytically tractable framework in order to capture the correlations of credit movements between firms. Finally, the empirical testing results of a simple affine model are presented to support the effectiveness of our models. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>migration</b> or {{transition}} matrices, which {{characterize the}} expected changes in credit quality of obligors, are cardinal inputs to {{applications such as}} asset pricing and risk management.

This yields a metric which has an intuitively-appealing “size” related to the average probability of migration of the original matrix. We also propose a new mobility index performance criterion which is particularly relevant for <b>credit</b> <b>migration</b> matrices, namely that it be distribution discriminatory, i. e. sensitive to the distribution of off-diagonal probability mass. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed metric over more traditional cell-by-cell distance metrics and eigenvalue-based mobility indices.

We propose a factor probit model for modeling and prediction of credit rating matrices that are assumed to be stochastic and driven by a latent factor. The filtered latent factor path reveals the effect of the economic cycle on corporate credit ratings, and provides evidence in support of the PIT (point-in-time) rating philosophy. The factor probit model also yields the estimates of cross-sectional correlations in rating transitions that are documented empirically but not fully accounted for in the literature and in the regulatory rules established by the Basle Committee. <b>Credit</b> Rating, <b>Migration,</b> <b>Migration</b> Correlation, <b>Credit</b> <b>Risk,</b> Probit Model, Latent Factor, Business Cycle. ...|$|R

So Nelson-Siegel function can be used for this aim. Then the model for the time to default is described. It is based on the theory of random censorship.

They are also an integral part of many of the credit portfolio models used by financial institutions. By separating the economy into two states or regimes, expansion and contraction, and conditioning the migration matrix on these states, we show that the loss distribution of credit portfolios can differ greatly, as can the concomitant level of economic capital to be assigned.

The model is characterized by an underlying stochastic process that represents credit quality and default events are associated to barrier crossings. The stochastic process has state dependent volatility and jumps which are estimated by using empirical migration and default rates. A risk-neutralizing drift and forward liquidity spreads are estimated to consistently match the average spread curves corresponding to all the various ratings.

40|$|NB REWRITE THIS] Abstract: It {{is shown}} that credit basket {{derivatives}} such as CDOs which de-pend {{on a large}} numberM of firms (M ≥ 100 is typical in some contexts) can be modeled in a parsimonious and computationally efficient manner within the affine Markov chain (AMC) framework for multifirm <b>credit</b> <b>migration</b> in-troduced in a companion paper [Hurd and Kuznetsov (2006) ]. The proposed method {{has a number of}} merits. First, since our AMC models extend the in-tensity based doubly stochastic framework for multifirm default to a <b>credit</b> <b>migration</b> setting, they can be flexibly fit to observed market bond data for the individual constituent firms, and they can in principle explain the dynamics of this data. Second, the method handles some of the variations of CDOs such as nonhomogeneous hazard rates and unequal notational amounts that industry practitioners need to use. Thirdly, the approximation schemes we use can be verified in special cases, and prove to perform to basis point accuracy with typical parameter choices. Finally, in our model, prices and sensitivities for such derivatives are reduced to low dimensional integrals which can often be computed on a desktop computer in fractions of seconds. In this paper we de-velop an illustrative version of the modeling framework and present a number of sample CDO computations which illustrate the power of the method.

This thesis is an empirical investigation of various issues that arise {{in the analysis of}} <b>credit</b> rating <b>migration.</b> Using the unique and rich internal rating data of a Canadian SME loan portfolio, the thesis investigates <b>credit</b> rating <b>migration</b> from different perspectives.

The underlying assumptions of the three competing methods, time homogeneous first-order Markov chain, are then examined.

The forecasts are based on different estimation methods of migration matrices.

40|$|For {{a credit}} portfolio, {{we are often}} {{interested}} in modelling the migration of accounts between credit grades over time. For a large retail portfolio, data on <b>credit</b> grade <b>migration</b> may be available only {{in the form of}} a series of (typically monthly) population transition matrices representing the gross flow of accounts between each pair of credit grades in the given time period. The challenge is to model the transition process on the basis of these aggregate flow matrices. Each row of an observed transition matrix represents a sample from an ordinal probability distribution.
