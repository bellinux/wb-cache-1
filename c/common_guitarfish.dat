50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>guitarfish</b> {{is found}} in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from the {{southern}} end of the Bay of Biscay to Angola, including the Mediterranean Sea. It cruises slowly around just above the seabed, sometimes resting on the sand or mud and semi-covering itself with sediment.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} remains of this fish are teeth and vertebra. A study {{performed}} on Myledaphus vertebra from Alberta in 2013 revealed that Myledaphus had an estimated maximum age of 16 years. This means that Myledaphus had a shorter lifespan {{than that of}} the modern <b>common</b> <b>guitarfish,</b> by a difference of 8 years.|$|E
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>guitarfish</b> {{can grow}} to {{a length of}} about 147 cm, but a more normal length is about 80 cm. The dorsal surface is khaki-brown and the underparts are white. It is very similar in {{appearance}} to the blackchin guitarfish (Rhinobatos cemiculus), which shares its distribution, but is generally smaller, has larger eyes, more widely separated rostral ridges, a longer front nasal lobe and a wider back nasal flap.|$|E
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>guitarfish</b> is a benthic fish, {{cruising}} {{along just}} above the sandy or muddy seabed and foraging for crustaceans, other invertebrates and fish. It is an ovoviviparous fish {{with one or two}} litters of live young being born each year, each litter being four to ten fish. The gestation period is about four months, and the young develop inside the female, obtaining nourishment from their yolk sacs at first, and later from uterine secretions of their mother.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>common</b> <b>guitarfish</b> (Rhinobatos rhinobatos) is {{a species}} of {{cartilaginous}} fish in the family Rhinobatidae. It is native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is a bottom-dwelling fish feeding on crustaceans, other invertebrates and fish. The females give birth to live young. Its lifestyle makes it vulnerable to trawling and other fishing methods, populations seem to be declining and it has disappeared from parts of its range. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being [...] "endangered".|$|E
50|$|The blackchin {{guitarfish}} is plain brown above and white below, {{and has a}} black blotch on its snout, more noticeable in juveniles than adult fish. It is similar in appearance to the <b>common</b> <b>guitarfish</b> (Rhinobatos rhinobatos) which is sympatric (shares the same range). Characteristic differences include the blackchin's smaller eyes, narrower rostral ridges (nearly united at the front), shorter front nasal lobe and narrower back nasal flap. Both species have short thorns present on the inner margins of the eye, on the shoulders and along the spine and tail, but these are less distinct in the blackchin. This species grows to a length of about 180 cm, although larger fish have been reported from Guinea in West Africa and the Gulf of Gabès in the southern Mediterranean.|$|E
5000|$|The blackchin {{guitarfish}} is a low-fecundity fish and mature individuals aggregate {{off the coast}} seasonally to deliver their young and mate. At this time, they are particularly vulnerable to fishing activity. This species is particularly valued for its fins which sell at a high price, but the fish are also used for food. They are caught by trawling and gillnets in artisanal fisheries and as bycatch during industrial shrimp fishing. Along with the <b>common</b> <b>guitarfish,</b> {{they used to be}} plentiful in the northern Mediterranean and around the Balearic Islands, but seem to no longer be present in these areas. Catches off the coast of Africa have declined also, but data on landings is in short supply. The International Union for Conservation of Nature is concerned about the future of this fish and has assessed its conservation status as being [...] "endangered".|$|E
5000|$|The <b>common</b> <b>guitarfish</b> lives {{close to}} the coast and breeds in shallow water. This makes it vulnerable, and it is fished, {{primarily}} as bycatch, over much of its range. In the northern Mediterranean, catches used to be landed, along with the blackchin guitarfish (Rhinobatos cemiculus), at fishing ports such as Palermo, but both fish are now no longer seen there and have probably been extirpated from the area. It is no longer {{to be seen in}} the Balearic Islands either. Off the coasts of West Africa, it is caught as bycatch by international shrimp trawling vessels, and by cephalopod fisheries trawling the seabed, as well as being caught by local artisanal gill net fishermen. Its meat may be salted and exported and its fins sold to Asia. It may be safest in the southern Mediterranean where the fishing is less intensive and it is still sometimes landed, but even there, most of the fish landed are immature. For the fish to have a long-term future and the fisheries to be sustainable, the adult fish need to be allowed to mature and breed. There is no special conservation plan for this fish and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being [...] "endangered".|$|E
40|$|Spermiogenesis and the ultrastructural {{characters}} of the spermatozoon of Echinobothrium euterpes are described by means of transmission electron microscopy, including cytochemical analysis for glycogen. Materials were obtained from a <b>common</b> <b>guitarfish</b> Rhinobatos rhinobatos caught in the Gulf of Gabès (Tunisia). Spermiogenesis in E. euterpes {{is characterized by the}} orthogonal development of two unequal flagella followed by the flagellar rotation and the proximodistal fusion of these flagella with the median cytoplasmic process. The most interesting pattern characterizing the diphyllidean cestodes is the presence of a triangular body constituted by fines and dense granules without visible striation and assimilated at the striated rootlets. This pattern, only related in the Diphyllidea cestodes may be a synapomorphy of this order. Spermiogenesis is also characterized by the presence of a very short flagellum (around 1 μm long), observed in all the stages of spermiogenesis. This type of flagellum has never been commented in the diphyllidean cestodes and should be considered as an evolved character in this group. In the latest stage of spermiogenesis, this short axoneme probably degenerates. Thus, the mature spermatozoon of E. euterpes possesses only one axoneme of 9 [*]+[*]' 1 ' trepaxonematan pattern. It also exhibits a single helical electron-dense crested body, a spiraled nucleus, few parallel cortical microtubules, and α-glycogen granules. Similitudes and differences between spermatozoa of diphyllideans are discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{focuses on}} the {{population}} biology of the <b>common</b> <b>guitarfish</b> Rhinobatos rhinobatos, a cartilaginousfish listed as Endangered in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Between December 2012 and January 2014, 67 individuals were collected by bottom longliningin coastal Lebanese marine waters at different ports at depths ranging from 10 to 110 m. The totallength (LT) of the specimens ranged from 50 to 143 cm, and the mean±s. d. was 76 ⋅ 2 ± 19 ⋅ 7 cm. Themost common LT classes were between 60 and 70 cm. The total mass of the specimens ranged from 410 to 10 000 g, and the mean±s. d. was 1841 ± 1987 g. A total of 34 males and 33 females werecollected, and the sex ratio was {{not significantly different from}} 1 : 1. The mass and LT relationshipshowed positive allometric growth (b= 3 ⋅ 096 and r 2 = 0 ⋅ 99), and the mean±s. d. LT at which 50 % ofthe individuals were sexually mature was 84 ⋅ 73 ± 5 ⋅ 81 cm for females and 78 ⋅ 57 ± 4 ⋅ 88 cm for males. The gonado-somatic and hepato-somatic indices were determined along with a condition factor, andparturition appeared to occur in winter. The primary prey items found in the fish stomachs during theautumn and winter seasons were Penaeidae. The results of this study will help to parameterize modelsof the population dynamics for this exploited fish stock to ensure the long-term sustainability of itsfishery...|$|E
