[...] In 1995, the Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "With its finely restored interior and turn-of-the-century architecture, old Fire Station 23 in Downtown Los Angeles {{is one of}} the choicest filming locations in town." [...] One producer called it [...] "a great raw architectural space that you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> with." ...|$|E

Coxon was a fan of the series and said [...] "If I'd been told a year ago that I would be playing SpongeBob today I would have loved it, {{although}} I'm not sure I would have believed it." [...] Coxon admitted it was difficult to adapt the show into a musical. He remarked [...] "It is difficult because you are trying to recreate this character that is so fluid on screen. For example I'm just getting used to my square costume, although it does have an incredible design, so that, although I am restricted, I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the things he does in the cartoon." ...|$|E
500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} Tanner Gill {{explained that}} the hotel in which the climactic fighting takes place was designed specifically with the fights in mind, saying [...] "The basic environment of the fight had to be constructed to be “stunt friendly.” The space was tailored. Each corner was rounded; surfaces were measured for height and size, then padded." [...] Elaborating on this, fight choreographer Matt Mullins stated, [...] "The main fight starts in a hallway, and then we move into a penthouse. Okay, we have a hallway and a penthouse—what can we do with that? Are we going to crash into some walls? Are we {{going to go into}} a kitchen? We see what we would get in terms of props, we take into consideration what the actors can do, move-wise—in our case, Ming-Na is exceptionally talented, so we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of different martial arts movement with her." ...|$|E

500|$|Right away, Jackson {{noticed that}} Springsteen {{was a very}} {{particular}} critic of his own concert sound. At every new venue, Springsteen would take [...] "BJ" [...] around to various seats in the concert venue, sitting in every section, even the last row of seats, {{and listen to the}} band play. He asked Jackson why the sound was not so good far away as it was up close, and if the audio crew could do anything about it. Jackson said, [...] "we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about it", and worked with Clair Brothers to design a ring of delay loudspeakers positioned closer to the farthest seats to augment the high frequencies lost over distance by sound waves travelling through air. This made the hi-hat sound more [...] "crisp and clean", with higher quality sound in the back row than previously experienced in such large venues. Throughout Jackson's years with him, Springsteen maintained his interest in delivering high quality sound to every seat, and the solutions grew in size and complexity until by 1984 there were eight rings of delays set up for the largest venues.|$|E
500|$|In the State Senate, Solis {{authored}} 17bills {{to prevent}} {{domestic violence and}} championed labor, education, and health care issues. She described herself as [...] "a big believer that government, if done right, <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{to improve the quality}} of people's lives". In 1995 she sponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.75; it was strongly opposed by business organizations and the restaurant industry. When Governor Pete Wilson vetoed it, she organized a successful drive to make the issue into a ballot initiative the next year, using $50,000 of her own campaign funds and rallying union support. The initiative's passing garnered her a statewide reputation and other states followed with similar initiatives. She chaired the labor committee and established herself as loyal to labor interests, but made a point of establishing relationships with Republicans on the committee. Solis held high-profile hearings on labor law enforcement following a summer 1995 sweatshop raid in El Monte that discovered more than 70 Thai workers existing in slave-like conditions. She called garment manufacturers to explain themselves and pushed for tougher enforcement of anti-sweatshop laws. Republican State Senator Ray Haynes later said that Solis was [...] "a committed liberal in the pockets of labor", but Republican State Senate Leader Rob Hurtt said of her, [...] "We obviously didn't see eye to eye. But she was respectful. I'll give her credit; she was a very hard worker and she knew her stuff." ...|$|E

Among the accusations were that workers {{were subjected to}} body searches and involuntary pregnancy tests. Bathrooms were locked and access tightly controlled. Employees were forced to work overtime and were paid sweatshop wages.

2500|$|The {{praise for}} the serial was not, however, universal. Writing for The Guardian newspaper, Philip Hensher criticised the program sight unseen.

My approach is to update it and make it feel modern and 2013. The pilot opens with a 4-5 minute sequence which I think is really harrowing and really dangerous, that would be something that you might have seen on Chicago Code or The Shield. I want it to feel grounded in that way. There'll be some opportunities for laughs after that. It's not a laughs come first show." ...|$|E

When generations overlap and the young must borrow to make educational investments, a dynamically-efficient welfare state, by taxing the middle-aged and offering a compensatory old-age pension, can generate higher long-run human capital and welfare compared to laissez faire. Along the transition, no generation is hurt and some are better off. If an intergenerational human capital externality is present, unfunded pensions can be gradually phased out entirely. Public pension reform can be rationalized on efficiency grounds without relying on political-economy concerns or aging...|$|R
2500|$|Thornography was {{released}} in October 2006. According to Dani Filth, the title [...] "represents mankind's obsession with sin and self... an addiction to self-punishment or something equally poisonous... a mania."

Thornography received a similar reception to Nymphetamine, garnering generally positive reviews, but raising a few eyebrows with the inclusion of a cover of Heaven 17's [...] "Temptation" [...] (featuring guest vocals from Dirty Harry), which {{was released}} as a digital single and accompanying video shortly before the album.
