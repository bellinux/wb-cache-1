50|$|Tank <b>container</b> <b>chassis,</b> also {{referred}} to as tank chassis, drop frame chassis or tank trailers, are a form of intermodal transportation for portable bulk liquid containers or ISO tank containers. They are characteristically longer and have lower deck height ideal for transporting constantly shifting payloads. The invention of the tank container revolutionized the way bulk liquids were transported, stored, and handled worldwide. It has improved safety, reduced costs and brought with it the benefits of convenience and efficiency associated with a multi-modal transport system. Invariably the invention of the drop frame chassis followed soon after to accommodate this new type of intermodal container.|$|E
50|$|Though in the USA tank {{containers}} {{are typically}} the same dimensions (20 * 8 * 8.5 ft). {{as a standard}} ISO ocean container, tank chassis are much longer than the typical 20 ft <b>container</b> <b>chassis.</b> Tank chassis typically measure 40 - 43 ft in length by 8 x 4 ft wide x tall. This chassis has a standard drop-frame design providing a lower center of gravity than conventional trailers and an overall length suitable to legally scale most tanks. Twistlocks provide a secure mounting mechanism for the tanks and {{eliminate the need for}} straps or chains. The lower center of gravity is crucial for reducing the chances of a roll over with the constant shifting weight of the liquid cargo. These chassis can also be fitted with additional accessories including: lift kits to facilitate product discharge, hose tubes, and hi/lo kits to carry two empty tanks.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ratio of}} <b>container</b> length to <b>chassis</b> length {{is a factor}} in {{achieving}} rated load capacity. This ratio determines the load angle, and all hooklift hoist systems indicate a recommended range of body lengths, typically 3 - 5 ft difference in length between the <b>container</b> and the <b>chassis.</b> <b>Container</b> bodies shorter than the recommended length produce substantially steeper load angles, and consequently lower load rating, than those of the longest bodies intended for use with a particular hoist.|$|R

30|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} {{previous research on}} the dynamics of global carrier alliances (Heaver et al., 2000; Panayides and Cullinane, 2002; Song and Panayides, 2002; Cariou, 2008; Panayides and Wiedmer; 2011; Lee and Song, 2016), alliance stability and efficiency (Midoro and Pitto, 2000), coordination mechanisms (Van der Horst and Van der Lugt, 2011), and information sharing. Port and terminal competition and cooperation strategies in response to alliance formation have been examined by Heaver et al., (2001); Song, (2003), and Lee and Lam, (2015). The role of port regionalization and competitiveness (Notteboom and Yap, 2012) in response to changing supply chain requirements {{as a result of}} carrier alliances points to the need for more sophisticated study of port-cluster connections (Lee and Song, 2016). While ocean carrier alliances have allowed carriers to rationalize resources and extend their reach on the major trade lanes, they have created operational challenges centered on port congestion, schedule reliability, and hinterland service integration (Franc and Van der Horst, 2010; Meng, 2016). This has been further exacerbated by a transition in U.S. ports from reliance on ocean carriers to provide <b>container</b> <b>chassis</b> to reliance on third parties to provide the chassis as is the norm {{in other parts of the}} world. Major ports and regulatory bodies in the U.S. have convened ‘task forces’ composed of industry experts to collaborate on solutions addressing port productivity and performance (NY/NJ Port Authority, 2015). At this writing there is concern regarding overcapacity that has led to a collapse in rates and cancellations of sailings by the major carriers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{analyzed}} static {{finite element}} of the <b>container</b> flooring and <b>chassis</b> combination structure rolling by a car; then, we analyzed the maximum deformation and corresponding maximum stress of the flooring and chassis combination when chassis crossbeam cross-sectional shape from the U-shaped to the I-shaped and compared with the original structure with the same force, {{as well as the}} space between the central crossbeam decreased, we can see that, the appropriate crossbeam space can obviously increase the stiffness of the container and reduce the stress of the structure; at the same time, we analyzed the combinations which with different flooring structures, we can see that the difference deformation between the new combination and the original was small, so we know that the mechanical properties of flooring had little effect to the mechanical properties of the entire combination...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} strategies, methodologies and tools for an optimal {{management}} of Reusable Transport Items, such as <b>containers</b> or <b>chassis,</b> in an extensive multi-depots network. We use an ocean shipping company operating globally {{to propose a}} broad, comprehensive and integrated system for an optimal management of the fleet, embracing technology, processes and monitoring system. The ability to track these assets {{is the first step}} to visibility and fleet optimization and we will question the opportunity for a company to invest in a real time tracking technology. In highly complex logistic networks, the challenge is to get the right equipment at {{the right place at the}} right time, in a cost efficient manner and with a fleet size as small as possible. Beyond increased visibility through tracking capabilities, we show that choosing an appropriate utilization metrics helps identify and quantify other areas of improvement. Using actual data, we evaluate to what extent the fleet size can be reduced by improving asset utilization and how leasing also impacts operating costs. We also show how the structural imbalance of trade (some regions being net exporters while others are net importers) impacts both global repositioning policy and local inventory policy, with depots of different profiles requiring different policies. Understanding this systematic and systemic approach of fleet management, we assess the contribution of tracking technology capabilities to these potential improvements. by Jean-Marie Lefebvre and Dameng Yue.

50|$|Many {{users have}} {{experienced}} {{problems with the}} SIM connecting to the network after using the phone for some time. Most {{of them had to}} bring the phone to the Nokia center to get their phone repaired or replaced. The cause seems to be a design problem in the SIM <b>container</b> on the <b>chassis</b> of the phone. The SIM container is mainly built of a thin metal foil, which in time tends to bend, thus disconnecting the SIM from the mobile phone's SIM contacts. The problem can apparently be solved just by putting a bit of paper between the metal foil and the SIM, enabling it to make contact.There's also difficulties in making connection to WLAN networks which use EAP-PEAP and MSchapV2 protocols if you update the phone's firmware (this is true as for firmware version 3.0633.69)Other users experience problems with the phone connecting to third party GPS devices over Bluetooth. This seems to be a compatibility flaw in the Nokia Bluetooth stack of Nokia Maps as these devices do connect well when used with Google Maps on the E65.|$|R
5000|$|Keith Walton Tantlinger (March 22, 1919 - August 27, 2011) was a {{mechanical}} engineer and inventor. As Vice President of Engineering at the Fruehauf Trailer Corporation his inventions {{played a major role}} in containerization. [...] Working with a Fruehauf customer, Malcom McLean, they spearheaded the container ship revolution in the 1950s, Tantlinger developed much of the early technology that made modern container shipping possible while at Fruehauf. After its initial order of containers from Brown Trailer, Sea-Land switched to containers made by the Strick division of the Fruehauf Trailer Company. Fruehauf had been one of the dominant players in building truck bodies and trailers for a long time, and, as already described, had previously innovated in the design and construction of the early commercial semi-trailers. President Roy Fruehauf was impressed with the idea of containerization, so in addition to manufacturing containers for Sea-Land his company agreed to make the trailer chassis that were needed, and also to provide financing to Sea-Land for the purchase of these <b>containers</b> and <b>chassis.</b> In 1958 Tantlinger left Sea-Land and became chief engineer at Fruehauf, where he continued to work with containers. More importantly, over the years he played a key role in the process of container standardization, working extensively on a committee of the American Standards Association (ASA) and later being critically involved with the ISO’s efforts. His designs included the corner casting and Twistlock systems found on every intermodal container, the spreader bar for automatic securing of containers lifted on and off ships, and the ship-shore container transfer apparatus for the first cellular container ship. In the course of his professional career, Tantlinger was granted 79 United States patents, all related to transportation equipment. Many of his patents related to commercial highway freight trailers and transit buses.|$|R
