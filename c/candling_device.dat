40|$|This paper proposes an {{integrated}} device control system called Control Architecture for Networked Devices in Location Environments (<b>CANDLE),</b> which controls <b>devices</b> with Google Maps. Google Maps provides a global map interface and flexible APIs. The main motivation {{for this study}} is to provide a search and control system for physically distributed devices using Google Maps. To achieve this, the requirements of the system are (1) to coordinate device information with map information on Google Maps and (2) all distributed information has to be integrated on one interface. Device information is a set of information to control devices on an interface of Google Maps. CANDLE is {{an integrated}} device control system using Google Maps designed to meet these requirements. Using CANDLE, a user can control physically distributed devices through a web browser. In <b>CANDLE,</b> all <b>device</b> information is integrated into one map. <b>CANDLE</b> enables <b>device</b> control, searches, and display of information on distributed devices on an interface of Google Maps through a web browser. By using a web browser, a user can control devices from anywhere even if the devices are distributed globally. Thus, CANDLE is quite useful for distributed device control systems such as security, healthcare, and global monitoring systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} salinity data {{of marine}} aerosols in a Brazilian coastal area at sites {{closer to the}} shore and discusses the influence of wind regime. Results show that measurements of marine salt deposition are strongly influenced by wind speeds above the critical value of 3. 0 m s− 1. Although {{there is no agreement}} in literature yet as to how much this threshold is, the level of 3. 0 m s− 1 is similar to the one found in a study carried out in Spain. An exponential variation of salt concentration with wind speed is presented in previous published papers. However, in the studied case, another relationship is proposed, which is based on chloride deposition on the wet <b>candle</b> <b>device</b> and wind speeds higher than 3. 0 m s− 1 weighted by the accumulated time in which these wind speeds are observed, what seems to be particularly useful when wind speed ranges around the critical value.

40|$|Durability of {{concrete}} structures under marine environments {{has been studied}} for a long time. This work was focused on marine atmosphere zone and studied the deposition of chlorides on wet <b>candle</b> <b>devices</b> and its relation with chlorides accumulated into concrete. Concrete specimens with three different mixtures were exposed at places located at four different distances from the sea. Periodically, chloride profiles were obtained and analysed taking into account environmental data. Results of numerical extrapolations show that chloride deposition rate on the wet candle {{can be used as}} an environmental indicator, helping to preview the expectancy of service life {{of concrete}} structures or suggesting minimum concrete cover thicknesses for a required service life. Regarding the studied region, service life decreases between 30 % and 60 % were observed when changing chloride deposition from 120 mg/m 2 day to 500 mg/m 2 day, which shows that chloride deposition plays an important role as an environmental indicator on service-life analysis of concrete structures in marine atmosphere zone...|$|R
40|$|High {{levels of}} marine salt {{deposition}} present in coastal areas have a relevant effect on road runoff characteristics. This study assesses this effect {{with the purpose}} of identifying the relationships between monitored water quality parameters and intrinsic site variables. To achieve this objective, an extensive monitoring program was conducted on a Portuguese coastal highway. The study included 30 rainfall events, in different weather, traffic, and salt deposition conditions. The evaluations of various water quality parameters were carried out in over 200 samples. In addition, the meteorological, hydrological, and traffic parameters were continuously measured. The salt deposition rates were determined by means of a wet <b>candle</b> <b>device,</b> which is an innovative feature of the monitoring program. The relation between road runoff pollutants and independent variables associated with weather, traffic, and salt deposition conditions was assessed. Significant correlations among pollutants were observed. A high salinity concentration and its influence on the road runoff were confirmed. Furthermore, the concentrations of the most relevant pollutants seemed to be very dependent on some meteorological variables, particularly the duration of the antecedent dry period prior to each rainfall event and the average wind speed. Part of this study was developed within a project financed by the Portuguese National Foundation for Science and Technology (PTDC/AMB/ 64953 / 2006).

40|$|Includes bibliography. The {{assessment}} {{in this study}} is aimed at informing and modifying the design method for RC structures that are not in direct contact with seawater but are within the marine environment. The evaluation of the severity of the exposure environment will enable an informed design of concrete structures that satisfies their desired service life and durability performance. In order to classify the severity of exposure, this study measured the concentration of airborne chlorides of select locations in the Cape Peninsula area, using the wet <b>candle</b> <b>device.</b> Five monitoring stations were exposed around the Cape Peninsula area at varying distances of 50 m, 150 m, 250 m, 2. 7 km and 13. 5 km from the coastline. Samples from the stations were collected twice every month over a period of 12 months and analysed for their chloride deposition rates. A site-based study which involved the collection of concrete samples from existing structures at varying distances from the sea and investigating their chloride content was also carried out. In addition, data from previous forensic investigations (chloride profiles of structures) carried out from 1996 – 2013 were also collated and analysed. Both analyses were carried out in order to further validate if the distance of a RC from the coastline influenced the chloride deposition rate and surface chloride content of the structure. The local climate and weather conditions, with a focus on the dominating wind direction, wind speed, precipitation and relative humidity were also examined...|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{could look}} less ghostly now than the haunted gallery. Fires roared up a wide chimney at either end, long rows of figures clad in armor stood on each side, one mailed hand {{grasping}} a lance, the other bearing a lighted <b>candle,</b> a <b>device</b> of Sir Jasper's. Narrow windows pierced {{in the thick}} walls let in gleams of wintry moonlight; ivy, holly, and evergreen glistened in the ruddy glow of mingled firelight and candle shine. From the arched stone roof hung tattered banners, {{and in the midst}} depended a great bunch of mistletoe. Red-cushioned seats stood in recessed window nooks, and from behind a high-covered screen of oak sounded the blithe air of Sir Roger de Coverley.|$|R
50|$|Delivery of {{the above}} air {{freshener}} mechanisms falls into two broad categories: continuous action and instant action. Continuous action products include scented <b>candles</b> and <b>devices</b> which use a candle flame or some other heat source to heat and vaporize a fragrance formulation, incense burners, wall plug-ins which either use piezoelectric technology to aerosolize fragrance or heat to vaporize it, fragrance impregnated gels which release fragrance as the gel evaporates sometimes {{with the help of}} an electric fan, wick and reed diffusers which release fragrance by evaporation from fragrance-soaked wicks or wooden reeds; and fragrance impregnated materials like floor wax, paper, plastics, wood which release fragrance by off gassing; and lastly nebulization systems which convert liquid fragrances into a vapor in a cold process without the use of heat.|$|R

The practice of singeing was popular approximately a century ago; {{it was believed that}} hair had [...] "fluid" [...] in it and singeing would trap the fluid in. Singeing is supposed to have beneficial effects - sealing cut ends, closing up the follicles, preventing the hair from bleeding (This belief has since been debunked.) and encouraging it to grow. [...] Singeing is still sometimes used to bond natural hair to hair extensions.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Wright of Derby painted five {{paintings}} {{on the theme of}} a blacksmith's shop or a forge between the years 1771 and 1773. The Derby Museum version is of a blacksmith's shop where three men work to manufacture an iron or steel component. The presence of visitors and the nocturnal work is explained by the farrier working outside. Wright has imagined that a traveller has broken down on a journey and the farrier is therefore working by the light of a <b>candle.</b> This <b>device</b> allows Wright to show off his skill and interest in light and shadow. To the right of the picture is an idle man leaning on a stick. Nicholson notes that this person is not dealt with harshly but with respect. The man appears too old to work but offers gravitas to those that are.Investigations of one of Wright's blacksmith's paintings has revealed the lengths that Wright went to achieve his image. Beneath the image of the ingot and hidden by layers of both yellow and white investigaters found a small piece of gold leaf that Wright had placed there two centuries before. The gold is not thought to have added to the painting, but Wright obviously thought it might in some way.|$|R
5000|$|A {{much later}} {{representation}} of the phrase {{is seen in the}} Richard O'Brien's 1973 musical, The Rocky Horror Show, and its subsequent 1975 film counterpart, in the 6th song of the show, titled [...] "The Sword of Damocles". In this song, the titular character, Rocky Horror, is created in a Frankenstein-esque fashion by the housemaster, Dr. Frank-N-Furter, and his first words & thoughts (presented in song form) upon creation were [...] "The sword of Damocles is hanging over my head, and I've got the feeling someone's gonna be cutting the thread!" [...] This is meant to act as a foreshadowing of the events following the show's second act, as Rocky seems to find himself in constant danger of torment at the hands of Riff Raff, the in-house handyman, who tortures him using a lit <b>candle</b> (the torture <b>device</b> varies, depending on the version of the show).|$|R
40|$|Everyday {{life can}} no longer be {{imagined}} without fragrances and scented products. For the consumer, countless products exists which are solely or partly intended to give off a certain scent in sufficient concentrations to odorize a complete room. Sprays, diffusers and evaporators, scented <b>candles</b> and automatic <b>devices</b> for the distribution of fragrance liquids are typical examples of such products. If the consumer uses such products, his consent to the release of certain chemicals in his home can be implied, however, he may not know what kind of fragrance substances and solvents will be present in which concentrations. In this study, we determined the volatile emissions of a number of fragrance products in detail. Measurements were carried out under controlled conditions in test chambers. The products were tested in a passive (unused) and an active state, wherever applicable. Following a defined test protocol, the release of volatile organic compounds, ultrafine particles and NO x was monitored for each product. The potential for forming secondary organic aerosols under the influence of ozone was studied, and for a selection of products the long-term emission behavior was assessed. A remarkable variety of fragrance substances was found and more than 100 relevant compounds were identified and quantified. While it is the intended function of such products to release fragrance substances, also considerable amounts of non-odorous solvents and by-products were found to be released from several air fresheners. Emissions rates exceeding 2 mg/(unit*h) were measured for the five most common solvents...|$|R
