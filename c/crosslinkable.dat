40|$|<b>Crosslinkable</b> mixed matrix {{membranes}} {{represent an}} attractive technology that promises both outstanding separation properties and swelling resistance for the purification of natural gas. This approach relies upon dispersal of a CO 2 /CH 4 size-discriminating zeolite in a <b>crosslinkable</b> polymer, which is resistant to CO 2 swelling when crosslinked. The resulting membrane {{has the potential}} to separate CO 2 from CH 4 more effectively than traditional pure polymer membranes, while also providing needed membrane stability in the presence of aggressive CO 2 -contaminated natural gas streams. Control studies are conducted using the pure <b>crosslinkable</b> polymer to observe the separation properties and swelling resistance. Initial <b>crosslinkable</b> mixed matrix membrane experiments are then performed and result in an increase in membrane productivity, instead of the expected increase in selectivity. Traditionally, this is caused by material incompatibility at the polymer/zeolite interface, so the <b>crosslinkable</b> mixed matrix membranes are characterized to examine this issue.

40|$|Despite {{intrinsically}} high separation performance, conventional polymeric membranes {{suffer from}} CO₂ induced plasticization, which reduces CO₂/CH₄ separation efficiency significantly. Covalent ester-crosslinking {{can improve the}} plasticization resistance by controlling the segmental chain mobility in the polymer; however, only relatively thick selective skin layers and lower separation productivity {{have been reported to}} date. On the other hand, the high cost of <b>crosslinkable</b> polymers makes the approach challenging, especially for large-scale gas separations which require large membrane areas with high feed pressures. Dual-layer hollow fiber spinning can be used to reduce the cost of membrane production by integrating a low-cost supporting core polymer with the expensive <b>crosslinkable</b> sheath polymer. However, the complexity of interfacial interaction between the sheath/core layers and subsequent crosslinking required can delaminate the sheath/core layers and collapse the core layer polymer. This can reduce mechanical strength and the separation productivity significantly. This work aimed to develop thin-skinned high-performing ester-crosslinked hollow fiber membranes with improved CO₂ plasticization resistance. The skin layer thickness of hollow fibers was first optimized by simultaneous optimization of the polymer dope and spinning process variables. Moreover, this study also addresses the solutions of challenging in transitioning the monolithic hollow fiber to composite hollow fiber format. The ester-crosslinked hollow fibers were subjected to high feed pressures and high-level contaminants to probe their CO₂ plasticization and hydrocarbon antiplasticization resistance, respectively. The resultant ester-crosslinked monolithic hollow fibers show significantly reduced skin layer thickness and improved separation productivity under extremely challenging operation conditions. They also demonstrate strong stability under high feed pressures and reversibility after contaminant exposure. Moreover, this study presents a newly discovered core layer material, Torlon®, which demonstrates excellent compatibility with the <b>crosslinkable</b> polymer and superior thermal stability during crosslinking without sheath/core layer delamination or collapse. The characterization under aggressive feed conditions clearly suggests that ester-crosslinked composite hollow fibers can achieve high separation performance and reduce membrane cost simultaneously.

The effect of the crosslinking reaction on the glass transition temperatures (T(g) s) is observed. In the range of molecular masses studied, the T(g) s after crosslinking are predominantly dependent on the intrinsic nature of the polymer and are not dependent on the final crosslink density. However, T(g) s of partially crosslinked polymers {{are related to the}} concentration of chain-ends consumed by the crosslinking reaction. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} to fabrication high-efficiency hole-transport layers (HTL) for polymer ligh-emitting diodes (PLED) was discussed. HTL fabricated by this approach had two components {{which include a}} siloxane-derivatized, <b>crosslinkable,</b> hole-transporting material and a hole-transporting polymer. It {{was found that the}} PLEDs that were fabricated using this PLEDs exhibit superior performance versus analogous devices using a conventional poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) - poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) HTL. The results show that, this approach has considerable flexibility and can be applied as a general strategy to manipulate energy level alignments in PLEDs...|$|E
