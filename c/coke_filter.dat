40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{operation}} and emission characteristics of a novel design four chambers infectious meat incinerator. This incinerator is internally divided into primary, secondary, intermediate and heat exchanger chambers. In the primary chamber, the infectious meat is burned using 95 – 200 kW burner, the combustion products are then passed through the intermediate chamber, the secondary chamber, and eventually through the heat exchanger chamber. A 50 kW burner is installed in the secondary chamber to complete the combustion of CO and to destruct the dioxin. Fresh air is then introduced to the flue gases to dilute the emission concentrations and to reduce the flue gas temperature. The flue gas is finally cleaned using an activated <b>coke</b> <b>filter</b> which is installed before the incinerator stack. The incinerator has been field tested at varied charging capacities of infectious meat, varied air to fuel ratios, and different combustion chamber temperatures. The emission concentration of particulate matter (P. M.), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx,), heavy metals, and dioxin have been measured at the maximum charging capacity of the incinerator. As {{a result of this}} work, it is proved that this incinerator offers an accepted and permanent solution to waste pollution problems that caused by infectious meat. The measured emissions of this incinerator highly comply with the maximum permitted emission limits of the environmental law. The heat exchanger reduced the flue gas temperature to 160 °C and increased the economic viability of the incinerator; about 50 % of th...|$|E

500|$|By mid-1886, {{the works}} was complete, and the Mayor, J. W. Pye-Smith Esq, officially opened it on 2 June. The event was {{witnessed}} {{by members of}} the Council, and by invited guests, which included a representative from the London Metropolitan Board of Works. Reports at the time indicated that the sewage passed through catch pits by gravity, allowing solids to settle, which were removed weekly. Milk of lime was then added as it flowed through mixing channels, after which it entered rectangular settling tanks. Next it passed on to a number of precipitating tanks, each holding , where after 30 minutes of settling, it passed over aerating weirs. Finally it ran through <b>coke</b> <b>filters</b> and was discharged into the river. Around [...] of sludge was removed from the precipitating tanks each day, to be pumped into ponds. Once the water had drained off, it was moved to drying beds, and was then used as manure by farmers, or was taken by rail to a tip at Kilnhurst, near Rotherham. Initially, there were 30 precipitating tanks and 60 aerating or filtering tanks.|$|R
40|$|Im Rahmen dieses Foerderprojektes wurden in der Forschungspyrolyseanlage der DBI Rohstoff- und Anlagentechnik GmbH Freiberg die Einsatzmaterialien -PAK-kontaminiertes Holz - Autoleichtshredder - Aluminiumhaltige Kunststoffabfaelle - Teppichreste - Lackierereiabfaelle pyrolysiert. Das PKA-Pyrolyseverfahren ist durch folgende Verfahrensschritte gekennzeichnet: -Aufbereitung der Einsatzstoffe auf die fuer den Prozess erforderliche Koernung und Aushaltung ferromagnetischer Bestandteile - Pyrolyseanlage zur thermischen Behandlung der Einsatzstoffe und Spaltung in die Produkte Pyrolysereststoff sowie Pyrolyserohgas in der indirekt beheizten Pyrolysetrommel bei ca. 550 C -Crackung der im Pyrolyserohgas enthaltenen Kohlenwasserstoffe bei Temperaturen von 110 bis 1200 C - Gasreinigung, bestehend aus einer mehrstufigen Gaswaesche, Trockenentschwefelung und Aktivkoksfilter. Durch ein umfangreiches Probenahme-, Mess- und Analysenprogramm wurden die Verfahrensschritte Pyrolyse und Gascrackung und das Gesamtverfahren untersucht. Auf dieser Grundlage sind Aussagen zur Stoff- und Energiebilanzierung, zur Schadstoffreduzierung und zu Emissionen moeglich. Die Ergebnisse dienen als Basis fuer die Projektierung von thermischen Entsorgungsanlagen. Weiterhin wurden wertvolle Erkenntnisse zu Verbesserungen der Gascrackung und Staubabscheidung aus dem Spaltgas gewonnen. So wurde der Gascracker mit Steinkohlenkoksbefuellung durch eine kokslose Technologie ersetzt und der Staub im Spaltgas mit einem Schlauchfilter abgeschieden. Auf Grund der Variabilitaet der stofflichen Zusammensetzung der Einsatzstoffe sind auch die Bilanzergebnisse sehr unterschiedlich. Bei allen Einsatzstoffen wurde eine starke Reduzierung der Massen und Volumina der festen Reststoffe erreicht und ein energetisch verwertbares Reingas produziert. Die Verwertung der Pyrolysereststoffe durch Hochtemperaturvergasung ist nicht Gegenstand dieses Foerderprojektes. (orig.) Within the {{framework}} of this sponsored project, the following materials were pyrolysed at the pyrolysis plant operated by DBI Rohstoff- und Anlagentechnik GmbH for research purposes at Freiberg: PAH-contaminated wood, shredded car parts, aluminium-containing plastic waste, used carpets, and paint shop wastes. The PKA pyrolysis technique {{is characterized by the}} following process steps: conditioning of materials to the grain size required for the process and elimination of ferromagnetic components, pyrolysis for thermal treatment and for breaking a material up into the products pyrolysis residue and crude pyrolysis gas in an indirectly heated pyrolysis drum at approximately 550 C, cracking of hydrocarbons contained in the crude pyrolysis gas at temperatures between 110 and 1200 C, and flue gas cleaning by means of of multi-stage gas scrubbing, dry desulfurization and activated <b>coke</b> <b>filters.</b> In a comprehensive sampling, measuring and analysis program, the process steps pyrolysis and gas cracking and the overall process were investigated. On this basis statements can be made regarding material and energy budgets, pollutant control, and emissions. The results serve as a basis for the planning of thermal disposal plants. Furthermore, valuable knowledge was obtained on how to enhance gas cracking and dust precipitation from the cracked gas. Thus, the gas cracker with hard-coal-coke filling was replaced by a cokeless unit, and dust in the cracked gas was precipitated by means of a tube filter. On account of the variability of composition of the materials used, budgeting results vary greatly, too. For all materials used, the mass and volume of solid residues could be substantially reduced; the clean gas produced can be used as an energy source. Processing of the pyrolysis residues by high-temperature gasification is not the object of this research project. (orig.)

40|$|Extracts of soots {{obtained}} {{from various sources}} were applied to the skin of mice {{in an effort to}} identify carcinogens in these mixtures and to link these materials to the etiology of human cancer. Samples of coal chimney soot, coke oven materials, industrial carbon black, oil shale soot, and gasoline vehicle exhaust materials have been examined by this method. The studies reported here have been constructed to compare the carcinogenic and tumorigenic potency of extracts from various particulate emissions: coke ovens, diesel and gasoline vehicles and a roofing tar pot. Automobile emission samples were obtained by collecting the diluted and cooled exhaust on Teflon-coated glass fiber <b>filters.</b> <b>Coke</b> oven and roofing tar samples were particulate emission samples collected by impaction and filtration. The organic components associated with each of the particles were extracted with dichloromethane and dermally applied to SENCAR mice. All agents were applied as tumor initiators by using a five-dose protocol. Selected extracts were also applied as complete carcinogens and as tumor promotors. Statistical analyses of the resulting tumor data were performed by using nonlinear Poisson and probit models. The results from these experiments provide a suitable data base for comparative potency estimation of complex mixtures...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present some final {{results from a}} {{research}} project focused on introducing automatic control to the operation of cupola iron furnaces. The main aim {{of this research is}} to improve the operational efficiency and performance of the cupola furnace, an important foundry process used to melt iron. Previous papers have described the development of appropriate control system architectures for the cupola. These results are summarized. Then we describe the experimental results obtained with the U. S. Department of Energy Albany Research Center`s research cupola. First, experimental data is used to calibrate the model, which is taken as a first-order multivariable system with time delay. Then relative gain analysis is used to select loop pairings to be used in a multi-loop controller. The resulting controller pairs meltrate with blast volume, iron temperature with oxygen addition, and carbon composition with percent <b>coke.</b> Special (nonlinear) <b>filters</b> are used to compute meltrate from actual scale readings of the amount of iron produced and to smooth the temperature measurement. The temperature and meltrate loops use single-loop PI control. The composition loop uses a Smith predictor to discount the deadtime associated with mass transport through the furnace. Experimental results validate the conceptual controller design and provide proof-of-concept of the idea of controlling a foundry cupola. Future research directions are discussed, including the concept of an integrated, intelligent industrial process controller, or I{sup 3 }PC...|$|R
