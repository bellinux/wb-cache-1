25|$|The {{original}} {{objectives of}} converting to digital transmission were to enable higher fidelity, more stations and more resistance to noise, <b>co-channel</b> <b>interference</b> and multipath than in analogue FM radio.

The system spectral efficiency (the average number of radio programmes per MHz and transmitter) is a factor three more efficient than analogue FM for local radio stations. For national and regional radio networks, the efficiency is improved by more than an order of magnitude due to the use of SFNs. In that case, adjacent transmitters use the same frequency.|$|E

2500|$|Numerical example: Analog FM {{requires}} 0.2MHz per programme. The {{frequency reuse}} factor {{in most countries}} is approximately 15, meaning that {{only one out of}} 15 transmitter sites can use the same channel frequency without problems with <b>co-channel</b> <b>interference,</b> i.e. cross-talk. [...] Assuming a total availability of 102 FM channels at a bandwidth of 0.2MHz over the Band II spectrum of 87.5 to 108.0 MHz, an average of 102/15 = 6.8 radio channels are possible on each transmitter site (plus lower-power local transmitters causing less interference). This results in a system spectral efficiency of 1 / 15 / (0.2 MHz) = 0.30 programmes/transmitter/MHz. DAB with 192 kbit/s codec requires 1.536MHz * 192 kbit/s / 1,136 kbit/s = 0.26MHz per audio programme. The frequency reuse factor for local programmes and multi-frequency broadcasting networks (MFN) is typically 4 or 5, resulting in 1 / 4 / (0.26MHz) = 0.96 programmes/transmitter/MHz. [...] This is 3.2 times as efficient as analog FM for local stations. For single frequency network (SFN) transmission, for example of national programmes, the channel re-use factor is 1, resulting in 1/1/0.25MHz = 3.85 programmes/transmitter/MHz, which is 12.7 times as efficient as FM for national and regional networks.|$|E

The analysis of capacity region with the rate constraints is facilitated by our tool of multi-dimensional conflict graph (MDCG) [12], which systematically describes all kinds of conflict relationships in an MR-MC network.

This {{is designed to}} balance the trade-off between <b>co-channel</b> <b>interferences</b> from nodes hops away, and the total power consumed by all the nodes. Three metrics are considered in the route discovery process in order to select the best route: hop count, power budget and overlaps between adjacent beams. By exploiting the directionality of directional antennas, the proposed DSR-based directional routing protocol is capable of reducing the overlaps between beams of the nodes along the route, hence eliminating the interference. Arbitrary networks and random networks are considered in our simulations. The results show considerable performance gains for transmission of real-time traffic over ad hoc networks.
