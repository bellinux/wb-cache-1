Aluminium Silicon (Al/Si) alloy MMC has been widely used in various industrial sectors such as in transportation, domestic equipment, aerospace, military, construction, etc. Aluminium silicon alloy is an MMC that had been reinforced with aluminium nitrate (AlN) particle and become a new generation material use in automotive and aerospace sector. The AlN {{is one of the}} advance material that have a bright prospect in future since it has features such as lightweight, high strength, high hardness and stiffness quality. However, the high degree of ceramic particle reinforcement and the irregular nature of the particles along the matrix material that contribute to its low density is the main problem which leads to difficulties in machining process. This paper examined the tool wear when milling AlSi/AlN Metal Matrix Composite using a TiB 2 (Titanium diboride) coated carbide cutting tool. The volume of the AlN reinforced particle was 10 % and milling process was carried out under dry cutting condition. The TiB 2 coated carbide insert parameters used were at the cutting speed of (230, 300 and 370 m/min, feed rate of 0. 8, Depth of Cut (DoC) at 0. 4 m). The Sometech SV- 35 video microscope system used to quantify of the tool wear. The result shown that tool life span increasing with the cutting speeds at (370 m/min, feed rate of 0. 8 mm/tooth and DoC at 0. 4 mm) which constituted an optimum condition for longer tool life lasted until 123. 2 mins. Meanwhile, at medium cutting speed which at 300 m/m, feed rate of 0. 8 mm/tooth and depth of cut at 0. 4 mm we found that tool life span lasted until 119. 86 mins while at low cutting speed it lasted in 119. 66 mins. High cutting speed will give the best parameter in cutting AlSi/AlN MMCs material. The result will help manufacturers in machining process of AlSi/AlN MMCs materials.

40|$|AbstractAdhesion {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} characteristics of coating on cutting tools. Poor coating adhesion on the tool favors fragmentation and release of hard abrasive particles between the tool and the workpiece. These particles interact with the surfaces of the tool, accelerating its wear and decreasing tool life. One possible solution is the use of laser texturing prior to coating in order to achieve a desired surface topography with enhanced adhesion properties. In the texturing, a high-frequency short-pulse laser changes surface characteristics, generating resolidified material and selective vaporization. This work evaluated the effectiveness of laser texturing in improving the substrate–coating adhesion of PVD <b>coated</b> <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> <b>tools.</b> To this end, the substrates were textured with a Nd:YAG laser, in four different intensities, and then coated with a PVD TiAlN film. To ascertain the effectiveness of laser texturing, Rockwell C indentation and turning experiments were performed on both textured tools and conventional unlasered tools. The PVD coated laser-textured tool showed better performance in the indentation and turning tests than the standard tools. A comparative evaluation of tool wear mechanisms indicated that texturing did not change the wear mechanisms, but altered their importance to tool wear. The anchoring provided by the higher roughness of the textured surface increased the adhesion of the coating on the substrate, thus increasing tool life. Additionally, the chemical modification of the carbide grains due to the laser heating might be responsible for an enhanced adhesion between coating and substrate...|$|R

Three cutting parameters namely cutting speed, feed and depth of cut with three different levels and two types of cutting tools (coated and uncoated) were considered for conducting the experimental trials. Intermittent face milling was employed to study the wear behaviour of the tools and the resulting surface roughness. The cyclic load induced during the entry and exit of the tool, leads to unstable temperature at cutting zone. This unstable temperature affects the tool life badly during intermittent milling. Tool wear increases considerably with an increase in frequency of the interruption. The experimental results indicated that the coated tool out performed uncoated tool in terms of tool life and surface finish. The other interesting observation was the uncoated tool performed better than coated tool at moderate cutting parameters. Results also indicated that the fracture and chipping were the dominant tool failure modes in uncoated tool. The chipping of uncoated tool causes the surface quality to deteriorate. TiN coating ensures the toughness of the cutting tool, which leads to good surface quality during the machining process. A detailed analysis of tool wear and surface roughness was done and the results are employed to create a linear regression model. This model established the relation between the cutting parameters and the response variables. ANOVA was used to identify the influential parameters which affect the tool wear and surface roughness...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{evaluate}} the wear performance of a physical vapor deposition (PVD) <b>coating</b> on <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> (WC) <b>tool</b> used in friction stir welding FSW processing of Ti alloy sheets. Design/methodology/approach: A coating of AlCrN material was applied to a WC tool {{in order to increase}} its wear resistance, thermal shock stability and hot hardness. In comparison to the conventional coatings, the AlCrN coating system had a higher resistance to abrasive wear as well as higher hot hardness and oxidation resistance. FSW processing of Ti with a coated WC tool was expected to have better performance than an uncoated tool. Back Scattering Electron (BSE) imaging mode at scanning electron microscope was used to determine the main mechanism of tool wear, which was found to be hot adhesion and inter-diffusion of tool constituents with the workpiece materials. Findings: The tool degradation was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy in order to observe the main tool wear mechanism. The real contribution of the (Al,Cr) N coating layer could not be correctly evaluated, since there is no residual trace of its components at the worn tool. What was probably found left from the coating layer was the N component which formed the nitride TiN observed by EDS mapping. The parameter conditions were probably too severe, overcoming the layer limit strength. Research limitations/implications: The research were carried out as a preliminary evaluation and this initial results in the need of a further analysis that should be performed looking for a suitable tool material and coating optimization for the FSW processing of titanium alloys. Practical implications: Despite being successfully used in other manufacturing applications like machining operations in which friction and temperature are also high, the WC tool material and the coating had an unsatisfactory wear resistance, and the AlCrN coating was totally worn during the FSW processing. This suggests that new materials and coatings are still needed for FSW tools. Originality/value: FSW process is gaining importance as an industrial joining method, but the tool wear is still an important challenge to achieve efficient and economic operation. Because of the low thermal conductivity and high chemical reactivity of Ti, tools wear rapidly due to high temperature and strong adhesion. In order to achieve higher processing speeds, reducing heat at the interface tool/work material is required, as is the use of tool materials that have little or no chemical affinity...|$|R

The inhibitor that suppress tungsten <b>carbide</b> leaching of <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> <b>tool</b> is investigated by soaking experiments, friction experiments, SEM analysis, and energy spectrum analysis. The test result shows that aqueous solution and sodium carbonate will cause tungsten carbide leaching through oxidative dissolution; but compound boricacidester contain benzotriazole could suppress tungsten carbide leaching. The Inhibition mechanism is that compound boricacidester contain benzotriazole could generate complete and compact protective film {{on the surface of}} <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> <b>tool,</b> therefore, tungsten <b>carbide</b> leaching is inhibited.
