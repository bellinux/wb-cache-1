40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{manuscript}} is to bridge existing knowledge gaps by undertaking comprehensive investigation of several high and medium-rise structures in Iran with different damping devices embedded within <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> <b>of</b> shear walls. To further extend understanding of damping devices embedded within <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> <b>of</b> shear walls, these structures are treated {{under a variety of}} different earthquake excitations and the results are compared in order to capture their advantages in creating efficient damping systems. The research will address the needs of local industries. It aims to carry out a comprehensive investigation on seismic mitigation of high and medium-rise structures with different damping devices embedded within <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> <b>of</b> shear walls at different locations across the height of each structure. Nonlinear finite element modeling approach has been used in the current study...|$|R

5|$|Another segment, Debussy's Clair de lune, was {{developed}} {{as part of}} the film's original program. After being completely animated, it was <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the final film to shorten its lengthy running time. The animation depicted two Great white herons flying through the Florida Everglades on a moonlit night. The sequence was later edited and re-scored for the Blue Bayou segment in Make Mine Music (1946). In 1992, a workprint of the original was discovered and Clair de Lune was restored, complete with the original soundtrack of Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra. It was included as a bonus feature in The Fantasia Anthology DVD in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{itself was}} {{occupied}} by {{a unit of the}} Royal Armoured Corps, who served as observers; the soldiers appear to have relied on the stone walls for protection rather than trenches, and, unusually, no additional firing points were <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the stonework, as typically happened elsewhere. The surrounding beaches were defended with lines of barbed wire, slit trenches and square weapons pits, reinforced by concrete pillboxes to the north and south of the castle, at least partially laid down by the 1st Battalion Essex Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives late to {{the crime}} scene and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) tells her that the man's blood all drained {{abruptly}} in the hotel. A child’s bloody print is found, but Scully doesn’t believe that a child did this. Meanwhile, the beggar, somehow disguised as an ordinary-looking Caucasian man, applies for a janitorial job at a Cheverly, Maryland elementary school. In the morgue, Scully describes the massive stomach damage done to the body which leads Doggett to the idea of drugs being forcibly <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> him. However, the man showed no sign of drugs in the blood tests and Scully tells Doggett that his time of death was 24 to 36 hours prior, long before he left India. Due to a discrepancy in weight, she begins to believe that there was a passenger in the corpse.|$|E

2500|$|While the Nahua {{paintings}} {{remain the}} most important craft form related to amate paper, the Otomi have adopted their elaborate <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> figures to the commercial market as well. This began with shamans creating booklets with miniature <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> <b>of</b> gods with handwritten explanations. Eventually, these began to sell and this success led to their commercialization in markets in Mexico City, were the Otomi connected with the Nahua in the 1960s. The Otomi still sell <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> in traditional designs, but have also experimented with newer designs, paper sizes, colors and types <b>of</b> paper. These <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> include depictions <b>of</b> various gods, especially those related to beans, coffee, corn, pineapples, tomatoes and rain. However, these <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> are not 100% authentic, with exact replicas still reserved to shamans for ritual purposes. Innovation has included the development <b>of</b> books, and <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> <b>of</b> suns, flowers, birds, abstract designs from traditional beadwork and even Valentine hearts with painted flowers. Most <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> are made <b>of</b> one type of paper, then glued onto a contrasting background. Their sizes range from miniatures in booklets to sizes large enough to frame and hang like a painting. [...] The production and sale of these paper products have brought tourism to San Pablito, mostly from Hidalgo, Puebla and Mexico City, but some come from the far {{north and south of}} Mexico and even from abroad.|$|R
5|$|During the 13th {{century the}} native Welsh princes built {{a number of}} stone castles. The size of these varied {{considerably}} from smaller fortifications, such as Dinas Emrys in Snowdonia, to more substantial castles like Deganwy Castle and the largest, Castell y Bere. Native Welsh castles typically maximised the defensive benefits of high, mountainous sites, often being built in an irregular shape to fit a rocky peak. Most had deep ditches <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the rock to protect the main castle. The Welsh castles were usually built with a relatively short keep, used as living accommodation for princes and nobility, and with distinctive rectangular watch-towers along the walls. In comparison to Norman castles the gatehouses were much weaker in design, with almost no use of portcullises or spiral staircases, and the stonework of the outer walls was also generally inferior to Norman built castles. The very last native Welsh castles, built in the 1260s, more closely resemble Norman designs; {{in the case of}} Dinas Brân including a round keep and Norman gatehouse defences.|$|E
5|$|Herdwick lambs {{are born}} black, {{and after a}} year they lighten to a dark brown colour (the sheep are called hoggs or hoggets at this stage). After the first shearing, their fleece lightens further to grey. Rams are horned, and ewes polled. For shows and auctions, Herdwicks {{traditionally}} have their wool ruddied up (the local term for raddled) with dye. Rams are also ruddied when put out with the ewes to show which have been mated, and the dye is also one method (called a smit) of marking sheep for ownership. Before chemical dyes became available, this dye was made from either iron ore or graphite mixed with grease. For many years the legal method of identifying a particular shepherd's sheep were notches <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a sheep's ear, called lug marks—now replaced by ear tags.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Bantam Books {{published}} a movie tie-in novelization written by Mike McQuay that adopts a lean, humorous style {{reminiscent of the}} film. The novel is significant because it includes scenes that were <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the film, such as the Federal Reserve Depository robbery that results in Snake's incarceration. The novel provides motivation and backstory to Snake and Hauk— both disillusioned war veterans— deepening their relationship that was only hinted {{at it in the}} film. The novel explains how Snake lost his eye during the Battle for Leningrad in World War III, how Hauk became warden of New York, and Hauk's quest to find his crazy son who lives somewhere in the prison. The novel fleshes out the world that these characters exist in, at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film. The book explains that the West Coast is a no-man's land, and the country's population is gradually being driven crazy by nerve gas as a result of World War III.|$|E

His fellow trainees include Ferdiad, who becomes Cú Chulainn's best friend and foster-brother. During his time there, Scáthach faces a battle against Aífe, her rival and in some versions her twin sister. Scáthach, knowing Aífe's prowess, fears for Cú Chulainn's life and gives him a powerful sleeping potion to keep him from the battle. However, because of Cú Chulainn's great strength, it only puts him to sleep for an hour, and he soon joins the fray. He fights Aífe in single combat, and the two are evenly matched, but Cú Chulainn distracts her by calling out that Aífe's horses and chariot, the things she values most in the world, have fallen off a cliff, and seizes her. With his sword at her throat, he agrees to spare her life on the condition that she call off her enmity with Scáthach, and bear him a son.|$|E
5|$|The ice-cutting {{involved}} several {{stages and}} was typically {{carried out at}} night, when the ice was thickest. First the surface would be cleaned of snow with scrapers, {{the depth of the}} ice tested for suitability, then the surface would be marked out with cutters to produce the lines of the future ice blocks. The size of the blocks varied according to the destination, the largest being for the furthest locations, the smallest destined for the American east coast itself and being only 22inches (0.56 m) square. The blocks could finally be <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ice and floated to the shore. The speed of the operation might depend on the likelihood of warmer weather impacting on the ice. In both New England and Norway, harvesting occurred during an otherwise quiet season, providing valuable local employment.|$|E
5|$|It was {{difficult}} for crew members to perceive the film's quality {{during much of the}} production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design. Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially, but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting. According to Lee Unkrich, one of the original editors of Toy Story, a scene was <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the original final edit. The scene features Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently. Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the creators of the movie thought the audience would be loving Buzz and Woody at that point. Another scene, where Woody was trying to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie. Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.|$|E
