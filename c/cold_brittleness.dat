40|$|The {{annealing}} temperature {{within the range}} of 1223 - 2273 K has been studied for its effect on the grain size, mechanical properties, <b>cold</b> <b>brittleness</b> temperature, and nature of failure of sheets molybdenum alloys TsM- 6 and TsM- 10. The method of Auger-electron microscopy has been used to study the change of carbon and oxygen content on grain boundaries of the alloy TsM- 10 and the change of mechanical properties associated with it as dependent on the {{annealing temperature}}...|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{determine}} the failure modes of high altitude scientific balloons through an investigation of the fracture characteristics of the thin polyethylene films. Two films were the subject of the evaluation, Winzen Int. 's Stratafilm SF- 85 and Raven Industries' Astro-E. Research began with an investigation of the film's <b>cold</b> <b>brittleness</b> point and it's effect on the ultimate strength and elasticity of the polyethylene film. A series of preliminary investigations were conducted to develop an understanding of the material characteristics. The primary focus of this investigation was on the notch sensitivity of the films. Simple stress strain tests were also conducted to enable analysis employing fracture toughness parameters. Studies were conducted on both film types at 23 C (room temperature), - 60 C, - 90 C, and - 120 C...|$|E

Istraživan je utjecaj temperaturnog žarenja u dijapazonu 1223 - 2273 K na veličinu zrna, mehanička svojstva, temperaturu hladnog loma i karakter razaranja traka molibdenskih legura TsM- 6 i TsM- 10. Auger-metodom elektronske mikroskopije istraživana je promjena sadržaja ugljika i kisika na granici zrna legure Tsm- 10 i povezano s tim promjene mehaničkih karakteristika u zavisnosti od temperature žarenja...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{state of}} a {{low-temperature}} embrittlement (<b>cold</b> <b>brittleness)</b> and dislocation mechanisms for {{formation of the}} temperature of a ductile-brittle transition and brittle fracture of metals (mono- and polycrystals) with various crystal lattices (BCC, FCC, HCP) are considered. The conditions for their formation connected with a stress-deformed state and strength (low temperature yield strength) {{as well as the}} fracture breaking stress and mobility of dislocations in the top of a crack of the fractured metal are determined. These conditions can be met for BCC and some HCP metals in the initial state (without irradiation) and after a low-temperature damaging (neutron) irradiation. These conditions are not met for FCC and many HCP metals. In the process of the damaging (neutron) irradiation such conditions are not met also and the state of low-temperature embrittlement of metals is absent (suppressed) due to arising various radiation dynamic processes, which increase the mobility of dislocations and worsen the strength characteristics...|$|E
