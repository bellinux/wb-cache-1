40|$|Polyploidy, or whole genome duplication, {{has played}} a major role in the {{evolution}} of many eukaryotic lineages. Although the prevalence of polyploidy in plants is well documented, the molecular and cytological consequences are understood largely from newly formed polyploids (neopolyploids) that have been grown experimentally. Classical cytological and molecular cytogenetic studies both have shown that experimental neoallopolyploids often have meiotic irregularities, producing chromosomally variable gametes and progeny; however, little is known about the extent or duration of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>variation</b> in natural neoallopolyploid populations. We report the results of a molecular cytogenetic study on natural populations of a neoallopolyploid, Tragopogon miscellus, which formed multiple times in the past 80 y. Using genomic and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we uncovered massive and repeated patterns of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>variation</b> in all populations. No population was fixed for a particular karyotype; 76 % of the individuals showed intergenomic translocations, and 69 % were aneuploid for one or more chromosomes. Importantly, 85 % of plants exhibiting aneuploidy still had the expected chromosome number, mostly through reciprocal monosomy-trisomy of homeologous chromosomes (1 : 3 copies) or nullisomy-tetrasomy (0 : 4 copies). The extensive <b>chromosomal</b> <b>variation</b> still present after ca. 40 generations in this biennial species suggests that substantial and prolonged chromosomal instability might be common in natural populations after whole genome duplication. A protracted period of genome instability in neoallopolyploids may increase opportunities for alterations to genome structure, losses of coding and noncoding DNA, and changes in gene expression...|$|E

In both cases exchange of alleles at the locus is completely suppressed by the inversions. Four cases of linkage disequilibrium were detected among eighteen pairs of loci; two of them could best be explained as transient associations generated by random drift. The results suggest that disequilibria among enzyme loci are not widespread in natural populations—Populations with a lower degree of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>variation</b> are genetically as variable as populations with {{a higher degree of}} <b>chromosomal</b> <b>variation.</b> This observation does not support the hypothesis that selection in marginal homokaryotypic populations is for specialized homozygous genotypes...|$|E

We propose, instead, that cancer is a chromosomal disease. Accordingly carcinogenesis is initiated by random aneuploidies, which are induced by carcinogens or spontaneously.

Aneuploidy is therefore a steady source of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>variations</b> from which, in classical Darwinian terms, selection encourages the evolution and malignant progression of cancer cells. The rates of specific <b>chromosomal</b> <b>variations</b> can exceed conventional mutations by 4 – 11 orders of magnitude, depending on the degrees of aneuploidy.

The synaptonemal complex in spermatocytes showed normal chromosome pairings for all chromosomes, including the autosomal and sex trivalents.
