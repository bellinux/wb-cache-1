40|$|We {{observed}} that a YCp-type vector having the centromeric DNA (<b>CEN)</b> <b>sequence</b> previously {{isolated from the}} genome, but not a YRp-type vector lacking the <b>CEN</b> <b>sequence,</b> induced pseudohyphal growth in a dimorphic fungi, Candida maltosa, which had {{been shown to be}} closely related to Candida albicans by phylogenetic analysis. Deletion analysis of the <b>CEN</b> <b>sequence</b> revealed that the intact <b>CEN</b> <b>sequence</b> was not required for the induction, but part of it, having partial centromeric activity, was enough for the induction. By screening the gene library of this yeast for the sequences which induced pseudohyphal growth, we isolated three different DNA fragments which also had part of the centromere-like sequence. Partial centromeric activity of these fragments was confirmed by three criteria: low copy number and high stability of the plasmids carrying these fragments and rearrangement at high frequency of the plasmid DNA with one of these fragments plus the <b>CEN</b> <b>sequence.</b> Furthermore, when the GGTAGCG sequence commonly found in one copy in each of these four sequences was mutated in the <b>CEN</b> <b>sequence</b> by site-directed mutagenesis, both partial centromeric activity and pseudohyphal growth-inducing activity of the <b>CEN</b> <b>sequence</b> were lost. These results indicated that part of CEN region with partial centromeric activity induces pseudohyphal growth in C. maltosa. It is suggested that some cellular components which interact with the sequence containing GGTAGCG required for centromeric activity are involved in the regulation of the transition between yeast forms and pseudohyphal forms of the cells...|$|E
40|$|Additional {{copies of}} the centromeric DNA (CEN) region induce pseudohyphal growth in a dimorphic yeast, Candida maltosa (T. Nakazawa, T. Motoyama, H. Horiuchi, A. Ohta, and M. Takagi, J. Bacteriol. 179 : 5030 – 5036, 1997). To {{understand}} the mechanism of this transition, we screened the gene library of C. maltosa for sequences which could suppress this morphological change. As a result, we isolated the 5 ′ end of a new gene, EPD 1 (for essential for pseudohyphal development), and then cloned the entire gene. The predicted amino acid sequence of Epd 1 p was highly homologous to those of Ggp 1 /Gas 1 /Cwh 52 p, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Phr 1 p and Phr 2 p of Candida albicans. The expression of EPD 1 was moderately regulated by environmental pH. A homozygous EPD 1 null mutant showed some morphological defects and reduction in growth rate and reduced levels of both alkali-soluble and alkali-insoluble β-glucans. Moreover, the mutant could not undergo the transition from yeast form to pseudohyphal form induced by additional {{copies of the}} <b>CEN</b> <b>sequence</b> at pH 4 or by n-hexadecane at pH 4 or pH 7, suggesting that EPD 1 is not essential for yeast form growth but is essential for transition to the pseudohyphal form. Overexpression of the amino-terminal part of Epd 1 p {{under the control of}} the GAL promoter suppressed the pseudohyphal development induced by additional copies of the <b>CEN</b> <b>sequence,</b> whereas overexpression of the full-length EPD 1 did not. This result and the initial isolation of the 5 ′ end of EPD 1 as a suppressor of the pseudohyphal growth induced by the <b>CEN</b> <b>sequence</b> suggest that the amino-terminal part of Epd 1 p may have a dominant-negative effect on the functions of Epd 1 p in the pseudohyphal growth induced by the <b>CEN</b> <b>sequence...</b>|$|E
40|$|Two yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutants that {{tolerate}} centromere (CEN) plasmids at high {{copy number}} have been isolated. The mutations relieve the restraint normally imposed on plasmid copy number by a cloned <b>CEN</b> <b>sequence.</b> Our CEN plasmids specify resistance to G 418 and are high copy plasmids {{only when the}} mutant host cells are grown on medium containing this antibiotic. The high copy number of the plasmids is independent of the specific cloned <b>CEN</b> <b>sequence</b> and recovered plasmids show no alteration in structure or function of the CEN DNA. The efficiency with which CEN plasmids go to high copy number is increased if the mutant cell is cotransformed by another CEN plasmid. The genomic mutation responsible for the high copy number (COP) is dominant and stable, and it segregates in a Mendelian manner. Homozygous COP/COP a/alpha diploids do not tolerate CEN plasmids at high copy number, suggesting that the mutation is regulated by mating type. The genomic DNA from both mutant cells contains an altered transposon (Ty) restriction fragment that cosegregates with the COP phenotype in crosses of mutant and wild-type strains. The mutations may be transposon-mediated events that identify a gene involved in centromere or mitotic spindle function...|$|E
40|$|The linear {{chromosomes}} of eukaryotes contain specialized {{structures to}} ensure their faithful replication and segregation to daughter cells. Two of these structures, centromeres and telomeres, are limited, respectively, to one and two copies per chromosome. It {{is possible that the}} proteins that interact with centromere and telomere DNA sequences are present in limiting amounts and could be competed away from the chromosomal copies of these elements by additional copies introduced on plasmids. We have introduced excess centromeres and telomeres into Saccharomyces cerevisiae and quantitated their effects on the rates of loss of chromosome III and chromosome VII by fluctuation analysis. We show that (i) 600 new telomeres have no effect on chromosome loss; (ii) an average of 25 extra centromere DNA sequences increase the rate of chromosome HI loss from 0. 4 x 10 - 4 events per cell division to 1. 3 x 10 - 3 events per cell division; (iii) centromere DNA (<b>CEN)</b> <b>sequences</b> on circular vectors destabilize chromosomes more effectively than do <b>CEN</b> <b>sequences</b> on 15 -kb linear vectors, and transcribed <b>CEN</b> <b>sequences</b> have no effect on chromosome stability. We discuss the different effects of extra centromere and telomere DNA sequences on chromosome stability in terms of how the cell recognizes these two chromosomal structures.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{method for}} {{the isolation of}} baculovirus recombinants is described. The method involves the replication and maintenance of the baculovirus genome in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which was accomplished by the isolation of a baculovirus recombinant containing yeast ARS and <b>CEN</b> <b>sequences</b> ensuring stable replication in yeast and a URA 3 selectable marker. The viral DNA maintained its ability to replicate in insect cells. An efficient and rapid selection system was set up, to isolate viral recombinants in yeast; DNA from selected yeast colonies was transfected into insect cells to obtain recombinant virus. We demonstrate the utility of this system by isolating recombinant viruses that express two different members of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors...|$|R

Using the 2 mu chromosome-loss mapping technique and meiotic tetrad analysis, {{we have identified}} this DNA sequence as the centromere of chromosome V (CEN 5). The <b>CEN</b> 5 <b>sequence</b> has been localized on an 1, 100 -base-pair BamHI-BglII restriction fragment.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the chromatin structure of the centromere regions of chromosomes III and XI in yeast by using cloned functional centromere DNAs (EN 3 and CEN 7 1) as labeled probes. When chro-matin from isolated nuclei is digested with micro-coccal nuclease and the resulting DNA fragments separated electrophoretically and blotted to nitro-cellulose filters, the centromeric nucleosomal sub-units are resolved into significantly more distinct ladders than are those from {{the bulk of the}} chro-matin. A discrete protected region of 220 - 250 bp of <b>CEN</b> <b>sequence</b> flanked by highly nuclease-sen-sitive sites was revealed by mapping the exact nuclease cleavage sites within the centromeric chromatin. On both sides of this protected region, highly phased and specific nuclease cutting sites exist at nucleosomal intervals (160 bp) for a total length of 12 -l 5 nucleosomal subunits. The central protected region in the chromatin of both centro-meres spans the 130 bp segment that exhibits the highest degree of sequence homology (71 %) be-tween functional CEN 3 and CEN 17 DNAs. This unique chromatin structure is maintained on CEN sequences introduced into yeast on autonomously replicating plasmids, but is not propagated through foreign DNA sequences flanking the inserted yeast DNA...|$|E
40|$|Background: Kinetochores {{are large}} multi-protein {{structures}} that assemble on centromeric DNA (CEN DNA) and mediate the binding of chromosomes to microtubules. Comprising 125 base-pairs of CEN DNA and 70 or more protein components, Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinetochores {{are among the}} best understood. In contrast, most fungal, plant and animal cells assemble kinetochores on CENs that are longer and more complex, raising the question of whether kinetochore architecture has been conserved through evolution, despite considerable divergence in <b>CEN</b> <b>sequence.</b> Results: Using computational approaches, ranging from sequence similarity searches to hidden Markov model-based modeling, we show that organisms with CENs resembling those in S. cerevisiae (point CENs) are very closely related and that all contain a set of 11 kinetochore proteins not found in organisms with complex CENs. Conversely, organisms with complex CENs (regional CENs) contain proteins seemingly absent from point-CEN organisms. However, at least three quarters of known kinetochore proteins are present in all fungi regardless of CEN organization. At least six of these proteins have previously unidentified human orthologs. When fungi and metazoa are compared, almost all have kinetochores constructed around Spc 105 and three conserved multi-protein linker complexes (MIND, COMA, and the NDC 80 complex). Conclusion: Our data suggest that critical structural features of kinetochores have been well conserved from yeast to man. Surprisingly, phylogenetic analysis reveals that human kinetochore proteins are as similar in sequence to their yeast counterparts as to presumptive Drosophila melanogaster or Caenorhabditis elegans orthologs. This finding is consistent with evidence that kinetochore proteins have evolved very rapidly relative to components of other complex cellular structures.

40|$|Accurate {{chromosome}} segregation requires centromeres (<b>CENs),</b> the DNA <b>sequences</b> where kinetochores form, to attach chromosomes to microtubules. In contrast to most eukaryotes, which have broad centromeres, Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses sequence-defined point CENs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) reveals colocalization of four kinetochore proteins at novel, discrete, non-centromeric regions, especially when {{levels of the}} centromeric histone H 3 variant, Cse 4 (a. k. a. CENP-A or CenH 3), are elevated. These regions of overlapping protein binding enhance the segregation of plasmids and chromosomes and have thus been termed Centromere-Like Regions (CLRs). CLRs form {{in close proximity to}} S. cerevisiae CENs and share characteristics typical of both point and regional <b>CENs.</b> CLR <b>sequences</b> are conserved among related budding yeasts. Many genomic features characteristic of CLRs are also associated with these conserved homologous sequences from closely related budding yeasts.

40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the {{complete}} information needed in cis to specify a fully functional mitotic and meiotic centromere is contained within 120 bp arranged {{in the three}} conserved centromeric (CEN) DNA elements CDEI, -II, and -III. The 25 -bp CDEIII is most important for faithful chromosome segregation. We have constructed single- and double-base substitutions in all highly conserved residues and one nonconserved residue of this element and analyzed the mitotic in vivo function of the mutated CEN DNAs, using an artificial chromosome. The effects of the mutations on chromosome segregation vary between wild-type-like activity (chromosome loss rate of 4. 8 x 10 (- 4)) and a complete loss of CEN function. Data obtained by saturation mutagenesis of the palindromic core sequence suggest asymmetric involvement of the palindromic half-sites in mitotic CEN function. The poor CEN activity of certain single mutations could be improved by introducing an additional single mutation. These second-site suppressors {{can be found at}} conserved and nonconserved positions in CDEIII. Our suppression data are discussed in the context of natural CDEIII sequence variations found in the <b>CEN</b> <b>sequences</b> of different yeast chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|A DNA sequence-based {{phylogenetic tree}} (Dillon et al., 2004) places the {{species of the}} genus Sorghum into two sister lineages, one with x = 5 {{and the other with}} x = 10 as a basic {{chromosome}} number. It has not been resolved whether or not these lineages are monophyletic or polyphyletic. A repetitive <b>sequence,</b> <b>CEN</b> 38, found only in Sorghum and sugarcane, was used to assess evolutionary relationships among Sorghum species. The objectives of this research were to determine the taxonomic distribution of CEN 38, its chromosomal position(s), and its organization in DNA. CEN 38 was detected by filter hybridization to be present in the DNA of 16 of 21 Sorghum species analyzed, ranging from 15 to ~ 21, 000 copies. It was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) only in chromosomes of species of the section Eu-sorghum, where it had a pericentromeric distribution. The low copy number and/or chromosomal distribution of CEN 38 in other Sorghum species apparently does not allow for its detection by FISH. Analysis of restriction enzyme digested DNA with homology to CEN 38 and of fragments amplified by PCR using primers selected to amplify S. bicolor <b>CEN</b> 38 <b>sequences</b> showed that S. laxiflorum and S. macrospermum have tandemly arranged <b>CEN</b> 38 <b>sequences</b> as is found in S. bicolor. This supports the close evolutionary affinity of the species in the x = 10 lineage. In the x = 5 lineage, DNA of 11 of 16 species analyzed hybridized with CEN 38 by filter hybridization. In S. versicolor, large DNA fragments (4. 36 kb to 23 kb) generated by digestion with restriction enzymes hybridized to CEN 38. Since a ladder of smaller fragments was not detected, CEN 38 may have been inserted into a transposable element in this species and dispersed throughout the genome. Among species of the x = 5 lineage, PCR using primers for S. bicolor CEN 38 amplified only DNA fragments from S. timorense and these formed a ladder based on a ~ 125 bp repeat. Since hybridization of the <b>CEN</b> 38 <b>sequence</b> to DNA of S. timorense was not detected by filter hybridizations, these sequences apparently are not similar to CEN 38. Cloning and sequencing of DNA from species of the x = 5 lineage that hybridizes to CEN 38 are needed {{to determine whether or not}} they are in the CEN 38 family. A monophyletic or polyphyletic origin of the x = 5 and x = 10 lineages was not resolved...|$|R

We assume that the <b>CEN</b> 6 functional <b>sequences</b> encompass these AT-rich stretches because this part shows striking similarities to sequence elements common to CEN 3 and CEN 11 DNA.

40|$|A linear plasmid {{containing}} ARS 1, CEN 4, and 48 bp of vertebrate (T(2) AG(3)) telomeric sequences at {{each end}} was used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Only circular plasmids that had lost the centromere and had retained the T(2) AG(3) sequences were obtained, indicating that the vertebrate T(2) AG(3) sequences and the yeast CEN 4 could not be simultaneously present in this vector. This hypothesis was verified by removing the <b>CEN</b> 4 <b>sequence</b> from the construct. In fact, the resulting transformants contained two classes of efficiently replicating linear plasmids: one of the expected size and one about twice as large. During subsequent growth, plasmids of the former, but not latter, class were subjected to concatemer formation.

Such nematode segments conferred ARS function to the plasmid, as judged by an increased frequency of transformation compared with control plasmids without ARS function.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{centromere}} {{region of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III {{has been replaced}} by various DNA fragments from the centromere regions of yeast chromosomes III and Xl. A 289 -base pair centromere (<b>CEN</b> 3) <b>sequence</b> can stabilize yeast chromosome III through mitosis and meiosis.

40|$|The <b>CEN</b> 4 <b>sequences</b> from {{chromosome}} 4 that impart mitotic {{stability to}} autonomously replicating (ARS) plasmids in yeast cells have been localized to a 1, 755 -base-pair (bp) fragment.

One of the half-fragments worked as efficiently as the larger fragment from which it was derived, while the other half provided a much poorer degree of mitotic stabilization.

The poorly stabilizing half-fragment did not contain any obvious sequence homologies to other centromere sequences.

40|$|Centromeres on {{chromosomes}} in {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain approximately 140 base pairs (bp) of DNA. The functional centromere (CEN) region contains three important sequence elements (I, PuTCACPuTG; II, 78 to 86 bp of high-AT DNA; and III, a conserved 25 -bp sequence with internal bilateral symmetry). Various point mutations or deletions in the element III region {{have a profound}} effect on CEN function in vivo, indicating that this DNA region is a key protein-binding site. This has been confirmed by the use of two in vitro assays to detect binding of yeast proteins to DNA fragments containing wild-type or mutationally altered <b>CEN</b> 3 <b>sequences.</b> An exonuclease III protection assay was used to demonstrate specific binding of proteins to the element III region of CEN 3. In addition, a gel DNA fragment mobility shift assay was used to characterize the binding reaction parameters. Sequence element III mutations that inactivate CEN function in vivo also prevent binding of proteins in the in vitro assays. The mobility shift assay indicates that double-stranded DNAs containing sequence element III efficiently bind proteins in the absence of sequence elements I and II, although the latter sequences are essential for optimal CEN function in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Centromere DNA element II (CDEII) of {{budding yeast}} centromeres is an AT-rich {{sequence}} essential for centromere (<b>CEN)</b> function. <b>Sequence</b> analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDEIIs revealed that A 5 – 7 /T 5 – 7 tracts are statistically overrepresented {{at the expense}} of AA/TT and alternating AT. To test the hypothesis that this nonrandom sequence organization is functionally important, a CEN library in which the CDEII sequences were randomized was generated. The library was screened for functional and nonfunctional members following centromere replacement in vivo. Functional CENs contained CDEIIs with the highly biased An/Tn run distribution of native centromeres, while nonfunctional CDEIIs resembled those picked from the library at random. Run content, defined as the fraction of residues present in runs of four or more nucleotides, of the functional and nonfunctional CDEII populations differed significantly (P < 0. 001). Computer searches of the genome for regions with an A + T content comparable to CDEIIs revealed that such loci are not unique to centromeres, but for 14 of the 16 chromosomes the AT-rich locus with the highest An≥ 4 + Tn≥ 4 run content was the centromere.

40|$|Centromeres are {{important}} chromosomal regions necessary for eukaryotic cell segregation and replication. Due to high amounts of tandem repeats and transposons, centromeres {{have been difficult}} to sequence in most multicellular organisms, thus their sequence structure and evolution are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed transposons in the centromere 8 (Cen 8) from the African cultivated rice (O. glaberrima) and two subspecies of the Asian cultivated rice (O. sativa), indica and japonica. We detected much higher transposon contents (> 69 %) in centromere regions than in the whole genomes of O. sativa ssp japonica and O. glaberrima (~ 35 %). We compared the three Cen 8 s and identified numerous recent insertions of transposons that were frequently organized into multiple-layer nested blocks, similar to nested transposons in maize. Except for the Hopi retrotransposon, all LTR retrotransposons were shared but exhibit different abundances amongst the three Cen 8 s. Even though a majority of the transposons were located in intergenic regions, some gene-related transposons were found and may be involved in gene diversification. Chromatin immunoprecipitated (ChIP) data analysis revealed that 165 families from both Class I and Class II transposons were found in CENH 3 -associated chromatin sequences. These results indicate essential roles for transposons in centromeres and that the rapid divergence of the <b>Cen</b> 8 <b>sequences</b> between the two cultivated rice species was primarily caused by recent transposon insertions...|$|R

Thirteen different centromere (CEN) mutations were tested for their effects on meiotic centromere function. YACs containing a wild-type <b>CEN</b> DNA <b>sequence</b> segregate with high fidelity in meiosis I (99 % normal segregation) and in meiosis II (96 % normal segregation). YACs containing a 31 -bp deletion mutation in centromere DNA element II (CDEIIδ 31) in either a heterocentric (mutant/wild type), homocentric (mutant/mutant) or monosomic (mutant/ [...] ) YAC pair configuration exhibited high levels (16 - 28 %) of precocious sister-chromatid segregation (PSS) and increased levels (1 - 6 %) of nondisjunction meiosis I (NDI). YACs containing this mutation also exhibit high levels (21 %) of meiosis II nondisjunction. Interestingly, significant alterations in homolog recombination frequency were observed in the exceptional PSS class of tetrads, suggesting unusual interactions between prematurely separated sister chromatids and their homologous nonsister chromatids. We also have assessed the meiotic segregation effects of rare gene conversion events occurring at sites located immediately adjacent to or distantly from the centromere region. Proximal gene conversion events were associated with extremely high levels (60 %) of meiosis I segregation errors (including both PSS and NDI), whereas distal events had no apparent effect. Taken together, our results indicate a critical role for CDEII in meiosis and underscore the importance of maintaining sister-chromatid cohesion for proper recombination in meiotic prophase and for proper disjunction in meiosis I...|$|R
40|$|A {{centromere}} (CEN) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{consists of}} approximately 150 bp of DNA and contains 3 conserved sequence elements: a high A + T region 78 - 86 bp in length (element II), flanked {{on the left}} by a conserved 8 -bp element I sequence (PuTCACPuTG), and on the right by a conserved 25 -bp element III sequence. We have carried out a structure-function analysis of the element I and II regions of CEN 3 by constructing mutations in these sequences and subsequently determining their effect on mitotic and meiotic chromosome segregation. We have also examined the mitotic and meiotic segregation behavior of ARS plasmids containing the structurally altered <b>CEN</b> 3 <b>sequences.</b> Replacing the periodic tracts of A residues within element II with random A + T sequences of equal length increases the frequency of mitotic chromosome nondisjunction only 4 -fold; whereas, reducing the A + T content of element II while preserving the length results in a 40 -fold increase in the frequence of chromosome nondisjunction. Structural alterations in the element II region that do not decrease the overall length have {{little effect on the}} meiotic segregation behavior of the altered chromosomes. Centromeres containing a deletion of element I or a portion of element II retain considerable mitotic activity, yet plasmids carrying these same mutations segregate randomly during meiosis I, indicating these sequences to be essential for maintaining attachment of the replicated sister chromatids during the first meiotic division. The presence of an intact element I sequence properly spaced from the element III region is absolutely essential for proper meiotic function of the centromere...|$|R
40|$|A {{circular}} minichromosome carrying functional centromere <b>sequences</b> (<b>cen</b> 2) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe chromosome II behaves as a stable, independent {{genetic linkage}} group in S. pombe. The cen 2 region {{was found to}} be organized into four large tandemly repeated sequence units which span over 80 kilobase pairs (kb) of untranscribed DNA. Two of these units occurred in a 31 -kb inverted repeat that flanked a 7 -kb central core of nonhomology. The inverted repeat region had centromere function, but neither the central core alone nor one arm of the inverted repeat was functional. Deletion of a portion of the repeated sequences that flank the central core had no effect on mitotic segregation functions or on meiotic segregation of a minichromosome to two of the four haploid progeny, but drastically impaired centromere-mediated maintenance of sister chromatid attachment in meiosis I. This requirement for centromere-specific repeated sequences could not be satisfied by introduction of random DNA sequences. These observations suggest a function for the heterochromatic repeated DNA sequences found in the centromere regions of higher eucaryotes...|$|R
40|$|Circular {{plasmids}} containing an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) and a centromeric DNA <b>sequence</b> (<b>CEN)</b> segregate {{as independent}} linkage groups during meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. If two genetically marked plasmids {{are present in}} the same diploid cell, their segregation during meiosis may be determined relative to each other. It has been observed that for centromere plasmids containing some DNA sequences in common, these plasmids tend to segregate away from each other at the first meiotic division [Clarke, L. & Carbon, J. (1980) Nature (London) 287, 504 - 509; Clarke, L., Fitzgerald-Hayes, M., Buhler, J. -M. & Carbon, J. (1981) Stadler Genet. Symp. 13, 9 - 23]. Here we show that nonhomologous plasmids, having no detectable DNA sequence cross-hybridization, also tend to disjoin from each other at the first meiotic division. Therefore, this nonrandom segregation to opposite poles can occur by mechanisms that do not involve DNA sequence homology. This process may be an active nonhomologous pairing system or it may reflect unknown physical restraints on the meiotic segregation of the two plasmids. In either case, this process cannot be used as a possible assay for homologous meiotic pairing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{have taken}} {{advantage}} of the known structural parameters associated with centromere DNA in vivo to construct a CEN fragment that can be selectively excised from the chromatin DNA with restriction endonucleases. CEN 3 DNA is organized in chromatin such that a 220 - 250 -bp region encompassing the elements of centromere homology is resistant to nuclease digestion. Restriction enzyme linkers encoding the Bam HI-recognition site were ligated to a 289 base pair DNA segment that spans the 220 - 250 -bp protected core (Bloom et al., 1984). Replacement of this CEN 3 -Bam HI linker cassette into a chromosome or plasmid results in formation of a complete structural and functional centromeric unit. A centromere core complex that retains its protected chromatin conformation can be selectively excised from intact nuclei by restriction with the enzyme Barn HI. The centromeric protein-DNA complex is therefore not dependent upon the intact torsional constraints on linear chromosomes for its structural integrity. Isolation of this complex provides a novel approach to characterizing authentic centromeric proteins bound to DNA in their native state. T HE centromere region functions as a cis-acting element for chromosomal segregation in both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Specific centromeric DNA <b>sequences</b> (<b>CEN)</b> are required in cis for proper chromosomal transmission during cell growth. The sequence requirements have been investigated by altering DNA in vitro and determining CEN function in an in vivo assay for chromosomal stability (Carbo...|$|R
40|$|Circular {{plasmids}} in yeast carrying only an {{origin of}} DNA replication (ARS) exhibit maternal inheritance bias (MIB) and are poorly transmitted from mother to daughter cell during division. A {{variety of different}} sequences that overcome MIB have been described, including centromeric <b>sequences</b> (<b>CEN),</b> telomere-associated repeats, silencer sequences and a specific system encoded by the endogenous 2 μm circle plasmid requiring the cis-acting locus STB and the proteins Rep 1 and Rep 2. In each case, DNA segregation between mother and daughter cells is dependent on DNA-protein interactions. Using plasmids carrying multiple copies of a lac repressor binding sequence, we have localised DNA molecules in the yeast nucleus using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) -lac repressor fusion protein. We compared GFP localised plasmids carrying a centromere sequence with plasmids based on 2 μm circle carrying or lacking the STB sequences required for their segregation. We show that GFP localised plasmid carrying the complete STB locus co-localises with the plasmid proteins Rep 1 and Rep 2 to discrete chromatin sites. These sites are distinct from both the telomeres and from sites of cohesin binding. Deletion of the region of STB essential for {{the stability of the}} plasmid, leads to a loss of plasmid association with chromatin, relocalisation of plasmids towards the nuclear periphery, and a decrease in the Rep 1 protein associated with the plasmid. We conclude that specific plasmid localisation is likely to be important in the overcoming of MIB in yeast...|$|R
