40|$|Ransomware is {{currently}} the key threat for individual as well as corporate Internet users. Especially dangerous is <b>crypto</b> <b>ransomware</b> that encrypts important user data {{and it is only}} possible to recover it once a ransom has been paid. Therefore devising efficient and effective countermeasures is a rising necessity. In this paper we present a novel Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based detection approach that utilizes characteristics of ransomware communication. Based on the observation of network communication of two <b>crypto</b> <b>ransomware</b> families, namely CryptoWall and Locky we conclude that analysis of the HTTP messages' sequences and their respective content sizes is enough to detect such threats. We show feasibility of our approach by designing and evaluating the proof-of-concept SDN-based detection system. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is feasible and efficient.

40|$|Emergence of crypto-ransomware has {{significantly}} changed the cyber threat landscape. A <b>crypto</b> <b>ransomware</b> removes data custodian access by encrypting valuable data on victimsâ€™ computers and requests a ransom payment to reinstantiate custodian access by decrypting data. Timely detection of ransomware very {{much depends on}} how quickly and accurately system logs can be mined to hunt abnormalities and stop the evil. In this paper we first setup an environment to collect activity logs of 517 Locky ransomware samples, 535 Cerber ransomware samples and 572 samples of TeslaCrypt ransomware. We utilize Sequential Pattern Mining to find Maximal Frequent Patterns (MFP) of activities within different ransomware families as candidate features for classification using J 48, Random Forest, Bagging and MLP algorithms. We could achieve 99...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{different}} forms of ransomware are increasingly threatening Internet users. Modern ransomware encrypts important user data {{and it is only}} possible to recover it once a ransom has been paid. In this paper we show how Software-Defined Networking (SDN) can be utilized to improve ransomware mitigation. In more detail, we analyze the behavior of popular ransomware - CryptoWall - and, based on this knowledge, we propose two real-time mitigation methods. Then we designed the SDN-based system, implemented using OpenFlow, which facilitates a timely reaction to this threat, and is a crucial factor in the case of <b>crypto</b> <b>ransomware.</b> What is important is that such a design does not significantly affect overall network performance. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is feasible and efficient. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
