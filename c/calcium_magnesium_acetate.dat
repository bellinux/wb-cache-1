40|$|Small-column ion {{exchange}} (SCIX) units installed in high-level waste tanks to remove Cs- 137 from highly alkaline salt solutions {{are among the}} waste treatment plans in the DOE-complex. Spherical Resorcinol-Formaldehyde (sRF) is the {{ion exchange}} resin selected {{for use in the}} Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). It is also the primary ion exchange material under consideration for SCIX at the Hanford site. The elution step of the multi-step ion exchange process is typically done with 0. 5 M nitric acid. An acid eluant is a potential hazard {{in the event of a}} spill, leak, etc. because the high-level waste tanks are made of carbon steel. Corrosion and associated structural damage may ensue. A study has been conducted to explore non-acid elution as an alternative. Batch contact sorption equilibrium screening tests have been conducted with 36 potential non-acid eluants. The sorption tests involve equilibrating each cesium-containing eluant solution with the sRF resin for 48 hours at 25 C in a shaker oven. In the sorption tests, an eluant is deemed to have a high cesium elution potential if it minimizes cesium sorption onto the sRF resin. The top candidates (based on lowest cesium sorption distribution coefficients) include ammonium carbonate, ammonium carbonate/ammonium hydroxide, ammonium bicarbonate, rubidium carbonate, ammonium acetate, ammonium acetate/ammonium hydroxide, ammonium bicarbonate/ammonium hydroxide, <b>calcium</b> chloride, and <b>magnesium</b> chloride. A select few of the top candidate eluants from the screening tests were subjected to actual sorption (loading) and elution tests to confirm their elution ability. The actual sorption (loading) and elution tests mimicked the typical sRF-cesium ion exchange process (i. e., sorption or loading, caustic wash, water rinse, and elution) via batch contact sorption and quasi column caustic wash/water rinse/elution. The eluants tested included ammonium carbonate, ammonium <b>acetate,</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>acetate,</b> <b>magnesium</b> <b>acetate,</b> and nitric acid. <b>Calcium</b> <b>acetate</b> and <b>magnesium</b> <b>acetate</b> were substitutes for <b>calcium</b> chloride and <b>magnesium</b> chloride respectively due to corrosion concerns. Nitric acid was selected for benchmarking since it is the baseline cesium eluant for sRF resin. The cesium elution performance of ammonium carbonate and ammonium acetate was approximately the same as the benchmark eluant, nitric acid. Ninety-seven (97), 94, and 100 % percent of the cesium sorbed or loaded were eluted by ammonium carbonate, ammonium acetate, and nitric acid was respectively.

Benchmarking of <b>calcium</b> <b>magnesium</b> <b>acetate</b> with a suite of five other carboxylic salts (<b>calcium</b> <b>magnesium</b> <b>acetate,</b> calcium propionate, calcium acetate, calcium benzoate, magnesium acetate, and calcium formate) has been performed. NOx reduction involves the volatile organic content of the carboxylic salt being released at temperatures of > 1000 °C, where the reaction of CHi radicals with NO under fuel-rich conditions can result {{in some of the}} NO forming N 2 in a “reburning” process. Thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) studies identified the nature of the decomposition products from the low- and high-temperature decompositions.

In-furnace reductions of SO 2 and HCl are aided by the highly porous, particulate residue, which results from the in situ drying, pyrolysis, and calcination processes. Simultaneous reduction of all three pollutants was obtained, and a synergy between SO 2 and HCl capture was identified. A mechanism for this inter-relationship has been proposed.

40|$|Sodium formate, {{potassium}} acetate and {{a mixture of}} <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> <b>acetate</b> (CMA) have all been identified as effective de-icing agents. In this project an attempt {{has been made to}} elucidate potentially deleterious effects of these substances on the durability of reinforced concrete. Aspects involving the corrosion behaviour of embedded steel along with the chemical and physical degradation of the cementitious matrix were studied. Ionic diffusion characteristics of deicer/pore solution systems in hardened cement paste were also studied since rates of ingress of deleterious agents into cement paste are commonly diffusion-controlled. It was found that all the compounds tested were generally non-corrosive to embedded steel, however, in a small number of cases {{potassium acetate}} did cause corrosion. Potassium acetate was also found to cause cracking in concrete and cement paste samples. CMA appeared to degrade hydrated cement paste although this was apparently less of a problem when commercial grade CMA was used in place of the reagent grade chemical. This was thought to be due to the insoluble material present in the commercial formulation forming a physical barrier between the concrete and the de-icing solution. With the test regimes used sodium formate was not seen to have any deleterious effect on the integrity of reinforced concrete. As a means of restoring the corrosion protective character of chloride-contaminated concrete the process of electrochemical chloride removal has been previously developed. Potential side-effects of this method and the effect of external electrolyte composition on chloride removal efficiency were investigated. It was seen that the composition of the external electrolyte has a significant effect on the amount of chloride removed. It was also found that, due to alterations to the composition of the C 3 A hydration reaction products, it was possible to remove bound chloride as well as that in the pore solution. The use of an external electrolyte containing lithium ions was also tried as a means of preventing cathodically-induced alkali-silica reaction in concretes containing potentially reactive aggregates.

40|$|Research {{to develop}} tests that can {{accurately}} predict {{the effects of}} deicing chemicals on the corrosion of steel in reinforced concrete structures is reported. The research includes the development and evaluation of a standard test specimen {{and the use of}} three deicing chemicals to determine the sensitivity of both corrosion potential and macrocell corrosion to molal ion con-centrations ranging from 0. 4 to 6. 4. The standard test specimen consists of a No. 4 reinforcing bar embedded in a 1. 18 in. (30 mm) diameter, 4 in. (100 mm) long mortar cylinder. The mortar is made using portland cement, deionized water, and standard graded Ottawa sand. Specimens cured in lime-saturated water reach a passive condition within 14 days. The tests are easy to perform, require no special training, and can normally be completed within 60 days. Of the two tests, the corrosion potential test provides more consistent results and should prove to be a useful tool for comparing the effects of deicing chemicals on the corrosion of reinforcing steel.
