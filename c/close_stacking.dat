The quantum dash VCSEL laser polarization appears stable on the whole sample and with excitation, no switching is observed.

40|$|We studied ten-fold stacked {{layers of}} self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots by {{photoluminescence}} in pulsed magnetic fields. When the interlayer distance is reduced from 9. 8 to 5. 5 nm, {{a doubling of}} the diamagnetic shift for a magnetic field perpendicular to the [0 0 1] direction reveals the onset of electron coupling between the dots in the stack. On reducing the interlayer distance to 3. 1 nm, a lower exciton effective mass is seen {{in addition to the}} coupling. For such a <b>close</b> <b>stacking,</b> the strain field in and around the dot is completely different from that of a single-layered structure. In particular, the strain inside the InAs dots in the stack is partially relaxed, causing the observed effect. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} growth, {{characterization}} and device applications of self-assembled InAs/InP(1 0 0) quantum dots (QDs) formed by MOVPE. The problematic As/P exchange reaction during QD growth is suppressed by {{the insertion of}} a GaAs interlayer together with optimum growth conditions. This produces QDs with continuously tunable emission over the 1. 55 -µm wavelength region for fiber-based telecom applications. Device quality of these QDs is proven by continuous wave lasing at room temperature from the as-cleaved facets of Fabry–Pérot narrow ridge-waveguide lasers implementing widely stacked QDs as gain medium. The low transparency current density of 6 A/cm 2 per QD layer and low loss of 4. 2 cm- 1 are accompanied by a 80 -nm wide gain spectrum. The deeply etched QD lasers possess similar threshold current densities as the shallowly etched ones and do not deteriorate with time, revealing that device performance does not suffer from sidewall recombination. This allows the fabrication of mono-mode and more compact devices with small bending radii, {{as demonstrated by the}} operation of a QD ring laser with 40 -GHz free spectral range. Unpolarized emission from the cleaved side, important for the realization of polarization insensitive semiconductor optical amplifiers, is obtained by <b>close</b> <b>stacking</b> of QDs due to vertical electronic coupling. Sharp exciton–biexciton emission from a single QD around 1. 55 µm is observed with clearly resolvable peaks above 70 K, which is required for single photon sources working at liquid nitrogen temperature for fiber-based quantum cryptography systems...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential of pre-treatment techniques to produce high quality back-sawn boards from regrowth messmate stringybark (Eucalyptus obliqua L'Herit), which is very prone to collapse and checking. Saturated urea solution, one percent sodium hydroxide, four percent acetic acid, water, urea formaldehyde resin (UF), and polyvinyl acetate glue (PVA) were used. In Chapter 4, the experiment of chemical soaking pre-treatments showed that soaking in sodium hydroxide solution for up to 15 days caused almost double increase of boards' drying rate. However, this technique and soaking in acetic acid solution caused more collapse and checks. In Chapter 5 and 6, the surface coating experiment confirmed that coating with UF resin did not significantly improve the drying properties of the boards. In contrast, PVA coating prevented surface checking and considerably reduced edge checking and collapse. The check value of these P boards was only a quarter the check value of control boards. In Chapter 6, the pre-treatments trial proved that significant reductions of shrinkage and collapse were achieved mainly by urea soaking for eight weeks (SSW boards). Both tangential and radial shrinkages of S 8 W boards were {{less than half the}} shrinkages of control boards. The collapse free boards of S 8 W were almost double amount of that in control boards. However, this pretreatment caused more surface checks. One-day urea soaking followed by eight weeks <b>close</b> <b>stacking</b> (C treatment) reduced checking.

40|$|Single-use-technologies (SUT) are a {{category}} of disposable bioprocessing components which have increased in popularity in the biopharmaceutical industry in recent years [1]. Stirred single use bioreactors use a polymeric bag supported by a rigid metal frame. The bag is disposed of and replaced after use, removing the need for energy-intensive and time consuming cleaning and sterilisation in place, as well as improving {{the flexibility of the}} production facility [2]. They are currently applied mainly to the production of vaccines by mammalian cell cultures [3] due to the low shear and oxygen requirements when compared to industrial fermentation processes. This work is part of a PhD project which aims to produce a validated CFD model of multiphase gas-liquid mixing in a cubic SUT bioreactor. This geometry is preferred due to the high bag integrity and simplicity over existing cylindrical SUT bioreactors. A magnetically-driven floor mounted impeller is also included in order to further simplify the geometry and allow for the <b>close</b> <b>stacking</b> of multiple bags. Multiphase modelling in a 1 m 3 vessel has been performed using the commercial software ANSYS CFX at a range of stirrer speeds and gas flow-rates in an attempt to optimise conditions in the reactor for oxygen mass transfer. Turbulence is modelled using the k-ε model, with impeller motion modelled using the multiple reference frame method. Five different models for the mass transfer coefficient, kL¬, which are suitable for calculation from CFD derived parameters such as turbulent eddy dissipation and superficial gas velocity, are compared. An optimum stirrer speed of 400 RPM was identified, above which the mass transfer - characterised by kL¬¬¬a values - is not improved despite the additional power input. A proposed 200 L variation of this cubic design was also investigated, showing significantly improved gas mass transfer. Validation of the models is performed in a separate lab-scale cubic glass tank, with point velocity measurements taken using two-dimensional Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA). These measurements are combined to create profiles within the vessel which are compared to a CFD model of the same geometry. Three impeller types are used for the validation experiments; a six-bladed Rushton impeller, a four-bladed radial impeller and a four-bladed axial impeller. Validation experiments are currently performed in single-phase, however the process will be expanded to cover multiphase gas-liquid systems including both liquid-phase velocity and bubble size distribution measurements. A good agreement is observed between the modelled and experimental profiles in-line with the impeller, in particular the swirling flow patterns characterised by the tangential velocity. [1] A. G.
