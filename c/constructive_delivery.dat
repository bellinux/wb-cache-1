If the gift is of a type that cannot {{be delivered}} in the conventional sense - a house, or a bank account - the delivery can be effected by a <b>constructive</b> <b>delivery,</b> wherein a tangible item allowing access to the gift - a deed or key to the house, a passbook for the bank account - is delivered instead. Symbolic delivery is also sometimes permissible where manual delivery is impractical, such as the delivery of a key that does not open anything, but is intended to symbolize the transfer of ownership.|$|E

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIIntroduction: Self-determination theory postulates {{that the}} three basic {{psychological}} needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness have to be satisfied for students to achieve intrinsic motivation and internalisation of autonomous self-regulation towards academic activities. Consequently, {{the influence of the}} clinical teaching environment becomes crucial when satisfying these needs, particularly when promoting or diminishing students’ intrinsic motivation. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe and understand how clinical teachers encourage intrinsic motivation in undergraduate dental students based on the three basic psychological needs described by the self-determination theory. Methods: A qualitative case study approach was adopted, and data were collected through semistructured interviews with nine experienced undergraduate clinical teachers of one dental school in Santiago, Chile. Interview transcripts were analysed by two independent reviewers using a general inductive approach. Findings: Several themes emerged outlining teaching strategies and behaviours. These themes included the control of external motivators; gradual transference of responsibility; identification and encouragement of personal interests; timely and <b>constructive</b> feedback; <b>delivery</b> of a vicarious learning experience; teamwork, team discussion, and presence of a safe environment, amongst others. Overall, teachers stressed the relevance of empowering, supporting and building a horizontal relationship with students. Conclusions: Our findings regarding dental education expand on the research outcomes from other health professions about how teachers may support students to internalise behaviours. An autonomy-supportive environment may lead students to value and engage in academic activities and eventually foster the use of an autonomysupportive style to motivate their patients...|$|R
40|$|Thinking {{differently}} about complaints in the NHS NHS complaints have been both the precipitant and subject of numerous recent reports, inquiries and investigations. They are viewed and {{treated as a}} wholly negative aspect of NHS activity and consume signifi cant resource and time {{in addition to the}} emotional impact on both patients and staff. Currently the stance taken by NHS providers is defensive and process-driven with little attention to the subject of the complaint and how this might provide useful and <b>constructive</b> information (<b>delivery</b> model). With much focus on patient experience and how this can be improved, complaints, if incorporated into a much bigger framework encompassing patient feedback, satisfaction and experience, could be used to constructively develop and shape healthcare delivery. Use of complaints to inform experience based co-design and collaboration could transform some healthcare services for the benefi t of patients and healthcare professionals (relational model). The NHS must learn how to effectively harness patient feedback, including complaints through all available channels: written, verbal and via electronic media. Limited resources mean not everyone can have the treatment they want or need when and where they want or need it and in building an anticipatory approach to complaints by making it easy for patients by inviting feedback, good and bad, training staff to act appropriately and thinking differently by seeing complaints as an opportunity rather than a threat, could contribute to driving improvement across healthcare and making the NHS the high performing organisation it aspires to be...|$|R
40|$|In this article, Craig Anderson {{examines}} the historical origins and current {{law of the}} Scottish rules concerning how delivery of goods {{in the custody of}} a third party may be validly effected by transferor to transferee. The author suggests that the form of <b>constructive</b> <b>delivery</b> permitted by law is best analysed as an assignation of the transferor's personal right against the custodier. On this argument, the custodier then ceases to hold the goods for the transferor and begins to hold them for the transferee. As a result, the transferee acquires civil possession of the goods and delivery is complete...|$|E

40|$|The {{delivery}} means {{the transfer of}} possession of property from one person, seller, to another, buyer. The seller delivers goods to buyer if he delivers them physically, if he makes symbolic delivery by delivering document of title to them (e. g. a bill of landing) or other means of control over them (e. g. the keys of warehouse {{in which they are}} stored), or if a third party who is holding them acknowledges that he now holds them for the buyers. In <b>constructive</b> <b>delivery,</b> the seller agrees that he holds the goods on behalf of the buyer his possession of the goods under a hire-purchase agreement and becomes owner on making the final payment. Goods may be 'pledged' (or 'pawned'). In this case the pledge (pawnee) acquires possession of them. The delivery of possession in the case of pledge, may be physically and symbolic on the same way as transfer of property. The difference is the constitutum possessorium delivery...|$|E
40|$|Micro-economic {{reform is}} a primary {{objective}} of modern Australian socio-economic policy. The key outcome targetted by this reform is increased efficiency, measured by a range of factors, including cost reduction, increased savings, and a more facilitative environment for business activity. These benefits are sought by the proponents of reform {{as part of a}} push to increase national prosperity, but concerns that social equity is undermined by it are expressed by opponents of that reform. The debate between efficiency and equity is raging in current Australian tax policy, a key site for micro-economic reform. As Government Budget restructuring occurs in Australia, demographic change (eg, the ageing population) undermines the ability of public funded welfare to provide retirement benefits. Responsibility for self-funded retirement is an important contributor to increasing private savings. Investment in growth assets such as corporate stock is increasing in Australia, however concerns about volatility of asset values and yield stimulate the importance of investment risk management techniques. Financial contract innovation utilising financial derivatives is a dominant mechanism for that risk management. Synthetic equity products which are characterised by capital protection and enhanced yield are popular and efficient equity risk management vehicles, and are observed globally, particularly in the North American market. Financial contract innovation, risk management using financial derivatives, and synthetic equity products suffer from an adverse tax regulatory response in Australia, which deprives Australian investors from access to important savings vehicles. The negative Australian tax response stems from anachronistic legislation and jurisprudence, which emphasises tax outcomes based on legal form. The pinnacle of this approach is the tax law insistence on characterisation of financial contracts as either debt or equity, despite some important financial similarities between these two asset types. Since derivatives produce transactions with novel legal forms this approach is unresponsive to innovation. The negative tax result also stems from a perception that the new products are tax arbitrage vehicles, offering tax benefits properly available to investment in stocks, which is thought to be inappropriate when the new products resemble debt positions (particularly when they are capital protected and yield enhanced). The negative tax response reflects administrative concerns about taxpayer equity and revenue leakage. This approach seeks to impose tax linearity by proxy: rather than utilising systemic reform to align the tax treatment of debt and equity, the current strategy simply denies the equity tax benefits to a variety of innovative financial contracts. It deprives Australians of efficiency enhancing savings products, which because of an adverse tax result are unattractive to investors. The weakness of the current approach is illustrated by critical analysis of three key current and proposed tax laws: the debt dividend rules in sec. 46 D Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (the Tax Act); the 1997 Budget measures (which seek to integrate related stock and derivative positions); and the proposals in the Taxation of Financial Arrangements Issues Paper (which include a market value tax accounting treatment for traded equity, and propose a denial of the tax benefits for risk managed equity investments). The thesis develops a model for financial analysis of synthetic equity products to verify the efficiency claims made for them. The approach is described as the Tax ReValue model. The Tax ReValue approach isolates the enhanced investment returns possible for synthetic equity, and the model is tested by application to the leading Australian synthetic equity product, the converting preference share. The conclusions reached are that the converting preference share provides the key benefits of enhanced investment return and lower capital costs to its corporate issuer. This financial efficiency analysis is relied upon to support the assertion that a facilitative tax response to such products is appropriate. The facilitative response can be delivered by a reformulation of the existing tax rules, or by systemic reform. The reformulation of the existing tax rules is articulated by a Rule of Reason, which is proposed in the thesis {{as the basis for the}} allocation and retention of the equity tax benefits. To avoid concerns about taxpayer equity and revenue leakage the Rule of Reason proposes a Two Step approach to the allocation of the equity tax benefits to synthetics. The financial analysis is used to quantify non-tax benefits of synthetic equity products, and to predict whether and to what extent the security performs financially like debt or equity. This financial analysis is overlayed by a refined technical legal appraisal of whether the security contains the essential legal Badges of Equity.  The resulting form and substance approach provides a fair and equitable control mechanism for perceived tax arbitrage, whilst facilitating efficient financial contract innovation. The ultimate source of non-linearity in the taxation of investment capital is the differential tax benefits provided to equity and debt. To promote tax linearity the differentiation needs to be removed, and the thesis makes recommendations for systemic reform, particularly concerning the introduction of a system of Franked Debt.  The proposed system of Franked Debt would align the tax treatment of debt and equity by replacing the corporate interest deduction tax benefit with a lender credit in respect of corporate tax paid. This credit would operate mechanically like the existing shareholder imputation credit. The interface of this domestic tax credit scheme with the taxation of International investment capital, and the problems occasioned by <b>constructive</b> <b>delivery</b> of franking credits to Australian taxpayers via synthetics, are resolved by the design and costings of the new system, which has the potential to be revenue positive...|$|E
