We show that the generality of Beltway enables us to design and implement new collectors that are robust to variations in heap size and improve total execution time over the best generational copying collectors of which we are aware by up to 40 %, and on average by 5 to 10 %, for small to moderate heap sizes. New garbage collection algorithms are rare, and yet we define not just one, but a new family of collectors that subsumes previous work.

40|$|The {{study of}} quadrupeds has {{furnished}} {{most of our}} understanding of mammalian locomotion. To allow a more direct comparison of coordination between the four limbs in humans and quadrupeds, we studied crawling in the human, a behavior {{that is part of}} normal human development and mechanically more similar to quadrupedal locomotion than is bipedal walking. Interlimb coordination during hands-and-knees crawling is compared between humans and quadrupeds and between human infants and adults. Mechanical factors were manipulated during crawling to understand the relative contributions of mechanics and neural control. Twenty-six infants and seven adults were studied. Video, force plate, and electrogoniometer data were <b>collected.</b> <b>Belt</b> speed of the treadmill, width of base, and limb length were manipulated in adults. Influences of unweighting and limb length were explored in infants. Infants tended to move diagonal limbs together (trot-like). Adults additionally moved ipsilateral limbs together (pace-like). At lower speeds, movements of the four limbs were more equally spaced in time, with no clear pairing of limbs. At higher speeds, running symmetrical gaits were never observed, although one adult galloped. Widening stance prevented adults from using the pace-like gait, whereas lengthening the hind limbs (hands-and-feet crawling) largely prevented the trot-like gait. Limb length and unweighting had no effect on coordination in infants. We conclude that human crawling shares features both with other primates and with nonprimate quadrupeds, suggesting similar underlying mechanisms. The greater restriction in coordination patterns used by infants suggests their nervous system has less flexibility...|$|R

40|$|The abundance, trophic {{composition}} {{and diversity of}} fish were investigated in the Mombasa Marine Protected Area (MPA) on the Kenya coast {{over a period of}} four years (2004 - 2007) sixteen years after its establishment to determine its effectiveness. Fish monitoring data <b>collected</b> using <b>belt</b> transects revealed significant differences in fish abundance, distribution and composition between the MPA’s no-take area and a partially-protected area with controlled exploitation. Although seasonal variation was apparent in the trophic composition, annual differences over the four year study period were not significant. Results indicated that differences in fish composition within the MPA were due to a greater abundance of haemulids (nocturnal carnivores) and acanthurids (herbivores) in the no-take area than in the partially-protected area. Fish diversity also varied between the no-take area and the partially-protected area with a higher Shannon-Wiener diversity index associated with the no-take area. Dominance was higher in the partially-protected area than in the no-take area and was also higher during the southeast (SE) monsoon season. These results support the claim of greater effectiveness of the fully protected no-take area, compared to the partially-protected area in sustaining the rich fish community found in previous studies...|$|R

Samples were <b>collected</b> in <b>belts</b> of Sphagnum, Phragmites, Carex, Utricularia, and Calliergonella. Sampling was done on a monthly basis from Apr. to Nov. 2009. Comparisons of species numbers, abundances, and biomass levels of testate amoebae and ciliates between Sphagnum mosses did not show statistically significant differences. In carbonate fens, the average species numbers, abundances, and biomass levels of testate amoebae and ciliates for Sphagnum, Calliergonella, and Utricularia were higher than those for Phragmites and Carex. Based on differences in plant stem structure, 2 groups of habitats were distinguished. The 1 st group consisted of 2 vegetated zones with a sparse stem structure (Phragmites and Carex), while the 2 nd group consisted of plant species with a decidedly more-complicated structure (Sphagnum, Calliergonella, and Utricularia). The results demonstrated that water table depth, pH, and concentrations of total phosphorus and total organic carbon strongly regulated the taxonomic composition and abundances of protozoa. Rates of excretion of ammonia-nitrogen and phosphate-phosphorus proportionally decreased with an increase in body weight.

Thus the point where the image disappears is like the pinhole of the window.

The aim was to quantify kinematics of child occupants during swerving maneuvers focusing on the child’s lateral movement and seat belt position relative to the child’s shoulder. A study was conducted on a closed-circuit test track with 16 children aged 4 - 12, restrained in the rear seat of a modern passenger vehicle. A professional driving instructor drove at 50 km/h making sharp turns in a repeatable fashion, resulting in inboard motion of the children. The children were exposed to two turns in each of two restraint systems. Shorter children were on a booster or highback booster cushion. The taller children were seated on a booster cushion or with only a lap and shoulder seat belt. Four film cameras were fixed in the vehicle monitoring the child. Vehicle data were also <b>collected.</b> The seat <b>belt</b> slipped off the shoulder in 1 of 5 turns, varying by age and restraint type. Among shorter children, the belt slipped off in a majority of turns when seated on a booster cushion while the belt remained on the shoulder when seated on the highback booster cushion. Among taller children, the shoulder belt moved far laterally on the shoulder in half of the turns.

40|$|The {{progressive}} metamorphism and {{origin of}} the amphibolites of the Lead-Deadwood area, S. Dakota, are considered in detail. Eighty specimens of amphibolite were <b>collected</b> along a <b>belt</b> 3 miles long extending across the entire garnet zone {{and part of the}} staurolite zone of the enclosing meta-sediments. These amphibolites were studied petrographically and from them thirty-four were used for modal analysis and chemical analyses for total iron (as Fe 2 O 3), CaO, TiO 2, K 2 O, MnO and trace elements. Twelve of the constituent hornblendes were analysed for all major and minor elements and trace elements. The other 22 constituent hornblendes were analysed for total iron (as Fe 2 O 3), CaO, TiO 2, K 2 O, MnO and trace elements. Seven of the constituent horn-blendes and six constituent plagioclases were used for optical determinations and x-ray diffractometric studies. On the basis of relict texture some of the amphibolites are concluded to be definitely ortho-amphibolites. Field relations of a few hornblende-bearing rocks suggest that they have meta-sedimentary origin. The {{origin of the}} remaining majority of the amphibolites is inconclusive. The metamorphism of the amphibolites is essentially iso-chemical throughout the range of conditions represented by the appearance of successively the garnet and the staurolite isophases in the enclosing meta-sediments. What fluctuations in composition are observed appear to be random in character, attributable to minor variations in original composition or to retrograde alteration. The compositions of the constituent hornblendes do not show any significant correlation with intensity of metamorphism and the average composition remains roughly constant throughout the sequence. The concentrations of the various components in the horn-blendes seem to be closely related to the concentrations of the same components in the corresponding amphibolites. The ratios of the concentrations of the various components between horn-blende and amphibolite do not show any significant trend with metamorphic rank and are reasonably constant over the range of metamorphic conditions represented here. The composition of the hornblendes is closely related to specific gravity and broadly related to dimensions of unit cells but there is no close correlation between composition and optics. Size of unit cells in hornblendes appear to be unrelated to metamorphic rank...|$|R
