50|$|The {{expedition}} was {{an idea of}} the Swiss {{doctor and}} photographer Jules Jacot-Guillarmod. In April 1905 he proposed his plans to the British occultist Aleister Crowley, with whom he had participated in Oscar Eckenstein's K2 expedition in 1902. Crowley only agreed to join since he would be the sole climbing leader and he would have the opportunity to break the altitude record. The record at the time was held by either William Woodman Graham, Emil Boss and Ulrich Kauffmann on Kabru (7,315 m), a widely <b>contested</b> <b>claim,</b> or Matthias Zurbriggen on Aconcagua (6,962 m).|$|E
50|$|As {{an outcome}} of the {{controversial}} 1872 election, four US seats from Louisiana were also contested, including Pinchback's seat in the at-large position. He was the first African American elected to Congress from Louisiana. In early 1873, both the Republican William Kellogg-allied state legislators, who had a slight majority, and the Democrat John McEnery-allied legislators elected US Senators. Pinchback was elected by the Republicans and presented the Senate with his credentials. The Democratic candidate also presented credentials. As the 1872 gubernatorial contest had involved the national government, Congress was initially reluctant to assess these issues. The <b>contested</b> <b>claim</b> was not settled for years, when Democrats controlled Congress.|$|E
5000|$|In What Pragmatism Means, James {{writes that}} the central point of his own {{doctrine}} of truth is, in brief, that [...] "Truths emerge from facts, but they dip forward into facts again and add to them; which facts again create or reveal new truth (the word is indifferent) and so on indefinitely. The 'facts' themselves meanwhile are not true. They simply are. Truth is {{the function of the}} beliefs that start and terminate among them." [...] Richard Rorty made the <b>contested</b> <b>claim</b> that James did not mean to give a theory of truth with this statement and that we should not regard it as such. However, other pragmatism scholars such as Susan Haack and Howard Mounce do not share Rorty's instrumentalist interpretation of James.|$|E

50|$|Around 1810 Manuel Gutiérrez, {{executor}} of Juan José Domínguez's {{will and}} de facto owner of his Rancho San Pedro, granted permission to then 17-year-old José Dolores Sepúlveda to herd livestock {{in the southwestern}} reaches of Rancho San Pedro. This eventually {{became the basis for}} the Sepúlveda family's <b>contested</b> <b>claim</b> to the Rancho de los Palos Verdes, carved out of Rancho San Pedro lands. Dolores went to Monterey to settle his land title, but on his return trip, he was killed in the Chumash revolt at Mission La Purísima Concepción in 1824. In 1834, a judicial decree was made by Governor José Figueroa which was intended to settle the dispute between the Domínguez and Sepúlveda families. Juan Capistrano Sepúlveda and José Loreto Sepúlveda were awarded the 31629 acre Rancho de los Palos Verdes.|$|E
50|$|The {{grant was}} {{originally}} {{a part of}} Manuel Dominguez's Rancho San Pedro Spanish land grant. Around 1810 Manuel Guttierez, executor of Dominguez’s will and de facto owner of his rancho, granted permission to then 17-year-old Jose Dolores Sepulveda to herd livestock in the southwestern reaches of the Rancho San Pedro. This eventually {{became the basis for}} the Sepulveda family’s <b>contested</b> <b>claim</b> to the Rancho de los Palos Verdes. Dolores had trouble getting his land title cleared, so he took a trip to Monterey to get the matter definitely settled and, on his return trip, he was killed in the Chumash revolt at Mission La Purísima Concepción in 1824.

50|$|One {{story about}} the {{cancellation}} of CVA-01 states that the RAF moved Australia by 500 miles in its documents to support the air force's preferred strategy of land-based aircraft. Regardless of the story's veracity, the principal reason for the cancellation was that the Defence Review board believed adequate cover could be better provided East of Suez by RAF strike aircraft flying from bases in Australia and uninhabited Islands in the Indian Ocean, rather than by a small carrier fleet in the 1970s which would have still included Hermes. The Review asserted the carrier's only effective use was to project British power east of Suez. The Review again asserted, without evidence, that the RN carriers were too 'vulnerable' for the RN's other major theatre in the North Atlantic. When the British government later decided in 1967 that it would withdraw from east of Suez, the case for carriers weakened further. The 1966 Review stated that the ability of RAF to cover 300 miles offshore was enough for the 1970s, regardless of the RAF'S <b>contested</b> <b>claim</b> {{to be able to}} provide air cover out to 700 miles. The cancellation of 150 TSR2 aircraft by Labour in mid 1965 was the basis of the RAF's argument for the 'island hopping strategy'.|$|E

5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} <b>contested</b> <b>claim</b> by Anderson {{regarding}} her method is her assertion that women shouldn't lift {{more than three}} pounds. This has led to rebuttals from various fitness experts. Shawn Mozen pointed out that weight lifting increases bone density and that many things women lift in their every day life weigh more than that, an argument concurred by personal trainer Kat Whitfield. Tony Gentilcore has stated that for women [...] "lifting heavy WILL NOT make you big and bulky."Fellow trainer Dean Somerset states that, [...] "women are at a disadvantage due to lower circulating levels of testosterone, different muscle architecture than men (think of how men can have a very prominent biceps peak where women typically can’t), and a lower relative release of growth hormone. Aside from that, women typically need much more volume than men to make any kind of substantial gains in muscle size." [...] Alfonso Moretti also takes issue with, [...] "Tracy Anderson's claims that she can take any woman’s body and transform it into a tiny, dancers physique... In my opinion that is completely impossible, unless of course she has devised a time travel technique {{to go back in}} time and change who your parents are." ...|$|E
50|$|The Handelszeitung {{reported}} about {{suspicions that}} high-level Lyoness members were earlier involved in (other) pyramid schemes, like the ‘Spirit of Independence’. It also mentioned a system called ‘GTS’ (Global Trade System), operated by Erin Trade SA, {{as a former}} organisation tied to Hubert Freidl. Like Lyoness, this company {{has been called a}} pyramid scheme in the public debate. The Kleine Zeitung reported that various experts were looking at the investment schemes for advertising campaigns organised by Lyoness, and whether a prospectus was required before attracting capital from investors. Lyoness-hired professor Susanne Kalls concluded that no capital market regulations were violated by not issuing a prospectus; attorney Karl Hengstberger came to the opposite conclusion but agreed with Kalls that the Lyoness business package does not constitute an investment. In the same article, Lyoness spokesman Mathias Vorbach admits that the company may have had some trouble before, but that those days are behind it - Lyoness has learned from its mistakes. He asserts that legal problems have only appeared in Austria (a <b>contested</b> <b>claim)</b> and that 95% of the Lyoness members just shop and do not participate in the earning models offered by Lyoness. However, the Beobachter, after reportedly considering internal Lyoness documents, published an article suggesting that 99.7% of the Lyoness turnover derives from down-payments on future purchases, not from actual shopping or (saved up) discounts.|$|E

In passing, the article also comments {{of the question of}} nationality and eligibility within the context of Northern Irish football. It is agued that whilst debates about the need for a new stadium have tended to focus to date on political and conceptual matters, it is likely that, in the foreseeable future, legal, financial and technical difficulties will predominate...|$|E

40|$|In what follows, I explore why the {{question}} of ‘access for all’ is both important and difficult. Beginning by treating it as a <b>contested</b> <b>claim,</b> I will consider some of its political, institutional and professional implications. What do I mean by saying that access for all is a <b>contested</b> <b>claim?</b> First of all, it is a claim – a demand that access for all needs to be created. It is a claim about change. To demand ‘access for all’ is to speak about, and speak against, social conditions that are unjust, unequal or excluding. At its simplest, then, to claim ‘access for all’ is to address social arrangements in which all {{people do not have}} access. Secondly, it is a claim made by – or on behalf of – specific social groups against their experience of exclusion, marginalization or subordination. I have added these other terms because I think that ‘exclusion’ is too simple, and too problematic, a term to capture all the aspects of unjust social arrangements that produce claims for ‘access’. 1 Access is a demand to be treated equitably in relation to a range of valued social resources, conditions and relationships. It is a claim to be a member: of the society, the polity or the nation. It is a claim to be a citizen: to possess rights and the capacity to make legitimate demands on the state. It is a claim on the apparatuses and agencies that sustain social citizenship: citizenship brings with it access to benefits, services and rights of ‘fair dealing’ or ‘fair treatment’. As this last point suggests, it is a claim about equality: the expectation that all citizens will be dealt with by public agencies in ways that are not discriminatory or oppressive...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{assertion}} of maritime adjudicative jurisdiction by Australian courts over a Japanese whaling company for acts contrary to Australian {{law in the}} Antarctic Southern Ocean is alarming. Private litigation, based on an internationally disputed claim to sovereignty over Antarctic territory and a further <b>contested</b> <b>claim</b> to an EEZ appurtenant to that territory, ought not {{to serve as a}} proxy for cooperative (and hopefully effective) international management of the Antarctic environment. The big danger is that if other states follow Australia 2 ̆ 7 s lead in claiming sovereign rights and exercising attendant jurisdiction the chances of natural resource over-exploitation and environmental harm in the Antarctic is increased. It will, I believe, in the long run exacerbate the likelihood of a scramble for important, scarce and economically viable resources...|$|E

40|$|We {{retrospectively}} {{analyzed the}} importance of factors relating to worker's compensation for 273 wrists in 211 consecutive patients who underwent primary carpal tunnel release. Patients were divided into three groups: non-work related, worker's compensation—uncontested, and worker's compensation—contested. Contested claims were those in which the worker's compensation carrier denied authorization for surgery, and in which such authorization was given following intervention by a plaintiff's attorney. Results: there were {{no statistically significant differences}} in postoperative return of grip strength and in postoperative return to work intervals in comparing groups I and II. However, the contested worker's compensation patients were much less likely (and much slower) to return to light duty and to return to full duty work. Return of grip strength was slower and less complete in this group as well. Within worker's compensation, a <b>contested</b> <b>claim</b> portends a poorer prognosis. Uncontested worker's compensation claimants have nearly as good a prognosis as non-compensation patients...|$|E
40|$|Celebrity studies critiques {{the ways}} in which celebrity culture {{constructs}} discourses of authenticity and disclosure, offering the cultural and economic circulation of the ‘private’ self. Rarely, however, do we turn the spotlight on ourselves as not only scholars of stardom and celebrity, but also part of the audience. Autoethnography has become increasingly important across different disciplines, although its status within media and cultural studies is less visible and secure, not least because the emphasis on personal attachments to media forms may threaten the discipline’s still <b>contested</b> <b>claim</b> to cultural legitimacy. The study of stars and celebrities has often found itself at the ‘lower’ end of this already debased continuum, perhaps making such tensions particularly acute. Based on three personal narratives of engagements with stars and celebrities, this co-authored article explores the potential relationships between autoethnography and celebrity studies, and considers the personal, intellectual, and political implications of bringing the scholar into the celebrity frame...|$|E
40|$|The Hercules and Cacus {{episode in}} Book VIII {{highlights}} the problematic nature of Aeneas’ exploits throughout the Aeneid. Through {{the violence of}} Hercules, Vergil makes the reader question whether a story like the founding of Rome and its eventual imperial expansion can be as cut and dry as {{the story of a}} rugged hero slaughtering someone whose name literally means “evil one” might superficially seem. Calling into question Aeneas’ morality and his justification for settling in Italy in turn casts doubt on Augustus’ own means of attaining power. The Hercules and Cacus episode is fundamental {{to our understanding of the}} Aeneid as a whole inasmuch as it brings up the question of right. The question of the rightful owner of Geryon’s cattle finds its parallel in Aeneas and Turnus’ dispute over betrothal to Lavinia, as well as in Augustus’ <b>contested</b> <b>claim</b> to rule Rome. The Italy of Hercules’ day, in which violence determines right, must be compared with the universal empire Augustus will eventually establish. This paper explores to what extent the Hercules and Cacus episode can influence our understanding of Aeneas and Augustus and how Vergil might be reacting to the political climate of his day through his poetry.
