5|$|The {{coronary}} sinus {{is a large}} vein that drains {{into the}} right atrium, and receives most of the venous drainage of the heart. It receives blood from the great <b>cardiac</b> vein (receiving the left atrium and both ventricles), the posterior <b>cardiac</b> vein (draining {{the back of the}} left ventricle), the middle <b>cardiac</b> vein (draining the bottom of the left and right ventricles), and small <b>cardiac</b> veins. The anterior <b>cardiac</b> veins drain the front of the right ventricle and drain directly into the right atrium.|$|E
5000|$|Hayes had {{previously}} played bass with The Dave Howard Singers and guitar with Panixphere, Ring and <b>Cardiacs.</b> He joined Levitation through knowing Terry Bickers through musical friends in South London, and brought former Ring bandmate Robert White with him. Hayes left <b>Cardiacs</b> {{to commit to}} Levitation full-time, with Hayes admitting [...] "I was playing guitar in <b>Cardiacs.</b> They were the band I left for Levitation. I loved <b>Cardiacs</b> and thought they were the best band in Britain at the time. That's how much I believed in Levitation. The chemistry was explosive". Whilst still in Levitation, he reformed Ring with Levitation drummer David Francolini and <b>Cardiacs</b> frontman Tim Smith.|$|R

50|$|On {{returning}} to London, He {{worked for the}} remainder of the 1980s as crew member or live sound engineer, touring with several acts including Immaculate Fools, It's Immaterial, and Then Jerico. He was also <b>Cardiacs</b> front-of-house engineer at this time, and a member of the band Grown Ups with William D. Drake (<b>Cardiacs),</b> Elaine Herman, Jon Bastable (The Trudy), Dominic Luckman (<b>Cardiacs)</b> and Craig Fortnam. Five tracks were recorded by this line-up but never released.|$|R
5|$|<b>Cardiac</b> {{surgery was}} {{developed}} at the university's Variety Club Hospital, where by 1957, more than 200 patients had survived open-heart operations, many of them children.

5|$|Heart {{disease is}} {{diagnosed}} by {{the taking of}} a medical history, a <b>cardiac</b> examination, and further investigations, including blood tests, echocardiograms, ECGs and imaging. Other invasive procedures such as <b>cardiac</b> catheterisation can also play a role.|$|E
50|$|Of interest, <b>Cardiacs</b> {{shared the}} same {{management}} as Napalm Death at the time, and both bands recorded live videos in the same venue that day (Napalm Death recorded Live Corruption). Some members of Napalm Death are huge fans of <b>Cardiacs.</b> Contrary to some reports, however, they {{were not on the}} same bill. The two video recordings were entirely separate events with <b>Cardiacs</b> recording in the afternoon and Napalm Death in the evening.|$|R

5|$|Myosin {{regulatory}} {{light chain}} 2, ventricular/cardiac muscle isoform (MLC-2) {{also known as}} the regulatory light chain of myosin (RLC) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MYL2 gene. This <b>cardiac</b> ventricular RLC isoform is distinct from that expressed in skeletal muscle (MYLPF), smooth muscle (MYL12B) and <b>cardiac</b> atrial muscle (MYL7).|$|E
5|$|Phosphorylation: cTnI was {{the first}} sarcomeric protein {{identified}} to be a substrate of PKA. Phosphorylation of cTnI at Ser23/Ser24 under adrenergic stimulation enhances relaxation of <b>cardiac</b> muscle, which is critical to <b>cardiac</b> function especially at fast heart rate. Whereas PKA phosphorylation of Ser23/Ser24 decreases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and increases relaxation, phosphorylation of Ser42/Ser44 by PKC increases Ca2+ sensitivity and decreases <b>cardiac</b> muscle relaxation. Ser5/Ser6, Tyr26, Thr31, Ser39, Thr51, Ser77, Thr78, Thr129, Thr143 and Ser150 are also phosphorylation sites in human cTnI.|$|E
50|$|Toy World {{has never}} been reissued, and is {{consequently}} one of the rarest <b>Cardiacs</b> releases. However, many of the pieces from it have either been reissued on other <b>Cardiacs</b> releases or have had live versions appearing on other albums.|$|R

5|$|The TNNI3 gene {{encoding}} <b>cardiac</b> troponin I (cTnI) {{is located}} at 19q13.4 in the human chromosomal genome. Human cTnI is a 24 kDa protein consisting of 210 amino acids with isoelectric point (pI) of 9.87. cTnI is exclusively expressed in adult <b>cardiac</b> muscle.|$|E
5|$|The {{half-life}} of cTnI {{in adult}} cardiomyocytes {{is estimated to}} be ~3.2 days and there is a pool of unassembled <b>cardiac</b> TnI in the cytoplasm. <b>Cardiac</b> TnI is exclusively expressed in the myocardium and is thus a highly specific diagnostic marker for <b>cardiac</b> muscle injuries, and cTnI has been universally used as indicator for myocardial infarction. An increased level of serum cTnI also independently predicts poor prognosis of critically ill patients in the absence of acute coronary syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves supply sensation to {{the larynx}} below the vocal cords, gives <b>cardiac</b> branches {{to the deep}} <b>cardiac</b> plexus, and branches to the trachea, esophagus and the inferior constrictor muscles.

50|$|On Land {{and in the}} Sea is {{the fifth}} studio album by the English rock band <b>Cardiacs.</b> It was {{recorded}} and mixed in 1988 at The Slaughterhouse studios in Yorkshire, produced by <b>Cardiacs</b> band leader Tim Smith and engineered by Roger Tebbutt.|$|R
50|$|Heaven Born and Ever Bright was {{the first}} <b>Cardiacs</b> album since the {{departure}} of almost half the group. Percussionist Tim Quy left <b>Cardiacs</b> in 1990, and has not worked with them since. Saxophonist Sarah Smith and keyboardist William D. Drake also stopped touring with the band, although they have contributed to later recordings and made occasional guest appearances at concerts. Christian Hayes left <b>Cardiacs</b> during {{the making of the}} album, although it still features many of his guitar and vocal performances as well as a song he co-wrote. Heaven Born and Ever Bright is the first <b>Cardiacs</b> album featuring Jon Poole, but their last with Dominic Luckman. It is unclear how much Jon Poole is actually featured on the record.|$|R
50|$|Black Leather Mojo is {{the debut}} album {{released}} in 2000 by British Rock band Silver Ginger 5. Notably, {{the album was}} produced by Tim Smith of the <b>Cardiacs,</b> whom group frontman Ginger counted {{as one of his}} biggest influences. It was claimed by Ginger himself in an interview with Kerrang! magazine, that the audition for Wildhearts bassist Danny McCormack consisted of taking LSD and attending a <b>Cardiacs</b> concert. The link with the <b>Cardiacs</b> continued with the group's guitarist Jon Poole playing bass on Black Leather Mojo.|$|R
5|$|Theoretically, a <b>cardiac</b> {{troponin}} activator {{could be}} useful for increasing <b>cardiac</b> contractility {{in the treatment of}} systolic heart failure, whereas a troponin inhibitor could be used to favor relaxation in the treatment of diastolic heart failure. Troponin modulators could also be used to reverse the impact of cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in the thin filament.|$|E
5|$|To date, no high {{resolution}} structure of ssTnI has been solved. As homologous proteins, ssTnI, fast skeletal muscle TnI and <b>cardiac</b> TnI have highly conserved structures and crystallographic {{high resolution}} structure of partial <b>cardiac</b> and fast skeletal troponin complex are both available. Therefore, the structure-function relationship of ssTnI would {{rely on the}} information from studies performed on fast skeletal muscle and <b>cardiac</b> TnI.|$|E
25|$|Ventricular {{fibrillation}} {{produces an}} ECG but is too dysfunctional {{to produce a}} life-sustaining <b>cardiac</b> output. Certain rhythms {{are known to have}} good <b>cardiac</b> output and some are known to have bad <b>cardiac</b> output.|$|E
50|$|All That Glitters Is a Mares Nest is a live album by the English {{rock band}} <b>Cardiacs.</b> It is their third live album, and was {{originally}} {{recorded in the}} afternoon in the Salisbury Arts Centre on 30 June 1990. In effect, it is the soundtrack album to the live concert film Maresnest. All That Glitters Is a Mares Nest is, technically, the last <b>Cardiacs</b> recording to feature saxophonist Sarah Smith, percussionist Tim Quy and keyboard player William D. Drake as band members. It is the only <b>Cardiacs</b> album to feature guitarist Christian Hayes throughout.|$|R
