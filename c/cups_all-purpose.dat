50|$|Special cake flour {{with a high}} starch-to-gluten {{ratio is}} made from fine-textured, soft, low-protein wheat. It is {{strongly}} bleached, and compared to all-purpose flour, cake flour tends to result in cakes with a lighter, less dense texture. Therefore, it is frequently specified or preferred in cakes meant to be soft, light, and/or bright white, such as angel food cake. However, if cake flour is called for, a substitute {{can be made by}} replacing a small percentage of all-purpose flour with cornstarch or removing two tablespoons from each <b>cup</b> of <b>all-purpose</b> flour. Some recipes explicitly specify or permit all-purpose flour, notably where a firmer or denser cake texture is desired.|$|R
