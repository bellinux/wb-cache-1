40|$|International audienceHypothesis: Alginate {{capsules}} {{have several}} applications. Their functionality depends considerably on their permeability, chemical and mechanical stability. Consequently, {{the creation of}} composite system by addition of further components is expected to control mechanical and release properties of alginate capsules. Experiments: Alginate and alginate-sodium caseinate composite liquid-core capsules were prepared by a simple extrusion. The influence of the preparation pH and sodium caseinate concentration on capsules physico-chemical properties was investigated. Findings: Results showed that sodium caseinate influenced significantly capsules properties. As regards to the membrane mechanical stability, composite capsules prepared at pH below the isoelectric point of sodium caseinate exhibited the highest surface Young's modulus, increasing with protein content, explained by potential electrostatic interactions between sodium caseinate amino-groups and alginate carboxylic group. The kinetic of <b>cochineal</b> <b>red</b> <b>A</b> release changed significantly for composite capsules and showed a pH-responsive release. Findings: Sodium caseinate-dye mixture studied by absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed complex formation at pH 2 by electrostatic interactions between sodium caseinate tryptophan residues and cochineal red sulfonate-groups. Consequently, the release mechanism was explained by membrane adsorption process. Findings: This global approach is useful to control release mechanism from macro and micro-capsules by incorporating guest molecules which can interact with the entrapped molecule under specific conditions...|$|E

This was true above all of the advantage that carmine had over safflower, resulting in an immediate and sharp increase in the sheer area over which <b>cochineal</b> <b>red</b> was applied from 1869 on, most conspicuously in solid red backgrounds (cf. Figs.  1 and 7), or in wide bands of red gradation down from the upper edge or up from the horizon.

50|$|The Salor {{confederation}} (consisting {{mainly of}} the Salor proper and Saryk) {{is believed to}} have lived originally in the Amu Darya valley, and the oases of southern Turkmenistan, including Merv. They used bright shades of madder red. The typical Salor göl has a lobed rosette shade, upright-cross division and motif-filling. Its four central quarters are dyed in diagonally opposed colours. The style of colouring is labelled “Central Asian”. The göl are arranged on the main field of a carpet {{in a way that makes}} them appear to “float” on the field, creating the impression of a diagonal movement. A group of Turkmen carpets with common structural features were termed “S-group” and identified as Salor rugs by Mackie and Thompson. The carpets of the “S-group” are asymmetrically knotted, open to the left. Warps are ivory, with alternate warps deeply depressed, wefts of two-ply brown wool, occasionally dyed red. Their pile is less supple than other Turkmen rugs, fairly long. Sometimes silk is used, but rarely cotton. Red colour is mostly from madder, but lac and <b>cochineal</b> <b>reds</b> have been found. Older Saryk weavings often have symmetric knots.|$|R

25|$|During {{the colonial}} era, Veracruz {{was the main}} port of entry for {{immigrants}} from Spain, African slaves, and all types of luxury goods for import and export. The first group of Franciscans arrived in Veracruz in 1524, walking barefoot to {{the capital of the}} Spanish colony of New Spain. The route between Veracruz and the Spanish capital of Mexico City, built {{on the site of the}} Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, was the key trade route during the colonial era. Much of the history of the state is involved with the port city that Cortés founded in 1519. Veracruz became the principal and often only port to export and import goods between the colony of New Spain and Spain itself. To ensure the port’s monopoly, it came to have control over almost all of New Spain's Gulf coastline. New Spain's silver and <b>cochineal</b> <b>red</b> dye, were the two most important exports from the port, along with chocolate, vanilla, chili peppers, and much more were exported. Imported were livestock (sheep, cows, goats, horses), wheat and other cultivars. From the Caribbean, slaves, pineapple, and sugar cane were introduced. This made the port a highly prized target for pirates during the colonial period, with attacks and sackings frequent. This led to the building of the fort of San Juan de Ulúa and the fortification of the city overall.|$|R

It was shipped by the Spanish from Acapulco to Manila, and on to China by early seventeenth century, and could have easily found its way to Japan [22]. The best-documented use of cochineal in Japan, however, was not as a dye but in the form of cochineal-dyed woolen cloth, which was much prized by samurai for making into garments [23, 24]. The rarity of the use of cochineal was probably due to its higher cost than the more easily available lac.|$|R

Santa María Atzompa produces glazed, glass-inlaid pottery of green, while San Antonio Arrazola and San Martín Tilcajete make alebrijes, small painted wooden figures. San Bartolo Coyotepec is known for its barro negro pottery, and Teotitlán del Valle works with wool and llama to make tapetes, or more commonly, throw rugs. These rugs are known for their intense colors, made traditionally with natural dyes, made from cempasúchil (yellow), <b>cochineal</b> (<b>red)</b> and indigo (blue). In addition, Oaxaca city and surrounding towns have market days, where one can visit the tianguis (open-air markets) set up for that day. There are markets on each day of the week. Monday in Miahuatlan is for buying daily staples, and Tuesday, in Ayoquezco is noted for wood furniture. On Wednesday, people head to Etla and Zimatlán for dairy products, especially cheese. Thursday is reserved for the two largest tianguis in Ejutla and Villa de Zaachila. On Friday, in Coyotepec, Jalietza and Ocotlán cotton textiles, embroidered blouses, corn-husk flowers and glazed pottery from Atzompa are sold. Also Llano park in Oaxaca has a small market.

5000|$|The {{system of}} land tenure {{has been cited}} {{as one of the}} reasons that Mexico failed to develop {{economically}} during the colonial period, with large estates inefficiently organized and run and the [...] "concentration of land ownership per se caused waste and misallocation of resources." [...] These causes were posited before a plethora of studies of the hacienda and smaller agrarian enterprises as well as broader regional studies were done in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. These meticulous studies of individual haciendas and regions over time demonstrates that hacienda owners were profit-seeking entrepreneurs. They had the advantage of economies of scale that smaller holders and Indian villages did not in cultivation of grains, pulque, sugar, and sisal and in ranching, with cattle and sheep. Great haciendas did not completely dominate the agrarian sector, since there were products that could be efficiently produced by smaller holders and Indian villages, such as fruits and vegetables, <b>cochineal</b> <b>red</b> dye, and animals that could be raised in confined spaces, such as pigs and chickens. Small holders also produced wine, cotton and tobacco. In the eighteenth century, the crown created a tobacco monopoly on both cultivation and manufacturing of tobacco products.As Spanish agrarian enterprises developed, acquiring title to land became important. As the size of the indigenous labor force dropped and as the number of Spaniards seeking land and access to labor increased, a transitional labor institution called repartimiento ("allotment") developed, in which the crown allotted indigenous labor to Spaniards on a temporary basis. Many Spanish landowners found the system unsatisfactory since they could not count on receiving an allocation that suited their needs. The repartimiento for agriculture was abolished in 1632. Large-scale landed estates or haciendas developed, and most needed both a small permanent labor force supplemented by temporary labor at peak times, such as planting and harvesting.|$|R
