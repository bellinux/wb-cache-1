5|$|Initially unplanned, The Missing Link was {{developed}} by Human Revolutions <b>core</b> <b>staff,</b> including producer David Anfossi, director Jean-François Dugas, writer Mary DeMarle, and composer Michael McCann. The story {{was designed as a}} standalone experience, partially due to the technical and aesthetic improvements the team had made. A boss battle was designed to allow for multiple solutions, in contrast to the limited action-based approaches of the main game's boss fights. Reception was generally positive: despite some mixed opinions on the story, praise was given to the improved visuals and gameplay.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Takahashi {{talked with}} Hirohide Sugiura, who had {{likewise}} worked at Square and {{was beginning to}} feel frustrated {{due to a lack of}} creative freedom. After discussing the matter, the two decided to create their own company and pursue projects they wanted to create. When planning their new company, Takahashi and Sugiura decided that they needed a publisher with substantial market presence to help them rather than being an independent studio. Takahashi and Sugiura approached multiple companies for support, but most of the companies they contacted outright rejected their offer as they believed that Monolith Soft should be an independent company. However, Namco were interested in investing into Monolith Soft as a dedicated subsidiary, whilst handling logistics and marketing so that the <b>core</b> <b>staff</b> could focus on game development. An important supporter of Monolith Soft was Namco's founder Masaya Nakamura, who shared many of Takahashi and Sugiura's goals and ideals. Monolith Soft is noted as being one of a group of video game companies—alongside Sacnoth, Love-de-Lic and Mistwalker—founded by Square staff who had worked on notable titles produced during the 1990s. The company was officially founded on 1 October 1999 by Takahashi, Sugiura, and Yasuyuki Honne, who had worked at Square on both the Chrono series and with Takahashi on Xenogears. The company's offices were originally based in Yokohama.|$|E

As an in-house development studio of the 3DO Company, New World Computing ceased to exist with the dissolution of its parent organization.|$|E

The game was co-developed by Red Company and Sega CS2 R, who had produced the original game. Oji Hiroi returned as producer, Shinichi Ito as director, Satoru Akahori as writer, Hidenori Matsubara and Kōsuke Fujishima as the character designers, and Kohei Tanaka as composer.

500|$|The {{original}} version of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light {{was released in}} 1990 for the Famicom by Intelligent Systems, who had previously created the strategy title Famicom Wars: it was designed and written for by series creator Shouzou Kaga, who envisioned {{a new type of}} role-playing experience unknown at the time. The success of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light began the Fire Emblem series. According to co-director Masayuki Horikawa, development started on Shadow Dragon during the development of , which released in 2007. The development period was estimated at [...] "one and a bit years", although full development lasted ten months as the first part of development overlapped with Radiant Dawn. It was decided by Intelligent Systems to remake Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light so more players could experience software from their early days. They also wanted players outside Japan to experience the game for the first time. The <b>core</b> <b>staff</b> included producer Tohru Narihiro and director Masayuki Horikawa from Intelligent Systems, and producer Hitoshi Yamagami and director Masaki Tawara from Nintendo.|$|E

A special web radio series featuring actors from the show also began broadcast in July alongside the series. Dubbed [...] "Blood-R", it ran for eleven episodes. It first began broadcasting on Mainichi Broadcasting System (MBS) on July 7 and Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) on July 8. Several episodes were repeated during the original broadcast in a three-day successive broadcast in August. Its twelve-episode run ended on September 30, 2011.

500|$|The engines for {{the games}} are {{generally}} developed in-house: the cited reasons for this included problems with outsourced development. Until Vesperia, the team worked on a by-project basis, creating new development tools and engines for each installment. Due to cost increases, the development process was altered and streamlined as more user-friendly software engines became available. The studio was divided into two teams: Team Destiny worked on 2D Tales titles such as Tales of Destiny, while Team Symphonia developed 3D titles. In-house, major distinctions were made between the two studios except for some <b>core</b> <b>staff</b> [...] Namco Tales produced {{the majority of the}} mainline Tales games until its absorption in 2011. The notable exceptions are Legendia, which was developed by an internal staff group at Bandai Namco, and Innocence, which was developed by Alfa System. Alfa System also developed many of the portable spin-off titles. After the absorption of Namco Tales by Bandai Namco, the teams and staff transferred to the new in-house development studio called Bandai Namco Studios. The size of the teams was reduced and the previous studio's main divisions were merged. This allowed production to be streamlined, but also meant that the team could only focus on one game at a time, rather than working on two games simultaneously as they had done before.|$|E
500|$|Hironobu Sakaguchi had {{intended}} to make a role-playing game (RPG) for a long time, but his employer Square refused to give him permission as it expected low sales of such a product. However, when the RPG Dragon Quest was released and {{proved to be a}} hit in Japan, the company reconsidered its stance on the genre and approved Sakaguchi's vision of an RPG inspired by [...] and [...] Only three of his colleagues volunteered to join this project headed by him because he was thought of as a [...] "rough boss" [...] in spite of his unsuccessful creations. Eventually, Final Fantasy was developed by a team of seven <b>core</b> <b>staff</b> members within Square referred to as the [...] "A-Team". Sakaguchi convinced fellow game designers Koichi Ishii and Akitoshi Kawazu to join the project. Kawazu was mainly responsible for the battle system and sequences, which he based heavily on the tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons and the RPG Wizardry. For example, enemies' weaknesses to elements such as fire and ice had not been included in Japanese RPGs up until that point. Kawazu had grown fond of such aspects of Western RPGs and decided to incorporate them into Final Fantasy. He also advocated the player's option to freely choose their own party member classes {{at the beginning of the}} game as he feels [...] "the fun in an RPG begins when you create a character".|$|E

500|$|When {{development}} {{began in}} 2011, {{only a few}} <b>core</b> <b>staff</b> members {{were working on the}} game, forming a skeleton team. At this time, Yamazaki said that the player should be able to use emotions and analytical psychology to reach the truth, in addition to using evidence: he thought that previous Ace Attorney games had only focused on evidence versus statements, and wanted to introduce a third element. Natsuki Ikawa, one of the game designers, read books on psychology and talked to the other staff members about what to do. She wrote down several ideas for how to handle it, including goggles that show the witness's personality as a specter, or a large computer that analyzes brain waves and heart rates, and showed them to Yamazaki, who would say [...] "that's a pretty nifty idea" [...] but still reject them; this contradiction between what he said and what he felt made Ikawa realize the basic concept for the mood matrix system, which was revised through feedback from everyone on the team and was implemented in the game. Another game designer, Yoriki Daigo, worked on several new features, including making the player able to move between locations freely and designing the revisualization system. Because the game was built from the ground up, the user interface for investigation sections was overhauled completely to be more visually appealing. The developers tried to keep the game simple, keeping it in line with Takumi's original vision of a game simple enough for his mother to play.|$|E

The Pander D had the much more streamlined, rounded fuselage, quadrant shaped fin and faired headrest that VIH had used with the H.2; compared with the C.12, the Pander's wings were more tapered, had rounded tips and lacked the large cutouts in the trailing edge roots. [...] The trailing edges of the elevators were unswept, not forward swept as on the C.12.|$|E
