5|$|There {{are many}} binary {{operations}} that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> generalizations of the addition operation {{on the real}} numbers. The field of abstract algebra is centrally concerned with such generalized operations, and they also appear in set theory and category theory.|$|E
5|$|Book {{embedding}} {{has also}} been frequently applied in the visualization of network data. Two of the standard layouts in graph drawing, arc diagrams and circular layouts, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> book embeddings, and book embedding {{has also been}} applied {{in the construction of}} clustered layouts, simultaneous embeddings, and three-dimensional graph drawings.|$|E

5|$|Graphs and {{directed}} graphs <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{a special case}} of the far more general notion called relational structures (defined as a set with a tuple of relations on it). Directed graphs are structures with a single binary relation (adjacency) on the domain (the vertex set). Under this view, homomorphisms of such structures are exactly graph homomorphisms.|$|E
5|$|Incidentally, the {{harmonic}} telegraph directly suggested to Bell {{the idea of}} the telephone.

It is no great leap from this view of {{the harmonic}} telegraph to the idea that speech can be converted to and from an electrical signal.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to interpret the Sylvester sequence {{as the result of}} a greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions, that at each step chooses the smallest possible denominator that makes the partial sum of the series be less than one. Alternatively, the terms of the sequence after the first <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the denominators of the odd greedy expansion of 1/2.|$|E

5|$|Silicon carbide {{exists in}} about 250 {{crystalline}} forms. The polymorphism of SiC {{is characterized by}} a large family of similar crystalline structures called polytypes. They are variations of the same chemical compound that are identical in two dimensions and differ in the third. Thus, they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> layers stacked in a certain sequence.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of This World {{has a deep}} {{focus on}} the nature of revolution, and the novel itself <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a {{reflection}} of Carpentier's ideological perspective towards revolutions. Carpentier tries to establish the idea that a distinction must be made between revolutions and reactions. While a revolution produces progress, a reaction does not.|$|E
5|$|The {{same idea}} of using a DAG to {{represent}} a family of paths occurs in the binary decision diagram, a DAG-based data structure for representing binary functions. In a binary decision diagram, each non-sink vertex is labeled {{by the name of}} a binary variable, and each sink and each edge is labeled by a 0 or 1. The function value for any truth assignment to the variables is the value at the sink found by following a path, starting from the single source vertex, that at each non-sink vertex follows the outgoing edge labeled with the value of that vertex's variable. Just as directed acyclic word graphs <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a compressed form of tries, binary decision diagrams <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> compressed forms of decision trees that save space by allowing paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions.|$|E

Even many natural compounds present in vegetables cause some activation of the AH receptor. This phenomenon <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> adaptive and beneficial, because it protects the organism from toxic and carcinogenic substances. Excessive and persistent stimulation of AH receptor, however, leads to a multitude of adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|A {{configuration}} in Rule 90 can be partitioned {{into two}} subsets of cells {{that do not}} interact with each other. One of these two subsets consists of the cells in even positions at even time steps and the cells in odd positions in odd time steps. The other subset consists of the cells in even positions at odd time steps and the cells in odd positions at even time steps. Each of these two subsets <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a cellular automaton with only its half of the cells.|$|E
5|$|Teilhard de Chardin's {{ideas have}} been seen by advocates of the Gaia {{hypothesis}} proposed by James Lovelock, which holds that the living and nonliving parts of Earth <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a complex interacting system with similarities to a single organism, as being connected to Lovelock's ideas. The Gaia hypothesis has also been viewed by Lynn Margulis and others {{as an extension of}} endosymbiosis and exosymbiosis. This modified hypothesis postulates that all living things have a regulatory effect on the Earth's environment that promotes life overall.|$|E

50|$|Eigenvector {{centrality}} is {{an extension}} of the concept of degree centrality, {{based on the fact that}} in many networks not all vertices have the same weight or importance. A vertex's importance in its network increases if it has more connections to important vertices. Eigenvector centrality, therefore, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> a centrality scoring system for not just one but its neighboring vertices as well.|$|R
5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the {{geometry}} of spacetime is {{described in terms of}} a certain vacuum solution of Einstein's equation called anti-de Sitter space. In very elementary terms, anti-de Sitter space is a mathematical model of spacetime in which the notion of distance between points (the metric) is different from the notion of distance in ordinary Euclidean geometry. It is closely related to hyperbolic space, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a disk as illustrated on the left. This image shows a tessellation of a disk by triangles and squares. One can define the distance between points of this disk {{in such a way that}} all the triangles and squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in the interior.|$|E

5|$|The first Penrose tiling (tiling P1 below) is an {{aperiodic}} set of six prototiles, {{introduced by}} Roger Penrose in a 1974 paper, {{but it is}} based on pentagons rather than squares. Any attempt to tile the plane with regular pentagons necessarily leaves gaps, but Johannes Kepler showed, in his 1619 work Harmonices Mundi, that these gaps can be filled using pentagrams (star polygons), decagons and related shapes. Traces of these ideas can also be found in the work of Albrecht Dürer. Acknowledging inspiration from Kepler, Penrose found matching rules (which can be imposed by decorations of the edges) for these shapes, obtaining an aperiodic set. His tiling <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a completion of Kepler's finite Aa pattern.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with showing Madonna, the torero (Muñoz), and the townspeople {{preparing}} for, then attending, a bullfight. A secondary staging {{in the video}} presents Madonna standing or sitting near a television set in a room (lit by a single light source from above), while a third staging depicts Madonna writhing around on a bed in her underwear as she watches Muñoz on the television. In the bullring, the torero kills the bull and then comes home and physically and emotionally abuses Madonna. The video <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a statement on classicism, supposing the bullfighter feels threatened and angered by the aristocrat's station, resulting in his physically abusing and then coldly abandoning her.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{resonators}} in the expression {{corresponds to the}} number of passbands required. Lowpass and highpass filters <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> special cases of the resonator expression with {{one or the other of}} the terms becoming zero as appropriate. Bandstop filters can be regarded as a combination of a lowpass and a highpass filter. Multiple bandstop filters can always be expressed in terms of a multiple bandpass filter. In this way it, can be seen that this transformation represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are to be viewed as special cases of it.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze walls and the space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E
