50|$|Introduced in 1984, the Professional Graphics Controller {{offered a}} maximum {{resolution}} of 640×480 with 256 colors at a refresh rate of 60 Hertz—a higher resolution and color depth than EGA and VGA supported. This mode is not BIOS-supported. It {{was intended for}} the computer-aided design market and included 320 kB of display RAM and an on-board Intel 8088 microprocessor. The 8088 was placed directly on the card to permit rapid updates of video memory. Other cards forced the PC's CPU to write to video memory through a slower ISA bus. While never widespread in consumer-class personal computers, its US $4,290 list price compared favorably to US$50,000 dedicated <b>CAD</b> <b>workstations</b> of the time. It was discontinued in 1987 {{with the arrival of}} VGA and 8514.|$|R
5000|$|The Sun Microsystems {{company was}} founded in 1982 by Andy Bechtolsheim with other fellow {{graduate}} students at Stanford University. Bechtolsheim originally designed the SUN computer as a personal <b>CAD</b> <b>workstation</b> for the Stanford University Network (hence the acronym [...] "SUN"). It was designed around the Motorola 68000 processor with the Unix operating system and virtual memory, and, like SGI, had an embedded frame buffer. Later developments included computer servers and workstations built on its own RISC-based processor architecture and a suite of software products such as the Solaris operating system, and the Java platform. By the '90s, Sun workstations were popular for rendering in 3D CGI filmmaking—for example, Disney-Pixar's 1995 movie Toy Story used a render farm of 117 Sun workstations. Sun was a proponent of open systems in general and Unix in particular, and {{a major contributor to}} open source software.|$|E
50|$|From the AX model onwards RM {{computers}} were PC compatible. The 'X Series' was supplemented by the VX, using the new, 32-bit 80386 processor, marketed as a standalone <b>CAD</b> <b>workstation</b> or network fileserver. RM released M Series computers, primarily used as diskless network clients, using the 80286 and later 80386 processors. These used the Micro Channel architecture that {{featured in the}} IBM PS/2, which was faster than the standard ISA architecture, but failed to gain widespread acceptance. RM's fileserver platform became its 'E Series' computers, using the similarly short-lived EISA architecture and using a tower case to allow space for multiple hard disks. These fileservers ran Microsoft LAN Manager (on Microsoft OS/2) preconfigured with client Operating System files (Windows 3.0 and later 3.1) for remote booting and bundled with RM-developed tools for managing network users, client PCs and applications. This was sold as RM Net LM.|$|E
50|$|Opportunity {{to apply}} Lean IT exists in {{multiple}} {{other areas of}} IT besides ADM. For example, service catalog management is a Lean IT approach to provisioning IT services. When, say, a new employee joins a company, the employee’s manager can log into a web-based catalog and select the services needed. This particular employee may need a <b>CAD</b> <b>workstation</b> as well as standard office productivity software and limited access to the company’s extranet. On submitting this request, provisioning of all hardware and software requirements would then be automatic through a lean value stream. In another example, a Lean IT approach to application performance monitoring would automatically detect performance issues at the customer experience level as well as triage, notify support personnel, and collect data to assist in root-cause analysis. Research suggests that IT departments may achieve sizable returns from investing in these and {{other areas of the}} IT function.|$|E

5000|$|As with CNC {{subtractive}} methods, the computer-aided-design - {{computer-aided manufacturing}} CAD-CAM workflow {{in the traditional}} Rapid Prototyping process starts {{with the creation of}} geometric data, either as a 3D solid using a <b>CAD</b> <b>workstation,</b> or 2D slices using a scanning device. For RP this data must represent a valid geometric model; namely, one whose boundary surfaces enclose a finite volume, contain no holes exposing the interior,and do not fold back on themselves. In other words, the object must have an [...] "inside". The model is valid if for each point in 3D space the computer can determine uniquely whether that point lies inside, on, or outside the boundary surface of the model. CAD post-processors will approximate the application vendors' internal CAD geometric forms (e.g., B-splines) with a simplified mathematical form, which in turn is expressed in a specified data format which is a common feature in additive manufacturing: STL (stereolithography) a de facto standard for transferring solid geometric models to SFF machines. To obtain the necessary motion control trajectories to drive the actual SFF, rapid prototyping, 3D printing or additive manufacturing mechanism, the prepared geometric model is typically sliced into layers, and the slices are scanned into lines a [...] "2D drawing" [...] used to generate trajectory as in CNC's, mimicking in reverse the layer-to-layer physical building process.|$|E

The invention is characterized by the fact that model data and relations are structured in a specific manner and substructures restricted by a start and end address are formed, and the start address together with the end address and the associated substructures are stored and called up separately. The process is implemented to great advantage on a <b>CAD</b> <b>workstation</b> computer which is fitted additionally with a functional storage system consisting of a functional access control, a structure processor, a table store, a word-organized model data store and a bus interface to couple the functional storage system to the <b>CAD</b> <b>workstation</b> computer...|$|E

40|$|Computer-aided design {{methods are}} {{extensively}} {{applied in the}} design of aircraft, automobiles, buildings, computer and many other products. In the next future, CAD methods will be employed in conjunction with 3 D immersive displays, which may dramatically improve the possibilities of visualization and interaction offered by common 2 D display <b>CAD</b> <b>workstations.</b> Thus, careful evaluation needs to be made as to how the computer-generated object is represented on 3 D display. It is commonly recognized that a computer-generated 3 D object should be a) an accurate description of the model being designed b) presented in a realistic and integrated format, {{so that it can be}} visualized and interpreted without introducting uncertainty regarding to the represented proprieties (Brown, 1995). To ensure that the displayed 3 D image will satisfy these requirements, it is important focusing on which perceptual/cognitive operation is performed by the user during the design process. We performed one experiment to examine the effects of different visualization techniques of 3 D computer-generated free-form surfaces on depth perception, using Steven's stimulus magnitude estimation paradigm. The factors we investigated were presence versus absence of binocular disparity, four different monocular coding techniques (wireframe, flat shading, Gouraud shading, Gouraud shading and normals) and two levels of shape complexity. We found that a stereoscopic image provides subjects with a visual cue that not only enhances perceived relief of 3 D forms but also improves accuracy of activities necessary for 3 D design, such as depth estimation of free-form surfaces. Furthermore, the nature of the experimental task implies that stereoscopic displays can be most useful when information is presented from a vertical viewpoint...|$|R
40|$|The optics {{manufacturing}} industry is undertaking a significant modernization, as computer-numeric-controlled (CNC) equipment is joining or replacing open-loop equipment and hand lapping/polishing on the shop floor. Several prototype CNC lens grinding platforms employing ring tools are undergoing development and demonstration at the Center for Optics Manufacturing in Rochester, NY, and several machine tool companies have CNC product lines {{aimed at the}} optics industry. Benefits to using CNC ring tool grinding equipment include: essentially unlimited flexibility in selecting radii of curvature without special radiused tooling, the potential for CIM linkages to <b>CAD</b> <b>workstations,</b> and the cultural shift from craftsmen with undocumented procedures to CNC machine operators employing computerized routines for process control. In recent years, these developments, have inspired a number of US optics companies to invest in CNC equipment and participate in process development activities involving bound diamond tooling.

This paper addresses our efforts to optimize fine grinding wheels to support {{the new generation of}} CNC equipment. We begin with a discussion of how fine grinding fits into the optical production process, and then describe an initiative for improving the linkage between optics industry and the grinding wheel industry. For the purposes of this paper, we define fine wheels to have diamond sizes below 20 micrometers, which includes wheels used for what is sometimes called medium grinding (e. g. 10 - 20 micrometers diamond) and for fine grinding (e. g. 2 - 4 micrometers diamond) ...|$|R

The first of these is the characteristic of distance, both physical and conceptual, which separates, on the one hand, the traditional designer from the CAD document and, on the other, the participants of a distributed workshop from each other and each others'thinking. The second, is the typically hybrid nature of such situations where computer technology interacts with more traditional techniques and alternative media are combined both at the level of production and in channels and modes of communication. And finally, the third and most significant for the methodology of the research program, is the fact that both the design triangle and the virtual workshop make explicit aspects of design activity, interaction and intentions which remain hidden or are only implicit in traditional designing. ...|$|E

Robotic melon harvesting has been undertaken as a case study. ^ An intelligent control structure for a robot performing in the uncertain, unknown and ill-structured agricultural domain was modeled as distributed, autonomous computing modules which communicated through a global accessible blackboard structure. The proposed control architecture was tested and verified by simulating all stages of the data flow for the robotic melon harvester: from sensory input, through transformation to information, planning of tasks, and execution of tasks and modification for dynamic conditions. A <b>CAD</b> <b>workstation</b> was used to plan, model, simulate and evaluate the robot 2 ̆ 7 s motions based on simulated real-time sensory input. ^ Performance of the robotic system (i. e., cycle time and percentage of successful cycles) was evaluated by developing simulation models that determined {{the effect of the}} many closely related robot design parameters (e. g., number of arms; operational mode; i. e. serial, parallel; actuator speeds and accelerations) and horticultural practices (fruit distribution). Initially design alternatives were evaluated using animated, visual simulation which provided insight into the complex interaction between the different system components. Dynamic, numerical simulation tools were then developed to quantify the many closely related design parameters for varying cultural practices. An algorithm, based on the traveling salesman problem, was developed to determine the most time efficient robot for a two dimensional task.
