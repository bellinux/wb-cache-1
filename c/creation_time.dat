40|$|The {{current study}} was {{exploratory}} and represents a first attempt at a standardized method for digital forensics event reconstruction based on statistical significance at a given error rate (α =. 01). The study used four scenarios to test the ability to determine whether contraband images located on a system running Windows XP were intentionally downloaded or downloaded without the user’s consent or knowledge. Seven characteristics or system variables were identified for comparison; using a stepwise discriminant analysis, the seven characteristics were reduced to four. It was determined that a model consisting of two characteristics [...] {{the average of the}} difference between file <b>creation</b> <b>times</b> and the median of the difference between file <b>creation</b> <b>times</b> [...] was the best model for discriminating the intentional action at α =. 01. The implications of this finding and suggestions for future research are discussed...|$|R

25|$|The OPERA team {{analyzed}} {{the results in}} different ways and using different experimental methods. Following the initial main analysis released in September, three further analyses were made public in November. In the main November analysis, all the existing data were reanalyzed to allow adjustments for other factors, such as the Sagnac effect in which the Earth's rotation affects the distance traveled by the neutrinos. Then an alternative analysis adopted a different model for the matching of the neutrinos to their <b>creation</b> <b>time.</b> The third analysis of November focused on a different experimental setup ('the rerun') which changed the way the neutrinos were created.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiment}} {{created a}} form of neutrinos, muon neutrinos, at CERN's older SPS accelerator, on the Franco–Swiss border, and detected them at the LNGS lab in Gran Sasso, Italy. OPERA researchers used common-view GPS, derived from standard GPS, to measure the times and place coordinates at which the neutrinos were created and detected. As computed, the neutrinos' average time of flight {{turned out to be}} less than what light would need to travel the same distance in a vacuum. In a two-week span up to , the OPERA team repeated the measurement with a different way of generating neutrinos, which helped measure travel time of each detected neutrino separately. This eliminated some possible errors related to matching detected neutrinos to their <b>creation</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
25|$|With Oracle Solaris, the {{encryption}} capability in ZFS {{is embedded}} into the I/O pipeline. During writes, a block may be compressed, encrypted, checksummed and then deduplicated, in that order. The policy for encryption {{is set at}} the dataset level when datasets (file systems or ZVOLs) are created. The wrapping keys provided by the user/administrator can be changed at any time without taking the file system offline. The default behaviour is for the wrapping key to be inherited by any child data sets. The data encryption keys are randomly generated at dataset <b>creation</b> <b>time.</b> Only descendant datasets (snapshots and clones) share data encryption keys. A command {{to switch to a}} new data encryption key for the clone or at any time is provided—this does not re-encrypt already existing data, instead utilising an encrypted master-key mechanism.|$|E

25|$|Characters {{have five}} characteristics, Strength, Dexterity, Willpower, Perception, and Intelligence, ranging from 5 to 15, and bought at <b>creation</b> <b>time</b> with Generation Points. Remaining Generation Points {{are used to}} buy skill levels, and the {{physical}} aspects of height, weight and appearance (attractiveness). As characters {{are supposed to be}} secret agents, the less unusual a character's appearance is, the more generation points it costs; distinctive appearances stand out, and earn a character Fame Points which make others, especially villains, notice them more. There are optional rules for character Weaknesses, which gain generation points at the expense of disadvantages, usually psychological (such as Fear of , Superstition, or James Bond's own Attraction to Members of the Opposite Sex), and Fields of Experience, which gains Generation Points simulating a specific prior character history before becoming an operative, at the expense of greater age, and Fame points.|$|E

Our approach achieves a desired clustering quality with less data, resulting in a decrease in cluster <b>creation</b> <b>times.</b> ...|$|R
