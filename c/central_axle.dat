5|$|As protons {{cross the}} {{membrane}} through the channel {{in the base}} of ATP synthase, the FO proton-driven motor rotates. Rotation might be caused by changes in the ionization of amino acids in the ring of c subunits causing electrostatic interactions that propel the ring of c subunits past the proton channel. This rotating ring in turn drives the rotation of the <b>central</b> <b>axle</b> (the γ subunit stalk) within the α and β subunits. The α and β subunits are prevented from rotating themselves by the side-arm, which acts as a stator. This movement of the tip of the γ subunit within the ball of α and β subunits provides the energy for the active sites in the β subunits to undergo a cycle of movements that produces and then releases ATP.|$|E

A second order in the same series requested a shorter gear ratio (29/103) and larger air intakes, which caused an increase in weight of four tons.The second series (81 units) differed in the removal of the frontal bonnets, replaced by a more profiled driving cabin: this set a style which was adopted for all the following Italian locomotives. A third order was issued on April 5, 1939 for 80 locomotives, but the construction was halted by the outbreak of World War II after the completion of 39 units.

50|$|The V1 domain is {{responsible}} for ATP hydrolysis, whereas the Vo domain {{is responsible}} for proton translocation. ATP hydrolysis at the catalytic nucleotide binding sites on subunit A drives rotation of a central stalk composed of subunits D and F, which in turn drives rotation of a barrel of c subunits relative to the a subunit. The complex structure of the V-ATPase has been revealed through {{the structure of the}} M. Sexta and Yeast complexes that were solved by single-particle cryo-EM and negative staining, respectively (Muench 2009, Diepholz 2008, Zhang 2008). These structures have revealed that the V-ATPase has a 3-stator network, linked by a collar of density formed by the C, H, and a subunits, which, while dividing the V1 and V0 domains, make no interactions with the <b>central</b> rotor <b>axle</b> formed by the F, D, and d subunits. Rotation of this <b>central</b> rotor <b>axle</b> caused by the hydrolysis of ATP within the catalytic AB domains results in the movement of the barrel of c subunits past the a subunit, which drives proton transport across the membrane. A stoichiometry of two protons translocated for each ATP hydrolyzed has been proposed by (Johnson, 1982).|$|R

The large central gear is fitted loosely over the axle at its machine-room end and fixed in place prevent it from rotating. The two smaller gears are fixed to each of the arms of the wheel at its machine-room end. When the motors rotate the <b>central</b> <b>axle,</b> the arms swing and the small gears engage the central gear, which results in the smaller gears rotating at a higher speed than the wheel but in the same direction. The smaller gears engage the large ring gears {{at the end of the}} caissons, driving them at the same speed as the wheel but in the opposite direction. This cancels the rotation due to the arms and keeps the caissons stable and perfectly level.|$|E

Four types of logging locomotives were utilized {{in the early twentieth}} century: the common rod engine, the Shay, the Heisler, and the Climax locomotives. The rod configuration has steam pistons which actuate rods attached to the wheels which, in turn, provide locomotion. The Shay configured geared-locomotive had two or more pistons that are mounted perpendicular to the boiler. Instead of actuating rods for locomotion, the pistons turned a crankshaft which ran the length of the engine on one side and engaged each of the wheels with a crown gear. The Heisler configured geared-locomotive always had two pistons cradling the boiler and is mounted to a <b>central</b> <b>axle.</b> This <b>central</b> <b>axle</b> was attached to the locomotive wheels much like a modern truck. The rarest of the logging locomotives is the Climax configured geared-locomotive. Climax locomotives have pistons that flank the boiler at a 45-degree angle. These pistons turn a flywheel which is connected to a <b>central</b> <b>axle,</b> thus providing locomotion. All of these geared locomotives are rare but there are only three Climax engines that can be seen today in working order.|$|E

40|$|Rotary ATPases are {{involved}} in numerous physiological processes, with the three distinct types (F/A/V-ATPases) sharing functional properties and structural features. The basic mechanism involves the counter rotation of two motors, a soluble ATP hydrolyzing/synthesizing domain and a membrane-embedded ion pump connected through a <b>central</b> rotor <b>axle</b> and a stator complex. Within the A/V-ATPase family conformational flexibility of the EG stators {{has been shown to}} accommodates catalytic cycling and is considered to be important to function. For the A-ATPase three EG structures have been reported, thought to represent conformational states of the stator during different stages of rotary catalysis. Here we use long, detailed atomistic simulations to show that those structures are conformers explored through thermal fluctuations, but do not represent highly populated states of the EG stator in solution. We show that the coiled coil tail domain has a high persistence length (∼ 100 nm), but retains the ability to adapt to different conformational states through the presence of two hinge regions. Moreover, the stator network of the related V-ATPase has been suggested to adapt to subunit interactions in the collar region and not the nucleotide occupancy of the catalytic domain. The MD simulations reported here, reinforce this observation showing that the EG stators have enough plasticity to adapt to significantly different structural re-arrangements and accommodate structural changes in the catalytic domain whilst resisting the large torque generated by catalytic cycling. These results are important to understand the role the stators play in the rotary-ATPase mechanism...|$|R

Either as single chains or complexes of associated units, proteins participate in every biological process with a specific structural and/or functional role. Ion-pumping rotary ATPases is a large family of important membrane-bound protein nanomachines. In the current work we investigate structural and dynamical aspects of the A- and V-type rotary ATPases, related to functional dynamics, and propose a multiscale computational framework for their in-silico biophysical characterisation and the interpretation of low-resolution experimental data from electron microscopy in Chapter 3. For {{the first time we}} present results from explicit-solvent atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the prokaryotic A-type peripheral stator stalk and <b>central</b> rotor <b>axle,</b> both being critical subunits involved in the mechanical coupling of the rotary ATPases in Chapter 4.

Overall, the wealth of information accessed with molecular-dynamics simulations allows the exploitation of atomistic information within the multiscale framework of Chapter 3 to be applied for the mechanical characterisation of rotary ATPases in future studies. In particular, atomistic data could serve as high-resolution information for future parameterisation of simplified coarse-grain models for all ATPase subunits and the construction of molecular models for the intact ATPases.

40|$|Hardening distortions are {{unwanted}} {{changes in}} shape and dimension that arise during hardening of steel components. Uncontrolled distortions induce random errors to the manufacturing process, and have a strong negative impact on manufacturing costs. The distortions are not only caused by the hardening process, several factors from previous manufacturing steps including the component geometry itself contribute to varying extent. The aim of the current work is to investigate the main influencing factors on hardening distortions for serial produced gears. The investigations were done on {{two different types of}} gears for heavy-duty transmissions, crown wheels for the rear <b>axle</b> <b>central</b> gear and main shaft gears for the gearbox. The steel was produced using either continuous casting or ingot casting. For rectangular continuously cast steel, the effect of disabling magnetic stirring of the steel melt during casting was investigated, finding a strong reduction of gear runout for crown wheels. Segregations in crown wheels produced from {{the top and bottom of}} ingots were shown to go in opposite directions, producing opposite back-face tilts. For crown wheels quenched one at a time, influences of stacking level on the hardening tray were found, indicating an impact from small variations in the carburizing process, despite identical quenching conditions. For main shaft gears, horizontal loading gave considerably less roundness and runout errors but increased flatness errors compared to vertical loading. This thesis shows the complexity of the distortion phenomenon and how several factors interact and contribute to the final result. It is shown that factors with significant impact on hardening distortions for one component may be less important for another component. With this in mind, each type of component to be hardened should be produced by a manufacturing chain where each process step is carefully chosen with respect to minimizing distortions.

2500|$|The twelve aluminium-bodied {{motor cars}} were ordered from Cravens in 1958, and each was {{equipped}} with four traction motors, instead of the two which previous stock had used. They were controlled by a Pneumatic Camshaft Motor (PCM) controller, where an air-operated camshaft controlled the switching of the motors, which was itself governed by an accelerating relay. This system had proved reliable in the control of two motors. In order for it to control four, without a major re-design, pairs of motors were wired together in series, and the controller switched between all four motors operating in series, and the two pairs operating in parallel. In order to protect against wheel-spin, the contoller automatically reset if one motor of a pair began to run faster than the other. Whereas previous bogies had been asymmetric, to ensure that more weight was carried by the axle driven by the motor, the pivot was <b>central</b> as every <b>axle</b> carried a motor. One further innovation was that the fully automatic couplers at the outer ends of the trains were not [...] "handed". Previously, trains were designated with 'A' and 'D' ends, and could only be coupled together by joining an 'A' end of one train to a 'D' end of another. This could cause operational problems, particularly on a line such as the Central, where operating a train right round the Hainualt loop resulted in it facing the wrong way. The 1960 stock avoided this problem by duplicating most of the connections in the automatic coupler, so that trains could be joined either way round. The cars also included a flat floor for the first time, rather than having a raised section over the motor bogies.(previous stock from 1935 to 1962 had flat floors at the centre section only, with a rising transition in the two double doorways to a steeply curved floor 4 inches higher at either end over the bogies).|$|R
