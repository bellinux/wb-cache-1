5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{emerge as}} {{branches of the}} left and right subclavian arteries. They travel upward through transverse foramina – spaces in the cervical vertebrae and then emerge as two vessels, one on the left and one on the right of the medulla. They give off one of the three cerebellar branches. The vertebral arteries join in front of the middle part of the medulla to form the larger basilar artery, which sends multiple branches to supply the medulla and pons, and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches. Finally, the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries. These travel outwards, around the superior cerebellar peduncles, and {{along the top of the}} cerebellar tentorium, where it sends branches to supply the temporal and occipital lobes. Each posterior <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with the internal carotid arteries.|$|E

We have tested the hypothesis that large <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> contribute to regulation of cerebral blood flow during changes in blood gases and arterial pressure. Microspheres were used to measure brain blood flow in anesthetized dogs. Resistance of large <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> was estimated by determining the pressure gradient between common carotid and wedged vertebral artery catheters. Systemic hypercapnia and hypoxia dilated large <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries,</b> and hypocapnia constricted large <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries.</b> Resistance of large arteries was 0. 6 ± 0. 1 (mean ± SE) mm Hg per ml/min per 100 g during normocapnia. During hypercapnia and hypoxia, large artery resistance decreased significantly to 0. 2 ± 0. 03 and 0. 3 ± 0. 05, respectively. During hypocapnia large artery resistance increased significantly to 1. 0 ± 0. 1. In other experiments, we found that large <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> participate in auto-regulatory responses to hemorrhagic hypotension. When arterial pressure was reduced from 110 to 58 mm Hg, autoregulation maintained cerebral blood flow constant, and resistance of large <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> decreased significantly from 1. 0 ± 0. 2 to 0. 6 ± 0. 1 mm Hg per ml/min per 100 g. In absolute terms, we calculated that 20 - 45 % {{of the change in}} total cerebral resistance during these interventions was accounted for by changes in large artery resistance. These studies indicate that large <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries,</b> as well as arterioles, participate actively in regulation of cerebral blood flow during changes in arterial blood gases and during autoregulatory responses to hemorrhagic hypotension...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Various {{concentrations}} of acetylcholine (ACh) produced dose dependent relaxations of iso-lated, helical preparations of human <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> and these responses were blocked by atropine. The median effective concentration (EC^,) of ACh was 6. 1 ± 0. 2 x 10 ~'M. ACh produced dual responses in isolated dog <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries.</b> ACh in low concentrations produced relaxation, and contraction {{occurred when the}} concentration was raised to 1 x 10 "JM. The EC^, of ACh which produced relaxation, in dog <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> was 7. 2 ± 0. 2 x KT'M. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors in these arteries were analyzed directly using 3 H-QNB as the ligand. The specific 3 H-QNB binding to the arteries was saturable and of KD = 1. 5 nM and Bmax = 93 fmol/mg protein in human <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> and KD = 0. 59 nM, Bmax = 340 fmol/mg protein in dog <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries.</b> Specific binding of 3 H-QNB was displaced by muscarinic choliner-gic agents.

In vitro studies using synthetic K-ATP channel openers suggest that the pharmacological profiles differ between rat basilar arteries and rat middle <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries.</b> To address this issue, we studied the possible involvement of endothelial K-ATP channels by pressurized arteriography after luminal administration of synthetic K-ATP channel openers to rat basilar and middle <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries.</b> Furthermore, we examined the mRNA and protein expression profile of K-ATP channels to rat basilar and middle <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> using quantitative real-time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and Western blotting, respectively. In the per-fusion system, we found no significant responses after luminal application of three K-ATP channel openers to rat basilar and middle <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries.</b> In contrast, abluminal application caused a concentration-dependent dilatation of both arteries, that was more potent in basilar than in middle <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries.</b> Quantitative real-time PCR detected the presence of mRNA transcripts of the K-ATP channel subunits Kir 6. 1, Kir 6. 2, SUR 1 and SLTR 2 B, while SUR 2 A mRNA was barely detected in both rat basilar and middle <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries.</b> Of the five mRNAs, the expression levels of Kir 6. 1 and SUR 2 B transcripts were predominant in both rat basilar and middle <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries.</b> Western blotting detected the presence of Kir 6. 1, Kir 6. 2, SUR 1 and SUR 2 B proteins in both arteries. Densitometric measurements of the Western blot signals further showed higher expression levels of Kir 6. 1 and SUR 2 B proteins in rat middle <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> than was found in rat basilar arteries.

5|$|The {{internal}} carotid arteries are {{branches of}} the common carotid arteries.

These branches travel forward and then upward along the longitudinal fissure, and supply the front and midline parts of the brain. One or more small anterior communicating arteries join the two anterior <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> shortly after they emerge as branches.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE-: We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that elevated superoxide production by Nox 2 -NADPH oxidase occurs in <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> during hypercholesterolemia and causes decreased nitric oxide function. METHODS-: Wild-type (WT), apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE) and Nox 2 /ApoE mice were fed a high-fat diet for 7 to 14 weeks.

Western blotting {{was used to measure}} protein expression of Nox 2, p 47 phox, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and superoxide dismutases (1 - 3). RESULTS-: Morphology of <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> was similar in WT and ApoE mice. In ApoE, but not Nox 2 /ApoE mice, superoxide production by <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> was approximately 50 % greater than in WT mice (P< 0. 05). Moreover, the magnitude of l-NAME-induced contractions of isolated middle <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> from ApoE mice was < 50 % of that in WT mice (P< 0. 05), whereas in Nox 2 /ApoE mice, the contractile response was comparable to WT responses. In the presence of the superoxide scavenger, tempol (1 mmol/L), l-NAME-induced contractions of middle <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> were similar between WT and ApoE mice. Expression of p 47 phox was approximately 2 -fold higher in ApoE versus WT mice, whereas Nox 2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and superoxide dismutase isoforms were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS-: Elevated superoxide production and reduced basal nitric oxide-mediated relaxation occur in <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> of hypercholesterolemic mice {{even in the absence of}} lesions. These changes appear to be exclusively due to increased activity of Nox 2 -NADPH oxidase, possibly through increased expression of its regulatory subunit p 47 phox...|$|R

25|$|Consistent with hemispheric lateralization, {{there is}} {{evidence}} to suggest that the left and right hemispheres of the brain are responsible for different components of musical memory. By studying the learning curves of patients who have had damage to either their left or right medial temporal lobes, Wilson & Saling (2008) found hemispheric differences in the contributions of the left and right medial temporal lobes in melodic memory. Ayotte, Peretz, Rousseau, Bard & Bojanowski (2000) found that those patients who had their left middle <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> cut in response to an aneurysm suffered greater impairments when performing tasks of musical long term memory, than those patients who had their right middle <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> cut. Thus, they concluded that the left hemisphere is mainly important for musical representation in long term memory, whereas the right is needed primarily to mediate access to this memory. Sampson and Zatorre (1991) studied patients with severe epilepsy who underwent surgery for relief as well as control subjects. They found deficits in memory recognition for text regardless of whether it was sung or spoken after a left, but not right temporal lobectomy. However, melody recognition when a tune was sung with new words (as compared to encoding) was impaired after either right or left temporal lobectomy. Finally, after a right but not left temporal lobectomy, impairments of melody recognition occurred in the absence of lyrics. This suggests dual memory codes for musical memory, with the verbal code utilizing the left temporal lobe structures and the melodic relying on the encoding involved.|$|E

A recent study was conducted to investigate the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie acquired amusia and contribute to its recovery. The study was performed on 53 stroke patients with a left or right hemisphere middle <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> (MCA) infarction one week, three months, and six months after the stroke occurred.

500|$|In general, the {{decision}} between clipping and coiling is {{made on the}} basis of the location of the aneurysm, its size and the condition of the person. Aneurysms of the middle <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> and its related vessels are hard to reach with angiography and tend to be amenable to clipping. Those of the basilar artery and posterior <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> are hard to reach surgically and are more accessible for endovascular management. These approaches are based on general experience, and the only randomized controlled trial directly comparing the different modalities was performed in relatively well people with small (less than 10mm) aneurysms of the anterior <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> and anterior communicating artery (together the [...] "anterior circulation"), who constitute about 20 percent of all people with aneurysmal SAH. This trial, the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT), showed that in this group the likelihood of death or being dependent on others for activities of daily living was reduced (7.4 percent absolute risk reduction, 23.5 percent relative risk reduction) if endovascular coiling was used as opposed to surgery. The main drawback of coiling is the possibility that the aneurysm will recur; this risk is extremely small in the surgical approach. In ISAT, 8.3 percent needed further treatment in the longer term. Hence, people who have undergone coiling are typically followed up for many years afterwards with angiography or other measures to ensure recurrence of aneurysms is identified early. Other trials have also found a higher rate of recurrence necessitating further treatments.|$|E
