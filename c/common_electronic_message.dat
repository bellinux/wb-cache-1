50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>message</b> {{journaling}} is {{the process}} of retaining information relating to <b>electronic</b> <b>messages.</b> In this context, <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> are defined as any type of electronic communication data structure. Historically this was an electronic mail, but it may also include instant messages, audio messages (such as those in VoIP), text messages, facsimile messages, or other user collaboration protocol data structures. Beginning about 2005 <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> began to include social media that included user-generated content such as blogs, discussion forums, posts, chats, tweets, podcasting, pins, digital images, video and audio files. Several implementation variations exist, altering when, what, and how information is retained.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{social and}} nonsocial uses of <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> systems, their determinants, and their impacts on direction of communication, perceived quality of work, and decision-making. A {{survey was conducted}} in 1992 in the headquarters of a large, geographically dispersed telecommunications company in Maryland which used an in-house electronic mail system. The findings showed that <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> were not widely used for socioemotional purposes but were certainly more common among certain groups. Messages pertaining to socioemotional content were generally avoided in downward and diagonal communication. Younger employees {{who had worked for}} the organiza-tion for a shorter period of time and were holding lower level jobs were more likely to communicate socioemotional content via <b>electronic</b> <b>messages.</b> These people were less often involved in the decision-making process and felt they did not make effective decisions. However, socioemotional use was positively related to perceived quality of work. Consistent with previous studies, upper managers tended to use <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> for routine tasks. When time pressure was involved, <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> would be used for complex tasks. Studies have shown a considerable amount of socioemotional con-tent in text-based, <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> (Hiemstra, 1982; Phillips, 1983; Rice & Love, 1987; Steinfield, 1986 a) regardless of their imper-sonal nature claimed by many researchers (Daft & Lengel, 1984...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>electronic</b> patient-provider <b>messaging</b> is associated with high care quality for diabetes and lower outpatient utilization. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of <b>electronic</b> patient-provider <b>messaging</b> over a 15 -month period between 1 January 2004 and 31 March 2005. The study was set at Group Health Cooperative—a consumer-governed, nonprofit health care system that operates in Washington and Idaho. Participants included all patients aged � 18 years with a diagnosis of diabetes. In addition to usual care, all patients had the option to use <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> to communicate with their care providers. The primary outcome measures were diabetes-related quality-of-care indicators (A 1 C, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol) and outpatient visits (primary care, specialty care, and emergency). RESULTS — Nineteen percent of patients with diabetes used <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> to communicate with their care providers {{during the study period}} (n � 2, 924) (overall study cohort: 15, 427 subjects). In multivariate models, frequent use of <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> was associated with A 1 C � 7 % (relative risk [RR] 1. 36 [95 % CI 1. 16 – 1. 58]). Contrary to our hypothesis, frequent use of <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> was also associated with a higher rate of outpatient visit...|$|R

40|$|Introduction  Research {{suggests}} that <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> can improve patient engagement. Studies {{indicate that a}} ‘digital divide’ may exist, where certain patient populations may be using <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> less frequently. This study aims to determine which patient characteristics are associated with different levels of usage of an <b>electronic</b> patient-provider <b>messaging</b> system in a diverse urban population. Methods  Cross-sectional electronic health record data were extracted for patients 10 {{years of age or}} older who live in New York City and who visited a set of clinics between 1 July 2011 and 30 June 2012. Regression analyses determined which participant characteristics were associated with the sending of <b>electronic</b> <b>messages.</b> Results  Older, female, English-speaking participants of white race who received more messages, had any diagnoses, more office visits and a provider who sent messages were more likely to send more messages. Non-Millennial, non-white participants who received fewer messages, had more office visits, any diagnoses, a provider who saw fewer patients with patient portal accounts, lived in a low socioeconomic status neighbourhood, and did not have private insurance were more likely to send zero messages. Conclusion  This study found significant differences in <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> usage based on demographic, socioeconomic and health-related patient characteristics. Future studies are needed to support these results and determine the causes of observed associations. </p...|$|R

40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{explore how}} {{the use of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> support {{hospital}} and community care nurses’ collaboration and communication concerning patients’ admittance to and discharges from hospitals. Background: Nurses in hospitals and in community care {{play a crucial role}} in the transfer of patients between the home and the hospital. Several studies have shown that transition situations are challenging due to a lack of communication and information exchange. Information and communication technologies may support nurses’ work in these transition situations. An <b>electronic</b> <b>message</b> system was introduced in Norway to support patient transitions across the health care sector. Design: A descriptive, qualitative interview study was conducted. Methods: One hospital and three adjacent communities were included in the study. We conducted semi-structured interviews with hospital nurses and community care nurses. In total, 41 persons were included in the study. The analysis stemmed from three main topics related to the aims of e-messaging: efficiency, quality and safety. These were further divided into sub-themes. Results: All informants agreed that <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> is more efficient, i. e. less time-consuming than previous means of communication. The shift from predominantly oral communication to writing <b>electronic</b> <b>messages</b> has brought attention to the content of the information exchanged, thereby leading to more conscious communication. <b>Electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> enables improved information security, thereby enhancing patient safety, but this depends on nurses using the system as intended. Conclusion: Nurses consider <b>electronic</b> <b>messaging</b> to be a useful tool for communication and collaboration in patient transitions. Relevance to clinical practice: Patient transitions are demanding situations both for patients and for the nurses who facilitate the transitions. The introduction of information and communication technologies can support nurses’ work in the transition situations, and this is likely to benefit the patients...|$|R
