Documentary review and interviews were the primary method drawing on actors involved both in the two case studies, and within the EU. The results indicate that transactive and substantive effectiveness are intrinsically linked and that both cases demonstrated some substantive effectiveness, but only one was transactively effective. Effectiveness was judged to be a function of design, procedure, substance as well as transaction, influenced by political issues. As with other research, we find that perspectives of effectiveness are very much driven by individual expectations, suggesting that a true measure of effectiveness might be the extent to which SEA can change expectations...|$|E

40|$|The {{aspiration}} {{to integrate}} environmental concerns into {{all areas of}} policy has long served as a rhetorical reference point in the environmental debate. But only recently has the objective of environmental policy integration (EPI) been tackled through serious institutional reforms. Although {{this has led to}} a rise of academic interest in the issue, much conceptual work on EPI remains to be done. This paper draws on the policy studies literature on ecological modernization to develop a framework for the analysis and evaluation of institutional strategies for EPI, arguing that they can be fruitfully evaluated on the basis of four specific functions of EPI: agenda setting, horizontal communication, capacity building and policy learning. The application of the framework to the <b>Cardiff</b> <b>process</b> in EU enterprise policy shows that its impact has varied in relation to different functions of integration...|$|E

In the past, the main instrument used to integrate environmental concerns into other sectors was regulation. But in the 1990 s, the <b>Cardiff</b> <b>Process</b> was established at EU level to promote a newer and more network-based approach to delivering this objective. Drawing upon an analysis of how well national administrative systems have responded to the demands associated with networks, it argues that both the 'old' and the 'new' instruments of governance are reliant on the presence of sufficient administrative capacities. It concludes that decision-makers in the EU have traded the 'old' governance of regulation for the 'new' governance of networks without sufficiently diagnosing the administrative demands associated with either...|$|E
40|$|This is a draft. Comments welcome. Please do not cite-Environmental {{protection}} {{has long}} been established as an important state goal by countries across the globe. Nonetheless, {{the extent to which}} states have actually and effectively integrated environmental concerns across all government activity appears to be partial at best. This paper inquires into the sources of success and failure of environmental policy integration (EPI) – a strategy heavily promoted by the EU through the <b>Cardiff</b> <b>Process</b> as key instruments in furthering environmental sustainability and protection. Environmental movements had, of course, advocated for such an approach since at least the early 1970 s. EPI entails the integration of environmental concerns into all policy areas in order to design and defend policies that increase environmental protection while decreasing the likelihood of conflicting governmental policies. It operates vertically and horizontally and challenges traditional thinking of policy-makers, while remaining reconcilable with rational bureaucratic and state decision-making. As a set of institutional adjustments to the policy-process, I argue, EPI can represent a means of democratization in advanced industrial societies and elsewhere in both procedural an...|$|E

Gradually a rather complicated mechanism has evolved aiming to combine and complement policies pursued at EU level with policies conducted at Member countries level. In the paper the legal framework of the economic policy coordination is presented, main instruments and methods described and assessed. Among the instruments discussed {{attention is paid to}} the Main Economic Policy Guidelines, Employment Guidelines, <b>Cardiff</b> <b>process,</b> Cologne process, Lisbon process and the Stability and Growth Pact. All these instruments have something in common : they are based on consensus and include recommendations to the Member states, which, however, cannot be enforced, except for the fiscal policy framework. The Stability and Growth Pact is the only instrument making it legally possible putting sanctions against a non-complying country, non-respecting the rules of the Pact. As yet the Community does not possess any mechanism securing that the Member countries follow the recommended reforms. The main contribution of the economic policy coordination can be found in that it supports the mutual learning process. monetary policy; fiscal policy; {{coordination of}} economic policies...|$|E

The particular experience of EMU with a sound money, sound finance paradigm, a long history of project-building by key elites and the central role of the European Council suggest similar conditions are required for the effective application of the method in other policy spheres. The context within which the method has operated to date is contingent and could change either over time or between policy fields.

40|$|The project 'Sustainable {{agriculture}} and soil conservation' (SoCo) analysed {{the links between}} soil degradation processes, soil-friendly farming practices, and relevant policy measures in EU agriculture. The policy information {{was based on a}} literature review and a survey monitoring national and regional policy implementation, supplemented with details from ten case studies across the EU- 27. To date, soil protection is not a specific objective of EU legislation; in order to close this gap, the Commission proposed a Soil Framework Directive which is still under discussion. Currently, some EU environmental directives are expected to have beneficial effects on soil quality (e. g. the Nitrates Directive), but to a limited extent owing to a more focused set of objectives. Parallel, environmental objectives are to be integrated in EU sectoral policies (<b>Cardiff</b> <b>process),</b> including the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), where cross compliance and rural development measures stand out as important instruments. The study indicated that the existing policy measures have the potential to address all recognised soil degradation processes across the EU, even though not all policy measures are implemented in all Member States or regions. At present, their effectiveness for soil quality improvement is limited due to: the lack of specified reference and target levels and specific targeting of policies, as well as missing coordination between existing measures. Finally, a fully-fledged evaluation of policies will only be possible once indicators and consistent monitoring are established. JRC. J. 5 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|E
40|$|Environmental policy {{provides}} one of {{the oldest}} and most puzzling cases of policy coordination in the European Union (EU). The integration (or mainstreaming) of environmental objectives into non environmental policies such as agriculture, energy and transport, has a long history and commands high level political support among heads of state. However, the implementation of environmental policy integration (EPI) has not yet matched these ambitions. One of the main problems is that EPI has been seen as a macro problem of drafting sweeping statements and writing long term integration strategies. The need to embed EPI in micro policy processes i. e. the bottom-up formulation and implementation of EU policies in administrative settings has, however, mostly been ignored. This paper analyses the administrative coordination mechanisms at the micro-level within the Commission, the Netherlands and UK governments to gauge how fit they are to deliver on the EUs broader EPI objective. Using different theories of coordination, this paper concludes that all three have relied too heavily on setting long term coordination targets, without putting in place the administrative coordination (i. e. delivery) mechanisms. This paper concludes that the EUs macro approach (dubbed the <b>Cardiff</b> <b>process)</b> cannot perform effectively without the support of implementing actions at the micro level. At the same time, activities at the micro level need the political commitment expressed at the macro level. Moreover, environmental information needs to be transferred within and between the actors in a much more active manner so that environmental impacts can be designed out of policy proposals early on in the policy process. The conclusion of this study is that, in the face of greater interdependence between policies and the concomitant demand for greater policy coordination, passive coordination has had its day. But for many different reasons, the actors have not yet come to grips with what is required to implement active coordination...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{development}} is a cross-cutting issue par excellence that is thought to require {{a high level of}} policy coordination. This is especially true considering that the European Union (EU) has also accepted that its internal policies must support the sustainable development of other countries, particularly developing countries. The EU is increasingly employing new modes of governance to achieve this, in particular network-based policy coordination mechanisms. However, despite a raft of literature on policy networks in the EU, the majority of the empirical work has focused only on sectoral networks. This has led to an ambiguity surrounding the use of networks in governing cross-cutting policy areas, which this thesis attempts to address. Specifically, the assumption that networks are always self-steering is tested. Elite interviews and documentary analysis are used to complete three tasks. First, the general patterns of coordination of the external dimension ofEU sustainable development in three network-based policy coordination mechanisms are examined, namely the <b>Cardiff</b> <b>process,</b> Impact Assessment and Thematic Strategies. Next, three in-depth case studies are presented, namely mercury, sugar and tobacco policy. Then, the observed pattern and level ofcoordination is discussed using an analytical framework which distinguishes two types ofpolicy networks: intra-sector and inter-sector. This thesis arrives at four main findings. First, it confirms that the external dimension has. often been neglected in the EU's implementation of sustainable development. Second, the presence of networks does not necessarily lead to effective coordination. Sector networks can actually inhibit horizontal coordination where as inter-sector networks are needed for the coordination of cross-cutting policy issues. Third, contrary to the assumptions of some authors, inter-sector networks are not always self-steering. Finally, network-based coordination mechanisms are not a sufficient condition for networks to form. It is necessary for effective networks to already be in place if these mechanisms are to function effectively. Consequently, this thesis concludes that, if the EU is to continue to use networks in its approach to governing, it must be prepared to engage in a greater amount of hands-on management of these networks.

40|$|Introduction by Mark A. Pollack, series editor]. THE PORTUGUESE PRESIDENCY, WHICH {{organized}} {{the work of}} the Council during {{the first six months of}} the year, was tasked with the heavy responsibility of organizing the opening months of the 2000 IGC (see Dinan and Vanhoonacker, this issue), yet the Portuguese also embarked on a major campaign to sponsor an academic and political debate on economic reform, and on the future of European economic governance. Throughout their presidency, the Portuguese sought to stimulate a debate on both the substance and process of European economic policymaking, proposing a "new strategic goal for the Union in order to strengthen employment, economic reform and social cohesion as part of a knowledge-based economy. " Toward this end, the presidency commissioned a series of papers from both distinguished academics and EU institutions on subjects ranging from employment policy to the reform of the welfare state, modernization of public services, social inclusion, and the information society and e-commerce (for an on-line listing and texts of these reports, see Portuguese Presidency 2000). In March, the presidency organized a special European Council, which largely endorsed the Portuguese program of economic reform, with particularly detailed statements on the information society and the promotion of e-commerce. As important as the substance of the proposed reforms, however, is the process proposed by the Portuguese presidency, and endorsed by the Lisbon European Council, dubbed "open coordination. " As Jim Mosher explains below, open coordination involves the establishment of common social policy guidelines, indicators and "benchmarks," which are intended to guide national policies through a process of policy coordination and peer evaluation. Although the practice of open coordination is not itself new, having been pioneered in recent years in a trio of joint policy processes (namely the Luxembourg Process on employment, the <b>Cardiff</b> <b>process</b> on structural reforms, and the Cologne process on macroeconomic policy coordination), the explicit endorsement of open coordination in Lisbon raises a number of important questions about the future of European economic governance, which are addressed by three ECSA members in this Forum. In the first essay, Martin Rhodes analyzes the outcome of the Lisbon European Council as a pragmatic effort by the EU to find a "Third Way" between the traditionally conflicting imperatives of economic efficiency and equality, and between the extremes of European harmonization and national autonomy. In the process, he suggests, the presidency has created a "new European architecture for social policy" which will rationalize existing processes under the umbrella of a broader economic strategy and an annual Spring meeting of the European Council. In the second essay, Janine Goetschy looks back at the record of open coordination in the most developed of the three current processes, the European Employment Strategy, noting both the strengths and the weaknesses of the process during its formative years. In the third and final essay, Jim Mosher places the emerging process of open coordination in the context of a broader move to "post-regulatory governance," which promises both functional and political advantages to member governments eager to cooperate in a flexible fashion, but also the familiar dangers of "voluntarism" and weak or uneven national implementation of common EU goals. Despite differences in emphasis and in levels of optimism about the future, all three essays echo Rhodes' conclusion that the Lisbon European Council is likely to emerge as a watershed in EU social policy, in terms of both the articulation of a new set of common policy goals for the member states, and the endorsement of new policy processes which may-or may not-serve to facilitate the achievement of those goals in the coming years...|$|E
40|$|The Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is an {{economic}} and monetary policy system based on a fundamental asymmetry and consisting of three elements: 1. an independent central bank (ECB) which is exclusively charged with monetary policy in the euro zone; 2. economic policies (fiscal and budgetary policies) which continue to be pursued individually at member state level but which are subject to specified common rules (specifically the stability and growth pact (SGP), the procedure {{in the case of}} an excessive deficit and the acquis communautaire of the single market); and, finally, 3. recognition that economic policies by the member states are a matter of "common concern" which consequently need some amount of co-ordination at Council level. The ECB pursues its monetary policy at central level for all members of the euro zone. Its primary objective is to achieve price stability in the euro zone. In its monetary policy strategy, the ECB concentrates on three key elements: a quantitative definition of price stability as the chief goal of the euro system (defined by the ECB as an inflation rate of not more than 2 percent), and a "two-pillar concept". For the "first pillar", a reference value of 4. 5 percent was specified for the growth of the money supply (M 3). The "second pillar" includes a whole bundle of business indicators in order to obtain adequate forecasts of inflation. In spite of an unfavourable international situation (oil price shock of 2000 - 01, global recession in 2001 - 02), the ECB was successful in shaping its monetary policy. EMU has not only revolutionised monetary policy but has also left a marked impression on the fiscal stability culture in the EU. The obligation to meet the convergence criteria alone has already reduced budget deficits in the EU markedly below 3 percent of GDP. With the entry into the third stage of EMU, the trend was further enhanced, not least due to the dictates of the stability and growth pact. Whereas in 1997 (prior to EMU entry) only three of the 15 EU member states (Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg) boasted of a budget surplus, their number had grown to nine countries in 2001. This not only interrupted the dynamic growth of the national debt but also contributed to making state finances more sustainable. But although the stability and growth pact fostered greater fiscal policy discipline, it still shows its inherent weaknesses in times of weak growth or recession. With competences clearly allocated (ECB exclusively in charge of monetary policy and EU member states in charge of economic policy), economic policy needs to be co-ordinated. Over time, complex mechanisms and a number of processes have been established (Luxembourg process for employment, <b>Cardiff</b> <b>process</b> for structural policy and functioning of the single market, Cologne process for macroeconomic dialogue, Lisbon process for an open method of co-ordination). An annual rhythm of multilateral monitoring has been formed within the scope of the pact, accompanied by the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPG). It is an open issue whether this elaborate (administrative, political) process does not already cancel out possible gains of co-ordination. In view of such findings, any demand for further and stronger co-ordination made (e. g. by the Commission) to the European Convention currently discussing the future Europe would thus be rather contra productive. It is especially in comparing the USA and EU in terms of their economic performance over the past decade that an analysis of the complex economic policy interactions within EMU may well lead to the conclusion that not only are labour and capital markets in the EU still too rigid but that its economic policy is still too inflexible.
