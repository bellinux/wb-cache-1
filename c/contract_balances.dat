The optimal unemployment insurance <b>contract</b> <b>balances</b> the insurance motive to provide consumption for the un-employed with the provision of incentives {{to search for a}} job. This balance is affected by aggregate conditions, as recessions are characterized by reductions in job finding rates. We show how benefits should vary with aggregate conditions in an optimal con-tract. In a special case of the model, the optimal contract can be solved in closed form. We show how this contract can be implemented in a rather simple way: by allowing unemployed workers to borrow and save in a bond (whose return depends {{on the state of the}} economy), providing flow payments which are constant over an unemployment spell but vary with the aggregate state, and giving additional lump sum payments (or charges) upon finding a job or when the aggregate state switches. We then consider a calibrated version of the model and study the quantitative impact of changing from the current unemployment system to the optimal one. In a recession, the optimal sys-tem reduces unemployment rates by roughly 2. 5 percentage points and shortens the duration of unemployment by roughly 50 %. ...|$|E

Becket (1962) provided the classic solution for this problem when individuals and firms are risk neutral. Individuals pay the costs when they are hired, but the wages (which equal the posttraining value of their marginal product) that they are subsequently paid must be sufficiently high for the individuals to recoup these expenditures (with interest). Under these circumstances, individuals have the correct incentives for moving; when they move, their specific human capital is, in effect, destroyed; hence they should only move when the increase in their productivity, or the increment in the utility they receive from the nonpecuniary aspects of the job, at least compensates for this; when individuals have paid the training...|$|E

40|$|Cross-country {{evidence}} suggests that during recent years a large fraction of developing countries seem to began to overcome fear of oating, i. e., a lower relative volatility of exchange rates to monetary policy instruments. To explain this trend, we build a model that describes the behavior of Central Banks in developing countries under uncertainty and fear of misspecication about the eects of exchange rate depreciations. The Central Bank is uncertain about two sub-models which dier in that exchange rate depreciations can cause output either to expand (textbook eect) or <b>contract</b> (<b>balance</b> sheet eect). Optimal policy within the second sub-model is consistent with fear of floating. A feature of fear of oating is that, by preventing sizeable exchange rate swings, Central Banks could loose valuable information useful to distinguish among models. We describe how the Central Bank's {{the evolution of the}} prior depends on the optimal policy and viceversa. We conclude that the trend towards less fear of floating may not be explained by Bayesian or robust policies because it would have been too quick to explain the data.

Prior {{research suggests that the}} management aspect of inter-partner relationships is limited. There is also limits in research regarding the factors impacting how to manage inter-partner relationship and how it relates to IJV performance. The theory used for this study is an integrated framework of social exchange theory (SET) and transaction cost economics (TCE). These theories acquire two sets of mechanisms on how to manage inter-partner relationship and its impact on IJV performance: (1) social mechanisms of trust, communication, and cultural adaptation, and (2) structural mechanisms of ownership control, <b>contract,</b> <b>balanced</b> asset specificity and resource complementarity.

The most influencing factors on inter-partner management and IJV performance are trust, communication, contract and resource complementarity.

40|$|Today’s {{interdomain}} routing protocol, BGP, {{is difficult}} to manage, troubleshoot, and secure. It makes even simple network management tasks—including implementing business <b>contracts,</b> <b>balancing</b> traffic to relieve congestion, and tuning network paths to achieve good performance and high reliability—both challenging and unpredictable. The research literature is rife with proposals and protocol modifications to improve BGPs security, convergence properties, flexibility for defining contractual relationships, and traffic engineering capabilities. Unfortunately, none of these new protocols or modifications have seen any appreciable level of deployment, as they require substantial modifications to BGPs control plane, where wholesale upgrades and changes have proven difficult. Software defined networking (SDN) promises to make network protocols evolvable and flexible; that promise has certainly been fulfilled in data center networks. We posit that this new level of evolvability and flexibility may also herald a new day for interdomain routing by allowing BGPs control plane to evolve independently from the underlying switch and router hardware and bringing software control and logic to interdomain routing. We believe that the programmability that SDN offers can mitigate three problems in interdomain routing: security and accountability; pricing and contracts; and traffic management. Although global adoption of SDN faces the same problems as global changes in BGP, we think that exchange points may {{be a place where}} incremental deployment of SDN is both possible and can bring new features to interdomain routing.

40|$|Interdependent {{approach}} {{study is}} a new area in negotiation research. A negotiation approach reflects people's predisposition towards conflict resolution. Although there are five single approaches, negotiators tend to {{use a combination of}} more than one approach during the negotiation process. Traditionally, researchers use the strongest approach to represent a negotiator's approach profile. However, a negotiator's approach profile is determined typically by the combination of single approaches and the strength of their occurrence measured by the Thomas-Kilmann questionnaire. This is an exploratory study of interdependent approaches. Discovery and specification of the effectiveness of such profiles are the research focus. Approach effectiveness is discussed from two perspectives: first, the numbers of strong approaches included; and second, the profile similarity between negotiators. This study analyzes two datasets from the Inspire e-negotiation system. It shows that negotiation approaches are significantly correlated with each other and most people has one or two strong approaches.
