40|$|AbstractThe impact {{response}} of <b>civil</b> <b>aircraft</b> subject to different soft soil and concrete ground is investigated. Typical {{finite element model}} of fuselage section {{is built based on}} sound simplification. Several different soft soil and concrete impact surfaces are adopted here. The drop test of <b>civil</b> <b>aircraft</b> is conducted subject to 7 m/s impact velocity. The impact {{response of}} ground and <b>civil</b> <b>aircraft</b> are revealed. Result shows that ground material has great influence on the crashworthiness of <b>civil</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Soft soil ground could dissipate a part of impact kinetic energy, and failure element of concrete ground would be deleted. Ground with larger stiffness would absorb less internal energy and undergo smaller deformation. The relevant <b>civil</b> <b>aircraft</b> would also have larger plastic deformation, and greater initial peak acceleration would be suffered by occupant...|$|R
