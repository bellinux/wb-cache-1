40|$|We present {{our work}} on Web {{services}} with multiple classes of <b>service,</b> <b>called</b> <b>service</b> <b>offerings,</b> and on management and dynamic (i. e., runtime) adaptation of their compositions. We explain {{the motivation for}} Web services with multiple <b>service</b> <b>offerings,</b> present some management and dynamic adaptation algorithms based on the manipulation of provided <b>service</b> <b>offerings,</b> and discuss {{some of the issues}} with the corresponding management infrastructure, called DAMSC (Dynamically Adaptable and Manageable Service Compositions), that we are developing. We also briefly present our work on WSOL (Web <b>Service</b> <b>Offerings</b> Language) [...] an extension of WSDL (Web Services Description Language) that enables specification of various types of constraints [...] -functional, non-functional (QoS [...] Quality of Service), authorization policies, etc. [...] -and specification of Web services with multiple <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b> At the end, we summarize some of the challenges for future {{research in the area of}} management and dynamic adaptation of compositions of Web services...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{engineering}} and adaptation of complex e- and m-commerce systems supports business agility and flexibility. This work-in-progress paper presents research on service components with several distinct classes of <b>service,</b> <b>called</b> <b>service</b> <b>offerings,</b> and their dynamic adaptation. Having multiple <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> enables a <b>service</b> component to provide to every consumer an appropriate {{level of service}} and quality of service (QoS). It also supports different capabilities, rights, and needs of consumers of the service component. Service components and <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are described in a comprehensive XML-based specification that describes functionality, dependencies from other service components, functional and QoS constraints, authorization policies, as well as cost. Dynamic adaptation mechanisms that we explore {{are based on the}} manipulation of <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b> Our mechanisms enhance robustness of the relationship between a service component and its consumer. This robustness is important in eand m-commerce systems due to the issues of trust and customer retention. 1...|$|R
