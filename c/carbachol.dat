2500|$|In animals, the {{appearance}} of ponto-geniculo-occipital waves (PGO waves) is related {{to that of the}} bioelectric outputs of rapid eye movements. These waves are most clearly seen during the transition from non-REM to REM sleep. Although these phasic waves are observed in many portions of the animal brain, they are most noticeable in the pons, lateral geniculate bodies, and the occipital cortex. Peigneux et al., 2006, reported that the lateral geniculate nucleus and occipital cortex display higher levels of activity during REM sleep than during wakefulness. This would add to the theory that activation in these areas is similar to PGO wave activation in animals. Pontine waves are commonly seen in animals as a mechanism to help facilitate learning and memory consolidation. [...] An improvement on task performance was seen to be a result of increased P waves between REM sleep sessions. In a study using post learning REM sleep deprivation the effects of stimulating the P wave generator (located in the pontine tegmentum) of a rat were observed. Two groups of rats underwent an avoidance learning task and then allowed a sleep period while another group of rats were deprived sleep. When comparing the two groups the sleep deprived rats showed a significant deficit in learning from having not undergone REM sleep. In another rat group, the P wave generator was stimulated using a <b>carbachol</b> injection and the rats then underwent a sleep deprivation stage. When these rats were again tested on their learning it was shown that activation of the P wave generator during sleep deprivation resulted in normal learning being achieved. This would point {{to the fact that the}} activation of P waves, even without REM sleep, was enough to enhance the memory processes that would not normally have happened.|$|E
50|$|In {{the cat and}} rat, <b>carbachol</b> is {{well known}} for its ability to induce rapid eye {{movement}} (REM) sleep when microinjected into the pontine reticular formation. <b>Carbachol</b> elicits this REM sleep-like state via activation of postsynaptic muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs).|$|E

50|$|<b>Carbachol</b> is a choline {{carbamate}} and a {{positively charged}} quaternary ammonium compound. It {{is not well}} absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract and does not cross the blood-brain barrier. It is usually administered topical ocular or through intraocular injection. <b>Carbachol</b> is not easily metabolized by cholinesterase, it has a 2 to 5 minute onset of action and its duration of action is 4 to 8 hours with topical administration and 24 hours for intraocular administration. Since <b>carbachol</b> is poorly absorbed through topical administration, benzalkonium chloride is mixed in to promote absorption.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbachol</b> (Carbastat, Carboptic, Isopto <b>Carbachol,</b> Miostat), {{also known}} as carbamylcholine, is a cholinomimetic drug that binds and {{activates}} the acetylcholine receptor.

50|$|<b>Carbachol</b> is a {{parasympathomimetic}} that stimulates both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. In topical ocular and intraocular administration {{its principal}} effects are miosis and increased aqueous humour outflow.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} found that paired-pulse {{stimulation}} (PPS) induces a form of homosynaptic LTD in the superficial layers of the visual cortex when the synapse is exposed to <b>carbachol</b> (CCh) and norepinephrine (NE).|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} of the endocannabinoid is enhanced in normal, but not in endothelium-denuded rat aorta on reacting with <b>carbachol,</b> an parasympathomimetic drug. It potently reduces blood pressure in rats and may represent an endothelium-derived hypotension factor.|$|E
50|$|Use of <b>carbachol,</b> {{as well as}} {{all other}} muscarinic {{receptor}} agonists, is contraindicated in patients with asthma, coronary insufficiency, gastroduodenal ulcers, and incontinence. The parasympathomimetic action of this drug will exacerbate the symptoms of these disorders.|$|E
50|$|ICC also express mechano-sensitive {{mechanisms}} that cause these cells {{to respond to}} stretch. Stretching GI muscles can affect the resting potentials of ICC and affect the frequency of pacemaker activity. <b>Carbachol</b> increases ICC activity through ANO1 activation.|$|E
5000|$|ANO1 is {{expressed}} in the human gastrointestinal epithelium and is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal interstitial cells of Cajal, where it {{plays an important role}} in epithelial chloride secretion mediating intestinal motility. ANO1 blockers like niflumic acid have been shown to block slow waves, which produce motility, in the human intestine. [...] ANO1-knockout mice fail to produce slow waves altogether. <b>Carbachol</b> has been shown to markedly activate the channel; in light of this, it's not surprising that secretory diarrhea is a <b>Carbachol</b> overdose symptom. Crofelemer, an antidiarrhoeal, inhibits this channel. Consequently, ANO1 activation is necessary for normal function of the ICC and its generated pacemaker activity in the smooth muscles of the intestine.|$|E
50|$|Topical ocular {{administration}} {{is used to}} decrease intraocular pressure in people with primary open-angle glaucoma.

50|$|Wu M.F. et al. {{studied the}} nucleus raphes dorsalis as it pertained to {{narcolepsy}}. This is logical, as the raphe nuclei {{have been known}} {{to play a role in}} the sleep/wake cycle. Cataplexy is the symptom of narcolepsy when full awareness of the environment is maintained, but all muscle tone is lost. This has thought to be a dissociation of what normally happens during REM sleep, when all muscle tone is lost except for the eyes. The nucleus raphes dorsalis {{have been known to}} project to the lateral hypothalamus, along with the locus coeruleus and the tuberomammillary nucleus. The neurotransmitters of these three aforementioned nuclei, which project to the lateral hypothalamus, are serotonin, norepinephrine and histamine respectively. These neurotransmitters are fully active during waking hours, partially active during non-REM sleep, and have almost ceased during REM sleep. In cats with pontine lesions, their normal atonia is not present, the raphe dorsalis is fully active, as opposed to the cessation of action under normal conditions. A muscle relaxant, known as Mephenesin, reduces to activity of the dorsal nucleus, as well as microinjections of <b>carbachol</b> (which induces atonia while awake).|$|E

40|$|In the {{endplates}} of rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm, {{application of}} the acetylcholine-like compound, <b>carbachol,</b> causes a marked increase in transmitter release, as measured electrophysiologically using miniature endplate potential frequency. Washing out of <b>carbachol</b> reverses the increase in frequency. The ability of <b>carbachol</b> to increase transmitter release is greatly enhanced by perfusion of the preparation with Ringer solution containing elevated K+. At concentrations of <b>carbachol</b> greater than 30 μM, {{the onset of the}} postjunctional blocking action of <b>carbachol</b> is too rapid and obscures the increase in miniature potential frequency. The rate of increase in transmitter release is dependent on the concentration of <b>carbachol</b> applied and can be antagonized by d-tubocurarine (10 - 60 nM) and other blocking compounds. These findings, in contrast to previous reports, indicate that cholinergic nerve endings, like adrenergic nerve endings, respond to applied acetylcholine-like drugs with measurable increases in transmitter output...|$|E

40|$|The {{degree to}} which the RhoA kinase (ROK) blockers, Y- 27632 (1 μM) and HA- 1077 (10 μM), and the PKC blocker, GF- 109203 X (1 μM), reduced force {{produced}} by <b>carbachol,</b> a muscarinic receptor agonist, and phenylephrine, an α-adrenoceptor agonist, was examined in rabbit stomach fundus smooth muscle. When examining the effect on cumulative <b>carbachol</b> concentration-response curves (CRCs), ROK and PKC blockers shifted the potency (EC 50) to the right but did not reduce the maximum response. In a single-dose <b>carbachol</b> protocol using moderate (∼EC 50) and maximum <b>carbachol</b> concentrations, Y- 27632 and HA- 1077 reduced peak force, but GF- 109203 X had no effect. By contrast, all three agents inhibited the <b>carbachol</b> contractions of rabbit bladder (detrusor) smooth muscle. Compared to <b>carbachol,</b> phenylephrine produced a weaker maximum response that was not inhibited by phentolamine, atropine nor capsaicin but was inhibited by Y- 27632, HA- 1077 and GF- 109203 X. In detrusor, classical down-regulation occurred, but in fundus, up-regulation of responsiveness occurred. This up-regulation in fundus may have been a post-receptor event, because a KCl-induced contraction produced after a <b>carbachol</b> CRC was stronger than one produced before the <b>carbachol</b> stimulus. In conclusion, these data suggest that ROK plays a critical role in the regulation of rabbit fundus smooth muscle contraction, which is distinct from chicken gizzard smooth muscle, where ROK is reported to exist but to not play a role in muscarinic receptor-induced contraction. Additional unique findings are that PKC participates in phenylephrine- but not carbachol-induced contraction in fundus, that <b>carbachol</b> does not activate identical subcellular signalling systems in fundus and detrusor, and that fundus, unlike detrusor, responds to <b>carbachol</b> stimulation with post-receptor up-regulation of contraction...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} locally {{administered}} physostigmine and di-isopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP) were compared on the secretory response of sweat glands to intradermally injected acetylcholine and <b>carbachol</b> in healthy male volunteers (physostigmine: six subjects; DFP: one subject). The response to acetylcholine {{reached its peak}} within 10 s of injection and then rapidly declined, whereas the response to <b>carbachol</b> increased steadily reaching a peak between 5 and 7 min after injection. The response to acetylcholine was potentiated {{in the presence of}} both physostigmine and DFP, whilst the response to <b>carbachol</b> was not significantly affected by either of these drugs. The difference in the time-course of responses to acetylcholine and <b>carbachol</b> may be attributed to differences in the susceptibility of the two drugs to metabolism by acetylcholinesterase; <b>carbachol,</b> unlike acetylcholine, being virtually immune to metabolism by this enzyme. It is concluded that the response to <b>carbachol</b> is mediated by a direct stimulatory action on post-synaptic muscarinic receptors rather than by activation of pre-synaptic nicotinic receptors leading to the release of endogenous acetylcholine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A key {{signaling}} pathway involved in regulating cell growth and proliferation {{throughout the body}} is the ERK {{signaling pathway}}. ERK is activated via numerous pathways including intracellular calcium release downstream of G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). <b>Carbachol,</b> a GPCR-agonist, both increases intracellular calcium and ERK activation in MCF- 7 cells. ERK activation and control of cell growth may act through the transcription factor Elk- 1. Our goal was to elucidate the specific proteins and kinases upstream of ERK in MCF- 7 cells treated with <b>carbachol.</b> Secondly, we wanted to investigate the potential involvement of Elk- 1 downstream of ERK. <b>Carbachol</b> treatment of MCF- 7 cells triggered ERK and Elk- 1 phosphorylation within 5 minutes. Interestingly, transfection of cells with shRNAs directed to either CaM KKα or CaM KIγ significantly inhibited <b>carbachol</b> activation of ERK. Phosphorylation of Elk- 1, following <b>carbachol</b> stimulation, was also blocked in siERK 2 transfected cells, suggesting that ERK 2 is required for <b>carbachol</b> 2 ̆ 7 s activation of Elk- 1. Our results suggest that <b>carbachol</b> treatment of MCF- 7 cells activates ERK and cell growth through CaM KK, CaMKI, and an Elk- 1 -dependent pathway...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMicroinjection of the {{cholinergic}} agonist <b>carbachol</b> {{into the}} bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) {{has been reported to}} cause pressor response in unanesthetized rats, which was shown to be mediated by an acute release of vasopressin into the systemic circulation and followed by baroreflex-mediated bradycardia. In the present study, we tested the possible involvement of the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei in the pressor response evoked by <b>carbachol</b> microinjection into the BST of unanesthetized rats. For this, cardiovascular responses following <b>carbachol</b> (1 nmol/ 100 nL) microinjection into the BST were studied before and after PVN or SON pretreatment, either ipsilateral or contralateral in relation to BST microinjection site, with the nonselective neurotransmission blocker cobalt chloride (CoCl 2, 1 mM/ 100 nL). <b>Carbachol</b> microinjection into the BST evoked pressor response. Moreover, BST treatment with <b>carbachol</b> significantly increased plasma vasopressin levels, thus confirming previous evidences that <b>carbachol</b> microinjection into the BST evokes pressor response due to vasopressin release into the circulation. SON pretreatment with CoCl 2, either ipsilateral or contralateral in relation to BST microinjection site, inhibited the pressor response to <b>carbachol</b> microinjection into the BST. However, CoCl 2 microinjection into the ipsilateral or contralateral PVN did not affect carbachol-evoked pressor response. In conclusion, our results suggest that pressor response to <b>carbachol</b> microinjection into the BST is mediated by SON magnocellular neurons, without significant involvement of those in the PVN. The results also indicate that responses to <b>carbachol</b> microinjection into the BST are mediated by a neural pathway that depends on the activation of both ipsilateral and contralateral SON...|$|E
