5000|$|The {{extension}} of the Victoria line to Brixton required additional trains, and a further 18 four-car units were built. These were {{identical to the original}} units, and the numbering scheme followed on from where the first batch ended. Increasing traffic levels on the Victoria line during the 1980s eventually required more trains, which posed a problem, since no other stock could operate on the line, because of the need for it to operate automatically. The 1972 Mk I Stock was similar, although it was built to run as seven-car trains, with a four-car unit much like the 1967 stock, and a three-car unit consisting of a driving motor car, a trailer car, and an uncoupling non-driving motor car, which was a motor car with no cab for the driver. Instead it was fitted with a shunting <b>control</b> <b>cabinet</b> at the outer end. The main differences between the 1972 and the 1967 stock was that the latter was designed for two-man operation, having door controls for the guard at the trailing end of the driving motor cars, and that it was reversible, as it had been ordered for the Northern line, where the Kennington Loop can result in either end of the train facing {{the north end of the}} line.|$|E
50|$|Because Hardan {{recognized}} what Saddam Hussein’s intentions had been, {{he started}} {{to set up a}} strategy of his own. In 1969 Hardan tried to show his power and authority by convincing Bakr to send Saddam into exile for having questioned his power and motives in front of the council. Saddam was sent away on a plane just as several other exiled Iraqis in the past had been but he was to return just one week later with vengeance in his heart. After having returned to Iraq, Saddam set out to destroy Hardan right away. First he had his Deputy Premier Position taken away by merging the title into the president’s position. Saddam did this by simply convincing Bakr that Hardan was after his presidential seat. Listening to what Saddam suggested, Bakr started to implement a plan that would strip Hardan of actual controlling power. Hardan al-Tikriti was soon given the position as Vice President but this meant nothing because he no longer had the power to <b>control</b> <b>cabinet</b> meetings. Finally on 15 October 1970 Hardan was dismissed from all positions he carried because he was accused of disregarding efforts of the Ba'thist Party to help the Arabs. These posts included the Minister of Defence and Deputy Premier of Iraq. He was also dismissed from the Revolutionary Command Council. The charge against him meant that he wasn’t helping the Ba’th live up to their oath to help protect the Palestinians. Hardan was later sent into exile and like all others he was put on a plane and flown out of the state. He was sent to Madrid initially. He returned weeks later to Iraq to try to clear his record. However, he was unsuccessful and was turned around right away and sent to Algeria to be the Iraqi Ambassador. He wasn’t accepted there so he later left. After a period of exile in London, Hardan was appointed as Iraqi Ambassador to Sweden. However, Hardan disliked being away from the Iraqi political scene and he travelled to Kuwait from where he attempted to organize a coup against Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein. On 30 March 1971, Hardan was assassinated on the orders of Saddam Hussein in Kuwait.|$|E

The solution consists of a <b>control</b> <b>cabinet,</b> which houses the physical elements required for controlling the furnace, a program which controls the heating process and a user interface for interaction. The thesis primarily focuses {{on the field of}} control theory, as it uses a PID controller, a common controller in the field of automation. For the purpose of determining the correct parameters of the controller I used the Ziegler-Nichols method on a model of the furnace. The <b>control</b> <b>cabinet</b> includes fuses, soft starters and similiar elements to allow the furnace and it's actuators to function safely and to protect them from unintended use. The control program runs on a Siemens programmable logic controller. It is written in Step 7 using ladder diagrams, and uses sensors to protect the furnace and it's environment, allows users to dynamically change the heating program and communicates with the PID controller. The user interface is robust and easy to use.

The Power distribution analysis of the <b>controlling</b> <b>cabinet</b> is presented together with the component in power cabinet.
