40|$|Abstract: The fitting of {{security}} devices to motor vehicles {{has become an}} important approach to the prevention of motor vehicle crime. In cars, manu-facturers have focused primarily on improving perimeter security to prevent breaking-in to the vehicle, and installing devices to prevent parked vehicles from being unlawfully driven away. The steering <b>column</b> <b>lock</b> Is an Important example of this approach, being {{the outcome of the}} first and only regulations requiring vehicles to befitted with anti-theft devices. The Federal Republic of Germany was the first country to Introduce such regulations, In 1961, followed nearly ten years later by the U. S. and Britain. This paper examines the effect of these regulations on motor vehicle crime In each of these countries. The evidence from all three countries is that steering column locks have helped to bring vehicle theft, particularly theftfor temporary use, under control for lengthy periods. The paper provides evidence that the speed with which the vehicle population has been protected by steering column locks, and the availability of other types of vehicles notprotected by such anti-theft devices, are Important issues in explaining theft patterns...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether one can achieve stable fixation of a two column (transverse) acetabular fracture by only fixing a single <b>column</b> with a <b>locking</b> plate and unicortical locking screws. We hypothesized that a locking plate applied to the anterior column of a transverse acetabular fracture would create a construct that is more rigid than a non-locking plate, and that this construct would be biomechanically comparable to two column fixation. Methods Using urethane foam models of the pelvis, we simulated transverse acetabular fractures and stabilized them with 1) an anterior column plate with bicortical screws, 2) an anterior locking plate with unicortical screws, 3) an anterior plate and posterior column lag screw, and 4) a posterior plate with an anterior column lag screw. These constructs were mechanically loaded on a servohydraulic material testing machine. Construct stiffness and fracture displacement were measured. Result and Discussion We found that two column fixation is 54 % stiffer than a single column fixation with a conventional plate with bicortical screws. There was no significant difference between fixation with an anterior <b>column</b> <b>locking</b> plate with unicortical screws and an anterior plate with posterior column lag screw. We detected a non-significant trend towards more stiffness for the anterior locking plate compared to the anterior non-locking plate. Conclusion In conclusion, a locking plate construct of the anterior column provides less stability than a traditional both column construct with posterior plate and anterior column lag screw. However, the locking construct offers greater strength than a non-locking, bicortical construct, which in addition often requires extensive contouring and its application is oftentimes accompanied by the risk of neurovascular damage. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Extraarticular {{fractures}} of distal humerus {{are challenging}} injuries to treat because of complex anatomy and fracture patterns. Functional bracing may not provide adequate stability in these injuries and operative treatment with intramedullary nails or conventional plates {{also has the}} limitation of inadequate fixation in the short distal fragment. The 3. 5 mm precontoured single <b>column</b> <b>locking</b> plate (extraarticular distal humerus plate [EADHP]) has been introduced to overcome this problem. We evaluated the clinical and functional outcomes of treating these fractures with the EADHP. Materials and Methods: 26 patients with extraarticular fractures of distal humerus presenting within 3 weeks of injury between January 2012 and June 2015, were included in this prospective study. Open IIIB and IIIC fractures, nonunions, or those {{with a history of}} previous infection in the arm were excluded. Operative fixation was done using the EADHP in all the cases. The time for union, range of motion at shoulder and elbow and secondary procedures were recorded in followup. The shoulder and elbow function was assessed using the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder scale and Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) respectively. Results: There were 21 males and 5 females with mean age of 37. 3 years (range 18 - 72 years). Twenty two (84. 6 %) cases had complex fracture patterns (AO/OTA Type 12 -B and C). The mean time to fracture union was 22. 4 weeks (range 16 - 28 weeks). The mean followup time was 11. 6 months, (range 4 - 24 months). Four patients (15. 4 %) had failure of cortical screws in the proximal fracture fragment, of which two required revision fixation with bone grafting. Another nonunion was seen following a surgical site infection, which healed after wound lavage and bone grafting. The MEPS (average: 96. 1; range 80 - 100) was excellent in 81 % cases (n = 21) and good in 19 % cases (n = 5). UCLA score (average: 33. 5; range 25 - 35) was good/excellent in 88. 5 % cases (n = 23) and fair in 11. 5 % cases (n = 3). Conclusion: EADHP is a reliable option in treating extraarticular distal humeral fractures as it provides stable fixation with an early return to function...|$|R
30|$|Wei et al. [33] {{randomized}} 46 {{patients with}} an unstable distal radius fracture {{to be treated}} with augmented external fixation (n =  22), a volar locking plate (n =  12) or a radial <b>locking</b> <b>column</b> plate (n =  12). Fractures were considered unstable if fracture fragments were redisplaced following closed reduction and cast immobilization, or if three of the following criteria were met: dorsal angulation of > 20 °, dorsal comminution, an intra-articular fracture, an associated ulnar styloid fracture or age > 60  years. Patients were randomized into three study arms in two phases. First, patients were assigned {{to be treated with}} augmented external or internal fixation. During a second randomization, the patients who had been assigned to receive internal fixation were further randomized to be treated with either a volar locking (EBI OptiLock, Parsippany, New Jersey) or a radial <b>locking</b> <b>column</b> plate. Randomization was done by computer-generated allocation using sealed, opaque envelopes. Only data on patients treated with an external fixator or with a volar locking plate were included in this meta-analysis. Treatment with external fixation (Hoffmann II Compact, Stryker) was augmented with K-wires in all patients, additional small buttress plates (n =  2) or filling of the metaphyseal void with cancellous bone allograft (n =  4) as deemed appropriate by the surgeon. Two patients who had originally been assigned to be treated with a volar locking plate received additional fixation with a dorsal plate, and four patients received supplemental bone grafting following fixation with a volar locking plate. These patients were included in the analysis in the group they were originally assigned to. DASH scores were reported at a follow-up of 3, 6 and 12  months.|$|R

40|$|The alpha- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) {{are being}} {{scavenged}} {{from the atmosphere}} by falling snow, with the average total scavenging ratios (WT) of 3. 8 x 10 ** 4 and 9. 6 x 10 ** 3, respectively. After deposition, HCH snow concentrations can decrease by 40 % because of snowpack ventilation and increase by 50 % because of upward migration of brine from the ice. HCH vertical distribution in sufficiently cold winter sea ice, which maintains brine volume fractions < 5 %, reflects the ice growth history. Initially, the entrapment of brine (and HCHs) in ice depends on the rates of ice growth and desalination. However, after approximately {{the first week of}} ice formation, ice growth rate becomes dominant. Deviations of HCH concentrations from the values predicted by the ice bulk salinity (rate of brine entrapment) can be explained by spatial variability of HCHs in surface water. HCH burden in the majority of the ice <b>column</b> remains <b>locked</b> throughout most of the season until the early spring when snow meltwater percolates into the ice, delivering HCHs to the upper ocean via desalination by flushing. Percolation can lead to an increase in alpha- and gamma-HCH in the sea ice by up to 2 %- 18 % and 4 %- 32 %, respectively...|$|R

5000|$|The processor's {{heatsink}} is permanently attached, and the removable fan module {{is powered}} via spring-like metal prongs that connect to {{a trio of}} conductors {{on the surface of}} the chip.

The central plastic [...] "column" [...] that leads from the center of the fan houses the fan wiring and leads down the side of the heatsink at this corner. The small plastic points at each top left of this <b>column</b> are the <b>locking</b> mechanism for the fan and are released by squeezing them. The opposite corner of the CPU has a latch that locks the fan around underneath the heatsink, by swinging into place upon assembly.

40|$|Oceanic {{stratification}} {{represents an}} effective mechanism to reduce vertical mixing {{of the water}} <b>column,</b> thereby <b>locking</b> up carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the deep sea and preventing air–sea exchange of CO 2. It has been proposed that enhanced stratification of the upper water column in polar oceans during late Cenozoic cooling episodes limited the upwelling of CO 2 -rich deep waters and thus CO 2 -release to the atmosphere, resulting in a net global drawdown of atmospheric CO 2. Increased stratification in the Subarctic Northwest Pacific, during both the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation at 2. 73 Ma and late Quaternary glacial periods, has been recently linked to enhanced ocean stratification south of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) in the Pacific and Atlantic sectors of the Southern Ocean. Increased stratification of Southern Ocean surface waters was mainly deduced from a reduction of biological production during these cooling episodes, manifested by the decrease of geochemical proxies for productivity, such as biogenic opal and barium, in the marine sediment records. However, the records chosen from the Southern Ocean do not provide evidence for a more stratified upper water column, rather the observed decrease in biological productivity {{is likely to have}} resulted from an expansion of annual sea-ice coverage. The sediment records suggest that south of the APF in the Pacific and Atlantic sectors of the Southern Ocean, extensive sea ice {{may have contributed to the}} global CO 2 -drawdown during glacial periods, with hypothetical glacial increase of stratification in today's permanent open-ocean zone merely being an “add on“ caused by this expansion...|$|R

In the rear, the Dart’s new rectangular tail lights were set into a wedge-shaped rear bumper design continuing the angled trailing edge of the new deck lid and quarter panels. The revised rear styling did not change the 14.1 cubic ft trunk space of the 1969 model. 14-inch wheels became standard equipment, and the 170 cuin L slant-6 {{was replaced by a}} larger 198 cuin L version for improved base-model performance and greater manufacturing economy—the 198 used the same block as the 225, while the 170 had used a different block.
