40|$|Good evening. It {{is indeed}} a great {{privilege}} to be here this evening {{as one of the}} speakers in the Catherine Bauer Wurster Lecture Series. I am here in the interests of ideological balance. Or, to put it more sim­ ply, I'm the bad guy. It has fallen to me to be the defender of the hated Reagan-Bush do-nothing policies which, according to Peter Dreier, drove American housing markets into the ground. To be called upon to defend the market at Berkeley is about as comfortable a position as de­ fending socialism before the U. S. Cha'Tiber of Commerce.

Barkley contributed 5 passing touchdowns (3 to wide {{receiver}} Ronald Johnson) on 17-of-23 passing for 257 yards.

Barkley said, [...] "I'm {{just trying to be}} as perfect as I can be. Last week was pretty close, but that perfect game is kind of a goal and that's no completions."

60|$|April 9. Victory! I {{have done}} splendidly! At seven o'clock last night I took a hasty dinner, and then locked myself {{up in my}} bedroom and dropped the key into the garden. I chose a cheery novel, and lay in bed for three hours trying to read it, but really in a horrible state of trepidation, expecting every instant that I should become {{conscious}} of the impulse. Nothing of the sort occurred, however, and I awoke {{this morning with the}} feeling that a black nightmare had been lifted off me.

5000|$|However, {{when it came}} to [...] "Bada Natkhat hai Re Krishna Kanhaiyya", things took a {{different}} turn when his father, veteran music director, S. D. Burman intervened and asked Burman to redo the tune. Burman was given the brief of [...] "usual bhajan situation" [...] by Samanta, later as he was giving final touches to the tune, his father heard the tune, and asked for the precise description of situation. On listening to the situation, he expressed his dismay as not doing justice to the situation, as R.D. Burman recounted in a later interview, [...] "But where's the composer in you in this tune, Pancham (Burman's nickname)?" [...] and went on to explain, [...] "..For Sharmila here is something more than the nautch-girl she plays. Her motherly instincts have been aroused by that kid. Your tune therefore must communicate all the agony of the nautch-girl wanting to be the mother she <b>can</b> never be. <b>Do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> your way, but with the moving human situation in mind." [...] Thus R.D. Burman made a tune in Raga Khamaj, which Lata Mangeshkar too sang with marked emotional clarity and abandon, who is usually prone let her technical dexterity outshine. The song became a classic, and later Burman called it, [...] "his best lesson in music" [...] from his father.|$|R
60|$|MRS. ALLONBY. He should {{persistently}} compromise us in public, {{and treat}} us with absolute respect {{when we are}} alone. And yet he should be always ready to have a perfectly terrible scene, whenever we want one, and to become miserable, absolutely miserable, at a moment's notice, and to overwhelm us with just reproaches in less than twenty minutes, and to be positively violent {{at the end of}} half an hour, and to leave us for ever at a quarter to eight, when we have to go and dress for dinner. And when, after that, one has seen him for really the last time, and he has refused to take back the little things he has given one, and promised never to communicate with one again, or to write one any foolish letters, he should be perfectly broken-hearted, and telegraph to one all day long, and send one little notes every half-hour by a private hansom, and dine quite alone at the club, so that every one should know how unhappy he was. And after a whole dreadful week, during which one has gone about everywhere with one's husband, just to show how absolutely lonely one was, he may be given a third last parting, in the evening, and then, if his conduct has been quite irreproachable, and one has behaved really badly to him, he should be allowed to admit that he has been entirely in the wrong, and when he has admitted that, it becomes a woman's duty to forgive, and one <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all over <b>again</b> from the beginning, with variations.|$|R

60|$|Courage and cowardice are not two {{distinct}} and entirely antagonistic qualities. To {{a great extent}} those qualities {{are the result of}} training. Every courageous man has a slight amount of cowardice in his composition, and all cowards have a certain infusion of courage. The matador stands before the infuriated bull, and awaits its charge with unflinching firmness, not because he has more courage than his comrades in the ring who run away, but because long training has enabled him to make almost certain of killing the bull.

Koo Ting-sang shocked by Hsia Sa words says he is conceited about his style and also remarks that while Hsia Sa snake style is great his monkey style can kill snakes and engages him in a lengthy fight and defeats and badly injures Hsia Sa.

50|$|In an April 2009 Newsweek interview, Iacocca {{reflected}} on his time spent at Chrysler and the company's current situation. He said: This {{is a sad}} day for me. It pains me to see my old company, which has meant so much to America, on the ropes. But Chrysler has been in trouble before, and we got through it, and I believe they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> If they're smart, they'll bring together a consortium of workers, plant managers and dealers to come up with real solutions. These are the folks on the front lines, and they're the key to survival. Let's face it, if your car breaks down, you're {{not going to take it}} to the White House to get fixed. But, if your company breaks down, you've got to go to the experts on the ground, not the bureaucrats. Every day I talk to dealers and managers, who are passionate and full of ideas. No one wants Chrysler to survive more than they do. So I'd say to the Obama administration, don't leave them out. Put their passion and ideas to work. Because of the Chrysler bankruptcy, Iacocca may lose part of his pension from a supplemental executive retirement plan, and a guaranteed company car during his lifetime. The losses were due to take place once the bankruptcy court approves the sale of Chrysler to Chrysler Group LLC, with ownership of the new company by the United Auto Workers, the Italian carmaker Fiat and the governments of the United States and Canada.|$|E
40|$|What kind {{of peace}} do we seek? Not a Pax Americana {{enforced}} {{on the world}} by American weapons of war. Not {{the peace of the}} grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, the kind that enables men and nations to grow and to hope and to build a better life for their children- not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women- not merely peace in our time but peace for all time [...] Let us examine our attitude toward peace itself. Too many of us think it is impossible. Too many think it unreal. But that is a dangerous, defeatist belief. It leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable-that mankind is doomed- that we are gripped by forces we cannot control. We need not accept that view. Our problems are manmade- therefore, they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants. No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings.

40|$|Joint Applied ProjectThe {{purpose of}} this Joint Applied Project is to develop and field a Contracting Officer/Team Leader Handbook. Multiple factors have led to an {{environment}} that is less than optimal for the accomplishment of the acquisition mission. There has been a significant loss of corporate knowledge in the Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (CE LCMC) workforce combined with acceleration in promotions to the GS- 13 level. The experience level of current Contracting Officers is limited due to rapid promotions. In the past few years the organizational culture focused more on cycle time reductions, versus the quality of the work product in order to satisfy the needs of the customer. In addition, since the supervisory role was raised to the GS- 14 level, and GS- 13 's were relieved of supervisory responsibility, there has been increased confusion as {{to the role of the}} team leader. Initial research suggests that Contracting Officers/Team Leaders need another resource to support them in the accomplishment of their varied duties. The C-E LCMC Acquisition Center's strategic plan for the next 12 -month period sets forth a vision of a new business culture - one that defines competency at three different levels. The first level is "Do" a complex task (being able to repeat this task consistently), followed by level two, which is "Understand Why" (being able to take learned knowledge and apply that to solving the next problem and doing the next task; being able to improve execution each time and refine), and ending with level three "Explain the Why" (mastering knowledge and skill so that one <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> and show someone how to do it and why), which leads others to competency. The plan is to enhance the workforce skill sets, ensure contracting is done right, and focus on leadership development. The objective of this project is to align with this plan and provide a guide that supports Contracting Officers/Team Leaders in three key areas: technical competence, leadership, and customer relations.
