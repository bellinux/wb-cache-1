40|$|Abstract: This study {{examines}} the crafting of an information security policy {{as a process}} of legitimising. Drawing on organisational research on legitimacy and legitimisation and on 15 -month ethnographic study of a multinational corporation that sought to craft a new policy, the study identifies four legitimising strategies employed during policy crafting: (1) inviting participation, (2) embedding into existing practices, (3) advertising and (4) formalising and professionalising. The study conceptualises policy crafting as being constituted through iterative and recursive relationship of legitimising strategies and policy amendments. The study <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>literature</b> on information security management, on information security policies and on legitimacy...|$|E

We demonstrate that once port is selected the port size and the administered incentive level positively influences the level of port user's production; that the port's marginal cost incentive rate can change the firm's location given the relative size of the ports; {{the changes in the}} incentive level set at one port should be more than the inversed relative port size to the other port...|$|E

The authors conceptualize and empirically investigate the role of donor-funded CSR initiatives aimed at promoting collective action by cluster-based {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). A case study of the Sialkot football-manufacturing cluster in Pakistan indicates that donor-funded support of CSR initiatives in industrial clusters in developing countries may be short-lived, due to the political economy of aid, the national context of CSR implementation, tensions within SME networks, and negative perceptions of CSR by the cluster-based SMEs themselves. The findings and implications of this analysis can inform both research and policy making in this area...|$|E
