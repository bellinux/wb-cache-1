Unlike bequests to children which can be taxed at a maximum statutory rate of 0. 55, such transfers are exempt from estate taxation.

50|$|The Codrington Plantations {{were two}} {{historic}} sugarcane producing estates {{on the island}} of Barbados, established in the 17th Century by Christopher Codrington (died 1698) and his father of the same name.

The history of the plantations illustrates both the 18th century Church of England's dependence on financial support for Christian mission work in the West Indies from local landowners, and, until the growth of the Abolitionism, an institutional unwillingness to address issues relating to slavery.|$|E

5000|$|Since the Middle Ages, the Christian {{understanding}} of slavery has seen significant internal conflict and endured dramatic change. One notable example where church mission {{activities in the}} Caribbean were directly supported by the proceeds of slave ownership was {{under the terms of}} a <b>charitable</b> <b>bequest</b> in 1710 to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. The Codrington Plantations in Barbados, were granted to the Society to fund the establishment of Codrington College. In the first decade of ownership, several hundred slaves at the plantation estates were branded on their chests, using the traditional red hot iron, with the word Society, to signify their ownership by the Christian organisation. Slave ownership at the Codrington Plantations only finally came to an end in 1833, when slavery in British Empire was abolished.

5000|$|Gomez {{stated that}} Bowers' Last Will and Testament {{intended}} that {{the cars were}} to be gifted to Christians as a <b>charitable</b> <b>bequest.</b> The Christian beneficiary only had to pay a [...] "conveyance fee" [...] of roughly $1,000 to $1,100, each vehicle's estimated title transfer and tax liability. Once the estate cleared probate, the vehicles would be conveyed to their new owners. Gomez prepared the groundwork for his scam by stating that the key details {{that could be used}} in the verification of this bequest (the vehicle VIN numbers and/or their State's Title serial numbers, which were the definitive evidence of each vehicles’ actual existence) were under seal, not to be publicly disclosed by the probate court until the estate's final disposition, objections disposed of (if any) and a final probate of the [...] "Bowers Estate" [...] had been entered as both ruling and Order by the Court. Until that time, it was plausible that the actual details of the dimensions of an [...] "estate", and the proposed disposition of its contents, could be withheld from general release and/or publication by a gag order imposed by the probate judge. Therefore, Gomez suggested, that to speed the process of “God’s” cars going to “God’s” people, the intended recipients should pay their “transfer fees” in advance, up front, and then simply await the delivery of their cars.|$|E

40|$|Much {{is known}} about motivations for giving to {{charities}} generally. However, much less has been identified about bequestors as a unique type of charitable donor. This paper explores the motives and barriers for <b>charitable</b> <b>bequest</b> giving. Hypotheses are drawn from the general philanthropic literature and tested using survey data from Australia, a nation distinguished by very high lifetime (inter vivos) giving but low estate (post mortem) giving. The results show that belief in the efficacy of charitable organizations is requisite for leaving a bequest, as the deceased donor has no control over {{the enactment of the}} gift. This effect is mediated by the perceived difficulty of making a <b>charitable</b> <b>bequest,</b> which forms an important barrier for leaving such a legacy. Having family whose financial needs are perceived as not taken care of and the perception of financial inability to make a difference also form barriers for bequest giving. The results confirm that bequests constitute a distinctive charitable behaviour, with unique motives and barriers compared to other types of inter vivos giving. While charitable behaviour in general is driven by altruistic attitudes and political and religious values, as well as social reputation, these factors do not affect <b>charitable</b> <b>bequest</b> making as expected. Surprisingly, we find a negative relationship between financial resources and the inclination to leave a <b>charitable</b> <b>bequest.</b> The article ends with suggestions for ways charities might connect more meaningfully with their bequestors or with donors who might consider bequeathing to them...|$|E
