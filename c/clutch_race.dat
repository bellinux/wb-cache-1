50|$|Clutches {{in typical}} cars are mounted {{directly}} to {{the face of the}} engine's flywheel, as this already provides a convenient large diameter steel disk that can act as one driving plate of the <b>clutch.</b> Some <b>racing</b> <b>clutches</b> use small multi-plate disk packs that {{are not part of the}} flywheel. Both clutch and flywheel are enclosed in a conical bellhousing, which (in a rear-wheel drive car) usually forms the main mounting for the gearbox.|$|R

500|$|In October 1904, Smith {{traveled}} to the Winyah Sanitarium in Asheville, North Carolina for treatment of his worsening cough, a result of advanced tuberculosis. George E. Smith died at the sanitarium on February 1, 1905. His death was attributed to [...] "shattering of his nerves", instead of tuberculosis, due to his habit of never showing emotion. Smith was interred in Union Dale Cemetery in Pittsburgh, {{a short distance from}} his childhood home in Allegheny. His funeral occurred on February 5 during a snowstorm and was attended by many people. He was entombed in a stone mausoleum that reportedly cost $30,000 to build and was built to Smith's specifications seven years before his death. His mother later commissioned a statue in his likeness and placed it on top of the mausoleum.

40|$|The {{torque output}} of a carbon/carbon multi-plate Formula One <b>clutch</b> during <b>race</b> starts {{has proved to}} be both {{unstable}} and inconsistent. A specially designed single clutch-plate interface dynamometer (SCID) showed the formation of narrow (~ 2 mm), high-temperature (1300 - 1650 °C) hot bands during tests replicating race start conditions, suggesting that less than 15 % of the full friction surface areas were in contact. A thermomechanically coupled finite element analysis (TCFEA) was developed to simulate the thermomechanical behaviour of the clutch plates during SCID testing. With allowance for wear, the TCFEA closely replicated the SCID results. Both the SCID and TCFEA demonstrated no radial movement of the hot bands during single engagements indicating that torque instability is due to surface morphology effects alone. The hot band migration observed between successive SCID engagements indicated that torque inconsistency is due to both surface morphology and hot band migration effects...|$|R

50|$|The Wilson gearbox was {{produced}} {{with a variety}} of clutches. The best-known is the fluid flywheel, used for touring cars such as the Daimler and the Armstrong-Siddeley. Sports cars used a Newton centrifugal clutch. This was a multiple plate dry <b>clutch,</b> similar to <b>racing</b> manual <b>clutches</b> of the time, but with the pressure plate centrifugally actuated to engage at around 600rpm. Pure racing cars, such as the ERA, avoided a clutch altogether and relied on the progressive engagement of the gearbox's band brake on lowest gear when starting.|$|R

Sunbeam III race no.7 (its 1921 G.P. race no 10 still grinning under the new livery for Jean Chassagne (riding mechanic Robert Laly) proceeded to win the race in 5hr 24min 50sec averaging 55.78 mph.|$|R
40|$|The {{torque output}} of a carbon/carbon multi-plate Formula One <b>clutch</b> during <b>race</b> starts {{has proved to}} be both {{unstable}} and inconsistent. A one-dimensional heat transfer model utilising a Taguchi analysis suggested that a close interdependency exists between surface temperature, surface morphology and coefficient of friction thus affecting torque output stability. Friction surface examination showed that a non-uniform friction surface height may lead to thermoelastic instabilities and effective friction radius migration which directly affects torque output. A single clutch-plate interface dynamometer confirmed the formation of narrow (~ 2 mm), high-temperature (1300 - 1650 °C) hot bands during tests replicating race start conditions, indicating the establishment of thermoelastic instabilities. The hot bands did not move radially during single engagements but did migrate between successive engagements indicating that torque instability during single engagements is due to surface morphology effects alone whilst torque inconsistency between engagements is due to both surface morphology and effective friction radius migration effects...|$|R
50|$|THM400 {{transmissions}} {{are very}} popular in automotive competition due to their great strength. Much of this strength comes {{from the use of}} a cast iron center support to suspend the transmission's concentric shafts that join the clutch assemblies to the gear train. The center support, which is splined to the interior of the transmission's case, also provides a robust reaction point for first gear (the gear train's reaction carrier is restrained from counter-rotating the engine in first gear by a roller <b>clutch</b> whose inner <b>race</b> is part of the center support). Since the first gear reactive force is evenly distributed around the periphery of the case, the types of mechanical (and some times violent) failures that have plagued other competition transmissions are rare.|$|R

50|$|For {{the celebrated}} long-distance race at Sebring, Florida, in March 1959, the BMC Competition Department entered three Austin-Healey Sprites in the 12 Hours Grand Prix d'Endurance. The cars were {{prepared}} by Donald's son Geoffrey Healey at the company's Cape Works in Warwick, and were {{fitted with a}} prototype Dunlop disc brake on all four wheels as well as wire wheels (and tyres) from the same company. Larger twin 1-inch SU carburettors gave the engines more performance and special twin-plate <b>racing</b> <b>clutches</b> took the drive to straight-cut close-ratio gearboxes. The cars were raced by Hugh Sutherland, Phil Stiles, Ed Leavens, Dr Harold Kunz, Fred Hayes, John Christy and John Colgate Jnr. Despite setbacks, the Sprites managed to finish first, second and third in their class, and their success in this premier sportscar race, {{which was part of}} FIA World Sportscar Championship, gave valuable publicity to BMC in the important North American market.|$|R
50|$|Jessica {{attempts}} to trade herself for Natalie, but Ford intervenes and a chandelier falls {{on top of}} him. John tried to fend off Mitch, but after Mitch nearly kills John, Natalie shoots him fatally and Mitch is killed at long last. Allison Perkins then confronts Viki and Clint at Llanfair where she reveals she orchestrated the entire breakout {{and is no longer}} under Mitch's spell. She reveals that Jessica is actually Clint's daughter and that she lied to Mitch all those years ago and altered the DNA test done back in 2001. However, she still shoots Viki in cold blood and as Clint tries to call 911, he suffers another heart attack. While Viki awakens in heaven, Clint awakens in hell. Cole too awakens in heaven and is greeted by Luna Moody, who encourages him to fight for his life. While the doctors give up on Cole, Starr declares she still loves him, which causes James to end their romance (even though James believes Cole to be dead). Ford awakens in hell and despite his changed ways and pleas to live, he dies of his injuries. Viki is greeted by her daughter Megan and Clint is greeted by Stacy Morasco whose heart he now has. While Stacy condemns Clint to hell, and Megan encourages her mother to rest and cross over into heaven, Clint escapes Stacy's <b>clutches</b> and <b>races</b> to find Viki where he declares his undying love. The two choose to give life another chance and are revived by paramedics.|$|R
2500|$|Gutiérrez {{was handed}} a twenty-second time penalty after the {{stewards}} judged {{him to have}} been responsible for the collision between himself and Grosjean which punctured the Sauber's right-rear tyre although they accepted the view he had brake problems. Gutiêrrez stated his brake problems had appeared in [...] "an inconsistency that sometimes you cannot predict" [...] and that he did not move lines purposefully and the contact with Grosjean was [...] "an unfortunate moment." [...] Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn deemed the incident [...] "unnecessary" [...] and Grosjean said he was not sure as to what happened with Gutiérrez. Concerning Bottas's poor start that dropped him down the field, Williams performance chief Rob Smedley announced the team were investigating the problem and revealed they originally believed it was an issue relating to the clutch. Bottas stated he felt he was too assertive with his <b>clutch</b> and his <b>race</b> was hindered when he was unable to accelerate with the normal amount of speed leaving the chicane: [...] "The start on the formation lap – when we always do the final checks – was a bit compromised because Lewis had a slow getaway, so that maybe hurt a little bit. But definitely the tyres were not in the optimum window." ...|$|R
40|$|To {{transmit}} the drive, {{in form of}} rotation, produced during the combustion process in the cylinders to the gearbox, where it is transformed into different ratios, a coupling element is needed. This is {{the task of the}} clutch. The clutch is the part that enables a gear change. A disconnection between constantly-spinning crankshaft and the gearbox must be realized to be able to stand still as well as to change gears. Among many principles in design, the classical friction plate clutch has established it ` position in vehicle design. Especially, race car rules predict the use of conventional multi plate clutches (in some cases single plate clutches are also used) which transmit engine torque into the gearbox via friction. A traditional multi plate clutch is composed of three basic elements: the flywheel, the pressure plate and the <b>clutch</b> plates (in <b>race</b> car practice, 4 plates are the limit). The flywheel is attached {{to the end of the}} main crankshaft and the clutch plates are attached to the gearbox input shaft using a spline. When a axial load is applied to the assembly, the friction produced between plates prevents any rotation between them and a solid drive is established without any additional mechanical engagement. While a breakthrough was made with the new generation clutches in the 1980 `s, made with Carbon as friction material, the current situation in this field of the transmission is saturated. All inventions lead to some improvements in the general design field, where the main improvement happens in the whole concept of the transmission (DSG or CVT) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Coevolution between {{pairs of}} {{different}} kind of entities, such as providers and users of information, involves reciprocal selection pressures between them {{as a consequence of}} their ecological interaction. Pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) have been shown to derive fitness benefits (larger clutches) when nesting in proximity to great tits (Parus major), presumably because they this way discover and obtain information about nesting sites. Tits suffer from the resulting association (smaller <b>clutches).</b> An arms <b>race</b> between the tits (information host) and the flycatchers (information parasite) could thus result. Great tits often cover eggs with nesting material before, but not during incubation. We hypothesized that one function of egg-covering could be a counter-adaptation to reduce information parasitism by pied flycatchers. We predicted that tits should bring more new hair to cover their exposed eggs when a pied flycatcher is present near to tit nest than when a neutral (non-competing) species is present. We conducted decoy and playback experiment in Oulu and Turku, Finland. First, we removed and collected all the hair covering the tit eggs. Then, we measured how the perceived presence of flycatcher or waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus) affects tits' egg-covering by collecting and weighing the hair brought on the eggs and photographing the nest 24 h after the playback. Results: Tits brought more hair into the nest and covered the eggs more carefully after flycatcher treatment, compared to waxwing treatment. We also found that the tits in Oulu (over 600 km to north from Turku) had more hair on the top of their eggs in general. Conclusions: Together, these results suggest that the counter-adaptation function of egg-covering against information parasites may be an extension of original function to protect eggs from low temperatures...|$|R
