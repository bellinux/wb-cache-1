40|$|The {{accurate}} {{control of}} springback {{in the cold}} forming <b>of</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> integrated circuit leadframes becomes highly essential for the semi-conductor industry {{in order to be}} able to meet stringent requirements for very high lead count packages. However, most of the studies on the problems of the springback of sheet metals are based on wide strips. In the present study, a special cantilever-type forming jig has been designed to investigate the springback <b>of</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> steel and copper alloy at various die radii, die angles and die gaps. This forming jig is equipped with an advanced on-line automated imaging system to measure the springback angle of the strips. The springback was found to increase with increase of the die radius, the die angle and the die gap. Significant anisotropy in the sheet materials led to different springback behaviours for different sheet orientations. The findings of this paper can be used as a guideline for designers in the design of tools for the roller forming of integrated circuit leadframes.

40|$|The {{object of}} the {{investigation}} is the process <b>of</b> making <b>narrow</b> <b>strips</b> in a hyperbolic skew-roll mill with use of hot rolling. The dependences of broadening at sheet skew-roll rolling on the sizes of the sheet-slab, {{the value of the}} reduction, the direction of roughness, and the roll turn angle have been established. The power-force characteristics of skew-roll rolling have been determined. The optimum conditions of skew-roll hot rolling have been defined, which permits to obtain stirps measuring (2, 2 - 2, 8) x(80 - 82) mm, from brass L 63. Engineering formula for calculating the broadening at skew-roll rolling have been obtained. The process <b>of</b> producing a <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> from non-ferrous metals has been introduced. The appropriate regulations have been drawn up, and an experimental batch <b>of</b> the <b>narrow</b> <b>strips</b> has been producedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

It follows that certain uncountable collections of continua with positive span are not planar. In particular, it follows that there exists a non-planar atriodic tree-like continuum. Also, it is proved that if X is a homogeneous plane continuum then every proper subcontinuum of X has span zero. Moreover, if X is a homogeneous non-separating plane continuum, then the span of X is zero. 1. Introduction. B...|$|R

50|$|Some {{electrically}} conducting {{organic materials}} {{may have a}} higher figure of merit than existing inorganic materials. Seebeck coefficient can be even millivolts per Kelvin but electrical conductivity is usually low, resulting in small ZT values. Quasi-one-dimensional organic crystals are formed from linear chains or stacks of molecules that are packed into a 3D crystal. Under certain conditions some Q1D organic crystals may have ZT~20 {{at room temperature for}} both p- and n-type materials. This has been credited to an unspecified interference between two main electron-phonon interactions leading to the formation <b>of</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> states in the conduction band with a significantly reduced scattering rate as the mechanism compensate each other, yielding high ZT.|$|R

40|$|Summary: The human indusium griseum (IG), the paired dorsal {{continuation}} of the hippocampus, was investigated with high-field (3. 0 T) MR imaging. The IG was clearly visible in 16 out of 20 healthy volunteers. The most common pattern was a single lateralized strip. The classical neuroanatomic pattern of paired symmetric strips along the midline was found in one case. The study clearly demonstrates that diminutive, hitherto overlooked structures such as the IG now can be readily investigated in vivo by noninvasive high-field MR imaging. The indusium griseum (IG), a dorsal extension of the hippocampus, forms a symmetric pair <b>of</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> gray matter running caudal-rostrally along the dorsal aspect of the corpus callosum in the subcingulate region (1 – 5).
