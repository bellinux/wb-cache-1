It is promising for balancing the large-scale penetration of intermittent and dispersed sources of power, such as {{wind and solar}} power, into electric grids. The existing CAES plants utilize natural gas (NG) as fuel. However, China is rich in coal but is deficient in NG; therefore, a hybrid-fuel CAES is proposed and analyzed in this study. Based on the existing CAES plants, the hybrid-fuel CAES incorporates an external <b>combustion</b> <b>heater</b> into the power generation subsystem to heat the air from the recuperator and the air from the high-pressure air turbine.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to determine thermal and pressure-drop performance and the operational characteristics of a Stewart-Warner model 906 -B <b>combustion</b> <b>heater.</b> The performance tests covered a range of ventilating-air flows from 500 to 3185 pounds per hour, combustion-air pressure drops from 5 to 35 inches of water, and pressure altitudes from sea level to 41, 000 feet. The operational characteristics investigated were the combustion-air flows for sustained combustion and for consistent ignition covering fuel-air ratios ranging from 0. 033 to 0. 10 and pressure altitudes from sea level to 45, 000 feet. Rated heat output of 50, 000 Btu per hour was obtained at pressure altitudes up to 27, 000 feet for ventilating-air flows greater than 800 pounds per hour; rated output was not obtained at ventilating-air flow below 800 pounds per hour at any altitude. The maximum heater efficiency {{was found to be}} 60. 7 percent at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 050, a sea-level pressure altitude, a ventilating-air temperature of 0 F, combustion-air temperature of 14 F, a ventilating-air flow of 690 pounds per hour, and a combustion-air flow of 72. 7 pounds per hour. The minimum combustion-air flow for sustained combustion at a pressure altitude of 25, 000 feet was about 9 pounds per hour for fuel-air ratios between 0. 037 and 0. 099 and at a pressure altitude of 45, 000 feet increased to 18 pounds per hour at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 099 and 55 pounds per hour at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 036. Combustion could be sustained at combustion-air flows above values of practical interest. The maximum flow was limited, however, by excessively high exhaust-gas temperature or high pressure drop. Both maximum and minimum combustion-air flows for consistent ignition decrease with increasing pressure altitude and the two curves intersect at a pressure altitude of approximately 25, 000 feet and a combustion-air flow of approximately 28 pounds per hour...|$|R

50|$|Most boilers produce {{steam to}} be used at {{saturation}} temperature; that is, saturated steam. Superheated steam boilers vaporize the water and then further heat the steam in a superheater. This provides steam at much higher temperature, but can decrease the overall thermal efficiency of the steam generating plant because the higher steam temperature requires a higher flue gas exhaust temperature. There {{are several ways to}} circumvent this problem, typically by providing an economizer that heats the feed water, a <b>combustion</b> air <b>heater</b> in the hot flue gas exhaust path, or both. There are advantages to superheated steam that may, and often will, increase overall efficiency of both steam generation and its utilization: gains in input temperature to a turbine should outweigh any cost in additional boiler complication and expense. There may also be practical limitations in using wet steam, as entrained condensation droplets will damage turbine blades.|$|R
50|$|Residential <b>combustion</b> water <b>heaters</b> {{manufactured}} since 2003 in the United States {{have been}} redesigned to resist ignition of flammable vapors and incorporate a thermal cutoff switch, per ANSI Z21.10.1. The first feature attempts to prevent vapors from flammable liquids and {{gases in the}} vicinity of the heater from being ignited and thus causing a house fire or explosion. The second feature prevents tank overheating due to unusual combustion conditions. These safety requirements were made in response to homeowners storing, or spilling, gasoline or other flammable liquids near their water heaters and causing fires. Since most of the new designs incorporate some type of flame arrestor screen, they require monitoring to make sure they do not become clogged with lint or dust, reducing the availability of air for combustion. If the flame arrestor becomes clogged, the thermal cutoff may act to shut down the heater.|$|R

The primary goal is to evaluate the effects of H 2 O and CO 2, the two major vitiated species generated by <b>combustion</b> <b>heater,</b> on hydrogen-fueled supersonic combustor performance with experimental and numerical approaches. The comparative experiments in the clean air and vitiated air are conducted by using the resistance heated direct-connected facility, with the typical Mach 4 flight conditions simulated. The H 2 O and CO 2 species with accurately controlled contents {{are added to the}} high enthalpy clean air from resistance heater, to synthesize the vitiated air of a combustion-type heater. Typically, the contents of H 2 O species can be varied within the range of 3. 5 %– 30 % by mole, and 3. 0 %– 10 % for CO 2 species. The total temperature, total pressure, Mach number and O 2 mole fraction at the combustor entrance are well-matched between the clean air and vitiated air. The combustion experiments are completed at the fuel equivalence ratios of 0. 53 and 0. 42 respectively. Furthermore, three-dimensional (3 D) reacting flow simulations of combustor flowpath are performed to provide insight into flow field structures and combustion chemistry details that cannot resolved by experimental instruments available. Finally, the experimental data, combined with computational results, are employed to analyze the effects of H 2 O and CO 2 vitiated air on supersonic combustion characteristics and performance. It is concluded that H 2 O and CO 2 contaminants can significantly inhibit the combustion induced pressure rise measured from combustor wall, and the pressure profile decreases with the increasing H 2 O and CO 2 contents in nonlinear trend; simulation results agree well with experimental data and the overall vitiation effects are captured; direct extrapolation of the results from vitiated air to predict the performance of actual flight conditions could result in over-fueling the combustor, possible inlet un-start and inappropriate combustion mode transition.
