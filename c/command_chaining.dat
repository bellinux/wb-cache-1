50|$|Rotational {{position}} sensing (RPS) {{was implemented}} with two new CCWs, SET SECTOR and READ SECTOR enabled the channel to delay <b>command</b> <b>chaining</b> until the disk rotated to a specified angular track position.

The actual number of subchannels provided depends upon the system model and its configuration. [...] Sometimes described as disconnected <b>command</b> <b>chaining,</b> the control unit could disconnect at various times during a chained set of CCWs, for example, disconnection for a Seek CCW, freeing the channel for another subchannel.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Command</b> <b>chaining</b> CCWs {{could be}} chained {{together}} to construct complex channel programs. The gaps in a CKD track format provided sufficient {{time between the}} commands so that all channel and SCU activity necessary to complete a command can be performed in the a gap between appropriate fields. [...] Such programs can search {{a large amount of}} information stored on a DASD, upon successful completion returning only the desired data and thereby freeing CPU resources for other activity. [...] This mode of operating synchronous to the gap was later enhanced by addionional CCWs enabling a nonsychronous mode of operation.|$|E

5000|$|As {{part of the}} IPL {{facility}} {{the operator}} has a means of specifying a 12-bit device address, typically with three dials {{as shown in the}} operator controls drawing. When the operator selects the Load function, the system performs a System Reset, sends a Read IPL channel command to the selected device in order to read 24 bytes into locations 0-23 and causes the channel to begin fetching CCWs at location 8; the effect is as if the channel had fetched a CCW with a length of 24, and address of 0 and the flags containing <b>Command</b> <b>Chaining</b> + Suppress Length Indication. At the completion of the operation, the system stores the I/O address in the halfword at location 2 and loads the PSW from location 0.|$|E

5000|$|The IPL {{function}} in the System/360 and its successors, and its compatibles such as Amdahl's, reads 24 bytes from an operator-specified device into main storage starting at real address zero. The second and third groups of eight bytes are treated as Channel Command Words (CCWs) to continue loading the startup program (the first CCW is always simulated by the CPU and consists of a Read IPL command, 02h, with <b>command</b> <b>chaining</b> and suppress incorrect length indication being enforced). When the I/O channel commands are complete, {{the first group of}} eight bytes is then loaded into the processor's Program Status Word (PSW) and the startup program begins execution at the location designated by that PSW. [...] The IPL device is usually a disk drive, hence the special significance of the 02h read-type command, but exactly the same procedure is also used to IPL from other input-type devices, such as tape drives, or even card readers, in a device-independent manner, allowing, for example, the installation of an operating system on a brand-new computer from an OS initial distribution magnetic tape. For disk controllers, the 02h command also causes the selected device to seek to cylinder 0000h, head 0000h, simulating a Seek cylinder and head command, 07h, and to search for record 01h, simulating a Search ID Equal command, 31h; seeks and searches are not simulated by tape and card controllers, as for these device classes an 02h command is simply a sequential read command, not a Read IPL command.|$|E
