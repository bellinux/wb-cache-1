5|$|The Mummy is a 1911 American short silent film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film details the story of Jack Thornton, a businessman, who {{is in love with}} Professor Dix's daughter. Jack purchases a mummy and plans to win his respect as an Egyptologist, but the mummy is reanimated in Jack's room by a live electrical wire. The mummy takes immediate interest in Jack, but is rejected and mummifies him. Before Professor Dix can <b>cut</b> <b>up</b> the now-mummified Jack, she returns and saves him. Jack explains everything and the film concludes with Professor Dix marrying the mummy.|$|E
5|$|The major way {{bacteria}} {{defend themselves}} from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes that destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, <b>cut</b> <b>up</b> the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells. Bacteria also contain {{a system that}} uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of viruses that the bacteria have {{come into contact with}} in the past, which allows them to block the virus's replication through a form of RNA interference. This genetic system provides bacteria with acquired immunity to infection.|$|E
5|$|The railway {{was also}} {{upgraded}} at this time. Thomas Ward Ltd supplied replacement track in 1955, {{and a new}} 0-4-0 diesel electric shunter was ordered from Ruston and Hornsby Ltd in 1959. It was delivered from Lincoln on a low-loader in 1960, and was so successful that a second engine of the same type was ordered the following year. The Hudswell Clarke steam engine was <b>cut</b> <b>up</b> on site in 1962, but the Corporation wrote to Peckett's {{to see if they}} would convert the Peckett engine to diesel hydraulic transmission. Peckett's declined, and so the engine was converted at the works, by cutting off the boiler and saddle tank, and fitting a Perkins diesel engine removed from a crane. It was completed on 12 May 1962, and worked well, although it spent most of its subsequent life working at Thrybergh tip. It returned to Blackburn Meadows in 1967, and was <b>cut</b> <b>up</b> later that year. A prototype steel side-tipping wagon was ordered from Robert Hudson Ltd of Leeds in 1955, and a further 22 followed in 1957, to replace the original wooden wagons. Charles Roberts and Co Ltd of Wakefield supplied 12 more in 1958, and a further 35 in 1961, with Hudsons supplying the final 6 in 1963.|$|E

5|$|At 2:42 PM on April 11, 1945, off {{the coast}} of Kikaijima Island, a Japanese fighter pilot in an A6M5c Zero {{launched}} a kamikaze attack on the USS Missouri. Bill Obitz, a Seaman at the time, recalled that the attacking plane approached at an extreme angle and estimated that it was 20 feet (6 m) above the water. Although struck by intense antiaircraft fire, the plane survived and struck the ship's starboard side at frame 169 below the main deck. While the impact of one of the plane's wings started a fire at 5-inch mount number 3, its 500-pound bomb did not detonate, so the damage was minimal. There were no American casualties, but the Japanese pilot died. Parts of the plane's wreckage and {{the top half of the}} pilot's body landed on board the Missouri. The plane's wing was turned over to the crew to be <b>cut</b> <b>up</b> for souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, a new diesel {{shunting}} locomotive, made by Thomas Hill of Rotherham was purchased. It {{was built}} at Kilnhurst, and driven along the ex-Great Central Railway line {{from there to}} the works. The first Ruston and Hornsby engine was partially dismantled, and eventually <b>cut</b> <b>up</b> in January 1978. The connection between the works and the British Rail network was cut in 1984, and the system became one of {{a very small number of}} isolated standard gauge railways. By 1986, the track layout had been simplified, and the track across Jordan bridge had been lifted. When rail operation ceased in the 1990s, one of the Hudson tipping wagons went to the National Railway Museum at Shildon, and the Thomas Hill engine, after several changes of ownership, is now located on the Peak Rail preserved railway at Matlock.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the worsening security situation, William conducted his second northern campaign in 1069. He built another castle in York, on what is now Baile Hill {{on the west bank}} of the Ouse opposite the first castle, in an effort to improve his control over the city. This second castle was also a motte and bailey design, with the Baile Hill motte probably reached by a horizontal bridge and steps <b>cut</b> <b>up</b> the side of the motte. Later that year, a Danish Viking fleet sailed up to York along the Humber and the Ouse, and attacked both castles with the assistance of Cospatrick of Northumbria and a number of local rebels. The Normans, attempting to drive the rebels back, set fire to some of the city's houses. The fire grew out of control and also set fire to York Minster and, some argue, the castles as well. The castles were captured and partially dismantled, and Malet was taken hostage by the Danes.|$|E
5000|$|The phrase [...] "Society for <b>Cutting</b> <b>Up</b> Men" [...] is on {{the cover}} of the 1967 self-published edition, after the title, in [...] "'Presentation of ... SCUM (Society for <b>Cutting</b> <b>Up</b> Men) ....'" [...] This edition precedes all {{commercial}} editions. Additionally, in the August 10, 1967 issue of The Village Voice, a letter to the editor appears that was signed by a Valerie Solanas (of SCUM, West 23rd Street) that responds to a previous letter signed by a Ruth Herschberger (published in the August 3, 1967 issue) that asks why women do not rebel against men. Solanas's response reads: [...] "I would like to inform her and other proud, independent, females like her of the existence of SCUM (Society for <b>Cutting</b> <b>Up</b> Men), a recently conceived organization which will be getting into high gear (and I mean high) within a few weeks.|$|R

5|$|The Anthony Roll is {{a record}} of ships of the English Tudor navy of the 1540s, named after its creator, Anthony Anthony. It {{originally}} consisted of three rolls of vellum, depicting 58naval vessels along with information on their size, crew, armament, and basic equipment. The rolls were presented to KingHenry VIII in 1546, and were kept in the royal library. In 1680 Charles II gave two of the rolls to Samuel Pepys, who had them <b>cut</b> <b>up</b> and bound as a single volume book, which {{is now in the}} Pepys Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge. The third roll remained in the royal collection until it was given by William IV to his daughter, Mary Fox, who sold it to the British Museum in 1858; it is now owned by the British Library.|$|E
5|$|The Brick Lane {{screening}} – on 8 December 1995 – {{had been}} previewed in NME, and was chaotically busy. It was originally planned {{for a car}} park, but freezing conditions and snow forced a rethink and the screening was moved indoors, to {{the basement of the}} nearby Seven Stars pub. Hundreds of people crammed in to watch the screening, which was eventually abandoned partway through due to the cramped conditions. The NME preview had claimed that after the screening the film would be <b>cut</b> <b>up</b> and individual frames sold off to the public. Gimpo, the owner of the film, had no intention of doing so, but after the screening was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of people wanting to take home a piece of the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning after}} the battle, forty young noblemen from Besançon, {{suspected}} of sympathizing with the Protestant insurgents, were executed after lengthy torture sessions. Other citizens suspected of heresy would receive the same punishment—some were imprisoned; others were banished from the city, or had their money and possessions taken away. Many citizens were publicly hanged {{in front of the}} city hall. Some Protestants were hanged, beheaded, and quartered, while some others were dragged onto a publicly displayed pile of bodies. Some Protestant corpses were <b>cut</b> <b>up</b> and the pieces exposed on the city gates. Masses were held at St. Jean's Cathedral and St. Stephen's Cathedral of Besançon to celebrate the defeat of the Huguenots.|$|E

5|$|The {{stranding}} of the Northern bottlenose whale mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík. It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem of the whale, because there are isthmuses on these places, where the distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer or so. And for some reason it seems like the bottlenose whale want to take a short cut through what it thinks is a sound, and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again. It happened on 30 August 2012, when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge Sigmundsgjógv in Sandvík. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then <b>cut</b> <b>up</b> for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|E
5|$|Though seldom life-threatening, the {{electric}} discharge of an Atlantic torpedo is quite severe {{and may be}} enough to knock a person unconscious. However, a greater danger to divers is the disorientation that follows the shock. The Atlantic torpedo is of no commercial value, as its meat is flabby and tasteless. It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. When caught at sea, it is generally discarded or <b>cut</b> <b>up</b> for bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough data to assess the Atlantic torpedo beyond Data Deficient; it could be negatively affected by fishing mortality, though specific data on catch rates and population trends are lacking, {{as well as by}} the degradation of coral reefs that are important to juveniles. Its slow reproductive rate would limit its capacity to recover from population depletion.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the aforementioned Topaze, casualties were minimal: none were recorded on Jason and Hazard and none in the French battery on shore. Cleopatra, due to the poor position and accuracy of her opponent, lost only two men killed and one wounded, the most serious damage being to her masts and rigging, which were badly <b>cut</b> <b>up.</b> Losses among the French that didn't attempt to flee crew in the engagement were also relatively light, with 12 dead and 14 wounded, although a number of men were killed in their attempt to swim for shore after Topaze had surrendered. The French frigate was badly damaged, particularly in her hull, and required extensive repairs before she was fit for service in the Royal Navy, commissioned under the new name of HMS Alcmene.|$|E
