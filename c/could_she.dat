They sought refuge in Strassbourg, a stronghold of Calvinism. Gebhard {{had been a member of}} the Cathedral Chapter there since 1576. Three other canons from Cologne had also taken refuge in Strassbourg after 1583. Shortly after their {{marriage}} in 1583, Gebhard had written his Testament in which he left his estate to his brother, Karl, and a life-time annuity to Agnes, and charged Karl with her safety and protection. Karl died on 18June 1593, and was buried in the Strasbourg cathedral; Gebhard wrote a codicil leaving Agnes to the care and protection of the Dukes of Württemberg. Gebhard died on 21 May 1601. Until her death in 1637, she lived under the protection of the Dukes, first Friedrich I, later Johann Friedrich and then his son Eberhard. She was buried in Sulzbach.|$|E
5|$|A {{second group}} of 770 {{children}} from Stara Gradiška followed on 13–14July, while a third, consisting of another 850 children were transported from the Adriatic coastal village of Jablanac {{at the end of}} the month. On 5August, 800 more children arrived from the concentration camp at Mlaka. The last group arrived from the nearby village of Gornja Reka on 14August with 150 children, all boys. In total, 3,136 children arrived at the camp up to 14August. According to the historian Dragoje Lukić, a total of 3,336 children passed through the camp during its existence, aged between one and fourteen years old. One survivor, Dušanka Šmitran, who had previously been held at one of the sub-camps of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex, stated that she was dragged away from her mother at the sub-camp and they were packed tightly into railway wagons for the journey. On arrival in Zagreb, she said they were taken to the Croatian Red Cross building where they were washed, had their hair cut, and were allowed to eat as much as they <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> remarked that this was the only time such things occurred during her time in the Ustaše camps.|$|E

He has been trying to get a {{foothold}} in pictures for eight years but received no encouragement although he tried every angle known to town—extra work, bit parts, stock contracts, dramatic schools, assault of the casting offices. Sue Carol, the former silent star who is now an agent, undertook to advance the youth's career two years ago and only recently <b>could</b> <b>she</b> locate an attentive ear.

25|$|The {{conflict}} split her family. Her {{son was a}} reigning prince in Germany and {{her younger}} daughter was the Kaiser's daughter in law. In the opposite side, her brothers in Russia were fighting to defeat the Central Powers. Anastasia sided with her native country. Technically a German princess, the grand duchess could neither remain in France, a country at war with Germany, nor <b>could</b> <b>she</b> return to Schwerin, now an enemy of her native Russia. Therefore, she decided to settle in neutral Switzerland. She spent the war years living at the Savoy Hotel in Lausanne, giving her villa in Cannes {{for use as a}} hospital for wounded officers of the Russian Expeditionary Force in France.|$|E
25|$|At {{some time}} in 1589 Crane married her second husband, George Carleton, {{and it was as}} Elizabeth Carleton that she was {{examined}} on 1 October 1589 by the ecclesiastical commissioners. She refused to answer any of the questions put to her on the ground that she would neither be 'her own hangman' nor <b>could</b> <b>she</b> 'in her conscience be an accuser of others'. Together with Sir Richard Knightley, John Hales, and Roger Wigston and his wife, she was imprisoned in the Fleet. The interrogations of Knightley, Hales and the Wigstons likewise failed to elicit the identity of Martin Marprelate, which appears to have been unknown to those who harboured the secret press.|$|E
25|$|Tabloids {{from the}} time claimed that, at some point after her infant {{daughter}} and husband both died, a Boston medium told her (while supposedly channeling her late husband) that she should leave her home in New Haven and travel West, where she must continuously build a home for herself and the spirits {{of people who had}} fallen victim to Winchester rifles. Winchester left New Haven and headed for California. Though it is possible she was simply seeking a change of location and a hobby during her lengthy depression, other sources claim that Winchester came to believe her family and fortune were haunted by ghosts, and that only by moving West and continuously building them a house <b>could</b> <b>she</b> appease these spirits.|$|E

'If this is the beginning, what will the end be!' {{she said in a}} whisper, and felt many misgivings as to the policy of being overhasty in establishing an independence at the expense of congruity with a cherished past.|$|R
60|$|The {{room was}} empty, {{all the men}} having gone out upon the walk to escape the heat, and she took her seat behind her desk and gave herself up to a {{consideration}} of the life to which the possession of so much wealth would introduce her. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> have unlimited new gowns, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> travel, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> rescue her mother from drudgery and worry.

25|$|The 1920s {{left the}} family in straitened {{financial}} circumstances, {{and they had to}} give up their country estate and move to Warsaw. In 1930, when Krystyna was 22, Count Jerzy died. The Goldfeder financial empire had almost completely collapsed, and there was barely enough money to support the widowed Countess Stefania. Krystyna, not wishing to be a burden to her mother, worked at a Fiat car dealership, but soon became ill from automobile fumes and had to give up the job. At first she was thought, on the basis of shadows on her chest x-rays, to be suffering from tuberculosis, which had killed her father. She received compensation from her employer's insurance company and took her physicians' advice to lead as much of an open-air life as she <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> began spending {{a great deal of time}} hiking and skiing the Tatra Mountains.|$|E
25|$|Bligh then {{resumed his}} station with the Channel Fleet, patrolling off the French ports. On 3 February 1810 {{he came across}} the French ship Confiance, a former frigate that had been {{purchased}} by the merchants of the Île de France to transport their goods back to France. At the time Bligh had been sailing in company with the 74-gun , and under the orders of her captain, Henry Hotham. On 1 February Hotham had ordered Bligh to follow him into Quiberon Bay, but Valiant was unable to weather the point, nor <b>could</b> <b>she</b> make progress in the light winds the following day. She was therefore still off Belle Île on 3 February, when the Confiance came in sight. Confiance had evaded British blockaders and cruisers during the entirety of her voyage, having escaped pursuit fourteen times in her 93-day passage from the Indian Ocean. Hampered by light winds, {{she was unable to}} escape the Valiant, and finally surrendered to her just a few hours away from reaching safety in a French port. Her cargo was valued at £800,000, of which Bligh received £14,041.|$|E

500|$|Leicester—a widower since 1560—had {{for many}} years been in hope of marrying Elizabeth herself, [...] "for whose sake he had {{hitherto}} forborne marriage", as he confessed to Lord North. He also feared Elizabeth's reaction and insisted that his marriage be kept a secret. It did not remain one for long, the French ambassador, Michel de Castelnau, reporting it only two months later. When the Queen was told of the marriage the next year, she banished Lettice Dudley permanently from court; she never forgave her cousin, nor <b>could</b> <b>she</b> ever accept the marriage. Even Lady Leicester's movements through London were resented by the Queen, let alone summer visits to Kenilworth by husband and wife.|$|E

The day began at 6am, changing into costumes and getting onto the actors' bus, which took them to the sets in Kanuria. The actors, including Aamir, all travelled on the same bus. If anyone missed it, it was up to them to reach the sets. One day, Aamir was late and missed the actors' bus. That day, his wife Reena, the executive producer, reprimanded him for being late. She told him he had to set an example {{for the rest of the}} crew. [...] "If he started coming late, how <b>could</b> <b>she</b> tell the others to come on time?" [...] While on the sets, the actors were given call sheets with the day's timetable such as breakfast, hair styling, make-up, costumes, etc.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Piece of Me" [...] was filmed on November 27 and November 28, 2007, at the nightclub and {{restaurant}} Social Hollywood in Los Angeles, California. It {{was directed by}} Wayne Isham, who had previously worked with Spears on the music video of [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman". British national newspaper Daily Mail reported that the video cost $500,000, her most expensive music video since the music video for [...] "Toxic". In some scenes of the music video, Spears wore a purple satin dress from American designer Marina Toybina. Spears reportedly arrived twelve hours late to the set, after spending the day with her sons Sean Preston and Jayden James. Isham talked about the situation, saying, [...] "She was late. People made a big thing about it, [...] how <b>could</b> <b>she</b> not be late, when you have 50, 65, 75 people running down the street chasing her car? That was a long day for the crew. It was literally a 20-hour day for the crew. She {{was there for the}} last six hours of it. She got there late, showed up and just kicked ass".

500|$|Gwenda Robb and Elaine Smith, {{in their}} Concise Dictionary of Australian Artists, {{considered}} Fuller's art {{to be created}} in [...] "a free painterly style indebted to Impressionism". During {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century, reviews drew attention to her distinctively Australian style. When one of Fuller's works was included in an exhibition of colonial artists in London (including paintings from Canada and Australia), the [...] correspondent from the Adelaide Advertiser described Fuller's contribution as [...] "most Australian in feeling". Reviewing her work hung in the Royal Academy in 1904, a Perth critic reported: [...] "Of the 16 or 17 Australian artists exhibiting at the Academy, Miss Fuller was the only one who chose a typically Australian scene. Her picture shows a young girl in thin white, clinging, dress, standing on a bushy piece of country... As the London Observer says, the atmosphere that bathes the graceful figure of the girl is capitally managed with its note of subtropical heat". One reviewer thought very highly of her portraits, but was less convinced about Fuller's approach to the Australian light, writing:She had less success with our landscapes than with her figure subjects. That was the result of her passion for toning her pictures for ultimate indoor hanging. Thereby she lost, or illuminated, the hard Australian, hard light and shade, and startling relative values. Observable too was the influence of the English school in her rendering of our foliage; never <b>could</b> <b>she</b> bring herself to see our trees as dim coloured as they usually are.|$|E
