40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the psychometric properties}} of the Korean short form- 36 health survey version 2 for assessing the general population and to provide normative data on the general population. Methods: Six hundred members of the general Korean population were recruited using a multistage quota sampling method. Data quality was evaluated in terms of the completeness of the data and the response consistency index. Each psychometric property was evaluated using descriptive statistics, item internal consistency, item discriminant validity, known-group validity, internal consistency reliability, and exploratory factor analysis. Results: The rate of missing data was low, and the rate of consistent responses was similar to conventional criteria. Item internal consistency was acceptable across all scales, whilst item discriminant validity was satisfactory for five of the eight scales. Social functioning was the least acceptable in terms of not only item discriminant validity but also item consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = . 64). Test-retest Pearson correlation coefficients ranged from. 54 to. 80. In known group comparison, male sex, age < 60 years, high educational status, and the absence of any comorbidities were associated with higher scores than their <b>counterparts.</b> <b>Item</b> factor analysis yields the presence of six factors, accounting for 68. 8 % of the variance. Conclusion: The findings of this study generally support the use of the Korean short form- 36 version 2 for evaluating the general population, although caution is recommended when interpreting the vitality, social functioning, and mental health scales. Further research is needed in Korea...|$|R

The {{purpose of the study was}} to develop a valid and reliable visual test instrument to ascertain if differences in visual preference existed between Mexican American and non-Mexican American high school students. The design of the instrument was based on Type 1 and Type 2 form objects. Type 1 items reflected items relevant to Mexican American culture. Type 2 <b>items</b> were <b>counterpart</b> <b>items</b> that differed along a cultural character dimension. Type 1 and Type 2 items were paired. Scale construction followed three phases. Phase 1 included development of the initial test pairs and content validity testing, utilizing art expert group judgment. Validity testing examined the equal artistic quality of the pairs and more Mexican slide in a pair. Phase 1 produced an initial instrument of 60 pairs (including 20 "dummy" pairs). Phase 2 focused on instrument modification through pilot testing with Mexican American and non-Mexican American high school students. Test results were used to weed out "bad" and "neutral" functioning items. Twenty-seven pairs were retained as "good" items in this manner and combined with 8 "dummy" slides for a final scale of 35 pairs. Phase 3 involved testing the final scale on Mexican American and non-Mexican American students from a second high school. Test results failed to show well-marked agreement in preference for the more Mexican items by Mexican Americans. (Instrument reliability was. 712.) Additional testing with a more Mexican-oriented group from a third high school was conducted to re-examine the power of the scale to discriminate. These tests failed to show improved results. Further, this group showed an increase in preference for non-Mexican items lending confusion to the issue of ethnic background influence on visual preference. (Instrument reliability was $-. 180 $.) Although the scale failed to prove itself as a valid and reliable instrument, study results provided important information suggesting that the issue of ethnic influence on visual preference is complex; and that in advocating cultural diversity, caution should be exercised when making assumptions regarding its effect on behavior to avoid further stereotyping the culturally different...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of Whiplash-Associated Disorders cannot currently be understood from a biomedical perspective. In contrast to disability, which is frequently seen {{in patients with}} WAD, cervical tissue lesions or other biomedical sequellae are seldom found. The approach of WAD from a perspective of functioning and health is an alternative for the biomedical model and {{can be helpful in}} assessing and understanding the patients complaints, clinical characteristics and the course of the disorder. The characteristics of a conceptual framework related to functioning and health were explored, with help of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). For the assessment of functioning and health in patients with WAD, {{there is a need for}} brief and clinically applicable, condition specific questionnaires for assessment of functioning in patients with WAD. Currently, the Neck Bournemouth Questionnaire (NBQ) is the only self-assessment questionnaire that meets these criteria. After thorough translation, the construct validity, content validity and reliability of the Dutch NBQ (NBQ-NL) was assessed in respect of assessment of WAD from a perspective of functioning and health. Content validity was assessed in relation to the separate constructs of the ICF, by means of Discriminant Content Validity. Results of the study showed moderate to good correlation coefficients, but arguable limits of agreement in relation to the NBQ questionnaire <b>items</b> and <b>counterpart</b> <b>items</b> of other questionnaires. The NBQ-NL showed excellent test-retest reliability, with an ICC of 0. 92 for repeated measurements. The NBQ-NL showed to be a multidimensional questionnaire, but most items measure a mixture of constructs within the theoretical framework of the ICF. In clinical practice, there is a need for a consensus based set of measures for the assessment of functioning and health in patients with WAD. Such a core set, may improve clinical decision-making. A consensus based preliminary core set for assessment of patients with acute, sub acute and chronic WAD was developed, with help of a Delphi-study. The preliminary core set of 27 assessment instruments (questionnaires and physical measures). The preliminary core set contains all ICF constructs. Additionally, a WAD-specific questionnaire was developed. This Whiplash Activity and Participation List (WAL) is a 38 item, condition-specific questionnaire based on clinical experience of experts and on patients’ experience. The WAL measures the ICF construct “activity and participation”. The relative contribution of cervical impairments and psychosocial factors to perceived disability among people with chronic whiplash associated disorders was examined, within a cross sectional design. Results of our study show that depressive symptomatology and catastrophizing explained 61 % of the variance in NDI scores. Catastrophizing explained 57 % of the variance in NDI scores and 15 % of the variance in the sum scores of active cervical rotations...|$|R

The particular focus {{of the study was to}} investigate effects resulting from the addition of a small number of items to the active learning scale designed to capture some highly engaging, mostly online, activities. The items were developed in response to concerns that students studying in distance mode often report lower average scores on active learning scales than their on-campus <b>counterparts.</b> The additional <b>items</b> relate to activities such as working online with other students and faculty. The findings show that average scores on the Australasian Survey of Student Engagement/National Survey of Student Engagement scale increase significantly when the new items are included and that some differences between on-campus and distance education students narrow significantly.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The {{purposes}} of this study were to (a) provide insight into the use of item response theory (IRT) with psychomotor skills, (b) assess the psychometric properties of the Test of Gross Motor Development (TGMD) using IRT, and (c) provide a basis for future studies of the TGMD using IRT. The dichotomously scored TGMD is a test instrument which measures psychomotor skills in a framework similar to cognitive tests, thus providing a convenient "transitional" type test which can be used to examine the use of IRT with psychomotor skill tests. The present study employed data used by Ulrich (1985) in the original psychometric analysis of the TGMD. The data consisted of 913 subjects aged 3 to 10 years, nonhandicapped and 20 mildly mentally handicapped. Since IRT cannot provide accurate ability estimates at mastery levels of 0 % and 100 % mastery, 32 subjects were deleted from the record. Since the TGMD was found to be multidimensional, the test was analyzed by subtests so not to violate the unidimensionality assumption of IRT. Interpretation of traditional item statistics using classical test theory (CTT) and IRT item parameters revealed that item difficulty and item discrimination were closely related. The locomotor IRT difficulty parameters revealed a high negative correlation (r = -. 87) with the CTT difficulty statistics, while the object control IRT difficulty parameters displayed a very high negative correlation (r = -. 98) with their CTT <b>counterparts.</b> <b>Item</b> response theory discrimination parameters correlated highly with CTT discrimination statistics within the locomotor (r =. 91) and the object control (r =. 94) subtests. IRT analysis revealed that the locomotor subtest was less difficult (median difficulty = -. 944) than the object control subtest (median difficulty =. 053) and the object control subtest displayed a better discrimination index (median = 2. 17) than the locomotor subtest (median = 1. 54). In addition to difficulty and discrimination indices, IRT also provided the amount of information given by each item and subtest, which indicated the precision in measuring various ability levels. The locomotor subtest information was reported at I = 15. 50, indicating adequate precision to measure low ability (Θ = - 1. 857). The object control information function showed that the subtest displayed more information (I = 18. 24) at a slightly higher ability level (Θ = - 1. 643). The results of the item analysis revealed that all items (behavioral criteria) of the hop, leap, and the overhand throw displayed effective psychometric properties, while 9 out of 12 skills contained items that displayed poor psychometric characteristics and/or did not fit the two-parameter model. The run (items 1, 3, and 4), gallop (items 6 and 8), horizontal jump (item 18), skip (item 20), slide (items 23, 24, 25, 26), strike (items 27, 28, and 29), stationary bounce (item 32), catch (item 34 and 35), and the kick (item 38) should be revised. Since the TGMD is also used as a criterion-referenced test the decision validity of the mastery classification cut-off scores was analyzed. For the {{purposes of}} these analyses true mastery state was determined by IRT because it provides an estimation of underlying ability. It was found that IRT and CTT showed a high agreement of classifying masters and nonmasters at the 70 % and 85 % levels of mastery. The locomotor subtest revealed a decision validity coefficient of. 93 and. 99 for the 70 % and 85 % mastery levels, respectively. The object control subtest revealed higher decision validity coefficients of. 99 and. 997 for the 70 % and 85 % mastery levels, respectively. The TGMD subtests were found to best measure very low mastery levels, where the most precision for measuring ability represented 30 % and 45 % mastery for the locomotor and object control subtests, respectively. Item response theory has been successfully employed in the cognitive and affective domains and shows great promise for the psychomotor domain. The present study set forth evidence that the IRT two-parameter logistic model provides an effective psychometric analysis of dichotomously scored psychomotor skills. The theory addresses many of the shortcomings of CTT, such as the inability to generalize item statistics to various populations and determine the contribution of test items independently. The invariance property of IRT is very appealing to those who must assess atypical populations because a single test can accommodate various populations and wide ranges of ability. The results of this study provide evidence that the characteristics of IRT are well suited to improve measurement and evaluation in the psychomotor domain...|$|R

Both of them {{belong to a}} larger set of metallic objects, some being part of tomb ornaments belonging to two very well distinct periods of frequentation of the site. Both items are buckles {{and they have been}} selected as representative of two very well-known and established typologies. The older one, {{at the end of the}} sixth— beginning of the seventh century AD, is made of silver, although relicts of gold have been found. A number of relevant <b>counterparts</b> of this <b>item</b> have been found in different sites of the Longobard Italy. The main body of the second artefact (second half of the fourteenth century AD) consists of a bent strip of a copper rich alloy, coated on one side with a nearly continuous, decorated, gold layer. This is a socalled lyre-buckle, with a widespread diffusion not only in Italian, but also North European contexts. From the results of the analyses carried out using low-vacuum scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffractometry, information on manufacturing, gilding technology and materials have been obtained that will be an useful benchmark for the archaeometric characterization of similar items from selected collections. In this way, the already established typological affinity of these two classes of items will be extended to technological and materials aspects, als...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} psychometrics in South Africa faces many challenges. Among these are, that {{practitioners}} {{in the field}} of psychology do not always have access to standardised assessments for the South African context. Imported assessments pose various biases to South Africa’s multilingual and multicultural situations, hence the need for test adaptation. The Suffolk Reading Scale (2) (SRS 2) is an English proficiency assessment that measures reading comprehension. English, being the language of learning and teaching in most South African schools, makes the SRS 2 a significant gain to practitioners and the field of psychometrics. Consequently, this research aimed to narrow the gaps in this area of knowledge and contribute to it by evaluating the applicability of the SRS 2 as a measure of reading comprehension for South African learners. Primary school learners in Kwa-Zulu Natal were administered the SRS 2. The {{purpose of the study was}} to ascertain the degree of reliability of the SRS 2. Of the 338 participants, 51. 9 percent (n= 140) of the sample were female, and 48. 1 percent (n= 130) were male. Sixty-six percent (n= 164) of the participants spoke English as an Additional Language (EAL), while thirty-four percent (n= 83) spoke English as a first language (EFL). Results indicated a significant difference in performance between EFL and EAL learners, whereby EAL learners performed lower than EFL learners. However there was no difference in performance between female learners and their male <b>counterparts</b> on individual <b>items</b> of the SRS 2.

40|$|International {{evidence}} has consistently {{shown that the}} prevalence of substance use disorders is highest amongst young adults in the general population. However, {{questions have been raised}} as to whether the apparent &# 145;youthful epidemic&# 146; of substance use disorders is real or a methodological artefact of the prevailing classification systems. Recent reviews of the literature indicate three unresolved issues in this field of study: 1) What is the epidemiology of substance use disorders amongst young adults in the general population?; 2) Is there evidence of age-related bias in the substance use disorder criteria?; and 3) What are the possible sources of age-related bias in the substance use disorder criteria? The current thesis addresses these issues by developing and employing sophisticated statistical analyses and novel investigative techniques. This thesis empirically examines the apparent &# 145;youthful epidemic&# 146; of substance use disorders in the general population. At the diagnostic level, substance use disorders were found to be highly prevalent, comorbid, severe and, in the case of alcohol use disorders, disabling amongst young adults (16 - 24 years olds) in the Australian general population. Criterion level analyses also indicated that young adults in the general population endorse almost each of the substance use disorder criteria at considerably higher rates than their older <b>counterparts.</b> However, differential <b>item</b> functioning, as implemented within the framework of item response theory, identified age-based bias in some of the substance use disorder criteria. To understand the sources of this bias, techniques informed by survey methodology indicated that young adults may misinterpret some of the substance use disorder criteria. This misinterpretation may lead to an inflation of the rates of substance use disorders in younger age groups in the general population. Thus, whilst the &# 145;youthful epidemic&# 146; of substance use disorders was supported by empirical evidence, some of the substance use disorder criteria appear problematic when applied to younger age groups. This thesis concludes with recommended modifications to the criteria that will increase the applicability of the substance use disorder criteria across all age groups in the general population...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to compare the performance patterns of healthy younger and older women and men on a Large Space Spatial Memory Task, and a Small Space test of Immediate and Delayed Free Recall, Immediate Recognition, and Immediate and Delayed Spatial Recall. The major findings of the study were that (1) older adults who were similar in ability to their younger <b>counterparts</b> on verbal (<b>item)</b> Free Recall and Recognition Memory demonstrated impaired Spatial Memory on both the Small and Large Space Tasks; (2) Spatial Memory on the Small Space Task was impaired even when Free Recall performance was entered into the analysis as a covariate; (3) only the younger group demonstrated task-general learning, reflected in improved performance from the Practice to the first Learning Trial; (4) learning rates on the Large Space Task were not significantly different; (5) spatial representations of both groups remained stable {{even in the absence of}} some environmental cues (Probe Trials), and when the cues were rotated relative to the walls of the environment (Performance Trials), suggesting an encoding, rather than a retrieval deficit in older individuals; (6) similar performance on tests of Free Recall and Recognition Memory in the presence of impaired Spatial Memory suggests particular vulnerability of spatial memory to the healthy aging process; (7) distinct patterns of performance on the Large and Small Space Tasks, in addition to the results of a factor analysis, indicate that the demands of the two tasks are quite different: these patterns suggest that performance on the Small Space Task may reflect gene ral memory skills and perhaps intelligence level, whereas performance on the Large Space Task may reflect more purely spatial memory. However, ceiling effects on the Large Space Task may have obscured some group differences. Therefore, further investigation of these effects will be required. The current findings are discussed in terms of possible neurobiological substrates, and provide focus for future investigations of brain-behavior relationships...|$|R
40|$|Spearman’s factor-analytic {{model has}} been {{proposed}} as a unidimensional linear item response theory (IRT) model for continuous item responses. This article first proposes a reexpression of the model {{that leads to a}} form similar to that of standard IRT models for binary responses and discusses the item indices of difficulty discrimination and information. Next, the extension to the multiple-factor model is considered, and multidimensional <b>counterparts</b> of the <b>item</b> indices are proposed. The interpretation of the proposed measures and their usefulness in personality and attitude measurement are discussed and illustrated by means of two empirical examples. Index terms: factor analysis, item response theory, item difficulty, item discrimination, item information, multidimensional item indices, personality and attitude measurement When it is used for item analysis, linear factor analysis (FA) can be conceptualized as a domi-nance model (Coombs, 1964) intended for continuous-unlimited item responses. In practice, item responses are bounded and, {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, discrete, so the FA model can be only approximately correct. More specifically, because the response is bounded, the simple linear and homoscedastic model cannot be strictly correct because some trait values would lead to expected response values outside the boundaries of the item format. Furthermore, the conditional distribu-tion of the item responses would be expected to become more asymmetrical and have decreased variance toward the ends of the scale (e. g., Ferrando, 2002). If a nonlinear heteroscedastic model such as Samejima’s (1973, 1974) is considered to be theoretically correct, and if linear FA is considered to be an approximation, then a generally well-known result is that the approximation will be better when the items have moderate or low discriminations and not extreme locations (Ferrando, 2002; Lord, 1952, 1953). In practical applications, evidence suggests that the use of linear FA can be problematic in the case of binary items or graded items with very few response points. However, with more continuou...|$|R
