50|$|<b>Cybermedicine</b> {{is already}} being used in small {{projects}} where images are transmitted from a primary care setting to a medical specialist, who comments on the case and suggests which intervention might benefit the patient. A field that lends itself to this approach is dermatology, where images of an eruption are communicated to a hospital specialist who determines if referral is necessary.|$|E

40|$|The {{model of}} health care offerings via the Internet, {{generally}} known as 2 ̆ 2 <b>cybermedicine,</b> 2 ̆ 2 {{may prove to be}} a significant advance in the provision of medical services. At present, however, <b>cybermedicine</b> presents many potential hazards to 2 ̆ 2 cyberpatients 2 ̆ 2 because it is virtually unregulated. This Note asserts the need for a revival of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine to address these dangers. The corporate practice of medicine doctrine prohibits corporations and other lay entities from employing physicians. This Note examines the various kinds of <b>cybermedicine,</b> describes the advantages and disadvantages flowing from the practice of medicine over the Internet, and advocates the application of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine to <b>cybermedicine</b> as an intermediate regulatory measure to stein the dangers and abuses that currently abound in <b>cybermedicine...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Continued {{advances}} in information technologies, computing and communication systems are enabling improved access to healthcare information, health services, {{research and education}} independent of distance. Combined they constitute the concept of Telehealth and are allowing enhanced means of sharing knowledge and expertise, “leap-fogging ” over the barriers of distance and time. Global development and integration of communication systems such as Internet 2 are creating opportunities for international collaboration using Telehealth as a platform for information and technology exchange {{with the potential to}} create a true “network of networks ” and a “virtual collaborative model ” that can be used world-wide.

40|$|Medical {{informatics}} {{is a basic}} biomedical {{science that}} has {{a wide variety of}} application areas which involve improvements in the management of any information relevant to patient care and community health. Oncoinformatics is an application science under this broad field. This area applies informatics, internet, and interactive technologies with the aim of improving the standards of care for the cancer patient. The rapid growth of the World Wide Web as a tool for global connectivity has impacted the way in which health-related information is distributed and accessed over the internet. Many people frequently use the internet for the searching of drug and other health-related information. Oncoinformatics has enabled the collation of a huge amount of information in the area of oncology. Several oncology-specific databases and blogs that are clinically relevant are described in this paper. The impact of informatics technologies and <b>cybermedicine</b> in oncology is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{represents}} {{that how}} Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is influencing the health services. Emergence of Internet has boosted {{the use of}} this technology and now this has become an imitable source of healthcare services. We have listed the technologies that are being used to cure the patient in various medical sectors and hospitals. Further, comparison between traditional methods of treatment and methods that include ICT, shows that it is beneficial to implement ICT to provide e-health services which helps developing countries to reduce cost of treatment. As obvious that installation cost is more but after implementation it becomes more facilitating solution. Conclusion can be made that if technology is easy to understand, learn and implement as well as solves various problems at a one stretch then no harm in its procurement even though installation cost is a bit high because after effects are more beneficial.

40|$|Health-care has rapidly evolved {{with the}} {{informatics}} revolution. The {{rapid growth of}} the world-wide web {{as a tool for}} global connectivity has affected the way in which health-related information is distributed and accessed over the internet. Many informatics and internet applications are now available for use by both oncology health-care professionals and patients with cancer, with many people using the internet to search for drug-related and other health-related information. The practice of pharmaceutical care aims to ensure optimum medication-related therapeutic outcomes in patients, and involves identifying, solving, and preventing potential or actual drug-related problems (DRPs) with regards to a patient's drug therapy. Pharmacoinformatics involves the use of informatics, the internet, and interactive technologies to solve DRPs, with a focus on providing optimum pharmaceutical care and improved patient safety. This paper highlights the different pharmacoinformatics channels that have been used in the provision of pharmaceutical care, which are relevant to both oncology health-care professionals and patients with cancer. We will discuss several issues that have arisen as a result of <b>cybermedicine,</b> which can potentially affect the quality of pharmaceutical care in patients with cancer, and also provide insights into how pharmacoinformatics can potentially affect the future of healthcare. The opportunity of integrating pharmacoinformatics in the practice of clinical oncology as an aid to solve DRPs is indeed appealing. Oncology practitioners should not only focus on the acquistion of new treatment strategies, but also continue to embrace and harness new information and communication technologies, so as to increase their efficiency and improve on the pharmaceutical care of patients with cancer...|$|E
40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s rapidly {{changing}} world of e-commerce, almost {{anything can be}} bought over the Internet and delivered right to your front door. Virtually every day there is news of yet another company selling some type of product online. Included in this barrage of products is prescription medication. Not only {{is it possible to}} order prescription medication over the Internet, in some cases {{it is not necessary to}} be examined, or even to consult with a physician. To some, this new type of 2 ̆ 2 <b>cybermedicine</b> 2 ̆ 2 is an affront to traditional medicine, as well as potentially dangerous to consumers. In addition, the availability of medication over the Internet presents a vexing and complex challenge to state and federal agencies charged with enforcing drug laws. This problem has recently led to the Commerce Committee of the U. S. House hold hearings on the subject in an effort to understand what is involved with this new type of medicine, and which federal and state agencies have jurisdiction over online prescription sales. Unfortunately, it still remains unclear as to exactly which agencies do have jurisdiction. Nevertheless, as Congress and individual states rush to address the issue, entrepreneurs and drugstore chains are racing to establish the next on-line pharmacy. For consumers, the idea of dealing with a 2 ̆ 2 cyber-pharmacy 2 ̆ 2 is appealing for several reasons. Lower cost and convenience for elderly people or those living in rural areas, as well as the ability to privately consult with a pharmacist are just a few of the benefits often cited. IO But in addition to these advantages, there are still substantial risks. These include easy access to illegal or unapproved drugs, medication offered without a prescription, and drugs marketed with fake health claims. As the confusion over online pharmacies mounts, one thing is clear; this new type of medicine is growing at a substantial rate. This comment will attempt to define and explain the tremendous growth of online pharmacies. Next it will examine pending legislation and current cases relating to the sale of medication online. Finally this comment will examine the risks and benefits of ordering medications online, and what consumers should do to protect themselves as well as comply with the Jaw...|$|E
