40|$|The {{porosimetry}} of the <b>catalyst</b> layer {{made by the}} 'decal process' was studied using mercury porosirnetry. The {{comparison of}} the porosimetric profiles between the carbon powder and the <b>catalyst</b> supported on carbon suggests that the loading of the <b>catalyst</b> onto the Vulcan XC- 72 carbon changes the porosimetry of the catalyst/carbon. The porosimetry of the <b>catalyst</b> layer depends on the <b>catalyst</b> used and the Nafion content.

5|$|Like all <b>catalysts,</b> enzymes {{increase}} the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. Some enzymes {{can make their}} conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other <b>catalysts</b> by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH.|$|E
