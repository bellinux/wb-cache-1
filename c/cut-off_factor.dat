The nondiagonal {{generalized}} vector dominance model (GVDM) of photoabsorption is elaborated using QCD-motivated {{picture of}} the γ− qqtransition and subsequent meson dominated scattering of the − qq-pair on the nucleon.

40|$|A new {{calculation}} {{is performed}} {{of the force}} between nucleons due to their participation in an exchange of π mesons. The approach is semi field theoretical, but one reduces the essentially relativistic scheme to the situation where one can place a potential function V in the two nucleon Schrödinger equation. In an adiabatic approximation one calculates the change in energy in the system due to the meson exchange activity between the two nucleons a fixed distance apart. When one allows the quasi-static nucleons to move by including Laplacian operators {{for them in the}} total Hamiltonian, a spin orbit potential emerges.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Isfahan, Iran with 637 elementary school-aged children. A semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire was used to assess usual dietary intakes. Data on socio-demographic, physical activity and other lifestyle habits were collected using standard questionnaires. Obesity was determined based on national <b>cut-offs.</b> <b>Factor</b> analysis was used for identifying major dietary patterns. Results: Three major dietary patterns were extracted; "Healthy," "Western," and "Sweet-Dairy. " After adjusting for confounders, girls in the second quartile of healthy pattern, were more likely to be overweight (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 23, Confidence intervals [CI] = 1. 003, 4. 96) compared to those in the highest quartile. Likelihood of being overweight was lower for girls in the second quartile of western dietary pattern versus the fourth quartile (OR = 0. 46, CI = 0. 21, 1. 01).

The likelihood is maximized for Ω_Λ= 0. 70 ± 0. 09 when considering the sample excluding the SLACS systems (known to be biased towards large image-separation lenses) and no-evolution, and Ω_Λ= 0. 81 ± 0. 05 when limiting to gravitational lenses with image separation larger than 2 " and no-evolution. In both cases, results accounting for galaxy evolution are consistent within 1 σ. The present test supports the accelerated expansion, by excluding the null-hypothesis (i. e., Ω_Λ = 0) at more than 4 σ, regardless of the chosen sample and assumptions on the galaxy evolution. A comparison between competitive world models is performed by means of the Bayesian information criterion. This shows that the simplest cosmological constant model - that has only one free parameter - is still preferred by the available data on the redshift distribution of gravitational lenses. We perform an analysis of the possible systematic effects, finding that the systematic errors due to sample incompleteness, galaxy evolution and model uncertainties approximately equal the statistical errors, with present-day data.

40|$|The Burgers vortex (Burgers 1948) is {{described}} by an exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in which the effects of uniform axisymmetric stretching are in equilibrium with viscous diffusion. Burgers introduced this vortex as ‘a mathematical model illustrating the theory of turbulence’, and he noted particularly that the vortex had the property {{that the rate of}} viscous dissipation per unit length of vortex was independent of viscosity in the limit of vanishing viscosity (i. e. high Reynolds number). This is of course an attractive feature in the light of Kolmogorov’s theory of turbulence, in which the rate of dissipation of energy per unit volume E and the kinematic viscosity U are regarded as independent variables. The idea that the small-scale structures of turbulence might be repre-sentable in terms of a random distribution of vortex sheets or tubes was taken up by Townsend (1951). Townsend showed that a random distribu-tion of vortex sheets would give rise to an energy spectrum proportional to k- 2 (multiplied by an exponential viscous <b>cut-off</b> <b>factor)</b> this power-law reflecting the fact that on any straight line through the field of turbulence, intersecting a finite number of vortex sheets, there will be (in the limit of vanishing viscosiby) a finite number of discontinuities of velocity per unit length. A random distribution of vortex tubes gave rise to a power-law k-’ (again modified by an exponential cut-off), this slower fall-off with k being associated with the more singular behaviour in physical space associated with a line vortex. The Kolmogorov spectrum k- 5 / 3 lies tantalisingly between k- l and k- 2, suggesting that the typical (or generic) structures in x-space which may be responsible for such a spectrum should involve some compromise between tubes and sheets, for example spiral structures (Lundgren 1982, Gilbert 1988), these possibly arising through the interaction of tubes and sheet...|$|E

Clustering analysis is the process of finding the groups of objects such that the objects in a group will be similar to one another and dissimilar from the objects in other groups. These groups are known as clusters.   In other words, clustering is the process of organizing the data objects in groups whose members have some similarity among them.

Those students did not major in English. The researchers used a Chinese version of the FLCAS with slight modifications and three additional questions and applied a factor analysis with varimax rotation. The Cronbach’s alpha was 0.92. Although they documented three underlying components—fear of negative evaluation, communication apprehension, and test anxiety—their analytical explanation seemed insufficient and inconsistent. For example, according to their description, the third factor named “Test anxiety” consisted of two items, Nos. 8 and 21; however, its factor loadings were 0.304 and[*]−[*] 0.126, respectively. Item No. 21 should have been eliminated due to its very low factor loading. Moreover, the second factor named “Communication apprehension” was composed of seven items (1, 9, 14, 18, 24, 27, and 32 in their study) whose factor loadings ranged from 0.094 to 0.611; however, the 0.611 of No. 14 as the highest score {{was not included in}} the column of the second factor but in that of the third factor of test anxiety. Accordingly, we reanalyzed factor loadings described in their study by using a <b>cut-off</b> <b>factor</b> loading of >[*] 0.30 because the sample size was greater than 500; we also eliminated items with a crossloading with >[*] 0.30 factor loading. As shown in Table 1, results of their study illustrated three factors in the 33 original questions: (1) the first factor with four items (3, 13, 19, and 31); (2) the second factor with three items (10, 25, and 30); and (3) the third factor with four items (2, 14, 18, and 32). When interpreting four constituent items of the first factor, the factor included the two constructs of communication apprehension (e.g., No. 3) and fear of negative evaluation (e.g., No. 19). The second factor was associated with test anxiety (e.g., No. 10). Similar to the third factor of Aida’s study, the third factor of the study of Liu and Jackson (2008) comprised all reversed items and seemed to be linked with communication apprehension with a positive attitude (e.g., No. 2). This suggests that even though several items were thought to conceptually include the same construct, students’ response to such items might be different depending on the positive or negative format of questions.

40|$|Rapid and {{luminous}} flares of non-thermal radiation {{observed in}} blazars require an efficient mechanism of energy dissipation and particle acceleration in relativistic active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets. Particle acceleration in relativistic magnetic reconnection is being actively studied by kinetic numerical simulations. Relativistic reconnection produces hard power-law electron energy distributions N (γ) ∝ γ − p exp (− γ / γ max) with index p → 1 and exponential <b>cut-off</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> γ max ∼ σ in {{the limit of}} magnetization σ = B 2 / (4 π w) ≫ 1 (where w is the relativistic enthalpy density). Reconnection in electron-proton plasma can additionally boost γ max by the mass ratio m p / m e. Hence, in order to accelerate particles to γ max ∼ 10 6 in the case of BL Lacs, reconnection should proceed in plasma of very high magnetization σ max ≳ 10 3. On the other hand, moderate mean jet magnetization values are required for magnetic bulk acceleration of relativistic jets, σ mean ∼ Γ j ≲ 20 (where Γ j is the jet bulk Lorentz factor). I propose that the systematic dependence of γ max on blazar luminosity class—the blazar sequence—may result from a systematic trend in σ max due to homogeneous loading of leptons by pair creation regulated by the energy density of high-energy external radiation fields. At the same time, relativistic AGN jets should be highly inhomogeneous due to filamentary loading of protons, which should determine the value of σ mean roughly independently of the blazar class...|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the modern design of the control {{circuits}} for digital potentiometers and their application in analog systems. The concept of the digital control is demonstrated on the electronically controlled active 2 -nd order filter and programmable oscillator. The proposed design of the active filter describes a programmable active 2 -nd order filter Sallen-Key. In this circuit it is possible independently programme <b>cut-off</b> frequency, Q <b>factor</b> and type of approximation with very good accuracy. The circuits of the designed filter and designed oscillator are simulated in PSpice (OrCAD), parasite effects and effects of the real parts are studied. Properties simulated circuits are compare with experimental results. These results appreciate quality and efficiency of the digitally controlled potentiometers in dependence on variable input circuit parameters. Integral part of this project is author’s universal control program called Digipot and comunications interface for many types of digital potentiometers with I 2 C, SPI or Up/Down interface. It is possible to use this device for many applications. The constructional details of the filter are presented {{at the end of}} this work.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: There {{are limited}} {{screening}} instruments for diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and none for quantifying {{the severity of}} disease. We aimed to validate a 13 -item self-reported RBD questionnaire (RBDQ-HK) for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. METHODS: Based on ICSD-II and our previous clinical and empirical work, the RBDQ-HK questionnaire was designed and administered in patients attending university-affiliated sleep clinic and psychiatric out-patient clinic, and subjects from the general population. ROC curve and exploratory factor analysis were employed to evaluate the scale, which had a score ranging from 0 to 100. RESULTS: One hundred and seven RBD patients [mean age 62. 6 (15. 5) years; male 70. 1 %] and 107 control subjects [mean age 55. 3 (9. 0) years, male 57. 9 %] completed the questionnaire. The diagnoses of all the study subjects were independently ascertained by clinical interview and PSG. RBD patients had a significantly higher total RBDQ-HK score [mean (s. d.) : 32. 1 (16. 1), range 3 - 71] {{than the control group}} [9. 5 (10. 2), range 0 - 55] (p< 0. 005). The RBDQ-HK demonstrated robust psychometric properties with moderate sensitivity (82. 2 %), specificity (86. 9 %), positive predictive value (PPV; 86. 3 %), and negative predictive value (NPV; 83. 0 %), high internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Exploratory factor analysis revealed two components (dream-related and behavioral factors) that corresponded to the essential clinical features of RBD. The best cut-off for total score (range 0 - 100) was at 18 / 19 and the best <b>cut-off</b> for <b>factor</b> 2 (behavioral factors including sleep talking, shouting, limb movements and sleep-related injuries, range 0 - 70) was at 7 / 8. CONCLUSIONS: The RBDQ-HK has satisfactory validity and reliability as a measure of clinical RBD symptoms and severity. It may serve as an effective tool for diagnosis and evaluation of the disease course to facilitate future clinical and research studies. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Iranian oil {{companies}} are developing the technique of Hydraulic Fracturing (HF) operation to enhance the hydrocarbon recovery of deep carbonate formations. However, {{there is not a}} computerized tool or well defined framework for Iranian carbonate oil fields to select candidates. The ineffective HF experiences in the past emphasized that candidate selection is the frontline of a victorious HF operation. This paper presents the development of a local programme to automatically select specific zones for special purposes like HF. The program is written in MATLAB in such a way to integrate large amount of data from different disciplines. In addition, the missing data are compensated with Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic techniques. In the end data are mechanically screened based on the user selected parameters, <b>cut-offs</b> and weight <b>factors.</b> Results of screening within the limitations are prioritized in stacked bars to make decision easier. This tool is applied for a purpose of candidate selection for HF in M oil field located in south of Iran. This field has 585 zones which each zone has more than 30 parameters form different disciplines. The result of this programming is printed schematically and it is conclusive to our clients. General Terms In this paper, a comprehensive algorithm for candidate selection is defined and a local multi screening program is introduced...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, for robust {{explanatory}} power, we {{stipulate that}} the extracted factors explain at least 50  % {{of the total}} cumulative variance. The oblique rotation is selected as it represents exploratory factoring more accurately than orthogonal rotation methods which are preferred when confirming models. To maintain statistical significance, variables with less than 0.55 coefficient loading (equal to 30.25  % of the variance {{accounted for by the}} <b>factor)</b> are suppressed. <b>Cut-off</b> criteria for <b>factor</b> loadings remain a matter of debate (Bowles 2006; Conway and Huffcutt 2003; Cudeck and O’Dell 1994). Hair et al. (1998) suggest that the factor loading can be smaller the larger the sample size and the larger the number of variables being analysed; and that the larger the number of factors, the larger should be the size of the loadings to maintain statistical significance. Shapiro et al. (2002) indicate several <b>factor</b> coefficient loading <b>cut-offs.</b> 12 Heuristics suggest that loadings higher than 0.30 are salient, and that cut-off selection between 0.30 and 0.60 (Bagozzi and Yi 1998; Swisher et al. 2004) is representative of factor analysis in empirical social science literature. Regarding the factor names, they are assigned based on the factor loading of the variables taking the higher loading variables into consideration, that is, variables that are most influenced by the underlying factor. Factor loadings point out the correlation between factors and variables, namely {{the extent to which the}} factors influence the variables, or phrased differently, the percentage of variation accounted for by factors.|$|R
