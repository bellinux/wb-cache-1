50|$|The names, numbers, and {{chapters}} of the Douay - Rheims Bible and the Challoner revision follow that of the Vulgate and therefore {{differ from those of}} the King James Version and its modern successors, making direct <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>versions</b> tricky in some places. For instance, the books called Ezra and Nehemiah in the King James Version are called 1 and 2 Esdras in the Douay - Rheims Bible. The books called 1 and 2 Esdras in the KJV are called 3 and 4 Esdras in the Douay, and were classed as apocrypha. A table illustrating the differences can be found here.|$|E

Successfulness of algorithm depends mainly on a selected set of features describing a context, which determines choice of a tag. The work describes briefly the algorithm and its implementation. Main {{part of the work}} consists of a lot of experiments which explore possible feature sets, their successfulness and their relationships. Few clear rules are defined for <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>versions.</b> Fivefold crossvalidation with t-test is used for verification of statistical significance. After the work was started, new Czech data became available, so all experiments used data from PDT 2. 0. Side effect of this work was statistical significant improvement of successfulness. However, the best Czech tagger was obviously not overwhelmed. Some modifications were made in order to perform automatic version development. It was executed in small extent and also described...|$|E

40|$|Classically {{difficult}} positioning environments {{have always}} called for some augmentation technology {{to assist the}} Global Positioning System (GPS). "Locata" offers augmentation, and even replacement, to GPS in such environments. However, like any other system relying on wireless technology, a Locata positioning network faces issues {{in the presence of}} RF interference (RFI). This problem magnifies due the fact that Locata operates in the licence-free 2. 4 GHz ISM band. WiFi devices operating in this band have been identified as the most likely potential interferer, due partially to their use of the whole ISM band. This paper evaluates the performance of Locata in the presence of WiFi interference. A <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>Version</b> 2 and Version 3 devices is presented. Evidently very significant advances and improvements have been made in Version 3 for rejecting RF interference (RFI). Test results presented in this paper give an insight into this situation.
