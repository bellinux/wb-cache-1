50|$|Color {{balancing}} {{an image}} affects {{not only the}} neutrals, but other colors as well. An image that is not color balanced {{is said to have}} a <b>color</b> <b>cast,</b> as everything in the image appears to have been shifted towards one color. Color balancing may be thought in terms of removing this <b>color</b> <b>cast.</b>|$|E

50|$|The D2H {{series has}} a {{relatively}} weak infrared (IR) filter, causing certain dark-colored fabrics {{to take on}} a slight magenta <b>color</b> <b>cast.</b> Skin tones may also appear slightly ruddy. Use of a No. 486 digital UV/IR blocking filter can help resolve the problem with lenses that are at least 50 mm or longer. Lenses shorter than 50 mm are not recommended for use with a No. 486 filter due to a tendency for the corners of the image {{to take on a}} cyan <b>color</b> <b>cast.</b>|$|E

50|$|Different {{algorithms}} {{exist that}} perform automatic color correction. The UCM (Unsupervised Color Correction Method), for example, does {{this in the}} following steps: It firstly reduces the <b>color</b> <b>cast</b> by equalizing the color values. Then it enhances contrast by stretching the red histogram towards the maximum and finally Saturation and Intensity components are optimized.|$|E

50|$|A 35mm Kodachrome transparency, {{like other}} 35mm {{transparencies}} on films of comparable ISO rating, contains {{an equivalent of}} approximately 140 megapixels of data in the 24 mm x 36 mm image. Scanning Kodachrome transparencies can be problematic because of the film's tendency to scan with a blue <b>color</b> <b>cast.</b> Some software producers deliver special Kodachrome color profiles with their software to avoid this. An IT8 calibration with a special Kodachrome calibration target is necessary for accurate color reproduction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{light from}} an {{incandescent}} source {{is similar in}} character to that from a Planckian [...] "black body" [...] in spectral distribution, that is, the bulb, as the filament heats up, produces light from wavelengths throughout the visible spectrum. Alternative light sources use phosphors or combinations of mono-chromatic LEDs (red, blue, green) to produce [...] "white" [...] light, giving significantly irregular spectral distributions which can result in <b>color</b> <b>casts</b> in photography and differences of color matching when compared to incandescent light or daylight.|$|R

In 2010, Coffin developed a library cataloguing system for the Library of the American Society for Psychical Research in New York City utilizing the <b>colors</b> <b>cast</b> on the library's shelves by the natural light passing through the library's Tiffany Stained Glass windows.|$|R
5000|$|The use of {{available}} light may pose {{a challenge for}} a photographer. The brightness {{and direction of the}} light is often not adjustable, except perhaps for indoor lighting. This will limit the selection of shutter speeds, and may require the use of shades or reflectors to manipulate the light. It can also influence the time, location, and even orientation of the photo shoot to obtain the desired lighting conditions. Available light can often also produce a <b>color</b> <b>cast</b> with color photography.|$|E
50|$|In practice, photographers {{almost always}} use {{relative}} or perceptual intent, as for natural images, absolute causes <b>color</b> <b>cast,</b> while saturation produces unnatural colors. Relative intent handles out-of-gamut by clipping (burning) these colors {{to the edge}} of the gamut, leaving in-gamut colors unchanged, while perceptual intent smoothly moves out-of-gamut colors into gamut, preserving gradations, but distorts in-gamut colors in the process. If an entire image is in-gamut, relative is perfect, but when there are out of gamut colors, which is more preferable depends on a case-by-case basis.|$|E
50|$|White fabrics {{acquire a}} slight <b>color</b> <b>cast</b> after use (usually grey or yellow). Since {{blue and yellow}} are {{complementary}} colors in the subtractive color model of color perception, adding a trace of blue color to the slightly off-white color of these fabrics makes them appear whiter. Laundry detergents may also use fluorescing agents to similar effect. Many white fabrics are blued during manufacturing. Bluing is not permanent and rinses out over time leaving dingy or yellowed whites. A commercial bluing product allows the consumer to add the bluing back into the fabric to restore whiteness.|$|E
50|$|The solar {{window is}} a gift given in August 1987 by Dr. and Mrs. William M. Staerkel in memory of their parents and {{as a tribute to}} the {{dedicated}} Parkland College faculty and staff. The solar window, created by artist Arthur Stern, is an abstract representation of the changing daily path of the sun across the sky, from June (top), when the sun is highest and daylight is longest, to December (bottom), when the sun is lowest and daylight is shortest, and back to June. When the sun shines through the window, embedded prisms split the sunlight into its component <b>colors</b> and <b>cast</b> small rainbow-like patterns called spectra inside the building. These spectral colors are repeated in the colors of the windows. As the rotation of the earth makes the sun appear to ravel in its daily arc, the patters of <b>colors</b> <b>cast</b> by the window and the prisms slowly changes position with the changing position of the sun.|$|R

Joining the cast for the third season was former Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star Alfonso Ribeiro as Dr. Maxwell [...] "Max" [...] Stanton and In Living <b>Color</b> <b>cast</b> member Kim Wayans as Tonia Harris. Both Maxwell and Tonia helped Marion manage the Los Angeles sports clinic he owns, then Tonia leaves after Season 4, and Tiffany leaves after only two episodes in Season 5.|$|E
50|$|Perceptual constancies are {{sources of}} illusions. Color {{constancy}} and brightness constancy {{are responsible for}} the fact that a familiar object will appear the same color regardless of the amount of light or color of light reflecting from it. An illusion of color or contrast difference can be created when the luminosity or color of the area surrounding an unfamiliar object is changed. The contrast of the object will appear darker against a black field that reflects less light compared to a white field even though the object itself did not change in color. Similarly, the eye will compensate for color contrast depending on the <b>color</b> <b>cast</b> of the surrounding area.|$|E
50|$|In Living <b>Color</b> <b>cast</b> member Tommy Davidson {{returned}} to Mad TV {{seven years after}} his first host appearance, this time playing a frequently featured character on Real Motherfucking Talk named Woogie Jones-Johnson. Another alumnus of the 90s sketch variety show, David Alan Grier, made an appearance as 60 Minutes anchor Ed Bradley. Comic actor Fred Willard appeared as recurring character Gene St. John, a movie critic who curses uncontrollably after each installment of Real Mother****ing Talk. That 70s Show Danny Masterson and Wilmer Valderrama returned for another parody of CHiPs with co-star Mila Kunis.

40|$|The {{influence}} of additives (sucrose, propylene glycol and soybean oil) and process parameters (pH and temperature), on bio-based cassava starch-gelatin films stability during storage {{have been evaluated}} by a 2 (7 - 3) factorial experiment design. X-ray diffractograms have indicated that only sucrose influenced film stability resulting in crystallization during storage (60 days), which was also observed by scanning electron and light microscopy images. Light micrographs, besides indicated sucrose crystallization, also allowed observing phase separation. All biofilm samples presented a high lightness and low redness and yellowness, indicating to be almost colorless. Although temperature did not influence film microstructure and <b>color,</b> <b>casting</b> temperature of 60 C had completely destroyed samples, {{and it has not}} been recommended for further investigations...|$|R
50|$|In practice, ND {{filters are}} not perfect, {{as they do}} not reduce the {{intensity}} of all wavelengths equally. This can sometimes create <b>color</b> <b>casts</b> in recorded images, particularly with inexpensive filters. More significantly, most ND filters are only specified over the visible region of the spectrum and do not proportionally block all wavelengths of ultraviolet or infrared radiation. This can be dangerous if using ND filters to view sources (such as the Sun or white-hot metal or glass), which emit intense invisible radiation, since the eye may be damaged even though the source does not look bright when viewed through the filter. Special filters must be used if such sources are to be safely viewed.|$|R
50|$|Natural and surreal {{are just}} {{different}} {{sides of the}} same cause and effect coin. Understanding what makes lighting seem natural makes it easier to understand how to create other desired reactions. Natural light usually comes from above, so strategies which place the key light below the face will appear to be unusual or unnatural. The brain adapts color perception in a way which makes color balance seem neutral on white clothing and faces. The eyes also adapt to brightness as they scan and usually perceive a full range of detail in most environments. Lighting a scene with a tonal range or <b>color</b> <b>cast</b> which is out of context with what would typically be expected will cause the viewer to notice the environment and make other than normal assumptions about it. It is also possible to create the impression of environmental context where none is seen in the photograph, such the look of a person standing under a streetlight at night by using a gridded flash attached to the ceiling of the studio with no fill source.|$|E
50|$|Before {{creating}} a digital negative {{it is important}} to know the process to which it will be applied. Since contemporary inks and printers cannot cover a gamut as wide as traditional silver negatives and it is imperative that each process have its own tonal curve to apply to a photograph so that the photographer can take full advantage of its gamut. Also, different processes react to colors in different ways; sometimes photographers print out a monochromatic negative in a specific color to get a specific contrast range. For example, some use purple inks and low contrast curves for the small gamut of cyanotype printing, while the platinum/palladium process necessitates a high contrast curve that works best with green ink. Before the <b>color</b> <b>cast</b> is added, however, {{it is important to}} remember to invert the image to ensure that the negative prints a positive if contact printing (some also flip their image horizontally since the final print will be a mirror image of the negative), or sometimes it may be left as a positive (in the case of a positive image on a dry or wet plate).|$|E
50|$|Photographic {{lenses and}} {{equipment}} are designed around {{the film to}} be used. Although the earliest photographic materials were sensitive only to the blue-violet end of the spectrum, partially color-corrected achromatic lenses were normally used, {{so that when the}} photographer brought the visually brightest yellow rays to a sharp focus, the visually dimmest but photographically most active violet rays would be correctly focused, too. The introduction of orthochromatic emulsions required the whole range of colors from yellow to blue to be brought to an adequate focus. Most plates and films described as orthochromatic or isochromatic were practically insensitive to red, so the correct focus of red light was unimportant; a red window could be used to view the frame numbers on the paper backing of roll film, as any red light which leaked around the backing would not fog the film; and red lighting could be used in darkrooms. With the introduction of panchromatic film the whole visible spectrum needed to be brought to an acceptably sharp focus. In all cases a <b>color</b> <b>cast</b> in the lens glass or faint colored reflections in the image were of no consequence as they would merely change the contrast a little. This was no longer acceptable when using color film. More highly corrected lenses for newer emulsions could be used with older emulsion types, but the converse was not true.|$|E
6000|$|We {{may also}} infer {{something}} of a man's character from the tone and sentiments of others towards him. Glass of a certain <b>color</b> <b>casts</b> on surrounding objects a reflection of its own hue, and so the tint of a man's character returns upon us in the habitual manner {{in which he is}} spoken of by those around him. The common mode of speaking of Shakspeare always savored of endearment. [...] "Gentle Will" [...] is an expression that seemed oftenest repeated.

A space transport crash-lands on a desert planet illuminated by three suns: , , and , which bathe it in constant daylight; the <b>colors</b> <b>cast</b> by the triple suns are effectively represented with tinted camera work by cinematographer David Eggby. The light is extinguished in a month-long eclipse that recurs every 22 years—and, coincidentally, shortly after the castaways planetfall—when flapping swarms of ravenous creatures emerge into the pitch dark to feed. The shipwreck survivors comprise the usual assortment of conflicted and conflicting characters, including Vin Diesel as the tough thug with a well-hidden heart of gold, who manages to bring {{at least a few}} of the others unscathed through the harrowing night.|$|R
40|$|White {{balance is}} a crucial step in the {{photographic}} pipeline. It ensures the proper rendition of images by eliminating <b>color</b> <b>casts</b> due to differing illuminants. Digital cameras and editing programs provide white balance tools that assume a single type of light per image, such as daylight. However, many photos are taken under mixed lighting. We propose a white balance technique for scenes with two light types that are specified by the user. This covers many typical situations involving indoor/outdoor or flash/ambient light mixtures. Since we work from a single image, the problem is highly underconstrained. Our method recovers a set of dominant material colors which allows us to estimate the local intensity mixture of the two light types. Using this mixture, we can neutralize the light colors and render visually pleasing images. Our method {{can also be used}} to achieve post-exposure relighting effects...|$|R
