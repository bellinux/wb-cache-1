Shows employ continuous live music, with performers rather than stagehands changing the props. After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s, Nouvelle Expérience was created – with the direction of Franco Dragone – which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990, but allowed it to <b>create</b> <b>new</b> shows.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sites were}} {{proposed}} {{as the main}} Expo grounds. One location that was considered was Mount Royal Park, {{to the north of}} the downtown core.

The choice overcame opposition from Montreal's surrounding municipalities, and also prevented land speculation.|$|E
5|$|The New Age {{has also}} been {{identified}} by various scholars of religion {{as part of the}} cultic milieu.

Temperatures have increased {{in the last century}} while the observed changes in precipitation are variable, with some areas receiving more and other areas less. These changes have impacted river flow, increased the frequency of extreme weather events, and led to the retreat of glaciers. Based on the projections for both precipitation and temperatures, these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and <b>create</b> <b>new</b> problems associated with climate change in the country.|$|E

5|$|As late {{as in the}} Tudor and Stuart {{periods in}} Britain, herbals often still {{classified}} plants {{in the same way}} as Dioscorides and other classical authors, not by their structure or apparent relatedness but by how they smelt and tasted, whether they were edible, and what medicinal uses they had. Only when European botanists like Matthias de l'Obel, Andrea Cesalpino and Augustus Quirinus Rivinus (Bachmann) had done their best to match plants they knew to those listed in Dioscorides did they go further and <b>create</b> <b>new</b> classification systems based on similarity of parts, whether leaves, fruits, or flowers.|$|E
5|$|Bowman {{argued that}} the {{authorized}} sale of the seeds extinguished the patent, and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo.

Collections of stories, such as Grimms' Fairy Tales or those by Hans Christian Andersen, have been similarly influential.

5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to <b>create</b> <b>new</b> ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E
