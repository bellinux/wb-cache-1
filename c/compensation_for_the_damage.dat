Although blackbuck cause a similar problem, {{the damage caused by}} them is significantly lower as they merely break off young shoots. A 1990 study suggested culling, building enclosures for the antelopes and fencing off agricultural areas as remedies for the menace.|$|E
5|$|In 1760, {{with the}} Seven Years' War raging, Euler's farm in Charlottenburg was ransacked by {{advancing}} Russian troops. Upon learning of this event, General Ivan Petrovich Saltykov paid <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> caused to Euler's estate, later Empress Elizabeth of Russia added a further payment of 4000 roubles – an exorbitant amount at the time. The {{political situation in}} Russia stabilized after Catherine the Great's accession to the throne, so in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation {{to return to the}} St. Petersburg Academy. His conditions were quite exorbitant – a 3000 ruble annual salary, a pension for his wife, and the promise of high-ranking appointments for his sons. All of these requests were granted. He spent {{the rest of his life}} in Russia. However, his second stay in the country was marred by tragedy. A fire in St. Petersburg in 1771 cost him his home, and almost his life. In 1773, he lost his wife Katharina after 40 years of marriage.|$|E

25|$|On 14 September 2008, the Arab League Ministerial Council {{passed a}} {{resolution}} calling for the 'political hostage' Megrahi {{to be released from}} prison in Scotland. The resolution demanded that the Scottish government should hand to Megrahi's lawyers the documents which the SCCRC had identified, adding that Britain's refusal to do so represented a 'miscarriage of justice'. The Arab League also endorsed Libya's right to <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> done to its economy by UN sanctions which were in force from 1991 until 1999.|$|E
25|$|In May 2010, the United States Department of the Interior {{called for}} an end to {{drilling}} in the area of the Deepwater Horizon spill. Despite pushback from oil companies and states, the Supreme Court ruled to keep the moratorium in place until October 2010. BP agreed to financial <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> they caused, including payouts to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust. Regulations drafted after the accident required oil companies to update their safety equipment, including blowout preventers. This measure was criticized as too costly to integrate and thus harmful to industry and job growth, so it has been weakly enforced.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{thanks to}} the {{importance}} of the French market to the Dutch, {{and the fact that the}} Dutch had less possibilities of imposing counter-pressure than they had in their conflicts with the English, the Dutch government at first tried to ignore the hostile policies of Colbert. Its inaction was also caused by differences of opinion about how best to proceed within the States Party. Amsterdam, and especially the Amsterdam diplomat Coenraad van Beuningen, argued in favor of firm economic counter-measures against the French economic policies, paired with the forming of a defensive alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. De Witt, however, preferred avoiding such foreign entanglements, and a conciliatory approach in the economic sphere. As their economic interests were severely damaged by the French protectionism, the industrial cities of Leiden and Haarlem, however, teamed up with Amsterdam to support a more belligerent diplomacy. After the Rotterdam regents were promised <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> to their wine trade, to get their assent, the States of Holland decided in 1671 on severe retaliatory measures against French imports, in effect banning French wine, vinegar, paper, and sail-canvas. The stage was now set for war.|$|E

25|$|Kafr Yasif was {{the site}} of the first major violent {{incident}} between Christians and Druze in Israel on 11 April 1981. The clash began during a football match between fans of the town's local team and that of the nearby Druze village of Julis where a young man from Julis was fatally stabbed by a Christian from Kafr Yasif. Although reconciliation talks were immediately arranged to prevent further violence, the local council of Kafr Yasif refused to give up the name of the alleged killer. Hundreds of Druze youths from Julis subsequently entered Kafr Yasif, prompting the mayor to call for emergency back-up from the regional Israeli Police, a request which was denied. On 13 April about 60 armed police officers positioned themselves in the field between the two villages, and while a sulha (traditional Arab peace agreement) was being negotiated, a group of heavily armed Julis residents stormed the town, burning down 85 houses, 17 stores, a few workshops and 31 cars. A church was also damaged. By the end of the attack three residents of Kafr Yasif were shot dead and more were wounded. The police did not intervene, with some officers claiming they were not sufficiently armed. None of the attackers, which according to witnesses included some off-duty Druze soldiers from the Israeli Army, were arrested. Most of the <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> came from the Muslim waqf of Israel and a smaller portion from the World Council of Churches.|$|E
500|$|The first attack, {{after the}} German ultimatum, {{was against the}} {{schooner}} Lock Ryan, returning to Arklow. She was strafed and bombed by three German aircraft. Fortunately Lock Ryans cargo of china clay absorbed the blast and although badly damaged, she survived. Germany acknowledged the attack but refused to pay <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> as she was in [...] "the blockaded area", [...] "through which the Irish had been offered free passage but on terms which were rejected". There were many attacks on ships on the cross-channel trade. In 1940 nine Irish ships were lost. That figure may be small compared with Allied losses, but it represents {{a larger proportion of}} the small Irish fleet.|$|E
500|$|Later {{on during}} {{the day of the}} altercation, the police {{collected}} Browne and Arnett from the AP bureau in Saigon and took the pair to what they described as a [...] "safe house". The police interrogators said that they would be arrested but were unspecific about the charges. One charge was that of assaulting two police officers, but the interrogators hinted that more serious offences such as organising illegal demonstrations were being considered. The officers conversed among themselves in French, a language which the reporters did not speak, but Arnett thought that they mentioned the word espionage. [...] After four hours of questioning, the pair were charged with assault. Browne and Arnett in turn filed charges against the police over the altercation, and demanded <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> to their photographic equipment. Arnett and Browne were temporarily released in the evening, after which the whole Saigon press corps stormed the US embassy.|$|E

2500|$|The Convention {{established}} the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).
