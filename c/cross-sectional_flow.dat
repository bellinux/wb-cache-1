This paper considers the effect of vegetation on <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> and bed shear distribution along a high-curvature bend. The analysis is conducted with the aid of data collected in a large-amplitude meandering flume during a reference experiment without vegetation and an experiment with vegetation on the bed. The results show that the presence of vegetation modifies the curvature-induced flow pattern and the directionality of turbulent structures. In fact, in the presence of vegetation, the turbulent structures tend to develop within and between the vegetated elements.

40|$|Abstract – The {{determination}} of hydraulic properties of open-channels and rivers {{is very important}} in water resources management and engineering. Geostatistical estimation methods in comparison with direct measurements and/or using mathematical models can be more cost and time effective. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the possibility of applying cokriging and residual kriging methods to estimate some hydraulic parameters of rivers or open-channels. The results indicate that cokriging can be used to estimate <b>flow</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> area, <b>flow</b> velocity and hydraulic radius, while residual kriging can be used to estimate <b>flow</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> area, <b>flow</b> velocity and water surface level elevation. It is concluded that water surface width is preferable to water depth as an auxiliary variable in the cokriging method. The relative error of estimation for geostatistical estimators was about 0. 87 to 22 %. Thus, these methods can be considered appropriate and the user’s expected accuracy is important in choosing the geostatistical estimators for estimation of hydraulic parameters in open-channels or rivers. In general, cokriging and residual kriging can be used to estimate open-channel hydraulic parameters by using 25 % (29 data) of measured data instead of 115 measured cross-sections along the channel or river with minimal cost and the least amount of time...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{defines the}} {{concepts}} of ecological flow velocity as well as ecological hydraulic radius (EHR) and proposes an ecological hydraulic radius approach (EHRA) which considers both the watercourse information (including hydraulic radius, roughness coefficient and hydraulic gradient) and the required stream velocity necessary for maintenance of certain ecological functions all together. The key parameter of EHRA is to fix the watercourse <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> area corresponding to EHR, by which the relation between parabola shaped <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> area and hydraulic radius is deduced. The EHRA not only meets the requirement of flow velocity for adequate fish spawning migration, but also is applicable to the ecological flows in regard with other ecological issues (such as the calculation of the instream flow requirements for transporting sediment and for pollution self-purification, etc.). This essay has illuminated the computational process taking the estimation of ecological water requirement of Zhuba Hydrological Station watercourse in Niqu branch of the Yalong River as an example. Additionally, we compare EHRA with Tennant approach. The result shows that the Zhuba Hydrological Station ecological water requirement calculated by EHRA lies between the minimum and favorable ecological water requirement calculated by the Tennant approach. This {{is due to the}} fact that the ecological flow velocity (such as the fish spawning migration flow velocity) was taken into consideration, producing results applicable to the practical situation...|$|E

40|$|Where rivers {{near the}} coastline, the {{receiving}} basin begins to influence flow, and gradually varied, nonuniform flow conditions arise. The {{section of the}} river affected by nonuniform flow is typically {{referred to as the}} backwater segment, and for large lowland rivers, this portion of the river can extend many hundreds of kilometers above the outlet. River morphology and kinematics vary in the backwater segment; however, these channel properties have not been explicitly related to properties of the flow and sediment-transport fields. This study examines the influence of spatially and temporally varying flow velocity and sediment transport on channel properties for the lower 800 km of the Mississippi River, a section of the river that includes the backwater segment. Survey transects (n = 2650) were used to constrain the cross-sectional area of water flow every ∼ 312 m along the Mississippi River channel for eight successive intervals of water discharge. Assuming conservation of water discharge, the local flow velocity was calculated at each transect by dividing water discharge by the local measurement of <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> area. Calculated flow velocity was converted to total bed stress using a dimensionless friction coefficient that was determined by optimizing the match between a predicted and a measured water-surface profile. Estimates for the skin-friction component of the total bed stress were produced from the values for total shear stress using a form-drag correction. These skin-friction bed-stress values were then used to model bed-material transport. Results demonstrate that in the lower Mississippi River, <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> area increases downstream during low- and moderate-water discharge. This generates a decrease in calculated water-flow velocity and bed-material transport. During high-water discharge, the trend is reversed: <b>Cross-sectional</b> <b>flow</b> area decreases downstream, producing an increase in calculated water-flow velocity and bed-material transport. An important contribution of this work is the identification of a downstream reversal in the trend for channel cross-sectional area due to variable water discharge. By accounting for the spatial divergences in sediment transport predicted over an average annual hydrograph, we demonstrate the tendency for channel-bed aggradation in much of the backwater reach of the Mississippi River (150 – 600 km above the outlet); however, a region of channel-bed erosion is calculated for the final 150 km. These results help to explain the spatial variability of channel morphology and kinematics for the lower Mississippi River, and they can be extended to other lowland river systems near the coastline...|$|E
