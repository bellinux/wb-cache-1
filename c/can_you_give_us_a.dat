5000|$|I was {{managing}} {{the band and}} we had no demo tape, we had no money, but we wanted to play a show. I was working at the bank and between wire transfers, I would be calling the Roxy. 'Hey, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> show, man? Eddie, give us a show.' He'd say, 'I need a demo tape, I can't just give you a show.' In five minutes, I'd call again. One day the Roxy just blew up and said, 'Fine! Go sell 75 tickets.' We sold 150.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not exactly, Jack! But {{we really}} have an object in coming here. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> ten minutes' talk, somewhere in private? We {{want to know about}} one of your patients." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not believe}} he has. But he is so {{slippery}} a customer he will swindle us if he <b>can.</b> Will <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> some advice how best to proceed? You know more about claims and legal papers than we do." ...|$|R

The product of all our ages (i.e. my age and the ages of my two brothers) is 144, {{assuming}} that we use whole numbers for our ages. Albert: We still don't know your age.

Bernard: Of course we know the bus number, but we still don't know your age. Cheryl: Oh, I forgot to tell you that my brothers have the same age. Albert and Bernard: Oh, now we know your age.|$|R

"The mate is good," [...] she said, [...] "and {{the bread}} tastes swate and refreshing, but wather is a blessed thing. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> no <b>give</b> <b>us</b> one dhrap of the wather that falls from heaven, Mr. Mulford; for this wather of the saa {{is of no}} use but to drown Christians in?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Can you {{conceive}} {{a position}} more terrible?' said Buckhurst. 'I declare I shall {{never forget it}} as long as I live. However, there was the Lock House at hand; and we got blankets and brandy. Coningsby was soon all right; but Millbank, I <b>can</b> tell <b>you,</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> some trouble.

6000|$|... "We are not {{a modest}} race ourselves," [...] she said, [...] "but I think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a lead. By the bye, were you playing golf with Senator Hamblin by {{accident}} the other afternoon?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish Violet {{could have}} come,' said Lord Martindale. 'I am glad <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a week; {{but it is}} a long time for her to be alone. I hope she has some friend to be with her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better. I {{came here to}} work, and I want to stick to it and not waste my time in parades and sentry duty. Well, we shall meet at the studio {{in the morning and}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> your news then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold your peace, my lad, {{while you}} are well," [...] said Bothwell; [...] "I promise you I think you are slyer than {{you would like to}} be supposed.--Come, good dame, you see your master will not believe that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> so bright a testimony." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of course we are most anxious to reach some place from which we can find a steamer or sailing vessel going to the United States.

6000|$|Pleasant indeed {{was that}} morn that dawned o'er the barroom at Angels, [...] Where in their manhood's prime was {{gathered}} {{the pride of}} the hamlet.

6000|$|... "In that case, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> {{no further}} information. Would you please {{remain in the}} room? Stand over there near the bedroom door. Now, Soames, I am {{going to ask you}} to have the great {{kindness}} to go up to the room of young Gilchrist, and to ask him to step down into yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Dick, {{you jump}} up behind me," [...] his father said. [...] "Dunlop <b>can</b> take <b>you,</b> Ned; and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a short {{account of what}} has befallen you as we ride back. We must get {{you a couple of}} horses of some kind or another at Synee. Can't you cast off these women's clothes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But,' {{said the}} townsmen, 'we {{have a great}} charge of poor upon our hands already, and we must {{take care not to}} {{increase}} it; we suppose <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> no security against your being chargeable to our parish and to the inhabitants, any more than <b>you</b> <b>can</b> of being dangerous to us as to the infection.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{would like}} to see you,” said a gentleman {{at the close of the}} engagement. “I belong across the river about ten miles north of here.

6000|$|... "Uncover, Caleb! uncover, for Heaven's sake!" [...] said Bucklaw; [...] "let <b>us</b> {{have what}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> without preface. Why, it stands well enough, man," [...] he continued, {{addressing}} impatiently the ancient butler, who, without reply, kept shifting the dish, {{until he had}} at length placed it with mathematical precision in the very midst of the table.|$|R
6000|$|Coming in {{to dress}} for dinner, I found a telegram: [...] "Mrs. Stormer dying; <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> half a column for to-morrow evening? Let her off easy, but not too easy." [...] I was late; I was in a hurry; I had very little time to think, but at a venture I {{dispatched}} a reply: [...] "Will do what I can." [...] It was not till I had dressed and was rolling away to dinner that, in the hansom, I bethought myself {{of the difficulty of}} the condition attached. The difficulty was not of course in letting her off easy but in qualifying that indulgence. [...] "I simply won't qualify it," [...] I said to myself. I didn't admire her, but I liked her, and I had known her so long that I almost felt heartless in sitting down at such an hour to a feast of indifference. I must have seemed abstracted, for the early years of my acquaintance with her came back to me. I spoke of her to the lady I had taken down, hut the lady I had taken down had never heard of Greville Fane. I tried my other neighbour, who pronounced her books [...] "too vile." [...] I had never thought them very good, but I should let her off easier than that.|$|R

"The plain is {{free from}} red-skins, to-night at least," [...] said Ishmael, after {{the bustle of}} {{reception}} had a little subsided; [...] "for I have scoured the prairie for many long miles, on my own feet, and I call myself a judge of the print of an Indian moccasin.

5000|$|Throughout December 2014, Banks {{released}} {{a series of}} videos in which she broke down tracks from Broke with Expensive Taste and revealed how each song came to be, dubbed the '16 Days of Azealia'. During the breakdown video for [...] "Chasing Time", Banks revealed that the song was conceived after the aforementioned occasion of her handing a completed version of the album in to her labels. In response to their request that Banks created something more current, she produced [...] "Chasing Time". This was further confirmed {{in an interview with}} Pitchfork Medias Jeremy Gordon, in which Banks said [...] "it got to a point where they were like, 'Azealia, we get it, you’re cool, but we've spent $2 million on this record, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> just <b>give</b> <b>us</b> one hit?' So then I did 'Chasing Time', and I was just like, 'You know, this isn't gonna work out.'" ...|$|R
