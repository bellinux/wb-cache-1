50|$|A fourth {{option that}} allows firms to fully {{control their own}} {{production}} and quality, {{to benefit from the}} experience of an organization that knows the local market, and which eliminates the need to make sizeable investments in physical and human assets is the manufacturing Shelter. Established in 1966, Cal Pacifico S.A. de C.V. was the second company to operate under the then new Maquiladora Program in Mexico and pioneered the shelter service provider model, providing those services to clients in that same year. The model proved so successful that later Cal Pacifico brought to Mexico to manufacture under the shelter operation method a long list of multinational manufacturers such as Asahi Overseas Corp., Bayer Corp., Eli Lilly & Co., 2 divisions of Emerson Electric Co., Esselte Pendaflex Corp., 2 divisions of General Dynamics Corp., Haemonetics Corp., 2 divisions of Hughes Corp., ITT General Controls, Medtronic, Inc., Northrop Grumman Corp., Pall Corp., Polk Audio, Inc., Scott USA, Smith Goggle Co., Sony Corporation of America, 7 divisions of Teledyne, Inc., The Carlyle Group, and Tyco, Inc. among others. Working through a shelter service provider, foreign-based manufacturers are able to initiate operations quickly without actually establishing a legal presence in the country. They are in Mexico as a department or subsidiary of their chosen shelter service provider. In essence, firms opting to use this vehicle are “sheltered” from many of the risks and liabilities that normally affect firms that choose to incorporate directly. Under the typical shelter arrangement, manufacturers send machinery & equipment, raw materials and supervisory personnel to train and manage workers, while the shelter service provider performs the tasks and functions that are not “core” to the manufacturing process. The manufacturer controls those areas that affect profitability and sustained growth. Shelter service providers typically offer their clients services in {{some or all of the}} following areas: human resources, payroll and benefits administration, logistics, import/export operations, accounting, taxation, legal, risk management, plant and park management, procurement, environmental, <b>customs</b> <b>compliance,</b> and real estate leasing. Those shelter services provide for the perfect match of offshore operational knowledge and manufacturing expertise... the technical support capabilities of the shelter service provider and the product manufacturing talents of its client(s).|$|E

40|$|<b>Customs</b> <b>compliance</b> {{concerns}} all international trading organizations importing or exporting goods over {{customs union}} borders. Each organization tends {{to deal with}} customs obligations differently: by setting up an internal business function dedicated to <b>customs</b> <b>compliance</b> and related processes (insourcing), by contracting a service company (outsourcing), or by purchasing an information technology (IT) solution. However, because businesses and their environments change, companies continuously need to adapt their customs business function to remain compliant. This dynamism combined with the ever increasing complexity of customs regulations creates a serious issue for international trading firms. Many companies struggle in finding {{the right way to}} implement their customs business function so that they can ensure compliance and operate efficiently. This thesis proposes a decision support model to assist international trading firms in deciding upon insourcing, outsourcing or automating their customs function. In doing so, decision factors have been collected at three case companies currently involved in aforementioned transformation process. Using qualitative content analysis and literature sources, factors have been categorized into situational, benefit, risk and cost factors. The McKinsey 7 S model has been used to structure the situational factors, resulting in a situational model. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) has been used to structure benefits, risks and costs into a decision support model. Combining both models, the resulting two-tier model can be used by international trading firms to chart their situational and stakeholder preferences and generate awareness of important decision factors...|$|E

However, determining the effectiveness of hip protectors has been hampered by unreliable compliance data. This study reports a reliable objective method of measuring compliance and the developed method could be used in any climate, regardless of temperature. <b>Custom</b> <b>compliance</b> monitors were built and embedded inside hip protectors. An algorithm was developed to utilize both temperature and acceleration to determine compliance. Seven young volunteers (age 24. 6 ± 4. 2 years old) wore the protectors for a total of 667 h while closely recording their compliance. One female (77 years old) who had hip fracture history wore the compliance monitors for 91. 6 % of the time during a 1 -week stay in a hospital. From the volunteers' trial, using temperature alone overpredicted compliance by 1. 2 % and using acceleration alone overpredicted by 5. 4 %, but using {{a combination of the two}} methods plus a correction factor only underestimated by 0. 6 %. From the elderly data, the average compliance recorded from the temperature, acceleration, and combined methods with correction was 94. 6, 88. 9, and 90. 2, respectively. The high accuracy of temperature sensors in this study will not be attainable in hot climates where most of the worldwide increase in hip fractures is occurring.

Fortunately, unlike many countries that find themselves at the mercy of international creditors, South Africa continues to enjoy a high degree of autonomy in determining and implementing our own socio-economic policy to best meet the needs of our people.

40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] India, a leading {{exporter}} of information-technology services, faces a fundamental puzzle. Its electronics industry is struggling despite a huge and growing domestic market and pockets of world-class capabilities. Drawing on survey questionnaires and interviews with key private and public industry players and multinationals, this study examines how restrictive regulations and a largely dysfunctional implementation of past support policies have constrained investment in plants and equipment and technology absorption and innovation. Electronics manufacturing remains disconnected from India’s chip-design capabilities which are integrated, instead, into global networks of innovation and production. India's growing domestic demand for electronic products results in rising imports of final products and high import-dependence for key components. Bold action is required to change the anemic growth of electronics manufacturing just when the global electronics industry is rapidly ending historical strategies for growth. To achieve its potential, electronics manufacturing in India must move beyond "high-volume, low-cost" activities, towards a greater focus on "low-volume, high-value" production and on frugal innovation for the domestic market. The government's National Policy on Electronics {{is a first step}} on this path, but it needs to be complemented by reforms relating to taxation, <b>customs,</b> <b>compliance,</b> and inspections. Equally important are efforts to enhance the strategic use of technical standards and smart approaches to international trade diplomacy...|$|E

South Africa's re-integration {{into the}} global trading economy and its {{participation}} in various trade agreements has resulted {{in an increase in}} the number of import and export transactions processed by the South African Revenue Services Customs Division. Importers and Exporters are expanding into new markets and regions, which require them to adhere to the legislative administrative requirements, enforced at the various designated Customs branch offices. To achieve <b>Customs</b> <b>compliance,</b> it is necessary that importers and exporters make the correct declaration to the SARS and make available the appropriate documentary information to support import and export transactions.

Then cast iron parts deburring is a hard task which requires extreme flexibility. For this reason industrial robots seem to be the ideal solution; unfortunately the long time needed for programming the robot and the manufacturing cycle, together with the parts variability and components range reduces heavily the overall manufacturing efficiency and profitability. For this reason, novel intelligent manufacturing methods must be realized and implemented. In the present paper it will be presented the integrated design and development of a new generation of cast iron parts robotic intelligent deburring and the engineering design methods adopted to achieve such results. The deburring of cast iron parts is performed by anthropomorphous robots with the integrated aid of vision systems, <b>custom</b> designed adaptive <b>compliance</b> tools and virtual prototypes of the cell itself, where it is possible to simulate all the different manufacturing tasks and automatically generate the code for the robotic cell numeric control.
