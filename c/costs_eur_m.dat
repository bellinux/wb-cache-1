The treated wastewater is to be reused for irrigated agriculture. Other projects approved around 2000 include a Water Loss Reduction project for Irbid and Jerash (<b>EUR</b> 18.2 <b>m</b> loan), a Water Loss Reduction project for the Northern Governorates (<b>EUR</b> 21.7 <b>m</b> loan and <b>EUR</b> 3.5 <b>m</b> grant), a Water Loss Reduction project in Karak (<b>EUR</b> 16.2 <b>m</b> loan and <b>EUR</b> 2.24 <b>m</b> grant) and a sanitation project in Karak and Kofranjah (EUR 15m loan and EUR 1.45m in grants). In 2006, KfW approved another series of loans, including for a third project supporting the reduction of distribution losses in Amman in partnership with other donors through a 11m Euro loan with the objective of saving 2.5 million m3 of water per year, enough to provide 70,000 beneficiaries with water. Other projects approved around 2006 include a project for water transmission in the Northern Governorates (<b>EUR</b> 15 <b>m</b> loan) and a project for water management in the Middle Governorates (<b>EUR</b> 5.3 <b>m</b> loan). In 2009, KfW modified its cooperation with Jordan from a project approach to a program approach, bundling its new funding in a single [...] "Water Resources Management Program" [...] (2009–2014) that covers water loss reduction, sanitation and the use of reclaimed water from Irbid for irrigation in the Northern Jordan Valley.

40|$|Background The {{costs and}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of treatment of thoracolumbar fractures are poorly known. Methods We estimated {{the costs of}} hospital care and outpatient visits for patients with traumatic thoracolumbar spine fractures. Results Stable fractures without neurological deficits were treated nonoperatively and the <b>costs</b> were <b>EUR</b> 5, 100. Unstable fractures without neurological deficits were treated either nonoperatively, {{with an average of}} 29 hospitalization days and average <b>cost</b> of <b>EUR</b> 12, 500 (86 % of which represented hospitalization costs), or operatively with 24 hospitalization days and average <b>cost</b> of <b>EUR</b> 19, 700 (48 % of which represented hospitalization costs and 42 % surgery costs). Unstable fractures with neurological deficits were usually operated (average <b>costs</b> <b>EUR</b> 31, 900). Interpretation For all patients, the costs of hospitalization days were the main cost driver. Although the length of stay for patients with unstable fractures and without neurological deficit who were treated operatively was shorter than for patients treated nonoperatively, the total costs were higher due to the additional costs of surgery. Surgical treatment must therefore be shown to give a better outcome in order to outweigh the costs. Future research should focus on the cost-effectiveness of operative and nonoperative treatment of patients with unstable vertebral fractures who have no neurological deficits, and take indirect costs and quality of life into accoun...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Two {{modes of}} public funding of {{research}} and development are examined: namely indirect tax incentives and direct subsidies to private sector firms carrying out R&D. As well as considering the arguments concerning claimed advantages and disadvantages of these policy instruments, attention is paid to international experience of the effectiveness of each approach. In particular, insights are gained from a review of empirical studies of input-additionality, i. e. when public R&D spending leads to an increase of private investment. A macro-level study from the OECD presents a suitable state-of-the-art approach for comparing additionality generated by the two kinds of funding instruments. Additionality is implied in both cases, 70 percent for direct grants etc. and 32 percent for the indirect effects of tax incentives. Using these estimates the worth of long-term extra spending in Austria is around <b>EUR</b> 120 <b>m</b> for direct, and <b>EUR</b> 100 <b>m</b> for indirect R&D support. ...|$|R
