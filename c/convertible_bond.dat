40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether {{companies}} engage in earnings management during the specific years when <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> are issued and redeemed; also to determine if any differences exist in earnings management when <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> are issued domestically or abroad. Design/methodology/approach – Discretionary current accruals are adopted as proxies for earnings management and the regression models are used to control the related variables. Findings – The empirical results indicate that companies conduct earnings management in the years when <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> are issued, and that there is no significant difference between earnings management when <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> are issued in Taiwan or abroad. However, data after 2001 indicate that companies issuing <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> abroad perform less earnings management compared to those issuing <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> domestically. The results show no significant difference in earnings management in the years when <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> are redeemed; the reasons may be due to the relatively small sample size and that the majority of <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> are still outstanding. Originality/value – This paper advances findings from previous studies, that firms conducting seasoned equity offerings manage earnings upward to increase the offering proceeds. This paper highlights the linkage between <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> and earnings management. Conducting an integrated analysis of the relationship between <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> and earnings management, it aims to provide a better understanding of the process. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the main results of the literature on pricing <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds.</b> It covers simple <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> which are non-callable and can be converted only at maturity as well as more complicated callable and puttable <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> under stochastic interest rates. The paper also reviews the main results in the literature on why firms issue <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds.</b> The two most often cited rationales for issuing <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> - as delayed equity, and to sweeten debt - are discussed in the context of both asymmetric information and agency models of capital structure. Finally, the paper provides some thoughts on incorporating strategic issues into the pricing of <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds.</b> risky/risk-free assets, call and put features, debt pricing, convertible debt, adverse selection, moral hazard,...|$|R

25|$|Convertible {{bonds are}} safer than {{preferred}} or common shares for the investor. They provide asset protection, because {{the value of}} the <b>convertible</b> <b>bond</b> will only fall to {{the value of the}} bond floor: however in reality if stock price falls too much the credit spread will increase and the price of the bond will go below the bond floor. At the same time, convertible bonds can provide the possibility of high equity-like returns.|$|E
25|$|Exchangeable bond: <b>Convertible</b> <b>bond</b> {{where the}} issuing {{company and the}} {{underlying}} stock company are different companies (e.g. XS0882243453, GBL into GDF Suez).

In 1986, Griffin started to invest during his freshman year at Harvard University after reading a Forbes magazine article. During his second year at Harvard, he started a hedge fund focused on <b>convertible</b> <b>bond</b> arbitrage. The fund was capitalized with $265,000 from friends and family, including money from his grandmother. He installed a satellite link to his dorm to acquire real-time market data. The investment strategy helped preserve capital during {{the stock market crash}} of 1987. Griffin's early success enabled him to launch a second fund, and between the two funds he was managing just over $1million. Griffin graduated from Harvard in 1989 with a degree in economics.|$|E

25|$|To {{determine}} a bond's rating, a credit rating agency analyzes {{the accounts of}} the issuer and the legal agreements attached to the bond to produce what is effectively a forecast of the bond's chance of default, expected loss, or a similar metric. The metrics vary somewhat between the agencies. S's ratings reflect default probability, while ratings by Moody's reflect expected investor losses {{in the case of}} default. For corporate obligations, Fitch's ratings incorporate a measure of investor loss in the event of default, but its ratings on structured, project, and public finance obligations narrowly measure default risk. The process and criteria for rating a <b>convertible</b> <b>bond</b> are similar, although different enough that bonds and convertible bonds issued by the same entity may still receive different ratings. Some bank loans may receive ratings to assist in wider syndication and attract institutional investors.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to test whether callable <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> are designed in response to costly debt- and equity¬related financing problems. We identify the design (debt-, mixed- and equity-like) of callable <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> using a measure of conversion probability which accounts for callability. Indeed, most of the existing empirical financial literature on convertible debt design does not pay much attention to the call feature in spite of its important repercussions on the security design. The empirical study provides evidence from 213 French callable <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> over the period 1990 - 2010 that the issuer features, and hence the offering motives vary with the design of callable convertible debt...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} three aspects of <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> {{financing}} using a Western European sample between 1994 and 2016. The first {{study of this}} thesis {{is related to the}} shareholder wealth effects at the announcement of the <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> issuance during financial crises. We find that the market reaction is more negative during crises’ periods compared to that in normal periods. Analysis of the determinant of this reaction indicates that the market recognizes the potential of <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> to reduce agency and adverse selection costs. However, we also find that the signal of overvaluation sent by the issuance mitigates the investors’ optimism about the ability of the <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> to alleviate external financing costs and this bad signal is exacerbated during the financial crises. Furthermore, we find that firms that are short-sale constrained incur less negative market reaction. The second study tests the sequential financing theory of Mayers (1998) which supports that firms issue callable <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> in order to implement optimal sequential financing strategy. We point out in this study the importance of the call provision by comparing the investment and financing activities of Western European firms that early called their <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> to those in the same industry that redeemed their bonds at maturity. We find that the inclusion of such provision allows firms (callable <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> issuers) to better control issuance costs and signals a “strong” sequential financing strategy. We also find that the calling firms invest more than the non-calling firms at the call date and the difference-in-differences model shows that this difference is due to the call decision, after controlling for time fixed effects and other control variables. The last chapter of this thesis addresses the issue of <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> call delay. As previous studies, we find that the companies do not call their bond at the optimum point identified by Ingersoll (1977). Unlike previous researches in the same area, our study considers the main theoretical rationales for <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> call delay. We find strong evidence for the financial distress hypothesis, little evidence for cash flow advantage and signaling theories but no evidence for the notice period justification...|$|R

2500|$|To {{compensate}} for having additional value through {{the option to}} convert the bond to stock, a <b>convertible</b> <b>bond</b> typically has a coupon rate {{lower than that of}} similar, non-convertible debt.
