40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{allowable}} costs for a residential PV/T liquid collector system {{with those of}} both PV-only and side-by-side PV and thermal collector systems. Four types of conventional energy systems provide backup: all oil, all gas, all electric resistance, and electric resistance hot water with space heating by parallel heat pump. Electric space cooling is modeled, and the electric utility serves as backup for all electrical needs. The analysis is separated into two parts. The first is a base case study using conservative market and financial parameters for comparing PV/T economics in three northern locations: Boston, Madison, and Omaha. All parameter estimates are for a privately purch. -sed residence, newly constructed in 1986. Three measures are used for establishing allowable costs, including system breakeven capital cost, al. owable levelized annual costs, and an allowable <b>combined</b> <b>collector</b> cost when compared directly with a side-by-side collector system. In the second portion of this study we examine the sensitivity of PV/T economics to pertinent physical, market, and financial variables.

40|$|Bibliography: p. 149 - 160. The {{collection}} efficiency of quartz particles in four different particle-bubble contacting environments was investigated during this thesis. Flotation experiments {{were carried out}} in a hybrid flotation column that could be modified into three different cell configurations (a quiescent column cell, an agitated column cell and a Jameson-type cell), while the fourth cell environment comprised a laboratory batch subaeration flotation cell. High purity quartz {{was used as a}} probe ore in conjunction with a cationic collector and a commercial frother blend. The quartz was initially contaminated with organic material and needed to be cleaned by calcination. The cleaned quartz was divided into four narrow particle size fractions to determine the effect of particle size on particle {{collection efficiency}}. The quartz was floated over a wide range of collector dosages and frother dosage was kept constant during experiments. The flotation was conducted using tap water at neutral pH. Froth depth was kept shallow during all experiments in the hybrid column cell configurations to enable the investigation to focus specifically on the collection zone. The effect of contacting environment (cell type) on particle collection efficiency was investigated by considering the effect of particle hydrophobicity, particle size and agitation speed (turbulence) on flotation recovery in the different cell types. The unique particle-bubble contacting environments resulted in different particle collection efficiencies and it was found that increased contacting intensity generally led to increased efficiency of collection. Increased particle hydrophobicity generally resulted in increased particle collection efficiency, although the overdosing of collector led to decreased flotation recovery which was probably caused by <b>combined</b> <b>collector</b> double layer and flocculation effects. The effect of particle size on flotation recovery exhibited classical n-curve behaviour at intermediate collector dosages and the optimum particle size range as reported in the literature was confirmed. Intense contacting between particles and bubbles followed by relatively quiescent disengagement (such as the mechanism employed in the Jameson cell configuration) proved to be beneficial to collection of both fine and coarse particles...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe complex disseminated {{relationship}} between pyrrhotite and magnetite {{as well as}} poor liberation of finely disseminated sulfurous pyrrhotite was revealed through the mineralogy investigation of certain high-sulfurous iron ore. Grinding process and fineness have been found as significant factors influencing the flotation desulfurization performance of high-sulfurous iron ore. Moreover, the separation tests of multi-stage grinding as well as direct one-stage fine grinding were conducted. The results show that desulfurization effect of the former is much better {{in comparison with the}} latter. For one thing, sliming losses and slime influences on the separation process were relieved when the separation process of multi-stage grinding was adopted. For another, the grinding circulating load was effectively reduced while the number of high quality particles was increased, which benefits the liberation of valuable minerals. In conclusion, a technological flowsheet was presented. As a first step, one-stage low intensity magnetic separation of mineral particles to produce rough concentrate of magnetic iron was applied under the condition of grinding fineness 65 % - 0. 074 mm. The next step was a fine regrinding of the obtained rough concentrate to 90 % - 0. 045 mm. In succession, an activation of ore pulp with combined activators, as well as a reverse flotation of pyrrhotite with <b>combined</b> <b>collectors</b> to produce magnetite concentrate was employed. The reverse flotation consisted of one-stage roughing, three stages of cleaning and one-stage scavenging. Lastly, another low intensity magnetic separation step on the obtained magnetite concentrate was applied to produce the final iron concentrate.
