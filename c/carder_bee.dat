25|$|In zoology {{the term}} {{polygyny}} {{is used for}} to a pattern of mating in which a male animal {{has more than one}} female mate in a breeding season. Males get their mates by defending the females directly or holding resources that the females want and need. This is known as resource defense polygyny and males of the bee species Anthidium manicatum (also known as the European wool <b>carder</b> <b>bee)</b> exhibit this behavior. Males claim patches of floral plants, ward off conspecific males and other resource competitors, and mate with the multiple females who forage in their territories. Males of many species attract females to their territory by either gathering in a lek or going out in search of dispersed females. In polygyny relationships in animals, the female is the one who provides most of the parental care for the offspring.|$|E
25|$|Developments in the 20th {{century have}} {{produced}} a marked contrast between the environments {{in the east and}} west of the island. The eastern half of the island is allocated to residential areas, the main public amenities and a small holiday camp and seafront, while the western half of the island is mainly farmland, marshes and industrial areas. The marshes in the west include the 30 hectares known as West Canvey marshes, acquired by the RSPB in 2007, and the Canvey Wick nature reserve. Canvey Wick is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) {{at the site of the}} abandoned and incomplete oil refinery. The foundations of the 100 hectare (0.4 sq mile) site were prepared in the 1970s by laying thousands of tonnes of silt dredged from the Thames; the abandoned and undisturbed area has flourished as a haven for around 1,300 species of wildlife, many of which are endangered or were thought to be extinct; including the shrill <b>carder</b> <b>bee,</b> the emerald damselfly and the weevil hunting wasp.|$|E

[...] In 2009 and 2010, the Trust attempted to reintroduce the short-haired bumblebee, Bombus subterraneus, which had become extinct in Britain, from the British-derived populations surviving in New Zealand from their introduction there a century earlier. From 2011 the Trust, in partnership with Natural England, Hymettus and the RSPB, has reintroduced short-haired bumblebee queens from Skåne in southern Sweden to restored flower-rich meadows at Dungeness in Kent.

Agri-environment schemes spread across the neighbouring area of Romney Marsh {{have been set up}} to provide over 800 hectares of additional flower-rich habitat for the bees.

50|$|In many species, {{the animal}} {{switches}} from nocturnal to diurnal foraging {{depending on the}} environmental temperature. This allows the individual to maximize its feeding efficiency during the warmer summer and lower its risk of predation during the winter.

50|$|The brown-banded <b>carder</b> <b>bee</b> favours vast grasslands. In Central Asia, {{it is an}} alpine species, {{living at}} altitudes of 3000 - 3900 m. Among the plants visited are Trifolium pratense (red clover), Centaurea (knapweed) and Vicia (vetches).|$|E
50|$|The common <b>carder</b> <b>bee</b> is polyectic, {{feeding on}} a variety of wild flowers, {{including}} nettles (Urticaceae), genuine motherwort (Lamiaceae), Himalayan balsam (Balsaminaceae), cabbage thistle, knapweed (Asteraceae), vetches, red and white clover (Fabaceae), monkshood (Ranunculaceae), fruit trees, etc.|$|E
50|$|Trichomes are an {{essential}} part of nest building for the European wool <b>carder</b> <b>bee</b> (Anthidium manicatum). This bee species incorporates trichomes into their nests by scraping them off of plants and using them as a lining for their nest cavities.|$|E
5000|$|The thorax of {{the common}} <b>carder</b> <b>bee</b> is either {{yellowish}} or reddish-brown in color. The hair of the first four abdominal segments are gray in color, while the hair of the fifth and sixth terga are yellowish or reddish-brown in color.|$|E
50|$|Its main hosts are {{bumblebees}} of the subgenus Thoracobombus such as Bombus pascuorum (common <b>carder</b> <b>bee).</b> In continental Europe, it also parasitizes nests of brown-banded carder bees (Bombus humilis) {{and early}} bumblebees (Bombus pratorum; although {{the latter is}} a Pyrobombus, not a Thoracobombus).|$|E

50|$|Bombus muscorum, {{commonly}} known as the large <b>carder</b> <b>bee</b> or moss <b>carder</b> <b>bee,</b> is a species of bumblebee in the family Apidae. The species is found throughout Eurasia in fragmented populations, but is most commonly found in the British Isles. B. muscorum is a eusocial insect. The queen is monandrous, mating with only one male after leaving a mature nest to found its own. Males mate territorially and the species is susceptible to inbreeding and bottlenecks. The species builds its nests on or just under the ground in open grassland and forages very close to the nest. In recent years, populations have significantly declined due to loss of natural habitat. B. muscorum is currently listed as vulnerable in Europe by the European Red List of Bees.|$|E
50|$|Pollination {{of autumn}} lady's tresses is little observed. In the Netherlands the common <b>carder</b> <b>bee</b> Bombus pascuorum and red-tailed {{bumblebee}} Bombus lapidarius are regular visitors. In southern France (Rhône Department) the honeybee also pollinates. The silver Y Autographa gamma is also seen to visits the flowers, but attached pollinia {{have not been}} observed.|$|E
50|$|Stachys {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the moths Coleophora auricella, C. lineolea, and C. wockeella, all recorded on S. officinalis. They are also widely used by the European wool <b>carder</b> <b>bee</b> (Anthidium manicatum), which scrape the hairs from the plant {{in order to use}} them for building their nests.|$|E
50|$|The brown-banded <b>carder</b> <b>bee</b> is {{threatened}} by habitat loss due to intensive farming. As Goulson, Hanley, Darvill, Ellis, and Knight have pointed out, a contributing factor {{in the northern part}} of its distribution (including Britain) is that B. humilis, being near the edge of its latitudinal range, is not well adapted to local conditions, so is sensitive to habitat changes, especially loss of unimproved grassland meadows.|$|E
5000|$|Bombus pascuorum, {{the common}} <b>carder</b> <b>bee,</b> is {{a species of}} {{bumblebee}} present in most of Europe {{in a wide variety}} of habitats such as meadows, pastures, waste ground, ditches and s, roads, and field margins, as well as gardens and parks in urban areas and forests and forest edges. It is similar in appearance to Bombus muscorum, and is replacing the species in Northern Britain.|$|E
5000|$|The head of {{the common}} <b>carder</b> <b>bee</b> is of medium length and the snout is long {{compared}} to other species of bumblebee. The snout of the queen ranges between 13 and 15 mm (.51 to [...]59 in) in length. The snout of workers range from 12 to 13 mm (.47 and [...]51 in) in length. The snout of drones range from 10 to 11 mm (.39 to [...]43 in) in length.|$|E
50|$|The bee fauna is {{particularly}} rich in species which depend on chalk grassland. One {{of only two}} British populations of the endangered (RDB) mining bee Melitta dimidiata is present on the plain, and two other RDB species which occur are Andrena hattorfiana and its nest parasite the cuckoo bee Nomada armata. This is a rare inland site for the nationally scarce brown-banded <b>carder</b> <b>bee</b> (Bombus humilis), and the only lowland English site for the broken-belted bumblebee (Bombus soroeensis).|$|E
5000|$|B. muscorum {{build its}} nest on or {{just under the}} ground. It cards {{together}} collected moss and dry grass to cover the nest. It is this behavior that gives B. muscorum the name moss <b>carder</b> <b>bee.</b> [...] It rarely, if ever, crosses sea barriers greater than 10 km to establish a nesting site. Once a nest is established, the bee is notoriously aggressive, readily attacking intruders that are {{too close to the}} nest, which they bite and sting simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|North America {{has many}} native megachilid species, but alfalfa leafcutter bees (Megachile rotundata) are an {{imported}} species used for pollination. The most significant native species is Osmia lignaria (the orchard mason bee or blue orchard bee), which is sold commercially {{for use in}} orchard crop pollination, and which can be attracted to nest in wooden blocks with holes drilled in them (which are also sold commercially for this purpose). Anthidium manicatum, {{also known as the}} European wool <b>carder</b> <b>bee,</b> is another species within the Megachilidae family. Rather than cutting leaves or petals, however, A. manicatum scrapes the hairs from leaves to use for nesting material, a behavior that is atypical in Megachilidae bees.|$|E
