Increasing levels of monolithic {{building in the}} Russian construction sector and construction equipment manufacturing automobile concrete pumps, stationary concrete pumps and pneumatic blower promote the use of high-performance, cost-based ways {{to the construction of}} monolithic concrete and reinforced concrete structures. Special concreting methods, including the method of discharge concrete using concrete pumps, stationary concrete pumps, pneumatic blower, switch arrows and mechanical concrete distributor, found a good use in the foreign and Russian construction practice. The method of concreting pressure scientifically sound and environmentally feasible for the construction of monolithic construction of foundations, including, for the monolithic structures erected by way of the "wall in the ground " [1, 4]. One of the ways to improve the efficiency of concrete-pumping is the concentration of the means of transport and production specialization. Organizational and technical system that combines concrete transportation and <b>concrete</b> <b>placer</b> technique has been implemented in the last century i...|$|E
