40|$|Most {{thermal spring}} {{discharges}} of Rajasthan and Gujarat in northwestern India have been sampled and analysed for major and trace elements {{in both the}} liquid and associated gas phase, and for O- 18 /O- 16, D/H (in water), He- 3 /He- 4 and C- 13 /C- 12 in CO 2 (in gas) isotopic ratios. Most thermal springs in Rajasthan are tightly associated to the several regional NE-SW strike-slip faults bordering NE-SW ridges formed by Archaean rocks at the contact with Quaternary alluvial and aeolian sedimentary deposits of the Rajasthan desert. Their Ca-HCO 3 immature character and isotopic composition reveals: (1) meteoric origin, (2) relatively shallow circulation inside the crystalline Archaean formations, (3) very fast rise along faults, and (4) deep storage temperatures of the same order of magnitude as discharging temperatures (50 - 90 degreesC). Thermal spring discharges in Gujarat are spread over a larger area than in Rajasthan and are associated both with the NNW-SSE fault systems bordering the Cambay basin and the ENE-WSW strike-slip fault systems in the Saurashtra province, west of the Cambay basin. Chemical and isotopic compositions of springs in both areas suggest a meteoric origin of deep thermal waters. They mix with fresh or fossil seawater entering the thermal paths of the spring systems through both the fault systems bordering the Cambay basin, as well as faults and fractures occurring inside the permeable Deccan Basalt Trap in the Saurashtra province. The associated gas phase, at all sampled sites, shows similar features: (1) it {{is dominated by the}} presence of atmospheric components (N- 2 and Ar), (2) it has high crustal He- 4 enrichment, (3) it shows crustal He- 3 /He- 4 signature, (4) it has low CO 2 concentration, and (5) the only analysed sample for C- 13 /C- 12 isotopic ratio in CO 2 suggests that CO 2 has a strong, isotopically light organic imprint.

Aquifer and bore penetration depth decrease between Birdsville and Marree from 1220 m to 170 m. A corresponding decrease in measured emergence temperature is also observed (94 - 31 °C). Chalcedony geotemperature estimates ranging from 110 °C to 41 °C between Birdsville and Marree are considered the most accurate of the various geothermometers tested. Log(Q/K) versus T diagrams have also been evaluated to determine likely aquifer mineral assemblages and reservoir temperatures (111 - 39 °C). The Birdsville Track Ridge acts as a conduit for low salinity groundwater (total dissolved solids range from 640 mg/l at Birdsville to 1900 mg/l at Marree) in the Great Artesian Basin. Old, slowly migrating groundwater from the deeper basins {{on either side of the}} ridge is characterised by higher emergence temperature and higher total dissolved solids. This old groundwater is inferred to have mixed with the younger, lower temperature, lower salinity groundwater that is migrating relatively rapidly along the Birdsville Track Ridge axis.

The power plant scenario has been changed to reflect the fact that the resource temperature may not be as high as that originally assumed in the Phase I study, the location of the production wells will in all likelihood be farther from the existing Air Force facilities [...] either north of Grazing Valley or south of Traveller's Hill [...] and the demand for power has increased which results in a more efficient utilization of the geothermal resource. The power plant concept chosen is similar to that used for Phase I in that small, modular, skid-mounted, factory assembled and tested, units are used to supply the power and potable water...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study {{compares the}} fluid geochemical {{signatures}} between the hydrothermal areas of Bouillante and Soufrière, obtained from our geochemical data and numerous existing literature works. The thermal springs {{emerging from the}} Bouillante area {{can be divided into}} two groups following their salinity and chemistry: - the first group is constituted of Na-HCO 3 waters with low salinities (< 1 g/l) and emergence temperatures (< 40 °C), which would be warmed in relatively superficial low temperature aquifers (< 80 °C) by thermal conduction; - the second group is represented by Na-Cl waters, with salinities higher than 1 g/l and partially constituted of the deep geothermal fluid. This Na-Cl fluid which can be collected from the geothermal production wells has salinity close to 20 g/l and results from a mixing of 58 % of seawater and 42 % of freshwater reacting with volcanic rocks at temperatures close to 260 °C. The fumaroles located in this area are associated with this geothermal fluid. According to the deltaD and delta 18 O values, their water steam would result from vaporization at 100 °C of a mixing of this fluid with surface cold freshwater. The chemical composition of their non-condensable gases (preponderance of CO 2, when the air contribution is low) is in agreement with this assumption. The thermal springs located around the Soufrière volcano discharge low salinity (< 2 g/l) waters with different chemical compositions and for which the <b>chemical</b> <b>geothermometers</b> indicate no deep temperature higher than 90 °C. Most of these waters would be meteoric waters warmed by magmatic gas escapes from the volcano. The fumaroles located in this area discharge high flux of HCl-rich water vapor and low volumes of non-condensable gases (< 7 %). These gases, mainly constituted of CO 2 (60 - 90 vol. %) and H 2 S (31 - 4 vol. %), have magmatic chemical and isotopic signatures much more marked than those of the Bouillante geothermal gases, less abundant and acid, of mixed origin. Indeed, for the first gases, 3 He/ 4 He ratio is 7. 9 to 8. 4 times higher than the atmospheric ratio and delta 13 C values range from - 3. 2 to - 3. 0 ‰, whereas for the second ones, 3 He/ 4 He ratio is 4. 0 to 4. 5 times higher than the atmospheric ratio and delta 13 C values are close to - 2. 6 ‰...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA new {{exploration}} {{phase was}} carried out in the Lamentin plain (Martinique, French West Indies) in 2001. On the three bore-holes drilled by CFG in this area, only the bore-hole located more at north (Californie bore-hole) and near the old LA- 101 borehole, indicated the presence of inflows of hot fluid close to 90 °C starting from 400 m of depth. The main inflow was observed at about this depth. A similar geothermal fluid was also found at a depth of about 400 m in the Carrère bore-hole, situated near thermal springs, but with a lower temperature (50 °C). The geochemical monitoring carried out by BRGM made it possible to find some surface inflows of cold fluid with often a probable marine influence in the three bore-holes and to characterise the chemical and isotopic composition of the low temperature geothermal fluid. According to the geochemical data, this Na-Cl geothermal fluid (TDS ≈ 10 - 11 g/l; pH ≈ 6. 2 - 6. 3) is a mixing of 20 - 25 % sea water and 80 - 75 % fresh water, which could mainly come from the massif of the Pitons du Carbet, following a general structural NW-SE direction. This mixing has reacted with the surrounding volcanic rocks and with magmatic CO 2 emanations (minimum CO 2 partial pressure estimated to 1 bar). Relative to a diluted sea water, it is enriched in dissolved Ca, HCO 3, SiO 2, Sr, Ba, B, As, Fe, Mn, Li, Rb, Cs and Ge and depleted in SO 4 and Mg. Additional chemical and isotopic analyses performed on the fluids of neighbouring thermal springs confirm these results and indicate that the geothermal fluid sampled in the bore-holes has been slightly diluted probably by the drilling fluid. When applied on all these fluids, numerous <b>chemical</b> <b>geothermometers</b> yield concordant values of deep temperature around 90 - 130 °C, which are close to the measured temperatures and to those estimated using the gas geothermometers. The relatively high Mg and SO 4 concentrations of these waters and their absence of a 18 O enrichment from the rocks are rather in agreement with the moderate temperature estimated using the geothermometers. All the results suggest that the temperature gradient increases towards the north of the Lamentin plain where the geothermal reservoir would be rather located. According to the geochemical results, the geothermal fluid would derive from a reservoir situated near sea water, somewhere between the Lamentin plain and the Absalon-Didier area. This fluid would flow out laterally from NW to SE at relatively low depths. No major evidence of a high temperature geothermal reservoir was observed in the Lamentin and Absalon-Didier areas...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the European Hot Dry Rock Energy (HDR) Program, three deep wells (5000 m) have been drilled into a fractured granite basement at Soultz-sous-Forêts, located within the Rhine Graben, in order to develop a deep heat exchanger (GPK- 3 as injector and GPK- 2 /GPK- 4 as producers) and produce electricity after the creation of an EGS reservoir. Despite very few representative analyses of deep geothermal fluids, often contaminated by drilling fluids or injected waters, the geochemical data provide interesting information on the nature, origin, circulation and deep temperature of these fluids (Sanjuan et al., 2006 a and c). They indicate similar chemical and isotopic compositions (NaCl fluids) and high salinity values (TDS about 100 g/l) which suggest a common sedimentary origin and identical water-rock interaction processes. This sedimentary origin is confirmed by the presence of organic matter in highly fractured and altered granite cores (Ledésert et al., 1996) and of dissolved organic carbon in fluid samples. The <b>chemical</b> and gas <b>geothermometers</b> suggest that the native geothermal brine and associated gases are equilibrated with a mineralogical assemblage at temperatures close to 220 - 240 °C (> 200 °C measured a t the bottom-hole; Sanjuan et al., 2006...|$|R
40|$|The Cerro Prieto {{case study}} {{demonstrated}} {{the value of}} a multidisciplinary effort for exploring and developing a geothermal field. There was no problem in recognizing the geothermal potential of the Cerro Prieto area because of the many obvious surface manifestations. However, the delineation of the geothermal reservoir at depth was not so straightforward. Wells drilled near the abundant surface manifestations only produced fluids of relatively low enthalpy. Later it was determined that these zones of high heat loss corresponded to discharge areas where faults and fractures allowed thermal fluids to leak to the surface, and not to the main geothermal reservoir. The early gravity and seismic refraction surveys provided important information on the general structure of the area. Unaware of the existence of a higher density zone of hydrothermally altered sediments capping the geothermal reservoir, CFE interpreted a basement horst {{in the western part of}} the field and hypothesized that the bounding faults were controlling the upward flow of thermal fluids. Attempting to penetrate the sedimentary column to reach the ''basement horst'', CFE discovered the {alpha} geothermal reservoir (in well M- 5). The continuation of the geothermal aquifer (actually the {beta} reservoir) east of the original well field was later confirmed by a deep exploration well (M- 53). The experience of Cerro Prieto showed the importance of <b>chemical</b> ratios, and <b>geothermometers</b> in general, in establishing the subsurface temperatures and fluid flow patterns. Fluid chemical and isotopic compositions have also been helpful to determine the origin of the fluids, fluid-production mechanisms and production induced effects on the reservoir...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to interpret the}} metamorphic condition and fluid composition experienced by metacarbonates on Utö, located in the south-eastern parts of the Stockholm archipelago. Utö {{is a part of}} the Svecofennian domain, and the area Bergslagen, that has hosted several mines over the last millennia. The bedrock in this area has been dated by the U-Pb technique to 1. 90 - 1. 87 Ga, placing it in the Paleoproterozoic era (Allen et al. 1996, Lundström et al. 1998). The rocks, of the studied area on the island of Utö, are mainly metacarbonates with a varying purity and thin layers of volcanic ash. These rocks become more felsic towards the north-western coast as the layers of felsic ash become more dominant. To determine the P-T-XCO 2 of metamorphism, metacarbonates were examined, in the field, in thin sections and mineral chemistry was determined by SEM analysis. Three samples were collected along a 1 km transect, along which the assemblage calcite + dolomite + quartz + tremolite + diopside was observed. Petrographic and SEM analysis were performed to gather chemical data from coexisting calcite and dolomite in order to calculate temperature using the calcite-dolomite <b>geothermometer.</b> <b>Chemical</b> data from the SEM analysis were also run with AX and THERMOCALC together with pressure data received from a study by Engström (2011) of the adjacent island, Persholmen, to generate a T- XCO 2 diagram. Pressure was estimated to 3. 1 +/- 1. 3 kbars, temperature calculated to 442 °C 30 °C and XCO 2 to range from 0, 00067 - 0, 0038 with the standard deviation taken in to account. These results record equilibration with a CO 2 -bearing hydrous fluid at greenschist facies conditions. Metamorphic map of Swede...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the {{framework}} of the European Hot Dry Rock Energy (HDR) Program, three deep wells (5000 m) have been drilled into a fractured granite basement at Soultz-sous-Forêts, located within the Rhine Graben, in order to develop a deep heat exchanger (GPK- 3 as injector and GPK- 2 /GPK- 4 as producers) and produce electricity after the creation of an EGS reservoir. Despite very few representative analyses of deep geothermal fluids, often contaminated by drilling fluids or injected waters, the geochemical data provide new and interesting information on the nature, origin, circulation and deep temperature of these fluids (Sanjuan et al., 2006 a and c). They indicate similar chemical and isotopic compositions (NaCl fluids) and high salinity values (TDS about 100 g/l) which suggest a common sedimentary origin and identical water-rock interaction processes. The <b>chemical</b> and gas <b>geothermometers</b> suggest that the native geothermal brine and associated gases are equilibrated with a mineralogical assemblage at temperatures close to 220 - 240 °C (> 200 °C measured at the bottom-hole; Sanjuan et al., 2006 a and c). According to the Na/Li geothermometer and the  7 Li values, these equilibrium reactions would occur in a sedimentary rather than granite reservoir (Fig. 1). Given the location of the Soultz site and these constraints, this reservoir would be situated more eastern, towards the Graben centre where the Triassic sedimentary formations are the deepest and hottest (Fig. 2). From tracer tests carried out after 2000, the natural flux of the native geothermal brine was estimated at 1 - 1. 2 m 3 /h, which is identical to that calculated for the fluid flux parallel to the Graben strike, based on a convection model and numerical 3 D modeling (Bächler, 2003; Sanjuan et al., 2006 b and c). During all the production and circulation tests, the tracer tests and geochemical data showed the omnipresence of the native geothermal brine in the discharged fluids even after injection of large amounts of external water into the wells. The existence of at least three fluid flow pathways between the wells GPK- 2 and GPK- 3 with different effective fluid velocities, which contrasts with a poor hydraulic connection between GPK- 3 and GPK- 4 (Fig. 3), was highlighted during the fluid circulation loop and the associated tracer test using fluorescein, carried out between July and December 2005 (Sanjuan et al., 2006 b and c) ...|$|R
