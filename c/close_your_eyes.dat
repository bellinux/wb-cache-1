Writing for Idolator, Bradley Stern described the clip as [...] "a strangely trippy, kaleidoscopic affair with lots of weird camera tricks" [...] and {{said that it was}} a [...] "simple, yet effective treatment". However, Mark Savage of Discopop gave the video a negative review, writing, [...] " [...] It's a crying shame that the video for [...] Not on Drugs, is so undercooked.

500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "Playa Playa" [...] {{features}} basketball metaphors and gospel overtones, which accompany the track's slow funk and jazz vibe. On his bass {{playing in the}} song, Pino Palladino recalled [...] "I was thinking about Stevie Wonder in the choruses and P-Funk in the verses". Rob Evanoff of All About Jazz called the song [...] "an uplifting soul ride", and stated that it evokes an image of [...] "a musical train seen far off in the distance, slowly getting bigger as it gets closer". Evanoff also compared the track's style to the jam-sound of Pink Floyd, and wrote [...] "it surrounds you with a deep thick infectious groove that, at first, shadows and then envelopes your senses {{in such a way}} that is equal bits liberating, intoxicating and hypnotic…you <b>close</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> and are transported into another dimension". On the song's lyrics, one critic wrote that [...] "D'Angelo disses all neo-soul wannabes by calmly singing 'Bring the drama playa/Give me all U got'". [...] "Devil's Pie" [...] is a funk and hip hop diatribe with a lyrical theme concerning hip hop excess, and it is accompanied by P-Funk style harmonies and low-key singing by D'Angelo. It is a bass-driven track produced by DJ Premier, who contributes to its hip hop texture. The song's theme also incorporates religious imagery into its message of social strife. Questlove has stated that [...] "Devil's Pie" [...] was written to address the issues of [...] "the money hungry jiggafied state of the world we're in".|$|E

The Edge noted that the song contained [...] "a bit of venom", likening it to [...] "the bitter, John Lennon tradition of 'Working Class Hero', slightly snarling and cynical." [...] Bono stated [...] "as we moved from the eighties to the nineties, I stopped throwing rocks at the obvious symbols of power and the abuse of it. I started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy... 'Acrobat' [...] 'Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see / If you just <b>close</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> / You can feel the enemy...' I can't remember it, but the point is: you start to see the world in a different way, and you're part of the problem, not just part of the solution". In 2006, he noted it was [...] "a song about being a hypocrite, and I think we all can be and I certainly have been. And you know, you exact very high standards on people in the world but then you don't live them personally", noting the theme was most evident in the lyric [...] "I must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that". Hot Press editor Niall Stokes felt The Edge's guitar playing combined elements of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] with [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky". Speaking of its theme he said [...] "at its heart is an awareness of the ravages of time, and what it does to people and to relationships. But beyond that, there is the self-awareness that, itself, comes only with experience... Bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy. He is more conscious now than ever before of the contradictions in his own position." [...] Andy Greene of Rolling Stone believed the [...] "aggressive and venomous" [...] song reflected Bono's thoughts during the album sessions, saying [...] "Nearly every lyric brims with rage... It was a new decade and it was quite possible they were about to be dismissed as a relic of the past." ...|$|E

His first Top 20 Country Hit single, [...] "Miami, My Amy", was released in 1986. While touring for his album L.A. to Miami, he married country singer Lorrie Morgan. In 1988, his first three singles from his studio album Don't <b>Close</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes,</b> the title song, [...] "When You Say Nothing at All" [...] and [...] "I'm No Stranger to the Rain" [...] were number-one hits.

2500|$|During the new {{recording}} {{sessions in}} 1987, Whitley started {{feeling that the}} songs he was doing were not up to his standards, so he approached RCA and asked if the project of 15 songs could be shelved. He {{asked if he could}} assert himself more with the songs and production. The new album, titled Don't <b>Close</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes,</b> was released in 1988, and the album sold extremely well.

2500|$|Spector {{commissioned}} Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil {{to write}} a song for the group, bringing them over from New York to Los Angeles {{to stay at the}} Chateau Marmont Hotel so they could write the song.

Mann wrote the melody first, and came up with the opening line [...] "You never <b>close</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> anymore when I kiss your lips", influenced by a line from the song [...] "I Love How You Love Me" [...] that was co-written by Mann - [...] "I love how your eyes close whenever you kiss me".

[...] The line [...] "you've lost that lovin' feelin'" [...] was originally only intended to be a dummy line that would be replaced later, but Spector liked it and decided to keep it.
