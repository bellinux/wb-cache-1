5|$|One month later, {{while the}} British warship HMS Romney was in port, {{one of the}} tidesmen changed his story: he now claimed {{that he had been}} {{forcibly}} held on the Liberty while it had been illegally unloaded. On June 10, <b>customs</b> <b>officials</b> seized the Liberty. Bostonians were already angry because the captain of the Romney had been impressing colonists, and not just deserters from the Royal Navy, an arguably illegal activity. A riot broke out when officials began to tow the Liberty out to the Romney, which was also arguably illegal. The confrontation escalated when sailors and marines coming ashore to seize the Liberty were mistaken for a press gang. After the riot, <b>customs</b> <b>officials</b> relocated to the Romney, and then to Castle William (an island fort in the harbor), claiming that they were unsafe in town. Whigs insisted that the <b>customs</b> <b>officials</b> were exaggerating the danger so that London would send troops to Boston.|$|E
5|$|The commissioners of the Customs Board {{found that}} {{they were unable to}} enforce trade {{regulations}} in Boston, so they requested military assistance. Help {{came in the form of}} the HMS Romney, a fifty-gun warship which arrived in Boston Harbor in May 1768. Tensions escalated after the captain of the Romney began to impress local sailors. The situation exploded on June 10, when <b>customs</b> <b>officials</b> seized the Liberty, a sloop owned by John Hancock—a leading critic of the Customs Board—for alleged customs violations. Sailors and marines came ashore from the Romney to tow away the Liberty, and a riot broke out. Things calmed down in the following days, but fearful <b>customs</b> <b>officials</b> packed up their families and fled for protection to the Romney and eventually to Castle William, an island fort in the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Foreign comics, {{especially}} Japanese, {{became quite}} successful in Canada, and stood out for gaining {{large numbers of}} female fans, who had traditionally stayed away from comic books. They also had a significant influence on artists such as Bryan Lee O'Malley and his Scott Pilgrim series. Due to differing social norms, the content of these comics are sometimes censored or ran afoul of Canadian <b>customs</b> <b>officials.</b> Incidental nudity could be interpreted by them as child pornography and result in jail terms.|$|E

5|$|Although Roanoke {{has never}} had {{international}} passenger service, in 2001, the Airport Commission was prepared to change the airport's name to Roanoke International Airport. This was the case as the U.S. Customs Service increased the radius covered by the inland port in Dublin to include Roanoke. This expansion allowed for the airport to add <b>customs</b> <b>officials</b> to accommodate both international travel and cargo to pass through Roanoke's facilities. However, the renaming did not occur {{as a result of}} the economic downturn in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 2007, the prospect of changing the airport's name was again mentioned as a possibility by the Airport Commission.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{concern for}} Barnes, when {{returning from the}} United Kingdom to Australia, was to avoid paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included good quality English cloth, in very short supply in Australia at this time. Hearing a rumour that <b>Customs</b> <b>officials</b> were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee.|$|E

5|$|British {{officials}} filed two lawsuits {{stemming from}} the Liberty incident: an in rem suit against the ship, and an in personam suit against Hancock. Royal officials, as well as Hancock's accuser, stood to gain financially, since, as was the custom, any penalties assessed by the court would be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third. The first suit, filed on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the Liberty in August. <b>Customs</b> <b>officials</b> then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in Rhode Island the following year.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 race, Alaskan Bruce Cosgrove {{was denied}} entry by Canadian <b>customs</b> <b>officials</b> in the pre-race {{verification}} process, {{the only time}} a musher has been denied entry into either Canada or Alaska. Cosgrove started the race, but quit before the border. Following the race, controversy again erupted when Alaska Yukon Quest officials announced they would unilaterally eliminate Whitehorse from the Yukon Quest and run a cheaper Fairbanks-to-Dawson City race. Members of the Yukon Quest organization revolted against this and voted to evict the board members who had proposed it.|$|E
5|$|At a {{preliminary}} hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While {{there was no question}} as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian <b>customs</b> <b>officials,</b> defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.|$|E

5|$|In 1825 Hogg {{accompanied}} {{his brother}} John {{on a tour}} of Continental Europe. Jane encouraged him to take the trip, believing {{that it would be a}} test of his commitment to her. He returned to England in February 1826. Although Hogg enjoyed the trip, he missed reading Greek literature and English newspapers. Writing the journals that were published in 1827 under the title Two Hundred and Nine Days occupied much of his time during the trip. He frequently attacked the Catholic Church and <b>customs</b> <b>officials</b> in his journals, but he often made positive observations about the lifestyles of many of the ordinary people that he met. Hogg also recounted his visit to the grave of Percy Shelley in Italy.|$|E
5|$|On April 9, 1768, two customs {{employees}} (called tidesmen) boarded Hancock's brig Lydia in Boston Harbor. Hancock was summoned, {{and finding}} that the agents lacked a writ of assistance (a general search warrant), he did {{not allow them to}} go below deck. When one of them later managed to get into the hold, Hancock's men forced the tidesman back on deck. <b>Customs</b> <b>officials</b> wanted to file charges, but the case was dropped when Massachusetts Attorney General Jonathan Sewall ruled that Hancock had broken no laws. Later, some of Hancock's most ardent admirers would call this incident the first act of physical resistance to British authority in the colonies and credit Hancock with initiating the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Russian <b>customs</b> <b>officials</b> twice {{refused to}} let the target enter the country because of missing or {{incomplete}} paperwork. Over the span of a few days, the target traveled over the Atlantic Ocean five times. On its arrival in Russia in June 2009, the berkelium was transferred to Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (RIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, Ulyanovsk Oblast, where it was deposited as a 300-nanometer-thin layer on a titanium film. In July 2009, it was then transported to Dubna, where it was installed in the particle accelerator at JINR. The calcium-48 beam was generated by chemically extracting the small quantities of calcium-48 present in naturally occurring calcium, enriching it 500 times. This work {{was done in the}} closed town of Lesnoy, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia.|$|E

Blakeney sent ships to help Edward I's war efforts in 1301, {{and between the}} 14th and 16th centuries {{it was the only}} Norfolk port between King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth to have <b>customs</b> <b>officials.</b> Blakeney Church has a second tower at its east end, an unusual feature in a rural parish church. It has been suggested that it acted as a beacon for mariners, perhaps by aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks; that this was not always successful is demonstrated by a number of wrecks in the haven, including a carvel-built wooden ship.|$|E
5|$|The tea ship Dartmouth {{arrived in}} the Boston Harbor in late November, and Adams wrote a {{circular}} letter calling for a mass meeting {{to be held at}} Faneuil Hall on November 29. Thousands of people arrived, so many that the meeting was moved to the larger Old South Meeting House. British law required the Dartmouth to unload and pay the duties within twenty days or <b>customs</b> <b>officials</b> could confiscate the cargo. The mass meeting passed a resolution introduced by Adams urging the captain of the Dartmouth to send the ship back without paying the import duty. Meanwhile, the meeting assigned twenty-five men to watch the ship and prevent the tea from being unloaded.|$|E
5|$|Anonymous {{pamphlets}} {{were published}} describing the event from significantly different perspectives. A Short Narrative of the Horrid Massacre, published {{under the auspices}} of the Boston town meeting, was principally written by James Bowdoin, a member of the governor's council and a vocal opponent of British colonial policy, along with Samuel Pemberton, and Joseph Warren. It described the shooting and other lesser incidents that took place in the days before as unprovoked attacks on peaceful, law-abiding inhabitants, and was, according to historian Neal Langley York, probably the most influential description of the event. The account it provided was drawn from more than 90 depositions taken after the event, and it included accusations that the soldiers sent by Captain Preston had been deployed with the intention of causing harm. In the interest of minimizing impact on the jury pool, city leaders held back local distribution of the pamphlet, but sent copies to other colonies and to London, where they knew depositions collected by Governor Hutchinson were en route. A second pamphlet, Additional Observations on the Short Narrative, furthered the attack on crown officials by complaining that <b>customs</b> <b>officials</b> (one of whom had left Boston to carry Hutchinson's gathered depositions to London) were abandoning their posts under the pretense that it was too dangerous for them to do their duties.|$|E
