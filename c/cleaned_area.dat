40|$|Background: The {{prevention}} {{and management of}} pit and fissure caries has become relatively more important in recent times. There {{is a need for}} an effective preventive measure against pit and fissure caries. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of laser beam as a cleaning method of pits and fissures. Methods: Ho-YAG laser which has a wavelength of 2. 1 µm was used in this experiment. The specimens were extracted human teeth. The effect of three cleaning methods was examined comparatively by scoring the <b>cleaned</b> <b>area</b> of fissure, namely laser irradiation with Ho-YAG laser, chemico-mechanical with combination of 10 % NaOCl and ultrasonic scaler and mechanical with ultrasonic scaler. Vertico-bucco-lingual serial ground sections of each tooth were observed under light microscopy. Scoring the depth of <b>cleaned</b> <b>area</b> was performed by comparing the depth of fissure. result: Progressive result was obtained on the cleaning effect of three methods laser irradiation methods which was the most effective compared to other methods but statistically was not significant. <b>Cleaned</b> <b>area</b> of laser irradiation method was 48. 91 %, chemico-mechanical method was 41. 77 % and mechanical method was 36. 78 %. Conclusion: Holmium -yttrium aluminum garner laser is a relatively new method for pit and fissure cleaning even though the effectivity is not yet maximal. More research is needed to maximize the use of this laser. </span...|$|E
40|$|Pre-construction Primer (PCP) is an {{epoxy resin}} {{charged with a}} zinc powder, applied at low {{thickness}} to minimize rusting of steel plates during storage and fabrication in shipbuilding industries. In this material, the zinc, {{in contact with the}} iron support, acts as a sacrificial anode protecting the surface from corrosion. However, this coating is problematic when the steel plate requires to be welded. In fact, the solid polymeric coating sublimates when exposed at the high temperatures due to the welding process, producing porosity in the welding bead. Different methods can be used to remove the primer before the welding: brushing, sand or ice blasting, waterjet, chemical solvent and laser cleaning. In this paper, laser cleaning tests were carried out by etching a 10 x 10 mm 2 surface of primer coated steel plate, using a 30 W QSwitched Yb:YAG fibre laser. The cleaning tests were carried out varying the scan speed, the pulse power and the distance between two consecutive beam travel (Step). From the treated surface analysis, the percentage of <b>cleaned</b> <b>area</b> was obtained and the process parameters were correlated to the percentage of <b>cleaned</b> <b>area.</b> The process window where laser cleaning could be successfully performed and the maximum process speed were individuate. Finally, observation about the energy consumption and the energy efficiency were reported...|$|E

40|$|Cleaning {{of process}} {{equipment}} {{is a necessity}} in the pharmaceutical and food industry. Recently, the efficiency of these cleaning processes has come more into focus due to increasing economical and ecological demands. Different approaches to assess cleaning processes {{in terms of their}} cleaning effectiveness, cleaning efficiency, cleaning rate and cleaning performance are discussed. Stainless steel sheets soiled with Xanthan gum were cleaned by a moving impinging water jet in a laboratory scale test rig. Different assessment criteria (time, fluid consumption and energy) to determine the related cleaning performance indicators were studied. The influence of operating parameters (nozzle diameter, gauge pressure and jet moving speed) on these performance indicators was quantified. Experiments showed that the <b>cleaned</b> <b>area</b> width, used as a quantitative criteria of cleaning, decreased with jet moving speed. The influence of the three operating parameters on the performance indicators was evaluated. The experimental results reveal that there is no parameter combination which optimizes the performance indicators simultaneously: the best combination depends on the priority given to each indicator...|$|E
40|$|A {{scanning}} tunneling microscope tip is used {{to create}} nanoscale contacts on degenerately doped n+-Si(100) surfaces. Current-voltage spectra are recorded as the tip transitions from tunneling to point contact on surfaces prepared in three ways: (1) the clean 271 surface, (2) with a covalently bonded benzene overlayer, and (3) through nanoscale clean silicon windows formed within the benzene film. Contacts to the clean surface are more Ohmic than rectifying and show a surface leakage current that arises from partially occupied 3 ̆c 0 * states. Contacts to the benzene surface do not display a surface current and exhibit significant current rectification. The unpinning of the Si band structure by the organic adsorbate leads to inversion and a limiting minority-carrier tunnel current under reverse bias. Contacts to the windows simulate defects to an overlayer and reveal characteristics of a hybrid junction. Current-voltage spectra through the windows are free of surface leakage and are independent of the <b>cleaned</b> <b>area.</b> The return of majority carrier tunneling under reverse bias demonstrates that the pinning states of the clean substrate are restored to the windows. However, the charge distribution on the windows is {{significantly different from the}} clean surface because the restored surface states are isolated within the benzene monolayer.

40|$|Black crust, or gypsum crust, is a {{surficial}} {{accumulation of}} atmospheric deposits in a gypsum matrix, {{which is often}} firmly bonded to the substrate. This condition is ubiquitous on marble buildings, not only threatening the historic fabric, but also leading to aesthetic damage. Laser ablation cleaning has become a popular method to remove black crust from masonry surface. This study focuses on the evaluation of laser ablation cleaning on the Pennsylvania marble of the Hood Cemetery Gate, which locates in Germantown, Philadelphia, PA. In advance of cleaning, the marble and the black crust was characterized through petrographic thin-sections, X-Ray Diffraction, and Scanning Electron Microscopy to understand the micro-structure and chemical composition of the materials, A low power portable fiber laser was used for cleaning and evaluation. Laboratory cleaning tests on small samples were conducted to determine the effective parameters, in dry and wet conditions. The <b>cleaned</b> <b>area</b> was examined with a spectrophotometer, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy to detect potential changes in, surface morphology, and chemical composition. In-situ cleaning test was conducted using the optimal parameters {{based on the results}} of laboratory tests, and the outcome was evaluated in terms of color change. In conclusion, laser ablation cleaning was generally effective on the marble of the Hood Cemetery Gate.

40|$|Background. During the {{outbreak}} of the emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection, 130 % of the ∼ 8000 infected persons were health care workers. The highly infectious nature of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) compelled our pathologists to consider biosafety issues in the autopsy room and for tissue processing procedures. Methods. A specially designed biosafety level 3 (BSL- 3) autopsy laboratory was constructed and divided into a <b>clean</b> <b>area,</b> a semicontaminated area, a contaminated area, and 2 buffer zones. High-efficiency particulate air filters were placed in the air supply and exhaust systems. Laminar air flow was from the <b>clean</b> <b>areas</b> to the less <b>clean</b> <b>areas.</b> The negative pressures of the contaminated, semicontaminated, and <b>clean</b> <b>areas</b> were approximately 50 pa, 25 pa, and 5 pa, respectively. Personal protective equipment, including gas mask, impermeable protective clothing, and 3 layers of gloves worn during autopsies; the equipment was decontaminated before it was allowed to exit the facility. Strict BSL- 3 practices were followed. Results. When a given concentration of particulate sarin simulant was introduced into the contaminated area, it could not be detected in either the semicontaminated <b>area</b> or <b>clean</b> <b>area,</b> and particles 10. 3 mm in size were not detected in the exhaust air.

40|$|The Global Chemical Leasing Award was {{presented}} {{for the first}} time in March 2010 to organizations, companies and individuals for their outstanding efforts to enhance the visibility of Chemical Leasing around the world and reward successful Chemical Leasing initiatives and implementation. Chemical Leasing is the new business model in the field of sound use of chemicals, initiated and subsidized by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Agriculture, Forestry, the Environment and Water Management and jointly promoted with UNIDO. The decisive new aspect of this business model, which distinguishes itself from the traditional supplier-user relation, is to make the service performed by the chemical substance the basis of payment for the business operation, e. g. according to <b>cleaned</b> <b>area,</b> treated number of pieces, or performed hours of operation (= unit of payment). In this way an efficient use of chemicals is in the interest of all parties involved. The award was jointly organized by UNIDO and the Austrian Federal Ministry for Agriculture, Forestry, the Environment and Water Management. Organizations, companies and individuals worldwide were able to take part in the competition. The cases of the winners are described in detail and show the applicability of Chemical Leasing to the different industrial processes. Among these are water clarification and oil dehydration in Colombia, mineral water and beverage production in Serbia, oil & gas exploration and production and specifically deep gas field development projects in different places, industrial cleaning with solvents in Austria and textile dyeing in India...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{autologous}} {{implantation technique}} (ACI) {{was first introduced}} in studies on cartilage defects in knees. It has later been used {{for the treatment of}} osteochondral knee lesions. The patient presented here had a hip osteochondral defect measuring 4 cm in diameter. He was a candidate for hip prosthesis because of serious pain and reduced function. Being young and highly motivated for alternatives to prosthesis he was to our knowledge the first patient treated with ACI to the hip in 1999. Methods: Autologous chondrocytes obtained from knee cartilage biopsies were grown at a laboratory in Gothenburg. The operation was done at The University Hospital North Norway where removal of damaged cartilage and loose bony fragments was done on an operatively luxated hip. In the <b>cleaned</b> <b>area</b> implantation of chondrocytes under a periosteal covering was done. Gradual increased weight bearing was allowed postoperatively. Results: Immediately postoperatively the patient reported significant relief of pain, and in the period of more than 15 following years he generally estimated pain to be 70 % reduced from the preoperative value. Frequent MR examinations the first postoperative year showed gradual filling of the defect in bone and cartilage. Contrast MRI at 22 months depicted the surface of the repaired area quite smooth. At the last control more than 15 years following ACI he reported limited pain, walked without a limp; and moderate osteoarthritis seen previously had developed further. Knowing the result, he was happy to have gone through the procedure. Conclusion: The patient has gained more than fifteen prosthesis-free years because of the ACI operation. Quite normal cartilage adjacent to the large defect was carrying weight, and the repair area was not destroyed, as probably would have been the case in osteoarthritis. A success on the various attempts to produce normal cartilage in vitro, able to carry some weight immediately after implantation, could in the future open up for improved biological treatment of large defects, both chondral and osteochondral, in hip and knee...|$|E
40|$|In 1985, the {{collapse}} of the tailing dam in Chenzhou lead/zinc mine (Hunan, southern China) led to the spread of mining waste spills on the farmland along the Dong River. After the accident, an urgent soil cleaning up was carried out in some places. Seventeen years later, cereal (rice, maize, and sorghum), pulses (soybean, Adzuki bean, mung bean and peanut), vegetables (ipomoea, capsicum, taro and string bean) and the rooted soils were sampled at four sites: (1) the mining area (SZY), (2) the area still covered with the mining tailing spills (GYB), (3) the <b>cleaned</b> <b>area</b> from mining tailing spills (JTC), and (4) a background site (REF). Metal concentrations in the crops and soils were analyzed to evaluate the long-term effects of the spilled waste on the soil and the potential human exposure through food chains. The results showed that the physical–chemical properties of the soils obviously changed due to the different farming styles used by each individual farmer. Leaching effects and plant extraction of metals from some soils were quite weak. Certain soils were still heavily polluted with As, Cd, Zn, Pb and Cu. The contamination levels were in the order of GYB>SZY>JTC showing that the clean-up treatment was effective. The maximum allowable concentration (MAC) levels for Chinese agricultural soils were still highly exceeded, particularly for As and Cd (followed by Zn, Pb and Cu), with mean concentrations of 709 and 7. 6 mg kg− 1, respectively. These concentrations exceed the MAC levels by 24 times for As and 13 times for Cd at GYB. Generally, the edible leaves or stems of crops were more heavily contaminated than seeds or fruits. Ipomoea was the most severely contaminated crop. The concentrations of Cd and Pb were 3. 30 and 76. 9 mg kg− 1 in ipomoea leaves at GYB, which exceeded the maximum permit levels (0. 5 mg kg− 1 for Cd and 9 mg kg− 1 for Pb) by 6. 6 and 8. 5 times, respectively. Taro (+skin) could accumulate high concentrations of Zn and Cd in the edible stem, and rice and capsicum had high Cd concentration in the edible parts. However, the toxic element concentrations in maize, sorghum, Adzuki bean, soybean and mung bean remained lower than the threshold levels. The bio-accumulation factors (BAFs) of crops were in the order: Cd>Zn>Cu>Pb>As. BAF was typically lower in the edible seeds or fruits than in stems and leaves. The accumulation effect strongly depends on the crop's physiological properties, the mobility, of the metals, and the availability of metals in soils but not entirely on the total element concentrations in the soils. Even so, the estimated daily intake amount of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb from the crops grown in the affected three sites and arsenic at SZY and GYB exceeded the RDA (Recommended dietary allowance) levels. Subsequently, the crops grown in Chenzhou Pb/Zn mine waste affected area might have a hazardous effect on the consumer's health. This area still needs effective measures to cure the As, Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu contamination...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of the total solar eclipse of 22 July 2009 on surface ozone and other photo-oxidants over central China using the WRF-Chem model. Chemical and {{meteorological}} observation data were used to validate the model, and results suggest that the WRF-Chem model can capture {{the effects of}} the total solar eclipse well. The maximum impacts of the eclipse occur over the area of totality, with a decrease in surface temperature of 1. 5 °C and decrease in wind speed of 1 m s− 1 . In contrast, the maximum impacts on atmospheric pollutants occur over parts of north and east China where emissions are greater, with an increase of 5 ppbv in NO 2 and 25 ppbv in CO and a decrease of 10 ppbv in O 3 and 3 ppbv in NO.
