40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{mode coupling}} between two co-directional quasi-harmonic Rayleigh surface waves on an isotropic solid is analysed {{using the method}} of multiple scales. This procedure yields a system of six semi-linear hyperbolic partial differential equations with the same principal part governing the slow variations in the (complex) amplitudes of the two fundamental, the two second harmonic and the two <b>combination</b> <b>frequency</b> waves at {{the second stage of}} the perturbation expansion. A numerical solution of these equations for excitation by monochromatic signals at two arbitrary frequencies, indicates that there is a continuous transfer of energy back and forth among the fundamental, second harmonic and <b>combination</b> <b>frequency</b> waves due to mode coupling.

40|$|There {{are many}} Slowly Pulsating B (SPB) stars and gamma Dor {{stars in the}} Kepler Mission data set. The light curves of these {{pulsating}} stars have been classified phenomenologically into stars with symmetric light curves and with asymmetric light curves. In the same effective temperature ranges as the gamma Dor and SPB stars, there are variable stars with downward light curves that have been conjectured {{to be caused by}} spots. Among these phenomenological classes of stars, some show `frequency groups' in their amplitude spectra that have not previously been understood. While it has been recognised that nonlinear pulsation gives rise to <b>combination</b> <b>frequencies</b> in a Fourier description of the light curves of these stars, such <b>combination</b> <b>frequencies</b> have been considered to be a only a minor constituent of the amplitude spectra. In this paper we unify the Fourier description of the light curves of these groups of stars, showing that many of them can be understood in terms of only a few base frequencies, which we attribute to g mode pulsations, and <b>combination</b> <b>frequencies,</b> where sometimes {{a very large number of}} <b>combination</b> <b>frequencies</b> dominate the amplitude spectra. The frequency groups seen in these stars are thus tremendously simplified. We show observationally that the <b>combination</b> <b>frequencies</b> can have amplitudes greater than the base frequency amplitudes, and we show theoretically how this arises. Thus for some gamma Dor and SPB stars <b>combination</b> <b>frequencies</b> can have the highest observed amplitudes. Among the B stars are pulsating Be stars that show emission lines in their spectra from occasional ejection of material into a circumstellar disk. Our analysis gives strong support to the understanding of these pulsating Be stars as rapidly rotating SPB stars, explained entirely by g mode pulsations. Comment: Accepted MNRAS; 17 page...|$|R

40|$|<b>Combination</b> <b>frequencies</b> are {{observed}} in the Fourier spectra of pulsating DA and DB white dwarfs. They appear at sums and differences of frequencies associated with the stellar gravity-modes. Brickhill (1992) proposed that the <b>combination</b> <b>frequencies</b> result from mixing of the eigenmode signals as the surface convection zone varying in depth when undergoing pulsation. This depth changes cause time-dependent thermal impedance, which mix different harmonic frequencies in the light curve. Following Brickhill's proposal, we developed analytical expressions to describe the amplitudes and phases of these <b>combination</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The parameters that appear in these expressions are: {{the depth of the}} stellar convection zone when at rest, the sensitivity of this depth towards changes in stellar effective temperature, the inclination angle of the stellar pulsation axis with respect to the line of sight, and lastly, the spherical degrees of the eigenmodes involved in the mixing. Adopting reasonable values for these parameters, we apply our expressions to a DA and a DB variable white dwarf.

We identify at least six real modes, and at least five <b>combination</b> <b>frequencies.</b> We measure line-of-sight velocities for our spectra and detect periodic variations at the frequencies of five of the six real modes, with amplitudes of up to 5 km/s. We argue that these variations reflect the horizontal surface motion associated with the g-mode pulsations. No velocity signals are detected at any of the <b>combination</b> <b>frequencies,</b> confirming that the flux variations at these frequencies do not reflect physical pulsation, but rather mixing of frequencies due to a non-linear transformation in the outer layers of the star.

40|$|Abstract. Nonlinear {{pulsation}} {{models of}} Cepheids pulsating in {{first and second}} overtone modes have been constructed in order to study their transient double-mode behaviour. The purposes were to: (1) verify the possible nonlinear effects on period ratios; (2) compare the general nonlinear characteristics of the theoretical light curves with the observed ones; (3) check the plausibility of the hypothesis of very low metallicity of CO Aur. The analysis of the transient behaviour indicates {{that the difference between}} linear and nonlinear period ratios is always negligible, and hence period ratios of linear models can be used for comparisons with observed values. Moreover, the Fourier analysis suggests that, for a given order of fit, some <b>combination</b> <b>frequency</b> terms should be preferentially detected in real stars, and this is confirmed by observations. Finally, the models suggest that first and second overtone double-mode Cepheids with very low metallicity must have much shorter period than CO Aur; this supports the view that CO Aur is compatible only with a standard mass-luminosity relation...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{is based on the}} {{theoretical}} assumptions that frequency of characters and their structural components, as well as the frequency types of structural components, are important to enable learners of Chinese as a foreign language (CFL) to discover the underlying structure of Chinese characters. In the CFL context, since reliable target language input is limited largely to textbook materials and teacher instruction, it is important to more rigorously examine the inventory of Chinese characters that is typically presented in CFL textbooks. The {{purpose of this study was}} to systematically describe and classify Chinese characters from ten CFL textbooks designed for college and adult beginning learners. The main focus was to compare the textbooks in the following areas: explicit orthographic decomposition instruction, character frequency selection, radical <b>combination</b> <b>frequency,</b> radical semantic transparency, radical positional regularity among different character graphic structures, phonetic element reliability, and phonetic component <b>combination</b> <b>frequency.</b> To accomplish the analysis required for this study, a special character database was created. Dictionaries were used to classify character characteristics, and documented frequency lists were used to classify the character usage frequency. The findings revealed that most textbooks rarely include explicit orthographic decomposition instruction in the vocabulary lists or lessons, while over 40 % of the characters in most of the textbooks did not combine with other characters to form words. In addition, analysis of frequency lists created over time revealed that the ten textbooks generally contain many high frequency characters. Furthermore, the results indicated that 60 % of the characters in the database were classified by relatively few radicals (17 %), with most radicals appearing on the left side of the characters. Relatively reliable phonetic analogy groups appeared frequently. About half of the characters are semantic-phonetic compound characters. Less than 10 % of the characters in the textbooks are semantic-phonetic compound characters that contain semantically transparent radicals and reliable phonetic elements. The results of the study suggest that textbook writers should consider integrating orthographic decomposition and component frequency materials into their textbooks, as systematic instruction in textbooks is generally lacking. Teachers should also be mindful of emphasizing the high frequency characters that are consistently featured in all textbooks, as well as the frequently appearing radicals and left-right internal structure of many of the characters.

The pulsation frequencies vary periodically in a 12. 9 year cycle and undergo secular changes that are inconsistent with simple neutrino plus photon-cooling models. The magnitude of the periodic and secular variations increases with {{the period of the}} pulsations, possibly hinting that the corresponding physical mechanism is located near the surface of the star. The phase of the periodic variations appears coupled to the sign of the secular variations. The standards for pulsation-timing-based detection of planetary companions around pulsating white dwarfs, and possibly other variables such as subdwarf B stars, should be re-evaluated. The physical mechanism responsible for this surprising result may involve a redistribution of angular momentum or a magnetic cycle.

(b) Much of the entire power spectrum is a tightly woven network of combination frequencies: (i) Below 0. 25 c/d, numerous frequencies are difference frequencies. (ii) Many frequencies above 2. 5 c/d can be represented as sum frequencies {{and in a few}} cases as harmonics. (iii) Many frequencies between 1. 1 and 1. 75 c/d can be portrayed as parents of <b>combination</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The number and fraction of <b>combination</b> <b>frequencies</b> increases steeply with decreasing amplitude and and accuracy of the frequency matching.
