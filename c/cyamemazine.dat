50|$|<b>Cyamemazine</b> (Tercian), {{also known}} as cyamepromazine, is a typical {{antipsychotic}} drug of the phenothiazine class which was introduced by Theraplix in France in 1972 and later in Portugal as well. It {{is used for the}} treatment of schizophrenia and, especially, for psychosis-associated anxiety, due to its unique anxiolytic efficacy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyamemazine</b> {{differs from}} other {{phenothiazine}} neuroleptics in that {{aside from the}} usual profile of dopamine, α1-adrenergic, H1, and mACh receptor antagonism, it additionally produces potent blockade of several serotonin receptors, including 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT7. These actions have been implicated in cyamemazine's anxiolytic effects (5-HT2C) and lack of extrapyramidal side effects (5-HT2A), and despite being classified as a typical, it actually behaves like an atypical antipsychotic.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} <b>cyamemazine</b> a {{dopamine}} D 2 receptor antagonist on voluntary ethanol consumption in rats and on ethanol withdrawal in mice was examined. Male Sprague-Dawley rats {{were tested in}} a free choice (water and 10 % ethanol) experiment and consumed 5 g/kg ethanol daily. Rats were treated daily IP with <b>cyamemazine</b> (0. 5, 1, or 2 mg/kg) or acamprosate (100 mg/kg) during 2 weeks. Both acamprosate and 1 mg/kg <b>cyamemazine</b> significantly decreased ethanol intake by 45 % without affecting either fluid or food intake. The lowest dose of <b>cyamemazine</b> {{had no effect on}} alcohol intake but increased food intake. The highest dose had no effect on any variables. During the post-treatment period, only 1 mg/kg <b>cyamemazine</b> decreased both ethanol and fluid intakes. Mice were made dependent on alcohol using a chocolate fluid diet containing increasing concentrations of alcohol and withdrawn after 9 days. Mice were treated with <b>cyamemazine</b> (1 or 0. 5 mg/kg, respectively) or with the same doses of lorazepam acutely on the day of withdrawal or chronically (during alcohol treatment). Both chronic and acute <b>cyamemazine</b> and lorazepam treatments decreased convulsions during ethanol withdrawal. Both acute treatments decreased locomotor activity in control and alcohol dependent mice. Chronic treatment had no effect on locomotor activity. We suggest that <b>cyamemazine</b> could reduce alcohol consumption by antagonizing the activation of the dopaminergic pathways during the induction of alcohol dependence. The action of <b>cyamemazine</b> on 5 -HT 3 receptors could also explain its effect on alcohol convulsions during withdrawal convulsions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAnimal {{and human}} {{pharmacological}} {{studies indicate that}} the antipsychotic action of <b>cyamemazine</b> results from blockade of dopamine D(2) receptors, its anxiolytic properties from serotonin 5 -HT(2 C) receptor antagonism and the low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects from a potent 5 -HT(2 A) receptor antagonistic action. <b>Cyamemazine</b> is metabolized in monodesmethyl <b>cyamemazine</b> and <b>cyamemazine</b> sulfoxide, which are not known for their affinities for serotonin, dopamine and other brain receptor types considered to mediate central nervous systems effects of drugs. Hence, metabolite affinities were determined in human recombinant receptors expressed in CHO cells (hD(2) and hD 4. 4 receptors, h 5 -HT(1 A), h 5 -HT(2 A), h 5 -HT(2 C) and h 5 -HT(7) receptors and hM(1), hM(2) and hM(3) receptors) and HEK- 293 cells (h 5 -HT(3) receptors) or natively present in rat cerebral cortex (non-specific alpha(1) - and alpha(2) -adrenoceptors, GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors) and guinea pig cerebellum (H(1) central histamine receptors) membranes. Monodesmethyl <b>cyamemazine</b> showed a neurotransmitter receptor profile {{similar to that of}} its parent compound <b>cyamemazine,</b> i. e. : high affinity for h 5 -HT(2 A) receptors (K(i) = 1. 5 nM), h 5 -HT(2 C) receptors (K(i) = 12 nM) and hD(2) receptors (K(i) = 12 nM). <b>Cyamemazine</b> sulfoxide showed high affinity for h 5 -HT(2 A) receptors (K(i) = 39 nM) and histamine H(1) receptors (K(i) = 15 nM) and a reduced affinity for D(2) and 5 -HT(2 C) receptors. Therefore, monodesmethyl <b>cyamemazine</b> can contribute to enhance and prolong the therapeutic actions of <b>cyamemazine.</b> Further investigation is required to see if the high affinities of <b>cyamemazine</b> sulfoxide for H(1) and 5 -HT(2 A) receptors are of therapeutic benefit against sleep onset insomnia and/or sleep maintenance insomnia respectively...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{antipsychotic}} <b>cyamemazine</b> is {{a potent}} serotonin 5 -HT(2 A) receptor (5 -HT(2 AR)) antagonist. A positron emission tomography (PET) study in human patients showed that therapeutic doses of <b>cyamemazine</b> produce near saturation of 5 -HT(2 AR) occupancy in the frontal cortex, whereas dopamine D(2) occupancy remained below the level for motor side effects observed with typical antipsychotics. Recently, numerous studies have revealed the involvement of 5 -HT(2 AR) in the pathophysiology of anxiety and a double-blind, randomized clinical trial showed similar efficacy of <b>cyamemazine</b> and bromazepam in reducing the anxiety associated with benzodiazepine withdrawal. Therefore, we reviewed the above articles about 5 -HT(2 AR) and anxiety {{in order to understand}} better the anxiolytic mechanisms of <b>cyamemazine</b> in benzodiazepine withdrawal. The 5 -HT(2 AR) is the most abundant serotonin receptor subtype in the cortex. Non-pharmacological studies with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and genetically modified mice clearly showed that cortical 5 -HT(2 AR) signaling positively modulates anxiety-like behavior. With a few exceptions, most other studies reviewed here further support this view. Therefore, the anxiolytic efficacy of <b>cyamemazine</b> in benzodiazepine withdrawal can be due to a 5 -HT(2 AR) antagonistic activity at the cortical level...|$|E
40|$|A 50 -year-old man {{presented}} with a scaly erythema of the face, upper chest, forearms, and dorsum of the hands. He has been treated with <b>cyamemazine</b> for 6 months. Photopatch tests were performed and the patient was diagnosed with photoallergic reaction to <b>cyamemazine.</b> The drug was discontinued and a course of oral steroids was prescribed. The patient was advised to avoid light exposure. There has been no evidence of recurrence during a six-month follow-up period. Photoallergic reactions are much less frequent than phototoxic disorders. It {{is well known that}} several drugs including neuroleptics of the phenothiazine family may produce a skin eruption on light-exposed areas by dose-dependent (phototoxic) or photoallergic mechanisms. It is believed that photopatch testing, which is the clinical investigation of choice for suspected photoallergic reactions, is significantly underused in Europe and probably world-wide.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Antipsychotics (APs) {{have been}} {{associated}} with risk of torsade de Pointes (TdP). This has important public health implications. Therefore, (a) we exploited the public FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to characterize their torsadogenic profile; (b) we collected drug utilization data from 12 European Countries to assess the population exposure over the 2005 - 2010 period. METHODS: FAERS data (2004 - 2010) were analyzed based on the following criteria: (1) ≥ 4 cases of TdP/QT abnormalities; (2) Significant Reporting Odds Ratio, ROR [Lower Limit of the 95 % confidence interval> 1], for TdP/QT abnormalities, adjusted and stratified (Arizona CERT drugs as effect modifiers); (3) ≥ 4 cases of ventricular arrhythmia/sudden cardiac death (VA/SCD); (4) Significant ROR for VA/SCD; (5) Significant ROR, combined by aggregating TdP/QT abnormalities with VA and SCD. Torsadogenic signals were characterized in terms of signal strength: from Group A (very strong torsadogenic signal: all criteria fulfilled) to group E (unclear/uncertain signal: only 2 / 5 criteria). Consumption data were retrieved from 12 European Countries and expressed as defined daily doses per 1, 000 inhabitants per day (DID). RESULTS: Thirty-five antipsychotics met at least one criterium: 9 agents were classified in Group A (amisulpride, chlorpromazine, clozapine, <b>cyamemazine,</b> haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone). In 2010, the overall exposure to antipsychotics varied from 5. 94 DID (Estonia) to 13. 99 (France, 2009). Considerable increment of Group A agents was found in several Countries (+ 3. 47 in France) : the exposure to olanzapine increased across all Countries (+ 1. 84 in France) and peaked 2. 96 in Norway; <b>cyamemazine</b> was typically used only in France (2. 81 in 2009). Among Group B drugs, levomepromazine peaked 3. 78 (Serbia); fluphenazine 1. 61 (Slovenia). CONCLUSIONS: This parallel approach through spontaneous reporting and drug utilization analyses highlighted drug- and Country-specific scenarios requiring potential regulatory consideration: levomepromazine (Serbia), fluphenazine (Slovenia), olanzapine (across Europe), <b>cyamemazine</b> (France). This synergy should be encouraged to support future pharmacovigilance activities...|$|E
40|$|Neuroleptics {{may cause}} side effects, {{some of which}} are little known. We {{describe}} here a case of gastric dilation related to treatment with a neuroleptic in an elderly man. To our knowledge, such a case has never been reported in the literature. A 76 -year-old man, living in a nursing home, was hospitalized for general weakness and abdominal pain. He had dementia with behavioral disorders treated with <b>cyamemazine,</b> a sedative and anxiolytic neuroleptic. Given a clinical suspicion of intestinal occlusion, an abdominopelvic computerized tomography scan was performed before the patient was admitted to our hospital. This computerized tomography scan did not show intestinal occlusion and {{there was no mention of}} gastric dilation in the computerized tomography scan report. Thus, acute gastroenteritis was suspected. The usual medications were stopped and symptomatic treatment for gastroenteritis was started. Quickly, his clinical state and biological parameters returned to normal and his usual treatment, including <b>cyamemazine,</b> was started again. The next day, the digestive symptoms, except for obstipation, reappeared. The abdominal X-ray showed gastric dilation without intestinal occlusion. The neuroleptic was stopped again and symptoms vanished the next day. This report underlines all of the necessary precautions and surveillance around drug prescription, especially in elderly persons...|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{understand}} more completely why patients treated with phenothiazines (chlorpromazine and <b>cyamemazine),</b> methotrexate, and certain antibiotics such as cindamycin have {{an increased risk of}} developing pseudomembranous colitis, the production of toxins A and B by Clostridiwm djff'cile in the presence of these drugs was measured in vitro as well as in vivo by using axenic mice. None of the drugs tested increased the production of toxins either in vitro or in vivo. Clostidium difficile is widely incriminated in cases of pseudomembranous colitis (PMC) and postantibiotic diar-rhea (15, 20, 21). The pathogenicity of this organism is due to the production of two toxins: toxin A (enterotoxin), which has strong enterotoxic activity and weaker cytotoxic activity and toxin B, which is strongly cytotoxic. Both toxins are lethal to tissue culture cells and animals (16, 19, 23, 25, 32). It has been known for some time that antibiotics such as clindamycin can lead to both PMC and postantibiotic diar-rhea (1 - 5, 11 - 14, 27, 31). It is suspected that antibiotic...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent {{studies have}} shown a strong link between Toxoplasma gondii {{infection}} and psychiatric disorders, especially schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (odd ratio ≈ 2. 7 for each disorder). Antipsychotic drugs and mood stabilizers may have anti-toxoplasmic activity that potentially {{may be associated with}} better effectiveness in these disorders, but previous results have been few in number and conflicting. We therefore sought to determine which daily prescribed antipsychotics and mood stabilizer have the best anti-toxoplasmic activity during the development phase of the parasite. In the present study, we examined the effects of commonly used antipsychotic drugs (amisulpride, <b>cyamemazine,</b> fluphenazine, haloperidol, levomepromazine, loxapine, olanzapine, risperidone and tiapride) and one mood-stabilizing agent (valproate) on toxoplasmic activity. We replicated that fluphenazine has a high anti-toxoplasmic activity, but {{it does not seem to}} be a phenothiazine-specific class effect: indeed, we found that another first-generation antipsychotic, zuclopenthixol, has a high anti-toxoplasmic activity. Valproate, tiapride and amisulpride have no anti-toxoplasmic activity on parasite growth, and the other antipsychotic drugs showed low or intermediate anti-toxoplasmic activity. As it is not possible to know the intracellular concentrations of antipsychotics in the brain, further clinical studies are warranted to determine whether these in vitro findings have potential implications in treatment of toxo-positive patients with schizophrenia. These findings may be potentially relevant for the choice of the first-line antipsychotic drug or mood stabilizer in previously infected patients...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Clozapine (CLOZ) and {{levomepromazine}} (LMP) improve treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The superior {{efficacy of}} CLOZ {{compared with other}} antipsychotic agents {{has been attributed to}} an effect on D 1 -like and D 4 receptors. We examined the binding of LMP, CLOZ and <b>cyamemazine</b> (CMZ), a neuroleptic analog of LMP, to human recombinant dopamine (rDA) receptor subtypes. Methods: Binding studies were performed on frozen membrane suspensions of human rDA receptor subtypes expressed in Sf 9 cells. Results: (i) LMP has a high affinity (Ki, nM) for rD 2 receptor subtypes (rD 2 L 8. 6; rD 2 S 4. 3; rD 3 8. 3; rD 4. 2 7. 9); (ii) LMP and CLOZ have comparable affinities for the rD 1 receptor (54. 3 vs 34. 6); (iii) CMZ has high affinities for rD 2 -like and rD 1 -like receptors (rD 2 L 4. 6; rD 2 S 3. 3; rD 3 6. 2; rD 4. 2 8. 5; rD 1 3. 9; rD 5 10. 7); (iv) CMZ is 9 times more potent than CLOZ at the rD 1 receptor and 5 times more potent than CLOZ at the rD 4. 2 receptor; (v) CMZ has high affinities for rD 1 and rD 5 receptor subtypes compared with LMP and CLOZ. Conclusions: If D 1 and D 4 receptors are important sites for the unique action of CLOZ, the present study points to a need for clinical trials comparing CMZ with CLOZ in schizophrenia and in particular, treatment-resistant schizophrenia, especially given the risk for agranulocytosis with CLOZ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{pharmaceutical}} products are emerging pollutants continuously {{released into the}} environment, because they cannot be effectively removed by the wastewater treatment plants. In recent years, {{questions have been raised}} concerning the environmental risks related to these pollutants. The goal of this research was to evaluate the responses in Lemna minor after 7 days and in Corbicula fluminea after differing durations (1, 3, 7, and 19 days) of exposure to the psychoactive drug mixture (valproic acid, citalopram, carbamazepine, <b>cyamemazine,</b> hydroxyzine, oxazepam, norfluoxetine, lorazepam, fluoxetine, and sertraline) in different concentrations (0, 0 + ethanol, drug concentration (DC) 1 = river water concentration, DC 2 = effluent concentration, and DC 3 = 10 × effluent concentration). In this aim, growth parameters of L. minor, gluthathione S-transferase (GSTs), catalase (CAT),ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and/or gene expressions (pi-gst, cat, cytochrome P 450 4 (cyp 4), multidrug resistant 1 (mdr 1), and superoxide dismutase (sod)) were measured. GST activities increased significantly in L. minor exposed to DC 3, but no changes were found in CAT activity. In C. fluminea, EROD activity was induced significantly in both gill and digestive gland tissues after 3 days’ exposure to DC 3, while a GST increase was observed only in digestive gland tissues, suggesting that these pharmaceuticals induced an oxidative effect. Gene expression analysis revealed transient transcriptomic responses of cyp 4, sod, and mdr 1 under drug concentrations 2 or 3 and no change of expression for the other genes (cat and pi-gst) or condition (environmental drug concentration) tested. Finally, the data reported in this study represent important ecotoxicological information, confirming that this enzyme family (cyp 4, sod, and mdr 1) may be considered as a sensible and early indicator of exposure to drugs and emphasizing the involvement of selected genes in detoxification pathways...|$|E
