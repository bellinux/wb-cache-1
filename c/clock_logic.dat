On-board clock oscillators and global clock lines usually mitigate these issues, but sometimes these resources {{may be limited}} or not fulfill all design requirements. Internal clocks should be implemented within FPGA devices since clock line and clock buffers connections are limited between FPGAs. Internal clocked designs which are partitioned across multiple FPGAs should replicate the clock generator within the FPGA, ensuring a low clock skew between inter-FPGA signals. In addition, any gated <b>clock</b> <b>logic</b> should be transformed to clock enables to reduce skew while operating at high clock frequencies.|$|E
