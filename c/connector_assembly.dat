50|$|Field-mountable {{optical fiber}} {{connectors}} {{are used to}} join optical fiber jumper cables that contain one singlemode fiber. These assemblies can be separated into two major categories: single-jointed connector assemblies and multiple-jointed connector assemblies. According to Telcordia GR-1081, a single-jointed <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> is a <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> where {{there is only one}} spot where two different fibers are joined together. This is the situation generally found when connector assemblies are made from factory-assembled optical fiber connector plugs. A multiple-jointed <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> is a <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> where {{there is more than one}} closely spaced connection joining different fibers together. An example of a multiple-jointed <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> is a <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> that uses the stub-fiber type of connector plug.|$|E

50|$|Optical fiber {{connectors}} {{are used}} to join optical fibers where a connect/disconnect capability is required. The basic connector unit is a <b>connector</b> <b>assembly.</b> A <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> consists of an adapter and two connector plugs. Due to the sophisticated polishing and tuning procedures that may be incorporated into optical connector manufacturing, connectors are generally assembled onto optical fiber in a supplier’s manufacturing facility. However, the assembly andpolishing operations involved can be performed in the field, for example to make cross-connect jumpers to size.|$|E

40|$|Cathodic {{delamination}} failure {{is believed to}} be caused by the production of OH- at the polymer/metal interface via oxygen reduction reactions. In cable <b>connector</b> <b>assemblies,</b> the use of manufacturing processes and materials that are resistant to cathodic {{delamination failure}}s is highly desirable. Also, {{there is a need for}} an accelerated testing regime for assessing the resistance of polymer-to-metal composites to cathodic delamination failures. Cable <b>connector</b> <b>assemblies</b> are employed in marine environments for structural terminations and circuit interconnection of electrical power and signal cabling systems. They are found on offshore sea beds, ROV’s, vessels and submarines and are prone to cathodic delamination related failures particularly when the cable assemblies are coupled to dissimilar metal appurtenances in seawater, e. g., zinc anodes. The resistance to cathodic delamination failures of selected metal substrates and polymeric materials used in the manufacture and sealing of cable <b>connector</b> <b>assemblies</b> have been investigated. Materials and methods of surface preparation by grit blasting to enhance polymer-to-metal adhesion, thus increasing the service life-time expectation of cable <b>connector</b> <b>assemblies</b> have been elucidated. Methods of accelerated testing of polymer/metal bond durability using salt spray test and the validation of the results in seawater immersion tests and potentiostatic experiments have been described. Also, a novel accelerated test chamber for cathodic delamination tests was designed and manufactured. Applied potential was observed to be the factor that had the most negative effect on test samples while silicon carbide grit was found to produce the most effective surface cleanliness and roughness combination required for durable polymer-to-metal bonds.

5000|$|MIL-DTL-83538, (formerly MIL-C-83538) {{describes}} connectors and accessories, electrical, circular, umbilical. The <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> {{provides the}} necessary connections {{required to meet}} a MIL-STD-1760, Class I electrical interface between stores and their associated launchers using a [...] "blind mating" [...] mechanism. The <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> consists of a receptacle installed on the launcher, a receptacle installed on the store, and a buffer plug installed between the two receptacles. This specification also includes the required mounting adapters and nut, accessory adapter, cable bushing, and protective covers. This <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> provides the transfer of MIL-STD-1760 interface class I electrical signals and power between an aircraft (or ground vehicle) mounted launcher and an associated store. This connector is military unique because {{it is intended to}} be used on rail and eject launchers where engagement/disengagement of the launcher receptacle (with attached buffer plug) to the store receptacle will be via a blindmate mechanical mechanism; whereas no known commercially equivalent substitute is available. The insert arrangement is 25-20 of MIL-STD-1560.|$|E

50|$|Another variant {{that never}} saw duty was the T20E2. It was {{experimental}} gas-operated, selective fire rifle {{with a slightly}} longer receiver than M1 and modified to accept 20-round Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) magazines. The rifle was machined and tapped on left side of receiver for scope mount, and included the same hardware for mounting a grenade launcher as the M1. The bolt had a hold open device on the rear receiver bridge, {{as well as a}} fire selector similar to the M14. Full automatic fire was achieved by a <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> which was actuated by the operating rod handle. This, in turn, actuated a sear release or trip which, with the trigger held to the rear, disengaged the sear from the hammer lugs immediately after the bolt was locked. In automatic firing, the cyclic rate of fire was 700 rpm. When the <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> was disengaged, the rifle could only be fired semi-automatically and functioned {{in a manner similar to}} the M1 rifle. The T20 had an overall length of 48 1/4", a barrel length of 24", and weighed 9.61 lbs. without accessories and 12.5 lbs. with bipod and empty magazine. Designated as limited procurement in May, 1945. Due to cessation of hostilities with Japan, number for manufacture was reduced to 100. The project was terminated in March 1948.|$|E

50|$|Hybrid {{connectors}} have housings with inserts {{that allow}} the intermixing of many connector types, such as those mentioned above. These housings may also allow intermixing of electrical and non-electrical interfaces, examples of the latter being pneumatic line connectors, and optical fiber connectors. Because hybrid connectors are modular in nature, they tend to simplify assembly, repair, and future modifications. They also allow the creation of composite cable assemblies that can reduce equipment installation time by {{reducing the number of}} individual cable and <b>connector</b> <b>assemblies.</b>|$|R

50|$|Most of the M1A rifles {{manufactured}} since 1971 {{were made}} for the commercial market, and thus were only capable of semi-automatic fire. Springfield Armory, Inc. and Smith Enterprise Inc. were the two companies that produced select fire M14 type rifles for civilian ownership. Up until May 1986, Springfield Armory, Inc. had a Full Auto Department at their factory in Illinois. A few M1A rifles were converted to full-auto fire and registered with the ATF by Class II manufacturers like Neal Smith and Rock Island Armory. The receivers of these select fire rifles have the selector lug and operating rod rail cuts for the <b>connector</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|E
50|$|SMA {{connectors}} {{are rated}} {{for up to}} 500 mating cycles, but to achieve this {{it is necessary to}} properly torque the connector when making the connection. A 5/16-inch torque wrench is required for this, set to 3-5 in·lbf (0.3 to 0.6 N·m) for brass, and 7-10 in·lbf (0.8 to 1.1 N·m) for stainless steel connectors. Flats are sometimes also provided on the cable side of the <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> so that a second wrench can be used to prevent it from rotating and damaging the joint to the cable. It is also advisable to inspect and clean out loose debris from the internal surfaces with compressed air or a gas duster can before mating.|$|E
5000|$|ITT Interconnect Solutions is a {{globally}} diversified connector and <b>connector</b> <b>assembly</b> manufacturing company. Founded in 1915 as Cannon (company) by James H. Cannon, {{the company}} developed {{some of the}} first equipment for sound films {{in the early years of}} the movie industry, including a synchronous motor drive to remotely operate a motion picture projector together with a phonograph. The first [...] "Cannon plug", the M-1 connector, was initially designed as a quick grounding connection for the electrical motor on a portable meat grinder and was adapted for movie sound equipment, enabling the new electrical camera to move freely about while “shooting” a scene. Cannon's M-1 connector was incorporated into the sound equipment used to make the first [...] "talking" [...] motion picture, The Jazz Singer. Cannon continued to develop connectors for the entertainment industry, including the “P” Series audio connectors developed for Paramount Studios, as well as connectors used in the first radio microphones, the first black-and-white television cameras, and the first color television equipment.|$|E

40|$|A {{proposed}} tool {{would be}} used to inspect alignments of mating twinaxial-connector assemblies on interconnecting wiring harnesses. More specifically, the tool {{would be used}} to inspect the alignment of each contact pin of each connector on one assembly with the corresponding socket in the corresponding connector on the other assembly. It is necessary to inspect the alignment because if mating of the assemblies is attempted when any pin/socket pair is misaligned beyond tolerance, the connection will not be completed and the dielectric material in the socket will be damaged (see Figure 1). Although the basic principle of the tool is applicable to almost any type of mating connector assemblies, the specific geometry of the tool must match the pin-and-socket geometry of the specific mating assemblies to be inspected. In the original application for which the tool was conceived, each of the mating assemblies contains eight twinaxial connectors; the pin diameter is 0. 014 in. (. 0. 35 mm), and the maximum allowable pin/socket misalignment is 0. 007 in. (. 0. 18 mm). Incomplete connections can result in loss of flight data within the functional path to the space shuttle crew cockpit displays. The tool (see Figure 2) would consist mainly of a transparent disk with alignment clocking tabs that can be fitted onto either <b>connector</b> <b>assembly.</b> Sets of circles or equivalent reference markings are affixed to the face of the tool, located at the desired positions of the mating contact pairs. An inspector would simply fit the tool onto a <b>connector</b> <b>assembly,</b> engaging the clocking tabs until the tool fits tightly. The inspector would then align one set of circles positioning a line of sight perpendicular to one contact within the <b>connector</b> <b>assembly.</b> Mis alignments would be evidenced by the tip of a pin contact straying past the inner edge of the circle. Socket contact misalignments would be evidenced by a crescent-shaped portion of the white dielectric appearing within the circle. The tool could include a variable magnifier plus an illuminator that could be configured so as not to cast shadows...|$|E
