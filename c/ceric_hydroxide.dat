50|$|Basic cerium(IV) nitrate has {{the formula}} Ce(NO3)3.OH.3H2O. It also forms upon {{evaporation}} of solutions of cerium(IV) in nitric acid. When this meets ammonia in water solution it reacts to form {{ceric ammonium nitrate}} and <b>ceric</b> <b>hydroxide.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ceric {{potassium}} nitrate [...] has two different crystal forms, hexagonal and monoclinic. Slow evaporation and crystallization {{results in the}} monoclinic form. But fast crystallization results {{in a mixture of}} the two shapes. Both of these forms have six nitrate groups connected via two oxygens each to the cerium [...] The substance is made by dissolving <b>ceric</b> <b>hydroxide</b> in nitric acid with the appropriate stoichiometric amount of {{potassium nitrate}}. In the hexagonal form the cerium atoms are arranged along a threefold axis. In hexagonal form the potassium ions are surrounded by nine oxygen atoms. These crystals are orange hexagonal shaped plates. Crystal cells contain three molecules, with a volume of 1063.1Å3 and dimensions of a=13.5737Å c=6.6624Å with a density of 2.767 g/cm3.|$|E
40|$|An {{electrochemical}} {{route to}} this oxidative precipitation was studied wherein a rare earth chloride solution {{is subjected to}} electrolysis enabling the separation of cerium as <b>ceric</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> A rotating cathode was used to avoid formation of hydroxide scale on the cathode surface. The electrolytic and solution parameters were optimized in laboratory scale and bench scale cells. The process occurred at a current efficiency of 60...|$|E
