Some such exercises take place annually like the Varuna with the French Navy, Konkan with the Royal Navy, Indra with Russian Navy, Malabar with the US Navy, Simbex with the Republic of Singapore Navy, and IBSAMAR with the Brazil and South African navies. The Indian Navy also conducted exercise with the People's Liberation Army Navy in 2003, and also sent ships to the South China Sea {{to participate in the}} fleet review. Apart from the Indian Ocean, India has steadily gained influence in the Pacific Ocean.

Recent regional efforts to combat maritime security threats in the Gulf of Aden have drawn comparisons to similar efforts undertaken in the Malacca Straits.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Over {{the past}} ten years, reports of piracy {{and other forms of}} {{maritime}} violence have been dramatically on the rise. As these reports increase, so too does international attention toward how to solve this. This thesis examines the development of <b>cooperative</b> maritime <b>security</b> efforts in both Southeast Asia and the Middle East, paying particular attention to the Horn of Africa and Gulf of Aden region, as they pertain to turning the tide of violence in their respective maritime domains. Recent regional efforts to combat maritime security threats in the Gulf of Aden, and maritime piracy in particular, have drawn comparisons to similar efforts undertaken in the Straits of Malacca in the early parts of the past decade. However, such comparisons fail to address the unique nature of the politics and history of security cooperation in the Horn of Africa, particularly the way states in the region tend to rely upon external security support from more powerful nations, such as the United States and Japan. Additionally, often times these experts fail to discuss the cultural idiosyncrasies of the various nations. Despite some similarities shared between the two regions, the states of the Horn of Africa must deal with issues of prioritization, regional animosities, and external dependence before they can attempt to develop <b>cooperative</b> maritime <b>security</b> arrangements akin to those existing in Southeast Asia. Success will require a concerted effort by states in the region and realization by the United States of its role in supporting effective security cooperation in the region...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{proliferation}} of the Internet {{in recent years}} has radically altered the landscape of network security. Despite continuing attempts by organisations to secure corporate networks, the high rate of successful network attacks have led to significant financial losses. This paper concerns the protection of virtual networks against network attack. The limitations of current security tools are outlined. Based on this analysis, a Distributed <b>Cooperative</b> Multi-layer <b>Security</b> Architecture (DCMSA) for virtual networks is proposed. The structure of the DCMSA is detailed and the advantages of this architecture are discussed. In short, the DCMSA provides distributed security enforcement combined with centralised management. Further, it uses the synergy of different security tools working together and multiple layers of defence to provide enhanced protection.

40|$|Even with {{substantial}} investment in cyber defense resources, {{the risk of}} harm from cyber attacks can be significant for modern organizations. The effectiveness of cyber defense might be enhanced if organiza-tions that face similar cyber threats have programs in place {{that allow them to}} share information and re-sources relating to cyber security. Despite clear benefits, cyber defense teams also face motivations not to cooperate with those in other organizations. These motivations include potential damage to reputation, competition, and group inertia. We created a simulation model to better understand decision-making and cooperative dynamics in cooperative cyber defense programs. The model uses the Behavioral Influence Assessment framework, a hybrid cognitive-system dynamics modeling framework based on psychologi-cal, social, and behavioral economic theory. The model was populated and calibrated using data and in-terviews with subject matter experts, and used to explore policy options that could make a <b>cooperative</b> cyber <b>security</b> program more effective. ...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{security}} issues on MANET have {{become one of}} the primary concerns. A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a continuously self-configuring, infrastructure-less network of mobile connected without wires. IDSs are designed for wired networks and work only under certain conditions, i. e. having an infrastructure with central authority, no <b>cooperative</b> algorithms. <b>Security</b> is mainly achieved by prevention, i. e. to make attacks as difficult as possible These conditions are not or only partially fulfilled by MANETs. The MANET is more vulnerable to be attacked than wired network. For this reason, there is a need of mechanism to detect and response these newer attacks, i. e. “intrusion detection”. The disadvantage of misuse detection is unable to detect Unknown attack and anomaly detection generates the false alarm any time traffic. To solve this problems we are combining anomaly and misuse detection technique to explore and to classify current techniques o...|$|R
40|$|The Kurds have {{historically}} been subjected to structural forms of oppression such as being {{denied the right to}} land, their language, culture, political participation or even a passport and social security number. Within this process the Kurdish women’s marginalisation has been doubled as they have been subjected to patriarchal laws, restricting their rights. In the aftermath of the Arabic spring the Syrian government decided to withdraw their forces from the Kurdish region Rojava and instead of turning it into an independent state, the Kurds decided to create a stateless democracy through autonomous cantons. Inspired by the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan’s idea of Democratic Confederalism, Rojava now uses a system of stateless democracy with the help of hundreds of councils that exist in the different communes and villages. The Kurdish women’s movement has created autonomous structures with women’s academies, houses, tribunals, <b>cooperatives,</b> <b>security</b> forces and military units. In this study I conducted semi-structured interviews with seven female activists from the autonomous women’s movement in Rojava. My research question was: How does the Kurdish women’s movement make sense of their reclaim of citizenship? I firstly analysed my informants’ statements as chronological narratives of their changing citizen-status, beginning when they still were colonised by Syria and ending with their practice of stateless democracy. I discovered that the informants had constructed two identities that represented the Kurdish women’s transformation from disempowered non-citizens to empowered citizens: ‘The housewife’ and ‘The female combatant’ who are each other’s contrasts. Secondly, I analysed the women’s practices of citizenship through their use of autonomous women’s structures as action spaces. These action spaces made it possible for the women to mobilise their reclaim of citizenship. By using Kabeer’s theory of citizenship as a bridge that enables empowerment to turn into gender justice, I found that the women’s movement in Rojava were attempting to change gender roles and structures, making their reclaim of citizenship feminist. The thesis contributes to understanding how marginalised people experience citizenship and shows that citizenship is a social construction and thereby something that can be both taken from you as well as reclaimed...|$|R
