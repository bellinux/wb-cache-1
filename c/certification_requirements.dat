The study investigates the prediction that the new regulations affect jurors' assessment of guilt for failing to discover fraud, and also whether the regulations affect jurors' perceptions of the appropriateness of auditors' actions regarding fraud detection and of auditors' and officers' responsibility for the fraudulent financial statements. The study tests whether these perceptions mediate the association between the regulations and mock jurors' guilt assessments. Results show that jurors assess auditors as less guilty under SAS No. 99 and {{in the presence of}} the officer <b>certification</b> <b>requirement.</b> SAS No. 99 decreases guilt assessments indirectly through jurors' perception that auditors acted more appropriately under the new standard. Although jurors did view auditors as more responsible under SAS No. 99, their responsibility perceptions had no effect on guilt assessments. An additional finding is that the officer <b>certification</b> <b>requirement</b> has an indirect effect on guilt assessments via jurors' perceptions of the officers' responsibility for the fraudulent financial statements. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} exit availability on evacuation time for narrow body aircraft under certification trial conditions using computer simulation. A narrow body aircraft which has previously passed the certification trial is used as the test configuration. While maintaining the <b>certification</b> <b>requirement</b> of 50 % of the available exits, six different configurations are examined. These include the standard certification and five other exit configurations based on commonly occurring exit combinations found in accidents. These configurations are based on data derived from the AASK database and the evacuation simulations are performed using the airEXODUS evacuation software. The {{results show that the}} certification practise of using half of the available exits predominately down one side of the aircraft is neither statistically relevant nor challenging. For the aircraft cabin layout examined, the exit configuration used in certification trial produces the shortest egress times. Furthermore, three of the six exit combinations investigated result in predicted egress times in excess of 90 seconds, suggesting that the aircraft would not satisfy the <b>certification</b> <b>requirement</b> under these conditions...|$|R

25|$|According to the {{official}} accident report, after the first officer made his initial rudder pedal input, he {{made a series of}} alternating full rudder inputs. This led to increasing sideslip angles. The resulting hazardous sideslip angle led to extremely high aerodynamic loads that resulted in separation of the vertical stabilizer. If the first officer had stopped making these inputs at any time before the vertical stabilizer separation, the natural stability of the airplane would have returned the sideslip angle to near 0°, and the accident would have been avoided. The airplane performance study indicated that when the vertical stabilizer separation began, the aerodynamic loads were about two times the loads defined by the design envelope. It can be determined that the vertical stabilizer's structural performance was consistent with design specifications and exceeded <b>certification</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E

25|$|While the {{evolution}} of paramedicine described above is focused largely on the US, many other countries followed a similar pattern, although often with significant variations. Canada, for example, attempted a pilot paramedic training program at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, in 1972. The program, which intended to upgrade the then mandatory 160 hours of training for ambulance attendants, {{was found to be}} too costly and premature. The program was abandoned after two years, and {{it was more than a}} decade before the legislative authority for its graduates to practice was put into place. An alternative program which provided 1,400 hours of training at the community college level prior to commencing employment was then tried, and made mandatory in 1977, with formal certification examinations being introduced in 1978. Similar programs occurred at roughly the same time in Alberta and British Columbia, with other Canadian provinces gradually following, but with their own education and <b>certification</b> <b>requirements.</b> Advanced Care Paramedics were not introduced until 1984, when Toronto trained its first group internally, before the process spread across the country. By 2010 the Ontario system involved a two-year community college based program, including both hospital and field clinical components, prior to designation as a Primary Care Paramedic, although it is starting to head towards a university degree-based program (for example, the joint degree in paramedicine offered by Centennial College and the University of Toronto). Some services, such as Toronto Paramedic Services, continue to train advanced care paramedics internally.|$|E
