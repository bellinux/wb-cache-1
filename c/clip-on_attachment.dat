40|$|Solospun is a {{spinning}} technology which provides {{the means to}} produce a singles yarn that can be successfully woven as either warp or weft. The technology is a versatile and cost effective alternative to two-folding, Sirospun or sizing. It offers significant benefits in terms of efficiency and productivity. Solospun is a simple, inexpensive, <b>clip-on</b> <b>attachment</b> for the spinning of long staple, weavable singles yarns. The technology {{is the result of}} a joint development between CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology, The Woolmark Company and WRONZ and was commercially released in 1998. It is now successfully operating in worsted mills worldwide. The Solospun hardware consists of a pair of rollers held in a bracket, which is clipped onto the front of the pendulum-drafting arm. Each roller is positioned immediately below, and parallel to, each top front draft roller where it interacts with the emerging drafted fibre strand before twist insertion. The roller-fibre interaction subtly changes the structure of the yarn, which dramatically increases its abrasion resistance. This allows Solospun yarns to be woven without two-folding or sizing, providing significant cost savings. Depending on fabric structure, weaving performance is equivalent to that of conventional two-fold yarns. Fabrics woven from Solospun yarns are of good quality and appearance. Some aspects, including preferred hand and FAST results, are equal or superior to two-fold yarn fabrics. As with compact and condensed spinning, Solospun offers significant reductions in yarn hairiness. However, Solospun can be simply implemented on existing spinning frames and goes much further by making the singles yarns weavable...|$|E

The different configurations are achieved using two Phantom Omni haptic devices {{combined with a}} series of <b>clip-on</b> <b>attachments.</b> Aside from the flexibility to easily reconfigure the interface, three of the four configurations provide functionality which is either not readily available or is cost prohibitive for many applications...|$|R
