50|$|MaterialsCast iron in {{the form}} of grey cast iron has been used for {{commercial}} pipeline construction since the 1800s in Europe. Grey cast iron has high resistance to mechanical and <b>chemical</b> <b>influences.</b> However, it is a very brittle material with low impact strength. Through a refined manufacturing process the tensile strength and flexural stiffness are dramatically improved. With the addition of magnesium graphite into the grey cast iron melt, graphite flakes are transformed into spherical graphite nodules and with appropriate heat treatment the embrittlement is prevented yielding a material of increased ductility and strength. Ductile cast iron is composed of 90-95% iron {{in the form}} of scrap metal. It {{should be noted that the}} high dynamic stresses generated by driving in some cases exceed the service level design stresses. The driving process can be thought of as a quality control measure of wall thickness and crystalline structure.|$|E
50|$|Trap rock, i.e. basalt or diabase, has {{a variety}} of uses. A major use for basalt is crushed rock for road and housing {{construction}} in concrete, macadam, and paving stones. Because of its insensitivity to <b>chemical</b> <b>influences,</b> resistance to mechanical stress, high dry relative density, frost resistance, and sea water resistance, trap rock is used as ballast for railroad track bed and hydraulic engineering rock (riprap) in coast and bank protection for paving embankments. It is also used for the production of cast rock that is used in corrosion and abrasion protection, as for sewage pipes and acid-resistant rocks. Other uses of trap rock include gardening and landscaping, for the production of millstones, for the production of mineral fibres (basalt wool), as a flux in ceramic masses and glazes, for the production of glass ceramics, crushed as a filter aggregate (air filtration of poison gas in ABC bunkers), as filter bed material water treatment facilities, and ground as a soil improvement product. Trap rock has been used to construct buildings and churches: Trinity Church on the Green with trap rock quarried from Eli Whitney's quarry, is a particularly colorful example of a red-orange-brown-colored, natural-faced trap rock. It was also used for foundations and railroad beds in the New Haven area.|$|E

40|$|The growth {{effects of}} the differentiation-enhancing amino acids, /-tyrosine and l-phenylalanine, have been {{reported}} in a previous communication. 1 The physiological effects upon rhythmicity and contractility of the 62, 72, and 96 hour chick hearts are here reported. Since the 62 to 96 hour embryo chick heart is free of nervous control, the peculiar qualities of rhythmicity and contractility may be rightly attributed to either inherent potency, <b>chemical</b> <b>influences,</b> or both. By <b>chemical</b> <b>influences</b> is here meant either direct stimulation or depression due to naturally occurring compounds or to metabolic products of such substances upon the myocardial syncytium. /-Tyrosine and/-phenylalanine bear structural relationship to epinephrine, ephedrine, tyramine, and thyroxine. These four products produce specific physiological manifestations which may easily be identified as such. Consequently, the work reported in this paper was designed to determine the ease with which syncytial heart muscle of the 72 hour chick embryo could convert or utilize/-tyrosine or/-phenylalanine in this way. In addition, it was of interest, in the event that these naturally occurring amino acids would have any such action, to study the effects upon the quality of the pulsations and any alteration in the conduction pattern as compared to the known effects produced by/-epinephrine. Since these amino acids are present in such high concentrations in the hen's egg, it was thought that this information might have important bearing in relation to the initlatioxa of rhythmicity in such hearts. Method Fertile hen's eggs were obtained from a reputable hatchery within 24 hours after laying. These were incubated in a moist chamber incubator...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCharacterization of {{time-dependent}} brittle deformation {{is important}} for estimating the long-term stability of rock structures in shallow environments such as underground mines which are exposed to water or in a water vapor environment. The poro-mechanical (pore pressure) and chemical (stress corrosion reactions) effects of fluids at crack tips {{are responsible for the}} subcritical propagation of microcracks. This brittle creep results in the weakening of porous rocks over time (i. e., static fatigue). The focus of this work was to characterize using very long duration uniaxial multi-step creep tests, both the fluids effects on subcritical stress corrosion cracking in a porous rock (oolithic iron ore). Different fluids with increasing levels of <b>chemical</b> <b>influence</b> (oil, ethanol and water) were tested and both acoustic and mechanical properties were investigated. The evolution of the cumulative number of AE (Acoustic Emission) events, which reproduces the shape of the creep curves very efficiently, and static elastic properties indicate that micro-cracking plays the main role in the creep process. The poro-mechanical effect, which is predominant under partially saturated (water or ethanol) conditions, decreases the rate of subcritical cracking through capillary attraction forces. These forces harden porous rocks by modifying the effectiVe stress state, increasing the activation energy barrier of the stress corrosion process and the fracture toughness and decreasing the stress intensity factor. The chemical effect of fluids is related to minerals developing stress corrosion reactions at crack tips which enhance subcritical cracking. Immersion in water/ethanol annihilates capillary forces and decreases the activation energy of the chemical reactions, thus increasing dilatancy, the rate of stress corrosion cracking, AE activity and rock weakening. Under saturated conditions, the timedependent strength and time to failure increase as the <b>chemical</b> <b>influence</b> of the interstitial fluid decreases but the cumulative number and energy of AE at failure {{do not seem to be}} influenced by the chemistry of fluids. The short-term strength and deformability are also influenced by the level of <b>chemical</b> <b>influence</b> of the interstitial fluid but to a less remarkable extent because of the slow rate of chemical reactions. Water is therefore the most effective chemical agent promoting stress corrosion of iron ore among the fluids tested in our study...|$|R

30|$|After the {{anodic bonding}} process, the bonded {{substrates}} usually become the final electronic device, through performing subsequent {{processes such as}} chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), thin film deposition, etch and dicing [4, 5]. Subsequent processes are indispensable for the complete fabrication of a specific MEMS device; however fracture is frequently observed on the anodically bonded substrates, caused during the subsequent processes [5 â 7]. Since the two materials (glass and silicon) have slightly different thermal expansion coefficients, the substrates bonded at high temperatures will have a residual stress at room temperature, resulting in fractures on the bonded substrate, obtained during the subsequent processes. In other words, the anodically bonded substrate involving residual stress may be fractured or deformed, due to mechanical and <b>chemical</b> <b>influences</b> present during the subsequent processes. Therefore, stress analysis is important to improve subsequent process stability and device production yield.|$|E
