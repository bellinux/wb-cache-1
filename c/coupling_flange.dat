Two different systems will be analyzed: {{the first is a}} six bolts <b>flange</b> <b>coupling</b> working in nominal conditions, the second is a five bolts <b>flange</b> <b>coupling</b> working in some failure conditions with only five bolts distributed in a six holes <b>flange</b> <b>coupling.</b> In certain conditions the <b>flange</b> <b>coupling</b> design allows the same torque to be transmitted by six, but also by only five bolts. However, the non-uniformity of the five bolts distribution around the six holes flanges will generate some other unwanted phenomena. In this case all the stress and deformations will be non-symmetrically and for the <b>flange</b> <b>coupling</b> that is a rotating coupling this can be one reason for beats phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Coupling is a {{mechanical}} component used for transmitting power from one shaft to another shaft rotating at particular RPM {{at a long}} distance. In <b>flange</b> <b>coupling</b> two shafts are connected together at their ends {{with the help of}} flanges for transmitting power. The rigid <b>flange</b> <b>coupling</b> is specially designed and developed for horizontal shaft mounted gear unit applications. Today every manufacturing industry has a challenge to increase the strength to weight ratio of the component. In the project our objective is to decrease the weight of <b>flange</b> <b>coupling.</b> For this, composite material aluminium silicon carbide is used for the flange which is light in weight and good thermal and mechanical properties.

40|$|Abstract: A {{coupling}} is {{a device}} {{which is responsible}} for the effective power transmission between two shafts rotating at a certain rpm. Couplings are connected at the ends of the shafts and these may slip or get disconnected depending upon the torque limits. In fact, these are critical parts of any transmission system, providing the smooth transmission of power and they can last long if maintained properly. This paper deals with the possible causes of failure for a <b>flange</b> <b>coupling</b> which occur mostly at the areas of contact, analysis of such failures and suggestions to minimize the failures occurred thereof. In this regard, a model of the <b>flange</b> <b>coupling</b> would be prepared {{and with the help of}} an analysis workbench, proper material would be assigned to that particular <b>flange</b> <b>coupling</b> and points of failure would be noted accordingly.

40|$|Misalignment {{is one of}} {{the most}} common sources of trouble of {{rotating}} machinery having couplings between the shafts. Ideal alignment is a chimera and the <b>coupling</b> <b>flanges</b> of the shafts are never ideally aligned, presenting angular and/or parallel misalignment (defined also as radial misalignment or offset). In particular, during the shaft rotation, if coupling misalignment between the shafts of a statically aligned line is excessive, a periodical change, of the load on the bearings in hyperstatic shaft-lines, occurs. If the rotating machine is equipped with oil-film bearings, the change of the loads on the bearings causes also the variation of their oil-film dynamic characteristics, i. e. damping and stiffness, and the complete system cannot be considered as linear. In the paper, this phenomenon is modelled accurately and analyzed by considering the simulated response of a misaligned rotor train in the time domain. A finite element model is used for the hyperstatic rotor, while bearing characteristics are calculated by integrating Reynolds equation (considering the actual type and dimensions of the bearings) as a function of the instantaneous load acting on the bearings, caused by the coupling misalignment. Nonlinear effects are highlighted and the spectral components of system response are analyzed, in order to give pertinent diagnostic information...|$|R

40|$|Vacuum seals {{are very}} {{important}} to ensure that the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Linac has an optimum vacuum system. The vacuum joints between flanges must have reliable seals to minimize the leak rate and meet vacuum and electrical requirements. In addition, it is desirable to simplify the installation and thereby also simplify the maintenance required. This report summarizes an investigation of the metal vacuum seals that include the metal C-seal, Energized Spring seal, Helcoflex Copper Delta seal, Aluminum Delta seal, delta seal with limiting ring, and the prototype of the copper diamond seals. The report also contains the material certifications, design, finite element analysis, and testing for all of these seals. It is a valuable reference for any vacuum system design. To evaluate the suitability of several types of metal seals for use in the SNS Linac and to determine the torque applied on the bolts, a series of vacuum leak rate tests on the metal seals have been completed at Los Alamos Laboratory. A copper plated flange, using the same type of delta seal that was used for testing with the stainless steel flange, has also been studied and tested. A vacuum seal is desired that requires significantly less loading than a standard ConFlat flange with a copper gasket for the coupling cavity assembly. To save the intersegment space the authors use thinner flanges in the design. The leak rate of the thin ConFlat flange with a copper gasket is a baseline for the vacuum test on all seals and thin flanges. A finite element analysis of a long <b>coupling</b> cavity <b>flange</b> with a copper delta seal has been performed in order to confirm the design of the long <b>coupling</b> cavity <b>flange</b> and the welded area of a cavity body with the flange. This analysis is also necessary to predict a potential deformation of the cavity under the combined force of atmospheric pressure and the seating load of the seal.

From these studies, the appropriate seals that are reliable for SNS long coupling cavities and beamline joints were determined...|$|R
