40|$|It is {{reviewed}} whether cooling flows could fuel <b>central</b> <b>radio</b> {{sources in}} spheroidal galaxies as a general, universal mechanism. The radio luminosity functions of S 0, E, gE and cD galaxies show a similar scaled dependence on Lopt, demanding a non-exclusive radio powering mechanism for cD's. If cooling flows generate the <b>central</b> <b>radio</b> sources in these objects, then a non-exclusive X-ray halo formation process should occur. Gravitational accretion of {{gas from the}} intergalactic medium is identified as such a mechanism for both E+S 0 's and cD's. From studying a sample of 110 objects the author finds strong evidence for gravitationally driven cooling flows fuelling <b>central</b> <b>radio</b> sources in spheroidal galaxies...|$|R

We present Chandra observations of the galaxy cluster Abell 2029, which contains a dense X-ray core and a <b>central</b> steep-spectrum <b>radio</b> source.
