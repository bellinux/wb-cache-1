The <b>Centre</b> <b>Union</b> alleged that the election result had been staged by the shadowy [...] "para-state" [...] (παρακράτος) agents, including the army leadership, the Greek Central Intelligence Service, and the notoriously right-wing National Guard Defence Battalions, according to a prepared emergency plan code-named Pericles.
