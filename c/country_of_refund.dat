40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{some legal}} aspects {{pertaining to the}} idea <b>of</b> <b>refunding</b> social insurance contributions to temporary migrant workers. It presents three possible methods <b>of</b> <b>refunding</b> contributions: a repatriation bonus, an individual pension reserve and an ‘opt-in’ scheme. These three schemes are tested on two countries: the Netherlands and the United States of America. The test reflects the interests of different stakeholders: the migrant workers themselves, the migrant workers’ <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin and the host countries. The article concludes that whether refunding social insurance contributions to temporary migrant workers is an attractive policy alternative strongly depends on the national context. For specific social security programmes in the United States, the article suggests that contribution refunding might be worth considering. But on the whole it concludes that refunding contributions can only be a second best solution. Aiming for proper national standards of protection for migrant workers, supplemented by a network of international social security agreements still presents the most honourable course. status: publishe...|$|R

Moreover, it is ambiguous whether refunding continues over time to provide larger incentives for technological upgrading than a non-refunded emission tax, since the effects <b>of</b> <b>refunding</b> dissipate as the overall industry becomes cleaner...|$|R
40|$|The Main problem {{formulation}} of this thesis is {{to investigate whether}} taxation in a situa-tion <b>of</b> <b>refunding</b> <b>of</b> a conditional shareholder´s contribution can stand in contradictory {{to the principle of}} legal security. Fundamentally is a case, named RÅ 2009 ref. 47 : 2. In the case the court decided to conform to the tax avoidance act on the situation <b>of</b> <b>refunding</b> <b>of</b> the shareholder´s contribution. The consequence of that was that the part-owner in the case got taxed as it received dividend from the company instead <b>of</b> <b>refunding</b> <b>of</b> the share-holder´s contribution. The Judgment by the court will be investigated in order to clarify whether it can stand in contradictory to the principle of legal security. In the courts judgment in the case there are several interesting aspects. Firstly because it set outs how the repressive method against tax avoidance are being used in case law. With the use of the method a higher level of understanding of the area of tax avoidance can be ob-tained, together with a higher grade of predictability in situations of tax avoidance and simi-lar situations. The court also conforms to the tax avoidance act on the situation. This con-form is of fundamental importance as it gives guidance of the appliance of the tax avoid-ance act. What have been investigated and concluded is that the courts judgment in the case RÅ 2009 ref 47 : 2 cannot be regarded as contradictory to the principle of legal security. As the court both has legislative support in the act of tax avoidance {{as well as in the}} case law, I find their decision as from an objective perspective legally correct. 7 However in the judgment it is unfortunate that the court in their motivation to their deci-sion lacks certain information. That is the kind of additional information that could be meaningful in order to predict future judgments by the court within the area...|$|R
