(plug adaptors and block adaptors) Plug adaptors are rated for 232/240 bar, and can only be used with valves which are designed to accept them. Block adaptors are generally rated for 200 bar, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> almost any 200 bar DIN valve.|$|E
5|$|Arrays {{can contain}} {{elements}} {{of any type}} that PHP can handle, including resources, objects, and other arrays. Order is preserved in lists of values and in hashes with both keys and values, and the two can be intermingled. PHP also supports strings, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> single quotes, double quotes, nowdoc or heredoc syntax.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> {{the aim of}} curing {{the cancer}} in cases of small or locally {{advanced}} tumours, provided the cancer has not metastasized (spread {{to other parts of}} the body). In appropriately selected cases, brachytherapy for primary tumours often represents a comparable approach to surgery, achieving the same probability of cure and with similar side effects.|$|E

5|$|PHP 5 {{introduced}} {{private and}} protected member variables and methods, along with abstract classes, final classes, abstract methods, and final methods. It also introduced a standard way of declaring constructors and destructors, {{similar to that}} of other object-oriented languages such as C++, and a standard exception handling model. Furthermore, PHP 5 added interfaces and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. Objects implementing ArrayAccess <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> array syntax and objects implementing Iterator or IteratorAggregate <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> the foreach language construct. There is no virtual table feature in the engine, so static variables are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time.|$|E
5|$|These values <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> {{standard}} {{open circuit}} decompression tables, {{but are not}} applicable with constant oxygen partial pressure as provided by closed circuit rebreathers. Tables are used with the sea level equivalent depth and stops are done at the altitude stop depth.|$|E
5|$|In Cold Blood is a 3D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Via a direct control interface, the player guides John Cord's movements with a keyboard or gamepad. Cord must collect objects that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> other collectible objects, {{parts of the}} scenery, or {{other people in the}} game world to solve puzzles and progress in the game. Cord can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. Action scenes are also included.|$|E

5|$|Xenon has {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 72% at age 40, making it 44% more potent than N2O as an anesthetic. Thus, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> oxygen in concentrations {{that have a}} lower risk of hypoxia. Unlike nitrous oxide (N2O), xenon is not a greenhouse gas and is viewed as environmentally friendly. Though recycled in modern systems, xenon vented to the atmosphere is only returning to its original source, without environmental impact.|$|E
5|$|Adventure 2 has {{the health}} system found in many other Sonic games. The player {{collects}} rings scattered throughout the levels; being hit by an enemy while holding rings causes the player to drop them all, while being hit without rings causes them to lose a life. Tails and Eggman have the customary health bar, which is slowly refilled by collecting rings. Dying with no lives results in a game over screen. The characters can obtain permanent upgrades that grant them new abilities; for example, one allows Sonic and Shadow to dash along a sequential trail of rings to reach distant platforms, while another lets Knuckles and Rouge attack powerfully enough to break certain containers. Chaos Drives <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> the player's Chao (small, anthropomorphic animals).|$|E
5|$|Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist George Stobbart through the game's world and {{interacts with the}} environment by selecting from multiple commands, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character in selected portions of the game. The player controls George's movements and actions with a mouse (PC and PlayStation), or a gamepad (PlayStation). Player can collect objects that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be}} done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player uses a map to travel, and new locations are added to it as the story unfolds. By right clicking on an object, the player gets a description and clues. The player character's death is possible if the player makes a wrong decision.|$|E

5|$|Broken Sword: The Angel of Death uses both a {{point and}} click and direct control interface. The player guides George Stobbart's {{movements}} with a mouse or keyboard, and Nicole Collard {{is also a}} playable character in selected portions of the game. George must collect objects that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or {{other people in the}} game world to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in the first three Broken Sword games, the death of the player character is possible in The Angel of Death.|$|E
5|$|For many {{practical}} purposes, {{light and}} other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. In communicating with distant space probes, {{it can take}} minutes to hours for a message to get from Earth to the spacecraft, or vice versa. The light seen from stars left them many years ago, allowing {{the study of the}} history of the universe by looking at distant objects. The finite speed of light also limits the theoretical maximum speed of computers, since information must be sent within the computer from chip to chip. The speed of light <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> time of flight measurements to measure large distances to high precision.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{a sequel}} titled BoxBoxBoy! was {{released}} for the Nintendo 3DS, allowing Qbby to create {{two sets of}} boxes at a time. The game was announced and released in Japan on January 6, 2016, and in other terrorities on June 30, 2016. A third game, titled Bye-Bye BoxBoy!, was released 2017. The game adds new kinds of boxes, such as explosive bombs and rocket propelled boxes, as well as box children {{that need to be}} escorted safely through levels. A physical compilation of all three games, titled , was also released in Japan the same day. The compilation also included a soundtrack CD featuring the music from all three games, as well as a Qbby Amiibo figure, the latter of which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> Goodbye! BoxBoy!.|$|E

5|$|Mission {{objectives}} vary {{in quantity}} and length {{depending on the}} difficulty setting chosen. Difficulty settings also affect enemy accuracy and damage, {{and the availability of}} the game's optional automatic aiming assistance. The player can use several weapons, including pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, and a rocket launcher. Weapons must be reloaded after a certain number of shots and have alternate fire modes. For example, the Wolfram P2K <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> or without a silencer. In addition, the player always carries a wristwatch which may be used to stun enemies, fire tranquilizer darts, throw a grappling hook, or emit a laser beam to open locks. In some missions, the player can also use night vision or X-ray vision glasses to outsmart enemies. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. There are no health-recovery items in the game, although body armors can be acquired to provide a secondary health bar. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak is required to save the player's progress through the game.|$|E
5|$|PHP is a {{general-purpose}} {{scripting language}} that is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. Any PHP code in a requested file is executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on websites or elsewhere. It {{can also be used}} for command-line scripting and client-side graphical user interface (GUI) applications. PHP can be deployed on most web servers, many operating systems and platforms, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> many relational database management systems (RDBMS). Most web hosting providers support PHP for use by their clients. It is available free of charge, and the PHP Group provides the complete source code for users to build, customize and extend for their own use.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon is {{a departure}} from previous instalments in the series, using a direct control interface. The player guides George Stobbart's movements with a keyboard or gamepad, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character at certain times. George must collect objects that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> other collectable objects, parts of the scenery, or {{other people in the}} game world in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player has action choices in the bottom right of the screen - there are four circles with anywhere from one to four actions available at any time; the player selects the desired action with the corresponding key. As in the first two Broken Sword games, in The Sleeping Dragon player character death is possible.|$|E
