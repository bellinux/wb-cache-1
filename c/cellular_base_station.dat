Balancing of these modes while reducing {{the capital and}} operational costs are of prime importance.  Cost efficient and reliable supply of electricity for mobile phone <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> must be ensured while expanding the mobile phone network.

40|$|This review paper, {{takes into}} account {{previously}} published papers based on human exposure to electromagnetic fields which is radiated from <b>cellular</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> and its corresponding adverse effects on human beings. This paper reviews the estimation and evaluation of the human exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF); these radiated fields from <b>cellular</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> which aim to verify the exposure compliance with human protection guidelines. There is an abundant literature in which experiments are carried out to study what effects the radiated fields have when human cells are exposed to such exposure. Here exposure situation considered is around the <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> and the approximate distance from <b>base</b> <b>station</b> is from 5 m to 150 m. Different exposure measurement methods were used in different papers such as single point measurement method or spatial averaging methods, such as 3, 6, 9, 20 points. Selected countries in Europe and elsewhere has taken the EMF exposure survey and compared the results with guidelines developed by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).

5000|$|Space diversity: The {{signal is}} {{transmitted}} over several different propagation paths. In {{the case of}} wired transmission, this {{can be achieved by}} transmitting via multiple wires. In the case of wireless transmission, it can be achieved by antenna diversity using multiple transmitter antennas (transmit diversity) and/or multiple receiving antennas (reception diversity). In the latter case, a diversity combining technique is applied before further signal processing takes place. If the antennas are far apart, for example at different <b>cellular</b> <b>base</b> <b>station</b> sites or WLAN access points, this is called macrodiversity or site diversity. If the antennas are at a distance in the order of one wavelength, this is called microdiversity.
