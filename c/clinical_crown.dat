40|$|When the <b>clinical</b> <b>crowns</b> {{of teeth}} are {{dimensionally}} inadequate, esthetically and biologically acceptable restoration of these dental units is difficult. Often an acceptable restoration cannot be accomplished without first surgically increasing {{the length of}} the existing clinical crowns; therefore, successful management requires an understanding of both the dental and periodontal parameters of treatment. The complications presented by teeth with short <b>clinical</b> <b>crowns</b> demand a comprehensive treatment plan and proper sequencing of therapy to ensure a satisfactory result. Visualization of the desired result is a prerequisite of successful therapy. This review examines the periodontal and restorative factors related to restoring teeth with short <b>clinical</b> <b>crowns.</b> Modes of therapy are usually combined to meet the biologic, restorative, and esthetic requirements imposed by short <b>clinical</b> <b>crowns.</b> In this study various methods for treating short <b>clinical</b> <b>crowns</b> are reviewed, the role that restoration margin location play in the maintenance of periodontal and dental symbiosis and the effects of violation of the supracrestal gingivae by improper full-coverage restorations has also been discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Excessive {{display of}} gum tissue during smiling is called gummy smile. This {{situation}} {{is caused by}} several factors including altered passive eruption. The purpose of this investigation {{is to determine the}} correlation between gummy smile and altered passive eruption (APE) in a young population of women in Esfahan. Materials and Methods: In this cross sectional study, 842 females aged between 20 and 30 were examined in Esfahan. They were asked to smile in voluntary and involuntary (emotional) states. Gingival display (more than 1 mm during smiling) as well as length of the <b>clinical</b> <b>crowns</b> (short or normal) in anterior teeth were recorded in a table. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using chi square. Results: Results revealed that 223 subjects exhibited short <b>clinical</b> <b>crowns</b> and 619 had normal <b>clinical</b> <b>crowns.</b> Gummy smile was reported in 128 subjects during voluntary state and in 556 subjects in involuntary state. 148 subject didn’t have gummy smile. Chi square analysis showed a correlation between short <b>clinical</b> <b>crowns</b> and the type of smile. In voluntary state, gummy smile was seen in 22. 4 % of the subjects with short <b>clinical</b> <b>crowns</b> and in 12. 6 % of the subjects with normal crown length (P< 0. 001 (Involuntary smiling resulted in gingival display in 68. 6 % of the subjects with short <b>clinical</b> <b>crowns</b> and in 66. 7 % with normal crown length (p= 0. 61).

However, the gingival margin-papillae measurement was not affected by tooth wear and gave a true positive result for gingival recession. Tooth wear (attrition) {{was not associated with}} an increase in gingival recession. These measures are also useful in detecting recession prior to cemental exposure. Measures for recession and tooth wear were different for the four demographic groups studied.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of different post lengths upon root fracture resistance. Methods: 78 maxillary central teeth with similar dimensions were mounted in acrylic blocks with artificial silicone periodontal ligaments. Combinations of post lengths of 6 mm (shorter than 1 / 1 <b>clinical</b> <b>crown</b> length), 9 mm (1 / 1 <b>clinical</b> <b>crown</b> length), and 12 mm (longer than 1 / 1 <b>clinical</b> <b>crown</b> length) made up 6 different groups consisting of 13 teeth each. The glass fiber posts (Snowpost) were cemented with Super-Bond C&B and Panavia F luting cement. Composite-resin cores were made with Clearfil PhotoCore. The specimens were tested in a universal test machine. The testing machine applied controlled loads to the core, 2 mm from its incisal edge, on the palatal side at an angle 135 degrees to the long axis of the root. The testing machine was set at a crosshead speed of 5 mm per minute. All samples were loaded until failure. Results: There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between cements (P>. 05).

40|$|This review {{deals with}} the {{different}} methods of lengthening the <b>clinical</b> <b>crown</b> and discusses the advantages and/or disadvantages of each method. Different flap procedures, including ostectomy and osteoplasty, reduce {{the height of the}} alveolar crest aiming at a distance of about 3 mm to a future reconstruction margin. Root planing may avoid reattachment of surgically separated fibers. Other methods like gingivectomy, electrosurgery, intra-alveolar transplantation, and forced eruption might contain considerable biological disadvantages. However, if the extrusion is combined with regular fiberotomy, this method becomes the most conservative with respect to the periodontal tissues of neighboring teeth. On the other hand, not all situations which require lengthening of the <b>clinical</b> <b>crown</b> can be solved by orthodontic extrusion and fiberotomy. Therefore, depending on the clinical problem, either the surgical lengthening of the <b>clinical</b> <b>crown</b> or the orthodontic extrusion with separation of the fibers are the recommended procedures. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background: Well-finished {{orthodontic}} treatment begins with accurate {{positioning of the}} brackets on the teeth. Aims: To compare the positions of orthodontic brackets placed by experienced clinicians and inexperienced trainees. Methods: Twenty orthodontists (13 male, 7 female) representing experienced specialists, and 20 final year dental students (10 male, 10 female) representing inexperienced trainees, were asked to bond pre-adjusted straight-wire brackets at the centres of the <b>clinical</b> <b>crowns</b> of the teeth in a Class I crowded typodont set-up. The teeth {{were removed from the}} typodont, placed in a standardised jig and photographed. The vertical, mesio-distal and angular (tip) positions of the brackets, relative to the centres of the <b>clinical</b> <b>crowns,</b> were measured with the aid of imaging software. The accuracy of bracket placement by the groups was compared. Results: The dental students took significantly longer than orthodontists to place the brackets (50. 65 ± 16. 33 minutes vs 28. 53 ± 9. 51 minutes, p 0. 05). Both groups tended to bond the brackets with a distal tip. The students had slightly more right-left differences than the orthodontists. Mesio-distal errors in bracket placement were associated with rotated and displaced teeth.

40|$|Introduction: A short <b>clinical</b> <b>crown</b> {{may lead}} to poor {{retention}} form thereby leading to improper tooth preparation. Surgical crown lengthening procedure is done to increase the <b>clinical</b> <b>crown</b> length without violating the biologic width. Several techniques have been proposed for <b>clinical</b> <b>crown</b> lengthening which includes gingivectomy, apically displaced flap with or without resective osseous surgery, and surgical extrusion using periotome. Objective: The aim {{of this paper is}} to compare clinically the three different surgical techniques of crown lengthening procedures. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients who reported to the department of Periodontology, were included in the study. Patients were randomly divided into three groups, which include patients who underwent gingivectomy (Group A), apically repositioned flap (Group B) and surgical extrusion using periotome (Group C). Clinical measurements such as <b>clinical</b> <b>crown</b> length, gingival zenith, interdental papilla height were taken at baseline and at 3 rd month post-operatively. Results: Clinical and radiographic evaluation at 3 rd month suggest that surgical extrusion technique offers several advantages over the other conventional surgical techniques such as preservation of the interproximal papilla, gingival margin position and no marginal bone loss. Conclusions: This technique can be used to successfully treat a grossly damaged crown structure as a result of tooth fracture, dental caries and iatrogenic factors especially in the anterior region, where esthetics is of great concern...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Rapid {{prototyping}} is a fast-developing {{technique that}} might {{play a significant}} role in the eventual replacement of plaster dental models. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy and reproducibility of physical dental models reconstructed from digital data by several rapid prototyping techniques. METHODS: Twelve mandibular and maxillary conventional plaster models from randomly chosen subjects were selected and served as the gold standard. The plaster models were scanned to form high-resolution 3 -dimensional surface models in. stl files. These files were converted into physical models using 3 rapid prototyping techniques: digital light processing, jetted photopolymer, and 3 -dimensional printing. Linear measurements on the plaster models were compared with linear measurements on the rapid prototyping models. One observer measured the height and width of the <b>clinical</b> <b>crowns</b> of all teeth (first molar to first molar) on all models (plaster and replicas) using a digital caliper. All models were measured 5 times with a 2 -week interval between measurements. RESULTS: The intraobserver agreement was high (intraclass correlation coefficient > 0. 94). The mean systematic differences for the measurements of the height of the <b>clinical</b> <b>crowns</b> were - 0. 02 mm for the jetted photopolymer models, 0. 04 mm for the digital light processing models, and 0. 25 mm for the 3 -dimensional printing models. For the width of the teeth, the mean systematic differences were - 0. 08 mm for the jetted photopolymer models, - 0. 05 mm for the digital light processing models, and - 0. 05 mm for the 3 -dimensional printing models. CONCLUSIONS: Dental models reconstructed by the tested rapid prototyping techniques are considered clinically acceptable in terms of accuracy and reproducibility and might be appropriate for selected applications in orthodontics...|$|R
