40|$|Much {{previous}} work on how normal aging affects visual enumeration {{has been focused}} on the response time required to enumerate, with unlimited stimulus duration. There is a fundamental question, not yet addressed, of how many visual items the aging visual system can enumerate in a "single glance", without the confounding influence of eye movements. We recruited 104 observers with normal vision across the age span (age 21 - 85). They were briefly (200 ms) presented with a number of well- separated black dots against a gray background on a monitor screen, and were asked to judge the number of dots. By limiting the stimulus presentation time, we can determine the maximum number of visual items an observer can <b>correctly</b> <b>enumerate</b> at a criterion level of performance (counting threshold, defined as the number of visual items at which ≈ 63 % correct rate on a psychometric curve), without confounding by eye movements. Our findings reveal a 30 % decrease in the mean counting threshold of the oldest group (age 61 - 85 : ∼ 5 dots) when compared with the youngest groups (age 21 - 40 : 7 dots). Surprisingly, despite decreased counting threshold, on average counting accuracy function (defined as the mean number of dots reported for each number tested) is largely unaffected by age, reflecting that the threshold loss can be primarily attributed to increased random errors. We further expanded this interesting finding to show that both young and old adults tend to over-count small numbers, but older observers over-count more. Here we show that age reduces the ability to <b>correctly</b> <b>enumerate</b> in a glance, but the accuracy (veridicality), on average, remains unchanged with advancing age. Control experiments indicate that the degraded performance cannot be explained by optical, retinal or other perceptual factors, but is cortical in origin...|$|R
40|$|Exhaustive and nonredundant {{generating}} stereoisomers of {{a chemical}} compound with a specified constitution {{is one of the}} important tools for molecular structure elucidation and molecular design. In this paper we deal with chemical compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen atoms whose graphical structures are outerplanar, and consider stereoisomers caused only by asymmetry around carbon atoms. It is known that many chemical compounds have outerplanar graph structures. Based on dynamic programming, we propose an algorithm of generating all stereoisomers without duplication. We treat a given outerplanar graph as a graph rooted at its structural center. Our algorithm first computes recursively the numbers of stereoisomers of the subgraph induced by the descendants of each vertex, and then constructs each stereoisomer by backtracking the process of computing the numbers of stereoisomers. Our algorithm correctly counts the number of stereoisomers in O(n) time and <b>correctly</b> <b>enumerates</b> all the stereoisomers in O(n 3) time per stereoisomer on average, where n is the number of atoms in a given structure...|$|R

In this paper, we deal with chemical compounds composed of carbon, hy-drogen, oxygen and nitrogen atoms whose graphical structures are tree-like graphs because these compounds are most fundamental, and consider stereoisomers that can be generated by asymmetric carbon atoms and double bonds between two adjacent carbon atoms. Based on dynamic programming, we propose an algorithm of generating all stereoisomers without duplication. We treat a given tree-like graph as a tree rooted at its structural center.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} awareness of the multiple ways that bacteriophages (phages) influence bacterial evolution, population dynamics, physiology and pathogenicity. By studying a novel group of phages infecting a soil borne pathogen, we revealed a paradigm shifting observation that the phages switch their lifestyle according to temperature. We sampled soil from an endemic area of the serious tropical pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, and established that podoviruses infecting the pathogen are frequently present in soil, {{and many of them}} are naturally occurring variants of a common virus type. Experiments on one phage in the related model Burkholderia thailandensis demonstrated that temperature defines the outcome of phage-bacteria interactions. At higher temperatures (37 °C), the phage predominantly goes through a lytic cycle, but at lower temperatures (25 °C), the phage remains temperate. This is the first report of a naturally occurring phage that follows a lytic or temperate lifestyle according to temperature. These observations fundamentally alter the accepted views on the abundance, population biology and virulence of B. pseudomallei. Furthermore, when taken together with previous studies, our findings suggest that the phenomenon of temperature dependency in phages is widespread. Such phages are likely to have a profound effect on bacterial life, and on our ability to culture and <b>correctly</b> <b>enumerate</b> viable bacteria...|$|R

While exploratory surveys depending on fishing trials alone are very time-consuming and expensive, and at best can only provide information about the distribution and abundance of the fish which are vulnerable to the type of fishing gear and method of fishing applied, the modern calibrated, highly sensitive acoustic instruments provide the under-water vision required to <b>enumerate</b> <b>correctly</b> and even to size the fish present in practically the entire water column...|$|R

There were at least fifteen different species which nothing short of an ichthyologist could <b>enumerate</b> <b>correctly.</b> The line used by Moses was a single fibre of bark almost as strong as gut; the hook was a white tinned weapon like a small anchor, supplied by traders, and meant originally for service in the deep sea. The bait was nothing in particular, but, as the fish were not particular, that was of no consequence. The reader will not be surprised, then, when we state that {{in an hour or}} so Moses had had his heart progged considerably and had filled a large bag with superb fish, with which he returned, perspiring, beaming, and triumphant to breakfast.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} trend of {{performing}} analysis on large datasets using workflows composed of MapReduce jobs connected through producer-consumer relationships based on data. This trend has spurred {{the development of a}} number of interfaces [...] ranging from program-based to query-based interfaces [...] for generating MapReduce workflows. Studies have shown that the gap in performance can be quite large between optimized and unoptimized workflows. However, automatic cost-based optimization of MapReduce workflows remains a challenge due to the multitude of interfaces, large size of the execution plan space, and the frequent unavailability of all types of information needed for optimization. We introduce a comprehensive plan space for MapReduce workflows generated by popular workflow generators. We then propose Stubby, a cost-based optimizer that searches selectively through the subspace of the full plan space that can be <b>enumerated</b> <b>correctly</b> and costed based on the information available in any given setting. Stubby enumerates the plan space based on plan-to-plan transformations and an efficient search algorithm. Stubby is designed to be extensible to new interfaces and new types of optimizations, which is a desirable feature given how rapidly MapReduce systems are evolving. Stubby's efficiency and effectiveness have been evaluated using representative workflows from many domains. Comment: VLDB 201...|$|R
40|$|Estimating the {{abundance}} of cetaceans from aerial survey data requires careful attention to survey design and analysis. Once an aerial observer perceives a marine mammal or group of marine mammals, {{he or she has}} only a few seconds to identify and enumerate the individuals sighted, as well as to determine the distance to the sighting and record this information. In line-transect survey analyses, it is assumed that the observer has <b>correctly</b> identified and <b>enumerated</b> the group or individual. We describe methods used to test this assumption and how survey data should be adjusted to account for observer errors. Harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) were censused during aerial surveys in the summer of 1997 in Southeast Alaska (9844 km survey effort), in the summer of 1998 in the Gulf of Alaska (10, 127 km), and in the summer of 1999 in the Bering Sea (7849 km). Sightings of harbor porpoise during a beluga whale (Phocoena phocoena) survey in 1998 (1355 km) provided data on harbor porpoise abundance in Cook Inlet for the Gulf of Alaska stock. Sightings by primary observers at side windows were compared to an independent observer at a belly window to estimate the probability of misidentification, underestimation of group size, and the probability that porpoise on the surface at the trackline were missed (perception bias, g(0)). There were 129, 96, and 201 sightings of harbor porpoises in the three stock areas, respectively. Both g(0) and effective strip width (the realized width of the survey track) depended on survey year, and g(0) also depended on the visibility reported by observers. Harbor porpoise abundance in 1997 – 99 was estimated at 11, 146 animals for the Southeast Alaska stock, 31, 046 animals for the Gulf of Alaska stock, and 48, 515 animals for the Bering Sea stock...|$|R
40|$|Artificial neural {{networks}} (ANNs) combined with automated image processing are bring {{used in a}} growing number of applications, ranging from car license plate identification to speech recognition. ANN analysis is capable of handling complicated images that cannot be dealt with using conventional image filters, such;as images originating from yeasts and bacteria adhering on turbid solids (silicone rubber or dental enamel) or metals. In this paper, a feed-forward ANN processing greyvalues from a 9 x 9 pixel microscope subimage, is presented for the image enhancement and subsequent enumeration of microorganisms adhering to solid substrata. The ANN developed is a simple software routine that can be implemented as a digital image filter in existing software and assists in locating the positions of adhering microorganisms. In order to evaluate the performance of the ANN, adhesion experiments were carried out in a parallel plate flow chamber with Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococcus epidermidis, and polystyrene latex particles to different solid substrata under ideal and subideal illumination and focus of the microscope setup. The performance of the ANN-based enumerations was compared with the performance of nonneural, conventional image-processing methods and visual enumeration. For high-contrast images, nearly all, of the adhering organisms can be detected correctly after conventional image filtering. However, in the lower quality images which were employed in this study, for metal or silicons rubber substrate, image enhancement by the ANN yielded enumeration of the adhering bacteria with an accuracy of 93 %- 98 %, while using conventional image filters, an accuracy of 86 - 96 % was achieved. Adhering yeasts could be enumerated after conventional image filtering with an accuracy of 92 %, but after ANN enhancement, 98 % of the yeast cells adhering on silicone rubber substrata were <b>enumerated</b> <b>correctly.</b> It can be concluded that fur low quality and complicated images, ANNs perform better than conventional filters, while as additional advantages, the training of an ANN requires significantly less expert knowledge than optimal setting of conventional image filters, and an ANN can be used to distinguish between strains in adhesion experiments involving more than one strain.
