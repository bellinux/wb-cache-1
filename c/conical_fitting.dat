40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} {{machining}} and measuring conical surfaces with great accuracy is a challenging current subject in engineering. Cutting edge methods which measure the conicity and form errors of manufactured conical parts are accurate but involve high-costs equipments. New, accurate, practical and economical measuring instruments {{should be developed}} and to this end, the paper proposes some simple yet precise measuring devices. The paper presents the geometrical elements concerning a <b>conical</b> <b>fitting</b> that {{may be useful in}} designing and manufacturing diverse external taper measurements devices. The basic principles to be considered are determined and the minimum essential notions in designing the devices are presented. The calibrated rings method is considered and mechanical or digital callipers will be used in developing the devices...|$|E

Improvements in the characterisation of materials used in pipes, tubes or vessels rely on the development of tests on cylindrical samples in order to be consistent with the real manufacturing process. Existing devices are unable to reach the pressure limits required to test high pressure hydrogen storage tanks. We therefore propose an original test device based on a <b>conical</b> <b>ﬁtting</b> system. First, the operational principle and the pressure measurement technique are presented. Next, the choice of apparatus design parameters according to test requirements is discussed. In addition, the device’s capabilities are illustrated on a 39 mm thick CFRP ring test including Digital Image Correlation measurements...|$|E
40|$|The Micro Conical System (MCS) is a three-part, {{multi-purpose}} {{mechanical interface}} system used for acquiring and manipulating masses on-orbit by either extravehicular activity (EVA) or telerobotic means. The three {{components of the}} system are the micro <b>conical</b> <b>fitting</b> (MCF), the EVA micro tool (EMCT), and the Robot Micro Conical Tool (RMCT). The MCS was developed and refined over a four-year period. This period culminated with the delivery of 358 Class 1 and Class 2 micro conical fittings for the International Space Station and with its first use in space to handle a 1272 kg (2800 lbm) Spartan satellite (11000 {{times greater than the}} MCF mass) during an EVA aboard STS- 63 in February, 1995. The micro conical system is the first successful EVA/robot-compatible mechanism to be demonstrated in the external environment aboard the U. S. Space Shuttle...|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} farming harvesting {{is done by}} <b>fitting</b> <b>conical</b> nets on the {{sluice gates}} and opening them during low tide. The shrimp are trapped in the net as the water recedes. The remaining shrimp are harvested by cast netting. In semi-intensive and intensive practices, harvesting is done by complete draining of the pond. The rest of the shrimp are collected by hand.|$|R
50|$|When {{smoking a}} chillum a chillum stone is often {{inserted}} in the pipe to keep from directly inhaling debris much like a screen or filter is used in other pipes. They are generally tight <b>fitting,</b> <b>conical</b> with a flat top and usually have a small hole drilled down through the centre and slits down the sides to allow smoke to pass freely. Before they were commercially available people would search for the right sized pebble off the ground to fit their pipes. Some still do.|$|R
40|$|Design {{eliminates}} {{thermal stress}} between composite cap and metal piston. New, conically surfaced, composite piston-cap structure, passively retained in metallic piston, made from carbon/carbon material, machined to shape. Shape includes conical faces, conical extensions intersect at common vertex on cylindrical axis of piston body, allowing thermal-stress-free retention of cap at all temperatures. When assembly heated or cooled, metal expands or contracts radially from coincident vertex. Where metal makes contact with carbon/carbon cap, snugly <b>fitting</b> <b>conical</b> faces slide without interference. Since metal body free to expand, no thermal stress produced in metal body or carbon/carbon cap...|$|R
40|$|Using the Multi-Reference Configuration Interaction method, the {{adiabatic}} {{potential energy}} surfaces of Li 3 are computed. The two lowest electronic states are bound and exhibit a <b>conical</b> intersection. By <b>fitting</b> the calculated potential energy surfaces to the cubic Exe Jahn-Teller model we extract the effective Jahn-Teller parameters corresponding to Li 3. These {{are used to}} set up the transformation matrix which transforms from the adiabatic to a diabatic representation. This diabatization method gives a Hamiltonian for Li 3 which is free from singular adiabatic couplings and should be accurate for large internuclear distances, and it thereby allows for bound dynamics {{in the vicinity of the}} conical intersection to be explored.

5000|$|In 1888 the Hohenzollern Locomotive Works {{delivered}} {{the first two}} narrow gauge [...] Feldbahn locomotives for the Prussian Army. These used a conical development of the launch boiler. A backplate of enlarged diameter and a greatly reduced smokebox tubeplate were fitted into a steeply conical shell. This was installed with the upper edge of the cone horizontal. The purpose of the conical shape was to increase water depth over the furnace, the hottest part of the evaporative surface. The furnace and tubes were moved to {{the lower part of}} the shell, with the tubes running upwards parallel to the lower edge of the cone. A difficulty was the boiler's lack of steam space, requiring an enlarged dome, of almost as much capacity as the main shell. As a major virtue of the launch boiler is the simplicity of its construction, rolling a <b>conical</b> shell and <b>fitting</b> a large dome represented a considerable increase in their complexity and cost.|$|R
