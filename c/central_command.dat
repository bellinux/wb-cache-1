His assignment included multiple trips to the Coalition Intelligence Center in Iraq where he worked on Detainee Interrogation Release Parameters.|$|E
5|$|Hours after Ambassador Bishop's {{visit to}} <b>Central</b> <b>Command,</b> Iraq invaded Kuwait. In 1979, the US {{negotiated}} {{access to an}} airport and port in both Mogadishu and Berbera; because of limited access the US had to locations in the Persian Gulf area, maintaining this access was a main interest for the Mogadishu embassy to pursue as the US mobilized to intervene in Kuwait.|$|E

5|$|Assuming {{command of}} United States <b>Central</b> <b>Command</b> in 1988, Schwarzkopf was {{called on to}} respond to the Invasion of Kuwait in 1990 by the forces of Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Initially tasked with {{defending}} Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm—an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive—which defeated the Iraqi Army and liberated Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{sent the}} invading Iraqi forces into {{neighboring}} Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq {{as part of}} its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation. An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border. The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. <b>Central</b> <b>Command,</b> headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, {{detailed}} invasion {{plans were}} {{drawn up by}} the Germans, but Switzerland was never attacked. Switzerland was able to remain independent {{through a combination of}} military deterrence, concessions to Germany, and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion. Under General Henri Guisan <b>central</b> <b>command,</b> a general mobilisation of the armed forces was ordered. The Swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland, to one of organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the Alps known as the Reduit. Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers.|$|E
5|$|Hananu's {{subordinate}} {{officers and}} rank-and-file fighters were all Sunni Muslims, but were ethnically heterogeneous. Hananu {{himself was a}} Kurd as were field commanders Najib Uwaid and Abdullah ibn Umar, while Umar al-Bitar was an Arab and field commander Sha'ban Agha was a Turk. The ′isabat led by al-Bitar and al-Qassam were dominated by Arabs. The localized nature of the revolt reflected the rebels' sense of defending their homeland and community. Despite the eventual organization of the revolt and coordination between rebel commanders for major military decisions, most political decisions and military operations were local initiatives. As such, al-Sa'dun referred to the revolt in the plural as thawrat al-Shimal (Northern revolts) rather than the singular thawra, and referred to {{the leadership of the}} revolt as the plural quwwad al-thawra rather than qiyadat al-thawra, which refers to a <b>central</b> <b>command.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1948, when Australia's {{part-time}} {{military force}} was re-raised as the Citizens Military Force (CMF), the 10th Battalion {{returned to the}} order of battle, readopting the designation of The Adelaide Rifles. Throughout the 1950s, as part of <b>Central</b> <b>Command,</b> the battalion provided training for national servicemen until 1960, when a widespread re-organisation of the CMF saw the creation of six state-based multi-battalion regiments as the smaller, regional regiments of the past were consolidated. As a result, the 10th Battalion was subsumed into the pentropic 1st Battalion, Royal South Australia Regiment, providing two companies: 'D' (The Adelaide Company) and 'E' (The Port Adelaide Company). In 1961, the battalion, although technically off the Army's order of battle, was entrusted with the 12 battle honours that had been earned by the 2/10th Battalion during World War II.|$|E

5|$|In a {{television}} report taped and broadcast {{shortly after the}} bombing, Tuđman said that the attack {{appears to have been}} meant to destroy the Banski dvori as the seat of the statehood of Croatia, and as a decapitation strike. He concluded with statements of resolve to end foreign occupation and rebuild the nation. Marković telephoned his office in Belgrade blaming Yugoslav Defence Secretary General Veljko Kadijević for the attack. He demanded his resignation, threatening not to return to Belgrade until Kadijević was out of office. The Yugoslav Defence Ministry brushed away the accusation, claiming that the attack was not authorized by the <b>central</b> <b>command</b> and suggesting that the event might have been stage-managed by the Croatian authorities. The Yugoslav military later suggested that Croatian leadership planted plastic explosives in the Banski dvori.|$|E
5|$|Operation Iraqi Freedom {{began on}} 20 March 2003. Sixty OA-10/A-10 {{aircraft}} {{took part in}} early combat there. United States Air Forces <b>Central</b> <b>Command</b> issued Operation Iraqi Freedom: By the Numbers, a declassified report about the aerial campaign in the conflict on 30 April 2003. During that initial invasion of Iraq, A-10s had a mission capable rate of 85 percent in the war and fired 311,597 rounds of 30mm ammunition. A single A-10 was shot down near Baghdad International Airport by Iraqi fire late in the campaign. The A-10 also flew 32 missions in which the aircraft dropped propaganda leaflets over Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Portions of JSOC {{units have}} made up the {{constantly}} changing special operations task force, operating in the U.S. <b>Central</b> <b>Command</b> area of operations. The Task Force 11, Task Force 121, Task Force 6-26 and Task Force 145 are creations of the Pentagon's post-11 September campaign against terrorism, and it quickly became the model for how the military would gain intelligence and battle insurgents in the future. Originally known as Task Force 121, it was formed {{in the summer of}} 2003, when the military merged two existing Special Operations units, one hunting Osama bin Laden in and around Afghanistan, and the other tracking Sadaam Hussein in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|<b>Central</b> Area <b>Command</b> was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. It was formed in March 1940, and covered the central portion of New South Wales. Headquartered at Sydney, <b>Central</b> Area <b>Command</b> was primarily responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries. It was disbanded in August 1941 and control of its units taken over by other RAAF formations. Proposals in 1943–44 to raise a new <b>Central</b> Area <b>Command</b> did not come to fruition.|$|R

5|$|Re d'Italia {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the Italian fleet until moments before the Battle of Lissa on 20 July 1866; Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano's hasty transfer to another vessel deprived the fleet of <b>central</b> <b>command,</b> and in the ensuing melee, Re d'Italia was rammed and sunk. Re di Portogallo was also rammed, but was not seriously damaged and she survived the action. The ship remained in service until 1871, when she became a training ship; this service did not last long, as the green wood used to build her hull had badly deteriorated by 1875, so she was sold and broken up for scrap that year.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 28 January, the Coalition {{received}} {{a number of}} warnings suggesting an impending Iraqi offensive. The Coalition was flying two brand-new E-8A Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) aircraft, which picked up the deployment and movement of Iraqi forces to the area opposite of Khafji. Observation posts 2, 7 and 8 also detected heavy Iraqi reconnoitering along the border, and their small teams of air-naval gunfire liaison Marines called in air and artillery strikes throughout the day. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Barry, commander of the forward headquarters of the 1st Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Intelligence Group, sent warnings about an impending attack to <b>Central</b> <b>Command.</b> CentCom leaders were too preoccupied with the air campaign to heed them however, and so the Iraqi operation came as a surprise.|$|E
5|$|After Desert Storm, {{the army}} {{struggled}} with military operations other than war, such as peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations. The school and its graduates examined the situations in Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia. Graduates {{also participated in}} Defense Support of Civil authorities missions. The course continued {{to change in the}} 1990s. Under Colonel Gregory Fontenot, the school moved from Fort Leavenworth's Flint Hall to Eisenhower Hall in October 1994. In later years, the school's leadership expanded the number of seminars and the civilian faculty. The military continues to draw heavily on SAMS in the twenty-first century. SAMS planners have {{played a significant role in}} the Global War on Terror. Beginning in 2002, the United States <b>Central</b> <b>Command</b> requested planners from SAMS and its sister schools, the United States Air Force's School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS), which was designed to be similar to SAMS, and the United States Marine Corps's School of Advanced Warfighting (SAW). SAMS students from the 2002 and 2003 classes participated as planners in the preparations for the invasion of Iraq and the plan for the post-combat occupation.|$|E

5|$|Centralized {{order and}} {{oversight}} among the revolt's armed participants {{was difficult to}} establish because of the diversity and independence of the rebel factions. A meeting of rebel leaders {{was held in the}} Ghouta village of Saqba on 26 November. Sa'id al-'As accused al-Kharrat and others of plundering in the Ghouta, while al-Kharrat alleged that al-Shallash extorted the residents of al-Midan and the Ghouta town of Douma. The meeting concluded with an agreement to elect a government to replace the French authorities, increase recruitment of the Ghouta's inhabitants, coordinate military operations under a <b>central</b> <b>command,</b> and establish a revolutionary court to execute spies. The meeting also designated the area between the village of Zabdin and north of the Douma-Damascus road as being part of al-Kharrat's zone of operations. Despite his leading role in the rebels' military efforts, al-Kharrat {{was not included in the}} newly formed rebel leadership council, nor were any of al-Bakri's allies. Instead, al-'As served as the rebels' overall head.|$|E
5|$|On 24–25 July, Republican forces {{launched}} {{the last major}} offensive of the war, the Battle of the Ebro. Reconnaissance units of the Condor Legion had noticed a troop build-up, and warned Nationalists forces. The warning went unheeded. Although the Republic gained ground, Republican forces failed {{to gain control of}} Gandesa, with 422 sorties by the Legion having considerable effect. However, tensions in Czechoslovakia and a shortage of pilots in Germany led to the return of 250 pilots from the Legion. Although trained Spaniards made up some of the shortfall, Volkmann complained to <b>central</b> <b>command</b> in Berlin, which led to his recall in September. During the battle, which saw 113 days of fighting, only 10 aircraft were lost (some by accident); the Legion claimed around 100 Republican aircraft. Only five aircrew had been killed, and six captured. Aid from Germany temporarily halted in mid-September. Germany and Nationalist Spain settled the issue of German interests in Spanish mines.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, General Anthony Zinni of <b>Central</b> <b>Command</b> was {{instructed}} to plan attacks on bin Laden's Khost camps, where CIA intelligence indicated bin Laden and other militants would be meeting on August 20, purportedly to plan further attacks against the U.S. Clinton was informed of the plan on August 12 and 14. Participants in the meeting later disagreed {{whether or not the}} intelligence indicated bin Laden would attend the meeting; however, an objective of the attack remained to kill the al-Qaeda leader, and the NSC encouraged the strike regardless of whether bin Laden and his companions were known to be present at Khost. The administration aimed to prevent future al-Qaeda attacks discussed in intercepted communications. As Berger later testified, the operation also sought to damage bin Laden's infrastructure and show the administration's commitment to combating bin Laden. The Khost complex, which was 90 miles southeast of Kabul, also had ideological significance: Bin Laden had fought nearby during the Soviet–Afghan War, and he had given interviews and even held a press conference at the site.|$|E
