When {{it became clear that}} no party would achieve the outright majority needed to form the next government, the three main party leaders made public statements offering to discuss the options for putting together an administration with the other parties. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg called on Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Conservative leader David Cameron to act [...] "in the national interest and not out of narrow party political advantage". However, having stated before the election that the party with the most seats should have the initial say on forming a government, Clegg announced his intention to begin talks with the Conservative Party. Speaking outside the Liberal Democrat headquarters he said: [...] "It is now for the Conservative Party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the national interest." [...] Brown said he intended to play his part in securing [...] "a stable, strong and principled government", and indicated his willingness to speak with both Clegg and Cameron on how to achieve this, saying: [...] "What we have seen are no ordinary election results." [...] But shortly after, Cameron held a press conference at which he invited the Liberal Democrats to talks, saying: [...] "I want to make a big, open and <b>comprehensive</b> <b>offer</b> to the Liberal Democrats. I want us to work together in tackling our country's big and urgent problems - the debt crisis, our deep social problems and our broken political system." ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{modern world}} we live in, {{although}} offers us obvious benefits we enjoy every day, can also overwhelms us through efforts and sacrifices required from us. That is why tourism, which {{can be defined as}} a recreative period for most of us, is in continuous positive evolution and development.

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{trends for}} e-business engineering revolve around specialisation and cooperation. Successful companies {{focus on their}} core competences, and rely on a network of business partners for the support services required to compose a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>offer</b> for their customers. Modulariy is crucial for a flexible e-business infrastructure, but related requirements seldom reflect on the design and operational models of business information systems. Software components are widely used {{for the implementation of}} e-business applications, with proved benefits in terms of system development and maintenance. We propose a service-oriented componentisation of e-business systems as a way to close the gap with the business models they support. Blurring the distinction between external services and internal capabilities, we propose a homogeneous model for the definition of e-business applications components. After a brief discussion on the foundational aspects of the approach, we present the process-based technique we adopted for component modelling. We then present an infrastructure compliant with the model proposed that we built on top of an EJB (Enterprise Java Beans) platform. 1...|$|E
