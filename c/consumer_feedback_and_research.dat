With research indicating consumer reluctance towards the uptake of sustainable or "smart housing", this project was designed to monitor the day-to-day experiences of living in a Smart House. Research House in Rockhampton, Queensland has been a living laboratory over two years (2002 - 2004), called "home" by two adults. They shared their experiences of living in a smart house, interacting daily with sustainable housing design. This paper investigates the functional aspects of adaptation to living in smart housing.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} two important consumer perceptions of brand sourced messages on Facebook fan pages, perceived socialness in brand communication and the brand's control on <b>consumer</b> <b>feedback,</b> <b>and</b> their affects on three relationship outcomes of commitment, trust, and {{attitude toward the}} brand. In addition, the study explored whether the impact of message related perceptions interact with the valence of the brand's image. Two theories, commitment trust theory and social response theory, provide theoretical background for the logic of this study. Interactions of socialness and brand control were found for commitment, trust, and brand attitude. Results showed that consumers' evaluation of the brand and the potential of a brand consumer relationship significantly decreased under conditions of low socialness and high control on <b>consumer</b> <b>feedback.</b> The findings also revealed that socialness and brand control do interact with brand image in analyses of several important dependent measures. Key measures were also influenced by consumers' involvement in grocery shopping {{and the amount of}} time spent on Facebook. The findings have theoretical implications that extend the study of relationship marketing to social media environments. Practical implications focus on identifying communication strategies that companies should consider when communicating with consumers over Facebook fan pages and describe how fan pages can be optimized to better develop and maintain ongoing brand consumer relationships...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Social and {{economic}} marginalization are signifi cant problems {{for many people}} living with mental illness. Clinicians and policy-makers have increased their focus on these aspects of recovery. Current outcome measures, however, do not support this focus, and detailed functional measures are not suitable for routine clinical use. This report describes the development and test–retest reliability of the Activity and Participation Questionnaire (APQ 6); a self-report measure of vocational activity and social participation for routine use in community mental health services. Method: The APQ 6 was developed from concepts of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Labour Force Surveys and Census. Field testing and consumer consultation were under-taken in New South Wales (NSW) mental health rehabilitation services. Test–retest reliabil-ity trials were conducted simultaneously by research teams in NSW and Queensland. Results: Pairs of short-cycle test–retest reliability interviews were obtained from 129 mental health service <b>consumers.</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>and</b> test–retest reliability results at question and item levels indicate good construct validity.

40|$|Some service {{reputation}} approaches primarily {{consider the}} consumer's prior {{experience of the}} service via opinion feedback system, may neglect the effect of Trust Transition (TT) in the recommendations of others. The service reputation is propagated via referral network recommendations for service composition and eventually builds a distinct level of consumer trust in the service. Accordingly, the present study proposes a service selection model in which the reputation of a sea-ice provider is estimated by collecting <b>consumer</b> <b>feedbacks</b> <b>and</b> other's recommendations in open networks. The degree of service reputation is appropriately estimated using fuzzy Petri net (FPN) to model the referral activities across the social networks and outrank a set of service alternatives using the global reputation score of a service. Two examples of social services selection are used to demonstrate the proposed approach. The proposed model effectively solves the trust transition problem in the indirect recommendation of the service selection and also enables deception detection in terms of existing evidences for assessment of evaluator credibility that excludes the false evidences of dishonest evaluators...|$|R

40|$|Added Value Food: Co-created myth, art {{and magic}} in {{small-scale}} food production Food has an incredible ability to convey meaning. In the new food economy, creating value added products with appropriately charged meanings is an increasingly complex and risky business. However, there are food manufacturers that seemingly have an uncomplicated and successful ability to value add their products: Small-scale farming Producers. Utilising cultural analysis and ethnography as an approach, this thesis explores the value adding practices of these small-scale Producers, {{with a focus}} on how authenticity is infused in their food products. What is it that they can reveal about the creation of value added food? How do they define and what do they do to add authenticity? How is this meaning infused in their food products? This research reveals small-scale Producers engage in acts of co-created myth with consumers, create spaces that resemble art galleries to sell their products, and engage magic to infuse authenticity. These practices, while embedding desired class position, also reveals the thin line between magic and trickery, the limits of over-reliance on <b>consumer</b> <b>feedback,</b> <b>and</b> raises questions about the future viability of business practices in an evolving food landscape. This thesis calls for small-scale farming Producers to review and evolve their position within the wider food industry and in so doing, develop a collaborative voice as cultural mediators in the New Food Economy...|$|R

With a field experiment, this article addresses the effect of participant interaction and the role of questioning on the performance of blog platforms that aim to solicit online <b>consumer</b> <b>feedback.</b> We show that the role of questioning is a key determinant of the protocol design decision process. In contrast with the industry standard of directive questioning and the intuitive appeal of a collective protocol in a social media setting, this study shows that no questioning, combined with an individual protocol, results in the best feedback quality. The analyses also highlight the value of an individual, no questioning protocol for performance over time and insights in consumers' experiential consumption and personal backgrounds. In terms of feedback quantity, protocols that combine directive questioning with a collective setting are best. These actionable recommendations indicate how market researchers can design online blog platforms to improve <b>consumer</b> <b>feedback</b> quantity <b>and</b> quality...|$|R

500|$|For Ivar Lødemel and Heather Trickey, {{editors of}} An Offer You Can't Refuse': Workfare in International Perspective, {{workfare}} programmes' reliance on compulsion makes them throffers. Citing the Danish model as a particular example, the pair argue that workfare {{involves the use}} of compulsory offers; while the work or education is presented as an offer, because recipients of welfare are dependent upon the help they would lose if they refuse the offer, they effectively have no choice. The compulsive aspect reveals that at least some recipients of welfare, in the eyes of policy makers, require coercion before they will accept offers of work. Neither the chance of paid work nor participation in labour schemes are, alone, enough to encourage some to freely accept the offers they receive. Such compulsion serves to reintegrate people into the labour market, and serves as a kind of [...] "new paternalism". The authors are concerned about this compulsion, and present several arguments against it which are possible or have been utilised in the literature: Firstly, it impacts the rights of those against whom it is used. This may make it objectionable in and of itself, or it may result in undesirable outcomes. Secondly, {{it can be argued that}} benefits must be unconditional in order to act as a genuine safety net. Thirdly, compulsion undermines <b>consumer</b> <b>feedback,</b> <b>and</b> so no differentiation can be made between good and poor programmes presented to those receiving welfare. Fourthly, such coercion may contribute to a culture of resistance among those receiving welfare.|$|R

Data collection involved focus group discussions and individual phone interviews of a convenience sample (N = 5) of an Alzheimer’s Australia state based Consumer Advisory Committee. Thematic analysis utilised the Leximancer software. <b>Consumer</b> <b>feedback</b> suggested a reordering of the interview questions and reversing the data collection sequence to reduce the emotional impact on participants.

Responses to the interview questions indicated caregivers retrospectively considered a timely diagnosis would have provided useful dementia-focused planning, reduced the difficulties of living with uncertainty and would have provided more time to obtain information and support. There were strong expectations for medical practitioners to be sensitive to the possibility of dementia and to be cognisant of the diagnostic concerns of caregivers. The diagnosis of dementia and its timing is important to the dementia caregiver in providing an explanation of the problems experienced and allowing earlier organisation of care, future planning and caregiver education to reduce the difficulties of living with undiagnosed and unrecognised dementia...|$|R
