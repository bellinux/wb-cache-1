40|$|Scholarly {{researchers}} {{today are}} increasingly required {{to engage in}} a range of data management planning activities to comply with institutional policies, or as a precondition for publication or grant funding. The latter is especially true in the U. S. in light of the recent White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) mandate aimed at maximizing the availability of all outputs – data as well as the publications that summarize them – resulting from federally-funded research projects. To aid researchers in creating effective data management plans (DMPs), a group of organizations – California Digital Library, DataONE, Digital Curation Centre, Smithsonian Institution, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and University of Virginia Library – collaborated {{on the development of the}} DMPTool, an online application that helps researchers create data management plans. The DMPTool provides detailed guidance, links to general and institutional resources, and walks a researcher through the process of generating a comprehensive plan tailored to specific DMP requirements. The uptake of the DMPTool has been positive: to date, it has been used by over 6, 000 researchers from 800 institutions, making use of more than 20 requirements templates <b>customized</b> for <b>funding</b> bodies. With support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, project partners are now engaged in enhancing the features of the DMPTool. The second version of the tool has enhanced functionality for plan creators and institutional administrators, as well as a redesigned user interface and an open RESTful application programming interface (API). New administrative functions provide the means for institutions to better support local research activities. New capabilities include support for plan co-ownership; workflow provisions for internal plan review; simplified maintenance and addition of DMP requirements templates; extensive capabilities for the customization of guidance and resources by local institutional administrators; options for plan visibility; and UI refinements based on user feedback and focus group testing. The technical work undertaken for the DMPTool Version 2 has been accompanied by a new governance structure and the growth of a community of engaged stakeholders who will form the basis for a sustainable path forward for the DMPTool as it continues to play an important role in research data management activities. </p...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} comprises {{of three}} essays on mutual funds. In the first essay, I test whether fund investors rationally incorporate portfolio manager ownership disclosure in their portfolio allocation decisions. Using a natural experiment, regulations that mandate portfolio manager ownership disclosure, I find that investor flows respond to higher percentage ownership. The relationship between investor flows and percentage ownership is persistent {{well after the}} regulatory change in 2005, suggesting that the investor responses are permanent rather than transient and are robust to several controls as well as unobserved heterogeneity reflected in fund family and manager fixed-effects. The investor responses to ownership are rational, as investors investing in higher percentage ownership funds are rewarded back in terms of higher risk-adjusted performance. Finally, I {{shed light on the}} channels through which higher ownership translates into better investor rewards. I show that agency alleviation is one of the channels through which ownership translates into better investor rewards. These findings are consistent with a "rational investor" viewpoint in which, at least, some investors incorporate managerial ownership in their portfolio allocation decisions. In the second essay, I analyze the "herding" (trading together) behavior of managers, conditional on their ownership stakes in the funds they manage. I find that the funds with low and high managerial ownership have economically distinct patterns in their herding behavior. Each herd has its own distinct trading style and different qualitative and quantitative effect on stock prices. Low ownership funds herd more and engage in positive-feedback trading that is followed by stock price reversals. High ownership fund herding is followed by more stable price adjustments. Low ownership herding effects appear to dominate in the full sample where herding causes price reversal. These findings suggest that there is heterogeneity in the herding behavior of mutual funds, which appears to be related with ownership. It is costly for the high ownership managers to ignore their substantive information due to reputational concerns, or to engage in uninformed trading, and thus herding by such managers results in more informative prices. On the other hand, lower ownership fund herding appears to be driven by agency that generates temporary price movements that are reversed. In the third essay, I and my co-authors, Gerard Hoberg and N. R. Prabhala, propose new techniques for identifying benchmark peers for mutual funds. We identify the location of funds in the space of stock style characteristics. All funds within a pre-specified normed distance are a fund's peers. Our benchmark peers are <b>customized</b> to each <b>fund,</b> intransitive, and employ techniques that are readily scalable across dimensions and loss functions. We show that peers derived in this fashion are significantly different cross-sectionally from conventional peers and exhibit considerable dynamic churn. The customized peers we construct outperform traditional peers in out of sample prediction tests, have lower tracking error, and our peer-excess alphas predict the future Characteristic-Selectivity and Carhart alphas of funds. We find that measures of competition derived from our peers predict performance persistency of funds for up to four quarters...|$|R
