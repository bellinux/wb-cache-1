5|$|The album embraces {{a form of}} {{symbolism}} {{that would}} eventually become a staple of Morrison's songs, equating earthly love and heaven, or as close as a living being <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> it. Morrison and Davis's upright bass {{can be interpreted as}} the earth opposing Kay's percussion and the string arrangement representing heaven and with Berliner's lead acoustic guitar residing on a plane in between.|$|E
5|$|The {{theoretical}} {{thermal conductivity}} of hexagonal Boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> 1700–2000 W/(m·K), {{which has the}} same order of magnitude as the experimental measured value for graphene, and can be comparable to the theoretical calculations for graphene nanoribbons. Moreover, the thermal transport in the BNNRs is anisotropic. The thermal conductivity of zigzag-edged BNNRs is about 20% larger than that of armchair-edged nanoribbons at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron <b>can</b> <b>approach,</b> but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the members}} of a close binary system raises tides on the other through {{gravitational}} interaction. However the bulges can be slightly misaligned with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> a stable equilibrium. The effect can be more complex in cases where the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane.|$|E
5|$|In general, RNA viruses have smaller genome sizes than DNA viruses {{because of}} a higher error-rate when replicating, and have a maximum upper size limit. Beyond this limit, errors in the genome when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive. To {{compensate}} for this, RNA viruses often have segmented genomes– the genome is split into smaller molecules– thus reducing the chance that an error in a single-component genome will incapacitate the entire genome. In contrast, DNA viruses generally have larger genomes {{because of the high}} fidelity of their replication enzymes. Single-strand DNA viruses are an exception to this rule, however, as mutation rates for these genomes <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> the extreme of the ssRNA virus case.|$|E
5|$|In his discourses {{recorded}} in the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan mentions that humans {{would not be able}} to withstand meeting god in his divine form, hence God takes human form (simultaneously living in his abode) so people <b>can</b> <b>approach,</b> understand and love him in the form of an Avatar. While no detailed statistical information is available, most of the followers of Swaminarayan share a belief that Swaminarayan is the complete manifestation of Narayana or Purushottam Narayana - the Supreme Being and superior to other avatars. A Swaminarayan sectarian legend tells how Narayana from the Nara Narayana pair, was cursed by sage Durvasa to incarnate on the earth as Swaminarayan.|$|E

5|$|Geneforge 2 is a {{role-playing}} {{game where}} the player's choice of answers during conversations with non-player characters affects how the player is regarded amongst the game's four factions. The player character is an apprentice Shaper, a feared and secretive group who can create life. Players create a character {{from one of}} three character classes and explore the area surrounding Drypeak, a failing Shaper colony, solving quests and gaining experience. Each of the three character classes has a particular playing style and <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> tasks in different ways. Guardians are fighters who excel in standard combat skills, especially hand-to-hand fighting. They are capable of shaping creations, but have little affinity for magic. Agents are the game's version of rogues, and excel in spell casting and are capable of hand-to-hand combat. The Shaper is a summoner, capable of creating living creatures by using their own life essence. Shapers rely on their creations for protection. Players can also convince certain non-player characters to join them.|$|E
5|$|Most {{conventions}} {{will feature}} {{some kind of}} an art show, in which artists' work is displayed, often for direct purchase or auction during the convention. There will often be a Dealers Den where art and comic book distributors and other merchants can sell their wares for a fee, and an Artists' Alley where individual artists are given space for no fee or a token fee, usually on the condition that they only sell their own work. Artists may also trade art between each other using sketchbooks. Erotic art is typically allowed if kept separate from other pieces, and only shown to adult attendees; a few conventions are rated strictly PG-13. Individual transactions are relatively small (usually around US$10–$50 for sketches or badges, $10–$200 for auction pieces), but the total <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> US$100,000 at the largest events (excluding professional dealers).|$|E
25|$|The term 'alcohol dependence' has {{replaced}} 'alcoholism' {{as a term}} in order that individuals do not internalize the idea of cure and disease, but <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> alcohol as a chemical they may depend upon to cope with outside pressures.|$|E

25|$|Fishing {{and camping}} are popular {{activities}} along the Tye River. Sections of the Tye River {{are also popular}} for whitewater boating with canoes and kayaks. The rapids are rated ClassI to ClassII+. Depending upon water conditions some rapids on the Tye River <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> classIII.|$|E
25|$|Pentacene, as well {{as other}} organic conductors, is subject to rapid {{oxidation}} in air, which precludes commercialization. If the pentacene is preoxidized, the pentacene-quinone is a potential gate insulator, then the mobility <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> that of rubrene – the highest-mobility organic semiconductor – namely, 40cm2/(V·s). This pentacene oxidation technique is akin to the silicon oxidation used in the silicon electronics.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} driver mount is a {{flat panel}} (i.e., baffle) with the drivers mounted in holes in it. However, in this approach, sound frequencies with a wavelength {{longer than the}} baffle dimensions are canceled out, because the antiphase radiation {{from the rear of}} the cone interferes with the radiation from the front. With an infinitely large panel, this interference could be entirely prevented. A sufficiently large sealed box <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> this behavior.|$|E

25|$|Tocqueville {{includes}} in {{his report}} on Algeria that the fate of their soldiers and finances depended on how the French government treats the various native populations of Algeria, including the various Arab tribes, independent Kabyles living in the Atlas Mountains, and the powerful political leader Abd-el-Kader. In his various letters and essays on Algeria, Tocqueville discusses contrasting strategies by which a European country <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> imperialism. In particular, the author differentiates between what he terms 'dominance' and a particular version of 'colonization'.|$|E
25|$|Mine rollers {{and mine}} flails. The roller method {{originated}} during World War I and the flail method during World War II but both are still used. Neither system is completely reliable and both will leave undetonated mines, requiring the minefield to be rechecked by another method. Mine flail effectiveness <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> 100% in ideal conditions, but clearance rates {{as low as}} 50–60% have been reported. This is well below the 99.6% standard set by the United Nations for humanitarian demining.|$|E
25|$|Efficiency: For maglev systems the {{lift-to-drag}} ratio can exceed that of aircraft (for example Inductrack <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> 200:1 at high speed, {{far higher than}} any aircraft). This can make maglev more efficient per kilometer. However, at high cruising speeds, aerodynamic drag is much larger than lift-induced drag. Jets take advantage of low air density at high altitudes to significantly reduce air drag. Hence despite their {{lift-to-drag ratio}} disadvantage, they can travel more efficiently at high speeds than maglev trains that operate at sea level.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that plural pronouns can have {{quantified}} antecedents which do not ccommand them. While both Heim's E-type approach and DRT's Abstraction <b>approach</b> <b>can</b> handle some cases of this, there are certain cases neither <b>approach</b> <b>can</b> handle, when the quantified antecedent is embedded with the scope of another quantifier.

25|$|In hand-to-hand combat, {{the player}} {{has four main}} attacks; high kick, low kick, punch, and grapple. After hitting an enemy {{a certain number of}} times, the enemy will be stunned, at which point the player can perform a combo by {{pressing}} a series of buttons. During stealth missions, the player is automatically placed into stealth mode. The player <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> enemies from behind and either knock them out or kill them. Bumping into objects or walking over broken glass or plastic bags will cause nearby enemies to become aware of the player's presence.|$|E
25|$|A {{more useful}} {{polarized}} beam {{can be obtained}} by tilting the pile of plates at a steeper angle to the incident beam. Counterintuitively, using incident angles greater than Brewster's angle yields a higher degree of polarization of the transmitted beam, at the expense of decreased overall transmission. For angles of incidence steeper than 80° the polarization of the transmitted beam <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> 100% with as few as four plates, although the transmitted intensity is very low in this case. Adding more plates and reducing the angle allows a better compromise between transmission and polarization to be achieved.|$|E
25|$|Torque {{heads back}} to Abbot {{by way of the}} beach, where he {{encounters}} Clem (Ross Douglas), an elderly inmate who {{was in the middle of}} an escape when the earthquake struck. Clem has a small one-person boat ready to sail, but needs Torque's help fighting creatures emerging from a wrecked slave ship before he can leave. Torque sets fire to the wreck, enabling Clem to escape. He enters Abbot's sewer system where he encounters Horace, who tells him Abbot wants his soul. He then heads to the electric chair, destroying it and releasing Horace's spirit. Returning to death row, he finds Killjoy's diagnosis, and then returns to the radio room. Successfully sending a signal, he learns a Coast Guard vessel is on the way. However, Carnate's lighthouse is not working, and must be reactivated before the vessel <b>can</b> <b>approach</b> the island. Torque heads to the lighthouse, passing through the old military barracks, Fort Maleson. In the fort, he encounters Hermes, who forces him to fight. Torque defeats him by using pressurized gas to push Hermes into a furnace. He continues to the lighthouse, outside of which he meets Ernesto Alverez, who is trying to find his family. They restore power, and reactivate the lighthouse, arranging to meet the ship at the dock.|$|E
