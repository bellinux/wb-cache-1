40|$|Agri-environmental {{schemes and}} <b>cross-compliance</b> {{are the two}} main {{components}} of the Common Agricultural Policy that address environmental issues. Under regulation 1698 / 2005, agri-environmental scheme design {{has been established in}} such a way as to use <b>cross-compliance</b> as the baseline against which prescriptions and payments are identified. In this framework, agri-environmental payments to farmers are justified only for the component of public goods produced (if any) above the <b>cross-compliance</b> prescription level. This constraint has become a major determinant of the design of agri-environmental schemes in all EU Member States in which both instruments are implemented. This paper investigates farmer participation, compliance choices and socially optimal level of monitoring when <b>cross-compliance</b> and agri-environmental schemes are jointly considered, and when information about compliance is asymmetrically distributed between farmers and the public regulator. The results show that the two policy instruments interact with each other, with agri-environmental payments actually providing incentives for <b>cross-compliance,</b> when the <b>cross-compliance</b> monitoring and sanction system does not guarantee full compliance. However, the numerical example in Emilia-Romagna (Italy) demonstrates that with the present combination of controls and sanctions, farmers have very little incentive to be compliant with both cross compliance and agri-environmental schemes. Hence, the results highlight that the monitoring in CC or in AES does not have the same effect on the farmers’ compliance. This underscores the need for further research in this field, particularly as provision of environmental goods becomes more important in the future Common Agricultural Policy...|$|E

Yearly surveys carried out have showed that, even if FAS is differently operational in the Member States, the core approach is based on one-to-one advice on the farm mainly covering <b>cross-compliance</b> issues. Only in some Member States advice on agri-environmental issues within the FAS has been reported. In Lombardy Region the uptake of an agri-environmental measure on balanced fertilisation and crop rotation demonstrates how the participation of farmers within a geographically homogeneous area can be scattered.

40|$|Olive farming on sloping land in {{southern}} Europe is facing multiple challenges {{and it is}} reasonable to believe that farmers will opt for the abandonment of some systems and intensification or change to organic production of other systems. The issues at stake surpass financial farm viability and two EU policy instruments - <b>cross-compliance</b> and agri-environmental measures (AEM) - are available to address environmental objectives. This paper explores how <b>cross-compliance</b> and AEM policy options may lead to shifts in olive production systems and their social and environmental effects in Trás-os-Montes, NE Portugal over 25 Â years under two sets of conditions of uncertainty: decision-making by land users and market scenarios. Uncertainty in decision-making is addressed by employing five alternative goal programming models. The models include Linear Programming (LP), Weighted Goal Programming (WGP) and MINMAX Goal Programming (MINMAX GP), the GP variants of which are moreover formulated from a societal (S) and farmer (F) perspective. Uncertainty in market prospects is addressed by projecting olive oil and labour prices and trends in farm subsidies, distinguishing four price combinations in market scenarios. The models were validated by their capability to reproduce the initial configuration of olive production systems. Six policy options are evaluated under the complete ranges of uncertainty factors in a total of 6 Â xÂ  5 Â xÂ  4 Â =Â  120 model runs. Results show overall large effects of farmer decision-making and market scenarios. The <b>cross-compliance</b> and AEM policy instruments have an unequivocal effect on environmental performance and help to maintain work in rural areas. However, farmer income levels are insensitive to the policies, all work is absorbed by family labour and important environmental issues linked to more intensive systems such as pollution are not addressed. In a case study with the WGP (F) model which best reproduced the initial configuration of production systems, <b>cross-compliance</b> was moreover found to burden farmers under adverse market conditions, while AEM contributed to farmer's objectives under favourable market conditions. A solution would be to focus <b>cross-compliance</b> regulations on intensive systems and offer appropriate AEM for traditional or abandoned orchards. Both policy instruments proved effective, but there is scope for removing substantial overlap between them.

40|$|European {{farmers have}} been {{adopting}} different practices {{in response to}} the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). One of the new features of the CAP is the effort to encourage multifunctional farming systems which, besides food, also deliver environmental goods and services.

In this study we examine how farmers have been coping with the CAP and its implications in terms of farm pathway dependence. The results reveal that intensive farmers adhere to <b>cross-compliance</b> and are exploring the possibilities for complying with greening in order to access the direct payments integrally, but either do not accesses or access the basic (entry) level of the AES in order to avoid taking land out of production.

40|$|Developing {{and using}} the concept of 'cross compliance' this report {{provides}} {{an examination of the}} primary and secondary effects of agri-environmental policies. <b>Cross-compliance</b> is applied to a number of agri-environmental policies; CAP reform, the 'accompanying measures' of CAP reform and a selection of member state agri-environmental policies. The development of the concept of cross compliance provides a useful tool to perform evaluation on the effectiveness and efficiency of general policy instruments, but specifically policy scenarios designed to reduce nitrate pollution of groundwater due to agriculture and goes some way to help answer policy questions on which mechanism may achieve a wide range of performance criteria. <b>Cross-compliance</b> can be applied at different levels of the policy and can be used to categorise policies into a number of sets according to specified criteria. CAP reform policies designed to control supply, although having positive environmental effects, are not as successful at achieving environmental objectives in comparison to the 'accompanying measures' elements of CAP reform. However a number of the policies from the accompanying measures package, for example the protection of rare breeds and the shelter planting, have very specific and narrow aims and so do not achieve large positive cross compliance for reductions in nitrate pollution. The analysis also deals with a number of other policies, some agricultural in basis, such as the Less Favoured Areas policy, which scored highly in achieving income redistribution to the targeted group but failed in achieving positive environmental effects. A number of useful trends have been identified and these may be useful for formulating future agri-environmental policy in terms of achieving higher degrees of <b>cross-compliance.</b> It is recognised that this technique would be usefully expanded and that it warrants further investigation in order that a quantitative valuation of positive and negative <b>cross-compliance</b> could eventually be attached to each policy. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper's aim is {{to assess}} {{effectiveness}} of the implementation of nature conservation measures in Polish agriculture. Environmental regulations influence main groups of Common Agricultural Policy instruments. In the I pillar of the policy, it refers to <b>cross-compliance,</b> in the II pillar it refers to agri-environmental programmes, the Natura 2000 payments and organic farming support. In Poland they are ineffectively implemented and insufficiently directed to nature conservation. This refers both to domestic environmental and agricultural policy. In some aspects they are not coordinated. This is connected with delay in construction of protection plans which are necessary for proper policy in the Natura 2000 network. Consequently, the specialized payments for farmers in the Natura 2000 network have not been implemented yet while the extent in which agri-environmental measures have been implemented is too small. Moreover, the system of control and certification in organic farming does not involve requirements referring to biodiversity.

40|$|The 2003 {{reform of}} the European Union Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{introduced}} Single Farm Payments (SFPs) which are decoupled payments conditional on <b>cross-compliance,</b> and allows these payments to be claimed for land kept fully idle but maintained in good agricultural and environmental conditions (GAEC). This paper focuses on {{the potential impact of}} the reform on land idling decisions in France {{with the help of a}} survey of the intentions of landowners. Both operator and non-operator landowners were considered since, although SFP entitlements are owned only by operator landowners in France, non-operator landowners may now have a higher incentive to switch to operating land by idling land and maintaining it under GAEC in order to claim SFPs. The key variables in landowners’ decisions to idle land in GAEC appear to be both monetary and non-monetary.

40|$|The {{financial}} {{impacts of}} a hypothetical <b>cross-compliance</b> program were estimated for seventy-six farmers in Gibson County, Tennessee. Several federal program benefits {{were compared to}} the least-cost method of achieving one of four different soil displacement limits {{to determine if the}} costs of voluntarily participating in a <b>cross-compliance</b> program were greater than the benefits. If cost-sharing were available, farmers would have a positive incentive to cross comply to 5 tons per acre per year on 57. 3 percent of all fields. This figure rises to 90. 9 percent compliance at 20 tons per acre per year. Key words: cross compliance, policy, soil conservation, Tennessee conservation. Although federal soil conservation policies have been evolving since the early 1930 s, soil erosion on America's farmlands persists and is expected to intensify in the future if there are increased cropland demands (Crosson and Brubaker). At the same time that farmland erosion problems exist, farmers continue to have difficulty maintaining a level of pros-perity comparable to other sectors. This well-known "farm problem " means many farmers depend on government support programs such as price supports, federally subsidized crop in-surance, special credit terms, and special tax regulations. Policy makers are searching for more effec-tive methods of encouraging farmers to prac-tice greater conservation, and cross com-pliance has been proposed as such an incentive strategy (USDA). A cross-compli-ance policy would either make participation in certain government farm programs contingent upon farmers ' attainment of certain conserva-tion standards (the "red ticket approach"), or alternatively, the benefits of farm assistance programs would increase if farmers met or ex-ceeded conservation standards (the "green ticket approach ' '). <b>Cross-compliance</b> strate-gies have considerable political appeal in that Sandra S.
