At present pears have been marketed primarily through individual cooperative with some coordinations and supports by Tottori Fruit Growers Cooperative Association. But recently the <b>consummers</b> needs have been changing for higher quality fruit, the improvement of fruit quality is essential. One of the fundamental features of marketing structure of agricultural commodities has been the marketing through wholesale markets, but the vertical coordination between growers and buyers is increasing both in and outside wholesale market routes. And as the <b>consummer's</b> desire for higher quality rise, the share of supermarkets rises. Therefore the orderly marketing, improvement of fruit quality for higher commercial value, and the sales promotion are essential for the competitive markets, and the horizontal coordination between growers and buyers, quick information gathering throughout cooperatives, and strengthening of bargaining power are also essential. When <b>consummers</b> desire for higher quality, supermarkets' shares rise, and international competitions in fruit marketing intensify. The total execution of the above strategies, making proper use of good orchards and seeking assistance by and cooperation with Tottori Prefectural Fruit Growers Cooperative Association, becomes most important.

Actually some main reasons have been underlined in the literature.

40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need of {{conforming}} the binding regulation, by means of their interpretation, to the observed tendencies of economic crime.

The article indicated the negative effects of interpretation according to which property swindled out of consumers by employees of the unit of socialized economy is considered to be the collective property, what in turn results in sentencing perpetrators for appropriation of collective property and holding them liable, in criminal proceedings for damages equal in value to the said property, payable to the unit of socialized economy. As far as art. 1. 1 of The Speculation Elimination Act is concerned, the trait „goods intended for sale in the unit of socialized commerce or in the catering business" has to be interpreted {{in such a way as}} to extend protection of penal law on all stages of transfer of goods designed for the average <b>consummer,</b> from the production establishment to the ultimate seller.

40|$|Several {{problems}} of unfair competition {{are discussed in}} the article: a concept of unfair competition in the doctrine of law, preventing it in the judicial practice in capitalist countries and new tendencies in a developement of unfair competition laws. The study is of a comparative character, i. e. laws of the largest capitalist countries and at the same time, principal legal systems are analyzed i. e. French, English and West German regulations, with due regard paid to the systems of the United States, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden as well as of Poland (on account of the pre-war act of 1926 on preventing unfair competition). A phenomenon of unfair competition was closely related to economic developpement of the age of early capitalism and fluorishing free competition, its concept in the European doctrine of law had its roots in the protection of exclusive rights falling within the scope of industrial property. In some legal systems the notion of unfair competition was extended {{on the grounds of the}} adopted "right to goodwill" (fr. achalandage), "right to competition" or principle of "fair commercial practices". Preventing unfair competition in a judicial practice is based either on general principles of liability in torts (England, France) or on special laws designed to prevent unfair competition (Federal Republic of Germany). Judicial decisions are of significant importance in forming principles of unfair competition prevention, In the United States the concept of unfair competition which is understood to be a tortious act is regulated by anti-trust law; it involves not only actions which are contrary to fair business practices but also activities which can cause restraints of competition. In business practice, signs of unfair competition are not only prejudicing interests of competitors or disturbing the principle of a full play of market forces, but they also prejudice consummers' interests. This aspect of unfair competition is more often noticed in a doctrine of law and in legislational and judicial activities. Interpretation of notion of unfair competition itself developes into widening its scope to include questions of <b>consummer</b> protection. At the same time the tendencies are observed to control market activities in administrational and legal way in order to protect consummers' interests.

40|$|The use {{of direct}} {{distribution}} of agricultural products is, {{in most of}} the cases in France, initiated by producers. The few experiments led by groups of <b>consummers</b> were limited, until now, to organic products. The recent expansion of <b>consummers</b> networks (AMAP) based on the japanese experience of Teikei (Ikegami, 2005) brings out new explanations to the growing success of direct distribution. However, the farmer's motivation remains the starting point for these initiatives in Brittany. The focus {{of this paper is to}} describe these motivations considering the expectations of a growing part of the population. The analysis conducted by Matthieu Anasaloni (chapter 8) on the motivations propounded by <b>consummers</b> met in Guichen annual organic agriculture exhibition shows three main categories: country-style nostalgia, contemporary hedonism and (micro-) political involvements. The objective of this paper is to understand how producers try to answer these expectations through direct distribution. Thus, the producer's motivations can be understood as direct answers to these needs : 1. coming back to traditional agriculture, 2. catching market opportunities and 3. a political reaction to intensive production processes. Based on the answers of 38 producers in Brittany who use direct distribution, this paper proposes to confront these assumptions to the reality of the process that leads a growing number of farmers to choose this short and alternative relation with the public. We can first set aside the first assumption. Some traditional values of agriculture are not necessary incompatible with a modern production process: promoting quality can be achieved considering recent norms and the relationships can be convivial even over the neighbourhood. If nostalgia does exist in the mind of a category of <b>consummers,</b> we do not consider that producers who learnt their activity in a context of a centralized agriculture take that nostalgia into account in their approach. The second class of motivation seems to be more relevant in the light of the answers given for our survey. The search for added value is the main reason for farmers to adopt direct distribution. But this assertion must take the size of farms into account: small farms can use direct distribution to balance the lack of economies of scale and large ones use short tracks in response to cyclical or sectorial shocks. However the producer's wish to extract his activity from the standard production with that kind of differenciation does not seem so obvious. We can enlarge the possible opportunities given by direct distribution by considering the adaptation of the activity to the familial structure and the search for contact as the will to give value to a special skill. Once more, these opportunities can not explain by themselves the pace of the producers. Most of the producers live in couple, but the fact to be in couple is not significantly determinant in the choice. A skill given by an past experience requiring contact with a public can be a source of motivation, but we observe that this category of producer is not more likely to invest itself in selling tasks. The farmers's wish to be in contact with the <b>consummers</b> and with the public finds its source in a need for recognition of agriculture as a whole and not only for differenciation on the part of one single farm. Most of these opportunities are taken into account by producers in accordance with each attribute. But {{in most of the}} cases, the economics and rational explanations show their limits. Thus, it seems also necessary to consider direct distribution as a critical reaction to the socio- economic context and as an evolution of agricultural practices. A global view of the deep motivations of the producers we met shows a divide between trying to improve the image of agriculture and searching for an alternative of the productivist agriculture. If the first class tend toward a perspective of sustained development – an attitude that can take a concrete form in the landscape practices or in the contractaul engagements (CTE, CAD) - the other one comprehend direct distribution as a break with the existing model. But all of the producers consider direct distribution as a gain of autonomy. This autonomy has a important cost in time, work and avalaibility. This important cost confirms the need for farmers to believe more in their own convictions than in an invividual rationality. La vente directe de produits agricoles est en France, dans la plupart des cas, l'initiative de producteurs. Le développement récent des AMAP montre que cela peut évoluer. Dans ce contexte il est important de comprendre les motivations des agriculteurs engagés dans la vente directe, d'autant plus que cette motivation individuelle est à l'origine de la plupart des initiatives en Bretagne. L'analyse des motivations des consommateurs peut s'organiser autour de la nostalgie rurale, de l'hédonisme contemporain et de micro-engagements politiques. Nous proposons en parallèle d'examiner en quoi les vendeurs directs cherchent à revenir à une certaine tradition paysanne, cherchent à profiter d'opportunités de marché ou bien construisent une réaction de nature politique au paradigme productiviste. Une enquête auprès de 38 vendeurs directs de Haute-Bretagne permet d'éliminer la première hypothèse : pas l'ombre d'une nostalgie dans les réponses. Par contre la recherche de valeur ajoutée semble la raison principale et largement partagée. Pour les petites fermes c'est un complément d'activité, pour les plus grosses c'est une diversification pour contrer les risques de marché. Autre opportunité, la vente directe valorise le travail familial, et particulièrement le travail des femmes. Néanmoins, si presque tous les vendeurs directs travaillent en couple, cela n'est pas le facteur décisif du choix. L'expérience passée d'un contact avec le public semble plus déterminante. Les motivations économiques ne suffisent pas à décrire les choix.
