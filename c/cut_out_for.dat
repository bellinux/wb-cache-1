Again Lamptey would score {{his only}} goals in the League Cup, netting twice against Hull City (once in the home leg and once in the away leg). His time at Coventry further proved that Lamptey was not <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Premiership football, and another engagement in Venice was also a flop. Lamptey went on to join a string of lower status clubs. This began a vicious circle {{that he could not}} break.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1746, the Fairfield East Association of Ministers {{contacted}} the Church at the Unity Parish in Trumbull and advised them that Reverend Beebe was ready to become the minister at their parish. Beebe was ordained and installed at Unity Parish in May 1747. Beebe had his work <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> him though, as the church had become scattered in 1744 by the conversion to Episcopacy by the last pastor, Reverend Richardson Miner. Under Beebe's leadership, 167 parishioners {{were added to the}} Unity Church rolls. Reverend Beebe's ministry in Trumbull lasted for 38 years until he died in office on September 8, 1785, in his 68th year.|$|E
25|$|The {{victims of}} the first attack, Jimmy Hollis and Mary Jeanne Larey, were the only victims to give a {{description}} of their attacker. They described him as being six feet tall with a white mask over his face with holes <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> his eyes and mouth. Although Hollis believed {{he was a young}} dark-tanned white man under 30 years old, Larey believed he was a light-skinned African-American. The only other surviving victim was Katie Starks, but she never saw her assailant. Since Hollis and Larey were the only survivors to give a description, it cannot be known if the killer wore a mask during the other attacks.|$|E

25|$|After the event, Mr. William and Donna Smith, {{investigators}} {{associated with}} Civilian Saucer Investigation, LA, obtained {{a number of}} accounts from witnesses {{who claimed to have}} experienced a similar or related phenomena. These accounts included the story of a mother and her 21-year-old-daughter, who claimed to have encountered a creature with the same appearance and odor a week prior to the September 12 incident. The encounter reportedly affected the daughter so badly that she was confined to Clarksburg Hospital for three weeks. They also gathered a statement from the mother of Eugene Lemon, in which she said that, at the approximate time of the crash, her house had been violently shaken and her radio had <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> 45 minutes, and a report from the director of the local Board of Education in which he claimed to have seen a flying saucer taking off at 6:30a.m. on September13 (the morning after the creature was sighted).|$|E

Having lost to Zvonareva in straight sets {{just a few weeks}} ago in Tokyo, Kvitová had her work <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> her, but this time it was different - Kvitová hadn't lost an indoor match all year and her huge serve, powerful groundstrokes and strong net play were working like a charm as she raced out to a 6–2, 4–1 lead. Things got tougher as the unforced errors began to creep into Kvitová's game, and Zvonareva closed the gap to 4–all in the second set; but the No.3-seeded Kvitová broke again for 5–4 and served it out, getting two errors in a row from the No.6-seeded Zvonareva to get to match point then knifing a forehand volley. The series between the two is now knotted at 3–3. Kvitová ended with an even differential, 24 winners to 24 errors; she won 17 of 23 net points (including match point). Zvonareva was −9 (eight winners, 17 errors).|$|E
25|$|The Isle of Man {{celebrated its}} inaugural celebration in 2012 at the Isle of Man College of Higher {{education}} on 19 November 2012. The organization emphasised the 2012 theme which highlighted World Health Organization figures showing {{that every year}} over {{half a million people}} die from violence and 83% of them are men and boys, and that a similar proportion of the global burden of disease (ill-health, disability or early death) from violence is borne by males. For activities the NSC held strength tests and health advice; The Children's Centre loaned out their interactive babies and some parenting information and Will Sutton attended as the 'Positive' male role model for the day. The Student Council baked and sold cakes, and Sami-Jaine Martin (Student President) was running a Sexual Health Stand. The engineering group was selling moustaches and raising money for men's cancer charities, while construction group (with help from the art department) made an 8ft seaside <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> photographs on the day. The beauty therapy department offered their time to pamper the boys with Indian head massages and face mapping, and there were also 3 students who volunteered to have their chest waxed to raise money for charity.|$|E
40|$|Allometric {{models for}} {{dominant}} shade tree species were developed for coffee agroforestry systems in Villa Rica, Peru. The studied shade tree species were Eucalyptus saligna, Pinus tecunumanii, Pinus radiata and Prumnopitys harmsiana.

By non-destructive method of using Field-Map technology was measured 258 individuals. From these data have been calculated volumes of 4 types of <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> destined <b>for</b> the local standards for determining the commercial utilizable tree trunk.

500|$|The {{original}} {{airing of}} [...] "Children of the Gods" [...] on Showtime featured full frontal nudity during the scene showing {{the possession of}} Sha're (Vaitiare Bandera) by Amonet. While this has never been repeated on network television and subsequent airings have had the nudity <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> syndication; it was rated [...] R by the MPAA. According to Brad Wright, the Showtime network had insisted on the full frontal nudity despite Wright's vocal opposition; Wright told fan site GateWorld that he would cut the nudity scene from the 2009 direct-to-DVD recut of the pilot episode. The DVD version, in fact, only retains a portion of this scene, with full frontal nudity being cut and a partial syndicate friendly back nudity version used. [...] Likely because of the nudity, the original version of this episode {{as well as the}} next two episodes of the series are the first and only ones in the series to be rated by the MPAA (it is rated R), while in the UK the episode is rated 18 by the BBFC (all other episodes have generally been rated PG, or 12, very occasionally 15). It is rated M in Australia, recommended for (but not restricted to) viewers 15 and older. The version available online through streaming is the uncut, original version of the episode.|$|E

The rest of the family, still trapped in the panic room, are preparing to potentially drown from the sprinklers filling the room up with water.

At the last minute Joe rescues them, draining the water out of the room, thus saving their lives. Joe informs the family he has arrested the burglars, but they are pressing harassment charges against Meg. Joe warns that they will need a lawyer to combat the charges, but the family ignores him, and Joe finally gives up and takes Meg away while the family ignores her cries for help.|$|E
