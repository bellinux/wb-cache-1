5|$|The {{accident}} investigation {{concluded that the}} crash was primarily attributable to Holland's personality and behavior, USAF leaders' inadequate reactions to the previous incidents involving Holland, and {{the sequence of events}} and aircrew response during the final flight of the aircraft. Holland's disregard for procedures governing the safe operation of the B-52 aircraft that he commanded and the absence of firm and consistent <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> by his superior officers allowed Holland to believe that he could conduct his flight in an unsafe manner, culminating with the slow, steeply banked, 360° turn around the control tower.|$|E

Managing <b>corrective</b> <b>actions</b> to closure is known to aid software quality assurance, in general, and testing process activities, in particular. In this paper, a framework for software testing assessment, namely OSS-TPA, that aims to evaluate <b>corrective</b> <b>actions</b> in OSS test process, is proposed. The OSS-TPA framework is based on earlier studies and relies on a conceptual model for test process activities in OSS development. Using success factors in OSS development, the relationship between the maturity of managing <b>corrective</b> <b>actions</b> and the adoption of OSS is investigated.

25|$|In 2012, {{the school}} {{declined}} to <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> II 6th Year status due to intractable low student {{math and reading}} achievement. In 2011, the school was in <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> II 5th Year status due to chronic lagging math and reading achievement. In 2010, the school declined to <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> II 4th Year status due to continuing low student math and reading achievement. The attendance rate was 93% in both 2010 and 2011. In accordance with No Child Left Behind, due to low student achievement, the school was mandated to allow students to transfer to a successful school in the district. Students may transfer to either Stetser Elementary School or Chester Upland School of the Arts. The district must provide transportation. Free tutoring is offered after school to help eligible students improve in reading, mathematics and science. The school has a Title I and Parent- School Community Council which works with parents to improve student performance. In 2009–10, enrollment was 365 pupils with 40 children in preschool. There were 16.5 teachers.|$|E

In 2011, the School was in <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> II 5th Year status due to ongoing low student achievement. In 2010, {{the school was}} in <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> II 4th Year status due to chronic low student achievement in reading and mathematics. In 2011, the attendance rate was 89%, while in 2010 it was 88%. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 41 of the Columbus Elementary School's classroom teachers are Not Highly Qualified. The school is on the state's Persistently failing school list in 2010 and 2011. Under No Child Left Behind, the school is mandated to provide Supplemental Education Services (outside of school tutoring) to assist students to succeed in reading and math. Additionally, the school was required to offer to transfer children to a successful school in the district. In 2009, {{as part of a}} district restructuring, eighth grade was added to the school. Seventh grade was added to the school, in 2008. Due to the inadequate achievement, the school is eligible for extra funding through the School Improvement Grants. In 2009–10, enrollment was 828 pupils with 77 children in Preschool. There were 48 teachers.|$|E
