The arms are blazoned Azure, a saltire Or, meaning a gold (or yellow) saltire on a blue field. The arms were subsequently used by the Abbey of St Albans, founded by King Offa of Mercia. With the dissolution of the Abbey and the incorporation of the borough of St Albans the device was used on the town's <b>corporate</b> <b>seal</b> and was officially recorded as the arms of the town at an heraldic visitation in 1634.|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "Seattle" [...] {{appears on}} {{official}} Washington Territory papers dated May 23, 1853, {{when the first}} plats for the village were filed. In 1855, nominal land settlements were established. On January 14, 1865, the Legislature of Territorial Washington incorporated the Town of Seattle with a board of trustees managing the city. The Town of Seattle was disincorporated on January 18, 1867, and remained a mere precinct of King County until late 1869, when a new petition was filed and the city was re-incorporated December 2, 1869, with a Mayor-council government.

The Restatement of Contracts (Second) notes that Impressions {{directly on the}} paper were recognized early and are still common for notarial and <b>corporate</b> <b>seals,</b> and gummed paper wafers have been widely used. In the absence of statute, decisions have divided {{on the effectiveness of}} the written or printed word 'seal', the printed initials 'L.S.' ..., a scrawl made with a pen (often called a 'scroll') and a recital of sealing. The relaxation of the definition of a seal was generally contemporaneous with reduced distinctions given to sealed contracts. This trend {{can be seen as a}} parallel of the courts' modern relaxation of their interpretation of the Statute of Frauds, and reflects the evolution of modern contract theory from classical contract theory. It has been noted that [...] "about two-thirds of the US states have now adopted statutory provisions depriving the seal of its binding effect," [...] although several important jurisdictions, such as New Jersey and Wisconsin, have retained the concept. Schnell v. Nell (1861), which is widely cited as an example of nominal consideration, involved a sealed contract. Although the distinction of seal had already been abolished by Indiana statute, it is likely the parties viewed the seal as making the contract enforceable, much as the nominal consideration of $1 would have under classical contract theory.|$|R

5000|$|Breed {{registries}} usually issue certificates {{for each}} recorded animal, called a Pedigree, Pedigreed animal documentation, or most commonly, an animal's [...] "papers". Registration papers may {{consist of a}} simple certificate or a listing of ancestors in the animal's background, sometimes with a chart showing the lineage. Usually, there is space for the listing of successive owners, who must sign and date the document if the animal is gifted, leased or sold. Papers transferred upon sale of an animal may be submitted to the registry in order to update the ownership information, and in most cases, the registry will then issue {{a new set of}} papers listing the new owner as the proper owner of the horse. Genuine papers are often identifiable as containing the registered name and number of the individual animal and its date of birth, the name of the attesting organization, with the logo if there is one, the name and signature of the registrar or other authorized person, and a <b>corporate</b> stamp or <b>seal.</b>|$|R
