[...] But the villain's head was bound with iron, lest it should fall to pieces from putrefaction, and set conspicuously upon a long spear-shaft for the mockery of London." [...] After the execution in 1660 {{of several of the}} regicides involved in the death of King Charles I eleven years earlier, the diarist John Evelyn remarked: [...] "I saw not their execution, but met their quarters, mangled, and cut, and reeking, as they were brought from the gallows in baskets on the hurdle." [...] Such remains were typically parboiled and displayed as a gruesome reminder of the penalty for high treason, usually wherever the traitor had conspired or found support. [...] Salt and <b>cumin</b> <b>seed</b> would be added during the boiling process: the salt to prevent putrefaction, and the <b>cumin</b> <b>seed</b> to prevent birds pecking at the flesh.|$|E
