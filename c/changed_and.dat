The paper is intended to provide a general account of climate <b>change</b> <b>and</b> migration research, which seeks to extend understanding of {{the relation}} beyond a focus on policy and policy-relevant research. The argument is that because {{the relation between}} climate <b>change</b> <b>and</b> migration is so vast, touching on so many aspects of life, the debate on climate <b>change</b> <b>and</b> migration needs to be pluralised.

40|$|We {{explore the}} inter-temporal linkage between call rate changes, {{consumer}} price index (CPI) <b>changes,</b> <b>and</b> real gross domestic product (GDP) changes in Japan based on the Taylor rule of monetary policy.

According to our empirical results, first, {{we find that the}} relations between call rate <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> GDP <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> those between call rate <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> CPI <b>changes</b> are weak before zero-interest rate policy. Second, we also find that after zero-interest rate policy, mutual inter-temporal relations between call rate <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> GDP <b>changes</b> are seen as the US Taylor rule suggests, although the linkage between call rate <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> CPI <b>changes</b> is not seen. Hence after zero-interest rate policy, regarding call rates and GDP, the relations suggested by US Taylor rule are found in Japan...|$|R

This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all.
