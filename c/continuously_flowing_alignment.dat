40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} <b>flow</b> <b>alignment</b> on the {{relaxation}} dynamics of a lamellar dihlock copolymer melt and {{the dynamics of}} <b>flow</b> <b>alignment</b> itself are investigated using simultaneous measurements of shear stress and birefringence in both the flow plane and the sample plane. The primary advantage of this rhea-optical approach {{in the context of}} <b>flow</b> <b>alignment</b> is that it provides quantitative measurements of the evolution of the macroscopic mechanical properties and the state of the microstructure in real time, in situ as alignment occurs. Further, it provides information on the molecular and microstructural dynamics that give rise to <b>flow</b> <b>alignment.</b> An entangled, nearly symmetric poly(ethylene-propylene) -poly(ethylethy 1 ene) of 50 kg/mol (PEP-PEE- 2) is studied during <b>flow</b> <b>alignment</b> under two different conditions, one that enhances alignment of the lamellae parallel to the sample plane and another that induces alignment perpendicular to the sample plane (lamellar normal along the vorticity axis). The results suggest that the flow process leading to parallel alignment in PEP-PEE- 2 is associated with inhomogeneous deformation such that the orientation of domains in the material undergoes irreversible "rocking", while the process that produces perpendicular alignment occurs under conditions in which the deformation is nearly homogeneous throughout the material. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{motion of}} an {{ellipsoidal}} particle in a viscoelastic liquid subjected to an unconfined shear flow is addressed by numerical simulations. A complex dynamics is found with different transients and long-time regimes {{depending on the}} Deborah number De (De {{is the product of}} the viscoelastic liquid intrinsic time times the applied shear rate). Spiraling orbits toward a log-rolling motion around the vorticity are observed for low Deborah numbers, whereas the particle aligns with its major axis near to the flow direction at high Deborah numbers. The transition from vorticity to <b>flow</b> <b>alignment</b> is characterized by a periodic regime with small amplitude oscillations around orientations progressively shifting from vorticity to flow direction by increasing De. A range of Deborah numbers is detected such that the periodic solution coexists with the <b>flow</b> <b>alignment</b> regime (bistability). A further range of De is found where <b>flow</b> <b>alignment</b> is attained differently for particles starting far from or next to the shear plane: in the latter case, very long transients are found; hence an effective bistability (metabistability) is predicted to occur in a large time lapse before reaching the fully aligned state. Finally, the computed Deborah number values for <b>flow</b> <b>alignment</b> favorably compare with available experimental data. © 2014 American Physical Society...|$|R

40|$|We discuss to {{what extent}} it is {{possible}} to distinguish macroscopically a truly biaxial nematic liquid crystal from a biaxial mixture of uniaxial aggregates in lyotropic systems. We propose for some cases simple experiments to resolve this question. The behaviour in an external magnetic field and the <b>flow</b> <b>alignment</b> in a shear flow experiment is discussed. We find that for small shear the <b>flow</b> <b>alignment</b> angle varies linearly with the shear rate S whereas for truly biaxial nematics it is independent of S. In a static external magnetic field the orthorhombic symmetry can be lost above a first critical field and uniaxiality can be reached above a second critical field.

40|$|In lyotropic liquid {{crystalline}} polymers, flow {{is known}} to induce either director tumbling or <b>flow</b> <b>alignment,</b> depending on the shear rate. Recently {{the existence of an}} intermediate transition region, a ''wagging'' regime, has been predicted on the basis of molecular theories. Here, rheological and rheo-optical techniques have been applied to assess the physical reality of the wagging regime in a solution of poly(benzyl glutamate). Stationary rheological and rheo-optical characteristics indicate a gradual change from tumbling to flow aligning when the shear rate is increased, without any divergent behavior in between. When transient measurement techniques are used, however, distinct differences can be observed over a very narrow shear rate range, immediately before the onset of <b>flow</b> <b>alignment.</b> This intermediate region is characterized by strongly fluctuating transients of the stresses and the linear conservative dichroism, especially when starting from a flow-aligned initial condition. In this manner evidence is provided for the existence of an intermediate regime, which can be associated with the predicted wagging regime. status: publishe...|$|R

The use of modified Cahn-Hilliard models {{to describe this}} phenomena is presented, along with experimental methods to measure flow-induced structure. It is demonstrated that the application of flow to polymer solutions can enhance concentration fluctuations in the direction perpendicular to the principal axis of strain, and produces butterfly shaped structure factors. Electric fields, on the other hand, distort fluctuations parallel to the applied field, and can induce a real shift of the coexistence curve. In viscoelastic surfactant solutions subject to flow, concentration fluctuations under go a transition from perpendicular <b>flow</b> <b>alignment</b> to parallel <b>flow</b> <b>alignment</b> on time scales associated with the breakage time of wormlike micelles...|$|R
