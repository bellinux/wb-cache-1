50|$|The {{single shaft}} five {{cylinder}} impulse-reaction turbine has a double flow arrangement for the I.P. cylinders {{as well as}} for the L.P. cylinders. There are double casings on H.P., I.P., and L.P. cylinders, and the last stages of the L.P. are fitted with 914.4 mm (36 in) blades. Stop valves and governor valves are situated at the inlet to the H.P. strainers and I.P. turbine. There are four 228.6 mm (9 in) bore main steam pipes, and four 431.8 mm (17 in) bore pipes on both the hot and <b>cold</b> <b>reheat</b> circuits to the turbine. In view of the size and increased volume of pipework compared to earlier designs, special attention was paid to mounting the valve chests as close to the machine as possible to reduce the stored energy effect of overspeed. For the H.P. valves this is done without actually mounting the valves on the cylinder, thus avoiding complication of the H.P. casing.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhen {{the unit}} is under normal operating, the steam source of plant-steam is from the fourth steam {{extraction}} of turbine. But at the low load operating condition, during the process that the steam source of plant steam switches to <b>reheat</b> <b>cold</b> section from the fourth steam extraction, steam power capability in the turbine is further reduced. In this paper, {{in order to improve}} the economy when the turbine is operating under the low load, <b>reheat</b> <b>cold</b> section steam is used as high-pressure steam to extract the fourth steam by the steam technology, which turns the low-pressure steam into the medium-pressure steam for recycling. This paper, taking 300 MW unit as an example, discusses the influence on the thermal economy of unit after putting the steam ejector into the plant steam system of thermal power plant...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the menus and food service experience of inmates in three correctional centres in Sydney (one minimum security, one high security, {{and one for}} women). Menus were evaluated against recommended dietary intakes, dietary guidelines and nutrition policy statements. Menus generally provided a well varied selection of foods which met the majority of individual nutritional requirements and dietary guidelines - assuming all food provided was consumed. Focus groups and interviews with 35 inmates explored their attitudes about and experiences of the foodservice provision. Sixteen key themes of concern were identified, including: • Complaints about food quality, lack of choice, and insufficient milk. • High self-reported levels waste of the hot evening meal. • Delivery of evening meals as early as 2. 30 pm and no facilities for inmates to keep meals <b>cold</b> or <b>reheat</b> them in cells. • Considerable use of additional purchased food (especially meat, fish and eggs). • Inmates commonly prepared meals in rice-cookers in their cells, sometimes re-using meal elements (like meat) from the cook-chill meals. Many complaints were related to factors outside {{the control of the}} food service management such as meal times, eating environment and lack of personal choice, but food and menu quality issues were also highlighted. Some of the inmate food handling practices may be posing unacceptable food safety risks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{studied the}} {{crystallization}} and melting phenomena of poly (3 - hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), a biodegradable and biocompatible semi-crystalline thermoplastic, obtained from renewable resources. Its high crystallinity motivated several studies on crystallization and melting behavior, {{and also on}} ways to increase the amorphous polymer fraction. The effect of heating and cooling rates on the crystallization and melting of commercial PHB was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. Several rates, ranging from 2. 5 to 20 °C min – 1, were used to study the phase changes during heating/cooling/reheating cycles. The results showed that PHB partially crystallizes from the melt during the cooling cycle and partially <b>cold</b> crystallizes on <b>reheating,</b> and that the relative amount of polymer crystallizing in each stage strongly depends on the cooling rate. The melt and cold crystallization temperatures, {{as well as the}} rates of phase change, depend strongly on the cooling and heating rates. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStable VN micro-alloying for WH 630 E {{steel plate}} can be {{achieved}} by utilization of blowing nitrogen at the bottom of BOF and refining process. Steel plate WH 630 E with thickness of 8 - 25 mm was rolled by TMCP process and was treated by normalizing. By comparing mechanical properties and microstructure changes in as-rolled plate and normalized plates, it was found out that ferrite grain size can be refined by normalizing process and the low temperature impact energy can be improved by normalizing. The main Strengthening mechanism for normalized WH 630 E steel plate was ferrite grain refining, grain refining plays a more stronger role than V(CN) precipitation strengthening. <b>Cold</b> crack and <b>reheated</b> crack can be avoided by preheating treatment with no more than 170 ̊C before welding WH 630 E plate, strength and toughness for welded joint can have good match with the base metal by the process of 15 ∼ 35 kJ/cm welding heat input energy and 500 ∼ 580 ̊C SR(stress relief) heat treatment. Yield strength of normalized high strength pressure vessel steel plate can be improved by VN micro-alloying, and then the wall thickness of pressure vessel can be thinned or operating pressure can be increased, therefore overall weight of transportable pressure vessel can be reduced, and there will be significant economic and social benefits for the application of this kind pressure vessel steel plate...|$|R
30|$|One {{of them is}} an {{application}} of the aforementioned backpressure turbine or extraction-backpressure turbine fed with outlet steam from the high-pressure turbine from the <b>cold</b> <b>reheat</b> steam line. The outlet steam together with the driving turbine bleeds (if any) would condense in low-pressure regenerative exchangers. Owing {{to the fact that}} outlet steam also gives up heat in the regenerative system, the extraction-backpressure turbine does not require a costly system of the condenser and cooling water which usually is the case with the condensing turbine driving the main feed pump.|$|E

In relation to this, a concept of the modification of the feed water heaters system by using an auxiliary extraction-backpressure turbine fed with steam from the <b>cold</b> <b>reheat</b> steam line is presented.

40|$|Steam line blowing is an {{operational}} cleaning method used to clean steam piping and reheaters prior to turbine powering for steam power plants. This paper focusses {{on the application}} and challenges associated with the steam blowing of large solar thermal collection power plants. The boiler configuration, located atop an over 400 foot tall tower, in a large solar thermal collection plant poses some challenges not associated with other steam supply methods. As {{a result of the}} flow path configurations and steam mass required for blowing the <b>cold</b> <b>reheat,</b> reheater, and hot reheat portions of the plant, attemperation is required to control temperatures in the reheater. The use of multiple flow paths and stages through the reheater also requires some additional consideration. Where in a fossil powered plant the losses through the reheater are based on the inlet vs. outlet conditions, additional vendor data is required to model the internal sections of the reheater in greater detail. Methodologies developed for fossil powered plants can be applied to large solar thermal collectors with special consideration for the unique configurations and constantly changing solar conditions associated with the plants. The smaller margins associated with these plants requires more rigorous modeling of the system components...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1994 The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) {{system for}} {{studying}} the food preparation process was conducted in four households in an environmentally poor urban neighborhood of Guayaquil, Ecuador. The analysis consisted of observing all of the steps in the food preparation process, measuring food temperatures at each step, and collecting food and water samples. Food and water samples were tested for total aerobic microorganisms, molds and yeast, total coliforms, and fecal coliforms. Temperatures reached during the cooking process were high enough to kill vegetative forms of foodborne pathogens; however, heat-resistant spores could have survived. Leftover food was held {{at room temperature for}} long periods of time which allowed multiplication of vegetative forms from spores or from contaminated food utensils. Leftover food was eaten either <b>cold</b> or <b>reheated</b> to warm temperatures. Water samples were taken from water delivery trucks and from each family. Water was identified as one of the main hazards in food preparation. None of the water samples met the criteria of the Ecuadorean National Institute of Standards for human consumption. Fecal samples were taken from children in the families, and were analyzed for parasites. Parasites were found in all of the samples. After critical control points were identified, appropriate interventions were taken to improve safety at each step. Based on these HACCP observations, a food and water safety program was designed and taught to five mothers attending a Guayaquil Child Care Center. The program included a lesson on each of four topics: food and water safety, parasites, care during diarrhea with emphasis on oral rehydration therapy and the introduction of solid food, and nutrition. A control mother was identified for each group. Diarrhea occurred in children of both groups but none of the children was hospitalized. With the exception of nutrition concepts, the knowledge about food and water safety concepts, parasites and care during diarrhea were well understood by both groups. This was reflected in positive changes in families' behavior toward using improved food and water sanitation practices as observed during a visit to each family which followed the HACCP study and the educational program...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} a new {{implementation of the}} Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics technique (SPH) designed to improve the realism with which galaxy formation can be simulated. In situations where cooling leads to the coexistence of phases of very different density and temperature, our method substantially reduces artificial overcooling near phase boundaries, prevents the exclusion of hot gas from the vicinity of cold "clouds", and allows relative motion of the two phases at each point. We demonstrate the numerical stability of our scheme {{in the presence of}} extremely steep density and temperature gradients, as well as in strong accretion shocks and cooling flows. In addition, we present new implementations of star formation and feedback which simulate the effect of energy injection into multiphase gas more successfully than previous schemes. Our feedback recipes deposit thermal energy separately in cold dense gas and hot diffuse gas, and can explicitly reinject cold gas into the hot phase. They make it possible to damp star formation effectively, to <b>reheat</b> <b>cold</b> gas, and to drive outflows into the galaxy halo and beyond. We show feedback effects to be strongest in small mass objects where much of the gas can be expelled. After idealised tests, we carry out a first low resolution study of galaxy formation in a ΛCDM universe. Feedback results in substantial and mass-dependent reductions in the total baryonic mass gathered onto the final object as well as in significant modulation of the star formation history.

40|$|The BHEL/NTPC/PFC/TVA teams {{assembled}} at the DVC`s Chadrapura {{station on}} July 19, 1994, {{to assess the}} remaining life of Unit 2. The workscope was expanded to include major plant systems that impact the unit`s ability to sustain generation at 140 MW (Units 1 - 3 have operated at average rating of about 90 MW). Assessment was completed Aug. 19, 1994. Boiler pressure parts are in excellent condition except for damage to primary superheater header/stub tubes and economizer inlet header stub tubes. The turbine steam path is in good condition except for damage to LP blading; the spar rotor steam path is in better condition and is recommended for Unit 2. Nozzle box struts are severely cracked from the flame outs; the cracks should not be repaired. HP/IP rotor has surface cracks at several places along the steam seal areas; these cracks are shallow and should be machined out. Detailed component damage assessments for above damaged components have been done. The turbine auxiliary systems have been evaluated; cooling tower fouling/blockage is the root cause for the high turbine back pressure. The fuel processing system {{is one of the}} primary root causes for limiting unit capacity.

40|$|The {{main results}} of the {{technical}} analysis were: For a 9 FA Three Pressure CCPP designed and strictly limited by the ISO case, approximately 7 additional MWe (2 % of the installed CCPP power) can be obtained at 30 C, at a gross thermal e ciency of 37 % by injecting to the steam cycle 21 MWth of solar heat with the saturated high pressure method. In {{the case of the}} <b>cold</b> <b>reheat</b> steam injected to the cycle, also approximately 7 MWe can be obtained at 3030 C of ambient temperature, at a gross thermal e ciency of almost 30 %. Comparing these results we can conclude that for obtaining the same amount of power output the size of the solar eld whit the SHP is smaller. We will use the SHP {{in the construction of the}} solar eld project. As the PTC technology has a better optical e ciency the amount of radiation absorbed per unit of surface is bigger than with PPC technology. That means that the land surface needed for the PTC technology is smaller than for the PPC technology. But the fact that the cost of the PPC technology is much smaller than the PTC technology, makes PPC a more attractive technology due to its higher pro tability. Taking into account that producing one kWh of electricity with conventional technologies costs about 5 - 6 ce=kWh we can conclude that the PPC allows us to obtain a competitive price of electricity by using a cleaner technology. That means that the construction of the solar eld for helping the CCPP is a feasible project and the initial investment will be recovered plus bene ts. Besides, running the solar eld for a range of temperatures between 0 C to 45 C, allows us to obtain higher radiation with approximately the same costs. The di erence between solar boosting and the increased solar boosting is the more expensive solar eld due to its wider extension, but with the bene ts of producing more solar energy and reducing the costs of electricity production.

40|$|AbstractTo {{fulfill the}} energy demand {{now and in}} the next decades, {{coal-fired}} power plants will be {{an essential part of the}} portfolio of power plants that supply electricity cheaply and in a reliable way. The specific CO 2 emissions of these plants can be reduced by increasing the efficiency. For that reason KEMA did optimize the steam water cycle of ultra super critical (USC) coal-fired power plants within the EOS program. The improvements are based on the application of the so-called Master Cycle, and on the application of higher steam temperatures. In the Master Cycle <b>cold</b> <b>reheat</b> steam is used in an extra turbine and with steam extraction of this turbine feed water preheating is realized with reduced exergy losses. The turbine is called a tuning turbine reflecting the improved possibilities to tune and optimize the steam cycle with the new coupling where the regenerative heater train and the re-heaters have been decoupled. The Master Cycle is proposed by Dong Energy . The first approach deals with the USC technology with a steam temperature of 600  °C and reheat temperatures of 620  °C. This technology is available at the moment and is applied in new built coal-fired power plants. The second approach deals with the USC technology with a steam temperature of 700  °C and reheat temperature of 720  °C. The expectation is that this technology can be applied around 2025 with the same availability as the USC units with 600  °C. The thermodynamic analyzes are carried out with KEMA’s flow sheeting package SPENCE®. In all considered cases the thermal input was 2400 MWth. In case of the application of the Master Cycle a second reheat is introduced. Results will be discussed and presented in tables, t-s diagrams and h-p diagrams. Improvement of efficiency of coal fired power station technology can reduce the amount of CO 2 emitted significantly. This paper shows that with current available technology and improvements an additional emission reduction of almost 10 % can be realised by applying the USC 700 + MC. Compared to the world wide average an emission reduction of 66 % can be achieved without CCS. In the continuation of the analysis post combustion technology will be integrated in the concept to analyze possible additional benefits of the master cycle with respect to steam supply for the regeneration of the solvents...|$|E
