5|$|Early {{speech or}} {{behavioral}} interventions can help <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although {{there is no}} known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.|$|E
5|$|Unusual eating {{behavior}} {{occurs in}} {{about three-quarters of}} children with ASD, {{to the extent that}} it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur; this does not appear to result in malnutrition. Although some <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> also have gastrointestinal symptoms, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual; studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and ASD is unclear.|$|E
5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this case study is to explore the {{interaction}} between a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> spectrum disorder and typically developing children among three-year-old-children.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effects of play materials on the interactions between a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> and her sibling.

5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show {{less attention to}} social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E
5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior.

These signs often develop gradually, though some <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.|$|E

40|$|Raising a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> {{generates a}} variety of issues for the family involved. It is a {{disorder}} that is particularly stressful for the family as a whole, and much research has shown elevated levels of stress in parents raising a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> (Dabrowska & Pisula, 2011; Lee, 2009).

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of}} a social story intervention with a social story plus behavior skills training intervention involving family members for a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism.</b> A multiple baseline across siblings design was used {{to assess the impact of}} the intervention on social interaction of the <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism,</b> as well as the social interaction of the child 2 ̆ 7 s siblings. The siblings implemented both phases of the intervention. Social validity measures were taken from the siblings and parents, treatment integrity and generalization were assessed as well. The results indicated that the social interactions of the <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> and the siblings increased initially, but did not continue to increase when the social story intervention was implemented by the siblings. The addition of BST did not result in any additional improvement. On the other hand, two of the siblings 2 ̆ 7 social interactions increased over time when engaged in the behavior skills training intervention, which resulted in an increase in the social interactions of the <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> during play <b>with</b> them.

A 2009 descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most individuals with autism, provides communication to those {{with little or no}} functional speech, and has some limited positive impact on social interaction and challenging behaviours. A study that compared the use of a speech generating device to a picture exchange system found that both were reasonable options for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism,</b> as the ease and speed of acquisition of each system was similar.|$|E

This study of the lived experience of parenting a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> provides an exploration of the experience within the framework of a hermeneutic phenomenological approach.
