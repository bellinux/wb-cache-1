50|$|The {{internal}} structure of precious opal makes it diffract light. Depending on {{the conditions in}} which it formed, it can take on many colors. Precious opal ranges from clear through white, gray, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, magenta, rose, pink, slate, olive, brown, and black. Of these hues, the black opals are the rarest, whereas white and greens are the most <b>common.</b> <b>Opals</b> vary in optical density from opaque to semitransparent.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{possibly}} antique cameo (Figure 1) has banding {{originating from}} the spectacular zonation of red, globular inclusions of microcrystalline hematite (Figures 2 to 5). It also contains disc-like to crescent-shaped hematite inclusions (Figures 4 and 6). Although its macroscopic appearance and refractive index (RI) are that of chalcedony, it fluoresces green to shortwave utraviolet radiation (Figure 7), when most chalcedonies are inert. Luminescence spectrometry {{proves that the}} green emission {{is similar to that}} of some <b>common</b> <b>opals,</b> with both intrinsic and uranium-related emissions (Figure 8). Raman spectrometry demonstrates by comparison with a reference chalcedony that there is additional signal similar to that of opal-CT (Figure 9). Hence this cameo is actually an intimate mixture of chalcedony and opal, opal giving its luminescence, and chalcedony its RI...|$|R

5000|$|Butterflies {{belonging}} to the family Lycaenidae, like the <b>Common</b> <b>Opal</b> (Chrysoritis thysbe), Dickson's Copper (Chrysoritis dicksoni) {{and other members of}} this genus, have a mutualistic relationship with various species of Crematogaster. The Lycaenidae and Crematogaster spp. are strongly associated with the fynbos growing in the Natal Drakensberg, and on Table Mountain Sandstone in the western and southern Cape. C. peringueyi also occurs at Jagersfontein, De Aar, Willowmore, Clanwilliam, Garies, Springbok, and Laingsburg.|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{high-quality}} stoichiometric indium phosphide by atmospheric pressure metal±organic {{chemical vapor deposition}} within thin-film artificial opals has been optimized. The optical properties of these systems have been studied {{as a function of}} the filling fraction. A consistent behavior has been found which substantially differs from that of other <b>common</b> infilled <b>opals.</b> The evolution of the InP morphology seems to be strongly correlated with this anomalous photonic response. At the first infiltration stages, the growth leads to the formation of nanocrystallites that eventually, as the infiltration increases, coalesce in single-crystalline grains of increasing size. The possibility to oxidize the material adds to its potential as a useful optical mate- rial...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeventy-seven gem opals {{from ten}} {{countries}} {{were analyzed by}} inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) through a dilution process, {{in order to establish}} the nature of the impurities. The results are correlated to the mode of formation and physical properties and are instrumental in establishing the geographical origin of a gem opal. The geochemistry of an opal is shown to be dependant mostly on the host rock, at least for examples from Mexico and Brazil, even if modified by weathering processes. In order of decreasing concentration, the main impurities present are Al, Ca, Fe, K, Na, and Mg (more than 500 ppm). Other noticeable elements in lesser amounts are Ba, followed by Zr, Sr, Rb, U, and Pb. For the first time, geochemistry helps to discriminate some varieties of opals. The Ba content, as well as the chondritenormalized REE pattern, are the keys to separating sedimentary opals (BaN 110 ppm, Eu and Ce anomalies) from volcanic opals (Bab 110 ppm, no Eu or Ce anomaly). The Ca content, {{and to a lesser extent}} that of Mg, Al, K and Nb, helps to distinguish gem opals from different volcanic environments. The limited range of concentrations for all elements in precious (play-of-color) compared to <b>common</b> <b>opals,</b> indicates that this variety must have very specific, or more restricted, conditions of formation. We tentatively interpreted the presence of impurities in terms of crystallochemistry, even if opal is a poorly crystallized or amorphous material. The main replacement is the substitution of Si 4 + by Al 3 + and Fe 3 +. The induced charge imbalance is compensated chiefly by Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Mn 2 +, Ba 2 +, K+, and Na+. In terms of origin of color, greater concentrations of iron induce darker colors (from yellow to "chocolate brown"). This element inhibits luminescence for concentrations above 1000 ppm, whereas already a low content in U (= 1 ppm) induces a green luminescence...|$|R
50|$|Visible light cannot {{pass through}} large {{thicknesses}} of the opal. This {{is the basis}} of the optical band gap in a photonic crystal. The notion that opals are photonic crystals for visible light was expressed in 1995 by Vasily Astratov's group. In addition, microfractures may be filled with secondary silica and form thin lamellae inside the opal during solidification. The term opalescence is commonly and erroneously used to describe this unique and beautiful phenomenon, which is correctly termed play of color. Contrarily, opalescence is correctly applied to the milky, turbid appearance of <b>common</b> or potch <b>opal.</b> Potch does not show a play of color.|$|R
50|$|Besides the {{gemstone}} {{varieties that}} show a play of color, the {{other kinds of}} <b>common</b> <b>opal</b> include the milk opal, milky bluish to greenish (which can sometimes be of gemstone quality); resin opal, which is honey-yellow with a resinous luster; wood opal, which {{is caused by the}} replacement of the organic material in wood with opal; menilite, which is brown or grey; hyalite, a colorless glass-clear opal sometimes called Muller's glass; geyserite, also called siliceous sinter, deposited around hot springs or geysers; and diatomite or diatomaceous earth, the accumulations of diatom shells or tests.|$|E
5000|$|This {{effect is}} most {{typically}} produced by adularia, {{from which the}} name derives. Adularescence appears in numerous other gemstones, notably <b>common</b> <b>opal,</b> rose quartz and agate. However, due to inclusions in these other stones, the effect is displayed differently. The schiller is scattered by inclusions and appears hazy; non-hazy specimens are specially referred to as [...] "milky". Thus, adularescence occurring in non-adularia gemstones is termed differently - the [...] "girasol effect" [...] and opalescence (for opals only) are two such terms. When the schiller forms an indistinct band, {{it is said to}} display a chatoyant effect. Only clearly defined bands are referred to as [...] "cat's eyes".|$|E
50|$|Various honeydew-producing insects such as aphids, scale {{insects and}} {{mealybugs}} are diligently {{protected by the}} ants. <b>Common</b> <b>Opal</b> larvae also produce honeydew from a gland on the back, leading to their being constantly guarded from predators such as parasitic wasps. The larvae at first feed and rest among the young leaves of the foodplant, but with the 3rd instar move to the plant's base. Here the ants extend their protection and hospitality by constructing papery daytime shelters for the larvae which feed by night on plants such as Bietou, and species of Aspalathus, Osteospermum and Zygophyllum. The larvae use these same shelters for pupating, the pupae also producing honeydew to ensure ant protection.|$|E
5000|$|The {{windows were}} sent to Shenandoah Stained Glass, an art glass {{restoration}} company, for repair. Workers spent three months hand-cleaning each piece of glass and fitting each window chosen for preservation into a new aluminum frame. According to stained glass restorer Mark Russel, the windows suffered significant fading damage due to sunlight and lack of care. Shenandoah workers discovered that the windows were made of <b>common</b> <b>opal</b> glass and high-quality [...] "cathedral glass" [...] from the Kokomo Opalescent Glass Works in Kokomo, Indiana. To repair the windows, Shenandoah Stained Glass found identically-colored opal or Kokomo-produced glass and glazed it to replace broken pieces. The large religious-themed window (which was 10 by 10 ft square) proved too expensive to restore, and five others were too heavily damaged to repair. These windows were partially cannibalized to restore the others. Fragments of glass were also collected {{from the floor of}} the mausoleum, and used to reconstruct the remaining windows. Epoxy was used to fill in small cracks and chips.|$|E
5000|$|For {{gemstone}} use, most opal is cut {{and polished}} {{to form a}} cabochon. [...] "Solid" [...] opal refers to polished stones consisting wholly of precious opal. Opals too thin to produce a [...] "solid" [...] may be combined with other materials to form attractive gems. An opal doublet consists of a relatively thin layer of precious opal, backed by a layer of dark-colored material, most commonly ironstone, dark or black <b>common</b> <b>opal</b> (potch), onyx, or obsidian. The darker backing emphasizes the play of color, and results in a more attractive display than a lighter potch. An opal triplet {{is similar to a}} doublet, but has a third layer, a domed cap of clear quartz or plastic on the top. The cap takes a high polish and acts as a protective layer for the opal. The top layer also acts as a magnifier, to emphasize the play of color of the opal beneath, which is often of lower quality. Triplet opals therefore have a more artificial appearance, and are not classed as precious opal. Jewelry applications of precious opal can be somewhat limited by opal's sensitivity to heat due primarily to its relatively high water content and predisposition to scratching.Combined with modern techniques of polishing, doublet opal produces a similar effect to black or boulder opal {{at a fraction of the}} price. Doublet opal also has the added benefit of having genuine opal as the top visible and touchable layer, unlike triplet opals.|$|E

40|$|A new opal deposit was {{discovered}} in 2008 {{near the village of}} Wegel Tena, in volcanic rocks of Ethiopia's Wollo Province. Unlike previous Ethiopian opals, the new material is mostly white, with some brown opal, fire opal, and colorless "crystal" opal. Some of it resembles Australian and Brazilian sedimentary opals, with play-of-color that is often very vivid. However, its properties are consistent with those of opal-CT and most volcanic opals. Inclusions consist of pyrite, barium-manganese oxides, and native carbon Some samples show "digit patterns", interpenetrating play-of-color and <b>common</b> <b>opal,</b> resembling fingers. The opaque-to-translucent Wegel Tena opals become transparent when soaked in water, showing a remarkable hydrophane character. White opals from this deposit contain an elevated Ba content, which has not been reported so far in opal-CT. The fire and crystal opals are prone to breakage, while the white, opaque-to-translucent opals are remarkably durable. The proportion of gem-quality material in the Wegel Tena deposit seems unusually high, and 1, 500 kg have already been extracted using rudimentary mining techniques. The deposit may extend over several kilometers and could become a major source of gem-quality opa...|$|E
40|$|Gemstone {{minerals}} in Serbia {{have never}} been regarded as an interesting and significant resource. Nevertheless, more than 150 deposits and occurrences have been recorded {{and some of them}} preliminarily explored in the last 50 years. The majority of deposits and occurrences are located within the Serbo-Macedonian metallogenic province and the most significant metallogenic units at the existing level of knowledge are the Fruska Gora ore district, Cer ore district, Sumadija metallogenic zone, Kopaonik metallogenic zone and Lece-Halkidiki metallogenic zone. The most important genetic type of deposits is hydrothermal, particularly in case of serpentinite/peridotite as host/parent rock. Placer deposits are also economically important. The dominant gemstones are silica minerals: chalcedony (Chrysoprase, carnelian, bluish chalcedony etc.), jasper (picture, landscape, red etc.), <b>common</b> <b>opal</b> (dendritic, green, milky white etc.), silica masses (undivided), and quartz (rock crystal, amethyst etc.). Beside silica minerals significant gemstones in Serbia include also beryl (aquamarine), garnet (almandine and pyrope), tourmaline, fluorite, rhodochrosite, carbonate-silica breccia, carbonate-silica onyx, silicified wood, howlite, serpentinite, marble onyx, and kyanite. This paper aims to present an overview of Serbian gemstone deposits and occurrences and their position based on a simplified gemstone metallogenic map of Serbia, as well as genetic-industrial classification of gemstone deposits and gemstone varieties...|$|E
40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. 476. Besides {{the famous}} {{precious}} opals from Eastern Slovakia, the Neogene volcanic field in Central Slovakia shows numerous localities with {{various types of}} opals. Unfortunately these localities contain only <b>common</b> <b>opal</b> (or potch opal), but moreover, there are only few information on mineralogical composition or genesis of such opal types in Slovakian geological literature. Common opals are bound to all types of volcanic rocks and their pyroclastics. They {{can be found in}} fissures and cracks in basaltic, andesitic as well as in rhyolitic rocks. The Cigel' locality was chosen from the number of different opal localities based on the well preserved cross sections through the andesitic volcanic rocks and redeposited pyroclastics of Vtáčnik Formation (Šimon et al. 1997) Opals can be found in irregular nodules of variable size in weathered redeposited pyroclastic materials as well as in fissures and cracks in fresh andesitic rocks. Opals are often associated with greenish clays, which are often intimately overgrown with opal, or they create a thin crust around the opal nodules. Also they create infilling of fissures in weathered pyroclastic material. Selected samples of opal were studied using optical microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction analyses (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and electron microprobe (EMPA) in order to determine their exact mineralogical and chemical composition. Both types of opals samples (nodules and infilling of cracks in fresh andesite) shows typical PXRD pattern for opal-CT (Floerke et al. 1991, Graetsch 1994) with presence of expandable layer silicates. Etched surfaces of samples show presence of lepispheres (Floerke et al. 1975) of opal-CT in SEM. Based on IR analyses the associated clays consist mainly of nontronite, kaolinite was detected in lower amount. Chemical composition of opals is quite variable. Samples are not homogenous, they show two different phases which are either poor or rich on trivalent compounds. With increasing amount of trivalent compounds the content of SiO 2 is getting lower, but the concentration of divalent and monovalent impurities is significantly getting higher. As for comparison phases poor on trivalent compound shows concentration of Al 2 O 3 up to 0. 01 wt. % and Fe 2 O 3 up to 0. 2 wt. %. The concentration of SiO 2 in this phase reaches up to 99. 2 wt. %. Phase rich on trivalent compounds shows concentration of Al 2 O 3 up to 2. 7 wt. % and 23. 3 wt. % for Fe 2 O 3. SiO 2 concentration reaches 64. 3 - 83. 4 wt. %. Besides the opal phases, also impurities with high concentrations of MnO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 were identified. Sums over 100 wt. % belong to moganite, which was subsequently identified by the means of Raman spectroscopy. Based on the field observations, detected mineralogical features and chemical composition, an infiltration-weathering formation of opal was proposed. The proposed process includes low-temperature hydration of volcanic glass (smectititzation) in solid state (Šamajova et al. 1992, Velde & Meunier 2008). Access of silica is transported by descending fluids and subsequently the opal can be precipitated in fissures or in cracks (Koivula et al. 1983, Horton 2002) between the weathered pyroelastic materials or in cracks and fissures in fresh andesite.
