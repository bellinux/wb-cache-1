2500|$|The {{difficulties}} in identifying separate subspecies, or even species, is pronounced. Hernández-Camacho and Cooper reported some specimens of capuchin from the Barranquilla animal market had supposedly {{come from the}} middle valley of the San Jorge River. It {{is difficult to determine}} whether these are white-headed capuchins (Cebus capucinus) or white-fronted capuchins. Intermediate characteristics include a dark crown that is high and removed from the forehead. The white parts on the face are more distinctively bald and the outside parts of the arms and legs are more clear; this suggests they are white-headed capuchin. Some specimens of C. a. versicolor seen in the market at Magangué‚ and probably captured in the lower Cauca River, show similar tendencies to the above, except that there is no increase in the dark pigmentation. Based on these observations and on various [...] "intermediate" [...] specimens from northern Colombia, it seems possible that an investigation of the contact zone between the white-headed capuchin and white-fronted capuchin ultimately could show that these forms are conspecific. Another <b>critical</b> <b>zone</b> for this analysis is an area in northeast Ecuador where C. a. aecuatoriales and white-headed capuchin are found, although neither sympatric distributions or intergradation have as yet been determined.|$|E
40|$|In {{air-conditioning}} systems serving multiple zones, conventional ventilation strategies often result in over-ventilation in some zones with under-ventilation {{in the other}} zones when the heating/cooling load and occupancy profiles of zones differ greatly. This article presents an adaptive demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) strategy for multi-zone {{air-conditioning systems}}, which employs real-time occupancy identification using the dynamic multi-zone ventilation equation and zone temperature set-point reset of <b>critical</b> <b>zones.</b> The strategy identifies the <b>critical</b> <b>zones,</b> and fully considers the outdoor air demand of <b>critical</b> <b>zones</b> and the unvitiated outdoor air in the re-circulated air from the other zones. The air temperature reset of <b>critical</b> <b>zones</b> results in the increase of their supply air fractions and therefore the amount of outdoor air delivered to the <b>critical</b> <b>zones.</b> Consequently the total outdoor airflow demand and the overall energy consumption are reduced while the ventilation of <b>critical</b> <b>zones</b> is satisfied. This adaptive DCV strategy is validated by comparing its energy and environmental performances with other typical ventilation strategies under various weather conditions.

40|$|For ships {{operating}} in arctic and sub-arctic waters, ice load {{is a major}} threat. Due to the uncertainties in ice conditions and varying operating situations, an accurate estimation on design ice load is difficult. The objective of the present research is to investigate the ice loads and the associated structural strength from aspects of mechanics, statistics and design principles. [...] First, the ice-structure interaction process is investigated from the view point of mechanics. The interaction is characterized by ice fracture and damage. The ice load is highly localized within high pressure regions termed <b>critical</b> <b>zones.</b> A numerical analysis was carried out to investigate how a crack may propagate in an ice sheet and how the ice material is damaged during an ice-structure interaction. The analysis showed that small shear cracks, with mixed modes, are more likely the candidates for the fracture spalls {{and the formation of}} <b>critical</b> <b>zones.</b> [...] <b>Critical</b> <b>zones</b> vary in space and time. These <b>critical</b> <b>zones</b> are characterized using parameters such as spatial density, zonal area, and the zonal force. These parameters in the model were calibrated using ship trial data of CCGS Louis St. Laurent. The ice loads on a design area were modelled as a random number of <b>critical</b> <b>zones,</b> each with a random force. Based on this model and extreme value theory, a design curve was proposed for the estimation of extreme ice loads. [...] Third, the strength of the structure was investigated. A long plate, loaded by uniform pressure was proposed as the design model for the plating. Due to the randomness of ice load, there are uncertainties associated with the design model. To understand this uncertainty, various load scenarios were investigated using the finite element method. The results show that the plate fails at a dominant section, which fails in a way similar to an "equivalent long plate". Factors affecting the failure of the panel are lateral support and interaction between <b>critical</b> <b>zones.</b> These factors were investigated and empirical formula were derived based on finite element modelling. [...] A simplified model was proposed to investigate the failure of the "equivalent long plate". This model was used, together with factors of lateral support, location and interactions between <b>critical</b> <b>zones</b> from empirical formula, in Monte Carlo simulation scheme to model the uncertainty of the design model of the structure. The simulated results of the uncertainty factor were approximated by a lognormal distribution. [...] Finally, the results from the analysis on the ice loads and the structural resistance were used in discussion of the design principles. Two design methods, i. e., reliability design and code design methods, were discussed. Principles in selecting design load and resistance were discussed. These principles were applied in an example design of an offshore oil tanker. Reliability of the plates from different design strategies were evaluated. It was found that, for ultimate rupture, a yearly maximum with a probability of exceedance of 10 ⁻⁴ is appropriate as the design load...|$|R
