In The New York Times, Stanley Kauffmann wrote: [...] "Miss Lansbury is a singing-dancing actress, not {{a singer}} or dancer who also acts...

Lansbury's later biographer Margaret Bonanno claimed that Mame made Lansbury a [...] "superstar", with the actress herself commenting on her success by stating that [...] "Everyone loves you, everyone loves the success, and enjoys {{it as much as}} you do.

500|$|Actor Mickey Rourke asked Bowie to be {{involved}} in one of the songs, the two having met in London where Rourke was based while filming the movie A Prayer for the Dying. Bowie had him perform the mid-song rap to the song [...] "Shining Star (Makin' My Love)." [...] Bowie jokingly referred to Rourke's performance as [...] "method rapping". Bowie described the song as one that [...] "reflects back-to-street situations, and how people are trying to get together in the face of so many disasters and catastrophes, socially around them, never knowing if they're going to survive it themselves. The one thing they have got to cling on to is each other; although it might resolve into something terrible, it's the only thing that they've got. It’s just a little love song <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> environment." [...] He rejected the notion that his [...] "high, little" [...] voice (which he attributed to Smokey Robinson) in the song was a new character (to follow behind Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke), instead saying it was just what the song needed, as he had tried the song in his regular voice and did not like the outcome: [...] "That never bothered me, changing voices to suit a song. You can fool about with it." [...] "Shining Star" [...] was one of Bowie's early choices to be a single for the album, but EMI had the final say and did not release the song as a single. A 12" [...] remix of the song was made available on iTunes when the [...] " [...] was released digitally {{for the first time in}} 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Ahead of {{the annual}} Board of Governors meeting where they were {{expected}} to vote on approval of the sale of the Kings to Hansen and Ballmer's group, as well as the relocation request, members of the NBA owners' finance and relocation committees held a meeting in New York City on April 3, 2013, for the Seattle group and the Sacramento group to each present their proposals. Any vote would only be on the PSA presented by Hansen and Ballmer, and the Sacramento proposal was considered a [...] "backup offer". <b>Coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> meeting, the NBA removed the vote from the agenda of the BOG meeting and postponed it for two weeks while information was reviewed. Despite stated desires to the contrary, a bidding war began between Hansen's and Ranadivé's groups, including Hansen raising the team valuation of their offer twice from $525 million to $550 million to $625 million, and Ranadivé offering to forgo the team revenue sharing that has frequently kept smaller market teams like the Kings financially stable.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2011, Scherzinger {{announced}} that the musically diverse music she recorded had a bittersweet theme in which she titled the album, Killer Love, saying [...] "I wrote 'Killer Love' about a tortured love. Where you can't {{get enough of the}} love but it's not good for you. And I guess when the fans listen to the album, I want them to {{know that a lot of}} the music that I chose had to do with my past experiences and relationships, where I've lost myself many times. It's [...] being lost and broken and in a very fearful, dark place and the process [...] <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> It's a very empowering album but it comes from a place of heartbreak." [...] On March 2, 2011, Rap-Up revealed the cover art along with the track listing for Killer Love. On the standard cover, Scherzinger strikes a comfy pose, cracking a half-smile with a tuft of gray fur draped over her left shoulder. On October 20, 2011, the re-release cover was released with Scherzinger smiling coyly and draped lightly in a loose, unidentified, furry and wind-blown article of clothing similar to the first cover.|$|E

So the reason we’re all here today is not because some politician needs to knock off one more thing on his ‘to do’ list. We are here because we have a President, who is true, is a true man of God. A man who prays every day. And I think together, we can really make a difference for mankind, for Americans, we can make America a better place. We can, and I enjoyed the prayer, as we began, served, getting food.

60|$|The {{turning to}} the right, which was {{his way to his}} hotel, was only a very few steps farther. He stopped again (all the houses of the sea-front were shut up, the {{quayside}} was deserted, but for one or two figures of natives walking in the distance) and began to reckon the amount of his bill. So many days in the hotel at so many dollars a day. To count the days he used his fingers: plunging one hand into his pocket, he jingled a few silver coins. All right for three days more; and then, unless something turned up, he must break into the five hundred--Ivy's money--invested in her father. It seemed to him that the first meal <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> reserve would choke him--for certain. Reason was of no use. It was a matter of feeling.

It is very true, by this faithful Discharge of my Trust, I did save the Government one Thousand Pounds; but it is equally so, that I never had of my Governors one Farthing Consideration for what others term'd an over-officious Piece of Service; though in Justice it must be own'd a Piece of exact and disinterested Duty.|$|E
60|$|I was {{surprise}}d, I must confess, to meet President Kruger in Somersetshire {{during the}} war. I {{had no idea}} {{that he was in the}} neighbourhood. But a yet more arresting surprise awaited me. Mr. Kruger regarded me for some moments with a dubious grey eye, and then addressed me with a strong Somersetshire accent. A curious cold shock went through me to hear that inappropriate voice <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> familiar form. It was as if you met a Chinaman, with pigtail and yellow jacket, and he began to talk broad Scotch. But the next moment, of course, I understood the situation. We had much underrated the Boers in supposing that the Boer education was incomplete. In pursuit of his ruthless plot against our island home, the terrible President had learnt not only English, but all the dialects at a moment's notice to win over a Lancashire merchant or seduce a Northumberland Fusilier. No doubt, if I asked him, this stout old gentleman could grind out Sussex, Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, and so on, like the tunes in a barrel organ. I could not wonder if our plain, true-hearted German millionaires fell before a cunning so penetrated with culture as this.|$|E

6000|$|Jimmy Fort {{walked away}} from Camelot Mansions that evening in extreme {{discomfort}} of mind. Leila had been so queer {{that he had taken}} leave immediately after supper. She had refused to talk about Noel; had even seemed angry when he had tried to. How extraordinary some women were! Did they think that a man could hear of a thing like that about such a dainty young creature without being upset! It was the most perfectly damnable news! What on earth would she do--poor little fairy princess! Down had come her house of cards with a vengeance! The whole of her life--the whole of her life! With her bringing-up and her father and all--it seemed inconceivable that she could ever survive it. And Leila had been almost callous about the monstrous business. Women were hard to each other! Bad enough, these things, when it was a simple working girl, but this dainty, sheltered, beautiful child! No, it was altogether too strong--too painful! And following an impulse which he could not resist, {{he made his way to}} the old Square. But having reached the house, he nearly went away again. While he stood hesitating with his hand on the bell, a girl and a soldier passed, appearing as if by magic out of the moonlit November mist, blurred and solid shapes embraced, then vanished into it again, leaving the sound of footsteps. Fort jerked the bell. He was shown into what seemed, to one <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> mist, to be a brilliant, crowded room, though in truth there were but two lamps and five people in it. They were sitting round the fire, talking, and paused when he came in. When he had shaken hands with Pierson and been introduced to [...] "my daughter Gratian" [...] and a man in khaki [...] "my son-in-law George Laird," [...] to a tall thin-faced, foreign-looking man in a black stock and seemingly no collar, he went up to Noel, who had risen from a chair before the fire. 'No!' he thought, 'I've dreamed it, or Leila has lied!' She was so perfectly the self-possessed, dainty maiden he remembered. Even the feel of her hand was the same-warm and confident; and sinking into a chair, he said: [...] "Please go on, and let me chip in." ...|$|E
