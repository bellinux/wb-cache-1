Outside the <b>centre</b> <b>stands</b> a bronze statue of Thomas, by John Doubleday. Another monument to Thomas stands in Cwmdonkin Park, one of his favourite childhood haunts, close to his birthplace. The memorial is a small rock in an enclosed garden within the park inscribed with the closing lines from Fern Hill.|$|E

The subject of the Memorial is the Greek god Anteros and was given the name The Angel of Christian Charity but is generally mistaken for his brother Eros.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the main}} portal {{is one of}} the most {{complete}} Late Gothic sculpture collections in Europe. This collection represents the Christian belief in a Last Judgment where the wicked will be separated from the righteous. This sculpture shows the wicked naked on the right, while the righteous stand clothed in white on the left. In the center is Justice, with Saints and the wise and foolish virgins around her.

25|$|Hatley Park. This superb {{example of}} an Edwardian park was laid out for James and Laura Dunsmuir in the early 20th century. At its <b>centre</b> <b>stands</b> a Tudor Revival mansion, whose picturesque design is {{enhanced}} by a rich array of decoration and fine craftmanship. The grounds, featuring a variety of native and exotic vegetation, unfold from formal gardens to recreational spaces, farmlands and forests. Acquired by the Canadian armed forces in 1940, Hatley Park evolved {{to meet the needs}} of Royal Roads Military College in a manner that has preserved its essential Edwardian character.|$|E
25|$|In Stockport, {{six miles}} south of Manchester, four sets of {{underground}} air raid shelter tunnels for civilian use were dug into the red sandstone on which the town <b>centre</b> <b>stands.</b> Preparation started in September 1938 and {{the first set of}} shelters was opened on 28 October 1939. (Stockport was not bombed until 11 October 1940.) The smallest of the tunnel shelters could accommodate 2,000 people and the largest 3,850 (subsequently expanded to take up to 6,500 people.) The largest of the Stockport Air Raid Shelters {{are open to the public}} as part of the town's museum service.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some other}} great houses, its {{exterior}} was austere and not adorned with pediments or pilasters. For some, this {{gave it a}} noble simplicity. For others, it seemed unremarkable and undermined the case for preservation. Its exterior contrasted with a richly ornate and well-proportioned interior. The interior had carved marble chimneypieces, many elaborate ceilings and plasterwork of a high quality. There was a book room, a classical stone staircase with medallioned walls and a circular room with a groined ceiling. In the long parlour there was a painted ceiling by Riley, a student of Joshua Reynolds. Frescati even had its own theatre with Corinthian columns. Jacob Smith, who also worked at Carton and Russborough, landscaped and devised the large formal gardens filled with rare plants and shrubs. The house stood well back from the road on several acres of woods and parkland, and the Priory Stream passed through its grounds. There was also a small seawater pool in the garden. The gateway stood close to where {{the entrance to the}} Blackrock Shopping <b>Centre</b> <b>stands</b> today and its lands stretched back to where Sydney Avenue is now located.|$|E

2500|$|This novel type of {{psychiatric}} care was evaluated by various other institutions {{around the world}} (see for instance Eastern State Hospital in Virginia), but often seen as too revolutionary to implement. [...] It {{is only in the}} early 20th century that the idea of deinstitutionalization was adopted more widely elsewhere. [...] Today, a modern psychiatric <b>centre</b> <b>stands</b> on the place of the old infirmary, and close to 500 patients are still placed with inhabitants.|$|E
2500|$|The Normans {{reinforced}} the area by building two castles inside the Roman walls that ran north-south, giving their {{name to the}} street of Old Bailey and then roughly following the modern Blackfriars Lane down to the Thames. Baynard's Castle was built where the wall met the river overlooking {{the mouth of the}} Fleet, roughly where the Bank of New York's Mellon <b>Centre</b> <b>stands</b> at 160 Queen Victoria Street. [...] Montfichet's Tower was further north on Ludgate Hill overlooking the strategic route west, through Ludgate and over the Fleet, that would become Fleet Street.|$|E

2500|$|The Media Centre was {{commissioned}} {{in time for}} the 1999 Cricket World Cup, and was the first all-aluminium, semi-monocoque building in the world. It was built and fitted out in two boatyards, using boat-building technology. The <b>centre</b> <b>stands</b> [...] above the ground and its sole support comes from the structure around its two lift shafts it is about the same height as the Pavilion directly opposite it {{on the other side of}} the ground. The lower tier of the centre provides accommodation for over 100 journalists, and the top tier has radio and television commentary boxes. The centre's only opening window is in the broadcasting box used by BBC Test Match Special. The building was awarded the RIBA Stirling Prize for architecture in 1999.|$|E
2500|$|Telford {{town centre}} lies about [...] east/south-east of Shrewsbury and [...] north-west of Wolverhampton. The town {{comprises}} 7,803 hectares (30.13 square miles) and its {{southern and eastern}} parts, between the Severn Gorge and Donnington Wood, include the East Shropshire coalfield. North and north-west Telford lie beyond the coalfield's boundary fault on sandstone beds which, along with other Triassic formations, prevail {{over much of the}} North Shropshire plain. The town <b>centre</b> <b>stands</b> on a watershed, with land to the south draining towards the River Severn, and to the north the land slopes gently down towards the Weald Moors. The town is dominated by the Wrekin, a large hill of 407m (1335ft), located south-west of Wellington, straddling the border with the unitary Shropshire Council (before the latter's creation in 2009 the borough of Shrewsbury and Atcham).|$|E

2500|$|The [...] {{tower of}} Bridgewater Place, {{also known as}} The Dalek, {{is part of a}} major office and {{residential}} development and the region's tallest building; it can be seen for miles around. Bridgewater Place {{has been the subject of}} debate as its erection in 2007 caused significant Wind Tunnel effects, channeling strong wind currents across Victoria Road. There have been numerous injuries attributed to the inadequate architecture of this building and Water Lane is frequently closed when high winds are expected. Leeds City Council are undertaking construction work in an attempt to deflect the wind from street level and the building owners of Bridgewater Place agreed to pay to cover the public money being spent. Among other Skyscrapers the 37-storey Sky Plaza to the north of the city <b>centre</b> <b>stands</b> on higher ground so that its [...] is higher than Bridgewater Place.|$|E

6000|$|I {{presently}} {{found out}} that he called my pocket compass, [...] "Mbwiri," [...] a very vague and comprehensive word. It represents in the highest signification the Columbian Manitou, and thus men talk of the Mbwiri of a tree or a river; as will presently be seen, it is also applied to a tutelar god; and I have shown how it means a ghost. In [...] "Nágo Mbwiri" [...] the sense is an idol, an object of worship, a [...] "medicine" [...] as the North-American Indians say, in contradistinction to Munda, a grigri, talisman, or charm. Every Mpongwe, woman as well as man, has some Mbwiri to which offerings are made in times of misfortune, sickness, or danger. I afterwards managed to enter one of these rude and embryonal temples so carefully shut. Behind the little door of matting is a tall threshold of board; a bench lines the far end, and in the <b>centre</b> <b>stands</b> [...] "Ologo," [...] a rude imitation of a human figure, with a gum-torch planted in the ground before it ready for burnt offerings. To the walls are suspended sundry mystic implements, especially basins, smeared with red and white chalk-mixture, and wooden crescents decorated with beads and ribbons.|$|E
