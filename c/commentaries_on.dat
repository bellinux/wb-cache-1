5|$|Calvin {{produced}} <b>commentaries</b> <b>on</b> most of {{the books}} of the Bible. His first commentary on Romans was published in 1540, and he planned to write <b>commentaries</b> <b>on</b> the entire New Testament. Six years passed before he wrote his second, a commentary on First Epistle to the Corinthians, but after that he devoted more attention to reaching his goal. Within four years he had published <b>commentaries</b> <b>on</b> all the Pauline epistles, and he also revised the commentary on Romans. He then {{turned his attention to}} the general epistles, dedicating them to Edward VI of England. By 1555 he had completed his work on the New Testament, finishing with the Acts and the Gospels (he omitted only the brief second and third Epistles of John and the Book of Revelation). For the Old Testament, he wrote <b>commentaries</b> <b>on</b> Isaiah, the books of the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and Joshua. The material for the commentaries often originated from lectures to students and ministers that he reworked for publication. From 1557 onwards, he could not find the time to continue this method, and he gave permission for his lectures to be published from stenographers' notes. These Praelectiones covered the minor prophets, Daniel, Jeremiah, Lamentations, and part of Ezekiel.|$|E
