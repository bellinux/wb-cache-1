5|$|In a December 2013 interview, Nirbhaya's parents, Badri Nath Singh and Asha Devi, {{said they}} were trying to get the {{juvenile}} law changed in such crimes as the rape and murder of their daughter. They petitioned the Supreme Court to try the juvenile, just short of 18 when he <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime,</b> in a criminal court instead of a Juvenile Justice court.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after {{accepting}} the offer, Apollo is assigned to investigate three separate incidents: a hit-and-run involving Phoenix, the theft of a noodle vendor's cart, and the disappearance of Trucy's favorite pair of panties. At the same time, the Kitaki crime family hires him to defend one of their own, Wocky Kitaki, in a murder trial concerning the death of Dr. Pal Meraktis. By connecting the incidents to evidence recovered {{with the help of}} Detective Ema Skye, Apollo discredits the case against Wocky by proving that his fiancée, Alita Tiala, {{was the only one who}} could have <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under {{the current}} law {{there are two}} {{applications}} of the insanity defence; where it is claimed that the defendant was insane {{at the time that}} he <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime,</b> and where it is claimed that he was insane at the time of the trial and thus unable to effectively defend himself. The defence is most commonly used in the Crown Court, since it was previously believed that it required a jury; in DPP v Harper , it was decided that the defence could also be applied in the Magistrates' Court.|$|E

5|$|Mussolini sent a warship {{to shell}} the Greek island of Corfu, and Italian forces {{occupied}} the island on 31 August 1923. This contravened the League's covenant, so Greece {{appealed to the}} League {{to deal with the}} situation. The Allies agreed (at Mussolini's insistence) that the Conference of Ambassadors should be responsible for resolving the dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini. The League Council examined the dispute, but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> were never discovered. Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu.|$|E
5|$|An {{accomplice}} {{could be}} sued {{if he had}} provided help ope consilio – a physical act relating to the method of execution, rather than mere encouragement. It appears that Labeo {{was the first to}} require help or advice, and earlier sources suggest that both help and advice was required. Labeo's version was certainly entrenched by the early second century AD. An accomplice was treated as if he himself had <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime.</b> Only one person needed to have handled the thing for all wrongdoers to be liable. Republican jurists were harder on accomplices than later jurists under the empire. Indeed, Ulpian considers the unwitting accomplice, who accidentally knocks out of the victim's hand some coins which are then stolen, an accomplice to the theft. Some commentators have gone as far to say that the veteres ("ancients") may not have even required a third party to remove the coins, {{as long as they were}} otherwise lost to the owner.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{stops by}} the Kwik-E-Mart {{on the way}} home from work, and {{witnesses}} a robbery committed by a masked clown, resembling Krusty. He identifies the clown as Krusty to the police, and Krusty is arrested, upsetting Bart, who considers him to be his idol. During his trial the next day, Krusty is revealed to be illiterate. After being called out to the stand, Homer points out Krusty as the robber, and he is convicted and sentenced to jail. The community then gathers up in a public burning as they burn up all of Krusty's merchandise. Krusty's sidekick Sideshow Bob becomes the new host of his show, making it a more educational program. Still refusing to accept that his hero could have <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime,</b> Bart enlists the help of a reluctant Lisa and they set out to prove Krusty's innocence.|$|E

5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public {{has been reduced to}} making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E

50|$|The {{burden of}} proof is on the {{prosecution}} in a criminal trial. This means the prosecution must prove {{beyond a reasonable doubt}} that the defendant is guilty of <b>the</b> <b>crime.</b> As <b>the</b> defense does not have this burden, it must only prove that it is reasonable possible that the defendant did not <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime.</b> <b>The</b> defense does not have to prove the defendant definitely did not <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime,</b> only that it is possible he did not do it.|$|R

25|$|The third, a {{somewhat}} rarer, {{function is to}} explain (precise) another verb by indicating a secondary action of which the subject is the agent: Kaltinamasis prisipažįsta padaręs nusikaltimą ir labai dėl to gailisi. – The defendant confesses having <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> and sincerely regrets it. If the subject is not the agent expressed in the nominative case of a noun or a pronoun, an adverbial participle must be used instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of innocence is only rejected when an error is very unlikely, because one doesn't want to convict an innocent defendant. Such an error is called error {{of the first}} kind (i.e., the conviction of an innocent person), and the occurrence of this error is controlled to be rare. As a consequence of this asymmetric behaviour, an error of the second kind (acquitting a person who <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime),</b> is more common.|$|E

In a 1981 interview with Fangoria magazine, Hill mentions the finished film differs somewhat from initial drafts of the screenplay. The plot twist of Laurie being Michael's sister required a retcon of the timeline between Judith's murder and the events depicted in the first Halloween; while Michael Myers {{is said to have}} <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> fifteen years ago and to be twenty-one.|$|E

Again, Pintarić was drunk when he <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime,</b> and had no recollection of the event on the following day. Only after inquiring about what had happened in Zabok, he realized that he had murdered his wife.|$|E
25|$|On August 8, 1972, DuMond {{was charged}} with murder in Lawton, Oklahoma. He <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> with help from two other men. DuMond used the 17-year-old {{daughter}} {{of one of his}} accomplices to entice the victim to an isolated location, where DuMond and his accomplices beat him to death with a claw hammer. Prosecutors did not charge DuMond after he agreed to testify against the two others, though he admitted in court that he was among those who attacked the murder victim.|$|E

25|$|The {{more severe}} {{penalties}} available in criminal law {{also means that}} it requires a higher burden of proof to be discharged than the related tort. For example, in the O. J. Simpson murder trial, the jury was not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that O. J. Simpson had <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> of murder; but in a later civil trial, the jury in that case decided that there was sufficient evidence to meet the standard of preponderance of the evidence required to prove the tort of wrongful death.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, the Vatican Bank {{agreed to}} pay US$224 million to the 120 of Banco Ambrosiano {{creditors}} as a “recognition of moral involvement” in the bank's collapse. Whether the Vatican Bank was {{directly involved in the}} scandal cannot be legally confirmed, {{due to a lack of}} evidence in the subpoenaed correspondence revealing only that Calvi consistently supported the religious agenda of the Vatican. As it was Calvi who <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> of fiscal misconduct and there was no evidence of church involvement otherwise, the Vatican was granted immunity.|$|E
25|$|Proof {{beyond a}} {{reasonable}} doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that one {{would be willing to}} rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of one's own affairs. However, it does not mean an absolute certainty. The standard that must be met by the prosecution's evidence in a criminal prosecution is that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime,</b> thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent unless and until proven guilty.|$|E
