50|$|Myotonin-protein kinase is a serine-threonine kinase that {{is closely}} related to other kinases that {{interact}} with members of the Rho family of small GTPases. Substrates for this enzyme include myogenin, the beta-subunit of the L-type calcium channels, and phospholemman. Although the specific function of this protein is unknown, it appears {{to play an important role}} in muscle, heart, and brain cells. This protein may be involved in <b>communication</b> <b>within</b> <b>cells.</b> It also appears to regulate the production and function of important structures inside muscle cells by interacting with other proteins. For example, myotonic dystrophy protein kinase has been shown to turn off (inhibit) part of a muscle protein called myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase is an enzyme that plays a role in muscle tensing (contraction) and relaxation.|$|E

25|$|Another {{autonomous}} {{philosophy of}} biology {{is represented by}} Guenther Witzany and his theory of biocommunication: Living nature is structured and organized by language and <b>communication</b> <b>within</b> and among <b>cells,</b> tissues, organs and organisms. This means that besides human language and communication every living entity is competent to use signs with which it can differentiate between self and non-self. The communicative competence serves for coordination of group behavior (tissues, organs, organisms). Biocommunication research is applied to all organismic kingdoms based on empirical data. Additionally the biocommunication method investigates nucleotide sequences as natural code which is structured according combinatorial, context-sensitive and content-specific rules. Natural genome editing from a biocommunicative perspective consequently is investigated as competent agent-driven generation and integration of meaningful nucleotide sequences into pre-existing genomic content arrangements of host organisms. Such natural genome editing agents can (re)combine and (re)regulate host genome content according to context-dependent (i.e. adaptational) purposes. Such active agent-driven processes contradict passive error replication (mutation) narratives to explain emergence of genetic diversity.|$|R
40|$|Fungi are sessile, highly {{sensitive}} organisms that actively compete for environmental resources both {{above and below}} the ground. They assess their surroundings, estimate how much energy they need for particular goals, and then realise the optimum variant. They take measures to control certain environmental resources. They perceive themselves and can distinguish between ‘self’ and ‘non-self’. They process and evaluate information and then modify their behaviour accordingly. These highly diverse competences show us that this is possible owing to sign(aling) -mediated <b>communication</b> processes <b>within</b> fungal <b>cells</b> (intraorganismic), between the same, related and different fungal species (interorganismic), and between fungi and non-fungal organisms (transorganismic).

This is crucial in coordinating growth and development, shape and dynamics. Such communication must function both on the local level and between widely separated mycelium parts.

40|$|Our {{objective}} is to construct a Run-time System for Erasmus. Software systems nowadays are becoming very complex, so the last thing a programmer {{would want to do}} is to worry about the internal management of communication. We describe a system that provides Erasmus with a well-defined level of abstraction. This run-time system also provides processes with independence, which means that no two processes know each others' location. Erasmus is a process oriented concurrent programming language being developed by Peter Grogono at Concordia University and Brian Shearing at The Software Factory in England. Erasmus is based mainly on cells, processes, and their interactions through message passing. For every cell there will be a manager to initiate the communication and also to route the communication, whether it is local or remote. Programmers should only be deciding which kind of data they want to send and the rest will be taken care by the run-time system. For <b>communication</b> <b>within</b> a <b>cell,</b> channels with local communication methods will be used; for communication over the network or on different processors, a broker with remote communication methods will complete the communication link. There is also a separate protocol for a manager process to decide between local and remote communication. This thesis discusses in detail the issues related to process independence. It also explains how processes can be separated from the communication protocols. This run-time system will provide software of greater simplicity and fewer irrelevant details...|$|R

500|$|Inactive PKA {{holoenzyme}} {{exists as}} a tetramer {{composed of two}} regulatory (R) subunits and two catalytic (C) subunits. Biochemical studies demonstrated {{that there are two}} types of R subunits. The type I R subunits of which there are two isoforms (RIα, and RIβ) bind the catalytic subunits to create the type I PKA holoenzyme. Likewise type II R subunits, of which there are two isoforms (RIIα, and RIIβ), create the type II PKA holoenzyme. In the presence of cAMP, each R subunit binds 2 cAMP molecules and causes a conformational change in the R subunits that releases the C subunits to phosphorylate downstream substrates. The different R subunits differ in their sensitivity to cAMP, expression levels and subcellular locations. A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs) bind a surface formed between both R subunits and target the kinase to different locations in the cell.

40|$|To avoid signal {{interference}} in mobile communication {{it is necessary}} that the frequencies used for <b>communication</b> <b>within</b> each <b>cell</b> are allocated so that no signal interference occurs with neighbouring cells. We model this channel allocation problem as a generalised list colouring problem and we show how to analytically measure and provide worst-case guarantees regarding request satisfiability. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been done before and gives a now perspective to the problem, as well as a clear direction for further investigation. We propose distributed approaches for solving the problem, which are able to adapt fast to temporal variations in channel demands in different cells, as well as to cope with crash failures, by limiting the failure-locality - the size of the network that can be affected by a faulty station, in terms of the distance from that station. Our first approach is inspired by a relatively recent theorem relating graph colourings and orientations; it achieves the equivalent of the best known sequentially achievable upper bound for request satisfiability, implied by the theorem. It also employs a powerful synchronisation mechanism to achieve worst-case response time that depends only on A - the degree of the signal interference graph - and failure locality 4. Our second proposal is a first approach towards exploring what bound in request satisfiability is achievable without the use of extra synchronisation; by employing randomisation in frequency choices, in only one round of communication, a base station can expect to pick f/(4 Delta) frequencies, where f is the size of the list at the node; the failure locality of this solution is only 1...|$|R
40|$|Intercellular <b>communication</b> between <b>cells</b> <b>within</b> {{the blood}} vessel wall plays an {{important}} role in the control of artery diameter. The endothelial cells lining the lumen of arteries can evoke smooth muscle hyperpolarization both by the release of a factor (EDHF) and by direct cell-cell coupling through gap junctions. Hyperpolarizing current can spread rapidly to cause widespread vasodilatation, and thus increase blood flow to that segment. In addition to the spread of current, small molecules, such as Ca 2 +, can also pass between cells, but at a much reduced rate. Instead of co-ordinating changes in diameter, intercellular Ca 2 + signalling acts to amplify and, in special cases, modulate vascular responses. Together, direct cell-cell communication enables the blood vessel wall to act as a functional syncytium, which is influenced by surrounding tissues and nerves, and blood constituents...|$|R

To clarify changes in gap junctional intercel-lular communication during the early stages of neural differentiation,we established an in vitro system for neural induction from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and analyzed their capability of gap junctional intercellular communication by microinjection tracer coupling with neurobiotin. Undifferentiated ES cells were culturedirL SuSpenSion for 8 days and treated with all-trans retinoic acid(500 nM) during the latter half of tlle period. Thereafter,Cells were transferred to adhesion culture. Neurites were observed in more than 90 % of embryoid bodies at day 6 after the beginning of adhesion culture. Concerning neural markers, in small clusters at day 1 of adhesion culture cells were positive for A 2 B 5, which is known to be expressed from the neuroepithelial stage in vivo. Cells with neurites showed positive signals of microtuble-associated protein 2 (MAP 2) and neurofilament M subunit, markers for more differentiated neurons on and after day 3 of adhesion culture. Utilizing this in vitro neural-differentiation system from ES cells, We dispersed embryoid bodies by treatment with trypsin and developed a dispersed cell culture system for early neuronal cells. In this system,cells positive for neuronal markers formed small colonies after one day of culture. Neurobiotin microinjected into a single cell was found to spread into all cells constituting colonies that expressed A 2 B 5 at day 1 of adhesion culture after dispersion, but the dye did not spread into flat cells when there was no A 2 B 5 expression around the colony. On the other hand, after day 3 of adhesion culture after dispersion, neurobiotin injected into a single cell in the colony was restricted to small portions of the colony. Connlexin 26 was expressed in neural <b>cells</b> <b>within</b> the colony.

Such a signaling profile, routed through both phosphorylation and proteolytic cascades activated by inflammatory and oxidative stresses in highly penetrant familial monogenic forms of AD, could be informative for pathogenesis of the complex multigenic sporadic form of AD. Comparing stimulus-specific cascades of signal transduction revealed a striking diversity of molecular signaling profiles in AD human skin fibroblasts that express endogenous levels of mutant presenilins PS- 1 or PS- 2 or the Trisomy 21 proteome.

40|$|The myriad {{functions}} of lipids as signalling molecules {{is one of}} the most interesting fields in contemporary pharmacology, with a host of compounds recognized as mediators of <b>communication</b> <b>within</b> and between <b>cells.</b> The N-acyl conjugates of amino acids and neurotransmitters (NAANs) have recently come to prominence because of their potential roles in the nervous system, vasculature and the immune system. NAAN are compounds such as glycine, GABA or dopamine conjugated with long chain fatty acids. More than 70 endogenous NAAN have been reported although their physiological role remains uncertain, with various NAAN interacting with a low affinity at G protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and ion channels. Regardless of their potential physiological function, NAAN are of great interest to pharmacologists because of their potential as flexible tools to probe new sites on GPCRs, transporters and ion channels. NAANs are amphipathic molecules, with a wide variety of potential fatty acid and headgroup moieties, a combination which provides a rich source of potential ligands engaging novel binding sites and mechanisms for modulation of membrane proteins such as GPCRs, ion channels and transporters. The unique actions of subsets of NAAN on voltage-gated calcium channels and glycine transporters indicate that the wide variety of NAAN may provide a readily exploitable resource for defining new pharmacological targets. Investigation of the physiological roles and pharmacological potential of these simple lipid conjugates is in its infancy, and we believe that there is much to be learnt from their careful study. 15 page(s...|$|R

Here, we have examined two transgenic murine models probing the role of junctophilin- 2, a membrane-tethering protein crucial for the formation and molecular organisation of sub-microscopic junctions in ventricular muscle cells of the heart. Quantitative single-molecule localisation microscopy showed that junctions in animals producing above-normal levels of junctophilin- 2 were enlarged, allowing the re-organisation of the primary functional protein within it, the ryanodine receptor (RyR; in this paper, we use RyR {{to refer to the}} myocardial isoform RyR 2). Although this change was associated with much enlarged RyR clusters that, due to their size, should be more excitable, functionally it caused a mild inhibition in the Ca 2 + signalling output of the junctions (Ca 2 + sparks). Analysis of the single-molecule densities of both RyR and junctophilin- 2 revealed an ∼ 3 -fold increase in the junctophilin- 2 to RyR ratio.
