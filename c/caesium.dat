5|$|<b>Caesium</b> {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, but most <b>caesium</b> compounds are mildly toxic. Like rubidium, <b>caesium</b> tends to substitute potassium in the body, but is significantly larger {{and is therefore}} a poorer substitute. Excess <b>caesium</b> can lead to hypokalemia, arrythmia, and acute cardiac arrest, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources. As such, <b>caesium</b> {{is not a major}} chemical environmental pollutant. The median lethal dose (LD50) value for <b>caesium</b> chloride in mice is 2.3g per kilogram, which is comparable to the LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride. <b>Caesium</b> chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy, but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.|$|E
5|$|For {{several years}} in the 1950s and 1960s, a {{by-product}} of the potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium while the rest was potassium and {{a small fraction of}} <b>caesium.</b> Today the largest producers of <b>caesium,</b> for example the Tanco Mine in Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as by-product from pollucite. Today, a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and <b>caesium</b> is the fractional crystallisation of a rubidium and <b>caesium</b> alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O, which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately 30 recrystallisations. The limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limit the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. <b>Caesium,</b> however, is not produced from the above reaction. Instead, the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure <b>caesium,</b> extracted from the ore mainly by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction. Both metals are produced as by-products of lithium production: after 1958, when interest in lithium's thermonuclear properties increased sharply, the production of rubidium and <b>caesium</b> also increased correspondingly. Pure rubidium and <b>caesium</b> metals are produced by reducing their chlorides with calcium metal at 750°C and low pressure.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium and <b>caesium</b> {{are often}} used in atomic clocks. <b>Caesium</b> atomic clocks are {{extraordinarily}} accurate; if a clock had been made {{at the time of}} the dinosaurs, it would be off by less than four seconds (after 80 million years). For that reason, <b>caesium</b> atoms are used as the definition of the second. Rubidium ions {{are often used}} in purple fireworks, and <b>caesium</b> is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rubidium}} is {{more abundant}} in Earth's crust than <b>caesium,</b> the limited applications {{and the lack}} of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Several methods are available for separating potassium, rubidium, and <b>caesium.</b> The fractional crystallization of a rubidium and <b>caesium</b> alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum. Two other methods are reported, the chlorostannate process and the ferrocyanide process.|$|E
5|$|<b>Caesium</b> {{fluoride}} is also {{a popular}} source of fluoride in organofluorine chemistry. For example, CsF reacts with hexafluoroacetone to form a <b>caesium</b> perfluoroalkoxide salt, which is stable up to 60°C, unlike the corresponding sodium or potassium salt. It will convert electron-deficient aryl chlorides to aryl fluorides (halex reaction).|$|E
5|$|<b>Caesium</b> {{fluoride}} or cesium fluoride is an {{inorganic compound}} usually encountered as a hygroscopic white solid. It {{is used in}} organic synthesis {{as a source of}} the fluoride anion. <b>Caesium</b> has the highest electropositivity of all non-radioactive elements and fluorine has the highest electronegativity of all elements.|$|E
5|$|Francium coprecipitates {{with several}} <b>caesium</b> salts, such as <b>caesium</b> perchlorate, {{which results in}} small amounts of {{francium}} perchlorate. This coprecipitation {{can be used to}} isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and Nelson. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other <b>caesium</b> salts, including the iodate, the picrate, the tartrate (also rubidium tartrate), the chloroplatinate, and the silicotungstate. It also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid, and with perchloric acid, without another alkali metal as a carrier, which provides other methods of separation. Nearly all francium salts are water-soluble.|$|E
5|$|Like other soluble fluorides, CsF is {{moderately}} toxic. Contact with acid {{should be}} avoided, as this forms highly toxic/corrosive hydrofluoric acid. The <b>caesium</b> ion (Cs+) and <b>caesium</b> chloride {{are generally not}} considered toxic.|$|E
5|$|Linus Pauling {{estimated}} the electronegativity of francium at 0.7 on the Pauling scale, {{the same as}} caesium; the value for <b>caesium</b> has since been refined to 0.79, {{but there are no}} experimental data to allow a refinement of the value for francium. Francium has a slightly higher ionization energy than <b>caesium,</b> 392.811(4)kJ/mol as opposed to 375.7041(2)kJ/mol for <b>caesium,</b> as would be expected from relativistic effects, and this would imply that <b>caesium</b> is the less electronegative of the two. Francium should also have a higher electron affinity than <b>caesium</b> and the Fr− ion should be more polarizable than the Cs− ion. The CsFr molecule is predicted to have francium at the negative end of the dipole, unlike all known heterodiatomic alkali metal molecules. Francium superoxide (FrO2) is expected to have a more covalent character than its lighter congeners; this is attributed to the 6p electrons in francium being more involved in the francium–oxygen bonding.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium and <b>caesium</b> {{were the}} first {{elements}} to be discovered using the spectroscope, invented in 1859 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff. The next year, they discovered <b>caesium</b> in the mineral water from Bad Dürkheim, Germany. Their discovery of rubidium came the following year in Heidelberg, Germany, finding it in the mineral lepidolite. The names of rubidium and <b>caesium</b> come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra: a bright red line for rubidium (from the Latin word rubidus, meaning dark red or bright red), and a sky-blue line for <b>caesium</b> (derived from the Latin word caesius, meaning sky-blue).|$|E
5|$|All of the {{alkali metals}} except lithium and <b>caesium</b> {{have at least}} one {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope: sodium-22 and sodium-24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically, potassium-40 and rubidium-87 have very long half-lives and thus occur naturally, and all isotopes of francium are radioactive. <b>Caesium</b> was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century, although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes. (Francium had not been discovered yet at that time.) The natural long-lived radioisotope of potassium, potassium-40, makes up about 0.012% of natural potassium, and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive. This natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 (the next alkali metal after <b>caesium)</b> in 1925. Natural rubidium is similarly slightly radioactive, with 27.83% being the long-lived radioisotope rubidium-87.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} similar atomic radii, {{rubidium}} and <b>caesium</b> {{in the body}} mimic potassium and are taken up similarly. Rubidium has no known biological role, but may help stimulate metabolism, and, similarly to <b>caesium,</b> replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency. Partial substitution is quite possible and rather non-toxic: a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, {{and an increase in}} this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. Rats can survive up to 50% substitution of potassium by rubidium. Rubidium (and to a much lesser extent <b>caesium)</b> can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia; while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems, <b>caesium</b> is never able to do so. There is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in goats; even if this is true, the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough.|$|E
5|$|For {{several years}} in the 1950s and 1960s, a {{by-product}} of potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium, with the rest being potassium and {{a small amount of}} <b>caesium.</b> Today the largest producers of <b>caesium,</b> such as the Tanco Mine, Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as a by-product from pollucite.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium and <b>caesium</b> {{can form}} {{a great variety}} of suboxides with the metals in formal {{oxidation}} states below +1. Rubidium can form Rb6O and Rb9O2 (copper-coloured) upon oxidation in air, while <b>caesium</b> forms an immense variety of oxides, such as the ozonide CsO3 and several brightly coloured suboxides, such as Cs7O (bronze), Cs4O (red-violet), Cs11O3 (violet), Cs3O (dark green), CsO, Cs3O2, as well as Cs7O2. The last of these may be heated under vacuum to generate Cs2O.|$|E
5|$|The first {{accurate}} atomic clock, a <b>caesium</b> standard {{based on}} a certain transition of the caesium-133 atom, was built by Louis Essen in 1955 at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK. Calibration of the <b>caesium</b> standard atomic clock {{was carried out by}} the use of the astronomical time scale ephemeris time (ET).|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is {{also used}} in aluminium-silicon cast alloys in order to refine silicon morphology. However, it {{indicated}} a poisoning effect on modification of strontium (Sr). Some bismuth alloys, such as Bi35-Pb37-Sn25, are combined with non-sticking materials such as mica, glass and enamels because they easily wet them allowing to make joints to other parts. Addition of bismuth to <b>caesium</b> enhances the quantum yield of <b>caesium</b> cathodes. Sintering of bismuth and manganese powders at 300°C produces a permanent magnet and magnetostrictive material, which is used in ultrasonic generators and receivers working in the 10–100kHz range and in magnetic memory devices.|$|E
5|$|<b>Caesium</b> {{fluoride}} has the halite structure, {{which means}} that the Cs+ and F pack in a cubic closest packed array as do Na+ and Cl in sodium chloride.|$|E
5|$|Francium is also {{predicted}} {{to show some}} differences due to its high atomic weight, causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions {{of the speed of}} light and thus making relativistic effects more prominent. In contrast to the trend of decreasing electronegativities and ionisation energies of the alkali metals, francium's electronegativity and ionisation energy are {{predicted to}} be higher than caesium's due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons; also, its atomic radius is expected to be abnormally low. Thus, contrary to expectation, <b>caesium</b> is the most reactive of the alkali metals, not francium. All known physical properties of francium also deviate from the clear trends going from lithium to <b>caesium,</b> such as the first ionisation energy, electron affinity, and anion polarisability, though due to the paucity of known data about francium many sources give extrapolated values, ignoring that relativistic effects make the trend from lithium to <b>caesium</b> become inapplicable at francium. Some of the few properties of francium that have been predicted taking relativity into account are the electron affinity (47.2 kJ/mol) and the enthalpy of dissociation of the Fr2 molecule (42.1 kJ/mol). The CsFr molecule is polarised as Cs+Fr−, showing that the 7s subshell of francium is much more strongly affected by relativistic effects than the 6s subshell of <b>caesium.</b> Additionally, francium superoxide (FrO2) is expected to have significant covalent character, unlike the other alkali metal superoxides, because of bonding contributions from the 6p electrons of francium.|$|E
5|$|Most {{alkali metals}} have many {{different}} applications. One {{of the best-known}} applications of the pure elements {{is the use of}} rubidium and <b>caesium</b> in atomic clocks, of which <b>caesium</b> atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time. A common application of the compounds of sodium is the sodium-vapour lamp, which emits light very efficiently. Table salt, or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity. Sodium and potassium are also essential elements, having major biological roles as electrolytes, and although the other alkali metals are not essential, they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.|$|E
5|$|Seawater {{contains}} {{an average of}} 125µg/L of rubidium compared to the much higher value for potassium of 408mg/L and the much lower value of 0.3µg/L for <b>caesium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{francium}} is {{the heaviest}} alkali metal {{that has been}} discovered, {{there has been some}} theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals. Being the first period 8 element, the undiscovered element ununennium (element 119) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties. Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of <b>caesium</b> or francium. This is unusual as periodic trends, ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than <b>caesium</b> and francium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for francium. This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects. The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's electron affinity far beyond that of <b>caesium</b> and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium. On the other hand, ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group, being expected to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1870, chemists {{thought that there}} should be an alkali metal beyond <b>caesium,</b> with an atomic number of 87. It was then {{referred}} to by the provisional name eka-caesium. Research teams attempted to locate and isolate this missing element, and at least four false claims were made that the element had been found before an authentic discovery was made.|$|E
5|$|Francium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolFr and atomic number87. It {{used to be}} known as eka-caesium and actinium K. It is the second-least electronegative element, behind only <b>caesium,</b> and is the second rarest naturally occurring element (after astatine). Francium is a highly radioactive metal that decays into astatine, radium, and radon. As an alkali metal, it has one valence electron.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} T.felleus {{have a high}} {{capacity}} to accumulate radioactive <b>caesium</b> (137Cs) from contaminated soil, a characteristic attributed to the deep soil penetration achieved by the mycelium. In contrast, the species has a limited capacity to accumulate the radioactive isotope 210Po.|$|E
5|$|It is {{expected}} that {{the definition of the}} kilogram and several other units will change on May 20, 2019, following a final vote by the CGPM in November 2018. The new definition will use only invariant quantities of nature: the Planck constant, the speed of light, and the <b>caesium</b> hyperfine frequency.|$|E
5|$|Layers of {{amorphous}} {{boron nitride}} (a-BN) {{are used in}} some semiconductor devices, e.g. MISFETs. They can be prepared by chemical decomposition of trichloroborazine with <b>caesium,</b> or by thermal chemical vapor deposition methods. Thermal CVD can be also used for deposition of h-BN layers, or at high temperatures, c-BN.|$|E
5|$|Radioisotopes of <b>caesium</b> {{require special}} precautions: the {{improper}} handling of caesium-137 gamma ray sources {{can lead to}} release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries. Perhaps the best-known case is the Goiânia accident of 1987, in which an improperly-disposed-of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic {{in the city of}} Goiânia, Brazil, was scavenged from a junkyard, and the glowing <b>caesium</b> salt sold to curious, uneducated buyers. This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure. Together with caesium-134, iodine-131, and strontium-90, caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by the Chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health. Radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short half-life, but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium is {{approximately}} as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and lepidolite, {{although none of}} these contain only rubidium and no other alkali metals. <b>Caesium</b> is more abundant than some commonly known elements, such as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but is much less abundant than rubidium.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{content in}} bulk may be {{determined}} by treating with a large excess of uranyl zinc acetate; the hexahydrate (UO2)2ZnNa(CH3CO2)·6H2O precipitates and can be weighed. <b>Caesium</b> and rubidium do not interfere with this reaction, but potassium and lithium do. Lower concentrations of sodium may {{be determined by}} atomic absorption spectrophotometry or by potentiometry using ion-selective electrodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{compressibility}} of an ionic compound {{is strongly}} determined by its structure, {{and in particular}} the coordination number. For example, halides with the <b>caesium</b> chloride structure (coordination number 8) are less compressible than those with the sodium chloride structure (coordination number 6), and less again than those with a coordination number of 4.|$|E
5|$|The stable {{alkali metals}} are all silver-{{coloured}} metals except for <b>caesium,</b> {{which has a}} pale golden tint: {{it is one of}} only three metals that are clearly coloured (the other two being copper and gold). Additionally, the heavy alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, and barium, as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, are pale yellow, though the colour is much less prominent than it is for <b>caesium.</b> Their lustre tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation. They all crystallise in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. Indeed, these flame test colours are the most common way of identifying them since all their salts with common ions are soluble.|$|E
5|$|The ternary berkelium(IV) {{chloride}} Cs2BkCl6 {{is obtained}} by dissolving berkelium(IV) hydroxide in a chilled solution of <b>caesium</b> chloride in concentrated hydrochloric acid. It forms orange hexagonal crystals with the lattice constants a = 745.1 pm and c = 1209.7 pm. The average {{radius of the}} BkCl62− ion in this compound is estimated as 270 pm.|$|E
5|$|Two notable {{sources of}} {{rubidium}} are the rich deposits of pollucite at Bernic Lake, Manitoba, Canada, and the rubicline ((Rb,K)AlSi3O8) found as impurities in pollucite on the Italian island of Elba, with a rubidium content of 17.5%. Both of those deposits are also sources of <b>caesium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Visible light waves {{oscillate}} {{faster than}} microwaves, and therefore optical clocks {{can be more}} precise than <b>caesium</b> atomic clocks. The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt is working on several such optical clocks. The model with one single ytterbium ion caught in an ion trap is highly accurate. The optical clock based on it is exact to 17 digits after the decimal point.|$|E
5|$|Francium is an {{alkali metal}} whose {{chemical}} properties mostly {{resemble those of}} <b>caesium.</b> A heavy element with a single valence electron, it has the highest equivalent weight of any element. Liquid francium—if created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092N/m at its melting point. Francium's melting point was calculated to be around 27°C (80°F, 300K). The melting point is uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity. Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677°C (1250°F, 950K) is also uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Most ALF vapor cells use {{alkali metals}} {{because of their}} high vapor pressures; many alkali metals also have {{absorption}} lines and resonance in the desired spectra. Common vapor cell materials are sodium, potassium and <b>caesium.</b> Note that non-metallic vapors such as neon may be used. As the early quantum counters used solid state metal ions in crystals, {{it is conceivable that}} such a medium could be used in the ALFs of today. This is presumably not done because of the superiority of atomic vapors in this capacity.|$|E
