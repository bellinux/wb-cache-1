25|$|In the {{basement}} of the floor of the Rene Block Gallery in Berlin, Beuys positioned himself on the floor wrapped in a large felt blanket. Emerging from either end of the blanket were two dead hares, often seen in his performances. Around him was an installation of <b>copper</b> <b>rod,</b> felt and fat. Inside a blanket he held a microphone and for a period of eight hours grunted into the microphone as viewers watched from the doorway. The grunts are compared to those of a stag, as the stag is a symbol of something like a chief. The performance directly relates and even includes elements of the Fluxus movement that Beuys was a part of. The grunting is seen in part of a composition as a reflection of suffering. Being wrapped in a felt blanket mirrors the story of his suffering and rescue by the Tartars after his plane crashed in the war.|$|E

40|$|The microstructure, microhardness, {{texture and}} {{corrosion}} resistance of cold-swaged and cold-wiredrawn <b>copper</b> <b>rods</b> were evaluated. Elongated grains along the deformation direction were observed for both {{materials and the}} width of these grains decreased {{with the increase of}} reduction in area. Wiredrawn <b>copper</b> <b>rods</b> have higher microhardness than the swaged rods for the same reduction in area. The copper grains in both cold-worked rods presented a preferential orientation in the [1 1 0] crystallographic direction but this trend was more pronounced for swaged rods. The corrosion resistance of wiredrawn <b>copper</b> <b>rods</b> investigated in H(2) SO(4) solutions was lower than that of swaged rods, and for both deformed materials the corrosion resistance decreased with the deformation degree.

500|$|The {{aluminum}} apex, at {{the time}} a rare metal as valuable as silver, was cast by William Frishmuth of Philadelphia. At the time of casting, it was the largest piece of aluminum in the world. Before the installation it was put on public display at Tiffany's in New York City and stepped over by visitors who could say they had [...] "stepped {{over the top of the}} Washington Monument". It was [...] tall before [...] was removed from its tip by lightning strikes during 1885–1934, when it was protected from further damage by tall lightning rods surrounding it. Its base is [...] square. The angle between opposite sides at its tip is 34°48'. It weighed [...] before lightning strikes removed a small amount of aluminum from its tip and sides. Spectral analysis in 1934 showed that it was composed of 97.87% aluminum with the rest impurities. It has a shallow depression in its base to match a slightly raised area atop the small upper surface of the marble capstone, which aligns the sides of the apex with those of the capstone, and the downward protruding lip around that area prevents water from entering the joint. It has a large hole in the center of its base to receive a threaded [...] diameter <b>copper</b> <b>rod</b> which attaches it to the monument and used to form part of the lightning protection system.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study in vivo the {{enhanced}} granulopoiesis that occurs during acute inflammation, 1 - 3 sterile metallic <b>copper</b> <b>rods</b> were inserted subcutaneously into mice either {{at the same place}} (one abscess) or at different sites (multiple abscesses). Diffusion chambers filled with bone marrow cells were implanted intraperitoneally for 3 days. When a single abscess was created, the granulocytic content of the diffusion chamber increased similarly whatever the number of inserted <b>copper</b> <b>rods.</b> However, there was a direct relationship between the number of abscesses and the number of granulocytic cells harvested from the diffusion chambers. In order to investigate the role of T-lymphocytes in the production of diffusible stimulating factors that act on diffusion chamber granulopoiesis, cyclosporin A (CyA) was given to the mice with implanted <b>copper</b> <b>rods.</b> CyA abrogated the induced enhancement of CFU-S, CFU-GM and mature granulocyte numbers inside the diffusion chamber. The stimulatory effect of inflammation on diffusion chamber granulopoiesis was not observed in T-lymphocyte-deficient nude mice. These data suggest that in vivo stimulation of granulopoiesis is related to the level of inflammation, and that this effect requires the functional integrity of T-lymphocytes...|$|R

A {{cylinder}} magnet, seven {{inches in}} length, and {{three quarters of}} an inch in diameter, had a hole pierced {{in the direction of}} its axis from one extremity, a quarter of an inch in diameter, and three inches deep. A copper cylinder, surrounded by paper and amalgamated at both extremities, was introduced so as to be in metallic contact {{at the bottom of the}} hole, by a little mercury, with the middle of the magnet; insulated at the sides by the paper; and projecting about a quarter of an inch above the end of the steel. A quill was put over the <b>copper</b> <b>rod,</b> which reached to the paper, and formed a cup to receive mercury for the completion of the circuit. A high paper edge was also raised round that end of the magnet and mercury put within it, which however had no metallic connexion with that in the quill, except through the magnet itself and the <b>copper</b> <b>rod</b> (fig. 34.). The wires A and B from the galvanometer were dipped into these two portions of mercury; any current through them could, therefore, only pass down the magnet towards its equatorial parts, and then up the copper rod; or vice versa.|$|E

50|$|Copper plating is {{the process}} of {{electrolytically}} forming a layer of copper on the surface of an item. It takes place in an electrolytic cell where electrolysis which uses direct electric current to dissolve a <b>copper</b> <b>rod</b> and transport the copper ions to the item. Into a container of water are placed a <b>copper</b> <b>rod,</b> and the item. The water contains an ionic solution which allows a direct electric current to flow from the <b>copper</b> <b>rod</b> to the item. The <b>copper</b> <b>rod</b> is the anode and the item is the cathode. This current flow causes the copper to ionize, become oxidized which means each atom becomes positively charged by losing an electrons. As the copper ions dissolve into the water, they form a coordination complex with salts already present. The copper then physically flows to the item, where it is reduced to the metallic state by gaining electrons. This forms a thin, solid, metallic copper film {{on the surface of the}} item.|$|E
