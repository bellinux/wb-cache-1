50|$|Geraniaceae is {{a family}} of {{flowering}} plants placed in the order Geraniales. The family name {{is derived from the}} genus Geranium. The family includes both the genus Geranium (the <b>cranesbills,</b> or true geraniums) and the garden plants called geraniums, which modern botany classifies as genus Pelargonium, along with other related genera.|$|R
2500|$|Pelargonium [...] is a genus of {{flowering}} plants which includes about 200 species of perennials, succulents, and shrubs, {{commonly known as}} geraniums (in the United States also storksbills). Confusingly, Geranium is the botanical name (and also common name) of a separate genus of related plants often called <b>cranesbills.</b> Both genera belong to the family Geraniaceae. Linnaeus originally included all the species in one genus, Geranium, and they were later separated into two genera by Charles L’Héritier in 1789.|$|R

The {{remaining}} {{groups are}} in great part natural; but I separate for subsequent study five orders of supreme domestic utility, the Mallows, Currants, Pease,[58] Cresses, and <b>Cranesbills,</b> from those which, either in fruit or blossom, are for finer pleasure or higher beauty. I {{think it will}} be generally interesting for children to learn those five names as an easy lesson, and gradually discover, wondering, the world that they include. I will give their terminology at length, separately.|$|R
25|$|The {{mother of}} the late Mrs. Minnie Hastings of West Lambroughton Farm {{had been one of}} the last {{occupants}} of the house at the Crevoch Mill site. The family name was Kerr. A track led from Crivoch up to Bottoms farm and this gave access through to Chapeltoun. The full name of Bottoms farm is Bottoms at Point Crivoch. The dusky <b>cranesbill,</b> a rare garden escape, was recorded by the Glenfield Ramblers' at Crivoch mill in the 1850s and was still growing at the site in 2004.|$|E
500|$|The old {{mill pond}} above the hamlet has been {{restored}} by the Northumberland National Park Authority. [...] Blackbirds, wrens and thrushes are often seen in the hedge banks along the lane to Longknowe, and the roadside verges contain a colourful variety of flowering plants, including dog roses, St John's wort, stitchwort and bloody <b>cranesbill.</b> [...] Nearby is a sheepwash, where Kilham's shepherds increased {{the value of the}} fleeces by washing their sheep's wool before it was clipped.|$|E

50|$|Flora is {{represented}} in Buzău by {{the remainder of the}} Codrii Vlăsiei in the west, a 189 hectares oak forest. Crâng Park occupies 10 hectares of this forest. Most streets in Buzău have trees planted alongside them, such as chestnuts on the Nicolae Bălcescu Boulevard and lime trees on the Unirii Boulevard. Flowers grown by the local people in the yard typically include various species of roses, hyacinths, tulips, peonies, <b>cranesbills</b> and petunias, as well as vine and ivy for shade.|$|R
50|$|Geranium is a genus of 422 {{species of}} {{flowering}} annual, biennial, and perennial {{plants that are}} commonly known as the <b>cranesbills.</b> They are found throughout the temperate regions {{of the world and the}} mountains of the tropics, but mostly in the eastern part of the Mediterranean region. The long, palmately cleft leaves are broadly circular in form. The flowers have five petals and are coloured white, pink, purple or blue, often with distinctive veining. Geraniums will grow in any soil as long as it is not waterlogged. Propagation is by semiripe cuttings in summer, by seed, or by division in autumn or spring.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the valleys}} {{and on the}} mountainside, in contrast, the diabase and the better weather permit a richer vegetation. In particular, these areas are {{blanketed}} in forest, with the plant species varying with altitude: moor birch, Scots pine and Norway spruce cover , [...] and , respectively. The undergrowth also presents great diversity in plant life. To wit, the south-facing slopes are principally covered in Scots pines and their undergrowth strongly resembles heath, with in particular common heather and crowberry. The rest of the coniferous forests include most often whortleberry, northern oak fern, woundwort, and common cow-wheat. The soil rich in diabase allows the growth of more demanding plants, such as Alpine blue-sow-thistle, wood <b>cranesbill</b> [...] and northern wolfsbane. These zones also have {{a great number of}} species of moss; the park has {{more than a third of}} all the species of moss in the country.|$|E

60|$|We wandered about picking {{flowers and}} talking until teatime. A manservant {{came with the}} tea-basket, and the girls spread the cloth under a great willow tree. Lettie took the little silver kettle, and went to fill it at the small spring which trickled into a stone trough all pretty with <b>cranesbill</b> and stellaria hanging over, while long blades of grass waved in the water. George, who had {{finished}} his work, and {{wanted to go home}} to tea, walked across to the spring where Lettie sat playing with the water, getting little cupfuls to put into the kettle, watching the quick skating of the water beetles, and the large faint spots of their shadows darting on the silted mud {{at the bottom of the}} trough.|$|E

5000|$|Geranium bicknellii is {{a species}} of {{geranium}} known by the common names Bicknell's <b>cranesbill</b> and northern <b>cranesbill.</b> It is native {{to much of the}} northern half of North America, where it {{can be found in a}} number of forest and woodland habitats. This is an annual or biennial herb which grows hairy stems up to about half a meter long. It may be erect or lie near the ground. Each leaf is several centimeters long and wide and is divided into several lobes, each of which may have smaller lobes or teeth. Flowers grow singly or in pairs and have pointed sepals and small lavender petals, each with a notch in the tip. The fruit has a rounded body with a long, straight style about 2 centimeters in length and tipped with a small beak.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife {{includes}} an important population of Black Grouse, {{along with the}} more usual upland birds. Sea-trout and salmon run the River Wear while adders (snakes) are sometimes encountered on the moors. With regard to flora, some species-rich meadows remain, and the wood <b>cranesbill</b> (Geranium sylvaticum) and meadow <b>cranesbill</b> (G. pratense) are easy to spot in summer while the mountain pansy (Viola lutea) is a characteristic plant of the shorter grass round the upper dale. Around the upper dale also, in late Spring, damp places are bright with yellow marsh marigolds, of a variety (Caltha palustris minor) that is rather smaller than the ordinary marsh marigold (Caltha palustris). The tiny but beautiful spring sandwort (Minuartia verna) may be seen around old lead workings, enabled by its high tolerance of lead to colonise ground where contamination inhibits other species.|$|E
