2500|$|The Tweedie {{convergence}} theorem {{provides a}} hypothetical {{explanation for the}} wide manifestation of fluctuation scaling and 1/f noise.

[...] Almost all distribution functions with finite <b>cumulant</b> generating functions qualify as exponential dispersion models and most exponential dispersion models manifest variance functions of this form. [...] Hence many probability distributions have variance functions that express this asymptotic behavior, and [...] the Tweedie distributions become foci of convergence {{for a wide range}} of data types.|$|E
