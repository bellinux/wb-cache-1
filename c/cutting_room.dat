5|$|Martin Varno's {{dissatisfaction with}} the Cormans {{eventually}} led him to take them into formal arbitration proceedings. Although Varno was {{not a member of}} the Writers Guild of America when he wrote the Blood Beast script, he was encouraged by actor Jay Jostyn to discuss the matter with them. According to Varno, Jostyn claimed several actors and writers had similar problems with the Cormans in the past, but were not taking action because the Cormans provided them continued work in their films. After meeting with the Writers Guild, Varno became a member and filed arbitration papers against the Cormans for not paying him enough. Roger Corman was in the process of editing the film when he received the arbitration notice, and he became so angry he started screaming and throwing things in the <b>cutting</b> <b>room.</b> Varno claims one of the film crew members approached him (Varno) and promised that the Cormans would hire Varno to work on many of their future films if he dropped the matter, but Varno refused.|$|E

[...] Of Fields' work at Universal, Joel Schumacher was quoted in 1982 as saying: [...] "In the record business, you have Berry Gordy and Ahmet Ertegün.
