40|$|The {{manifesto}} of {{ubiquitous computing}} is traditionally {{considered to be}} the justly famous 1991 visionary article written for Scientific American by the late Mark Weiser of Xerox PARC (Weiser, 1991). But the true birth date of this revolution, perhaps hard to pinpoint precisely, precedes that publication by at least a few years: Weiser himself first spoke of “ubiquitous computing ” around 1988 and other researchers around the world had also been focusing their efforts in that direction during the late Eighties. Indeed, one of the images in Weiser’s article depicts an Active Badge, an infrared-emitting tag worn by research scientists to locate their colleagues when they were not in their office (in the days before mobile phones were commonplace) and to enable audio and video phone <b>call</b> <b>rerouting</b> and other follow-me applications. That device was initially developed by Roy Want and Andy Hopper (Want, Hopper, Falcao, and Gibbons, 1992) at Olivetti Research Limited (ORL) in 1989. Soon afterwards other research institutions, including Xerox PARC themselves who later hired Want, acquired Active Badge installations and started to explore the wide horizons opened by the novel idea of letting your spatial position be an input that implicitly told the computer system what to do. I was fortunate enough to work at ORL as a research scientist throughout the Nineties, thereby acquiring first hand experience of these and other pioneering developments in ubiquitous computing 2. Looking back and putting things into historical perspective, ubiquitous computing really was a revolution, one of these major events in computing that take place onc...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{broadband}} integrated service digital networks (B-ISDN) must handle multiclass traffic {{with diverse}} {{quality of service}} (QOS) requirements. The main purpose of our research is to design <b>call</b> <b>rerouting</b> mechanisms which provide rapid restoration of network services in case of link failures. We suggest two approaches: Virtual circuit (VC) and virtual path (VP) reroutings. The first approach is more reactive while the latter is more proactive. The applicability conditions for the first approach include {{the availability of a}} layered network structure similar to VC/VP architecture which is widely accepted in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks. Another applicability condition is the extent of network failure: VP level restoration is designed for single link failures - the most common in the telecommunication networks. On the other hand, in case of less predictable multiple link failures, VC-level rerouting is appropriate. These two rerouting approaches vary in the amount of time required to carry them out. Though both schemes are designed to work in real time, VP-level rerouting tends to be faster and can be performed in an on-line mode using pre-computed paths. VC- level rerouting requires real-time computation of routes which may result in a noticeable impact on some services. On the other hand, VP-level rerouting requires a substantial amount of off- line computation to design the VP layout and the backup routes. In this dissertation we propose a new model and associated algorithms to solve a VC-rerouting problem in real time. This model takes advantage of the distributed network data and computational resources by decomposing the problem at an early stage and then performing the computations in a decentralized mode. In order to solve the fault tolerant VP layout problem, we formulate a bi-criteria optimization model reflecting the tradeoff between throughput and certain QOS requirements. The model involves a piece-wise linear approximation to the capacity allocation rule for variable bit rate connections statistically multiplexed over a VP. Both models are formulated as integer programs. The solution method developed employ relaxation and aggregation of variables, feasible solution heuristics and valid inequalities. The results of the computational experiments presented indicate that the methods developed are efficient and produce accurate solutions...|$|E

40|$|A new handoff {{management}} scheme for wireless ATM networks is proposed. In this scheme, all cells {{are connected to}} their neighboring cells by permanent virtual circuits (PVCs) and to the access switch (AS) by switched virtual circuits (SVCs) which are only for new calls. Some carefully chosen cells, <b>called</b> <b>rerouting</b> cells, are also connected to the AS by PVCs. In summary, if a mobile roams to an ordinary neighboring cell, its traffic path is simply elongated by a PVC connecting {{the old and new}} cells. If a mobile roams to a rerouting cell, its traffic path is rerouted to a PVC between the AS and rerouting cell. By using PVC's for handoff calls, we can guarantee fast and seamless handoff. At the same time, our scheme improves the path efficiency by limiting the maximum number of hops that a path can be extended. Also, allowing path rerouting at a suitable time means the network resources are more efficiently utilized. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|In large networks, {{maintaining}} precise {{global network}} state information is impossible. The imprecise network state information has significant impacts on Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing and path establishment. In this paper, we develop analytical models for investigating the QoS routing schemes {{that are designed}} to tolerate imprecise network state information, and study the performance of various QoS routing schemes, including randomized routing, multi-path routing, and probability based routing, using both the models and simulations. We further propose a new mechanism, <b>called</b> local <b>rerouting,</b> that improves the effectiveness of QoS path establishment in the presence of imprecise global network state information. Local rerouting is orthogonal to existing schemes for dealing with imprecise state information and can be used in conjunction with them to alleviate the impacts of the imprecise information.

Finally, a polynomial time algorithm for counting the number of isolated paths is given.

Call-back firms exploit arbitrage opportunities in collection prices among countries, <b>rerouteing</b> <b>calls</b> that originate in countries with high prices for international phone calls via countries with low prices. Contrary {{to what it is}} commonly perceived, we show that call-back tends to magnify the distortions associated with the current accounting rate regime. In particular call-back puts upward pressure both on low price countries foreign accounting rates and collection charges. Call-back companies are assumed to enjoy a price discount on each rerouted call; we show that the larger the price discount offered to call-back companies, the higher the prices for international calls in the country hosting call-back. telecommunications; call-back; access; accounting rate; collection charge; international telephony. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Quickly {{recovering}} IP networks from failures {{is critical}} to enhancing Internet robustness and availability. Due to their serious impact on network routing, large-scale failures have received increasing attention in recent years. We propose an approach <b>called</b> Reactive Two-phase <b>Rerouting</b> (RTR) for intra-domain routing to quickly recover from largescale failures with the shortest recovery paths. To recover a failed routing path, RTR first forwards packets around the failure area to collect information on failures. Then, in the second phase, RTR calculates a new shortest path and forwards packets along it through source routing. RTR can deal with large-scale failures associated with areas of any shape and location, and is free of permanent loops. For any failure area, the recovery paths provided by RTR are guaranteed to be the shortest. Extensive simulations based on ISP topologies show that RTR can find the shortest recovery paths for more than 98. 6 % of failed routing paths with reachable destinations. Compared with prior works, RTR achieves better performance for recoverable failed routing paths and uses much less network resources for irrecoverable failed routing paths. I...|$|R
50|$|Quality {{is usually}} {{measured}} by the Answer-Seizure Ratio (ASR = call attempts answered / call attempts), Post-Dial Delay (PDD) and the Average Call Duration (ACD). If the average call duration is very low, it is taken to mean that the call quality is so poor that people cannot have a conversation and hang up. This matters to calling card operators because people do not re-purchase card services that give a low ACD. In case of significant discrepancies in ACD values across available routes, the carrier shall prioritize the routes offering higher ACD. A low ASR is taken to mean that callers cannot get through {{to the other end}} and hence that the route is congested or is of low quality. The low ASR is not as bad as low ACD, because it suggests at least a proper answer supervision (i.e. correct signaling), and therefore the handover mechanism can <b>reroute</b> <b>calls</b> via other available routes. An on-line monitoring system of a quality based routing is publicly available for a demo traffic. Post-dial delay is the time from dialing the last digit to the time a caller hears ringing.|$|R

40|$|Grids today {{generally}} {{assume that}} concurrent network connections are possible among many processors attached to high-capacity networks. However, inter-network boundaries dividing independent institutions often have firewalls, typically to restrict how many and which ports are accessible. In some cases, ports are opened indefinitely for Grid applications, but this compromises security significantly. On the other hand, solutions that manage port openings in an ad-hoc manner for applications are non-trivial to implement. An alternative firewall traversal technique is required {{that will provide}} manageable openings with less complexity involved. This is possible through proxies and managed tunnels using ports already authorized across the firewalls.

However, a single tunnel presents a performance bottleneck. In this paper, we present the method by which Remus distributes several connections over multiple tunnels, improving throughput as a result. Rerouting wrappers hide the tunneling from applications, intercepting outgoing connections and rerouting them transparently. Wellknown and mature tools and protocols, such as SSH and/or SOCKS, are utilized, instead of imposing customized, non-standard mechanisms.
