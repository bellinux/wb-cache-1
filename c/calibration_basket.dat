40|$|It {{is shown}} that, {{for the purpose}} of pricing swaptions, the swap rate and the {{corresponding}} forward rates can be considered lognormal under a single martingale measure. Swaptions can then be priced as options on a basket of lognormal assets and an approximation formula is derived for such options. This formula is centred around a Black-Scholes price with an appropriate volatility, plus a correction term that can be interpreted as the expected tracking error. The calibration problem can then be solved very efficiently using semidefinite programming. semidefinite programming, Libor market model, <b>calibration,</b> <b>basket</b> options,...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the price <b>calibration</b> of <b>basket</b> default swap from Japanese market data. The value of this {{instruments}} depend on the number of factors including credit rating of the obligors in the basket, recovery rates, intensity of default, basket size and the correlation of obligors in the basket. A fundamental part of the pricing framework is the estimation of the instantaneous default probabilities for each obligor. Because default probabilities depend on the credit quality of the considered obligor, well-calibrated credit curves are a main ingredient for constructing default times. The calibration of credit curves take into account internal information on credit migrations and default history. We refer to Japan Credit Rating Agency to obtain rating transition matrix and cumulative default rates. Default risk is often considered as a rare-event and then, many studies have shown that many distributions have fatter tails than those captured by the normal distribution. Subsequently, the choice of copula and the choice of procedures for rare-event simulation govern the pricing of basket credit derivatives. Joshi and Kainth (2004) introduced an Importance Sampling technique for rare-event that forces a predetermined number of defaults to occur on each path. We consider using Gaussian copula and t-student copula and study their impact on basket credit derivative prices. We will present an applicatio...|$|R
40|$|Most {{emerging}} markets do not borrow much internationally {{in their own}} currency, although doing that has been argued as an attractive insurance mechanism. This phenomenon, commonly labeled"the original sin", has mostly been interpreted {{as evidence of the}} countries'inability to borrow in domestic currency from abroad. This paper provides a novel explanation for that phenomenon: not that countries are unable to borrow abroad in their currency, they might not need to do so. In the model, the small prevalence of external borrowing in domestic currency arises as an equilibrium outcome, despite the absence of exogenous frictions or limits on market participation. The equilibrium outcome is driven by the fact that domestic and foreign lenders have differential consumption baskets. In particular, a large part of domestic lenders'consumption basket is denominated in domestic currency whereas all of foreign lenders'is in dollars. A depreciation of domestic currency, which tends to occur in bad times, is therefore less harmful to domestic savers than to foreign investors. This makes domestic lenders require a lower premium than foreign lenders on domestic currency debt. For plausible <b>calibrations,</b> this consumption <b>basket</b> effect can induce foreign investors {{to pull out of the}} domestic currency debt market.
