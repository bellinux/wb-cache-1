40|$|This {{research}} {{present the}} torque and exhaust emission level from four stroke indirect injection fuel system engine. An engine fueled by ethanol gasoline blend. The original Engine <b>Controle</b> <b>Module</b> injected lean mixture into Combustion Chamber. Lean Mixture decreased Torque drastically. Therefore, the Engine <b>Controle</b> <b>Module</b> was modified to produce stoichiometric mixture. Injector {{was controlled by}} digital pulse of Fuel Controller. Ethanol was added into gasoline 0 % - 100 % at 1500 rpm- 5000 rpm. The result demonstrate that increasing ethanol concentration into gasoline fuel system, decreasing Torque, and CO, HC, CO 2 emission. By increasing ethanol concentration also increase CO 2 emission to 34. 6 %...|$|E
