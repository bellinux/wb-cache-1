50|$|Until the {{building}} of the railway, <b>Cross</b> <b>Gates</b> was a quiet village. However, Leeds' industrialisation, as well as {{the building}} of the railway, developed <b>Cross</b> <b>Gates</b> into a 'commuter village'. At this time <b>Cross</b> <b>Gates</b> was 'well removed' from the city and the collieries {{to the west of the}} village, so <b>Cross</b> <b>Gates</b> began to attract Leeds' more affluent residents. Cross Gates' development however had always been attributable to its proximity to Leeds. Before 1900 there was little evidence of <b>Cross</b> <b>Gates,</b> and unlike nearby suburbs such as Halton, Seacroft and Austhorpe there is no mention of <b>Cross</b> <b>Gates</b> in the Domesday Book. The earliest housing in <b>Cross</b> <b>Gates</b> was built for the workers at <b>Cross</b> <b>Gates</b> Colliery.|$|R

50|$|In {{the twentieth}} century <b>Cross</b> <b>Gates</b> {{effectively}} became a suburb of Leeds, with the open fields in between being developed into housing. This also led to much development around <b>Cross</b> <b>Gates,</b> including {{the building of the}} <b>Cross</b> <b>Gates</b> estate, a development of council housing and private development around Austhorpe, Whitkirk and Manston. <b>Cross</b> <b>Gates</b> quickly outgrew its amenities, which led to the building of the Arndale Centre.|$|R

A level <b>crossing</b> <b>gate</b> concrete post survived at Chanter's Lane.

25|$|Over {{its history}} Grand Trunk Western has had rail yards and engine {{terminals}} located in Detroit, Battle Creek, Durand, Flat Rock, Flint, Grand Rapids, Pontiac, Port Huron, Blue Island, Illinois and Chicago. In {{each of the}} cities GTW had engine terminals and facilities for locomotive maintenance including roundhouses and turntables. Prior to 1910 the railroad constructed its major locomotive repair shops in Battle Creek and rail car repair and maintenance was handled by GTW's Port Huron car shops. Its major freight yards were Durand Yard and Pontiac Yard in the two Michigan cities that were major GTW junction pointes. There is also Nichols Yard in Battle Creek, Tunnel Yard in Port Huron, Torrey Yard near Flint and East Yard near the Milwaukee Junction area in the Detroit enclave of Hamtramck. City Yard was the railroad's rail yard on the Detroit riverfront adjacent to Brush Street Station and its ferry slip dock. The yard, dock and station were eventually all removed and redeveloped by 1975 for construction of the Renaissance Center. It also obtained the former Penn Central Winona Yard in Bay City when it acquired that trackage from Conrail in 1976. On Chicago's south side GTW's Elsdon Yard served as its primary yard and locomotive facility there since the railroad laid tracks into {{the city in the}} 1880s. GTW also had a smaller transfer yard south of Chicago near rail junctions Blue Island, Illinois. In 1975 GTW opened an intermodal freight terminal yard in Chicago known as Railport. The facility is in Chicago's Back of the Yards neighborhood and was formerly the Pennsylvania Railroad's Levitt Street Yard. GTW also increased intermodal operations in Detroit In 1976 when it expanded its Ferndale, Michigan railyard into an intermodal facility it called GT MoTerm. The Elsdon Yard was closed and abandoned by 1990 and has been redeveloped. Detroit, Toledo and Ironton's former hump classification yard in Flat Rock, which GTW acquired from its 1983 merger with DT still serves as an important freight hub for Canadian National. Several interlocking and <b>crossing</b> <b>gate</b> towers were also maintained by GTW through its history.|$|E

2500|$|A {{new device}} called [...] "StopGate" [...] has been {{installed}} at four locations, one in Madison, Wisconsin; another in Monroe, Wisconsin {{and two in}} Santa Clara, California (on a light rail system). This system resembles a fortified version of a standard <b>crossing</b> <b>gate,</b> with two larger arms blocking the entire width of the roadway and locking into a securing device {{on the side of}} the road opposite the gate pivot mechanism. The gate arms are reinforced with high-strength steel cable, which helps the gate absorb the impact of a vehicle attempting to crash through the gate. The manufacturer claims that the StopGate can stop a [...] truck within [...] Already the system has been tested at the Madison crossing, when the system stopped a truck while a Wisconsin and Southern Railroad train was in the crossing.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>crossing</b> <b>gate</b> {{struck the}} top of Brody's SUV before sliding down its rear and {{becoming}} stuck. Hope backed up to give her room to do the same. He instead saw Brody get out and walk to the rear, apparently trying to free it. [...] "What struck me was how calm she was—she didn't seem to be panicking, or in a hurry at all, even though the gate was down," [...] he said later. [...] "She wasn't in a hurry at all, {{but she had to}} have known that a train was coming." [...] Brody looked at him, and he motioned to her to come back in his direction, although he allows that she may not have seen him due to the glare from his headlights. Brody then returned to her vehicle and, according to Hope, seemed to pause as if she was adjusting her seat belt. The train was getting closer and the situation more urgent. [...] "The thing's dinging, red lights are flashing, it's going off," [...] he said. [...] "I just knew she was going to back up—never in my wildest dreams did I think she'd go forward." ...|$|E
