25|$|Conventional FT {{reactors}} {{have been}} optimized for massive coal-to-liquids and gas–liquid facilities such as Shell's Pearl GTL facility. These slurry bed and fixed-bed reactors are {{much larger than}} the sizes needed for biofuel facilities or for smaller-scale natural-gas fields. The use of microchannel reactors, such as those developed by Velocys, intensifies the reaction, scales down the size of the reaction hardware and overcomes the heat and mass transport problems associated with conventional FT technology. Enhanced heat transfer inside the microchannels reactor allows for optimal temperature control, which maximizes <b>catalyst</b> <b>activity</b> and life. While no smaller scale plant is currently in commercial operation, indications show capital costs, operating costs and size could all be reduced relative to conventional FT facilities.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} to construct catalytically active homochiral MOFs is to incorporate chiral metal complexes which are either active catalysts or precatalysts {{directly into the}} framework structures. For example, Hupp and coworkers have combined a chiral ligand and bpdc (bpdc: biphenyldicarboxylate) with Zn(NO3)2 and obtained twofold interpenetrating 3D networks. The orientation of chiral ligand in the frameworks makes all Mn(III) sites accessible through the channels. The resulting open frameworks showed catalytic activity towards asymmetric olefin epoxidation reactions. No significant decrease of <b>catalyst</b> <b>activity</b> was observed during the reaction and the catalyst could be recycled and reused several times. Lin and coworkers have reported zirconium phosphonate-derived Ru-BINAP systems. Zirconium phosphonate-based chiral porous hybrid materials containing the Ru(BINAP)(diamine)Cl2 precatalysts showed excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99.2% ee) in the asymmetric hydrogenation of aromatic ketones.|$|E

40|$|Hydrogenation of citral on {{monometallic}} (Pt) and bimetallic (Pt-Sn) catalysts was investigated.

Among monometallic catalysts, Pt/Na-Y was more selective to citronellol (3. 9 %) and unsaturated alcohols, geraniol and nerol, (14. 1 %). Sn addition increased the <b>catalyst</b> <b>activities.</b> However, its effect on product distribution differed. Yield of geraniol+nerol changed from 5. 1 % to 19. 7 % over Clino.

Unsaturated alcohol formation was favored when there was a metal support interaction over monometallic catalysts, and metal-promoter interaction over bimetallic catalyst.

2500|$|During {{the trip}} up the riser, the {{cracking}} catalyst is [...] "spent" [...] by reactions which deposit coke on the catalyst and greatly reduce activity and selectivity. The [...] "spent" [...] catalyst is disengaged from the cracked hydrocarbon vapors {{and sent to}} a stripper where it contacts steam to remove hydrocarbons remaining in the catalyst pores. The [...] "spent" [...] catalyst then flows into a fluidized-bed regenerator where air (or in some cases air plus oxygen) is used to burn off the coke to restore <b>catalyst</b> <b>activity</b> and also provide the necessary heat for the next reaction cycle, cracking being an endothermic reaction.

This condition is known as acid runaway. In SAAU recent studies have found that both butylenes and amylenes can be spent to a lower {{acid concentration}} without entering into a runaway condition. While the economics of alkylating both butylenes and amylenes will benefit from lowering the acid spending strength, the acid consumption of amylenes has a greater response than that of butylenes. Also the expected decrease in octane of alkylates produced at lower acid concentrations is less for amylenes than butylenes.|$|E
2500|$|Fischer–Tropsch iron {{catalysts}} need alkali {{promotion to}} attain high activity and stability (e.g. 0.5 wt% [...] ). Addition of Cu for reduction promotion, addition of , [...] for structural promotion {{and maybe some}} manganese can be applied for selectivity control (e.g. high olefinicity). The working catalyst is only obtained when—after reduction with hydrogen—in the initial period of synthesis several iron carbide phases and elemental carbon are formed whereas iron oxides are still present in addition to some metallic iron. With iron catalysts two directions of selectivity have been pursued. One direction has aimed at a low-molecular-weight olefinic hydrocarbon mixture to be produced in an entrained phase or fluid bed process (Sasol–Synthol process). Due to the relatively high reaction temperature (approx. 340nbsp&°C), the average molecular weight of the product is so low that no liquid product phase occurs under reaction conditions. The catalyst particles moving around in the reactor are small (particle diameter 100nbsp&µm) and carbon deposition on the catalyst does not disturb reactor operation. Thus a low catalyst porosity with small pore diameters as obtained from fused magnetite (plus promoters) after reduction with hydrogen is appropriate. For maximising the overall gasoline yield, C3 and C4 alkenes have been oligomerized at Sasol. However, recovering the olefins for use as chemicals in, e.g., polymerization processes is advantageous today. The second direction of iron catalyst development has aimed at highest <b>catalyst</b> <b>activity</b> to be used at low reaction temperature {{where most of the}} hydrocarbon product is in the liquid phase under reaction conditions. Typically, such catalysts are obtained through precipitation from nitrate solutions. A high content of a carrier provides mechanical strength and wide pores for easy mass transfer of the reactants in the liquid product filling the pores. The main product fraction then is a paraffin wax, which is refined to marketable wax materials at Sasol; however, it also can be very selectively hydrocracked to a high quality diesel fuel. Thus, iron catalysts are very flexible.|$|E
