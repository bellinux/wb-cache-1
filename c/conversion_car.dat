50|$|Other cars {{known to}} have been {{included}} were some BC vans, with one end fitted with dual couplings since the R Class locomotives - then the most popular choice for heritage steam specials - were not compatible with screw couplings. When the BC cars were removed from service, the function of <b>conversion</b> <b>cars</b> was taken up by ABU carriages, about half of which had dual- or screw-couplings on at least one end.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the latest}} revision, however, only 88 new cars {{were to be}} {{purchased}} to form 8 new 11-car trains, with 38 [...] "C" [...] cars, rather than ten 11-car trains. Likewise, the number of <b>conversion</b> <b>cars</b> was altered to 370. This change was made {{with the knowledge that}} only two ten-car R62A growth sets for the mainline IRT would be needed, as opposed to the projected four sets, and thus the MTA and Kawasaki opted to convert two additional R142A train sets in place of manufacturing two new sets. The MTA also decided to have Kawasaki perform all of the conversions at the Yonkers plant instead of 207th Street Shop as part of that contract modification.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is to apply vehicle routing problem with time series to a real case study. At first vehicle routing problem is classified into Operations Research and Travelling Salesman Problem. Then a simple vehicle routing problem and a multiple vehicle routing problem are described {{as well as their}} modifications with time series. Some heuristic algorithms and steps of nearest neighbour algorithm are described. The next part is focused on the application. It starts with introducing the company that is specialized in an exchange business and description of the situation that presents its assignments. There are three assignments in total. The first and second assignments are related to the optimization of cash delivery to company's branches. The second one also allows the company send a parcel with cash instead of its own delivery. The third assignment is to calculate whether a <b>conversion</b> <b>cars</b> into propellant gas is budget-wise or not. These assignments are solved and the results are commented...|$|R

50|$|In {{this setting}} (by tradition, fifty {{years ahead of}} the current time), {{characters}} are involved in autoduelling: combat in armed and armored motor vehicles such as cars, motorcycles, or semis. The sourcebook contains rules for designing vehicles, additional skills used by autoduellist characters, and new technology and social conditions of the world. Additional rules for <b>conversion</b> of <b>Car</b> Wars vehicles to GURPS Autoduel are included.|$|R

50|$|Production and <b>conversion</b> {{electric}} <b>cars</b> typically use 10 to 23 kW·h/100 km (0.17 to 0.37 kW·h/mi). Approximately 20% of {{this power}} consumption {{is due to}} inefficiencies in charging the batteries. Tesla Motors indicates that the vehicle efficiency (including charging inefficiencies) of their lithium-ion battery powered vehicle is 12.7 kW·h/100 km (0.21 kW·h/mi) and the well-to-wheels efficiency (assuming the electricity is generated from natural gas) is 24.4 kW·h/100 km (0.39 kW·h/mi).|$|R
5000|$|Modifying {{the engine}} to run an {{alternative}} fuel. These include natural gas <b>conversion</b> of gasoline-powered <b>cars</b> and Vegetable oil <b>conversion</b> of diesel <b>cars.</b> Cars with Diesel engines can be converted reasonably cheaply and easily to run on 100% vegetable oil. Vegetable oil is often cheaper and cleaner than petrodiesel, but local laws often levy harsh fines to users who fail to pay fuel taxes when acquiring their fuel outside regular distribution channels. Liquid nitrogen, Hydrogen fuel conversions and Ethanol conversions are other alternative fuel conversions {{that can be done}} with internal combustion engines. The first two will eliminate all vehicle emissions, while the third one will only slightly decrease emissions.|$|R
50|$|The Flexity streetcars {{were first}} {{introduced}} on the 510 Spadina line on August 31, 2014, {{with a full}} <b>conversion</b> to Flexity <b>cars</b> since January 3, 2016, making it the first fully wheelchair accessible TTC streetcar line in the city.|$|R
50|$|The three-car trains were {{converted}} from former Tokyu 8090 series <b>cars.</b> <b>Conversion</b> details include modifications for wanman driver-only operation, {{the addition of}} passenger door control buttons, and {{the replacement of the}} previous single-arm pantograph with two lozenge-type pantographs on the DeHa 7600 car.|$|R
25|$|A 1966 concept vehicle, the Electrovair II, was a 1966 Monza 4-door hardtop {{modified}} with a 532 volt 115-horsepower {{electric motor}} replacing the gasoline engine — following a 1964 version known as Electrovair I. With the 1966 model, silver-zinc batteries were used {{and placed in}} the trunk and engine compartment, and the body was slightly modified to accept the <b>conversion.</b> The <b>car</b> was handicapped by the high cost of the batteries ($160,000), a limited driving range (40–80 miles), and short battery life.|$|R
50|$|Congress has {{encouraged}} <b>conversion</b> of <b>cars</b> to CNG {{with a tax}} credits of up to 50 percent of the auto conversion cost and the CNG home filling station cost. However, while CNG is much cleaner fuel, the conversion requires a type certificate from the EPA. Meeting the requirements of a type certificate can cost up to $50,000. Other non-EPA approved kits are available. A complete and safe aftermarket conversion using a non-EPA approved kit can be achieved {{for as little as}} $400 without the cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|In 1915 Ray H. Muscott of Waters, Michigan, {{received}} the Canadian patent for his motor sleigh, or [...] "traineau automobile", and on June 27, 1916, he {{received the}} first United States patent for a snow-vehicle using the now recognized format of rear track(s) and front skis. Many individuals later modified Ford Model Ts with the undercarriage replaced by tracks and skis following this design. They were popular for rural mail delivery for a time. The common name for these <b>conversion</b> of <b>cars</b> and small trucks was Snowflyers.|$|R
50|$|Below, is a {{complete}} listing of nearly all cars converted by the U.S. coach convertible industry from the mid-1970s into the 1990s. This list does not include kit <b>car</b> <b>conversions</b> or one-off conversions. All {{are believed to have}} been series runs and no ultra-expensive cars are included.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{there are}} {{pollutants}} {{involved in the}} manufacture and destruction of a car and the production, transmission and storage of electricity and hydrogen, {{the use of the}} label [...] "zero pollution" [...] should be understood as applying only to the <b>car's</b> <b>conversion</b> of stored energy into transportation.|$|R
50|$|The Citroën C1 ev'ie is an {{electric}} <b>car</b> <b>conversion</b> from a standard Citroën C1 by the now defunct Electric Car Corporation. The model was first released on 30 April 2009, with a 2010 list price of £19,860 ($30,890 US) {{this makes the}} C1 ev'ie a competitively priced electric car.|$|R
5000|$|He {{worked for}} many of the world's leading {{magazines}} including Evo, Car, Autocar, <b>Cars</b> and <b>Car</b> <b>Conversions,</b> Motor Sport and also newspapers such as the Daily Telegraph. He was a close personal friend of racing driver Ayrton Senna and his interview with the Brazilian racer is highly regarded.|$|R
2500|$|Many Model Ts were {{converted}} into vehicles which could travel across heavy snows with kits {{on the rear}} wheels (sometimes with an extra pair of rear-mounted wheels and two sets of continuous track to mount on the now-tandemed rear wheels, essentially making it a half-track) and skis replacing the front wheels. They were popular for rural mail delivery for a time. [...] The common name for these <b>conversions</b> of <b>cars</b> and small trucks was [...] "snowflyers". These vehicles were extremely popular in the northern reaches of Canada, where factories were set up to produce them.|$|R
50|$|Early {{examples}} include the Bond Minicar from 1949 which used a 122 cc Villiers motorcycle engine. More recently, <b>conversions</b> of small <b>cars</b> such as the Mini have started to emerge, since conversion kits have become more available. Bike-engined cars are often based on the Lotus 7-type kit cars, such as the Westfield Megabusa.|$|R
5000|$|Interestingly, for a {{car that}} was {{distinctive}} (particularly in its body lines), {{it was actually a}} popular car with professional car converters, namely Crayford Engineering, Torcars (who both did <b>conversions</b> of the <b>car</b> to hatchback form - sold confusingly as [...] "Princess Estate") and Woodall-Nicholson - who built stretched limousine and hearse variants.|$|R
50|$|Though it {{continued}} to trade Harold Radford (Coachbuilders) Limited was placed in voluntary liquidation in September 1966 because it was unable to meet its liabilities. A new company, Harold Radford Coachbuilders (1967) Limited, was formed in October 1967 to acquire and continue and improve the <b>car</b> <b>conversion</b> business and it {{took control of the}} business on 10 October 1967.|$|R
25|$|P Stock {{was ordered}} to replace all the {{remaining}} Metropolitan multiple units. A combination of 3-car units and 2-car units, to run in 6- and 8-car lengths, was delivered from July 1939. Two trailers were included in an 8-car formation, but these were designed to allow <b>conversion</b> to motor <b>cars</b> {{at a later date}} after improvements to the power supply.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{was in fact}} {{an early}} example of badge engineering. Rather than build cars, Arsenault {{imported}} American built Davis cars, changed the nameplates to [...] "Derby" [...] and added [...] "Derby" [...] tire covers. <b>Conversion</b> of the <b>cars</b> {{took place in the}} former Marshall tractor factory in Saskatoon. The Derby used a Continental six-cylinder engine, and came in four different models: ...|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the years, Chase built one-cylinder, three-cylinder and four-cylinder engines; {{all were}} two-strokes. Aurin Chase {{designed}} his trucks for a smooth <b>conversion</b> to a <b>car</b> {{and back to}} truck as needed; [...] "being high wheelers, they looked perhaps a little strange when configured as cars, but when wearing truck bodies as “expresses” or “runabouts,” they looked much like early Brockways." ...|$|R
50|$|The 1969-1976 Porsche 914 {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{successful}} sports <b>car</b> <b>conversions,</b> as well as being one of the most popular. Once converted, it boasts better performance in range, acceleration and top speed than most other vehicles. Also, its low acquisition costs contributes to its popularity as a conversion candidate. Some manufacturers of conversion kits have made a kit specific to the 914.|$|R
5000|$|... 8.3 million LPG {{cars are}} {{passenger}} vehicles. 33% {{of the passenger}} cars (2,739,000) are diesel powered and 67% are petrol powered (5,561,000). As there is no <b>conversion</b> to diesel <b>cars,</b> among 5,561,000 petrol powered passenger cars, According to the reports of the MMO, (Chamber of Mechanical Engineers, authorized to check emissions and licenses) there were 3.1 million LPG fueled vehicles {{by the end of}} the year 2011.|$|R
50|$|In 1982 two AS carriages, 11 and 2, were {{converted}} to BS 1 and 2 respectively, recycling {{the identities of the}} first two second class S type carriages. This was {{around the time of the}} introduction of the N type carriages and <b>conversion</b> of AZ <b>cars</b> to ACZ, which meant that all trains automatically included first class accommodation; as a result loose first class carriages were generally no longer required.|$|R
50|$|The Bedford Beagle was {{an estate}} <b>car</b> <b>conversion</b> of the Bedford HA 8cwt van, which itself {{was based on}} the Vauxhall Viva HA. The {{conversions}} were undertaken by Martin Walter Ltd in Folkestone, Kent, most famous for Dormobile campers based upon the larger Bedford CA commercial vans. Whilst the vans were very common at one time, the Beagle was altogether rarer and there are very few left today.|$|R
5000|$|Mercedes-Benz Chief Engineer Rudolf Uhlenhaut liked {{pushing the}} power {{envelope}} of his cars. In 1965, he fitted a 250 SL with the massive 6332 cc L [...] M100 V8 engine from the Mercedes-Benz 600. This engine <b>conversion</b> gave the <b>car,</b> denoted as W 113/12, impressive power, but {{made it very}} front-heavy, so that this direction was abandoned. The car was eventually destroyed, the usual procedure for test vehicles at the time.|$|R
