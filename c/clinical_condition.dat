40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the patterns of multimorbidities of oral <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions</b> in children. The association between social position and number of oral <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions,</b> and the relationship of social position and number of oral <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions</b> with oral health-related quality of life [OHRQoL, measured using the Brazilian Child-Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (Child-OIDP) ] were also investigated. The study analysed data on 7, 208 children, 12 yr of age, from the Brazilian Oral Health Survey (SBBrasil Project). Cluster analysis based on the observed/expected (O/E) ratios identified six significant clusters of oral clinical conditions: (i) dental caries and missing teeth; (ii) dental caries and dental trauma; (iii) dental trauma and gingivitis; (iv) dental caries, missing teeth, and dental trauma; (v) dental caries, dental trauma, and gingivitis; and (vi) all oral <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions.</b> Ordinal regression showed that poor social position was associated with a large number of oral <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions.</b> Poisson regression demonstrated that low social position and greater number of oral <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions</b> increased the likelihood of poor OHRQoL (Child-OIDP extent). The four oral <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions</b> clustered into six distinct clusters among Brazilian children. Multimorbidity of oral <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions</b> predicted poor OHRQoL. Social position was of high relevance to multimorbidity of oral <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions</b> and children's OHRQoL...|$|R

25|$|Hyperkalemic {{periodic}} paralysis is an {{autosomal dominant}} <b>clinical</b> <b>condition</b> {{where there is}} a mutation in gene located at 17q23 that regulates the production of protein SCN4A. SCN4A is an important component of sodium channels in skeletal muscles. During exercise, sodium channels would open to allow influx of sodium into the muscle cells for depolarisation to occur. But in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, sodium channels are slow to close after exercise, causing excessive influx of sodium and displacement of potassium out of the cells.|$|E

Five major clinical syndromes have been described: febrile purpura, malignant chickenpox with purpura, postinfectious purpura, purpura fulminans, and anaphylactoid purpura. These syndromes have variable courses, with febrile purpura being the most benign of the syndromes and having an uncomplicated outcome.
