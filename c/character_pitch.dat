5000|$|Several {{species of}} pines {{characteristic}} of the Appalachians are eastern white pine (...) , Virginia pine (...) , pitch pine (...) , Table Mountain pine (...) and shortleaf pine (...) [...] Red pine (...) is a boreal species that forms a few high elevation outliers {{as far south as}} West Virginia. All of these species except white pine tend to occupy sandy, rocky, poor soil sites, which are mostly acidic in character. White pine, a large species valued for its timber, tends to do best in rich, moist soil, either acidic or alkaline in <b>character.</b> <b>Pitch</b> pine is also at home in acidic, boggy soil, and Table Mountain pine may occasionally be found in this habitat as well. Shortleaf pine is generally found in warmer habitats and at lower elevations than the other species. All the species listed do best in open or lightly shaded habitats, although white pine also thrives in shady coves, valleys, and on floodplains.The Appalachians are characterized by a wealth of large, beautiful deciduous broadleaf (hardwood) trees. Their occurrences are best summarized and described in E. Lucy Braun's 1950 classic, Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America (Macmillan, New York). The most diverse and richest forests are the mixed mesophytic or medium moisture types, which are largely confined to rich, moist montane soils of the southern and central Appalachians, particularly in the Cumberland and Allegheny Mountains, but also thrive in the southern Appalachian coves. Characteristic canopy species are white basswood (...) , yellow buckeye (...) , sugar maple (...) , American beech (...) , tuliptree (...) , white ash (...) and yellow birch (...) [...] Other common trees are red maple (...) , shagbark and bitternut hickories (...) and black or sweet birch (...) [...] Small understory trees and shrubs include flowering dogwood (...) , hophornbeam (...) , witch-hazel (...) and spicebush (...) [...] There are also hundreds of perennial and annual herbs, among them such herbal and medicinal plants as American ginseng (...) , goldenseal (...) , bloodroot (...) and black cohosh (...)

In the review for Rediff, Shobha Warrier stated that although the film had [...] "too many songs, too little emotion" [...] it [...] "had a powerful story with intense and well-developed characters. One of the most poignant scenes in the film is Mammootty's outburst against the system, which forgets war heroes who lay down their lives for a cause". The film successfully completed 150 days at the box office in Tamil Nadu. Menon chose to bring the film to North Indian audiences too, but opted against dubbing the film and submitted a final copy with English subtitles. He felt that the strong elements of Carnatic music, Subramanya Bharathi's poetry and the ambience of Karaikudi, were exclusively made for a Tamil backdrop. It was later released by Shyam Shroff of Shringar Films in limited cinemas in Mumbai and New Delhi, earning rave reviews from critics and doing reasonable business at the box-office. Shroff revealed [...] "although the film didn't make pots of money - high theatre rentals and escalating costs of publicity kept profits to a minimal amount -- it created tremendous brand equity".

50|$|Christ {{always has}} {{the longest and}} lowest notes, {{creating}} a stark contrast with the other <b>characters.</b> The <b>pitch</b> center for Christ is E, and it {{is accompanied by a}} drone and T-voice in the organ. For the turba, the pitch center is again E. The alto and bass voices, again always playing an M role, are mirrored, and the soprano and tenor T-voices alternate above and below the M-voices. While both are centered on E, the M-voices use E Phrygian against E major in the T-voices; this makes for striking cross-relations between G-natural and G-sharp, though the two never sound at the same time. Pilate, like Christ, is accompanied only by the organ, but sings in faster rhythmic values and has a higher tessitura. Pilate's part is the most unstable in the piece, created in part through the use of an M-voice centered on B and a T-voice centered on F (a tritone apart) and through the refusal of Pilate to be either a T-voice or M-voice, always alternating between these two roles.|$|R

Over the last few years, {{there has been an}} abundance of data having inherent structure with strong correlation and complex dependencies between different parts of each input. Numerous applications across different disciplines like Part Of Speech tagging, Optical <b>Character</b> Recognition, <b>Pitch</b> accent prediction among others underline the structure in the data which needs to be captured by standard learning algorithms to perform better than standard multivariate classification/regression. In this paper, we survey the existing structured prediction approaches for both training and inference. We show how the different existing training algorithms (maximum margin methods and maximum log-likelihood methods) are extensions of Empirical Risk Minimization schemes to the structured prediction domain. We also review the standard graphical model formalism-which is used to inherently define the structure in most complex data- and the corresponding assumptions which lead to efficient training and prediction algorithms. Most of the existing structured prediction methods heavily depend on the use of joint kernels which do not easily allow them to learn from unlabeled data. Finally we provide a new scheme based on vector valued functions, which provides a rich framework for training an...|$|R
500|$|In early 1997, Warner Bros. {{approached}} cult filmmaker {{and comic}} book writer Kevin Smith, who had then just finished writing Superman Lives, to script a Green Lantern film. Smith {{turned down the}} offer, believing there were more suitable candidates to make a Green Lantern film. At one point Quentin Tarantino was offered the chance to write and direct. Warner also considered the property as an action comedy; by 2004, Robert Smigel had completed a script which was set to star Jack Black in the lead role. However, the studio dropped the comedy idea following poor fan reaction from the Internet. David S. Goyer was offered the chance to write and direct either a Green Lantern or Flash film after Warner Bros. was impressed with his screenplay for Batman Begins, but he opted to direct the latter. Actor-writer Corey Reynolds, a comic book fan of the John Stewart <b>character,</b> <b>pitched</b> Warner {{an idea for a}} trilogy, with him starring as John Stewart and performing screenwriting duties. Reynolds intended to introduce Hal Jordan, the Green Lantern Corps and Justice League in possible sequels. He finished the script for Green Lantern: Birth of a Hero in June 2007, receiving positive feedback from Warner Bros. with a potential 2010 release date. However, the studio abandoned Reynolds' concept, and in October 2007, Greg Berlanti signed to direct the film and co-write it with comic-book writers Michael Green and Marc Guggenheim. A draft of the trio's 2008 script, leaked on the Internet, revealed a story that included the hero's origin and included the characters Carol Ferris, Kilowog, Sinestro, and Guy Gardner in a cameo appearance, and appeared [...] "to set up Hector Hammond as Hal Jordan's ... first major nemesis...." [...] Shortly afterward, Guggenheim said that the script would contain characterizations inspired by the Denny O'Neil-Neal Adams run on the comic in the 1970s, and Dave Gibbons' work in the early 1980s. He added that he and his co-writers also looked to the 2000s Geoff Johns stories, saying, [...] "It’s been interesting because we finished a draft just before [...] '' [...] started up. [...] "So I’ve been reading 'Secret Origin' with a real interest in seeing 'OK, how did Geoff solve this problem?' There are certain elements just for anyone trying to retell Hal’s origin for a modern day audience has to address and grapple with. For example, why the hell was Abin [...] flying in a space ship when he's a Green Lantern? You don't ask that question back in the Silver Age, but when you're writing in the Modern Age, you have to answer these things." ...|$|R
