40|$|A new {{approach}} involving the in situ hydrolysis of diethyl carbonate in calcium-containing solution was {{proposed for the}} controlled precipitation of CaCO 3. CaCO 3 crystals with exqui-site morphologies and colors have been fabricated through this approach {{in the presence of}} organic molecules. Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), an important kind of biominer-al, widely exists in the lower <b>creatures</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhibits</b> a rich diver-sity of peculiar morphologies. 1 Controlled precipitation of CaCO 3 crystals under mild conditions mimicking the slow min-eralization process in nature is critical {{to the study of the}} biomi-neralization process under laboratory conditions. Three ap-proaches have been developed for the controlled precipitation of CaCO 3 : gas diffusion method, 2 double-jet technique, 3 and Kitano procedure. 4 However, some defects such as low reprodu-cibility, 5 vigorous stir (unlike the static conditions in natural biomineralization), and time-consuming operation still exist in the above approaches. Urea has been used as the in situ CO 3 2 source in hydrothermal 6 or solvothermal 7 growth of vaterite (a metastable polymorph of CaCO 3). However, the high decom-position temperature of urea in solution (ca. 100 C) was obvi-ously unacceptable in biological systems, which greatly restrict-ed its application in the study of biomineralization process of CaCO 3. Therefore, a simple and controllable approach to fabri-cate CaCO 3 under mild conditions is still desirable. It has been reported that the interaction between organic bi-omolecules and CaCO 3 crystals is of pivotal importance in con-trolling the morphology and/or the polymorph of CaCO 3 in the natural biomineralization process. 1 Recently, to study such or-ganic–inorganic interaction, various biomacromolecules directly extracted from creatures and synthetic compounds/macromole-cules have been added in the biomimetic synthesis of CaCO 3. 8 Notably, some organic dyes have been applied in staining CaCO 3 crystals to distinguish the different crystalline poly-morph of CaCO 3. 9 Suc...|$|E
5000|$|Jondalar {{is known}} to be decent, stubborn, and {{extremely}} emotional; the major indiscretions in his life (the affair with Zolena, the assault on Ladroman, the emotional vampirism of First Rites) have all been precipitated by the intensity of his emotion and his lack of self-control. He supposedly gained some control during his years living with the Lanzadonii, but Ayla's brief relationship with Ranec caused an explosion of jealousy which belies this idea. He has also been endowed with a [...] "prodigious manhood," [...] and, as no woman has had the ability to accept his full measure save Ayla, he has been unable to find total abandon and sexual fulfillment, despite some gratification. In a bit of heavy-handed symbolism on Auel's part, his emotional intensity parallels his physical prowess; on every level he is forced to hold back, for fear that he will overwhelm and hurt his partner, and the only woman with the emotional and physical depths to fully accommodate him is the heroine, Ayla. Finally, he is a very physical <b>creature,</b> <b>and</b> has <b>exhibited</b> the practice of measuring distances quite accurately by judging them against his own height (6'6"), the length of his stride, and so on.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to exploring Alabama’s natural heritage, the museum features diorama-style exhibits that begin in pre-history and {{extend to the}} North American wilderness and the African savannah. Each of the museum's seven exhibit halls explores a different natural history theme. The Environments of Africa Hall contains more than 100 African animals displayed in simulated natural settings. Other highlights include 2,000-year-old Egyptian mummies from the Ptolemaic period, a cave-dwelling <b>creatures</b> <b>exhibit</b> <b>and</b> a children’s discovery room. The Dynamic Earth depicts the planet's formation and includes minerals, fossils, gemstones and dinosaurs. Nature Space offers a large learning area with hands-on activities. On the grounds are a wildlife garden, open-air animal <b>exhibits,</b> nature trails <b>and</b> the Berman Museum of World History.|$|R
500|$|Development of Sonic Adventure 2 began {{following}} {{the completion of}} its predecessor.

The development team also expanded upon the presence of the Chao <b>creatures</b> <b>and</b> other player characters. Its locations were influenced by U.S. landscapes such as San Francisco and Yosemite National Park. The game was announced in October 1999 <b>and</b> <b>exhibited</b> at E3 2000.|$|R
