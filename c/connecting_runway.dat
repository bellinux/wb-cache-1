50|$|A taxiway is a {{path for}} {{aircraft}} at an airport <b>connecting</b> <b>runways</b> with aprons, hangars, terminals and other facilities. They mostly have a hard surface such as asphalt or concrete, although smaller general aviation airports sometimes use gravel or grass.|$|R
50|$|The song's {{music video}} {{features}} Erasure performing the song on a futuristic stage with a long, <b>connected</b> <b>runway</b> which extends {{out into the}} audience. As Bell dances down the runway, it is revealed that the floor is covered in water - these shots were filmed in London's Leadenhall Market. Vince Clarke is also seen playing a circular keyboard similar to one previously used by Jean Michel Jarre.|$|R
50|$|The airport's {{single runway}} {{direction}} is 070/250, having {{a length of}} 3,306 meters and a width of 60 meters. There are six taxiways <b>connecting</b> the <b>runway</b> with the terminal.|$|R

25|$|Today the {{airfield}} {{is home to}} a small number of warehouses however the original basic layout can still be made out, including the runways and a large amount of the perimeter track which used to <b>connect</b> the <b>runways</b> with the dispersal hardstandings and the technical site.|$|R
40|$|The airport ground {{movement}} {{problem is}} one of the most important among airport ground operations as it <b>connects</b> <b>runway</b> sequencing and the gate or stand allocation problem. The main goal of the ground movement problem is to find optimal routes and schedules for all aircraft moving on the airport surface. With increasing air traffic, rising fuel costs and tighter environmental targets the efficient operation of the ground movement in terms of time and fuel consumption is becoming a more pressing issue. Therefore, in this paper a multi-objective optimisation problem is presented to simultaneously optimise departure schedules and speed profiles of taxiing aircraft. To solve this problem a genetic algorithm is adopted to investigate the trade-off between the total taxi time and fuel consumption. The experimental results, using real airport data, highlight the potential trade-off that can be achieved by selecting different speed profiles...|$|R
50|$|McCollum Field {{opened in}} 1960 {{with a single}} 4,000-foot (1,219 m) runway.

50|$|A new {{parallel}} runway 02R/20L (named 01/19 when opened in 2004) was built 1.8 km {{to the east}} of 02C/20C, currently used only by Republic of Singapore Air Force aircraft as part of Changi Airbase (East). The existing Runway 3, currently used by the military, will be extended from 2.75 km to 4 km to handle larger passenger aircraft. Almost 40 km of new taxiways will also be built to <b>connect</b> the <b>runway</b> with the current airport. New facilities such as navigation aids, airfield lighting systems and a fire station will need to be built as well.|$|R
50|$|With the NATO {{facility}} closed, {{the facility}} {{was turned over}} by the French Air Ministry to the local government. A {{small part of the}} large NATO air base has been converted into a civil airport, with about 3000' of the 5000' 08/26 secondary runway being maintained as the airport's runway. Parallel to the runway, a short grass runway has been built for glider use. An asphalt taxiway <b>connects</b> the <b>runway</b> to a small parking/ramp area used by light aircraft, with what appears to be NATO-era buildings being used as support buildings for the airport and several hangars.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aerodromes}} reference altitude is [...] above mean sea level.

50|$|In 2016, Perth International Airport {{adopted the}} SIM {{and they had}} their power {{distribution}} network modelled using this technology. The electrical components and cable objects in their SIM {{are linked to the}} objects in their geographic information system (GIS). This seamlessly provides full system technical and geographical information about all their electrical system components and cables. Perth Airport has plans to expand the use of SIM to their other <b>connected</b> systems like <b>runway</b> lighting systems, and communication networks.|$|R
5000|$|With a canal fully {{separating}} {{a portion}} of the island from the rest of it, Davis Islands is technically an archipelago, hence the plural form [...] "Islands" [...] in its name. Originally, Davis Islands consisted of three islands. With the construction of the airport, however, the end of one canal was filled in to make enough land area for a <b>runway,</b> <b>connecting</b> the two largest islands at their southern ends and reducing the archipelago's island count to two.|$|R
5000|$|Construction was rapid {{given the}} {{emergency}} wartime conditions and {{within three months}} the post was to be in full operation. The airfield consisted of four concrete runways 6100x150(N/S), 5500x150(NE/SW), 6100x150(E/W), 6100x150(NW/SE) taxiways with the runways laid out on an [...] "A" [...] layout, with one extended length main runway, and two short secondary <b>runways</b> <b>connected</b> to an extended, large aircraft parking apron capable of parking several hundred aircraft in an overlapping squares, or [...] "star" [...] layout {{with a series of}} taxiways.|$|R
25|$|Four {{parallel}} tunnels {{under the}} northern <b>runway</b> <b>connect</b> the M4 Heathrow spur and the A4 road to Terminals 2–3. The two larger tunnels are each two lanes wide {{and are used}} for motorised traffic. The two smaller tunnels were originally reserved for pedestrians and bicycles; to increase traffic capacity the cycle lanes have been modified to each take a single lane of cars, although bicycles still have priority over cars. Pedestrian access to the smaller tunnels has been discontinued, with the free bus services being used instead.|$|R
50|$|Built in 1951 as Anchorage International Airport, {{the airport}} was {{served in the}} 1950s by Alaska Airlines, Northwest Orient, Pacific Northern Airlines and Reeve Aleutian Airways, using {{aircraft}} ranging from Douglas DC-3s to Boeing 377s, and was also a refueling stop for Canadian Pacific Air Lines service to the Far East (one such aircraft being involved in a 1951 disappearance). From 1955 to 2011, {{the eastern end of}} the airport's southernmost <b>runway</b> <b>connected</b> to the Kulis Air National Guard Base, which was located on land leased by the airport.|$|R
50|$|The airport has two {{parallel}} runways with {{a length of}} 4000 m each, in addition to taxiways parallel to the runways and a cross taxiway to <b>connect</b> the two <b>runways.</b> A distance of 2146 m separates the two runways to facilitate simultaneous takeoff and landing operations. For more convenience and shorter taxiing durations, the east runway is usually used by Saudi Aramco while commercial airlines use the west one; however situation changes {{if one of the}} runways is undergoing maintenance. Space has been set aside {{for the construction of a}} third parallel runway.|$|R
50|$|The airport uses {{a single}} east-west <b>runway,</b> <b>connected</b> by two taxiways at its midsection, with turning bays {{at the end}} for back-tracking. As {{a result of the}} trade winds that blow {{northeast}} across Saint Lucia, all aircraft usually arrive and depart in an easterly direction. This results in a typical flight path for arriving aircraft along the west coast of Saint Lucia, while departing flights usually fly along the east coast of the island. On relatively rare occasions, weather disturbances such as passing hurricanes or tropical systems may force planes to take off or land in a westerly direction.|$|R
