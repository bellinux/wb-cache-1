5|$|Time {{passes and}} Harry {{receives}} {{a note from}} Kate, his sweetheart, that his mother is very ill and wants him to return. In the note, Kate states {{that it is impossible}} to prove his innocence. Harry escapes on a passing wagon, concealed in <b>corn</b> <b>or</b> hay, and returns home. The police gather and surround search the home, Harry escapes via a clothesline to another building, successfully eluding the police. The following morning, Harry buys a newspaper from a newspaperboy and reads of his innocence after the real thief confesses to the crime. The three rejoice at his proven innocence.|$|E
5|$|Various legal {{definitions}} of beer exist in different countries. Historically, {{the most famous}} of these was the Reinheitsgebot, which applied to parts of the Holy Roman Empire and Germany and required beer to be made from only water, hops, and barley. Today in Canada, the Canadian Government’s Food and Drug Regulations state that beer must have alcohol content that ranges from 1.1% to 8.6%, though it also includes a stipulation that it could be greater than 8.6% and labeled accordingly. Beer in South Korea must have less than 25% ABV, which means {{that it has to be}} 25 mL of alcohol or less per 100 mL of solution and can be considered ‘lite’ only if it has less than 30 kcal per 100ml. Additionally, beer in South Korea must use only water, hops, and starches (wheat, rice, barley, <b>corn,</b> <b>or</b> potato) as ingredients in the brewing process. In Singapore, beer must have at minimum 1.0% alcohol by volume concentration at 20°C. It is often brewed from a mixture of grains like malt, sugars or its equivalent, and hops or other vegetables.|$|E

25|$|Deriving {{too much}} of one's diet from a single source, such as eating almost {{exclusively}} <b>corn</b> <b>or</b> rice, can cause malnutrition. This may either be {{from a lack of}} education about proper nutrition, or from only having access to a single food source.|$|E
25|$|Plastics are {{typically}} organic polymers of high molecular mass, {{but they often}} contain other substances. They are usually synthetic, most commonly derived from petrochemicals, but many are made from renewable materials such as polylactic acid from <b>corn</b> <b>or</b> cellulosics from cotton linters.|$|E

25|$|In Latin America, chicha {{is still}} widely {{produced}} {{by women and}} consumed daily by adults and children, as it typically has a low alcohol content. In Ecuador women harvest yucca, boil the roots, pound it into a paste and then chew the paste, {{in much the same}} way as their ancestors did, to break down the starches and begin the fermentation process. Peruvian women make their version of chicha using the same method, but with corn. In Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, among Amazonian Indians, chicha, made from <b>corn,</b> <b>or</b> algarroba beer made from carob seed, as well as beer produced from mixing <b>corn</b> <b>or</b> manioc with apples, melons, papaya, pears, pumpkin, quince, strawberries and sweet potatoes are brewed by women. Bolivian women make beer from roasted barley, which is then chewed to begin the fermentation process and is served daily as a dietary supplement.|$|E
25|$|Kvass {{has been}} a common drink in Eastern Europe {{since at least the}} Middle Ages, {{comparable}} with other ancient fermented grain beverages including beer brewed from barley by the ancient Egyptians, the pombe or millet beer of Africa, the so-called rice wines of Asia, the chicha made with <b>corn</b> <b>or</b> cassava by the natives of America. Kvass was invented by the Slavs and became the most popular among East Slavs.|$|E

25|$|A TV {{dinner in}} the United States usually {{consists}} of a cut of meat, usually beef or chicken; a vegetable, such as peas, carrots, <b>corn,</b> <b>or</b> potatoes; and sometimes a dessert, such as a brownie or apple cobbler. The main dish could also be pasta or a common type of fish, such as Atlantic cod. Rice is a common side item. In Europe, items such as Indian or Chinese meals are common.|$|E
25|$|This {{region is}} {{regarded}} as perhaps the one most influenced by Native Americans, and its foods are {{closely linked to the}} Andean-Incan tradition. When preparing regional dishes, potatoes and <b>corn</b> <b>or</b> wheat are almost always used, including quinoa (a cereal typically used in Incan cuisine), peppers, squashes and tomatoes. The most celebrated dishes are humita and tamal, in which the corn husk is stuffed with the corn filling itself, seasonings or meat.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Gingrich {{released}} the book A Contract with the Earth, co-written with Terry Maple. In the book, Gingrich presented his policies for a market-based approach to environmentalism that incentivizes conservation and green technology, {{rather than relying}} on regulations or litigation. In particular, Gingrich has proposed using monetary prizes and tax incentives to spur environmentally friendly innovations, such as hydrogen engines, 100-mile-per-gallon conventional fuel engines and ethanol fuels that do not rely on <b>corn</b> <b>or</b> cane sugar.|$|E

25|$|For each billion ethanol-equivalent {{gallons of}} fuel {{produced}} and combusted in the US, the combined climate-change and health costs are $469 million for gasoline, $472–952 million for corn ethanol depending on biorefinery heat source (natural gas, <b>corn</b> stover, <b>or</b> coal) and technology, but only $123–208 million for cellulosic ethanol depending on feedstock (prairie biomass, Miscanthus, <b>corn</b> stover, <b>or</b> switchgrass).|$|R
25|$|People enjoy home-made recipes such as parantha, {{especially}} at breakfast, and other Punjabi foods like roti {{which is made}} from wheat, <b>corn,</b> <b>or</b> other glutenous flour with cooked vegetables or beans. Sarson da saag and dal makhani are well-known dishes among others. Popular snacks include gol gappa (known as panipuri in other places). It consists of a round, hollow puri, fried crisp and filled {{with a mixture of}} flavoured water, boiled and cubed potatoes, bengal gram beans, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of ethanol from sugar cane is more energy efficient than from <b>corn</b> <b>or</b> sugar beets or palm/vegetable oils, particularly if cane bagasse {{is used to}} produce heat and power for the process. Furthermore, if biofuels are used for crop production and transport, the fossil energy input needed for each ethanol energy unit can be very low. EIA estimates that with an integrated sugar cane to ethanol technology, the well-to-wheels CO2 emissions can be 90 percent lower than conventional gasoline.|$|E
25|$|Glucosamine (C6H13NO5) is an amino {{sugar and}} a {{prominent}} precursor in the biochemical synthesis of glycosylated proteins and lipids. Glucosamine {{is part of}} the structure of the polysaccharides chitosan and chitin, which compose the exoskeletons of crustaceans and other arthropods, as well as the cell walls of fungi and many higher organisms. Glucosamine is one of the most abundant monosaccharides. It is produced commercially by the hydrolysis of crustacean exoskeletons or, less commonly, by fermentation of a grain such as <b>corn</b> <b>or</b> wheat.|$|E
50|$|Companion {{or second}} crop {{planting}} can dramatically increase rootworm populations. <b>Corn</b> with pumpkins <b>or</b> <b>corn</b> following pumpkins {{are examples of}} planting patterns that exacerbate rootworm feeding pressure.|$|R
50|$|In {{times before}} modern machinery, sweet <b>corn</b> was pulled <b>or</b> jerked from the stalk. The leaves were shucked {{off and the}} golden ears were thrown in a wooden wagon pulled {{by a team of}} mules. This was Cornjerking, In other parts of the United States, this {{harvesting}} process may have been known as corn snapping, <b>corn</b> shucking, <b>or</b> <b>corn</b> husking. The many laborers who walked the fields to harvest the crops were called Cornjerkers.|$|R

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{process for}} use in industrial settings has been developed known as enzymatic nixtamalization which uses protease enzymes to accelerate the changes that occur in traditional nixtamalization. In this process, <b>corn</b> <b>or</b> corn meal is first partially hydrated in hot water, so that enzymes can penetrate the grain, then soaked briefly (for approximately 30 minutes) at 50°–60°C in an alkaline solution containing protease enzymes. A secondary enzymatic digestion may follow to further dissolve the pericarp. The resulting nixtamal is ground {{with little or no}} washing or hulling.|$|E
25|$|Isotope ratio mass {{spectrometry}} {{can be used}} to detect addition of corn syrup and cane sugar by the carbon isotopic signature. Addition of sugars originating from <b>corn</b> <b>or</b> sugar cane (C4 plants, unlike the plants used by bees, and also sugar beet, which are predominantly C3 plants) skews the isotopic ratio of sugars present in honey, but does not influence the isotopic ratio of proteins. In an unadulterated honey, the carbon isotopic ratios of sugars and proteins should match. Levels as low as 7% of addition can be detected.|$|E
25|$|Bioethanol is {{an alcohol}} made by fermentation, mostly from {{carbohydrates}} produced in sugar or starch {{crops such as}} <b>corn</b> <b>or</b> sugarcane. Cellulosic biomass, derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production. Ethanol {{can be used as}} a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the USA and in Brazil. Current plant design does not provide for converting the lignin portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.|$|E
