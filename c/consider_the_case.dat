5|$|Section 1254(1) {{represents}} {{the far more}} common route: certiorari, the source of nearly all the Supreme Court's current docket. Section 1254(2) represents a less common route: certification. Pursuant to § 1254(2), the Supreme Court heard 72 certified question cases between 1927 and 1936; 20 between 1937 and 1946; and only four between 1947 and 2010. In modern jurisprudence, § 1254(2) certification has become very rare. For example, when the en banc Fifth Circuit attempted to certify a question in 2009 (also a rare occurrence), the Supreme Court summarily declined to <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Certified questions are also governed by Supreme Court Rule 19.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. <b>Consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in which liquid crystal molecules are aligned {{parallel to the}} surface and an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.|$|E

25|$|The Governor-General acts on {{the advice}} of the Minister of Justice. The Governor-General has power to grant a pardon, to refer a person's case back to the court under section 406 of the Crimes Act 1961, and to reduce a person's sentence. If a person's case is {{referred}} back to the court, the court will <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in a similar way to hearing an appeal. The court then provides advice to the Governor-General as to how to act. Recently, David Bain was granted such an appeal to the Court of Appeal, which in turn was appealed to the Privy Council.|$|E

25|$|Appeals are {{by way of}} rehearing; {{in other}} words, the High Court is {{entitled}} to <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> afresh and is not bound in any way by the decision made by the court below. However, during an appeal, witnesses do not appear before the Court again to repeat their testimony. Instead, the Court refers to the notes taken by the judge who presided at the trial at first instance, or the full transcript of the proceedings if this is available. It also listens to legal arguments advanced by the parties' lawyers. During an appeal, the Court has the same powers as the Court of Appeal has when it hears appeals from the High Court.|$|E
25|$|Because the congrua {{are exactly}} the numbers that are four times the area of a Pythagorean triangle, and {{multiplication}} by four does not change whether a number is square, {{the existence of a}} square congruum is equivalent to the existence of a Pythagorean triangle with a square area. It is this variant of the problem that Fermat's proof concerns: he shows {{that there is no such}} triangle. In considering this problem, Fermat was inspired not by Fibonacci but by an edition of Diophantus published by Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac. This book described various special right triangles whose areas had forms related to squares, but did not <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of areas that were themselves square.|$|E
25|$|<b>Consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of an {{observer}} {{and a light}} source moving relative to each other at constant velocity, with a light beam moving from the source to the observer. At the moment of emission, the beam in the observer's rest frame is tilted compared {{to the one in}} the source's rest frame, as understood through relativistic beaming. During the time it takes the light beam to reach the observer the light source moves in the observer's frame, and the 'true position' of the light source is displaced relative to the apparent position the observer sees, as explained by light-time correction. Finally, the beam in the observer's frame at the moment of observation is tilted compared to the beam in source's frame, which can be understood as an aberrational effect. Thus, a person in the light source's frame would describe the apparent tilting of the beam in terms of aberration, while a person in the observer's frame would describe it as a light-time effect.|$|E

25|$|Entropy is {{a measure}} of unpredictability of the state, or equivalently, of its average {{information}} content. To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such polls happen because the outcome of the poll is not already known. In other words, the outcome of the poll is relatively unpredictable, and actually performing the poll and learning the results gives some new information; these are just different ways of saying that the a priori entropy of the poll results is large. Now, <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that the same poll is performed a second time shortly after the first poll. Since the result of the first poll is already known, the outcome of the second poll can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the a priori entropy of the second poll result is small relative to that of the first.|$|E
25|$|The {{constitutional}} principle {{is that a}} member of the Court Constitutional Court cannot be dismissed. Decisions to dismiss a Court members must be taken by the person or body (i.e. the President of the Republic or the National Assembly; in the latter case, by a majority vote {{of the total number of}} Deputies) having appointed the member in question. Where such a question has been raised, the Constitutional Court must <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in the member’s absence, and must issue a conclusion- on the termination of the member’s office by a majority of at least two thirds of the Court membership (i.e. 6 out of 9). Once the conclusion has been issued, the actual decision on the Constitutional Court member’s dismissal must be taken by the authority having appointed him or her (although in fact no member of the Constitutional Court has ever been dismissed since its inauguration). The independence of the members of the Constitutional Court is guaranteed by their submission to the Constitution and the Law on the Constitutional Court. It is prohibited to influence {{a member of the}} Constitutional Court, and anyone attempting to do so is liable to prosecution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{of using}} gold {{as the source}} (mp = 1063°C). In this technique, the current through the {{filament}} of the pyrometer is adjusted until the light intensity of the filament matches that of a black-body at the melting point of gold. This establishes the primary calibration temperature and can be {{expressed in terms of}} current through the pyrometer lamp. With the same current setting, the pyrometer is sighted on another black-body at a higher temperature. An absorbing medium of known transmission is inserted between the pyrometer and this black-body. The temperature of the black-body is then adjusted until a match exists between its intensity and that of the pyrometer filament. The true higher temperature of the black-body is then determined from Planck's Law. The absorbing medium is then removed and the current through the filament is adjusted to match the filament intensity to that of the black-body. This establishes a second calibration point for the pyrometer. This step is repeated to carry the calibration to higher temperatures. Now, temperatures and their corresponding pyrometer filament currents are known and a curve of temperature versus current can be drawn. This curve can then be extrapolated to very high temperatures.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the council}} {{probably}} ended on 1 April, Eugene asked {{a number of}} attendees to stay after the formal close of the council to <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Gilbert of Poitiers, who was under investigation for heresy, connected with his teachings. The main concern against Gilbert {{seems to have been}} his convoluted vocabulary and style of writing, which led to his writings being easily misunderstood. The specific problem came when Gilbert's writings attempted to explicate the relationship between God and his [...] "divinity", which led to his opponents claiming that Gilbert was attempting to create two Gods, rather than just one. His opponents claimed that this occurred in Gilbert's treatise on Boethius' theological work De Trinitate.|$|E

[...] "The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment stands," [...] he wrote, [...] "on its own bottom."

500|$|According to a {{spokesperson}} from HRW, Saudi Arabian {{law does not}} provide strong legal protection for migrant workers and housemaids.
