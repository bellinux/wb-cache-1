40|$|In the diploma I focused {{myself on}} the use of <b>computer</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> for solving the {{painting}} tasks in the 5 th grade of primary school. The theoretical part describes the peculiarities of art as educational process and the artistic expression of pupils in the second triad. Further on, certain art concepts and techniques of painting tasks in the fifth grade, as well as the objectives and standards of knowledge in arts are introduced. One way to realize the painting task is to use the <b>computer</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> for artistic expression. That is why the teacher has to master the computer programme that enables pupils to solve artistic tasks. With proper motivation, but also by incorporating the <b>computer</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> in the process of learning, pupils will be able to develop their own creativity. Theoretical knowledge was used in the process of planning and performance of three painting tasks that were carried out together with the pupils. In the empirical part of the diploma I wondered how often the computer was being used in teaching arts from the 1 st to the 5 th grade, in which part of the lessons the teachers include <b>computer</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> for using learning means, about the ability of pupils to use computer in painting, how teachers’ use of computers affects students' understanding of art concepts and particularities in art materials, how computer affects the motivation and autonomy of pupils in artistic expression and finally, how the computer affects the pupils' creativity in solving painting tasks. The findings obtained in diploma are the result of evaluation and observation scales, of a questionnaire that was filled out by the pupils and primary school teachers at three primary schools, as well as the results of my own work and observation. The analysis of lessons and the results of survey proved that primary school teachers used computers in art classes and that the usage of <b>computer</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> for solving painting tasks motivates pupils in order to support their creativity and autonomy at work. ...|$|R

He was an early and ardent proponent and user of <b>computers</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> for art making, {{dating back to the}} mid-1960s, when Alison Knowles and he created the first computer generated literary texts. His A Book About Love & War & Death, a book-length aleatory poem published in 1972 included one of those. In his introduction, Higgins says, having finished the first three parts of the poem throwing dice, he wrote a FORTRAN IV program to produce part (or Canto) four. Higgins also created 'metadrama ' poems 'minimal emotional statements or narratives'. Between 1976 and 1994 he collaborated with the Italian writer and visual artist Luciano Caruso (poet) through email correspondence.|$|E

50|$|Born in Rome, Italy, De Margheriti {{arrived in}} Canberra {{with his family}} in 1970. He experimented with CB radios and {{electronics}} early as a young teenager. When he was eleven De Margheriti experimented with making computer games independently. During his senior years at Hawker College, De Margheriti co-created an amateur 8 mm science fiction film after watching the 1977 film, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. During the development of his amateur film, he co-developed a robotics system that would enable him to film complex stop-motion animation footage of large scale spaceship models. De Margheriti's need to create scrolling film credits led him to discover <b>computers</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool.</b> The film involved dozens of actors and as a result, De Margheriti gained his first taste in management working with actors and prop builders. During filming he met Steve Wang which would later form the basis of a longstanding business association. He wrote his first computer game called “Maze” on a PDP-11 and his peer, Steve Wang developed a computer game called “Caves”, also on a PDP-11 computer.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, Kenya {{is home to}} an {{estimated}} 650,000 AIDS orphans. Particularly devastated are the communities along the shore of Lake Victoria in western Kenya, where Kageno operates its flagship project. Two-hundred AIDS orphans have been taken in through Kageno programs in Kenya, where Kageno also administers a voluntary counseling and testing centre (VCT) that provides access to anti-retroviral drugs for those who test positive for HIV/AIDS. In addition, Kageno holds an event on Rusinga Island each year on World AIDS Day that is attended by more than 200 local people. Kageno recently partnered with Intel Corporationto roll out an initiative that will train thousands of Kenyan students from rural areas {{on how to use}} <b>computers</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool</b> for learning. Kageno's recent partnership with Intel Corporation continues to show great progress and the students are making great strides as computer literacy becomes part of their everyday lives.Dubbed [...] "Computer on wheels", the Intel sponsored Rusinga Technology Classroom offered interactive e-learning programs to pupils in the Island. The program coordinator Arphaxad Nguka who also acted as the lead facilitator on the field ensured a free flow of the interactive learning sessions. This was made necessary by the periodic visits by volunteers from Intel education service corps. They provided capacity building on efficient management of the project. [...] The Intel's Rusinga technology classroom was a project of its kind. It acted as a pilot project for introduction of digital literacy and incorporating computers as part of primary education curriculum whereby subjects like mathematics and Science can be taught using the computer. The main aim for the initial phase was to get the pupils in the remote Island exposed to latest computing technology despite the limitations. later on the program would be incorporated into their learning curriculum plus internet connectivity provided to ensure interactions and sharing of learning resources. Hundreds of them accessed this program and gradually developed their computer literacy skills. This program proved to be a huge success more so when proper financing/resourcing, collaboration and selecting appropriate technology are maintained. It outlined an ambitious rural e-learning strategy capable of providing access to cutting edge computing technology to a large number of learners.|$|E

The following questions were formulated: How important is it to diagnose dyslectic students? How does the computer assistance motivates dyslectic students achieve their goals? How easy is it to include dyslectic students in the ordinary class with computer assistance? And in which way does the school and home environments affect dyslectic students who have Swedish <b>as</b> <b>a</b> second language? The sample consisted of four dyslectic students, 13 to 15 year olds who have Swedish <b>as</b> <b>a</b> second language. And two Swedish and Swedish as second language teachers.   They were selected by purposive non-probability sampling. They were all participating in the one to one programme. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews and analysed using content analysis. After transcribing the interviews’ six themes: diagnosis, <b>computer</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>tool,</b> inclusion, motivation and environment were identified. The results were that computers are helpful tools for dyslectic students who have Swedish <b>as</b> <b>a</b> second language. <b>Computer</b> assistance makes these students more independent to find ways to support themselves. They do not need to face failure all the time, when they can use the computer to achieve success. It motivates the students to learn more. It was very clear that the students were more efficient in computers compared to the teacher´s. Maybe, both the teachers and the students should be given the same competence education.
