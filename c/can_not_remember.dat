2500|$|Following the breakup, Christensen {{became more}} {{introverted}} than usual, {{and his girlfriend}} could not handle him being in this crisis. He went through a difficult time of coping with both his breakup with the band and with Rosendahl, but {{he went on to}} find his musical style, which resulted in the release of his debut solo album Secrets on Parade in 2000, of which some songs were based on the Dizzy Mizz Lizzy demos from 1998. Several songs on the album were rather ambiguous as to whether they referred to Dizzy Mizz Lizzy or Rosendahl. The album was a success, and it allowed him to further pursue a career in music. Nielsen and Friis initially also intended to continue in music, but turned to a normal working-class life. To walk off the extra weight he had gained from being at home for a long time, Nielsen {{took a job as a}} postman, while Friis became a truck driver delivering gas containers. Despite their different paths, Christensen explained in a 2000 interview that the trio remained friends: [...] "We meet occasionally and have great fun together. Of course we talk about the old days and amuse ourselves with it, because we experienced a lot of great things together and I simply <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> anything bad from back then. (...) But we just developed ourselves in three different directions, and we kept growing further apart, so it was simply the time to stop." ...|$|E

60|$|Another of {{the cabin}} inmates, was a middle-aged Londoner, in a comical Cockney-cut coat, {{with a pair of}} semicircular tails: so that {{he looked as if he}} were sitting in a swing. He wore a spotted neckerchief; a short, little, fiery-red vest; and striped pants, very thin in the calf, but very full about the waist. There was nothing describable about him but his dress; for he had such a {{meaningless}} face, I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> it; though I have a vague impression, that it looked at the time, as if its owner was laboring under the mumps.|$|E

50|$|The knew-it-all-along {{effect is}} {{a variant of the}} {{hindsight}} bias. It is the tendency for people to misremember and think that they knew more in the past than they actually did. In such situations it is difficult for us to {{remember what it was like}} when we did not have an understanding of something. For example, one might have a hard time teaching a concept to another individual because they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> what it is like to not understand the material.|$|E

To see the worst possible outcome of the surgery, the doctors agree to run a test. <b>Not</b> only <b>can</b> Izzie <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> the cards, she also can't remember who anybody is or even how to speak.

When the lovestruck Miles Laurence is {{determined}} to win Marty's heart, he takes extreme measures, stealing Marty's audiotaped [...] "confession" [...] from her therapist's office and blackmailing her with it, forcing Marty to marry him in order to retain custody of her son. Marty finally tells John McBain about her precarious situation, and John becomes determined to exonerate Marty, find Spencer's true murderer, and end Miles' sick game with Marty's life. Before John can learn the truth, however, the evidence against Marty becomes overwhelming, and she is arrested as the prime suspect in Truman's murder. John and Marty struggle to uncover the hazy details surrounding the night Spencer was killed, and eventually Marty remembers that she {{was never able to}} strike Spencer; instead, he assaulted her and left her in a vacant hospital room, leaving her with a head injury. Soon thereafter, John deduces that Lindsay Rappaport is the real murderer, and Marty is released from prison.|$|R

After the office finds out Stanley does have a mustache, they start cheering, to which Stanley just responds with a grunt.|$|R

I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> when I did not so think, and feel. ...

50|$|Hayward and Fellows became {{increasingly}} apprehensive, but after Smith lost his patience {{with them and}} made implied threats, they reluctantly agreed {{to go through with}} the trip.

So Fellows procured a false passport through a friend, {{in the name of a}} deceased child Gregory Hastings Barker. Smith later said that Fellows got done because he booked his flight using Smith's telephone, although Fellows says that he <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> whether he booked it with Smiths phone or not.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} topics in the area of economics of family and household is how changes in household technology have affected both household production—the production of goods and services by household members for consumption by household members—and market production—the production of goods and services by paid labor, meant for sale. These changes have also apparently led to profound changes in consumption patterns as well as changes in time use, including women's increased participation in market production. Less obviously, but even more profoundly, they have apparently led to significant changes in our most fundamental choices regarding who we live with and how we live.

There is a pleasant tract {{on the bank of}} the Concord, called Conantum, which I have in my mind;--the old deserted farm-house, the desolate pasture with its bleak cliff, the open wood, the river-reach, the green meadow in the midst, and the moss-grown wild-apple orchard,--places where one may have many thoughts and not decide anything. It is a scene which I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>remember,</b> as I might a vision, but when I will can bodily revisit, and find it even so, unaccountable, yet unpretending in its pleasant dreariness. When my thoughts are sensible of change, I love to see and sit on rocks which I have known, and pry into their moss, and see unchangeableness so established.

60|$|Notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops {{the date}} of the {{foundation}} of Vondervotteimittis, and the derivation of its name, there can be no doubt, as I said before, that it has always existed as we find it at this epoch. The oldest man in the borough <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>not</b> the slightest difference in the appearance of any portion of it; and, indeed, the very suggestion of such a possibility is considered an insult. The site of the village is in a perfectly circular valley, {{about a quarter of a}} mile in circumference, and entirely surrounded by gentle hills, over whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass. For this they assign the very good reason that they do not believe there is anything at all on the other side.|$|R
