40|$|ABSTRACT Using a tunable titanium-sapphire laser, we have {{compared}} different wavelengths (from 700 to 840 nm) for their utility in optical trapping of chromosomes in mitotic rat kangaroo Potorous tridactylus (PtK 2) cells. It {{was found that}} irradiation with a near-infrared light induces the sticking together of chromosome shoulders. The attached chromatids failed to separate, or separated with significant delay and formed a <b>chromosome</b> <b>bridge</b> during anaphase. Using this bridge (and induced c-mitosis) as a reference, we compared the action of different wavelengths (from 700 to 840 nm). Chromosomes were irradiated at metaphase and the cells were observed {{until the end of}} cytokinesis. Chromosomes were irradiated for different periods of time, using 130 mW of power at the objective focal plane. The biological responses observed after optical trapping were: (1) normal cell division, (2) formation of a temporary <b>chromosome</b> <b>bridge,</b> (3) formation of a permanent <b>chromosome</b> <b>bridge,</b> (4) complete blockage of chromosome separation (c-mitosis). The chromosomes were found to have a maximal sensitivity to 760 - 765 nm light and minimal sensitivity to 700 and 800 - 820 nm light. Cells with chromosomes irradiated for a long time, using wavelength 760 - 765 nm, generally were incapable of going through anaphase and remained in c-mitosis. We conclude that the optimal wavelengths for optical trapping are 700 and 800 - 820 nm...|$|E
40|$|An {{increase}} in Src activity is commonly observed in epithelial cancers. Aberrant {{activation of the}} kinase activity is associated with malignant progression. However, the mechanisms that underlie the Src-induced malignant progression of cancer are not completely understood. We show here that v-Src, an oncogene that was first identified from a Rous sarcoma virus and a mutant variant of c-Src, leads to an {{increase in}} the number of anaphase and telophase cells having chromosome bridges. v-Src increases the number of γH 2 AX foci, and this increase is inhibited by treatment with PP 2, a Src kinase inhibitor. v-Src induces the phosphorylation of KAP 1 at Ser 824, Chk 2 at Thr 68, and Chk 1 at Ser 345, suggesting the activation of the ATM/ATR pathway. Caffeine decreases the number of cells having chromosome bridges at a concentration incapable of inhibiting Chk 1 phosphorylation at Ser 345. These results suggest that v-Src induces chromosome bridges via generation of DNA damage and the subsequent DNA damage response, possibly by homologous recombination. A <b>chromosome</b> <b>bridge</b> gives rise to the accumulation of DNA damage directly through chromosome breakage and indirectly through cytokinesis failure-induced multinucleation. We propose that v-Src-induced <b>chromosome</b> <b>bridge</b> formation is one of the causes of the v-Src-induced malignant progression of cancer cells...|$|E

40|$|The condensin {{complex is}} a key {{determinant}} of mitotic chromosome architecture. In addition to its role in mitotic chromosome compaction, condensin is required for resolution of sister chromatid linkages during chromosome segregation in anaphase. How condensin resolves sister chromatids, {{and the nature of}} the <b>chromosome</b> <b>bridges</b> that are characteristic of cells harboring defective condensin, have remained topics of debate. Inactivation of topoisomerase II, the main enzyme that removes topological interlinks that persist between DNA replication products after their synthesis, leads to similar <b>chromosome</b> <b>bridges.</b> Here, we follow the catenation status of circular minichromosomes of three sizes during the S. cerevisiae cell cycle. Catenanes are produced in S-phase and, in part, they are readily resolved, aided by physical separation of sister chromatids during mitosis. Complete resolution, however, requires the condensin complex, a dependency that becomes more pronounced with increasing chromosome size. Condensin and topoisomerase II directly interact and, using purified proteins, we show that condensin stimulates DNA decatenation by topoisomerase II in vitro. Therefore, in parallel to promoting chromosome condensation, condensin facilitates topological resolution of sister chromatids to secure their successful segregation to daughter cells during cell division...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the reasons for pollen sterility in lily hybrids, four diploid sterile Oriental x Trumpet (OT) lily cultivars ('Nymph', 'Gluhwein', 'Yelloween', and 'Shocking') were used to investigate the meiotic chromosome behaviors in pollen mother cells (PMCs), using genomic in situ hybridization and conventional cytological methods. At metaphase I, chromosome associations were quite variable, not only among different genotypes but also in different PMCs of the same genotype. In addition to bivalents, a certain amount of univalent, trivalents, and quadrivalents were observed in all of the investigated genotypes. In addition, ring octavalents and ring hexavalents were observed in 'Nymph'. Even dodecavalents were observed in 'Nymph'. These abnormal chromosome associations at metaphase I implied the occurrence of chromosome interchanges (translocation) in these intersectional hybrids. At anaphase-telophase, a large number of laggard chromosomes and different kinds of <b>chromosome</b> <b>bridge</b> configurations were observed. At the tetrad stage, micronuclei and polyads were also found in many PMCs. All of these abnormal chromosome behaviors in PMCs were responsible for the pollen sterility in lily hybrids...|$|E

The expression levels of human MAD 1 β were examined in hepatoma cell lines and human HCC samples. The functional roles of MAD 1 β {{in relation to the}} mitotic checkpoint control, chromosomal instability, and binding with MAD 2 were assessed in hepatoma cell lines. On sequencing, MAD 1 β was found to have deletion of exon 4. It was expressed at both mRNA and protein levels in the nine hepatoma cell lines tested and was overexpressed in 12 of 50 (24 %) human HCCs. MAD 1 β localized in the cytoplasm, whereas MAD 1 α was found in the nucleus. This cytoplasmic localization of MAD 1 β was due to the absence of a nuclear localization signal in MAD 1 α. In addition, MAD 1 β was found to physically interact with MAD 2 and sequester it in the cytoplasm.

40|$|Accurate {{chromosome}} segregation during cell division {{is essential to}} maintain genome stability, and {{chromosome segregation}} errors are causally linked to genetic disorders and cancer. An anaphase <b>chromosome</b> <b>bridge</b> is a particular chromosome segregation error observed in cells that enter mitosis with fused chromosomes/sister chromatids. The widely accepted Breakage/Fusion/Bridge cycle model proposes that anaphase chromosome bridges break during mitosis to generate chromosome ends that will fuse during the following cell cycle, thus forming new bridges that will break, and so on. However, various studies have also shown a link between chromosome bridges and aneuploidy and/or polyploidy. In this study, we investigated the behavior and properties of chromosome bridges during mitosis, with the idea to gain insight into the potential mechanism underlying chromosome bridge-induced aneuploidy. We find {{that only a small}} number of chromosome bridges break during anaphase, whereas the rest persist through mitosis into the subsequent cell cycle. We also find that the microtubule bundles (k-fibers) bound to bridge kinetochores are not prone to breakage/detachment, thus supporting the conclusion that k-fiber detachment is not the cause of chromosome bridge-induced aneuploidy. Instead, our data suggest that while the microtubules bound to the kinetochores of normally segregating chromosomes shorten substantially during anaphase, the k-fibers bound to bridge kinetochores shorten only slightly, and may even lengthen, during anaphase. This causes some of the bridge kinetochores/chromosomes to lag behind in a position that is proximal to the cell/spindle equator and may cause the bridged chromosomes to be segregated into the same daughter nucleus or to form a micronucleus...|$|E

Cytogenotoxic potentials of green synthesized Cola pod (Cp-AgNPs), seed (Cs-AgNPs) and seed shell (Css-AgNPs) silver nanoparticles and silver nitrate salts (Ags) were evaluated using an A. cepa assay. Twenty onion bulbs were exposed to 0. 01, 0. 10, 1. 0, 10. 0, and 100. 0 Â Î¼g/ml AgNPs and Ags solutions. Microscopic evaluation was performed at 24, 48 and 72 Â h with 5000 cells per concentration scored for chromosomal aberrations, while the effects on the root growth were evaluated at 72 Â h. The observed dividing cells and mitotic inhibition were dose-dependent for the three AgNPs and Ags at 24, 48 and 72 Â h. Mitotic index obtained for 1. 0, 10 and 100 Â Î¼g/mL at all times of evaluation were less than half the value of the negative control, while cell arrest was only observed at 72 Â h at a concentration of 100 Â Î¼g/mL for the three AgNPs. The chromosomal aberrations observed were c-mitosis, a <b>chromosome</b> <b>bridge,</b> a vagrant chromosome, and a sticky chromosome, which indicate the potential of AgNPs for genotoxicity. The mean root length of A. cepa treated with AgNPs showed a dose-dependent significant decrease compared to the control, indicating their inhibitory potential, but the mean root lengths were found to be lower at all concentrations compared to those treated with Ags, thus showing the attenuation of growth inhibition. The EC 50 values revealed the order of growth inhibition as Ags>Cp-AgNPs>Css-AgNPs>Cs-AgNPs. The cytogenotoxic potential of the AgNPs suggests that caution should be exercised in their usage to prevent environmental pollution.

40|$|Telomeres are {{nucleoprotein}} complexes {{that protect}} {{the ends of}} linear chromosomes and are required {{for a wide range}} of cellular processes, as apoptosis, aging, cancer and chromosome stability. Telomere shortens every time a somatic human cell divides. Furthermore human cancers, avoid the progressive loss of telomeric DNA by the telomerase or the telomerase-independent mechanism, termed ALT (Alternative Telomere Lengthening), result into indefinite cell proliferation. However, it has been demonstrated, that several physical or chemical agents are able to modulate telomere length; in particular oxidative stress accelerates telomere shortening. Literature data showed that telomeres are the preferential target for oxidative damage because of ROS able to induce 8 -oxodG from triplet GGG present in human telomeric sequence TTAGGG. Nevertheless, the effects of prolonged oxidative stress on telomere metabolism are still poorly investigated. With the aim to investigate the effects of oxidative stress on telomere length and chromosome segregation and to test mitotic defects, human primary lung fibroblasts (MRC- 5) were daily treated with 10 μM H 2 O 2 and analysed at regular intervals over period of 94 days. The telomere length analysed by Q-FISH (Quantitative-FISH), showed a telomere shortening at 9 - 21 days, and a telomere elongation between 21 - 48 days. Moreover we observed that this trend of “shortening-lengthening” was repeated on time up to 94 days. Based on this repeated trend, we focused our attention to the first 45 days, because at longer time several mechanisms, as senescence, not straight related to oxidative stress effects, could interfere with the results. At this interval of time, we saw a significant telomere shortening after 5 days and a telomere elongation at 15 days of treatment. Based on these results, we confirm that prolonged oxidative stress is responsible of telomere shortening even at low daily doses. Considering that telomere shortening could have an effect on cell viability, first of all, we analysed other endpoints: a) Possible cell cycle perturbation by Cytofluorimetric analysis. We noticed any differences between treated and own control samples. b) The entity of DNA damage induced by prolonged treatment with H 2 O 2 by “Alkaline Comet Assay”. Moreover we used Trypan Blue Assay to evaluate cell viability and this analysis has relieved in all cases that cell death was less than 30 %, value above which the mortality is considered significant. c) To understand if the DNA damage and telomere shortening observed could induce premature senescence, we assessed the number of β- galattosidase positive cells, typically expresses in senescence cells. As expected, we observed a light trend of senescence on time in treated and control samples, with a difference between the two only at 10 - 15 and 20 - 27 days. This led us to conclude that oxidative stress did not induce significant premature senescence in treated cells. Considering that telomere shortening did not alter cell viability, we studied the mechanism responsible of telomere elongation observed at 15 days. To evaluate this mechanism the analysis of telomerase activity was performed by RTQ-TRAP assay that showed no telomerase activation for all fixation times. On the other hand, to verify ALT activation, we assessed two ALT markers: telomeric-sister chromatid exchanges (T-SCE) by CO-FISH analysis and colocalization of telomeres-PML proteins by FISH and immunostainig. We showed a higher frequency of both these ALT markers at 15 days of treatment, corresponding to the time of telomere elongation observed. This led us to hypothesize Human Primary Fibroblast could activate ALT mechanism, known in literature be present in a little percentage of tumor cells. However we cannot exclude the presence of a cellular selection system that promotes cells with longer telomeres due their major viability. In literature is known that telomere shortening could alter chromosomes segregation by inducing chromosome bridges (end-to-end fusion). To analyse the relation between telomere length and chromosome segregation defects, like chromosome bridges, during my period at the Virginia Tech University we performed Time lapse on live cells and immunostainig (that detect Kinetochore and mitotic spindle) in mitotic cells in the range of 1 - 48 days. Data obtained were pulled and showed an increase of chromosome bridges in treated cells at 5, 27, 41 and 48 days of treatment. The induction of chromosome bridges at 5 days indicated a relation between telomere shortening and chromosome segregation defects. Moreover the reduction of chromosome bridges, observed at 15 days, was related to telomere lengthening saw at the same day. Based on these results, we could observe that telomere shortening induced by oxidative stress at 5 days of treatment could triggers the increase of chromosome bridges induction. Subsequently, we observed a chromosome bridges decrease corresponding to the time of telomere elongation and based on previous results obtained, we hypothesized that ALT mechanism restores telomere length inducing a reduction of chromosome segregation defects related to telomere shortening. In fact, according to literature data, the loss of chromosome ends could result in “sticky” chromosomes that will give rise to dicentric/ring chromosomes: when these dicentric/ring chromosomes will try to separate in anaphase, they will create a <b>chromosome</b> <b>bridge</b> that breaks before or in transition to telophase. Then, the breakage of bridge will create new sticky chromosome ends that could fuse with other sticky ends or that could determine the sister chromatid fusion at the following cell cycle, creating the so called “breakage/fusion/bridge cycle” (BFB). This BFB cycle will continue until the affected chromosome will acquire a new telomere, as in our case when ALT mechanism restores the telomere length. To further assess the effects of telomere length changes on chromosome instability, we evaluated abnormal nuclear structures at 1 - 20 days. We estimated the quantity of NBPs (nucleoplasmic bridge) and NBuds (nuclear Buds), markers of chromosome segregation defects, measuring a significant increase of these biomarkers at 5 days of treatment and confirming previous result obtained for chromosome bridges. These data have been supported by anaphase-lagging chromosomes, marker of chromosome loss. In both fixed- and live-cells. We observed an increase in anaphase lagging chromosomes frequencies over the control at 5, 20, 27 and 41 days of treatment. Additionally, kinetochore positive micronuclei (MN) were analysed by immunostainig. Kinetochore positive MN represents a marker of chromosome loss and aneuploidy (Fenech, M. and Morley, A. A. 1985). Our analysis resulted in a significant increase of kinetochore positive MN in almost all-fixing time. With the aim to evaluate if also other mitotic defects, in addition to chromosome segregation defects, were induced by prolonged oxidative stress, cells with tilted mitotic spindles, defined as the positioning of the spindle long axis at an angle instead of parallel to the substrate, were observed. We observed frequencies of tilted spindles above the control frequencies during the first 10 days, at 27, and 48 days of treatment. These results indicated that prolonged oxidative stress affected spindle structure and/or function. Thus, in addition to the telomeric damage, which causes chromosome rearrangements and can result in chromosome bridges in mitosis, prolonged oxidative stress could also induce telomere-independent mitotic defects, such as MN, lagging chromosomes, which can result in aneuploidy, and cells with tilted spindle. Taken together, these data indicated that prolonged oxidative stress could cause the two most common karyotype defects observed in cancer cells: chromosome rearrangements and aneuploidy...|$|E

The present study addressed the effects of ionic Cu (2. 0 mMand 8. 0 mM) on mitosis, the microtubule cytoskeleton,and DNA in root tip cells of Allium cepa var. agrogarum L. to better understand Cu toxicity on plant root systems. The results indicated that Cu accumulated in roots and that root growth was inhibited dramatically in Cu treatment groups. Chromosomal aberrations (for example, C-mitosis, <b>chromosome</b> <b>bridges,</b> <b>chromosome</b> stickiness, and micronucleus) were observed, and the mitotic index decreased during Cu treatments at different concentrations. Microtubules were one of the target sites of Cu toxicity in root tip meristematic cells, and Cu exposure substantially impaired microtubule arrangements. The content of a-tubulin decreased following 36 h of exposure to 2. 0 mM or 8. 0 mM of Cu in comparison with the control group. Copper increased DNA damage and suppressed cell cycle progression. The above toxic effects became more serious with increasing Cu concentration and prolonged exposure time...|$|R
