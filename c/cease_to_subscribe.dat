[...] "This," [...] he said, [...] "is their gratitude"; {{and from that}} day he <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> the local {{charities}} or take his walks in the village. He had given the institute, and so could not pull it down nor prevent them from using it.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{advocates of}} these approaches, by analogy to {{software}} code, {{argue for a}} [...] "central codebase" [...] {{in the form of}} a set of policies that are maintained in a public registry and that are infinitely reproducible. [...] "Distributions" [...] of this policy-base are released (periodically or dynamically) for use in localities, which can apply [...] "patches" [...] to customize them for their own use. Localities are also able <b>to</b> <b>cease</b> <b>subscribing</b> <b>to</b> the central policy-base and [...] "fork" [...] it or adopt someone else's policy-base. In effect, the government stems from emergent cooperation and self-correction among members of a community. As the policies are put into practice in a number of localities, problems and issues are identified and solved, and where appropriate communicated back to the core.|$|R
50|$|One {{aspect of}} Brahmoism is {{recognition}} {{that not only}} explicit faith and worship makes for a Brahmo, but also genealogy, which is implicit. People with even a single Brahmo parent or a Brahmo guardian are treated as Brahmos until they absolutely renounce the Brahmo faith. This often causes tension within the Samaj, for example, when an offspring of a Brahmo follows communism or atheism or another religious belief without renouncing Brahmoism formally. There are differing views between the Theist and Deist streams of Brahmoism on the retention of such people within the fold. Additionally, a Brahmo who opts not <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> membership of a Brahmo Samaj remains a Brahmo but <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> be a Brahmo Samajist.|$|R

People were instead {{encouraged}} <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> Collins' [...] "National Loan", set up {{to raise funds for}} the young government and its army. By {{the end of the year}} the loan had reached £358,000. It eventually reached £380,000. An even larger amount, totalling over $5 million, was raised in the United States by Irish Americans and sent to Ireland to finance the Republic. Rates were still paid to local councils but nine out of eleven of these were controlled by Sinn Féin, who naturally refused to pass them on to the British government. By mid-1920, the Irish Republic was a reality in the lives of many people, enforcing its own law, maintaining its own armed forces and collecting its own taxes. The British Liberal journal, The Nation, wrote in August 1920 that [...] "the central fact of the present situation in Ireland is that the Irish Republic exists".|$|R
