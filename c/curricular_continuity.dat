40|$|A {{significant}} number of reasoned and documented projections indicate that two-year associate degree-granting institutions will play an increasing role {{in the preparation of}} students who continue and obtain baccalaureate degrees. The U. S. population is growing, but few new institutions are being built. Many individuals must obtain their collegiate education close to home. Economic pressures and credit-hour caps are focusing states and localities on articulation agreements and <b>curricular</b> <b>continuity.</b> This session will explore these issues as a basis for presenting and considering what administrators should know and think about as local decision-making occurs...|$|E
40|$|El problema central que se aborda es la existencia o no de continuidad entre el currículo de la educación secundaria y el nivel de exigencia de la educación terciaria o superior. Para estudiarlo, se presenta un estudio que contempló al análisis del Marco Curricular de la Enseñanza Media (2005) y un cuestionario aplicado a estudiantes de primer año de universidad. Los resultados arrojan que sí existe una continuidad curricular entre ambos niveles educacionales, aun cuando hay algunas dimensiones (como Habilidades del aprendizaje y sus subcategorías) que presentan una ruptura parcial. La conclusión apunta a la {{necesidad}} de articular más estrechamente ambos currículos, para evitar la reprobación y la deserción en los primeros años universitarios. The central problem faced is {{the existence}} of a continuity between the curriculum of secondary education and the level of requirements of the higher education. In order to study this issue, it is presented a study which involved the analysis of the Curriculum Framework of High School (2005) and a questionnaire made to students in their first year of university. Results showed that there is a <b>curricular</b> <b>continuity</b> between the two educational levels, although there are some dimensions (such as learning skills and their subcategories) having a partial rupture. The conclusion suggests a need of connecting both kind of curricula in order to avoid fail a course and leave early the university...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the current {{preschool}} curricular and its implications for a broad based national preschool curriculum. The study was guided by five objectives namely to: examine the types of existing preschool curricular; their content; the strength and weaknesses; problems inherent in the curricular and the link between preschool activities and the primary one curricular. The study was conducted in Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar preschools. The sample comprised of 51 respondents including the Director of Primary Education in the Ministry of Education, the Director of Nursery, Primary and Middle Schools in Zanzibar, Curriculum Developers, Inspectors, heads of schools and teachers. The data was collected through documentary analysis, interviews, questionnaires, a checklist and observation. The findings indicated that there were nine types of curricular based on ownership. These comprised those prepared by the Ministry of Education Zanzibar, the Aga Khan, the Tanzania People's Defence Forces, Parents Committees, Religious groups and various individuals. There were basically two types of curricular - the professional and non professional developed curricular. The professional curricular included those developed by the Department of Educational Research and Curriculum Development, the Montessori and the Aga Khan. The academic activities and skills taught by the majority of preschool curricular were reading, writing and counting while non academic activities were religion, general science and plays. Some of the schools used primary one syllabuses, therefore their activities were not strongly based on early childhood principles and structure. The varying nature of the curricular created one of the problems while the other problem was attributed by shortage of materials and facilities. Some of the recommendations from the study included the need for the government to ensure that preschool curricular were developed professionally; that teachers should competently be trained on how to handle both normal and handicapped children; that means of raising funds be devised to support preschools; and that Curriculum Developers should design preschool curricular along broad principles of child development, care, and education so as to have continuity to early primary one; and finally, that there should be a systematic linkage between preschool activities and those in primary one <b>curricular</b> to ensure <b>continuity</b> in the academic proces...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the concept of {{educational}} guidance {{in the view of the}} structural and <b>curricular</b> <b>continuity</b> of the training course. First, we define the pedagogical meaning of school guidance, and in particular to its educational function. We have as work hypothesis the concept of guidance as a process that affects not only the transition moments, but also the entire training process and the entire life span. This conception meets the need of every individual to be able to face the new social emergencies related to the acceleration of technological change, labor mobility, the pervasiveness of knowledge in the individual and collective life. In an ever-changing society, in fact, it is essential to know how to deal with transitions, whether at school or work. Subsequently we interpret the orientation in the light of the notion of competence, with particular reference to those skills that we can define "guidance". Knowing how to manage their training history implies not only be the recipients of a guidance action, but know how to direct themselves. The school system contributes to the development of the self-orientation skills both implicitly and explicitly: through the exercise of its function of training and guidance through intentional actions aimed to record directly onto the continuation of individual training. Finally, in the light of the most common guidance practices in our country we present the fallout of a competence-oriented perspective on educational cycles discontinuity. In this context, particular importance is given to the processes of axiologization for the selection of essential knowledge and teaching intermediation to build learning situations able to promote guidance skills...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{is a school}} effectiveness study dealing with stakeholders' perceptions. It addresses six-year high school effectiveness, as it is perceived by key stakeholders in Israel: school principals, teachers, students, and parents. Stakeholders were asked to consider their attitudes towards characteristics that cause them to be satisfied or dissatisfied with the school. The research was undertaken during 2000 - 2001 in three Israeli six-year high schools. The six-year high school is {{a new kind of}} institute in Israel and it does not exist all over the country. This kind of school has two main components - a three-year junior high school and a three-year secondary school. In places having no six-year high schools, there are four-year secondary schools. The study includes three main research questions relating to the perceived characteristics of an ideal Israeli six-year high school, the perceived effectiveness of stakeholders' schools and the satisfaction they have with their own schools. The {{research is}} based on three case studies including a survey and interviews. 2 principals and 12 teachers in each school were interviewed (42 interviewees overall) whereas students and their parents were given questionnaires. One of the main things examined was the extent to which this new kind of school enables greater academic and <b>curricular</b> <b>continuity.</b> The study reveals that according to staffs attitudes, six-year continuity does not exist in all schools and there are institutions {{in which there is no}} integration between the junior high school and the secondary school. Furthermore, according to stakeholders' perceptions, six-year high schools are ineffective concerning teachers' quality, class size (classes are too crowded), resources management, students' motivation and parental involvement. The school principal has a direct and indirect influence on most characteristics and therefore schools managed by better principals are likely to be more effective. Nevertheless, lack of resources might limit the principal's impact on the whole six-year high school's effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|Master of EducationPrimary and {{secondary}} educational reforms seeking quality and accountability are placing top-down pressure on {{early childhood education}} to become more defined and assessable in preparation for future learning. State and Federal government policies advocate set curriculum with definable results. Such trends are also observed overseas. The aim is for early childhood education to be more relevant {{to the rest of}} the child's learning and to the demands of the time. A large body of professionals within early childhood education view this as an intrusive, restrictive and regressive approach which is inconsistent with what years of research have taught us about early childhood education. They maintain that early childhood education is a stage in its own right and does not need to be altered to match another. Their main view is that each child learns individually to full potential via firsthand experiences through play under the guidance of a qualified educarer. Frameworks, and <b>curricular</b> <b>continuity</b> are seen as restrictions of such freedom. Generally accepting this premise, the study seeks to investigate the viability of concepts that will provide quality, continuity and smooth transition from pre-prep education to primary school while remaining true to a free early childhood educational philosophy. Theories of prominent educators, psychologists and sociologists, current overseas research and practise, as well as guidelines contained in developmentally appropriate publications, were used as foundations and substantiations for the concept of a structured learning component through which social skills, cognitive skills and internalised learning are developed. This is seen to enable the incorporation of continuity of learning into early schooling and beyond. Play remains the medium of the child's learning experiences. The research established that a structured learning component can be valuable provided it is carried out by experienced professionals. A survey of community opinion indicated that such a component can be beneficial to future learning. Literature across the ideological continuum as surveyed, and most authors advocated the need for some structure in the early childhood curriculum. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
