5|$|On {{designing}} the battle system, Kitao {{said that his}} two main aims were <b>creating</b> <b>something</b> never before seen in an RPG and designing something accessible yet challenging. Adjustments to the battle system went on all through development, with some changes being made {{at the very last}} minute. The gun customization system was originally a puzzle-based system, but was later converted to a diagram set-up. Weapons were originally going to be represented in three-dimensions, but technical issues prevented this. On the whole, the development was a taxing one for him. The most difficult part about incorporating guns into the system was creating a workable system that did not rely on first-person and third-person shooter mechanics. The two types of damage and various special moves in the game were born from the team's discussions about how the three playable characters might be directed to work in unison, dealing different types of attacks. Being able to attack while moving was inspired by a suggestion from staff members stemming from more traditional action games and scenes from Hollywood action films. For the camera, the team decided to balance it between limited control during player turns and a more dynamic feel during attacks.|$|E
5|$|Soejima's {{first major}} {{work for the}} series was working on side {{characters}} for Persona 2 alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima {{in charge of the}} series' art direction after Persona 2 as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the Persona series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the Persona series, approaching character designs with the idea of <b>creating</b> <b>something</b> new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person in mind. For his work on Persona Q, his first time working with a deformed Chibi style due to its links with the Etrian Odyssey series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.|$|E
25|$|The {{saturation}} of Dragon Quest IX in Japan {{had increased}} the number of Passing-By Connections because the number of people carrying a DS on them outside home increased.

25|$|Mexican {{handcrafted}} {{toys are}} mostly miniature representations {{of things in}} life, such as birds, furniture, mermaids, bullfighting scenes, carts and much more, made with materials on hand such as bulrush, wood, cloth, clay and lead. They were mostly made for children of the Mexican underclasses. They are considered artistic not because of originality but rather the ingenuity of <b>creating</b> <b>something</b> special from practically nothing. These toys, most of which that survive are from the 19th and early 20th century are increasingly valued by collectors but are in disdain among the general Mexican populace. Since the 1950s, with the influence of movies and television, most children stopped wanting these types of toys for mass products produced abroad and {{based on what they}} see in media. Most toys sold to tourists now are cheaply made imitations {{of what used to be}} common.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{development}} team {{was new to}} 3D games, assistant director Makoto Miyanaga recalls a sense of [...] "passion for <b>creating</b> <b>something</b> new and unprecedented". A [...] "medieval tale of sword and sorcery," [...] Miyamoto intended the game {{to be in the}} chanbara genre of Japanese sword fighting. The development crew involved more than 120 people, including stunt performers used to capture the effects of sword fighting and Link's movement. Some of Miyamoto's ideas for the new Zelda title were instead used in Super Mario 64, since it was to be released first. Other ideas were not used due to time constraints.|$|E

500|$|For {{the closing}} reveal {{involving}} Melisandre, {{the director of}} the episode stated that a similar technique to the body double of Cersei Lannister in [...] "Mother's Mercy" [...] was used, with Carice van Houten wearing prosthetic makeup for the face that was then transposed onto the real body of an old woman. Podeswa stated, [...] "The idea is there's an indefinite indeterminate quality that she could be ancient. We were limited by choosing to use a real person rather than a complete [...] creation. Because what does a 400-year-old person look like? We don't know. So if you try to create that, then you're <b>creating</b> <b>something</b> that looks beyond our known reality. Here you feel like she's very old without putting a number on it." ...|$|E

500|$|The game's {{dark and}} supernatural yet cartoonish art style was {{influenced}} by the work of filmmaker Tim Burton, to which it has been frequently compared, and by writers Edward Gorey and H.P. Lovecraft. Forbes noted the team's ambition of <b>creating</b> <b>something</b> [...] "dark and creepy." [...] After conception of the basic game setup, Forbes penned a backstory influenced by steampunk and horror, and lead creative director Jeff Agala added comic strip-like art elements. To further the game's atmosphere of loneliness and directionlessness, Klei decided firmly against multiplayer gameplay. However, in December 2014, after numerous requests, Klei finally released the multiplayer version of the game titled [...] "Don't Starve Together" [...] on steam early access after an initial closed beta release.|$|E
500|$|The Castle Doctrine {{was created}} by indie {{developer}} Jason Rohrer; its ideas were drawn from Rohrer's childhood anxieties about his family's house being burgled, and his adult sense of responsibility over protecting his family. [...] The game's central theme is the castle doctrine and includes the issue of gun rights; Rohrer created it partially as an [...] "artistic statement" [...] on defending one's family through violence. He summarized his goals with the game as <b>creating</b> <b>something</b> [...] "that makes you feel violated and {{makes you want to}} protect stuff thatâ€™s yours, and puts you in the process of securing whatâ€™s yours." [...] However, he has remarked that the consequence of making players feel hypocriticalâ€”since they are invading others' homes as wellâ€”was partially intentional and an [...] "elegant" [...] idea.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, {{the team}} had {{released}} Fuse, which was a critical and commercial failure. The team now reflected on the reasons for its poor reception, and felt that they {{should go back to}} Insomniac's roots â€” developing unusual titles with vibrant visuals â€” instead of another dark shooter like Fuse. They also thought that Sunset Overdrives stylization should reflect the personality of the company, and that building a world that has a sense of humor and irreverence was something the team was eager to do. Ted Price, CEO of Insomniac Games, described it as a game Insomniac had wanted to develop for a long time. The game's producer, Bryan Intihar, called it: [...] "...the game [...] been meaning to make for 20 years." [...] Microsoft supported it and shared the same vision and the idea of <b>creating</b> <b>something</b> new.|$|E

500|$|Dragons of Autumn Twilight is a 1984 fantasy {{novel by}} Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, {{based on a}} series of Dungeons & Dragons (D) game modules. [...] It was the first Dragonlance novel, and first in the Chronicles trilogy, which, along with the Dragonlance Legends trilogy, are {{generally}} regarded as the core novels of the Dragonlance world. [...] The Chronicles trilogy came about because the designers wanted novels {{to tell the story of}} the game world they were <b>creating,</b> <b>something</b> to which TSR, Inc. (TSR) agreed only reluctantly. [...] Dragons of Autumn Twilight details the meeting of the Companions and the early days of The War of the Lance. [...] This novel corresponds with the first two Dragonlance game modules, Dragons of Despair and Dragons of Flame, but with a different ending. The novel introduces many of the characters that are the subject of other novels and short stories.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy VIII Original Soundtrack {{has sold}} [...] "more than 300,000 copies" [...] in Japan {{according}} to Square, or 259,000 physical copies {{according to the}} independent chart company Oricon. Adam Corn of SoundtrackCentral.com claimed the album shows similarities to previous Final Fantasy games, but asserted he was [...] "not overly impressed with this one". A reviewer from Square Enix Music Online claimed the soundtrack is [...] "unique and very special" [...] due to its contrastsâ€”"When signs of age of the Final Fantasy franchise are shown", Uematsu counterbalances this by <b>creating</b> <b>something</b> [...] "weird and wonderful when the soundtrack becomes too serious, a light-hearted number is inserted to liven up the mood". Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan said in his review of the album that [...] "the main flavor of Uematsu's compositions, his melodic style, remains consistent, and more importantly, consistently good". He criticized, however, the more minimalist pieces, which in his opinion were bland.|$|E
500|$|Marvel {{has been}} working with screenwriter John Ridley since mid-April 2015 to craft a new {{television}} series, [...] "reinventing" [...] an existing Marvel character or property. In January 2016, Ridley confirmed that the project was [...] "still in development". He stated that he was looking to [...] "bring some of the socially conscious nature" [...] of Jessica Jones and his series American Crime to the show, while also <b>creating</b> <b>something</b> that is [...] "straight entertainment". A year later, Channing Dungey revealed that Ridley's project was still progressing, with Ridley working on a rewrite of his script. Ridley added that the rewrite was not because [...] "anything didn't work the first time around", but rather trying to make sure the series does something viewers have not necessarily seen before in a superhero television series, hoping it would occupy [...] "a space that is not currently being filled" [...] by Marvel. He also stated that he hoped to create the series [...] "in the near term." [...] By August 2017, Dungey was [...] "not sure" [...] if Ridley was still working on the project.|$|E

500|$|Development on Episode II took {{approximately}} two years, worked on by {{a staff of}} 60 to 100 people. The staff was divided into three teams; [...] "scene", [...] "battle" [...] and [...] "quest". During production, Hagiwara and the other new staff aimed to turn Xenosaga into an evolving series rather than a static one. The gameplay was mainly carried over from Episode I, but with adjustments and additions designed to streamline the system and increase playability. The battle system was adjusted based on feedback that the first game's battle system was too complicated. The art director for the game was Norihiro Takami. While the character designs of Episode I were stylized, the cast were redesigned for Episode II to appear much more realistic. This was done to increase the expressiveness of the characters during cutscenes. The graphics engine was completely rebuilt for the second game. The new E.S. mecha were designed by Kouichi Mugitani and Junya Ishigaki; each wanted to emulate the design choices of Episode I while also <b>creating</b> <b>something</b> unique to Episode II. Mugitani also resumed his role from Episode I as production designer.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's guitar {{work with}} the Beatles was varied and flexible; {{although}} not fast or flashy, his lead guitar playing was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 1960s; his rhythm guitar playing was as innovative, such as using a capo to shorten the strings on an acoustic guitar, as on the Rubber Soul album and [...] "Here Comes the Sun", to create a bright, sweet sound. Eric Clapton felt that Harrison was [...] "clearly an innovator" [...] as he was [...] "taking certain elements of R and rock and rockabilly and <b>creating</b> <b>something</b> unique". Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner described Harrison as [...] "a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate, eloquent melodic sense. He played exquisitely {{in the service of}} the song". Harrison's friend and former bandmate Tom Petty agreed: [...] "He just had a way of getting right to the business, of finding the right thing to play." [...] The guitar picking style of Chet Atkins and Carl Perkins influenced Harrison, giving a country music feel to many of the Beatles' recordings. He identified Chuck Berry as an early influence and Ry Cooder as an important later influence.|$|E
500|$|Byard {{pointed out}} that the use of humor did not mean that his music was not serious: [...] "I might do it with humor, but it's still serious because I mean what I'm doing". He stated that his choice to play in a variety of styles was not imitatory or superficial: [...] "I can't play one way all night; I wouldn't want to and I wouldn't want the public to hear me that way". One {{obituary}} writer noted that, [...] "Nobody thinks it odd if a pianist underpins melody with stride patterns or a boogie bass. When Byard did that 30 years ago, distinctions were drawn more tightly". Music writer Dan Lander also stated that Byard's playing was ahead of its time, and added that it has influenced 21st-century pianists: Byard's grasp and integration of historical forms, his ability to embrace tradition and risk taking, was visionary, impacting on a new generation of jazz musicians who understood the history of jazz as a material to build on and work with, at the service of <b>creating</b> <b>something</b> new, rather than as an unmovable weight, fixing them to the past.|$|E
