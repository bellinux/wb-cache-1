30|$|Access control {{models can}} be seen as design {{patterns}} to help the specification of policies. They all consider three main entities: the subject, the action, and the resource. In addition, some access control models propose abstractions. For Barker [9], these abstractions (he calls them categories) represent “any of several fundamental and distinct classes or groups to which entities may be assigned.” One of the advantages of using abstractions is simplifying policies. For instance, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) [10] uses the concept of role to group subjects according to their function in an organization. Other access control models propose abstractions for other elements. Organization-Based Access Control (OrBAC) [11] uses abstractions on all three main elements: roles abstract subjects, activities are for actions, and views for resources. Some access control models are designed for privacy like PBAC [12] that introduces the intent of the subject or P-RBAC [13] that extends RBAC with concepts like purpose, <b>condition,</b> <b>and</b> <b>obligation.</b> An exception is Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). ABAC does not introduce abstraction but is a specification pattern to express authorization policies using any abstraction.|$|R

However, a wider acceptance of formal methods is hindered by their in-sufficient usability and scalability. In this paper, {{we aim at}} assisting developers in rigorous modelling and design by increasing automation of development steps. We introduce a notion of refinement patterns – generic representations of typi-cal correctness-preserving model transformations. Our definition of a refinement pattern contains a description of syntactic model transformations, {{as well as the}} pattern applicability <b>conditions</b> <b>and</b> proof <b>obligations</b> for verification of correct-ness preservation. This establishes a basis for building a tool supporting formal system development via pattern reuse and instantiation.

40|$|Usage CONtrol (UCON) {{model is}} the latest major enhance- ment of the {{traditional}} access control models which enables mutability of subject and object attributes, and continuity of control on usage of resources. In UCON, access permission decision is based on three factors: authorisations, obliga- tions <b>and</b> <b>conditions.</b> While authorisations <b>and</b> <b>obligations</b> are requirements that must be ful lled by the subject <b>and</b> the object, <b>conditions</b> are subject <b>and</b> object independent requirements that must be satis ed by the environment. As a consequence, access permission may be revoked (and the access stopped) {{as a result of}} changes in the environment regardless of whether the authorisations <b>and</b> <b>obligations</b> re- quirements are met. This constitutes a major shortcoming of the UCON model in pervasive computing systems which constantly strive to adapt to environmental changes so as to minimise disruptions to the user. To overcome this limita- tion, this paper proposes a Context-Aware Usage CONtrol (CA-UCON) model which extends the traditional UCON model to enable adaptation to environmental changes in the aim of preserving continuity of access. When the authori- sations <b>and</b> <b>obligations</b> requirements are met by the subject and the object, <b>and</b> the <b>conditions</b> requirements fail due to changes in the environment or the system context, CA- UCON model triggers speci c actions to adapt to the new situation. Besides the data protection, CA-UCON model so enhances the quality of services, striving to keep explicit interactions with the user at a minimum...|$|R

However changing circumstances and various economic fluctuations made it necessary to support agricultural sector and the agricultural sales cooperatives and unions were used actively in certain support policies {{because of the fact that}} they were organized among the producers. In time the subsidies in question caused the cooperatives and unions to be perceived as public institutions and governments started to play a more active role on them. Later the domination of the public influence continued and increased with certain legal arrangements being made for this purpose.

In arguing that resisting oppressive power is as wrong as seizing it, Kant seems committed to the awkward position of denouncing as unrightful any attempts made by the people to establish the only rightful form of constitution.

I also contend that the social contract neither causes the state to exist nor justifies obedience to it. I will proceed to contemplate the civil condition as a state of freedom and, with that in mind, ask two questions about obligation, one relating to the republican form of the state and one to non-republican despotic forms. How can it be that all members of the republic are said to remain free while obligated to law when only a few are granted the law-making citizenship status which is supposed to dissolve the tension between freedom <b>and</b> <b>obligation?</b> How can it be that subjects are obligated to obey an oppressive regime that abuses its authority?

Our study indicates that nonetheless a post-liberal, dialogical approach {{to the issue of}} international debt can be realised, and traces some of its key observations and themes.

In performing this analysis we draw on the work of Atherton, whose approach offers criteria for establishing the adequacy of theological engagement in a plural and globalised context. Analysis of the themes of jubilee, grace and forgiveness, and usury reveal that despite their limitations, they offer valuable and distinctive contributions on issues of power and money, in their insights into the human <b>condition,</b> <b>and</b> into <b>obligations</b> across generations.

In {{parallel with the}} development of the European integration, however, direct jurisdiction was gradually transferred from the nation state to the community organs, which were not democratically authorized. Hence the thesis of the EUs democratic deficit presents an unchallenged fact of the European integration research. This discipline concerned matters including various ways to reduce the democratic deficit, while neglecting one aspect: Even though political parties at the national level impart legitimacy and the establishment of appropriate intermediate mechanisms at the European level would be obvious, this focus does hardly appear to be analyzed in political science. In order to make such a contribution, the presented thesis firstly considers the legitimacy of the party democracies of the member states. Secondly, by confronting the level of legitimacy of the former with that of the European Union, characteristics of supranational rule will be taken into account and research categories for the following analysis of the legitimacy of the European parties will be developed.
