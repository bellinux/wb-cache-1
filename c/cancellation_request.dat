In {{this type of}} programming, the ability to cancel a running task arises as a critical feature. Although {{there are a variety}} of cancellation techniques, a comprehensive account of their characteristics is missing. This paper provides a classification of task cancellation patterns, as well as a detailed analysis of their advantages and disadvantages. One promising approach is cooperative cancellation, where threads must be continuously prepared for external <b>cancellation</b> <b>requests.</b> Based on this pattern, we propose an extension of SCOOP, an object-oriented concurrency model. ...|$|R

With the new asynchronous I/O APIs, a thread, {{different from the one}} that issued the I/O request, can be notified when the operation completes.

If this thread is the one that handles the data after the I/O request completes, then a thread-switch, which causes a performance hit, may be avoided. Windows Vista also introduces synchronous I/O cancellation. During a synchronous I/O request, the application is blocked until the request is serviced or fails.

A pure advance reservation system and a fully shared system using immediate and advance reservation are studied. All considerations made in this paper are limited to a single link.

40|$|We {{study the}} Home Care Problem under uncertainty. Home Care refers to medical, paramedical and social {{services}} that may be delivered to patient homes. The term includes several aspects involved in the planning of home care services, such as caregiver-to-patient assignment, scheduling of patient requests, and caregiver routing. In Home Care, <b>cancellation</b> of <b>requests</b> and additional demand for known or new patients are very frequent. Thus, managing demand uncertainty {{is of paramount importance}} in limiting service disruptions that might occur when such events realize. We address uncertainty of patient demand over a multiple-day time horizon, when assignment, scheduling and routing decisions are taken jointly, both from a methodological and a computational perspective. In fact, we propose a non-standard cardinality-constrained robust approach, analyse its properties, and report the results of a wide experimentation on real-life instances. The obtained results show that, for instances of moderate size, the approach is able to efficiently determine robust solutions of good quality in terms of balancing among caregivers and number of uncertain requests that can be managed. Also, the robustness of the solutions with respect to possible realizations of uncertain requests, evaluated on a small subset of instances, appears to be significant. Furthermore, preliminary experiments on a decomposition method, obtained from the robust one by fixing the scheduling decisions, show a drastic gain in computational efficiency, with the determination of robust solutions of still good quality. Therefore, the approach appears to be very promising to cope with robustness even on Home Care instances of larger size...|$|R
