25|$|Molecular mass or {{molecular}} weight is {{the mass of}} a molecule. It is calculated as {{the sum of the}} atomic weights of each <b>constituent</b> <b>element</b> multiplied by the number of atoms of that element in the molecular formula. The molecular mass of small to medium size molecules, measured by mass spectrometry, determines stoichiometry. For large molecules such as proteins, methods based on viscosity and light-scattering can be used to determine molecular mass when crystallographic data are not available.|$|E

The first, the <b>constituent</b> <b>elements,</b> which influence the image of the space for the Japanese traditional streets, were collected and examined {{as a result of the}} questionnaire in real space. The relation between the variety of the <b>constituent</b> <b>elements</b> and the image was studied by means of the method of correlative analysis and cluster analysis. The second, the change of the image was studied in the psychological experiment by means of modifying the <b>constituent</b> <b>elements</b> on the CRT images operated by computers. The influence of <b>constituent</b> <b>elements</b> on the image was studied by means of the method of quantification I, and analyzed qualitatively. In consequence: 1) The <b>constituent</b> <b>elements</b> that influence on the image were classified, as shown in Table 2. The image of streets that consist of various <b>constituent</b> <b>elements</b> could be modelled and delineated. 2) The image of the space : gorgeousness, hardness, regularity can be represented as a function of the <b>constituent</b> <b>elements.</b> That can be available as indices for the expectation of the image of the real space from the CRT images...|$|R

25|$|The Ginzburg-Landau theory, which {{combined}} Landau's {{theory of}} second-order phase transitions with a Schrödinger-like wave equation, had great success {{in explaining the}} macroscopic properties of superconductors. In particular, Alexei Abrikosov showed that Ginzburg-Landau theory predicts the division of superconductors into the two categories now referred to as Type I and Type II. Abrikosov and Ginzburg were awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work (Landau having died in 1968). Also in 1950, Emanuel Maxwell and, almost simultaneously, C.A.Reynolds et al. found that the critical temperature of a superconductor depends on the isotopic mass of the <b>constituent</b> <b>element.</b> This important discovery pointed to the electron-phonon interaction as the microscopic mechanism responsible for superconductivity.|$|E
2500|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{also came}} {{to be used to}} write Japanese words, resulting in the modern kana syllabaries. Around 650 CE, a writing system called man'yōgana (used in the ancient poetry anthology Man'yōshū) evolved that used a number of Chinese characters for their sound, rather than for their meaning. Man'yōgana written in cursive style evolved into hiragana, or onna-de, that is, [...] "ladies' hand," [...] a writing system that was accessible to women (who were denied higher education). Major works of Heian-era literature by women were written in hiragana. Katakana emerged via a parallel path: monastery students simplified man'yōgana to a single <b>constituent</b> <b>element.</b> Thus the two other writing systems, hiragana and katakana, referred to collectively as kana, are descended from kanji.|$|E

60|$|The motive which {{dictated}} Darius's {{invasion of}} Scythia {{seems to have}} been purely a selfish and domineering love of power. The attempts of a stronger and more highly civilized state to extend its dominion over a weaker and more lawless one, are not, however, necessarily and always of this character. Divine Providence, in making men gregarious in nature, has given them an instinct of organization, which is as intrinsic and as essential a characteristic of the human soul as maternal love or the principle of self-preservation. The right, therefore, of organizations of men to establish law and order among themselves, and to extend these principles to other communities around them, so far as such interpositions are really promotive of the interests and welfare of those affected by them, rests on precisely the same foundation as the right of the father to govern the child. This foundation is the existence and universality of an instinctive principle implanted by the Creator in the human heart; a principle which we are bound to submit to, both because it is a fundamental and <b>constituent</b> <b>element</b> in the very structure of man, and because its recognition and the acknowledgment of its authority are absolutely essential to his continued existence. Wherever law and order, therefore, among men do not exist, it may be properly established and enforced by any neighboring organization that has power to do it, just as wherever there is a group of children they may be justly controlled and governed by their father. It seems equally unnecessary to invent a fictitious and wholly imaginary compact to justify the jurisdiction in the one case as in the other.|$|E
60|$|We may consider, then, as one {{criterion}} of {{the goodness of}} a government, the degree in which it tends to increase the sum of good qualities in the governed, collectively and individually, since, besides that their well-being is the sole object of government, their good qualities supply the moving force which works the machinery. This leaves, as the other <b>constituent</b> <b>element</b> of the merit of a government, the quality of the machinery itself; that is, the degree in which it is adapted {{to take advantage of the}} amount of good qualities which may at any time exist, and make them instrumental to the right purposes. Let us again take the subject of judicature as an example and illustration. The judicial system being given, the goodness of the administration of justice is in the compound ratio of the worth of the men composing the tribunals, and the worth of the public opinion which influences or controls them. But all the difference between a good and a bad system of judicature lies in the contrivances adopted for bringing whatever moral and intellectual worth exists in the community to bear upon the administration of justice, and making it duly operative on the result. The arrangements for rendering the choice of the judges such as to obtain the highest average of virtue and intelligence; the salutary forms of procedure; the publicity which allows observation and criticism of whatever is amiss; the liberty of discussion and cinsure through the press; the mode of taking evidence, according as it is well or ill adapted to elicit truth; the facilities, whatever be their amount, for obtaining access to the tribunals; the arrangements for detecting crimes and apprehending offenders-all these things are not the power, but the machinery for bringing the power into contact with the obstacle; and the machinery has no action of itself, but without it the power, let it be ever so ample, would be wasted and of no effect. A similar distinction exists in regard to the constitution of the executive departments of administration. Their machinery is good, when the proper tests are prescribed for the qualifications of officers, the proper rules for their promotion; when the business is conveniently distributed among those who are to transact it, a convenient and methodical order established for its transaction, a correct and intelligible record kept of it after being transacted; when each individual knows for what he is responsible, and is known to others as responsible for it; when the best-contrived checks are provided against negligence, favoritism, or jobbery in any of the acts of the department. But political checks will no more act of themselves than a bridle will direct a horse without a rider. If the checking functionaries are as corrupt or as negligent as those whom they ought to check, and if the public, the mainspring of the whole checking machinery, are too ignorant, too passive, or too careless and inattentive to do their part, little benefit will be derived from the best administrative apparatus. Yet a good apparatus is always preferable to a bad. It enables such insufficient moving or checking power as exists to act at the greatest advantage; and without it, no amount of moving or checking power would be sufficient. Publicity, for instance, is no impediment to evil, nor stimulus to good, if the public will not look at what is done; but without publicity, how could they either check or encourage what they were not permitted to see? The ideally perfect constitution of a public office is that in which the interest of the functionary is entirely coincident with his duty. No mere system will make it so, but still less can it be made so without a system, aptly devised for the purpose.|$|E
