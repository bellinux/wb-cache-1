[...] It is typically bonded with glycidyl azide polymer (GAP), hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), or <b>carboxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene</b> (<b>CTPB)</b> and requires preheating to 200-300 °C to decompose. The catalyst is a noble metal, similar to the other monopropellants that use silver or palladium.|$|E

The results of end group estimations and viscosity measurements indicated a quantitative reaction between the two reactants under experimental conditions. The clear-zone method was employed in this investigation to test biodegradability. Two strains of Serratia and three strains of Staphylococcus did show a clear zone surrounding the colony.

40|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{understand}} the curing reactions in <b>carboxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene</b> (<b>CTPB),</b> which happens to be the most practical binder in advanced solid composite propellants. The curing of CTPB has been studied for different ratios of curing agents (MAPO and Epoxide) by gel content, molecular weight, crosslink density, and penetration temperature measurements, and the optimum composition of curators for effective curing of CTPB has been determined. Activation energy calculations on the curing of CTPB with 9. 5 % epoxide and 0. 5 % MAPO in the temperature range 75100 °C gave 14. 1 kcal/mol for which a diffusion-controlled or acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening mechanism has been suggested for the curing process in CTPB...|$|E

40|$|This is a {{first report}} in which the {{influence}} of the structure of polymeric binders, such as molecular weight (M), end-group functionality and cis-trans proportion, on the combustion behaviour of composite solid propellants (CSP) has been examined. In admixture with ammonium perchlorate (AP), dicarboxylic acids were used to simulate the commonly used telechelic polymers such as <b>carboxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene</b> (<b>CTPB)</b> fuels. The burning rate varies exponentially with the M of the acids and embraces the values for CTPB. The end-group effect diminishes at higher M due to dilution of the acid groups. The dependence of on M is expressed as a newly defined molecular weight sensitivity of burning rate (σ_ m). The σ_m values can be divided into three regimes: I (118 200) for polymeric fuels. The σ_ m values in regimes I and II are explained by the selective tendency for anhydride formation; in regime III, fragmentation of the polymeric fuel occurs. In regimes I and II, volatilization of the acids occurs at lower temperatures than for their neat form and in regime II this volatilization is limited by the phase transition of AP. The volatilization rate decreases with increase in M, but the ratio of the condensed-phase to gas-phase heat release increases with M...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of viscoelastic filled polymers strongly depend on temperature and strain rate and vary for several orders of magnitude. During service life, a viscoelastic body, especially <b>carboxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene</b> (<b>CTPB)</b> composite solid rocket propellant grain, {{is subjected to}} many stress-inducing loads. Its structural integrity analysis (hereafter: “structural analysis”), unlike elastic bodies, is quite complex and sometimes impossible under the action of just a single load. An even greater problem occurs when multiple different types of loads act simultaneously. This study {{is based on a}} complete uniaxial mechanical characterization of a viscoelastic CTPB composite rocket propellant, made in MTI- -Belgrade, whose results were used for the analysis of the propellant grain reliability. Through an example, this paper shows a behavior of the viscoelastic propellant grain when it is subjected to extremely different environmental loads at the same time. Similar explicit examples are difficult to found in the literature, except in the form of recommended principles for analysis. It is shown that the tensile strength under the action of fast load due to the pressure may be almost 20 times greater than the tensile strength under the slow temperature load. A probabilistic approach is presented in evaluation the reliability and service life. An example is shown for a rocket propellant grain as a viscoelastic body. The presented principles of the analysis can be applied to any arbitrary viscoelastic body in other areas...|$|E

Propellant weight-loss prior to ignition and high pressure ignition temperature data on the propellants, ammonium per chlorate, and binders show that the ignition is governed by the gasification of the binder pyrolysis products. The activation energy for the gasification of the pyrolysed polymer products corresponds to their ignition behaviour suggesting that propellant ignition is controlled by the binder...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{decomposition}} of three commercial samples of <b>carboxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene</b> (PBCT) resins was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at heating rates varying from 2 ° to 100 °C/min. Kinetic {{parameters of the}} decomposition process at different heating rates were evaluated {{by means of the}} Fuoss method. 1 The decomposition process and the activation energy values are found to be dependent on heating rate. Mass-spectrometric analysis of the decomposition products shows that the pyrolysis products of PBCT resins are mainly low molecular weight hydrocarbons: ethylene, acetylene, butadiene, propadiene, vinylcyclohexene, etc. The rates of evolution of these hydrocarbon products vary with the carboxy content of the PBCT resin. Based on this, a carbonium ion mechanism has been suggested for the {{thermal decomposition}}. The data generated from this work are of importance for a consideration of the mechanism of combustion of composite solid propellants based on PBCT binders...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{segmental}} {{dynamics of}} rigid, intermediate, and mobile molecular components in carboxyl terminated <b>polybutadiene</b> (<b>CTPB)</b> / organo−clay (C 18 −clay) systems {{was characterized by}} fully refocused 1 H NMR FID. In addition, 1 H DQ NMR experiments allowed semiquantitative monitoring of changes in segmental dynamics near the interface. Both methods suggest a critical concentration of 60 wt % CTPB, indicating a saturation effect for the surface-adsorbed polymer. While the critical concentration value of a polymer/clay system {{can be measured in}} several ways, this is its first direct evidence at the molecular scale. The polymer−clay interaction is found to profoundly change with the removal of the CTPB end group or the organic modifier on the clay surface thus impacting the polymer segmental dynamics near the clay surface. In C 18 −clay by itself, with increasing temperature, the dynamic behavior of surface modifier changes from homogeneous to heterogeneous, on the basis of which the nonreversible exfoliation process of CTPB/clay nanocomposites could be explained at the molecular level. Based on the 1 H NMR results, a tentative model wa...|$|R
40|$|A first {{comprehensive}} {{investigation on}} the deflagration of ammonium perchlorate (AP) in the subcritical regime, below the low pressure deflagration limit (LPL, 2. 03 MPa) christened as regime I^', is discussed {{by using an}} elegant thermodynamic approach. In this regime, deflagration was effected by augmenting the initial temperature (T_ 0) of the AP strand and by adding fuels like aliphatic dicarboxylic acids or polymers like carboxy terminated <b>polybutadiene</b> (<b>CTPB).</b> From this thermodynamic model, considering the dependence of burning rate (ṙ) on pressure (P) and T_ 0, the true condensed (E_s,c) and gas phase (E_s,g) activation energies, just below and above the surface respectively, have been obtained and the data clearly distinguishes the deflagration mechanisms in regime I^' and I (2. 03 - 6. 08 MPa). Substantial reduction in the E_s,c of regime I^', {{compared to that of}} regime I, is attributed to HClO_ 4 catalysed decomposition of AP. HClO_ 4 formation, which occurs only in regime I^', promotes dent formation on the surface as revealed by the reflectance photomicrographs, in contrast to the smooth surface in regime I. The HClO_ 4 vapours, in regime I^', also catalyse the gas phase reactions and thus bring down the E_s,g too. The excess heat transferred on to the surface from the gas phase is used to melt AP and hence E_s,c, in regime I, corresponds to the melt AP decomposition. It is consistent with the similar variation observed for both the melt layer thickness and ṙ as a function of P. Thermochemical calculations of the surface heat release support the thermodynamic model and reveal that the AP sublimation reduces the required critical exothermicity of 1108. 8 kJ kg^- 1 at the surface. It accounts for the AP not sustaining combustion in the subcritical regime I^'. Further support for the model comes from the temperature-time profiles of the combustion train of AP. The gas and condensed phase enthalpies, derived from the profile, give excellent agreement with those computed thermochemically. The σ _p expressions derived from this model establish the mechanistic distinction of regime I^' and I and thus lend support to the thermodynamic model. On comparing the deflagration of strand against powder AP, the proposed thermodynamic model correctly predicts that the total enthalpy of the condensed and gas phases remains unaltered. However, 16...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} to develop and test a new {{propellant}} formulation specifically for the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) for the robotic Mars Sample Return mission. The project was initiated under the Planetary Sciences Division In-Space Propulsion Technology (ISPT) program and is continuing under the Mars Exploration Program. The two-stage, solid motor-based MAV has been the leading MAV solution {{for more than a}} decade. Additional studies show promise for alternative technologies including hybrid and bipropellant options, but the solid motor design has significant propellant density advantages well suited for physical constraints imposed while using the SkyCrane descent stage. The solid motor concept has lower specific impulse (Isp) than alternatives, but if the first stage and payload remain sufficiently small, the two-stage solid MAV represents a potential low risk approach to meet the mission needs. As the need date for the MAV slips, opportunities exist to advance technology with high on-ramp potential. The baseline propellant for the MAV is currently the carboxyl terminated <b>polybutadiene</b> (<b>CTPB)</b> based formulation TP-H- 3062 due to its advantageous low temperature mechanical properties and flight heritage. However, the flight heritage is limited and outside the environments, the MAV must endure. The ISPT program competed a propellant formulation project with industry and selected ATK to develop a new propellant formulation specifically for the MAV application. Working with ATK, a large number of propellant formulations were assessed to either increase performance of a CTPB propellant or improve the low temperature mechanical properties of a hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) propellant. Both propellants demonstrated potential to increase performance over heritage options, but an HTPB propellant formulation, TP-H- 3544, was selected for production and testing. The test plan includes propellant aging first at high vacuum conditions, representative of the Mars transit, followed by an additional year at simulated Mars surface conditions. The actual Mars surface environment is based on the igloo design, actively maintains the propellant at or above - 40 degC, 95 % carbon dioxide at Mars surface pressure. The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Mars environment test facility is shown in figure 1 and located in the East Test area of Redstone Arsenal due to storage of live propellants. The facility consists of a vacuum chamber placed inside a large freezer unit. The facility includes pressure and temperature monitoring equipment in addition to a vacuum quality monitoring system spectrometer to record any outgassing products...|$|R
40|$|Nanocomposite gels {{were formed}} by mixing {{organically}} modified clay into a linear polymer, dicarboxyl-terminated <b>polybutadiene</b> (<b>CTPB).</b> Two similar but differently sized counterions {{were chosen for}} preparing the organoclay. The polymer-clay interaction causes the clay aggregates to break up into particles, which swell, exfoliate, and eventually assume a stable dispersion in the polymer matrix. The bulkiness of the different-sized counterions affects the dispersion process and the final, stable clay-polymer network structure. The use of two different organoclays allows comparison of the observed phenomena. Parameters of the study are clay concentration [straight phi] and distance from the gel point. As a main result, the nanocomposite with the larger counterion exfoliates faster but requires more clay to form a percolating structure. It also forms the weaker gel. These seaming contradictions (fast exfoliation but weak gel) are attributed to steric effects of the large counterion. The low frequency linear viscoelastic behavior was analyzed using a percolation model (near the percolation threshold [straight phi]c) and the power law (far above the percolation threshold). The degree of agreement between the experimental data and models was used to theorize that the particle-polymer interactions are the controlling factor in the increasing solid-like behavior with increasing clay content. Rheology is also employed to study the dynamics of structure development for a model nanocomposite of clay in a low Mw polymer. The clay, organically modified with macro-counterions, gradually exfoliates in an endfunctionalized linear polymer. Polymer and clay connect into a sample spanning network with increasing modulus and decreasing relaxation time as the exfoliation proceeds {{and more and more}} clay surface becomes accessible. The product of modulus and relaxation time stays constant as observed earlier for another physical gel. The rheological measurements suggest that the classical diffusion model of exfoliation is incomplete. Trends in the ripening time, the distance to the final stable clay dispersion and in changing concentrations support a layer-by-layer peeling mechanism over the traditional exfoliation theory. The layer-by-layer peeling mechanism proposes that the polymer chains follow Langmuir isothermal adsorption and pull on the clay stacks, first breaking the clay pack into smaller stacks, and then possibly peeling the clay sheets off one-by-one if the force required to break the stack becomes too great. Intermittent flow forward (IFF) and intermittent flow reverse (IFR) protocol are used to study the structure breakdown and reformation in CTPB/organoclay nanocomposites, which is found to be caused by the clay layers orientation. The orientation relaxation is accelerated due to the strong interaction between the CTPB and clay surface via hydrogen bonding. A new optical linear rheometer was developed that allows simultaneously conducting rheological experiments, light scattering, and microscopy. Unlike rotational motor in commercial rheometers, a linear motor is used, which ensure uniform shear through samples...|$|R
