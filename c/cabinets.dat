5|$|Robotron: 2084 was commercially successful; Williams sold {{approximately}} 19,000arcade <b>cabinets,</b> and mini <b>cabinets</b> and cocktail versions {{were later}} produced. The different arcade versions have since become {{varying levels of}} rarity; the cocktail and cabaret versions are very rare, while the upright <b>cabinets</b> are more available. It {{is one of the}} most collected arcade games, and is consistently higher priced than other titles among collectors.|$|E
5|$|By 2002, the {{executive}} branch had again grown to fourteen <b>cabinets,</b> but had no additional departments. Shortly after his election in 2003, Governor Ernie Fletcher undertook the last major reorganization of {{the executive}} branch to date, reducing the number of <b>cabinets</b> to nine—Justice and Public Safety, Education and Workforce Development, Environmental and Public Protection, Transportation, Economic Development, Health and Family Services, Finance and Administration, Tourism, Arts and Heritage, and Personnel.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{top secret}} nature of the work, the Los Alamos Laboratory was isolated. Feynman indulged his curiosity by {{discovering}} the combination locks on <b>cabinets</b> and desks used to secure papers. He found that people tended to leave their safes unlocked, or leave them on the factory settings, or write the combinations down, or use easily guessable combinations like dates. Feynman played jokes on colleagues. In one case he found the combination to a locked filing cabinet by trying the numbers he thought a physicist would use (it proved to be 27–18–28 after the base of natural logarithms, e = 2.71828...), {{and found that the}} three filing <b>cabinets</b> where a colleague kept a set of atomic bomb research notes all had the same combination. He left a series of notes in the <b>cabinets</b> as a prank, which initially spooked his colleague, Frederic de Hoffmann, into thinking a spy or saboteur had gained access to atomic bomb secrets.|$|E
5|$|The yearlong {{conversion}} began October 9, 2011. Between October and December, 96 of Jaguar's 200 <b>cabinets,</b> each containing 24 XT5 blades (two 6-core CPUs per node, four nodes per blade), were {{upgraded to}} XK7 blades (one 16-core CPU per node, four nodes per blade) while {{the remainder of}} the machine remained in use. In December, computation was moved to the 96 XK7 <b>cabinets</b> while the remaining 104 <b>cabinets</b> were upgraded to XK7 blades. ORNL's external ESnet connection was upgraded from 10 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s and the system interconnect (the network over which CPUs communicate with each other) was updated. The Seastar design used in Jaguar was upgraded to the Gemini interconnect used in Titan which connects the nodes into a direct 3D torus interconnect network. Gemini uses wormhole flow control internally. The system memory was doubled to 584 TiB. 960 of the XK7 nodes (10 <b>cabinets)</b> were fitted with a Fermi based GPU as Kepler GPUs were not then available; these 960 nodes were referred to as TitanDev and used to test code. This first phase of the upgrade increased the peak performance of Jaguar to 3.3 petaFLOPS. Beginning on September 13, 2012, Nvidia K20X GPUs were fitted to all of Jaguar's XK7 compute blades, including the 960 TitanDev nodes. In October, the task was completed and the computer was finally christened Titan.|$|E
5|$|Asteroids {{was one of}} {{the first}} major hits of the golden age of arcade games. The game sold over 70,000 arcade <b>cabinets</b> and proved both popular with players and {{influential}} with developers. It has since been ported to multiple platforms. Asteroids was widely imitated and directly influenced Defender, Gravitar, and many other video games.|$|E
50|$|The Governor {{and each}} member of the <b>Cabinet</b> has an office {{dedicated}} to <b>Cabinet</b> affairs. These offices are headed by a Chief <b>Cabinet</b> Aide, who is assisted by other aides. The week prior to a <b>Cabinet</b> meeting, the <b>Cabinet</b> aides meet to discuss the agenda and to conduct preliminary discussions on a variety of issues slated to come before the full <b>Cabinet.</b> <b>Cabinet</b> aides meetings are considered {{an important part of the}} <b>Cabinet</b> process.|$|R
5000|$|An {{official}} minority <b>cabinet</b> (not having demissionary status) {{is formed}} after the breaking up of a <b>cabinet.</b> Such a minority caretaker <b>cabinet</b> has as primary task to organise elections. Yet it {{has much more}} authority in proposing new law and suggestion policy compared to a demissionary <b>cabinet.</b> The new <b>cabinet</b> {{is seen as a}} successor rather than the continuation of the fallen <b>cabinet</b> (example Netherlands <b>cabinet</b> Balkenende-3 followed up on Netherlands <b>cabinet</b> Balkenende-2).|$|R

Its final upgrades brought Jaguar to 1.76 petaFLOPS.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII chose many centrist <b>cabinets,</b> as {{he wanted}} to appease the populace, much {{to the dismay of}} his brother, the ultra-royalist Count of Artois.

50|$|The United Kingdom {{practices}} <b>cabinet</b> collective responsibility. The {{prime minister}} selects {{a number of}} <b>cabinet</b> ministers from the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Once selected as <b>cabinet</b> ministers, each minister is given a position as head {{of one of the}} government departments. <b>Cabinet</b> ministers respond to oral questions from MPs. The <b>cabinet</b> members, along with the Prime Minister, schedule weekly closed door sessions to discuss the collective stance of the <b>cabinet</b> to avoid inconsistent responses from <b>cabinet</b> ministers. The solidarity of the <b>cabinet</b> is consistently challenged by the opposition in an attempt to create contradictions between <b>cabinet</b> ministers. It is therefore imperative for the <b>cabinet</b> members to have their responses as common and similar as possible.|$|R
5000|$|A demissionary <b>cabinet</b> {{continues}} {{the current government}} after a <b>cabinet</b> has ended. This can either be after completion of the full term, between general elections (when the new house of representatives is installed) {{and the formation of}} a new <b>cabinet,</b> or after a <b>cabinet</b> crisis. In both cases the prime minister hands in the resignation of his <b>cabinet</b> to the Dutch Monarch. The Monarch will not accept full resignation until a new <b>cabinet</b> has been formed. Between the moment in which the prime minister hands in the resignation and the monarch installs a new <b>cabinet,</b> the <b>cabinet</b> is labelled demissionary. As a demissionary <b>cabinet</b> is considered a continuation of the previous <b>cabinet,</b> it is not counted as a new <b>cabinet</b> (e.g. Balkenende IV did not become Balkenende V when becoming demissionary).|$|R
50|$|Sega Rally 3 is {{available}} in four different <b>cabinet</b> configurations: a large single player deluxe <b>cabinet</b> with motion simulation system, a large single player deluxe non-motion <b>cabinet,</b> a smaller twin non-motion <b>cabinet</b> and finally a single player non-motion <b>cabinet</b> (for the US market only).|$|R
5|$|Robotron: 2084 was {{critically}} and commercially successful. Praise among critics {{focused on}} the game's intense action and control scheme.

It was ported to numerous platforms.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} monaural {{sound and}} pixel graphics on a 19inch CRT monitor. The initial concept was conceived by John Kotlarik, who aimed {{to create a}} non-violent game. Inspired by Pac-Man, he envisioned similar gameplay in an open playing field {{rather than in a}} maze. Python Anghelo furthered the concept by creating artwork and a scenario. Kotlarik designed the protagonist to have fluid movement like it was traveling on a slick surface. The control scheme allows the digital input to operate similar to an analogue one. He programmed the bubble to accelerate in the direction the joystick is held. Once the joystick returns to its neutral position, the bubble will coast as the velocity slowly decreases. Anghelo designed the artwork for the wooden <b>cabinets</b> as well as a new cylindrical, plastic cabinet. Gary Berge, a mechanical engineer, created the new <b>cabinets</b> with a rotational molding process.|$|E
5|$|The tone cabinet was {{originally}} the only method of adding reverberation to a Hammond organ; reverb was not fitted to older organs. The most commercially successful tone <b>cabinets</b> were probably the PR series, particularly the 40-watt PR40.|$|E
50|$|Under the Westminster system, {{members of}} the <b>cabinet</b> are Ministers of the Crown who are collectively {{responsible}} for all government policy. All ministers, whether senior and in the <b>cabinet</b> or junior ministers, must publicly support {{the policy of the}} government, regardless of any private reservations. Although, in theory, all <b>cabinet</b> decisions are taken collectively by the <b>cabinet,</b> in practice many decisions are delegated to the various sub-committees of the <b>cabinet,</b> which report to the full <b>cabinet</b> on their findings and recommendations. As these recommendations have already been agreed upon by those in the <b>cabinet</b> who hold affected ministerial portfolios, the recommendations are usually agreed to by the full <b>cabinet</b> with little further discussion. The <b>cabinet</b> may also provide ideas on/if new laws were established, and what they include. <b>Cabinet</b> deliberations are secret and documents dealt with in <b>cabinet</b> are confidential. Most of the documentation associated with <b>cabinet</b> deliberations will only be publicly released a considerable period after the particular <b>cabinet</b> disbands, depending on provisions of a nation's Freedom of Information Act.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Cabinet</b> is a collegiate body {{consisting}} of the <b>Cabinet's</b> presidium composed of five individual and several ministries that are represented by their respective minister. Some ministries may be headed {{by members of the}} <b>Cabinet</b> presidium (Vice Prime Ministers). The presidium of <b>Cabinet</b> is composed of the Prime Minister of Ukraine presiding over the <b>Cabinet</b> and assisted by his First Vice Prime and other Vice Prime ministers. The Secretariat of <b>Cabinet</b> of Ministers ensures the operations of the <b>cabinet.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Cabinet</b> Office (Naikaku-fu) is {{an agency}} of the <b>Cabinet</b> of Japan. It is {{responsible}} for handling the day-to-day affairs of the <b>Cabinet.</b> The <b>Cabinet</b> Office is formally headed by the Prime Minister. There are usually three Vice-Ministers (fuku-daijin) and three Parliamentary Secretaries (daijin seimukan) in the <b>Cabinet</b> Office.|$|R
5|$|When {{specimens}} are to {{be placed}} in any size of container for long-term storage or display, the consistent use of only archival-quality materials prevents the development of Byne's disease. Thus, materials such as metal <b>cabinets</b> and display cases, archival quality paper labels and card trays are used in museum collections of specimens that might be vulnerable to this reaction.|$|E
5|$|By September, {{the game}} was still unfinished, and almost every Williams {{programmer}} assisted in meeting the deadline for the AMOA trade show. The evening before the trade show, the arcade <b>cabinets</b> were delivered for display. The developers, however, forgot to create an attract mode—an automated sequence designed to entice an audience to play—for the game, and began working on it that night. Early the next morning, the team created the final EPROM chips for the mode and installed them in <b>cabinets.</b> The chips, however, did not work and the designers made additional attempts to correct the problem. Once the attract mode was operational, Jarvis and the team returned to their homes {{to prepare for the}} show. After the show, the developers expanded the game to allow users to play indefinitely. The display model featured five levels, which the team felt was more than enough because of the game's difficulty. Most Williams employees could not progress past the third level and Jarvis's score of 60,000points seemed unbeatable to them. The developers decided it was best to be prepared for players that might exceed their expectations and added more levels that repeated.|$|E
5|$|Bynesian decay usually starts when {{specimens}} {{are stored}} or displayed for considerable {{periods of time}} in an enclosed space. The storage method itself usually causes this problem, when containers, <b>cabinets</b> or display cases are entirely or partially made of wood, plywood or other wood products such as Masonite, or when the specimens are surrounded by, or in contact with, various other kinds of materials that are cellulose-based and can turn water vapor acidic.|$|E
