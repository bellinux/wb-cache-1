Accidentally bumped by them, Stewie tumbles {{down the stairs}} and becomes unconscious, {{suffering}} a severe head wound. Chris and Meg hide the wound with a hat. Continuing the charade, they are approached by Peter, who asks how long Stewie has been unconscious. Peter reveals that he has knocked both of them out plenty of times, and wants to continue hiding Stewie's injury from Lois until he <b>can</b> <b>frame</b> her for it. The next day, noticing Lois pulling out of the driveway, Peter throws Stewie behind her car, making it appear as if Lois has run him over. Lois suggests they frame someone else, but Peter professes his love for her and suggests they take Stewie to the hospital. At the end of the show, Stewie walks in on the family with his head wrapped in bandages, revealing that many months have passed since his accident, he asks what happened to him.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{either from}} {{religious}} belief or from science, Spencer argued, we are ultimately driven to accept certain indispensable but literally inconceivable notions. Whether {{we are concerned}} with a Creator or the substratum which underlies our experience of phenomena, we <b>can</b> <b>frame</b> no conception of it. Therefore, Spencer concluded, religion and science agree in the supreme truth that the human understanding is only capable of 'relative' knowledge. This is the case since, owing to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to obtain knowledge of phenomena, not of the reality ('the absolute') underlying phenomena. Hence both science and religion must come to recognise as the 'most certain of all facts that the Power which the Universe manifests to us is utterly inscrutable.' He called this awareness of 'the Unknowable' and he presented worship of the Unknowable as capable of being a positive faith which could substitute for conventional religion. Indeed, {{he thought that the}} Unknowable represented the ultimate stage in the evolution of religion, the final elimination of its last anthropomorphic vestiges.|$|E
500|$|Before {{making a}} shot, the player may select a club {{and adjust the}} general {{direction}} of the swing.

The player clicks three times: first to initiate the backswing, which causes a timing indicator to move along the meter; second to begin the downswing; and third to [...] "snap" [...] the shot, which determines accuracy. Changes in the timing of these clicks alter the shot. A red section on the far end of the swing meter represents overswinging, which negatively affects shots.

5000|$|A CAN network can be {{configured}} to {{work with}} two different message (or [...] "frame") formats: the standard or base frame format (described in CAN 2.0 A and CAN 2.0 B), and the extended frame format (only described by CAN 2.0 B).

A CAN-over-IP tunneling protocol is described and the design and implementation of a generic system for remote access to the CAN bus of vehicles is presented. Examples of applications of the technology are given and implications in terms of new possibilities and challenges in automotive engineering are discussed.

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that Control Area Networks (CAN) {{are used in}} real-time, {{distributed}} and parallel processing which cover manufacture plants, humanoid robots, networking fields, etc. Where wireless conditions are encountered it is convenient, as we will demonstrate later, to continue the exchange of <b>CAN</b> <b>frames</b> within a baptized Wireless CAN (WCAN). While we define the WCAN, we adopted the RTS/CTS scheme {{to gain access to}} the medium in a first step and the exchange of ordinary <b>CAN</b> <b>frames</b> in a second step [1, 2, 3]. The latency time is the most important factor to consider when evaluating a control network. The latency incurred in message delivery has not been a metric to be optimized. So in the second part of this paper, we compute the throughput-latency time couple that would guarantee a maximum throughput and a minimum latency time in the case of wireless communications, precisely in WCAN. This work represents our real contribution by introducing the WCAN concept for the first time, by the correct definition of WCAN frames, by the evaluation of parameters boundaries of WCAN, and by the calculation of the latency time and its coupling to the throughput, according the medium access scheme. Key words: WCAN protocol, RTS/CTS Media Reservation Mechanism...|$|R
6000|$|These {{considerations}} also {{remove the}} objection {{arising from the}} impossibility of ocularly following the lines in their prolongation to infinity. For though, in order actually to see that two given lines never meet, {{it would be necessary}} to follow them to infinity; yet without doing so we may know that if they ever do meet, or if, after diverging from one another, they begin again to approach, this must take place not at an infinite, but at a finite distance. Supposing, therefore, such to be the case, we can transport ourselves thither in imagination, and <b>can</b> <b>frame</b> a mental image of the appearance which {{one or both of the}} lines must present at that point, which we may rely on as being precisely similar to the reality. Now, whether we fix our contemplation upon this imaginary picture, or call to mind the generalizations we have had occasion to make from former ocular observation, we learn by the evidence of experience, that a line which, after diverging from another straight line, begins to approach to it, produces the impression on our senses which we describe by the expression, “a bent line,” not by the expression, “a straight line.”(73) ...|$|E

The degrees or extent wherein we ascribe existence, power, wisdom, and all other perfections (which we can have any ideas of) to that sovereign Being, which we call G-d, being all boundless and infinite, we frame the best idea of him our minds are capable of: all which is done, I say, by enlarging those simple ideas we have taken from the operations of our own minds, by reflection; or by our senses, from exterior things, to that vastness to which infinity can extend them.|$|E
