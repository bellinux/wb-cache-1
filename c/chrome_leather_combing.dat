40|$|One serious {{consequence}} of the current consumer society is {{the transformation of the}} environment into a waste receptacle arising from human activities. Because of the potential toxic effects of chromium solid waste containing this metal there are grounds for serious concern for the tanning and leather processing industry. The application of tannery waste as organic fertilizer has led to extensive contamination by chromium in agricultural areas and may cause the accumulation of this metal in soils and plants. This work evaluated the extraction of Cr+ 3 and Cr+ 6 contained in solid waste from the leather industry through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Gibbs free energy calculations reveal that the chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) forms more stable complexes with metal ions of chromium compared with the structures of the complexes [Cr(NTA) (H 2 O) 2] and [Cr-collagen], the latter used to simulate the protein bound <b>chrome</b> <b>leather...</b>|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{decomposition}} of <b>chrome</b> tanned <b>leather</b> {{before and after}} a soaking treatment with NaOH was studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The effect of the solution concentration (0. 2 M and 0. 5 M) and the soaking time (5 min and 15 min) was evaluated. TGA experiments at four heating rates (5, 10, 15 and 20 °C min− 1) were run {{in a nitrogen atmosphere}} for every treatment condition. A kinetic model was developed considering the effect of the three variables studied, i. e. : the NaOH solution concentration, the soaking time and the heating rate. The proposed model for <b>chrome</b> tanned <b>leather</b> pyrolysis involves a set of four reactions, i. e. : three independent nth order reactions, yielding the corresponding products and one of them undergoing a successive cero order reaction.
