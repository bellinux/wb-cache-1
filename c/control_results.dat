In this double-blind RCT, 499 primarily breast-fed infants were fed for 6 months with a daily milk-based complementary food that included either whey protein concentrate enriched in MFGM, or {{an equal amount of}} additional protein from skim milk (<b>control).</b> <b>Results</b> showed that the group with the MFGM-supplemented diet had a significantly lower prevalence of diarrhea during the study compared to the control group (3.84% vs 4.37%; P<0.05), as well as a significant reduction (46%) in episodes of bloody diarrhea compared to the control group (P=0.025).|$|E
25|$|Paralysis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of damage to α-MNs. Because α-MNs provide the only voluntary innervation to extrafusal muscle fibers, losing α-MNs effectively severs the connection between the brainstem and spinal cord and the muscles they innervate. Without this connection, voluntary and involuntary (reflex) muscle control is impossible. Voluntary muscle control is lost because α-MNs relay voluntary signals from upper motor neurons to muscle fibers. Loss of involuntary <b>control</b> <b>results</b> from interruption of reflex circuits such as the tonic stretch reflex. A consequence of reflex interruption is that muscle tone is reduced, resulting in flaccid paresis. Another consequence is the depression of deep tendon reflexes, causing hyporeflexia.|$|E
25|$|Luthor {{does not}} {{physically}} appear in The Man of Steel until the fourth issue, {{which takes place}} over a year after Superman's arrival in Metropolis. When Lois Lane and Clark Kent are invited to a society gala aboard Luthor's yacht, terrorists seize the ship without warning, forcing Superman to intervene. Luthor observes Superman in action, and once the gunmen are dispatched, hands the hero a personal cheque {{in an attempt to}} hire him. When Luthor admits that he had not only anticipated the attack, but had arranged for it to occur in order to lure Superman out, the Mayor deputizes Superman to arrest Luthor for reckless endangerment. This, coupled with the indignation that Superman is the only person he could not buy off, threaten, or otherwise <b>control,</b> <b>results</b> in Luthor's pledge to destroy Superman at any cost. As such, he is more than willing to help other businessmen destroy other superbeings. He was instrumental in the apparent death of Swamp Thing, which jeopardized many lives as the Parliament of Trees attempted to replace him.|$|E

50|$|Wheel-barrowing is {{a problem}} that may occur when a pilot places {{excessive}} forward pressure on the flight controls of an aeroplane with a tricycle gear configuration during takeoff or landing.

50|$|During low-rpm operation, {{only one}} intake valve opens, {{allowing}} air and fuel into the combustion chamber. The other intake valve {{has only a}} slight amount of lift and its timing is staggered. As a result, the air-fuel charge drawn through the open intake valve undergoes a swirl effect. The swirl creates a stratified charge with a rich mixture near the spark plug for good light-off, and a progressively leaner mixture toward its periphery. This stratified charge, combined with improved EGR <b>control,</b> <b>results</b> in lower emissions especially during the critical warm-up period, and better fuel economy. Low-friction, roller-bearing rocker arms are used to help reduce friction and improve engine efficiency.|$|E

50|$|Racing engines {{often fail}} at high {{rotational}} speeds because mechanical springs {{are unable to}} retract the valves quickly enough to provide clearance for the piston. Renault's pneumatic valve technology replaced steel springs with light weight compressed air bellows. These could retract valves more quickly and reduce the possibility of piston-valve interference, as long as pressure could be maintained. Additionally, the amount of seat tension required to keep a coil sprung valve under <b>control</b> <b>results</b> in greater peak lift loading, with added stress to the entire valvetrain as a result. Pneumatic systems, sharing a common reservoir of pressure retain a more static level of force, controlling the valve effectively, without any attendant peak lift load increase.|$|E

50|$|Every vehicle {{function}} that changes direction or speed relies on {{friction between the}} tires and the road surface. The grooves of a rubber tire are designed to disperse water from beneath the tire, providing high friction even in wet conditions. Aquaplaning occurs when a tire encounters more water than it can dissipate. Water pressure {{in front of the}} wheel forces a wedge of water under {{the leading edge of the}} tire, causing it to lift from the road. The tire then skates on a sheet of water with little, if any, direct road contact, and loss of <b>control</b> <b>results.</b> If multiple tires aquaplane, the vehicle may lose directional control and slide until it either collides with an obstacle, or slows enough that one or more tires contact the road again and friction is regained.|$|E
50|$|Concerns {{regarding}} whether benzodiazepines {{during pregnancy}} cause major malformations, in particular cleft palate, have been hotly debated in the literature. A meta {{analysis of the}} data from cohort studies found no link but meta analysis of case control studies did find a significant increase in major malformations. (However, the cohort studies were homogenous and the case control studies were heterogeneous, thus reducing the strength of the case <b>control</b> <b>results).</b> There have also been several reports that suggest that benzodiazepines have the potential to cause a syndrome similar to fetal alcohol syndrome, but this has been disputed by a number of studies. As a result of conflicting findings, use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy is controversial. The best available evidence suggests that benzodiazepines are not a major cause of birth defects, i.e. major malformations or cleft lip or cleft palate.|$|E
