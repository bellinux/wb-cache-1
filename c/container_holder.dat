40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} the composition of the storage <b>container,</b> <b>Holder</b> pasteurisation, and conditions during tube feeding on the concentration of selected vitamins in human milk. Though the fat soluble vitamins A, D, and E were not affected, the concentration of several water soluble vitamins decreased. The lower vitamin C concentration of milk stored in polypropylene containers compared with milk stored in glass containers (29 %) was not significant. Holder pasteurisation significantly lowered the concentrations of vitamins C (36 %), folacin (31 %), and B 6 (15 %). Tube feeding significantly lowered the concentrations of vitamins C (44 %) and B 6 (19 %), and exposure to phototherapy seemed to lower the vitamin C concentration (53 %) further. Low birthweight infants have increased vitamin requirements. Vitamin losses in expressed human milk before or during feeding may increase the incidence of vitamin deficiencies in these babies...|$|E
40|$|DE 29917940 U UPAB: 20000301 NOVELTY - For each channel {{there is}} a holder (9) {{accepting}} a test volume or container (2) holding it. For each holder {{there is a}} load cell (1) to weigh the container and/or the sample volume. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preferred Features: Each holder rests directly on its load cell, or is connected via a rod or lever system to it. Adjacent rods or levers seen from the holders, include an angle greater than zero, and/or are arranged in different planes. Spacing between adjacent load cells is the same as, or greater than, that of adjacent channels. Weighing cells include a strain gauge or operate {{on the principle of}} electromagnetic force balance. A <b>container</b> <b>holder</b> (8) moves between sample-holding and weighing positions. The holder (8) {{is at the end of}} an arm with a calibration weight receptacle, used when the holder is in the sample holding position. The holder has two jaws gripping or releasing containers. Load cells (1) and holder (8) move relatively to one another. Movements are provided pneumatically, by stepper motors and/or servomotors. Weighing cells are surrounded by a separate casing having an opening into which a rod is guided, connecting weighing cells with allocated holders (9). A sensor measures sample volume indirectly. A compressed air sensor and/or a sample fluid temperature sensor and/or an air temperature sensor are included. A computer controls operations and calculations. The containers taper towards their openings. USE - To test the accuracy of multichannel pipettes. ADVANTAGE - The accuracy of multichannel pipettes can be tested in accordance with quality assurance requirements and national standards of accuracy. The new machine mainly tests automatically, shortening the time required. Test results are automatically calculated and presented...|$|E
50|$|Mey Eden is {{a leading}} mineral water company in Israel. The brand and company were created in 1980 after {{development}} of the Salukia wellspring in Katzrin, Golan Heights. After additional tests with the wellspring water, Mey Eden received permission to market its water in 1983. Mey Eden has recently started to product water coolers, water <b>container</b> <b>holders</b> and disposable cups as well.|$|R

40|$|Infrared {{spectroscopy}} laboratories works under permanent {{care with}} respect to water contamination, mainly in liquid samples. In this case crystal plates destruction or damage are frequent, increasing the operational expenses. On the other hand, the laboratory which produces such samples must be very careful in drying liquid samples. In this work we develop a simple and inexpensive way to operate in such conditions using polypropylene and HDPE films which were thermally soldered resulting little <b>containers</b> or sample <b>holders.</b> The spectra of sample/ sample holder is achieved having the sample holder as background...|$|R
25|$|Pottery {{is a very}} {{traditional}} craft and is practices {{in many of the}} communities of the state, although most of the wares produced are basic and meant for local consumption. These items include cooking pots, water <b>containers,</b> pitchers, candle <b>holders</b> and some sculptured decorative items. Most of these items have been made the same way since the pre-Hispanic period. The best quality ware is considered {{to be made in the}} central valleys in municipalities such as Zacualpan, Nuitzalapa, Atzacualoya, and others. Some areas have become specialized for certain types of pieces. The San Juan neighborhood of Chilapa make figures of a cerarmic which is glassy after firing. Acatlán makes ceramic toys, and Ometepec specializes in the making of very large cántaro jars, traditionally used for storage.|$|R
40|$|Napkin Holders Set {{comprises}} six napkin holders in {{sterling silver}} {{designed specifically for}} the exhibition ‘Fit for Purpose’ and bears the unique hallmarks for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee year. De Quin exhibited the object within a group show of contemporary silverwork by members of Contemporary British Silversmiths. De Quin’s piece represents her response to the exhibition title ‘Fit for Purpose’. The exhibition was displayed within the V&A’s Silver Galleries and was timed {{to coincide with the}} V&A’s major exhibition ‘British Design 1948 to 2012 : Innovation in the Modern Age’ (2012). ‘Fit For Purpose’ was designed to function as a complementary display. The object captures de Quin’s interest in exploring the traditional technique of chasing {{within the context of a}} design that considers the demands of functional tableware for contemporary dining. De Quin first used this technique in a one-off work, Tall and Small, in which decorative elements in non-precious metal are used as a passive device for considering the scale, proportion and orientation of two precious-metal vessels. The elements take the form of single curved walls, contrasting with the more complex form of the two <b>containers.</b> Napkin <b>Holders</b> Set uses chasing as both decorative and functional form. Containment offers an opening that requires the fit of a folded napkin to complete it within a table setting. Napkin Holders Set is given added dimension through the use of a hardwood stand which considers the practice of storage and offers additional opportunity for display when the pieces are not in use. This research extends the formal experiments of Enclosure (de Quin REF Output 3), bringing contemporary innovation to the more traditional silverware design of the V&A displays and collection. An exhibition catalogue, ‘Fit for Purpose: a practical & conceptual exploration of silver’, was published by Contemporary British Silversmiths (2012) ...|$|R
