30|$|Besides {{induction}} of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines, <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>DNAs</b> also {{induce the}} activation of inflammasomes that promote the maturation of IL- 1 β through caspase- 1. Inflammasome components NLRP 3 and ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain) {{were identified as}} DNA sensors (Muruve et al., 2008). Engulfed adenoviral DNA is detected by NLRP 3 and ASC, leading to maturation of pro-IL- 1 β in macrophages. Mice deficient of NLRP 3 or ASC impair innate inflammatory responses when challenged with adenovirus particles. The inflammasome can also be activated by cytosolic <b>DNAs</b> originated from <b>cytoplasmic</b> bacteria, viruses or even leaking host genomic <b>DNAs.</b> These <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>DNAs</b> are recognized by ASC but not NLRP 3, suggesting that the inflammasome components may {{have the ability to}} discern disparities among DNAs with different origins. By searching the PFAM database, a PYHIN family member protein absent in melanoma 2 (AIM 2) was identified as an intracellular DNA sensor that is essential for caspase- 1 activation (Burckstummer et al., 2009; Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2009; Hornung et al., 2009). AIM 2 binds dsDNA in a sequence-independent manner through its HIN 200 domain. AIM 2 then recruits ASC via its pyrin domain, leading to caspase- 1 and NFκB activation. AIM 2 knockdown suppresses caspase- 1 activation upon dsDNA stimulation.|$|R

40|$|Liver {{sections}} {{from five}} patients with persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and active cirrhosis {{were shown to}} contain intracellular HBV DNA by in situ hybridization using cloned 3 H-labelled HBV DNA probes. Two classes of infected cells, with different distributions throughout the liver, were distinguished: (i) cells containing a low copy number of double-stranded HBV nucleotide sequences, onfined to the cell nucleus and thought o represent HBV DNA, and (ii) cells containing large amounts (estimated to be greater than 10 or 15 genome copies per cell) of HBV DNA, {{much of it in}} a single-stranded form and largely confined to the cell cytoplasm; these single-stranded regions represented widely separated regions of the HBV genome, in contrast to the structure of the DNA in mature virions. It is likely that these latter cells may be supporting viral DNA synthesis. Cells with large amounts of <b>cytoplasmic</b> HBV <b>DNA</b> invariably contained hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and in addition contained either no detectable hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), or cytoplasmic HBcAg or nuclear HBcAg in that order of frequency.

50|$|There are two {{theories}} why the paternal mtDNA is not {{transmitted to}} the offspring. One is simply the fact that paternal mtDNA is at such a lower concentration than the maternal mtDNA and thus it is not detectable in the offspring.

50|$|The {{antiviral}} role of TRIM14 {{has also}} been confirmed by the inhibition of the selective autophagic degradation of the <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>DNA</b> sensor, cGAS.

50|$|Inheritance of {{extrachromosomal}} DNA {{differs from}} the inheritance of nuclear DNA found in chromosomes.

To investigate a relationship between rotavirus infection and cell death by apoptosis, we used the human intestinal Caco- 2 cell line.

Rotavirus infection leads to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria. We showed that rotavirus-induced apoptosis was dependent of the multiplicity of infection and increased with time from 4 h to 24 h of infection. Flow cytometric analysis showed that DNA fragmentation occurs in productively infected cells, suggesting that rotavirus induces apoptosis by a direct mechanism.
