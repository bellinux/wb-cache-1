5|$|A Sudoku with 24 <b>clues,</b> {{dihedral}} symmetry (symmetry on both orthogonal axis, 90° rotational symmetry, 180° rotational symmetry, and diagonal symmetry) {{is known}} to exist, and is also automorphic. Again here, {{it is not known}} if this number of <b>clues</b> is minimal for this class of Sudoku. The fewest <b>clues</b> in a Sudoku with two-way diagonal symmetry is believed to be 18, and in at least one case such a Sudoku also exhibits automorphism.|$|E
5|$|Many Sudokus {{have been}} found with 17 <b>clues,</b> {{although}} finding them is not a trivial task. A paper by Gary McGuire, Bastian Tugemann, and Gilles Civario, released on 1 January 2012, explains how it was proved through an exhaustive computer search that the minimum number of <b>clues</b> in any proper Sudoku is 17, and this was independently confirmed in September 2013. A few 17-clue puzzles with diagonal symmetry were provided by Ed Russell, after a search through equivalence transformations of Gordon Royle's database of 17-clue puzzles. Sudoku puzzles with 18 <b>clues</b> {{have been found}} with 180° rotational symmetry, and others with orthogonal symmetry, {{although it is not}} known if this number of <b>clues</b> is minimal in either case. Sudoku puzzles with 19 <b>clues</b> have been found with two-way orthogonal symmetry, and again it is unknown if this number of <b>clues</b> is minimal for this case.|$|E

5|$|Blue's <b>Clues</b> premiered in the U.S. on September 8, 1996. It was a smash hit, {{largely due}} to the producers'extensive research, and became crucial to Nickelodeon's growth. Within 18 months of its premiere, Blue's <b>Clues</b> was as {{well-known}} as more established children's shows such as the 30-year-old Sesame Street. It became the highest-rated show for preschoolers on commercial television. By 2002, 13.7 million viewers tuned in each week.|$|E

50|$|Two <b>Clue</b> Puzzles were {{available}} with {{the launch of}} the product, which, if solved, each give a piece position on the main 256-piece puzzle. <b>Clue</b> Puzzle 1 is 6 by 6, with 36 pieces and <b>Clue</b> Puzzle 2 is 12 by 6, with 72 pieces. Two further puzzles were made available in 2008. <b>Clue</b> Puzzle 3 is 6 by 6, with 36 pieces, and <b>Clue</b> Puzzle 4 is 12 by 6, with 72 pieces.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Clue</b> DVD Game is not {{the first}} <b>Clue</b> game to include an {{interactive}} component. It was preceded by a Parker Brothers game called the <b>Clue</b> VCR Mystery Game, which is now out-of-print and collectible. This precursor to the <b>Clue</b> DVD Game saw some popularity, because it spawned a sequel, called <b>Clue</b> II Murder in Disguise - A VCR Mystery Game. Both of these VCR games were published in the mid to late 1980's.|$|R

5|$|In sum number place (Samunampure), {{the regions}} are of {{irregular}} shape and various sizes. The usual constraints of no repeated value in any row, column or region apply. The <b>clues</b> are given as sums of values within regions (e.g. a 4-cell region with sum 10 must consist of values 1,2,3,4 in some order). The {{minimum number of}} <b>clues</b> for Samunampure is not known, nor even conjectured. A variant on Miyuki Misawa's web site replaces sums with relations: the <b>clues</b> are symbols =, < and > showing the relative values of (some but not all) adjacent region sums. She demonstrates an example with only eight relations. It is not known whether {{this is the best}} possible.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two examples, notice that if the Sudoku is rotated 180 degrees, and the <b>clues</b> relabeled with the {{permutation}} (123456789) -> (987654321), it returns to the same Sudoku. Expressed another way, these Sudokus have the property that every 180 degree rotational pair of <b>clues</b> (a, b) follows the rule (a) + (b) = 10.|$|E
5|$|Steve, the host, {{presents}} {{the audience with}} a puzzle involving Blue, the animated dog... To help the audience unlock the puzzle, Blue leaves behind a series of <b>clues,</b> which are objects marked {{with one of her}} paw prints. In between the discovery of the <b>clues,</b> Steve plays a series of games — mini-puzzles — with the audience that are thematically related to the overall puzzle... As the show unfolds, Steve and Blue move from one animated set to another, jumping through magical doorways, leading viewers on a journey of discovery, until, {{at the end of the}} story, Steve returns to the living room. There, at the climax of the show, he sits down in a comfortable chair to think — a chair known, of course, in the literal world of Blue's <b>Clues,</b> as the Thinking Chair. He puzzles over Blue's three <b>clues</b> and attempts to come up with the answer.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a general}} {{knowledge}} crossword game. The computer randomly selects the first <b>clue</b> to {{be presented to the}} contestants. The player who correctly answers each <b>clue</b> then chooses the next <b>clue</b> to be solved. If neither player can give a correct answer, the answer is revealed and the next <b>clue</b> is chosen randomly again.|$|R
5000|$|Any type of puzzle {{may contain}} cross-references, where the answerto one <b>clue</b> forms part of another <b>clue,</b> {{in which it}} is {{referred}} to by number and direction.

5000|$|Travel <b>Clue</b> Jr. (1994) Like {{the regular}} Travel <b>Clue</b> game, {{it is not}} merely a miniaturised version of the <b>Clue</b> Jr. series, but a unique format with its own set of rules.

5|$|The Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each {{of which}} {{contains}} five <b>clues,</b> which are ostensibly valued by difficulty. The dollar values of the <b>clues</b> increased over time. On the original Jeopardy! series, clue values {{in the first round}} ranged from $10 to $50. On The All-New Jeopardy!, they ranged from $25 to $125. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100 to $500, and were doubled to $200 to $1,000 on November 26, 2001. On the Super Jeopardy! specials, <b>clues</b> were valued in points rather than in dollars, and ranged in the first round from 200 to 1,000 points.|$|E
5|$|A {{large portion}} of {{gameplay}} in Murder on the Orient Express has the player questioning characters and listening to lengthy periods of dialogue in order to acquire <b>clues</b> which {{may lead to the}} murderer. Other tasks the player must complete include collecting passports and other paraphernalia left by the passengers in an effort to acquire <b>clues</b> to lead to the solution of the murder, and retrieving certain objects for various characters. Combining items in the inventory forms {{a major part of the}} puzzles in the game. There are no puzzles with time limits in the game, although some puzzles require correct timing. There are also several single screen puzzles, such as a safe-cracking puzzle.|$|E
5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate <b>clues</b> into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate <b>clues</b> to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E
5000|$|Some entries {{may either}} not be <b>clued</b> at all, or refer to another <b>clue</b> (e.g. 7 down may be <b>clued</b> as [...] "See 13 down" [...] if 13 down reads [...] "7 down plus 5") ...|$|R

5|$|Batman can {{investigate}} crimes such as murders, {{using his}} Detective Vision {{to reconstruct the}} crimes to locate <b>clues</b> and identify the perpetrators, or use his Tissue Scanner to investigate a victim's skin, muscle, and bones for <b>clues.</b> Completing the story mode unlocks a New Game Plus mode, enabling the player to replay the game {{with all of the}} gadgets, experience, abilities, and Riddler collectables that they have obtained. The completion of some tasks is reflected in the Gotham City Police Department, with thugs and supervillains becoming incarcerated, and criminal memorabilia from missions and previous games being collected in the evidence room.|$|E
5|$|Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski mailed or hand-delivered {{a series}} of {{increasingly}} sophisticated bombs that cumulatively killed three people and injured twenty-three.

5|$|In initial tests run during 2006 by David Ferrucci, {{the senior}} manager of IBM's Semantic Analysis and Integration department, Watson was given 500 <b>clues</b> from past Jeopardy! programs. While the best real-life {{competitors}} buzzed {{in half the}} time and responded correctly {{to as many as}} 95% of <b>clues,</b> Watson's first pass could get only about 15% correct. During 2007, the IBM team was given three to five years and a staff of 15 people to solve the problems. By 2008, the developers had advanced Watson such that it could compete with Jeopardy! champions. By February 2010, Watson could beat human Jeopardy! contestants on a regular basis.|$|E
