However, if the cooling system is neglected or improperly bled after filling - needing a raised filling level because the expansion tank is not the highest point in the system - the engine has a tendency to blow its head gasket.

40|$|Abstract-In {{studies to}} {{understand}} the mechanisms responsible for shock wave lithotrlpsy (SWL) cell injury, we observed that shock waves (SWs) {{are influenced by the}} shape of the specimen vial. Lytic injury to kidney cells treated in a Dornier HM 3 lithotripter was higher (p < 0. 0001) when SWs entered the vial through the flat end (<b>cap</b> <b>end)</b> compared to the round end. Measurements of the acoustic field within polypropylene vials were carried out using both lithotripter SWs and pulsed ultrasound (US) in the mega-hertz frequency range. We compared pressure amplitudes inside the round and flat vials and found signifi-cant differences. When SWs entered through the round end, the average peak positive pressure was 40 % of free-field pressure, due mostly to a dramatic reduction in pressure off axis. The average peak pressure inside the flat vial was twice that of the round vial. Experiments with US demonstrated that sound field focusing was induced by the curved interface of the round vial. Ray analysis for the round vial indicates the presence of “hot spots ” on axis and “cold spots ” off axis, in qualitative agreement with pressure profiles. We conclude that the shape of the specimen vial is an important factor that should be considered in model systems of SWL cell injury. 0 1997 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{validation}} of analytical model. The {{objective of this}} study was to validate existing analytical models of the friction force and leakage for O-ring seals at high pressure, where high pressure is defined as 2000 psi. A set of three pistons with 9, 6, and 4 mm bore were used in this experiment. Each piston had a single O-ring seal located in the <b>cap</b> <b>end.</b> To validate the friction force model, the force efficiency was measured by exerting a load on a piston and collecting pressure, load, and displacement measurements during constant piston descent. To validate the leakage model, a static leakage test was performed by measuring the displacement of the piston after being exposed to a constant load for an extended amount of time. Results indicated that the friction force efficiency model was valid for a range of pressures between 500 and 2000 psi, which indicates that the model for O-ring friction holds at high pressure. Results from the leakage test showed that the piston moved close to 600 microns during the first 12 hours of testing and did not move for the remaining 36 hours. This indicates that O-ring seals are leak-free, so the volumetric efficiency can be approximated to be 100 %. Simple O-ring seal models can be used to compute the overall efficiency of small-scale hydraulic systems at high pressure.

40|$|This study aims {{to advance}} {{understanding}} of baked-in siliconization of cartridges for application in Insulin injection pens. This research {{is motivated by}} {{lack of knowledge of}} baked-in siliconization and business opportunities a better understanding can provide. The primary contribution from this work is the development of a recommended silicone profile that can significantly reduce friction force variation within a cartridge during device use. An Insulin pen delivers Insulin to patients by the mechanical pushing of a rubber stopper through a cylindrical glass cartridge forcing the Insulin through a hypodermic needle at the <b>cap</b> <b>end.</b> This cartridge is coated with a very thin layer of silicone to reduce the force necessary for injection. This silicone layer is introduced to the cartridge prior to filling in the manufacturing process. This step of the filling process was characterized and results revealed different silicone profiles and friction force profiles for different filling lines. Correlations between silicone profile and friction forces were then developed for cartridges. As predicated, lower levels of silicone thickness and a higher percent of dry spots led to increased friction forces and higher variation among samples. These correlations were used to recommend a silicone profile with an average layer thickness greater than 60 nm with fewer than 20 % dry spots. Finally, atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) treatment was explored as a pre-treatment step to improve siliconization. Findings from APP feasibility studies showed that APP increases glass surface energy and wettability, but that its effect wears off over time and therefore impact on siliconization is still unknown. These results set the stage for further research and process optimization of siliconization in the context of medical injection devices. Insights gained will contribute to design of new devices, improved manufacturing operations and increased quality for Sanofi and the pharmaceutical medical device industry.
