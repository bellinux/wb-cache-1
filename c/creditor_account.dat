Tibble sat on a three-legged stool by him, writing in a crabbed hand, in a big ledger, and Kit Smallbones towered above both, holding in his hand a bundle of tally-sticks. By the help of these, and of that accuracy of memory which writing has destroyed, he was unfolding, down to the very last farthing, the entire account of payments and receipts during his master's absence, the debtor and <b>creditor</b> <b>account</b> being preserved as perfectly {{as if he had}} always had a pen in his huge fingers, and studied book- keeping by double or single entry.|$|E
60|$|Then {{came the}} making out the accounts, a matter dreaded {{by all the}} family. Ellen and Alfred both used to do the sums; but as they never made them the same, Mrs. King always went by some {{reckoning}} of her own by pencil dots on her thumb-nail, which took an enormous time, but never went wrong. So the slate and the books came up after tea, one night, and Ellen set {{to work with her}} mother to pick out every one's bill. There might be about eight customers who had Christmas bills; but many an accountant in a London shop would think eight hundred a less tough business than did the King family these eight; especially as there was a debtor and <b>creditor</b> <b>account</b> with four, and coals, butcher's meat, and shoes for man and horse, had to be set against bread, tea, candles, and the like.|$|E

Some of the craftiest scoundrels that ever walked this earth, or rather--for walking implies, at least, an erect position and the bearing of a man--that ever crawled and crept through life by its dirtiest and narrowest ways, will gravely jot down in diaries the events of every day, and keep a regular debtor and <b>creditor</b> <b>account</b> with Heaven, which shall always show a floating balance in their own favour. Whether this is a gratuitous (the only gratuitous) part of the falsehood and trickery of such men's lives, or whether they really hope to cheat Heaven itself, and lay up treasure in the next world by the same process which has enabled them to lay up treasure in this--not to question how it is, so it is. And, doubtless, such book-keeping (like certain autobiographies which have enlightened the world) cannot fail to prove serviceable, in the one respect of sparing the recording Angel some time and labour.|$|E

This represented a 20-percent increase of reserves over the previous year, largely the result of higher remittances by Bangladeshi workers abroad. The country also reduced imports by about 10 percent to US$2.4 billion. Because of Bangladesh's status as a least developed country receiving concessional loans, private <b>creditors</b> <b>accounted</b> for only about 6 percent of outstanding public debt.

Your first duty is to earn a livelihood for them and yourself; when you've done that satisfactorily, you may begin to think of the claims of humanity.

Mind, I don't say anything against Herr Schurz myself--what little I know about him is all in his favour--that he's a thorn in the side of those odious prigs, the political economists. I've often noticed that when a man wants to dogmatise to his heart's content without fear of contradiction, he invariably calls himself a political economist. Then if people differ from him, he smiles at them the benign smile of superior wisdom, and says superciliously, [...] "Ah, I see you don't understand political economy!" [...] Now, your Herr Schurz is a dissenter among economists, I believe--a sort of embryo Luther come to tilt with a German toy lance against their economical infallibilities; and I'm told he knows more about the subject than all the rest of them put together. Of course, if you like him and respect him--and I know you have one superstition left, my dear fellow--there's no reason on earth why you shouldn't do so; but you mustn't parade him too openly before the scandalised faces of respectable Pilbury.

This paper explores which user groups access online corporate sustainability information, and assesses the relative use of sustainability reports and other forms of social and environmental information disseminated on corporate Websites. To collect the necessary empirical data, the paper analyses 4, 652, 471 successful requests for information made by the users of 10 UK FTSE 350 corporate websites. The paper finds that the majority of requests for online sustainability information originate from the reporting company indicative of an inward focus to sustainability reporting. In examining access to different online information sets, distinct profiles of corporate Website users begin to emerge. Requests from employees, private individuals, ISPs and consultants represent {{the vast majority of the}} online sustainability reporting audience and the corporate website in general. Contrastingly, a professional financially-orientated profile of users characterised by professional investors, <b>creditors,</b> <b>accounting</b> firms and lawyers make significantly more use of the Annual Report but significantly less use of sustainability reporting information and other online disclosures. Although prior literature notes how companies have yet to utilise the potential of the online medium in disseminating corporate sustainability information, disclosures are found to attract approximately a tenth of all corporate website requests. Environmental and ethical disclosures outside the Annual Report are the most popular sources of online corporate sustainability information whilst ‘standalone’ Sustainability and/or Ethics Reports attract comparatively few requests...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use and users of {{narrative}} reporting information contained within the corporate annual reports published online by large listed companies on the London Stock Exchange. Broadly, the study was motivated by the increasing supply of narrative reporting information and management commentary in annual reports, {{and the lack of}} empirical research investigating {{the use and}} users of this information. More specifically, there has been little investigation into who uses information delivered online, and how the users and the information they request may differ from those using hard copy annual reports, particularly where many commentators believe the Internet will become the primary channel for disseminating annual reports in the future. The paper details over 1 million instances where narrative reporting and annual reporting information is successfully delivered to users of the corporate Web sites of 15 UK FTSE 350 companies representing 11 industrial sectors. The most frequent users of the online annual report are private individuals and those registered under ISP, employees and professional investors and creditors. Employees are found to make significantly greater use of narrative reporting information, yet they do not make comparatively greater use of management commentary, suggesting that their focus is aimed at less technical, more summarised information. Consultants and unaffiliated organisations make significantly greater use of narrative reporting information and management commentary, suggesting an interest in understanding the business while lacking an interest in, or comprehension of, financial accounting data. Professional investors and <b>creditors,</b> and <b>accounting</b> firms make significantly fewer requests for both narrative reporting information and management commentary. Overall, the key financial statements, notes and segmental analysis generate the most information requests and summarised, narrative reporting information tends to be more popular with online users than management commentary or more detailed narratives. The results suggest that those with greater experience and expertise in preparing and using financial accounts adopt different information preferences with respect to the online annual report. Although experienced users such as professional investors, <b>creditors</b> and <b>accounting</b> firms use the annual report to download predominantly detailed financial accounting data, the widespread availability and accessibility of the online annual report allows narratives to provide a source of general company information for employees and a wider audience, many of whom would have lacked access to a hard copy annual report...|$|R

5000|$|A {{preference}} in U.S. federal bankruptcy {{law is a}} transfer of property by a debtor to its <b>creditor,</b> on <b>account</b> of a pre-existing debt, that is made while the debtor is insolvent and gives the creditor more than it would obtain in a liquidation of the debtor's assets in a bankruptcy proceeding. It is primarily {{a creature of the}} U.S. Bankruptcy Code, although some states have similar state laws. If the preferential transaction takes place within a specified period of time before the filing of bankruptcy by or on behalf of the debtor, then the debtor's trustee in bankruptcy is authorized to recover the property preferentially transferred. The mechanism of recovery is the avoidance of the transfer. After such avoidance, the recovered property becomes property of the bankruptcy estate. The period is usually 90 days. However, if the preferential transfer is made to an [...] "insider," [...] then the period is one year. An [...] "insider" [...] is generally a relative or one who has the ability to control the activities of the debtor.
