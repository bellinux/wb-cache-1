50|$|The 4.43361875 MHz {{frequency}} of the <b>colour</b> <b>carrier</b> {{is a result of}} 283.75 colour clock cycles per line plus a 25 Hz offset to avoid interferences. Since the line frequency (number of lines per second) is 15625 Hz (625 lines × 50 Hz ÷ 2), the <b>colour</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency calculates as follows: 4.43361875 MHz = 283.75 × 15625 Hz + 25 Hz.|$|E
5000|$|Conversion to/from NTSC is easy, as {{only the}} <b>colour</b> <b>carrier</b> {{needs to be}} changed. Frame rate and scan lines can remain untouched.|$|E
50|$|PAL-M {{signals are}} {{identical}} to North American NTSC signals, {{except for the}} encoding of the <b>colour</b> <b>carrier.</b> Therefore, PAL-M will display in monochrome with sound on an NTSC set and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|Its natural {{waveform}} is {{a negative}} pulse of -40 IRE followed by 10 cycles of the <b>colour</b> sub <b>carrier</b> of video. For PAL video, {{the frequency of the}} sub carrier is 4.43361875MHZ.|$|R
50|$|Presentation {{time stamps}} have a {{resolution}} of 90kHz, suitable for the presentation synchronization task. The PCR or SCR has {{a resolution of}} 27MHz which is suitable for synchronization of a decoder's overall clock {{with that of the}} usual remote encoder, including driving TV signals such as frame and line sync timing, <b>colour</b> sub <b>carrier,</b> etc.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 January 2011, it was {{announced}} that Virgin Australia had established a 10-year alliance under which Skywest would operate up to 18 turboprops in the bigger <b>carrier's</b> <b>colours.</b> The alliance with the Perth-based airline was part of new push by Virgin Australia into regional Australia. The agreement saw the airlines codeshare on some of each other's flights. Virgin Australia and Skywest customers also could earn and redeem frequent flyer points on each other's networks. The aircraft were leased from [...] plc (...) with the first four arriving in 2011.|$|R
50|$|The PAL <b>colour</b> <b>carrier</b> is {{modulated}} {{making use}} of correlation between 2 fields, {{in order to give}} a cleaner Y/C separation in the PAL-plus receiver. It is used with signals with high horizontal luminance frequencies (3 MHz) that share the spectrum with the chrominance signals. Colour pictures on both standard and PAL Plus receivers are enhanced.|$|E
50|$|The W65C02S {{may also}} be {{operated}} at non-integral clock rates such as 13.5 MHz (digital SDTV luma sampling rate), 14.31818 MHz (NTSC <b>colour</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency × 4), 14.75 MHz (PAL square pixels), 14.7456 (baud rate crystal), etc., as long as VDD is sufficient to support the frequency. Designer Bill Mensch {{has pointed out that}} FMAX is affected by off-chip factors, such as the capacitive load on the microprocessor's pins. Minimizing load by using short signal tracks and fewest devices helps raise FMAX. The PLCC and QFP packages have less pin-to-pin capacitance than the PDIP package, and are more economical in the use of printed circuit board space.|$|E
50|$|In comparison, professional-level Betacam SP tape {{produces}} approx 440×486i/576i, {{and some}} college TV studios use Super VHS at ~560×486i/576i, {{along with an}} increased <b>colour</b> <b>carrier</b> bandwidth. Both of these systems, whilst showing a marked improvement over VHS, ultimately offer lower resolution images than DVD, but are still comparable to (and thus remain useful for) lower-bandwidth broadcast television, which is compromised in the analogue domain by a narrower available frequency range for each individual channel, and in the digital by a literally lower horizontal pixel count (often 480 or 544, versus the 720 of DVD and full-rate SDTV broadcasts). Again, both systems offer high motion and a high vertical resolution by way of interlacing, and are more justifiably counted as SD rather than LD.|$|E
40|$|The one-bath dyeing of blends of polytrimethylene {{terephthalate}} (PTT) staple and wool has been investigated. The exhaustion of selected Terasil disperse dyes on PTT fibre and Lanasol reactive dyes on wool was measured {{as a function}} of temperature, together with the cross-staining of the Terasil dyes on the wool component and the Lanasol dyes on PTT component. Most Terasil disperse dyes achieved satisfactory dye uptake on PTT at 110 °C, whereas on conventional polyester (polyethylene terephthalate) temperatures of up to 130 °C are required. An optimised union-dyeing technique for wool/PTT blends was developed which minimised the staining of Terasil disperse dyes on wool and produced dyed goods with high levels of wet <b>colour</b> fastness. <b>Carriers</b> were not required to enhance the dyeability of PTT at low temperatures. The wool component appeared to be protected against damage at 110 °C by the reactive dyes. The results indicate the potential for blending PTT fibre and wool to produce fabrics that are easier to dye at lower temperatures than conventional wool/polyester blends. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{dissertation}} is to study the awareness mechanisms in groupware computing. The object {{of this study is}} to create a platform for testing awareness mechanisms in a general and empirical fashion. The platform will allow different awareness schemes to be enabled and disabled as required. The awareness mechanisms that will be supported in this project are the use of <b>colour</b> as a <b>carrier</b> of embodiment information, the use of radars and telepointers to present location awareness information in the workspace, the use of landmarks as a shorthand for navigation and reference in a shared workspace, and finally the effect of different levels of communications on the tasks. This study will conduct a pilot trial with groups of 2 to 4 users to test the effectiveness of the platform developed. Preliminary results from these trials will be summarised...|$|R
40|$|A flow {{injection}} analysis {{system with}} a spectrophotometric detection was arranged {{in order to develop}} a simple and fast methodology for the quantification of titratable acidity in different types of wines. In the proposed system, a precise volume of sample is injected in the carrier stream, composed by a mixture of OH− solution with the pH indicator, bromothymol blue (BTB). Consequently, a change on the <b>colour</b> of the <b>carrier</b> solution is achieved and quantified by spectrophotometry. Therefore, it was possible to establish a linear range up to 0. 16 g/L expressed as tartaric acid, with a limit of detection and quantification of 0. 01 and 0. 05 g/L, respectively. The proposed work has a low sample and reagents consumption, only 96 μg of BTB, 336 mmol de OH− and 50 μL of sample were needed per assay. At the same time, a high determination rate was achieved, 75 determinations per hour. The developed methodology was applied on the quantification of total acidity in red and white table wine and port wine samples...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} <b>colour</b> <b>carrier</b> {{is required}} by the colour decoder to recreate the colour difference signals. Since the carrier is not transmitted with the video information {{it has to be}} generated locally in the receiver. In order that the phase of this locally generated signal can match the transmitted information, a 10 cycle burst of colour subcarrier is added to the video signal shortly after the line sync pulse, but before the picture information, during the so-called back porch. This colour burst is not actually in phase with the original colour subcarrier, but leads it by 45 degrees on the odd lines and lags it by 45 degrees on the even lines. This swinging burst enables the colour decoder circuitry to distinguish the phase of the R-Y vector which reverses every line.|$|E

Isolated microorganisms to be acclimated using Monochioromazynil compound and then pun fication process was canied out The result from purification of microorganisms is bacteria was named: Pseudomonas nidinensis and Pseudomonas diminuta. Biodegradation of Psedomonas rudinensis and Pseudornonas diminuta on red colour Monochiorotriazynil (Mkt) analysis using Gas Chromatography showed {{that both of}} bacteria where able to degrade red colour Mkta on aerobic condition. This condition was shown by degradation of Mkta concentration from initial concentration (. 10 mg/I, 25 mg/I. 50 mgI! and 75 mg/I). Over 108 hours reaction time on the both bacteria Biodegradation result analysis using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectra (GC-MS) showed series of Mkta biodegradation evens by breaking reactive ring and connecting ring that was done by. Psedomonas rudinensis in to 4 - Metoxyaniline. After the breakage of ring, the brekage of azo ring as a chromophore ring (<b>colour</b> <b>carrier)</b> into to compound, 2 Nahiumsulfonat 4 -Metoxyaniline and 2 Amino 3 -Natriumsulfonat AlfanaftoL This even was maxked by degradation of red colour.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the colour vision of 43 female subjects in the age range 30 - 59 yr of whom 31 were obligate carriers of various forms of colour deficiency and the rest were women who had no known colour-deficient relatives. In the case of all the carriers we established the phenotypes of their colourdeficient sons. As a group, carriers made significantly more errors on the Ishihara plates and showed enlarged matching ranges on the Nagel anomaloscope, but we could not replicate earlier reports of increased error scores on the Farnswo~Mu~ll 100 -Hue test or of systematic shifts in Rayleigh match mid-points. We did find that the <b>colour</b> matches of <b>carriers</b> of deuteranomaly were significantly displaced from those of normals in a ratio-matching task in which a mixture of 546 and 600 nm was matched {{with a mixture of}} 570 and 690 nm. Owing to X-chromosome inactivation, women who are heterozygous for anomalous trichromacy ought to have at least four types of cone in their retinae and we ask whether thii affords them an extra dime~ion of colour vision, by analogy to New World monkeys where ~te~zygous females gain triehromacy in a basically dichromatic species. Many carriers of anomalous trichromacy exhibited no evidence for tetrachromacy, in that they accepted large-field Rayleigh matches following a rod bleach and they were unable to set unique matches in our ratio-matching task. However, eight carriers o...|$|R
