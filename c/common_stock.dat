The transaction catapulted Steve Jobs, who was the majority shareholder of Pixar with 50.1%, to Disney's largest individual shareholder with 7% and a new seat on its board of directors. Jobs' new Disney holdings exceeded holdings belonging to ex-CEO Michael Eisner, the previous top shareholder, who still held 1.7%; and Disney Director Emeritus Roy E. Disney, who held almost 1% of the corporation's shares. Pixar shareholders received 2.3 shares of Disney <b>common</b> <b>stock</b> for each share of Pixar <b>common</b> <b>stock</b> redeemed.|$|E

5|$|Sociological {{reasoning}} pre-dates {{the foundation}} of the discipline. Social analysis has origins in the <b>common</b> <b>stock</b> of Western knowledge and philosophy, and has been carried out from {{as far back as the}} time of ancient Greek philosopher Plato, if not before. The origin of the survey, i.e., the collection of information from a sample of individuals, can be traced back to at least the Domesday Book in 1086, while ancient philosophers such as Confucius wrote on the importance of social roles. There is evidence of early sociology in medieval Arab writings. Some sources consider Ibn Khaldun, a 14th-century Arab Islamic scholar from North Africa (Tunisia), to have been the first sociologist and father of sociology (see Branches of the early Islamic philosophy); his Muqaddimah was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on social cohesion and social conflict.|$|E

40|$|Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) may be {{classified}} as a real estate investment or more generally as an equity investment. While REITs are more liquid than direct real estate investments, the liquidity relationship between REITs and <b>common</b> <b>stocks</b> is less clear-cut. This study measures and analyzes the liquidity differences between REITs and other <b>common</b> <b>stocks.</b> The intraday variations documented in this study have implications for: 1) the appropriate timing of trades to minimize transaction costs and, 2) the substitutability of investments if illiquidity is priced. Our results reveal intraday patterns indicating lower liquidity for REITs than for <b>common</b> <b>stocks</b> when the liquidity measure is friction-based. In contrast, activity measures exhibit higher liquidity levels for REITs than for <b>common</b> <b>stocks</b> but this difference is only statistically significant {{at the beginning of}} the trading day. Finally, from an economic perspective we find that the ability to trade without influencing prices is 15 - 25 % greater for non-REITS compared to REITs, and the price of immediacy is 7 % higher for REITs. ...|$|R
