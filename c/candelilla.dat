5000|$|<b>Candelilla</b> {{is gaining}} in {{popularity}} as a landscape plant {{in parts of}} the arid southwest. It is popular for the following reasons: ...|$|E
50|$|In 1914, W.K. Ellis and C.D. Wood {{established}} a wax factory on the embankment of Glenn Springs employing a {{population in the}} mountainous Chihuahuan Desert region. By 1916, the candelillero factory was composed of a boiler room with tall smoke stacks, six large extraction vats, and a water storage system {{for the production of}} <b>candelilla</b> wax.|$|E
50|$|It {{is mostly}} used mixed with other waxes to harden them without raising their melting point. As a food additive, <b>candelilla</b> wax has the E number E 902 {{and is used}} as a glazing agent. It also finds use in {{cosmetic}} industry, as a component of lip balms and lotion bars. One of its major uses is as a binder for chewing gums.|$|E
5000|$|With {{a melting}} point of 68.5-72.5 °C, <b>candelilla</b> wax {{consists}} of mainly hydrocarbons (about 50%, chains with 29-33 carbons), esters of higher molecular weight (20-29%), free acids (7-9%), and resins (12-14%, mainly triterpenoid esters). The high hydrocarbon content distinguishes this wax from carnauba wax. [...] It is insoluble in water, but soluble in many organic solvents such as acetone, chloroform, benzene, and Turpentine.|$|E
50|$|Lipstick {{contains}} wax, oils, antioxidants and emollients. Wax {{provides the}} structure to the solid lipstick. Lipsticks {{may be made}} from several waxes such as beeswax, ozokerite and <b>candelilla</b> wax. Because of its high melting point, Carnauba wax is a key ingredient in terms of strengthening the lipstick. Various oils and fats are used in lipsticks, such as olive oil, mineral oil, cocoa butter, lanolin, and petrolatum.|$|E
50|$|From {{the turn}} of the 20th century through World War II, the Terlingua Mining District was a boom town due to the {{extraction}} of cinnabar, a mercury ore, in the Chisos Mountains.Silver and lead from mines on the Mexican side of the river in the Boquillas area were shipped north, as were <b>candelilla</b> wax produced at factories at Glenn Spring and Mariscal and the guayule rubber from a factory in Marathon.|$|E
50|$|A {{wide range}} of {{emulsions}} based on different waxes and blends thereof are available, depending on the final application. Waxes that are found in wax emulsions can be of natural or synthetic origin. Common non-fossil natural waxes are carnaubawax, beeswax, <b>candelilla</b> wax or ricebran wax. Paraffin, microcrystalline and montanwax are the most used fossil natural waxes that are found in emulsions. Synthetic waxes that are used include (oxidised) LDPE and HDPE, maelic grafted PP and Fischer-Tropsch waxes.|$|E
50|$|Euphorbia antisyphilitica is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the spurge family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Trans-Pecos of Texas and southern New Mexico in the United States as well as Chihuahua, Coahuila, Hidalgo, and Querétaro in Mexico. Common names include <b>candelilla</b> and wax plant, but the latter is more often applied {{to members of the}} unrelated genus Hoya. It is shrubby and has densely clustered, erect, essentially leafless stems that are covered in wax to prevent transpiration.|$|E
5000|$|Magnolia poasana (known {{locally as}} the <b>Candelilla,</b> {{or by the}} common name Poas magnolia) is a sub-tropical to tropical, subcanopy tree, growing in areas of montane rainforest. The names [...] "Poas", and [...] "poasana" [...] {{originate}} from the Poás Volcano in Costa Rica where, along with Panama, they grow in the wild. First described by Henri François Pittier in 1910 (treated in the genus Talauma), it was later described and included in Magnolia by James Edgar Dandy (1927).|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, the nine-man cavalry squad, under Sgt. Charles E. Smyth, had {{abandoned}} their tents and taken up positions {{in an old}} adobe building. The skirmish that followed lasted for nearly three hours but eventually the rebels {{came up with a}} cunning idea to set fire to the roof of the adobe building, the roof of which was thatched with <b>candelilla</b> leaves. This forced the cavalrymen leave the structure and try to retreat to their horses, and it was during this time that three of the soldiers were killed and at least four others were either wounded or severely burned.|$|E
50|$|Plants secrete waxes {{into and}} {{on the surface of}} their cuticles as a way to control evaporation, {{wettability}} and hydration. The epicuticular waxes of plants are mixtures of substituted long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons, containing alkanes, alkyl esters, fatty acids, primary and secondary alcohols, diols, ketones, aldehydes. From the commercial perspective, the most important plant wax is carnauba wax, a hard wax obtained from the Brazilian palm Copernicia prunifera. Containing the ester myricyl cerotate, it has many applications, such as confectionery and other food coatings, car and furniture polish, floss coating, and surfboard wax. Other more specialized vegetable waxes include <b>candelilla</b> wax and ouricury wax.|$|E
50|$|Herbaceous plants, such as bush muhly (Muhlenbergia porteri), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), gypsum grama (B. breviseta), and hairy grama (B. hirsuta), are {{dominant}} in desert grasslands {{and near the}} mountain edges including the Sierra Madre Occidental. Lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), Opuntia macrocentra and Echinocereus pectinatus are the dominant species in western Coahuila. Ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens), lechuguilla, and Yucca filifera {{are the most common}} species in the southeastern part of the desert. <b>Candelilla</b> (Euphorbia antisyphilitica), Mimosa zygophylla, Acacia glandulifera and lechuguilla are found in areas with well-draining, shallow soils. The shrubs found near the Sierra Madre Oriental are exclusively lechuguilla, guapilla (Hechtia glomerata), Queen Victoria's agave (Agave victoriae-reginae), sotol (Dasylirion spp.), and barreta (Helietta parvifolia), while the well-developed herbaceous layer includes grasses, legumes and cacti.|$|E
5000|$|Boquillas and Glenn Springs {{were just}} small {{settlements}} at the time, about 12 miles apart, and only nine {{soldiers from the}} 14th Cavalry guarded at the former and none at the latter. Glenn Springs was located just south of Chilicotal Mountain and centered around a small spring named after the first settler in the area who was killed at the site by Comanches. The town was home to some 80 people, who were employed mainly by a <b>candelilla</b> wax factory, owned by [...] "Captain" [...] C.D. Wood and W.K. Ellis. The Ellis family also owned the general store, which was managed by C.G. Compton and his family. The inhabitants, who were mostly Mexican-Americans, lived in a [...] "scattered" [...] neighborhood of about 50 jacales concentrated {{at one end of}} town. Boquillas was even smaller than Glenn Springs. Located along the Rio Grande, across from the mining town of Del Carmen, Boquillas had a general store, owned by Jesse Deemer, and several jacales.|$|E
50|$|Vegetation in {{this region}} {{consists}} of several types of desert bushes, Huisache (Vachellia farnesiana var. farnesiana), mesquite (Prosopis spp.), Echinocereus enneacanthus, Opuntia spp., as well as Lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), Sotol (Dasylirion texanum) are abundant throughout the municipality, {{and there are several}} endemic plants, among them are <b>Candelilla</b> (Euphorbia antisyphilitica), Damiana (Turnera diffusa), La Gobernadora (Larrea tridentata), Hojasen (Flourensia cernua), Mariola (Parthenium incanum) and many other which have been less studied.

According to recent excavations in the ejido Boca de potrerillos in this municipality, have been found at twelve meters underground, several rests of carbonized nogal, willow and several types of pine which contrasts with the present-day plants abundant in Boca de Potrerillos, which is predominantly desert, carbon 14 tests, pointed out the rests go back several centuries ago, this is an evidence about how vegetation and ecosystem has been changing through the years.|$|E
40|$|The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources {{added to}} Food (ANS) {{delivers}} a scientific opinion re-evaluating {{the safety of}} <b>candelilla</b> wax (E 902). <b>Candelilla</b> wax (E 902) is authorised in the EU as a food additive as a glazing agent. It has been evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The JECFA and the SCF did not establish an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) but considered the use of <b>candelilla</b> wax as a glazing agent acceptable. <b>Candelilla</b> wax is obtained from leaves of <b>candelilla</b> plants Euphorbia antisyphilitica found in semi-desert regions. It is a complex mixture composed of wax hydrocarbons, wax, resin esters, lactones, free wax resin alcohols, and free wax resin acids. The Panel considered that absorption of <b>candelilla</b> wax {{is expected to be}} low, and that upon absorption the components would be incorporated into normal metabolic pathways. The Panel noted that there were limited data comparing the composition of the <b>candelilla</b> wax tested with the specification of the food additive. However the Panel considered that the materials tested were likely to be broadly similar in composition to the food additive. Overall, the Panel considered that the available data suggest that <b>candelilla</b> wax is not genotoxic. The Panel considered that long-term toxicity data on <b>candelilla</b> wax were lacking and therefore did not establish an ADI. However, the Panel noted that available toxicity studies consistently reported no findings associated with intake of the main components constituting <b>candelilla</b> wax. Furthermore, consideration of the exposure estimates to <b>candelilla</b> wax, using the Maximum Permitted Level (MPL) of carnauba wax, indicated sufficient margins of safety. This allowed the Panel to conclude that the use of <b>candelilla</b> wax as a food additive with the currently authorised uses would not be of safety concern...|$|E
40|$|Wax-based edible {{coatings}} for strawberry fruit were formulated and optimized. The {{weight loss}} was the preliminary quality parameter {{for determining the}} appropriate composition of the waxbased coating. Different combinations of wax to coconut oil ratio and amount of ethanol were performed to create a coating solution {{that would result in}} reduction of the weight loss while giving a desirable appearance. After conducting the preliminary study, it was concluded that the combination of 4 wax: 1 coconut oil in 70 mL ethanol was the best combination in order to significantly reduce the weight loss. Beewax and <b>candelilla</b> wax were used as the wax-basis, with coconut oil in the ratio 4 : 1. Both types of coating were applied onto strawberry fruits and these were evaluated for weight loss, surface color, ascorbic acid content, decay incidence, yeasts and mold count. A sensory evaluation was also performed. Strawberries were stored for 10 days at 10 ºC. Both wax-based coatings produced significant reduction in weight loss in comparison to the uncoated fruits. Furthermore, a significant decrease of 20 % and 15 % in the reduction of ascorbic acid was noted on the 7 th day of storage, for beewax - coconut oil coating and <b>candelilla</b> wax - coconut oil coating, respectively. The presence of mycelial growth often dictates the shelf-life of the strawberry fruit. In this study, a significant reduction in the decay incidence was observed both in beewax-coconut oil and <b>candelilla</b> wax-coconut oil coating. This was further supported by the lower yeast and mold count obtained for the coatings used. The changes in color between coated and uncoated fruits were not significantly different except for the L*value with higher values for coated fruits. In the sensory evaluation of the uncoated and coated fruits, judges also distinguished the color between the control and the treated fruits, after two days of storage at 4 ºC. Significant differences were also noticed between fruits coated with <b>candelilla</b> wax- coconut oil and the control, regarding other sensory parameters. However, there were not significant differences between beewax-coconut oil based coating and the uncoated fruits. Edible wax-based coating of beewax-coconut oil and <b>candelilla</b> wax-coconut oil could help to extend the shelf life of strawberry since after 10 days of storage the yeasts and molds count was 4. 0 × 105 cfu/g and 5. 3 × 105 cfu/g for beewax-based and <b>candelilla</b> wax-based coated samples, respectively, lower than 9. 4 × 107 cfu/g for the uncoated ones. However, those counts are still high, indicating a shelf life of beewax-based and <b>candelilla</b> wax-based coated strawberries shorter than 10 days...|$|E
40|$|The oleogels of {{canola oil}} with <b>candelilla</b> wax were {{prepared}} and utilized as a shortening replacer to produce cookies {{with a high}} level of unsaturated fatty acids. The incorporation of <b>candelilla</b> wax (3 % and 6 % by weight) to canola oil produced the oleogels with solid-like properties. The firmness of the oleogels was lower than that of the shortening at room temperature. A more rapid change in the viscosity with temperature was observed with increasing levels of <b>candelilla</b> wax in the steady shear measurements. The replacement of shortening with oleogels in the cookie formulation reduced both viscoelastic parameters (G′ and G″) of the cookie doughs. The level of unsaturated fatty acids in the oleogel cookies was distinctly increased up to around 92 %, compared to the shortening cookies (47. 2 %). The cookies with the oleogels showed desirable spreadable property and the replacement of shortening with the oleogels produced cookies with soft eating characteristics. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|An edible coating {{functionalized}} with pomegranate polyphenols was designed. Different blends of <b>candelilla</b> wax, gum arabic, jojoba oil, and pomegranate polyphenols were {{formulated in}} order to improve the shelf life quality of pears (variety Bartlett), and all formulations were applied by immersion onto the fruit surface. Coated pears with and without polyphenols and uncoated pears (control) were stored under the same conditions. Fruits were analyzed to evaluate changes in their physicochemical, microbiological, and sensorial properties during 30 days of storage at room temperature. Coated pears coded as T 13 (<b>candelilla</b> wax 3 %, gum arabic 4 %, jojoba oil 0. 15 %, and pomegranate polyphenols 0. 015 %) extended and improved their shelf life quality due to the minimization of the physic-chemical changes and sensorial properties.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} {{addition}} of ellagic acid (at three different concentrations) into <b>candelilla</b> wax matrix on shelf life and quality of whole avocados was studied. Control treatments were avocados coated with <b>candelilla</b> wax without ellagic acid and avocados without coating. The fruits were chosen for their maturity, size, free from infection and physical defects. All those samples were inoculated with a concentrated suspension of spores of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, the main phytopathogenic fungus for avocados. Experiments were carried out completely divided into randomized groups. Changes in appearance, solids content, pH, aw, lightness (L* value) and weight loss were monitored during 6 weeks every 8 days. A sensory evaluation of avocados coated with the best edible film was also performed. Edibel films were able to reduce significantly {{the damage caused by}} C. gloeosporioides, reducing also significantly the change in appearance and weight loss in the fruits. Use of ellagic acid as part of the edible film has an important effect to improve the quality and shelf life of avocado.

40|$|Pichia guilliermondii strain Z 1, {{which was}} {{previously}} {{proven to be}} effective against blue mold of citrus fruit, has been further tested in controlled conditions {{to determine whether the}} yeast, as an alternative for synthetic fungicides, would be compatible with other postharvest practices used commercially. In particular, commercial fruit waxes can reduce their survival and effectiveness. The commercial fruit waxes tested, in combination at 20 % with strain Z 1, included microcrystalline, ester gum, <b>candelilla,</b> beeswax, montan, paraffin, rice bran, rosin maleic, carnauba, shellac, and one mixture shellac plus carnauba. Beeswax, paraffin, rosin maleic, carnauba, and shellac increased significantly strain Z 1 survival in Petri dish assays. <b>Candelilla,</b> beeswax, rice bran, rosin maleic, carnauba, shellac, and shellacecarnauba mixture did not significantly reduce the strain Z 1 yield on orange fruit surfaces compared to other waxes. With the exception of rosin maleic wax, none of the commercial fruit waxes or mixture increased significantly the ability of the formulated product of strain Z 1 to control the postharvest pathogen Penicillium italicum on wounded orange fruit. When the formulated product of strain Z 1 was used in combination with beeswax, strain Z 1 retained the same efficacy. In contrast, microcrystalline, ester gum, <b>candelilla,</b> montan, paraffin, rice bran, carnauba, shellac, and shellac-carnauba mixture significantly reduced the effectiveness of the formulated product of strain Z 1. No antibiosis was detected for strain Z 1 against P. italicum. Strain Z 1 inhibited the spore germination for the low juice concentration (up to 5 %) when compared to the control. However, the addition of fresh juice after antagonist removal allowed the restoration of the germination of P. italicum spores; suggesting the possibility of competition for nutrients in the biocontrol activity of strain Z 1. The study demonstrates the potential commercial application of strain Z 1 with beeswax and rosin maleic wax for postharvest control of citrus blue mold.

40|$|The D-optimal mixture {{experimental}} design {{was employed to}} optimize the melting point of natural lipstick based on pitaya (Hylocereus polyrhizus) seed oil. The influence of the main lipstick components—pitaya seed oil (10 %– 25 % w/w), virgin coconut oil (25 %– 45 % w/w), beeswax (5 %– 25 % w/w), <b>candelilla</b> wax (1 %– 5 % w/w) and carnauba wax (1 %– 5 % w/w) —were investigated {{with respect to the}} melting point properties of the lipstick formulation. The D-optimal mixture {{experimental design}} was applied to optimize the properties of lipstick by focusing on the melting point with respect to the above influencing components. The D-optimal mixture design analysis showed that the variation in the response (melting point) could be depicted as a quadratic function of the main components of the lipstick. The best combination of each significant factor determined by the D-optimal mixture design was established to be pitaya seed oil (25 % w/w), virgin coconut oil (37 % w/w), beeswax (17 % w/w), <b>candelilla</b> wax (2 % w/w) and carnauba wax (2 % w/w). With respect to these factors, the 46. 0 °C melting point property was observed experimentally, similar to the theoretical prediction of 46. 5 °C.
