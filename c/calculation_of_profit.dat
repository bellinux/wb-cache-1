6000|$|In {{that great}} war carried on against Louis the Fourteenth for near {{eighteen}} years, government spared no pains {{to satisfy the}} nation, that, though {{they were to be}} animated by a desire of glory, glory was not their ultimate object; but that everything dear to them, in religion, in law, in liberty, everything which as freemen, as Englishmen, and as citizens of the great commonwealth of Christendom, they had at heart, was then at stake. This was to know the true art of gaining the affections and confidence of an high-minded people; this was to understand human nature. A danger to avert a danger, a present inconvenience and suffering to prevent a foreseen future and a worse calamity,--these are the motives that belong to an animal who in his constitution is at once adventurous and provident, circumspect and daring,--whom his Creator has made, as the poet says, [...] "of large discourse, looking before and after." [...] But never can a vehement and sustained spirit of fortitude be kindled in a people by a war of calculation. It has nothing that can keep the mind erect under the gusts of adversity. Even where men are willing, as sometimes they are, to barter their blood for lucre, to hazard their safety for the gratification of their avarice, the passion which animates them to that sort of conflict, like all the shortsighted passions, must see its objects distinct and near at hand. The passions of the lower order are hungry and impatient. Speculative plunder,--contingent spoil,--future, long adjourned, uncertain booty,--pillage which must enrich a late posterity, and which possibly may not reach to posterity at all,--these, for any length of time, will never support a mercenary war. The people are in the right. The <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> in all such wars is false. On balancing the account of such wars, ten thousand hogsheads of sugar are purchased at ten thousand times their price. The blood of man should never be shed but to redeem the blood of man. It is well shed for our family, for our friends, for our God, for our country, for our kind. The rest is vanity; the rest is crime.|$|E

Profit management, he argued, {{is the most}} effective method of organization when the services rendered may be checked by economic <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> and loss. When, however, the service in question can not be subjected to economic calculation, bureaucratic management is necessary. He did not oppose universally bureaucratic management; on the contrary, he argued that bureaucracy is an indispensable method for social organization, for it is the only method by which the law can be made supreme, and is the protector of the individual against despotic arbitrariness. Using the example of the Catholic Church, he pointed out that bureaucracy is only appropriate for an organization whose code of conduct is not subject to change. He then went on to argue that complaints about bureaucratization usually refer not to the criticism of the bureaucratic methods themselves, but to [...] "the intrusion of bureaucracy into all spheres of human life." [...] Mises saw bureaucratic processes at work in both the private and public spheres; however, he believed that bureaucratization in the private sphere could only occur as a consequence of government interference. According to him, [...] "What must be realized is only that the strait jacket of bureaucratic organization paralyzes the individual's initiative, while within the capitalist market society an innovator still has a chance to succeed. The former makes for stagnation and preservation of inveterate methods, the latter makes for progress and improvement." ...|$|E

We see that institutions are central to growth, poverty alleviation, and sustainability. We also see that economic growth – increases in per capita GDP (or GNP) – is not sufficient unless it is also accompanied by a simultaneous and plausibly sustainable decrease in social inequality, and unless growth is not destructive of future growth and development. The process of economic development must incorporate three central ideas. These concepts concern ethics, law, and economics. Ethics concern collective perceptions of what is good and just not only in the present, but in terms of objectives to be pursued in the future. Law concern the application of the collective power to mediate and to enforce that ethical consensus – always with an eye to the future.

John's {{marriage}} to Elizabeth Livingstone had been determined by the usual <b>calculations</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> and position, as were those of other important people of the time. There was one important difference with the alliance of John and Elizabeth: he came from a great landed family, she did not. Elizabeth was the daughter of Sir James Livingstone, a powerful politician during the minority of James II, but in a conservative, land-based society, a figure of no lasting significance. John, with a large and hungry following at his heels, rich as he was, always needed more land. Sir James' power was purely personal, and his daughter would not normally have been considered as a suitable match for the Lord of the Isles. It seems he was persuaded to marry her after certain unspecified promises from the king. After Livingstone fell from power in the early 1450s James refused to honour these promises. Instead of growing to love or at least respect Elizabeth, John came to loathe her.|$|R
