60|$|This {{conversation}} {{was held in}} open sea, where everything seems possible, some hundred miles from Southampton. We passed the Needles Light at dawn, and the lifting day showed the stucco villas on the green and the awful orderliness of England--line upon line, wall upon wall, solid stone dock and monolithic pier. We waited {{an hour in the}} <b>Customs</b> <b>shed,</b> and there was ample time for the effect to soak in.|$|E
60|$|The usual drove of {{citizens}} {{had come to}} see the travellers off. There were men on the passenger-list who were being seen off by fathers, by mothers, by sisters, by cousins, and by aunts. In the steerage there was an elderly Jewish lady who was being seen off by exactly thirty-seven of her late neighbours in Rivington Street. And two men in the second cabin were being seen off by detectives, surely the crowning compliment a great nation can bestow. The cavernous <b>customs</b> <b>shed</b> was congested with friends and relatives, and Sam Marlowe, heading for the gang-plank, was only able to make progress by employing all the muscle and energy which Nature had bestowed upon him, and which during the twenty-five years of his life he had developed by athletic exercise. However, after some minutes of silent endeavour, now driving his shoulder into the midriff of some obstructing male, now courteously lifting some stout female off his feet, he had succeeded in struggling to within a few yards of his goal, when suddenly a sharp pain shot through his right arm and he spun round with a cry.|$|E
50|$|Those ring {{leaders who}} had been in the <b>customs</b> <b>shed</b> were {{confined}} aboard the troop ship. Some other ring leaders were holding out in nearby huts and Trenchard obtained firehoses and had the windows of the huts smashed. The remaining ring leaders were then drenched in ice-cold water and they surrendered and were detained aboard the troop ship.|$|E
500|$|Approximately 500 Zanzibari men {{and women}} were killed or wounded during the bombardment, most of the dead a result of the fire that engulfed the palace. It is unknown how many of these {{casualties}} were combatants, but Khalid's gun crews were said to have been [...] "decimated". British casualties amounted to one Petty Officer severely wounded aboard Thrush who later recovered. Although the majority of the Zanzibari townspeople sided with the British, the town's Indian quarter suffered from opportunistic looting, and around twenty inhabitants lost their lives in the chaos. To restore order, 150 British Sikh troops were transferred from Mombasa to patrol the streets. Sailors from St George and Philomel were landed to form a fire brigade to contain the fire, which had spread from the palace to the nearby <b>customs</b> <b>sheds.</b> There was some concern about the fire at the <b>customs</b> <b>sheds</b> as they contained a sizeable store of explosives, but no explosion occurred.|$|R
60|$|She had {{finished}} unpacking and tidying up. The next move was certainly {{to go and}} see Ginger. She had suddenly become aware that she wanted very badly to see Ginger. His stolid friendliness would be a support and a prop. She wished now that she had sent him a cable, so that he could have met her at the dock. It had been rather terrible at the dock. The echoing <b>customs</b> <b>sheds</b> had sapped her valour and she felt alone and forlorn.|$|R

50|$|After {{the troops}} arrived, Trenchard {{spoke to the}} men, {{explaining}} his plan and issuing ammunition. On Trenchard's orders, the armed troops surrounded the open front of the huge <b>customs</b> <b>shed</b> where the mutinying soldiers were gathered. Trenchard ordered the men to load and make ready. Trenchard called on the mutineers to surrender and in response a sergeant shouted obscenities. Trenchard's military policemen arrested the sergeant {{and none of the}} sergeant's fellow mutineers resisted. Trenchard re-issued his call for submission and the crowd gave their assent.|$|E
50|$|An ever {{increasing}} number of passengers travelled in happier circumstances on the great liners of the day. The RMS Queen Mary for instance presented problems in quickly clearing large numbers of passengers {{and to do so}} within Victorian <b>Customs</b> <b>Sheds</b> was increasingly impractical. Shipping companies invited a, no doubt very agreeable, solution whereby Immigration Officers travelled 1st class on the liner itself or pre-cleared passengers in Cherbourg. In 1936 air traffic had grown {{to such an extent that}} a Chief Immigration Officer was appointed to take charge at Croydon Airport with additional responsibilities for immigration control in the new Gatwick terminal. which, with its very own direct rail link to London and art deco architecture was the last word in airport design until it was replaced in the 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|Masindi Hotel {{was built}} in 1923 by the now defunct East Africa Railways and Harbours Company. It is Uganda’s oldest hotel. [...] Masindi was a transit point for many goods and produce from the Northern Congo and Southern Sudan destined for export to European markets in the early 20th century. Cargo was shipped across Lake Albert, trucked from Butiaba up to Masindi <b>Customs</b> <b>Sheds.</b> From Masindi, goods were trucked on to Masindi Port on to Lake Kyoga where it was shipped down to Soroti and then by railway to Mombasa. Ernest Hemingway was {{involved}} in two plane crashes at Murchison Falls and Butiaba airstrip, within the space of one week. Hemingway recovered at Masindi Hotel. Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn stayed at Masindi Hotel whilst filming The African Queen at Masindi Port.|$|R
50|$|The first {{diesel engines}} (from the Yorkshire Engine Company) {{appeared}} in 1959 {{and a handful}} of steam engines were retained until 1963 (mainly for the banana traffic). The reign of the diesels was short lived as the docks were in rapid decline and on 1 May 1970 the PLA system and <b>Custom</b> House <b>shed</b> closed.|$|R

"I know no harder {{practical}} question {{than how}} much selfishness one ought to stand from a gifted {{person for the}} sake of his gifts or on the chance of his being right in the long run. The Superman will certainly come like a thief in the night, and be shot at accordingly; but we cannot leave our property wholly undefended on that account. On the other hand, we cannot ask the Superman simply to add a higher set of virtues to current respectable morals; for he is undoubtedly going to empty a good deal of respectable morality out like so much dirty water, and replace it by new and strange <b>customs,</b> <b>shedding</b> old obligations and accepting new and heavier ones. Every step of his progress must horrify conventional people; and if it were possible for even the most superior man to march ahead all the time, every pioneer of the march towards the Superman would be crucified." ...|$|R

50|$|Heavenly-related <b>customs</b> also <b>shed</b> {{more light}} on this issue. In this regard, Dirir, Ayaan and Xiddig, have become strong icons in the general culture. Some {{economic}} or life events, such as one’s fortune or birth, are marked by the movement of certain stars. The extended, common personal and place names by these terms across the nation20 reflect the deep rootedness of these customs. Although some of these customs are not permitted in the Islamic faith, their persistence within the Islamic culture shows their importance in the daily life of pre-Islamic society, which in turn indicates {{the age of the}} calendar.|$|R

It appears that he and the others had taught their families some English.|$|R
500|$|It is {{estimated}} that at least 100people lost their lives, mostly due to mudslides, including five persons in Havana. However, reports range as high as 700. [...] Initial estimates of the financial damage caused by the storm were in the millions of dollars, including losses of $1 million in Havana, largely from the destruction of <b>Customs</b> House <b>sheds</b> there, which were filled with many valuable goods. Some of these buildings were swept [...] away, and the winds tore the roof off the main warehouse. In the aftermath—while the hurricane was still widely considered to be two separate storms—rumors arose [...] "of the approach of a third storm", although in actuality no additional storms were known to {{have occurred in the}} 1910season.|$|R
50|$|A very learned Jew, who {{in our day}} {{has been}} {{converted}} to the (Christian) faith, informs us that one enjoying the reputation of a prophet among them, toward the close of his life, made the following prediction: 'Be assured that relief from this secret ailment, to which you are exposed, can only be obtained through Christian blood ("solo sanguine Christiano").' This suggestion {{was followed by the}} ever-blind and impious Jews, who instituted the <b>custom</b> of annually <b>shedding</b> Christian blood in every province, in order that they might recover from their malady.|$|R
40|$|International audienceCombining urban {{sociolinguistics}} (Calvet, 1994; Gasquet-Cyrus, 2002), critical sociolinguistics (Blommaert, 2005; 2010; Boutet & Heller, 2007) and ethnographic approaches, {{this text}} focuses {{on how the}} social and urban changes occurring in Marseille {{since the beginning of}} the 21 st century are shaping both an ongoing linguistic change and latent or manifest urban conflicts, where the issues of language are above all issues of identity and power. As France's second largest town and the European Capital of Culture in 2013, Marseille is well-known for what is considered the most famous accent in the country, the so-called 'Marseille (working-class) accent', prototype of the 'Southern' or 'Provençal' accent and often opposed to a more affected or stiff 'Parisian' accent (Kuiper, 2005). But beyond the traditional centre-periphery rivalry, internal conflicts in Marseille are revealing of more complex sociolinguistic issues. Previous studies have outlined the existence of at least three “accents” associated with specific areas of the town (Binisti & Gasquet-Cyrus, 2003) and with different symbolic values already into conflict (Gasquet-Cyrus, 2009). But very recently, urban policies aiming at the regeneration of the inner-city have attracted new inhabitants, whose socio-cultural and socio-economic profiles unbalance the traditional sociolinguistic patterns. The emergence of a new category of city-dwellers, the 'neo-Marseillais', associated with a “new way” of speaking challenging local <b>customs,</b> has <b>shed</b> light on new processes of perception, linguistic change and urban conflict. These different urban language conflicts will be reviewed, and particular attention will be paid to the process of gentrification of space and its linguistic correlates, i. e. “gentrification of speech” (Trimaille & Gasquet-Cyrus, in press), and to the agonistic dimension of these contacts. Finally, the paper will argue for a theoretical framework combining urban sociolinguistics and critical sociolinguistics in order to raise —through the study of linguistic change and conflicts in urban setting— issues of identity and power...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{and mining}} {{real-time}} network data streams are crucial operations for managing and operating data networks. The information that network operators desire to extract from the network traffic is of different size, granularity and accuracy {{depending on the}} measurement task (e. g., relevant data for capacity planning and intrusion detection are very different). To satisfy these different demands, {{a new class of}} monitoring systems is emerging to handle multiple and arbitrary monitoring applications. Such systems must inevitably cope with the effects of continuous overload situations due to the large volumes, high data rates and bursty nature of the network traffic. These overload situations can severely compromise the accuracy and effectiveness of monitoring systems, when their results are most valuable to network operators. In this thesis, we propose a technique called load shedding as an effective and low-cost alternative to over-provisioning in network monitoring systems. It allows these systems to handle efficiently overload situations in the presence of multiple, arbitrary and competing monitoring applications. We present the design and evaluation of a predictive load shedding scheme that can shed excess load in front of extreme traffic conditions and maintain the accuracy of the monitoring applications within bounds defined by end users, while assuring a fair allocation of computing resources to non-cooperative applications. The main novelty of our scheme is that it considers monitoring applications as black boxes, with arbitrary (and highly variable) input traffic and processing cost. Without any explicit knowledge of the application internals, the proposed scheme extracts a set of features from the traffic streams to build an on-line prediction model of the resource requirements of each monitoring application, which is used to anticipate overload situations and control the overall resource usage by sampling the input packet streams. This way, the monitoring system preserves a high degree of flexibility, increasing the range of applications and network scenarios where it can be used. Since not all monitoring applications are robust against sampling, we then extend our load shedding scheme to support <b>custom</b> load <b>shedding</b> methods defined by end users, in order to provide a generic solution for arbitrary monitoring applications. Our scheme allows the monitoring system to safely delegate the task of shedding excess load to the applications and still guarantee fairness of service with non-cooperative users. We implemented our load shedding scheme in an existing network monitoring system and deployed it in a research ISP network. We present experimental evidence of the performance and robustness of our system with several concurrent monitoring applications during long-lived executions and using real-world traffic traces.
