25|$|Another Englishman, John Mervin Nooth, {{improved}} Priestley's {{design and}} sold his apparatus for commercial use in pharmacies. Swedish chemist Torbern Bergman invented a generating apparatus that made <b>carbonated</b> <b>water</b> from chalk {{by the use}} of sulfuric acid. Bergman's apparatus allowed imitation mineral water to be produced in large amounts. Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius started to add flavors (spices, juices, and wine) to <b>carbonated</b> <b>water</b> in the late eighteenth century.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, {{scientists}} made important progress in replicating naturally carbonated mineral waters. In 1767, Englishman Joseph Priestley first discovered {{a method of}} infusing water with carbon dioxide to make <b>carbonated</b> <b>water</b> when he suspended a bowl of distilled water above a beer vat at a local brewery in Leeds, England. His invention of <b>carbonated</b> <b>water</b> (also known as soda water) is the major and defining component of most soft drinks.|$|E
25|$|Soft {{drinks are}} made by mixing dry or fresh {{ingredients}} with water. Production of soft drinks can be done at factories or at home. Soft drinks can be made at home by mixing a syrup or dry ingredients with <b>carbonated</b> <b>water,</b> or by lacto-fermentation. Syrups are commercially sold by companies such as Soda-Club; dry ingredients are often sold in pouches, in a style of the popular U.S. drink mix Kool-Aid. <b>Carbonated</b> <b>water</b> is made using a soda siphon or a home carbonation system or by dropping dry ice into water.|$|E

50|$|In 2006, Antipodes {{was named}} the best-tasting <b>carbonated</b> bottled <b>water</b> by the Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting. In 2012, it won a silver in the <b>carbonated</b> bottled <b>water</b> {{category}} at the same awards.|$|R
25|$|SodaStream {{can only}} {{carbonate}} water, one litre at a time, in the supplied bottle; the concentrates are added after <b>carbonated</b> <b>water</b> {{is removed from}} the machine. This poses a limitation if one wishes to carbonate wine or fresh fruit juices.|$|E
25|$|Excluding the {{purchase}} price of the machine, typical cost to the end user (2015, United States dollars) is 25 cents per litre of <b>carbonated</b> <b>water</b> generated plus another 50 cents per litre for the soda syrup. Pricing in other countries may vary.|$|E
25|$|Another early type of {{soft drink}} was lemonade, made {{of water and}} lemon juice {{sweetened}} with honey, but without <b>carbonated</b> <b>water.</b> The Compagnie des Limonadiers of Paris was granted a monopoly {{for the sale of}} lemonade soft drinks in 1676. Vendors carried tanks of lemonade on their backs and dispensed cups of the soft drink to Parisians.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is also a}} Moxie Energy Drink and {{a variety}} of [...] "Olde New England Seltzers." [...] The energy drink is citrus-based; it lacks Moxie's gentian root tang, caramel color, and (as of 2008) its {{distinctive}} branding; similarly, the <b>waters</b> are simply <b>carbonated</b> <b>waters</b> with fruit flavors marketed under the Moxie brand.|$|R
50|$|Local Indian tribes {{had long}} {{known of the}} {{benefits}} of the spring and its naturally <b>carbonated</b> <b>waters.</b> In 1767, they shared it with Sir William Johnson, the British general who had led troops in the region during King George's War and later the French and Indian War. At the time the nearest European settlement was at Ballston Lake.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{sunlight}} exposure on chemical migration into PET-bottled waters was investigated. Bottled waters {{were exposed to}} natural sunlight for 2, 6 and 10 days. Migration was dependent {{on the type of}} water. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and Sb migration increased with sunlight exposure in ultrapure <b>water.</b> In <b>carbonated</b> <b>waters,</b> carbon dioxide promoted migration and only formaldehyde increased slightly due to sunlight. Since no aldehydes were detected in non-carbonated waters, we conclude that sunlight exposure has no effect. Concerning Sb, its migration levels were higher in <b>carbonated</b> <b>waters.</b> No unpredictable NIAS were identified in PET-bottled water extracts. Cyto-genotoxicity (Ames and micronucleus assays) and potential endocrine disruption effects (transcriptional-reporter gene assays) were checked in bottled water extracts using bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium) and human cell lines (HepG 2 and MDA-MB 453 -kb 2). PET-bottled water extracts did not induce any toxic effects (cyto-genotoxicity, estrogenic or anti-androgenic activity) in vitro at relevant consumer-exposure levels...|$|R
25|$|Commercial kvass, {{especially}} {{less expensive}} varieties, is occasionally made {{like many other}} soft drinks, using sugar, <b>carbonated</b> <b>water,</b> malt extract, and flavourings. Better brands, often made by beer rather than soft drink manufacturers, usually use {{a variation of the}} traditional process to brew their products. Kvass is commonly served unfiltered, with the yeast still in it, which adds to its unique flavour as well as its high vitamin B content.|$|E
25|$|A {{soft drink}} (see {{terminology}} for other names) is a drink that typically contains <b>carbonated</b> <b>water</b> (although orange soda and lemonade, among others, {{are usually not}} carbonated), a sweetener, and a natural or artificial flavoring. The sweetener may be sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, sugar substitutes (in the case of diet drinks), {{or some combination of}} these. Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives, and other ingredients.|$|E
25|$|No longer manufactured, the Coca-Cola BreakMate was a three-flavour {{dispenser}} {{introduced by}} Coca-Cola and Siemens in 1988. Intended {{for use in}} offices with five to fifty people, its refrigerated compartment held three individual one-litre plastic containers of soda syrup and a CO2 tank. Like a soda fountain, it mixed syrup in a 1:5 ratio with <b>carbonated</b> <b>water.</b> In North America, Coca-Cola discontinued spare BreakMate parts in 2007 and stopped distributing the syrup in 2010.|$|E

25|$|The first {{sales were}} at Jacob's Pharmacy in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 8, 1886. It was {{initially}} {{sold as a}} patent medicine for five cents a glass at soda fountains, which were popular in the United States at the time due {{to the belief that}} <b>carbonated</b> <b>water</b> was good for the health. Pemberton claimed Coca-Cola cured many diseases, including morphine addiction, indigestion, nerve disorders, headaches, and impotence. Pemberton ran the first advertisement for the beverage on May 29 of the same year in the Atlanta Journal.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not long}} before {{flavoring}} was combined with <b>carbonated</b> <b>water.</b> The earliest reference to carbonated ginger beer is in a Practical Treatise on Brewing. published in 1809. The drinking of either natural or artificial mineral water was considered at the time to be a healthy practice, and was promoted by advocates of temperance. Pharmacists selling mineral waters began to add herbs and chemicals to unflavored mineral water. They used birch bark (see birch beer), dandelion, sarsaparilla, fruit extracts, and other substances. Flavorings were also added to improve the taste.|$|E

An example of ice cream soda is the root beer float. In 1874, the ice cream soda was invented by Robert M. Green of Philadelphia. Green's invention {{paved the way for the}} soda fountain industry to flourish and for many new spoon novelties such as ice cream sundaes to be created.|$|E
