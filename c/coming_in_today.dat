5000|$|At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Drouin jumped {{a season}} best height of 2.38 metres {{to win the}} gold medal, {{defeating}} Barshim and Bondarenko. Drouin cleared every height on his first attempt, until he missed at 2.40 while going for the Olympic record. It was the second medal won by a Canadian male athlete, the first gold medal for a Canadian male, and Canada's third gold medal overall during the Rio de Janeiro Olympiad. Drouin was the first Canadian to win {{a gold medal in}} a field sport since Duncan McNaughton, who also won the high jump at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Of the historic gold, Drouin said [...] "We've had a pretty good tradition in high jump, so myself and my teammates are just trying to keep re-writing it. It doesn't matter that I was world champion <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>today.</b> In my eyes, everyone was on even playing ground right from the start. The pressure that maybe other people felt for me I certainly wasn't internalizing." ...|$|E

40|$|Stress and {{conflict}} are realities of life. Most workers feel stressed {{on a daily}} basis. Perhaps this stress {{is due to the}} recession in the economy, job losses, more work, going to school while working, job change, more responsibilities, uncertainty, conflict, and/or too many things to achieve in a short time period. People are living in a constant period of transition, and the shelf life of solutions keeps getting shorter since what works today can become obsolete a few months later. Where is all the stress <b>coming</b> from <b>in</b> <b>today</b> 2 ̆ 7 s life? Stress is often coming from or caused by people, technology, new information, and globalization trends. Some of the commonly addressed sources of stress for businesses can include changes in nature of the workforce, economy, social trends, politics, leadership, management, organizational structures, products, services, customers, changing {{and conflict}}ing demands, and location of where the firm produces or offers its products. Managing Workplace Stress and Conflict amid Change is about helping people effectively manage stress, conflict, and change in the workplace. The topics covered in this book include change management, conflict management, time management, stress management, and effective problem-solving. The book emphasizes that stress, conflict and change are realities of life in every organization. They are a natural part of evolution and human development. They have been handled for thousands of years and should be positively managed so that professionals may maximize their productivity and success in life. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|Indeed, Kostić was {{the last}} great poet among the Romanticists. He was a {{controversial}} personality, and the critics {{had a field day}} with him. He was more celebrated than understood in his youth, and he experienced a general loss of popularity in his old age, however, real fame came to him only after his death, although even that was slow <b>in</b> <b>coming.</b> <b>Today,</b> it is generally accepted that Kostić is the originator of modern Serbian poetry, the predecessor of the avant garde and other creative experiments which prevailed in Serbian poetry later on. In his life, and in his poetry as well, he constantly deviated from the ordinary and the customary, becoming known {{as an example of a}} bizarre, eccentric Romanticist who was rarely taken seriously by anyone. Yet, this poetic fantast was the most educated Serbian poet of the time; he knew classical and modern languages, translated Shakespeare, was a writer of aesthetic and philosophical treatises, and was the most significant thinker of Serbian Romanticism.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this chapter, we {{presented}} {{a review of}} the state-of-the-art, recent advances, and remaining challenges in the field of antenna/human body interactions in the 60 GHz band, with a particular emphasis on the near-field interactions that may occur in emerging body-centric MMW applications. For new near-field exposure scenarios expected to appear <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> years, <b>today</b> there is no any clear regulation in terms of the exposure assessment, and standard methodologies for compliance testing are not available in the 60 GHz band. Most of the exposure guidelines and standards recommend IPD as a dosimetric quantity. It cannot be directly used as a metric for near-field exposures since practically it is very challenging, if not impossible, to determine numerically or experimentally local IPD under near-field conditions. Some reports suggest that temperature rise could be used as an exposure metric at MMW. However, in practice, it is not always possible because of some limitations discussed in this chapter. We suggest to use eIPD as a metric; it can be conveniently retrieved from SAR computations and/or measurements and takes into account the perturbation of the wireless device radiation due to the body proximity. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016...|$|R
