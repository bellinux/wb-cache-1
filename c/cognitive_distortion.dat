Fairburn et al.'s model discusses the process in which an individual falls into the binge-purge cycle and thus develops bulimia. Fairburn et al. argue that extreme concern with weight and shape coupled with low self-esteem will result in strict, rigid, and inflexible dietary rules. Accordingly, this would lead to unrealistically restricted eating, which may consequently induce an eventual [...] "slip" [...] where the individual commits a minor infraction of the strict and inflexible dietary rules. Moreover, the <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortion</b> due to dichotomous thinking leads the individual to binge. The binge subsequently should trigger a perceived loss of control, promoting the individual to purge in hope of counteracting the binge. However, Fairburn et al. assert the cycle repeats itself, and thus consider the binge-purge cycle to be self-perpetuating.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a moderating {{variable}} is level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortion.</b> An individual {{with high levels of}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortion</b> might react adversely to potentially innocuous events, and may have increased difficulty reacting to them in an adaptive manner (Shoal & Giancola, 2005). In their study, Shoal and Giancola investigated the moderating effects of <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortion</b> on adolescent substance use. Individuals with low levels of <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortion</b> may be more apt to choose more adaptive methods of coping with social problems, thereby potentially reducing the risk of drug use. Individuals with high levels of cognitive distortions, because of their increased misperceptions and misattributions, are at increased risk for social difficulties. Individuals {{may be more likely to}} react aggressively or inappropriately, potentially alienating themselves from their peers, thereby putting them at greater risk for delinquent behaviors, including substance use and abuse. In this study, social problems are a significant risk factor for drug use when moderated by high levels of cognitive distortions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> are an {{important}} focus in many investigations and treatments of externalizing problem behavior, such as antisocial, delinquent, and aggressive behavior. Yet the overall strength of the association between <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> and externalizing behavior is unknown. Furthermore, it is unknown whether interventions can effectively reduce <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> and subsequently externalizing behavior. To fill these gaps, we conducted a meta-analysis of 71 studies on 20, 685 participants. Results showed a medium to large effect size (d =. 70) for the association between <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> and externalizing behavior. Interventions had a small effect (d =. 27) on reducing <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions.</b> In a subset of intervention studies that incorporated both <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> and externalizing behavior, however, neither <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> nor externalizing behavior were effectively reduced. Hence, although <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> are substantially linked to externalizing behavior and interventions can reduce <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions,</b> a subsequent reduction in externalizing behavior remains to be demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{gender differences in}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions,</b> moral judgment and empathy in children, aged nine to thirteen years. Subsequently, the relationship was investigated of <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions,</b> moral judgment and empathy with externalizing problem behaviour. It was hypothesized {{that the relationship between}} moral judgment and antisocial behavior is mediated by <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions.</b> The study involved a total of 92 participants from two regular elementary schools. First, the results show that there are no gender differences in <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions,</b> moral judgment and empathy. As expected, a positive correlation between <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> and externalizing problem behaviour, and a negative correlation between moral judgment and externalizing problem behaviour was found. However, no relationship was found between empathy and externalizing problem behaviour. Mediation analysis showed that the relationship between moral judgment and externalizing problem behaviour was explained by <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions.</b> The conclusion from this study is that <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> are an important predictor of externalizing problem behaviour. Perhaps these results can lead to developing a program for children with externalizing problems that reduces the prevalence of <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> {{are held}} to {{contribute}} to sexual offending against children {{in a number of}} theoretical explanations of such crimes. However, not only is there little or no direct evidence in support of the centrality of <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> in offending but recent research has questioned whether the concept has explanatory power. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> are variously seen as necessary for the offender to offend against children, as post-offending justifications for the offence, or as reflecting distorted patterns in the offender’s upbringing. This paper explores the role of <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> in sex offending by comparing the distortions of contact sex offenders against children with Internet child pornography offenders without contact offences against children. A new <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> questionnaire was developed which was suitable for administration to Internet offenders who had no contact offences against children as well as being suitable for contact offenders. It was found that some <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> are frequently agreed with by sex offenders against children whereas others were seldom or never agreed with.

40|$|<b>Cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> are {{negative}} biases {{in thinking that}} are theorized to represent vulnerability factors for depression and dysphoria. Despite the emphasis placed on <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> {{in the context of}} cognitive behavioural theory and practice, a paucity of research has examined the mechanisms through which they impact depressive symptomatology. Both adaptive and maladaptive styles of humor represent coping strategies that may mediate the relation between <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> and depressive symptoms. The current study examined the correlations between the frequency and impact of <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> across both social and achievement-related contexts and types of humor. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> were associated with reduced use of adaptive Affiliative and Self-Enhancing humor styles and increased use of maladaptive Aggressive and Self-Defeating humor. Reduced use of Self-Enhancing humor mediated the relationship between most types of <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> and depressed mood, indicating that distorted negative thinking may interfere with an individual’s ability to adopt a humorous and cheerful outlook on life (i. e., use Self-Enhancing humor) as a way of regulating emotions and coping with stress, thereby resulting in elevated depressive symptoms. Similarly, Self-Defeating humor mediated the association of the social impact of <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> with depression, such that this humor style may be used as a coping strategy for dealing with distorted thinking that ultimately backfires and results in increased dysphoria...|$|R

The causal mediational interpretation identifies dysfunctional attitudes as most distal to depressive symptoms, followed by <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions,</b> <b>cognitive</b> triad, and negative automatic thoughts, with each construct successively more proximal to depressive symptoms. By contrast, the symptom model reverses the causal chain with negative automatic thoughts as the most proximal consequence and dysfunctional attitudes as the most distal consequence of depression. The bidirectional model merges both interpretations into one model. Previous studies on sequential interpretations of Beck’s model have not included <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions</b> and the <b>cognitive</b> triad and did not test the bidirectional model finding contradictory empirical evidence for the sequential order. Method: In the 3 -wave longitudinal study, 308 German university students without clinically significant depressive symptoms (245 female, average age: 23. 69 years) completed self-report questionnaires measuring their dysfunctional attitudes, <b>cognitive</b> <b>distortions,</b> <b>cognitive</b> triad, negative automatic thoughts, and depressive symptoms.
