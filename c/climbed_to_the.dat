5|$|A {{folklore}} {{story is}} {{also associated with}} Sakurai Genbei, who was Ikeda Terumasa's master carpenter {{in the construction of}} the keep. According to the legend, Sakurai was dissatisfied with his construction, feeling that the keep leaned a little to the southeast. Eventually, he became distraught and <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the keep, where he jumped to his death with a chisel in his mouth.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} match ended, Rick Rude and the Junkyard Dog {{made their way}} to the ring. Their match began as Rude {{attacked}} Junkyard Dog from behind, who retaliated by headbutting Rude several times. Subsequently, Rude <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wrestling ring's top rope and pulled down his tights to reveal another pair of tights with a picture of Cheryl Roberts on them. As a result, Jake Roberts, Cheryl Roberts' husband, ran to the ring and attacked Rude, forcing the referee to disqualify the Junkyard Dog.|$|E
5|$|As the Browns <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{top of the}} NFL, {{speculation}} {{began to}} mount that Brown might return to the Buckeyes. Wes Felser had resigned as the team's coach, and Brown {{was seen as a}} possible replacement. But Brown had also alienated many Ohio State alumni by failing to return to the school after World War II and for signing away players including Groza before their college eligibility expired. He interviewed with the university's athletic board on January 27, 1951, but the board unanimously rejected Brown in favor of Woody Hayes, who was unanimously endorsed by the board of trustees.|$|E

5|$|Following on {{from the}} success of their debut album, they {{released}} Talk on Corners and In Blue in 1997 and 2000 respectively. Originally Talk on Corners met with lukewarm success, until a remix version was released, when it topped the charts in many countries, and reached platinum status in the United Kingdom and Australia. In Blue moved towards mainstream pop, placing heavy emphasis on electronic synthesisers. It was successful, and was No. 1 in its first sales week in the UK, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria and debuted at No. 2 in France and Norway. It <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top position during its second week in Sweden and Spain.|$|E
5|$|The local Cathars held {{a special}} place in their {{religion}} for horses, especially through their belief in the transmigration of souls. There was also a belief in Pamiers that knights took their horses with them when they died. In the 12th century, the Cathar princess Esclarmonde of Foix <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fortress of Château de Montségur {{on the back of a}} small, sure-footed black horse. In the 14th century, the same small black horses are mentioned as accompanying the armies of Gaston III, Count of Foix.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} between Monty Brown and Jeff Hardy to {{determine}} the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy scored a two-count on Brown by slamming the back of Brown's head and neck into the mat with a reverse neckbreaker. Hardy then <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top rope and jumped off with a somersault toward Brown, who was laying {{on his back in}} the ring, to attempt his signature Swanton Bomb maneuver. Once Hardy jumped, Brown moved {{out of the way and}} then performed his signature Pounce maneuver by crashing into Hardy. Brown followed by pinning Hardy at 8 minutes and 43 seconds to win the contest and become number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

5|$|A log {{portion of}} the {{original}} Oklahoma Row was moved north and now sits {{on the east side}} of Highway 94 in Monte Ne. It is used for storage. The three-story concrete-and-stone tower still stands and remains above water on the edge of Beaver Lake. This section is often incorrectly referred to as the bank building and the honeymoon suite. Monte Ne was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 because of the historic significance of being so closely associated with Harvey and its unique architecture and engineering. Despite this, what is left of Monte Ne has fallen victim to severe neglect and vandalism. It is covered with spray paint and graffiti, as well as being cracked and full of debris. In 2011 the fire department was called to help a person who had <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top floor and gotten stuck in the chimney. Because of this incident and the general state of the remains, the Army Corps of Engineers erected a temporary barbed wire fence around the tower.|$|E
5|$|In 1859 Francis D'Arcy-Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, died, leaving Conisbrough to his nephew, Sackville Lane-Fox, the Baron Conyers. The keep {{remained}} in good condition, but by 1884 {{it was apparent}} that repairs were needed and the antiquarian George Clark recommended urgent work to repair the stonework. If finances allowed it, he also urged the reinstallation of a roof and wooden floors. Limited repairs were subsequently approved by the trustees of Lord Conyers, although Clark's colleague, A. Ellis, expressed concerns that railings to protect the visitors who routinely <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the keep had not been funded. A reported £500 was spent by the trustees renovating the castle ruins, including the construction of a lodge in the outer bailey for the castle keeper, completed in 1885, and improvements to the footpaths.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1845, Palmer {{traveled}} to Oregon without his family, as captain of a wagon train of 23 wagons. Stephen Meek served as the train's paid guide. Meek left the group at Fort Hall to lead {{some of the members}} on the Meek Cutoff. The remaining parts of the wagon train {{reached the end of the}} overland Oregon Trail at the Columbia River, and unwilling to wait for transport down the dangerous Cascade Rapids, Palmer's party joined Sam Barlow's party in a quest for passage through the Cascade Range around the south side of Mount Hood. Palmer <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 9,000-foot level of Mount Hood on October 7, 1845—with little food and the scant protection of moccasins—to scout a route off the mountains. This was Mount Hood's first recorded climb; the Palmer Glacier on the mountain is named for him.|$|E

5|$|Pickford {{was born}} Gladys Louise Smith in Toronto and began acting {{on stage in}} 1900. She started her film career in the United States in 1909. Initially with the Biograph film company, {{she moved to the}} Independent Motion Picture Company (IMP) in 1911, then briefly to the Majestic Film Company later that same year, {{followed}} by a return to Biograph in 1912. After appearing in over 150 short films during her years with these studios she began working in features with Zukor's Famous Players Film Company, a studio which eventually became part of Paramount Pictures. By 1916 Pickford's popularity had <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point that she was awarded a contract that made her a partner with Zukor and allowed her to produce her own films. In 1919 Pickford teamed with D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks to create United Artists, an organization designed to distribute their own films. Following the release of Secrets (1933) Pickford retired from acting in motion pictures. However, she remained active as a producer for several years afterwards. She sold her stock in United Artists in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Staff at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., {{reported}} {{that some of}} the animals in the park appeared to show behavior suggesting that they anticipated the earthquake from seconds to minutes before it was felt in the area. The earthquake was felt at the great ape exhibits during afternoon feeding time. About three to ten seconds before the quake, many of the apes abandoned their food and <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of a tree-like structure in the exhibit. The red ruffed lemurs sounded an alarm call about 15 minutes before the quake, and the flock of 64 flamingos rushed about and grouped themselves together just before the quake. During the quake, some animals vocalized, some ran or dove for cover, and some stood up and stared at the walls of their enclosures. Some of the animals remained agitated {{for the rest of the}} day, while others calmed quickly. The Zoo's giant pandas did not appear to respond to the quake.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning after}} the arrests the {{soldiers}} continued marching north, proceeding 10 miles (16 kilometers) further to the headwaters of Fishing Creek and {{the base of the}} mountains in northern Columbia County. From here they marched up the valley of East Branch Fishing Creek to its headwaters. The soldiers extensively searched the mountains of northern Columbia County for half a day, going as far north as the headwaters of East Branch Fishing Creek in southern Sullivan County, where they <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of North Mountain in three groups. At the headwaters of East Branch Fishing Creek the soldiers turned south again, then headed up West Branch Fishing Creek as far as the Sullivan County line. They found some evidence that people had been in the area, but these appeared to have been hunting or logging camps.|$|E

5|$|The seventh {{match was}} the main event from SmackDown, a Punjabi Prison match for the World Heavyweight Championship, where, Batista, defended the title against The Great Khali. In the match, two giant wooden cages {{surrounded}} the ring, and, to win, a competitor had to escape both structures. After both men prevented the other from escaping, Khali utilized a leather strap as a weapon. Batista later used the leather strap and attempted to climb over inner cage, but Khali stopped him and squeezed Batista's head with a Vise Grip. Khali then called for a door to be opened but Batista struck him with a low blow. The match ended when Khali had climbed over the inner cage and began climbing the outer cage. Batista then mounted the inner cage, jumped to the second cage and, overtaking Khali, <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, thereby winning the match and retaining the title.|$|E
5|$|The final bout of {{the event}} was the main event match between Bam Bam Bigelow and Lawrence Taylor. Bigelow was {{accompanied}} {{by the members of}} DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation: King Kong Bundy, Tatanka, Irwin R. Schyster, Kama, and Nikolai Volkoff. To prevent the Corporation members from interfering, Taylor brought several football players: Ken Norton Jr., Chris Spielman, Rickey Jackson, Carl Banks, Reggie White, and Steve McMichael. Taylor gained the advantage early and performed a clothesline that knocked Bigelow out of the ring. Once he returned to the ring, Bigelow took control of the match by kicking Taylor repeatedly and performing a Boston crab submission hold to hurt Taylor's back. Taylor got out of the hold and threw Bigelow with a suplex. Bigelow recovered and performed several headbutts on Taylor before executing a moonsault flip to knock Taylor down to the mat. Taylor began {{to take control of the}} match again, but Bigelow kicked him in the back of the head and then performed a headbutt from the top rope. Bigelow was unable to pin Taylor, however. Taylor <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second rope, jumped off, and used his forearm to hit Bigelow. He then covered Bigelow to win the match.|$|E
5|$|The last {{match of}} the night was the main event between The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage), {{accompanied}} by Miss Elizabeth, and The Mega Bucks (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant), accompanied by André's manager Bobby Heenan and DiBiase's bodyguard Virgil. Jesse Ventura was the special guest referee. The Mega Powers took the early advantage over DiBiase. After Hogan attacked André the Giant, {{who was on the}} ring apron, The Mega Bucks were able to regain control. After a while, all four men began brawling, and André knocked The Mega Powers out of the ring. Subsequently, as part of the scripted ending to the match, Miss Elizabeth began arguing with Ventura, the referee, and ripped off her skirt to reveal her underwear. While the Mega Bucks were distracted, Savage <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top rope and dropped the Macho Elbow on DiBiase, followed by Hogan hitting the leg drop on DiBiase. As Hogan pinned DiBiase, Ventura, a villainous character aligned with The Mega Bucks (despite being a long time on-air Savage fan and his former tag-team partner), began an obviously slow three-count. As a result, Savage slammed Ventura's arm down for the third time, indicating that Hogan and Savage had won the match.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} match (which {{received}} a pre-match endorsement from Shawn Michaels) saw Adrian Neville challenging Bo Dallas in the first-ever ladder {{match for the}} NXT Championship. In {{the first half of}} the match, Dallas attempted to climb a ladder while he pinned Neville under the ladder, but Neville used his legs to push the ladder over. Near the end of the match, Neville attempted his signature Red Arrow, but Dallas pushed him off the ropes to the apron and the floor. Neville recovered and used the ropes to springboard over a climbing Dallas and leapfrog him on the ladder. In response, Dallas powerbombed Neville onto a ladder in the corner of the ring. Dallas then charged while holding a ladder, but Neville kicked the ladder into Dallas' face and slammed Dallas onto the ladder. Neville <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top rope and dove off with his Red Arrow while Dallas was on the ladder. This incapacitated Dallas long enough for Neville to set up and climb the ladder to retrieve the NXT Championship hanging above the ring. The show ended with Neville celebrating with his new championship.|$|E
