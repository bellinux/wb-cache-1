50|$|Turbo Esprit is a {{video game}} {{published}} by Durell Software in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Amstrad CPC. The game was very detailed and advanced for its time, featuring <b>car</b> <b>indicator</b> lights, pedestrians, traffic lights, and {{a view of the}} car's interior controls. It may also feature the earliest example of a free-roaming city environment in a computer game. Turbo Esprit was the first free-roaming driving game, and has been cited as a major influence on the later Grand Theft Auto series.|$|E

Also in 1986, Sega produced Out Run, {{one of the}} most graphically impressive games of its time. It used two Motorola 68000 CPUs for its 2D sprite-based driving engine, and it became an instant classic that spawned many sequels. It was notable for giving the player the non-linear choice of which route to take through the game and the choice of soundtrack to listen to while driving, represented as radio stations. The game also featured up to five multiple endings depending on the route taken, and each one was an ending sequence rather than a simple [...] "Congratulations" [...] as was common in game endings at the time. That same year, Konami's WEC Le Mans was a race driving simulator that attempted to accurately simulate the 24 Hours of Le Mans competition, with fairly realistic handling, a day-night cycle, and the use of force feedback to simulate road vibration {{in the form of a}} vibrating steering wheel that reacts to the driver's acceleration and off-road bumps.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, car {{has become}} one of the most popular modes of {{transportation}} because many of Malaysians could afford to have a car. There are many choices of cars in the market, from budget cars to the luxurious cars, only a matter now is affordability. One of the important aspects of a car is security because car theft is a crime that occurs all around the world, including Malaysia. Currently, local car manufacturers in Malaysia provides a standard security system for each car manufactured, that is central locking system and standard car alarm. The focus is on the car locking system, where the conventional remote for the car locking system is commonly consists of two buttons, which is the first, is for lock and unlock function and the second button is for the car alarm. There is no indicator that indicates the lock status of the car, acting as the double confirmation for the lock status. Here comes the idea to improve the conventional car lock system by adding an indicator to work as the second confirmation for the car lock status. The project is named as <b>Car</b> Lock <b>Indicator</b> and using microcontroller Motorola MC 68 HC 11 A 1 as the heart of the system.

40|$|Background. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning, with {{cortisol}} as {{its major}} output hormone, has been presumed {{to play a}} key role in the development of psychopathology. Predicting affective disorders from diurnal cortisol levels has been inconclusive, whereas the predictive value of stress-induced cortisol concentrations has not been studied before. The aim of this study was to predict mental disorders over a 3 -year follow-up from awakening and stress-induced cortisol concentrations. Method. Data were used from 561 TRAILS (TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey) participants, a prospective cohort study of Dutch adolescents. Saliva samples were collected at awakening and half an hour later and during a social stress test at age 16. Mental disorders were assessed 3 years later with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Results. A lower cortisol awakening response (CAR) marginally significantly predicted new disorders [odds ratio (OR) 0. 77, p = 0. 06]. A flat recovery slope predicted disorders with a first onset after the experimental session (OR 1. 27, p = 0. 04). Recovery revealed smaller, non-significant ORs when predicting new onset affective or anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, or dependence disorders in three separate models, corrected for all other new onsets. Conclusions. Our results suggest that delayed recovery and possibly reduced <b>CAR</b> are <b>indicators</b> of a more general risk status and may be part of a common pathway to psychopathology. Delayed recovery suggests that individuals at risk for mental disorders perceived the social stress test as less controllable and less predictable...|$|R

Choice based sampling and binary logit analysis are used to investigate the connection between the choice made and the characteristics of the elderly. The results indicate that being married and owning a car increase the odds of elderly persons staying in their own homes as opposed to moving to an SCA, while renting a home decreases them. Analysis indicates that marital status is strongly related to age, while owning a <b>car</b> is an <b>indicator</b> of independence and perhaps higher income.

40|$|This study {{examines}} associations between {{quality of life}} and multiple indicators of socio-economic position among people aged 50 or more years in 10 European countries, and analyses whether the relative importance of the socio-economic measures vary by age. The data are from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) in 2004. 15, 080 cases were analysed. Quality of life was measured by a short version of the CASP- 19 questionnaire, which represents quality of life as comprising four conceptual domains of individual needs that are particularly relevant in later life: control (C), autonomy (A), self-realisation (S) and pleasure (P). The short version has 12 items (three for each domain). Five indicators of socio-economic position were used: income, education, home ownership, net worth, and car ownership. A multiple logistic regression showed that quality of life was associated with socio-economic position, but that the associations varied by country. Relatively small socio-economic differences in quality of life were observed for Switzerland, but comparatively large differences in Germany. Education, income, net worth, and car ownership consistently related to quality of life, but the association of home ownership was less consistent. There was no indication that the socio-economic differences in quality of life diminished after retirement (i. e. from 65 + years). Conventional measures of socio-economic position (education and income), as well as alternative <b>indicators</b> (<b>car</b> ownership and household net worth), usefully identified the differential risks of poor quality of life among older people before and after the conventional retirement age. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of bus systems {{is a vital}} issue on the transport agenda, since urban areas are yearning for high quality alternatives for the private <b>car.</b> A key <b>indicator</b> of reliability is {{a low level of}} day-to-day travel time variability (TTV). To obtain funds for reducing TTV, it is necessary to give evidence for the benefits from such improvement, but current tools for estimating the cost of TTV are insufficient. This thesis covers issues that arise when analysts need to show that improved bus infrastructure brings benefits from reduced TTV. The first part of the thesis aims at understanding how the attitudes of travellers to TTV can be converted into monetary terms. The design of a survey is described, where respondents trade-off between TTV and other attributes. A modelling experiment, based on the survey responses, finds that the effect of TTV is best explained using variables that represent trip scheduling considerations. Following is a series of experiments that seek to estimate the willingness-to-pay for reduced TTV {{in a way that is}} sensitive to taste variation between travellers. Several Mixed Logit models are estimated, but some doubts about their credibility are raised, and hence the same willingness-to-pay estimates are also computed using nonparametric techniques. Some conclusions are drawn regarding the process of estimating heterogeneous willingness-to-pay and the ability to recognise the willingness-to-pay from survey data. The starting point for the second part of the thesis is the lack of tools for estimating the level of TTV in hypothetical scenarios. We, consider the case for using traffic microsimulation to estimate TTV by running a microsimulation model multiple times, and looking at the variation between runs as an estimate of the variation between different days. Such concept of estimation requires a special calibration methodology, which sets the level of simulated inter-run variability at a similar level to inter-day variability in the real network. A full calibration methodology is developed, tackling methodological, computational and statistical issues. Finally, the demand and supply methodologies are combined, and it is illustrated how the savings from improved bus infrastructure can be examined. The contribution of the entire study includes methodological and technical insights into modelling the attitudes to TTV, estimating the distribution of the willingness-to-pay and calibrating traffic microsimulation models; but it also brings up policy issues concerning the role of TTV in transport appraisal. ...|$|R
