50|$|Eschenbach {{was born}} in Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland). His parents were Margarethe (née Jaross) and Heribert Ringmann. He was {{orphaned}} during World War II. His mother died giving birth to him; his father, a politically active anti-Nazi, {{was sent to the}} Eastern front as part of a Nazi punishment battalion where he was killed. As a result of this trauma, Eschenbach did not speak for a year, until he was asked if he wanted to play music. Wallydore Eschenbach (née Jaross), his mother's cousin, adopted him in 1946 and began to teach him to play the piano. At age 11, he attended a <b>concert</b> conducted <b>by</b> Wilhelm <b>Furtwängler</b> which had a great impact on him. In 1955 Eschenbach enrolled at the Musikhochschule in Cologne, studying piano with Hans-Otto Schmidt-Neuhaus and conducting with Wilhelm Brückner-Rüggeberg. He then pursued further studies at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg with Eliza Hansen (piano) and Wilhelm Brückner-Rüggeberg (conducting).|$|R

25|$|There are a {{huge number}} of Furtwängler {{recordings}} currently available, mostly live. Many of these were made during World War II using experimental tape technology. After the war they were confiscated by the Soviet Union for decades, and have only recently become widely available, often on multiple legitimate and illegitimate labels. In spite of their limitations, the recordings from this era are widely admired <b>by</b> <b>Furtwängler</b> devotees.|$|R
60|$|Schwartz conjectures {{that the}} serpent is the {{lightning}} and Athene the cloud. A {{long list of}} equally cogent reasons for identifying Athene with the lightning and the thunder-cloud has been compiled <b>by</b> <b>Furtwangler,</b> and deserves some attention. The passage excellently illustrates the error of taking poetic details in authors as late as Pindar for survivals of the absolute original form of an elemental myth.|$|R

50|$|Taking Sides is a 1995 play by British playwright Ronald Harwood, {{about the}} post-war United States denazification {{investigation}} of the German conductor and composer Wilhelm Furtwängler on charges of having served the Nazi regime.

50|$|In 1908, Schenker {{had hoped}} for an {{appointment}} at the Akademie für Musik und darstellende Kunst (today the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna) However, the conflict between his beliefs {{and the need to}} compromise to work within an academic system ultimately thwarted the opportunity. Even as late as 1932-33, Furtwängler tried to intercede with Ludwig Karpath to obtain a position for Schenker, without success. Despite the lack of success, Schenker was gratified <b>by</b> <b>Furtwängler's</b> words.|$|R

50|$|According to Frederic Spotts' Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics, Adolf Hitler {{compared}} this symphony {{favorably with}} Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. When he consecrated {{a bust of}} Bruckner at Regensburg's Walhalla temple in 1937, the Adagio from the Seventh was played as Hitler stood in quiet admiration. A recording of the Adagio was played before the official radio announcement of the German defeat at Stalingrad on 31 January 1943 and before Reich President Karl Dönitz announced Hitler's death on Radio Berlin on 1 May 1945; a recording <b>by</b> <b>Furtwängler</b> was used.|$|R
50|$|In Georgian mythology, Amirani is {{a culture}} hero who {{challenged}} the chief god, and like Prometheus was chained on the Caucasian mountains where birds would eat his organs. This {{aspect of the}} myth had a significant influence on the Greek imagination. It is recognizable from a Greek gem roughly dated {{to the time of}} the Hesiod poems, which show Prometheus with hands bound behind his body and crouching before a bird with long wings. This same image would also be used later in the Rome of the Augustan age as documented <b>by</b> <b>Furtwangler.</b>|$|R

50|$|One legend is {{that the}} compact disc was {{deliberately}} designed to have a 74-minute playing {{so that it could}} accommodate Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Kees Immink, Philips' chief engineer, who developed the CD, recalls that a commercial tug-of-war between the development partners, Sony and Philips, led to a settlement in a neutral 12-cm diameter format. The 1951 performance of the Ninth Symphony conducted <b>by</b> <b>Furtwängler</b> was brought forward as the perfect excuse for the change, and was put forth in a Philips news release celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Compact Disc as the reason for the 74-minute length.|$|R
5000|$|A {{special case}} of the {{existence}} theorem is when m = 1 and H = P1. In this case the generalized ideal class group is the ideal class group of K, and the existence theorem says there exists a unique abelian extension L/K with Galois group isomorphic to the ideal class group of K such that L is unramified at all places of K. This extension is called the Hilbert class field. It was conjectured by David Hilbert to exist, and existence in this special case was proved <b>by</b> <b>Furtwängler</b> in 1907, before Takagi's general existence theorem.|$|R
