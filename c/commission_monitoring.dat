40|$|Background: Current {{data suggest}} that alcohol might play {{significant}} role in error commission. Error commission {{is related to the}} functions of the Error Monitoring and Processing System (EMPS) located in the substantia nigra of the midbrain, basal ganglia and cortex of the forebrain. The main components of the EMPS are the dopaminergic system and anterior cingulate cortex. Although, recent data show that alcohol disrupts the EMPS, the ways in which alcohol affects this system are poorly understood. Aims & Objectives: We reviewed recent data that suggest the indirect effect of alcohol use on error commission. Methods / Study Design: Databases were searched for relevant literatures using the following keywords combination – Alcohol AND Error Commission (OR Processing, Monitoring, Correction, Detection). Literatures were searched in scientific databases (Medline, DOAJ, Embase from 1940 to August 2010), journal website (Psychophysiology, Neuroscience and Trends in Neuroscience). Manual book search, including library information were included in the data collection process. Other additional information was searched through Google. Results / Findings: Blood and brain glucose levels {{play a vital role in}} error commission, and are related to error <b>commission,</b> <b>monitoring</b> and processing through the modulation of the activity of the dopaminergic system. To summarize the results of our findings, here we suggest a hypothesis of Alcohol-Related Glucose-Dependent System of Error Monitoring and Processing (ARGD-EMPS hypothesis), which holds that the disruption of the EMPS is related to the competency of glucose homeostasis regulation, which in turn may determine the dopamine level as a major component of the EMPS. The ARGD-EMPS hypothesis explains the general processes and mechanism of alcohol related disruption of the EMPS. Conclusion: Alcohol may indirectly disrupt the EMPS by affecting dopamine level through disorders in blood glucose homeostasis regulation. The effect of alcohol use on EMPS may be realized through its action on the blood/brain glucose level...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{examined}} Bonn Agreement annual {{statistics from}} aerial surveillance activities between 1986 and 2010 and examines {{the levels of}} flight hours for observed and confirmed oil spills in the North Sea. It also looks at the results of EMSA CleanSeaNet satellite imagery for the region between 2007 and 2011 for observed and confirmed spills. In terms of observed spills, {{there has been a}} significant decline in the numbers of spills and volume of oil entering the marine environment over more than two decades. This is also the case for discharges from oil and gas installations, where OSPAR <b>Commission</b> <b>monitoring</b> data identifies a very large fall in operational discharges from installations over the last decade in particular. The decadal OSPAR Quality Status Reports have also identified improvements in the region while identifying areas for further action in reducing oil inputs still further, especially from ageing oil and gas infrastructure. Projects such as Bonn Agreement BE-AWARE have mapped and identified the risk of oil pollution across the region, while Bonn-OSINet and COSIweb have resulted in improved methods to not only identify the make-up of an oil spill but also to increase the likelihood of matching samples from a spill to samples from potential sources. Beached bird surveys also provide a tool in monitoring not only the impacts of large spills from accidents but also levels of chronic oil pollution in coastal and offshore areas. The results of investigations into oil pollution in the waters of Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany are discussed, while an examination of the legal structure for monitoring and dealing with oil pollution in UK waters is presented. Legislative measures such as the MARPOL Convention, EU Directive on Port Reception Facilities and national legislation have contributed to a reduction in oil being discharged through operational activities from ships, while accidental spills have also been reduced as a result of better vessel standards and improved traffic management in the southern and eastern North Sea. While illegal discharges continue to present a problem and there remains a need to reduce pollution in offshore areas, it is clear {{that there has been a}} significant improvement in the state of the North Sea in terms of oil over several decades...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} combines four {{empirical studies}} on member states’ legal {{compliance with the}} European Union (EU) directives and their provisions. The studies address two main objectives. First, they aim to explain timely and correct compliance {{as a function of}} member states’ attributes to specific EU policy requirements. The second objective is to account for the ‘missing link’ between EU decision-making and national implementation. In addition, this dissertation also seeks to improve our understanding of member states’ level of compliance with the EU requirements. Thus, the following questions are also addressed: How can we measure member states’ compliance with regard to EU directives and directives’ provisions? and Are there differences in member states’ performance with regard to different types of compliance problems, such as transposition delay, infringement procedures and, the correct transposition of directives’ provisions? The theoretical answers to the explanatory research questions are based on the core assumption that both the willingness and the capacity of member states to comply with different EU requirements are a function of member states’ cost-benefit considerations regarding the implementation of particular EU directives and directives’ provisions in domestic systems. This study combines two main theoretical approaches to explain member states’ compliance with particular directives and directives’ provisions: enforcement and management. Whereas enforcement stresses the importance of the benefits and the costs of non-compliance (e. g. alternative priorities, incentives to deviate, fear of sanctions), the management approach focuses on the costs of compliance (e. g. capacity limitations, costs of domestic adjustment to required changes, and rule ambiguity) as main explanations for member states’ failure to meet the EU requirements (Chayes and Chayes, 1993; Downs et al., 1999; Fearon, 1998; Tallberg, 2003). Hypotheses are derived on the influence of member states’ incentives to deviate from particular EU decision outcomes, the level of conflict between member states during the EU decision-making process, <b>Commission</b> <b>monitoring</b> and enforcement and the level of compatibility between EU policy requirements and existing domestic law (‘technical fit’). To test hypotheses, this dissertation combines a data set on the policy preferences supported by national delegates during the EU decision-making process with information on a country’s timely and correct implementation of specific directives’ provisions. The findings provide new insights regarding member states’ compliance with controversial EU directives and their provisions...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The study aims to {{identify}} and explain {{the relevance of the}} substantive law of the Judicial Commission in conducting supervision to judges with the principles of independent judicial power including the models used in monitoring the behavior of the Judicial Commission judges and the impact of monitoring the behavior of judges. The study was conducted in Jakarta the place of the Judicial Commission as the targeted institution because it focuses in supervising the activities of judges of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional. The type of research is empirical legal research through the three-level approaches of philosophy dogmatic and theoretical laws. The research sample was determined by purposive sampling technique. Data collection instruments used where interviews and documentation collection then analyzed qualitatively. Results of the study revealed that the substance of the law governing the authority of the Judicial Commission to supervise the activity of judges is broadly in line with the principle of independent judicial power except the setting of membership composition and procedures of decision making of Honorary Judges. This is potentially affecting the independence of the judicial power. Judicial Commission applies the eclectic model of supervision by combining the model of supervision preventive but not include the recruitment promotion and transfer limited repressive and limited external supervision models external quasi. The Model of Judicial <b>Commission</b> <b>monitoring</b> for the behavior of judges is not included in the checks and balances surveillance. The Supervision of the Judicial Commission for activity of judges is not implemented significantly in the form of supervisory authority especially the preventive acts the application of sanctions toward judges who violate the KEPPH human resources quantitatively and yustisiabelen sound impact. It is recommended to the government and the Parliament to change the Article 22 F par. 2 on the composition of 4 Commissioners and 3 justices to 3 Commissioners 3 justices and 3 elements of the society. Also it is recommended to amend the Law No. 18 of 2011 to expand the Judicial Commission oversight duties including the recruitment the promotion the transfer of judges and in order to confirm the existence of the Judicial Commission as an external supervisor. The consequence is that the place of the Judicial Commission should be moved to outside the chapter of the judicial authority. In order to improve more on the effectiveness of supervision the activity of judges it is necessary to have capacity building on the Judicial Commission. It is recommended to the government and parliament to significantly increase the budget of the Judicial Commission. Also the Judicial Commission should improve more on the coordination cooperation with the Supreme Court so that recommendation on more sanctions is effective...|$|E
40|$|STUDY ON THE INTERRELATION BETWEEN COMPOSITION AND CHEMISTRY OF DEW AND ATMOSPHERIC PHOTOCHEMICAL PROCESSES The general {{objective}} of this project was to evaluate {{the impact of the}} different sources of radicals generated in the atmosphere of the city of Santiago, thus getting to know their relation to the chemical composition of dew, fog and rain. The hypothesis proposed in this study is that dews can include substances of photochemical origin, which might lead to the generation of smog. After these substances have been deposited on surfaces, they can re-evaporate and start free-radical reactions associated to this type of pollution. Chemical composition of dew water and rain was systematically studied. Several continuous day and night monitoring campaigns were conducted. In 2004, 2005 and 2006 campaigns, NO 2, 03, HCHO, HONO and PAN levels were measured on a daily basis using monitors for automatic registration. Simultaneously, JO 1 D and JNO 2 photolysis constants were estimated using automatic photolysers. Photolysis constants were also estimated for HCHO, HONO. Production speeds of OH* radicals were estimated for each particular substance together with the total production of HO* and HOO* radicals and the total radical concentration. The predominance of HONO in the production on HO* radicals over the other substances is highlighted. Concentrations of [OH*] are elevated to about 1. 5 x 107 radicals per cm 3. HOOH levels were measured in dews and gas phase. These compounds are easily decomposed through various mechanisms. It was possible to stabilize water samples and determine the real levels in dew water. However, these levels are significantly lower than those foreseen by the equilibrium from gas-phase. Its importance is related to the oxidation processes of species containing S(IV), thus contributing to the acidity of hydrometeors (SO 2 to SO 42 -). Likewise, the incorporation of nitrous acid, peroxides and formaldehyde to dew water and their impact in the generation of photochemical smog was assessed, and the percentage of pollutant removed was estimated. Between 3. 6 and 1. 9 % of HOOH; 22 and 10 % of HONO; and 7 and 13 % of HCHO was removed. Concentration levels in dews would be determined by levels in the gas-phase, but the equilibrium of both phases would not be achieved due to a kinetic-type factor. Carbonyl compounds are also present in Santiago’s atmosphere. Their primary and/or secondary origin was determined. Formaldehyde is mainly from a secondary or photochemical origin (72 %). Ozone and PAN, due to their photochemical origin, reach their highest concentrations in periods with high solar irradiation (spring and summer). However, high concentrations of PAN are found in Santiago during autumn. PAN’s thermic stability together with the high atmospheric stability and lower heights of the mixture layer during autumn months would explain the high concentration levels measured in periods of low solar irradiation. Finally, during 2006 and 2007, street level CO and CO 2 levels were measured in pavements with high vehicle traffic in downtown Santiago. Likewise, CO measurements were taken at different heights, from 1 m to 127 m, at ENTEL Chile’s corporate building. In the morning hours, CO values in these measurements were above the levels informed by CONAMA’s (National Environmental <b>Commission)</b> <b>monitoring</b> system, but were never above air quality standards for Santiago. CO vertical profiles were adjusted to dispersion models: Street Canyon and Gridded. Simultaneous CO and CO 2 measurements obtained in Santiago’s central streets and urban tunnels showed that their levels are closely correlated, thus allowing discriminating the type of mobile source associated to each sampling site and validating the inventory of emissions for Santiago.
