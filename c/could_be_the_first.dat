5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision {{that he would}} sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley {{played a major role in}} selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E

25|$|On 8 June 2016, the -300 was rolled-out in Irkutsk, East Siberia, {{six years}} after program launch and with 175 orders. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{commercial}} aircraft with an out of autoclave composite manufacturing for its wings. The program faces domination of the single-aisle market by Airbus and Boeing and Russian protectionism hampering critical western suppliers for the avionics, landing gear, hydraulics, power systems and engines. Its introduction was delayed {{to the end of}} 2018. It is intended to rival the Airbus A320neo or Boeing 737 MAX and will replace the outgoing Tu-134, Tu-154, Tu-204 and Yak-42.|$|E
25|$|The Roman <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{piece of}} non-Celtic vernacular {{literature}} {{to have survived}} from Scotland, an honour often thought {{to belong to the}} Brus of John Barbour, written one and a half centuries later in Middle English. It has been neglected in Scotland mainly because it did not come to the attention of scholars until relatively recently, being preserved only in Continental Europe. The other reason for neglect is probably that it was written in French, a linguistic-literary tradition which died out by the later Middle Ages. The Roman de Fergus however shows that, despite its future, French-culture flourished in Scotland during the High Middle Ages.|$|E

Paintings of seals from the Paleolithic and post-Paleolithic eras found in the Nerja Caves and attributed to Neanderthals may be about 42,000 years old and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> known works of art, according to José Luis Sanchidrián of the University of Córdoba.|$|E
25|$|Some {{modifications}} to STV {{have been proposed}} in order to pass monotonicity and other criteria. The most common method of proposed modification to STV is to alter {{the order in which}} candidates are eliminated: theoretically, a candidate who ranked second on every ballot <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> candidate eliminated even if he is a Condorcet winner. Meek noted this problem in proposing his variation of transferring votes to nearly eliminate tactical voting in STV, however Meek himself did not propose a method for satisfying the Condorcet criterion. Other theorists have proposed further refinements of STV, such as using a Condorcet method to rank candidates for elimination order. Some of these modifications alter STV in a way such that it no longer reduces to instant-runoff voting when applied to a single seat but instead reduces to some other single winner system, such as a Condorcet method.|$|E
25|$|Many {{thought it}} would be {{impossible}} to duplicate 50 in 50. Then, in the 1980–81 season, Mike Bossy of the New York Islanders became only the second player to score 50 goals in 50 games. The hockey press promoted this heavily, as Bossy was in an unofficial competition with Charlie Simmer of the Los Angeles Kings (see below) to see who <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to accomplish the 50-in-50 milestone since Richard. Both players played their fiftieth game on January 24, 1981: Simmer started the day with 46 goals and Bossy 48. Simmer scored a hat trick against Boston, giving him 49 goals in 50 games, just missing the mark. Making his game against the Quebec Nordiques, particularly dramatic, Bossy was scoreless for much of the game but beat goaltender Ron Grahame twice within the last five minutes of the game. Richard was on hand to congratulate Bossy for this achievement. Bossy finished the season with 68 goals in 79 games played.|$|E

25|$|While the {{achievements}} of space programs run by the main Asian space players (China, India, and Japan) {{pale in comparison to}} the milestones set by the former Soviet Union and the United States, some experts believe Asia may soon lead the world in space exploration. China has been the leader of Asia's space race {{since the beginning of the}} 21st century. The first Chinese manned spaceflight, in 2003, marked the beginning of a space race in the region. At the same time, the existence of a space race in Asia is still debated due to the non-concurrence of space milestone events like there was for the United States and the Soviet Union. Japan for example was the first power on Earth to get a sample return mission from an asteroid. There was however some concurrence between China and India to see which of those two <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to launch a probe to the Earth's moon back in the late 2000s decade. China, for example, denies that there is an Asian space race.|$|E
500|$|World Painted Blood {{marked the}} first time that the band wrote {{material}} in the studio rather than entering the studio fully prepared with lyrics. The fact that they were not prepared made guitarist Kerry King skeptical. King related: [...] "I was kind of thinking, 'Man, this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> record in a long time that's got a little bit of filler,'" [...] he acknowledges. [...] "But I think every song came out great. I was concerned some would sound similar, and every one is completely different. It's cool how it worked out." [...] The majority of the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. Kerry King stated: [...] "I like when Jeff writes as much as he did for this record. When you have one guy doing most of the writing you only get one perspective. A lot of Jeff's stuff has a very punky vibe this time; the stuff I write sounds thrashy but with a hint of punk, and when Jeff writes the stuff is more punk with a hint of thrash. It works together well." [...] Unlike 2006's Christ Illusion, the band was [...] "under-ready" [...] with their lyrics and music.|$|E
500|$|On September 4, 2013, Rivals.com updated their ranking with Jones {{slipping}} from 2nd to 5th (behind Emmanuel Mudiay, Johnson and Alexander) {{and the top}} {{point guard}} position to second (behind Mudiay). Rivals clarified that Okafor and Jones, who are considered a package deal, had visited Baylor together and would visit both Kansas and Duke together, but that they would visit Kentucky separately. On September 13, class of 2014 point guard Tyler Ulis committed to Kentucky. Subsequently, Jones canceled his September 2729 visit to Kentucky. As Okafor and Jones visited Kansas and Duke together {{during the last two}} weekends of October, those two schools were considered the favorites for the services of both. At Kansas, head coach Bill Self scheduled a second open practice for the weekend of the Okafor/Jones visit. ESPN.com's number 14 overall prospect Winslow attended Duke for an official visit the same weekend that Okafor and Jones did. [...] At the beginning of October, rumors began that Jones and Okafor would meet in a nationally televised game on December 12 that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> regular season high school basketball game ever broadcast on ESPN from Minnesota.

Perry Nemiroff of Cinema Blend speculated that Tron 3 <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> installment in a new trilogy. On January 13, 2011, Ain't It Cool News reported that the film was close to having its sequel announced as part of Disney's plan for Tron future. On January 21, 2011, Tron-Sector reported an unsourced rumor that a sequel to Tron: Legacy had been green-lit and a teaser trailer would debut on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of Tron and Tron: Legacy. Harry Knowles reported on the teaser, calling it a [...] "DVD Extra" [...] and noting that it had been filmed before Thanksgiving (i.e. before November 2010). On April 8, 2011, director Joseph Kosinski talked about the sequel: [...] "We're working on the story right now. Once we get a script we're all really happy with, we'll take it to the powers that be and see if we can go back to the grid. I think we will pick up with where Tron: Legacy left off with Sam and Quorra in the real world and what does that mean and the possibilities it opens up for the next chapter. It's that relationship between the two of them that's the next step." [...] On March 31, Kosinski said that the film's script was expected to be finished in two weeks and its working title is Tr3n.|$|E

2500|$|... "Tears of Rage" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{acclaimed}} songs from The Basement Tapes. [...] Gill likens it to King Lear's soliloquy on the blasted heath in Shakespeare's tragedy: [...] "Wracked with bitterness and regret, its narrator reflects upon promises broken and truths ignored, on how greed has poisoned the well of best intentions, and how even daughters can deny their father's wishes." [...] He suggests that Dylan is linking the anguish of Lear's soliloquy to the divisions in American society apparent in 1967, as the Vietnam War escalated: [...] "In its narrowest and most contemporaneous interpretation, the song <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to register the pain of betrayal felt by many of America's Vietnam war veterans. … In a wider interpretation [...] harks back to what anti-war protesters and critics of American materialism in general felt was a more fundamental betrayal of the American Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights." [...] A strong Biblical theme runs through this song, according to Griffin, who notes that [...] "life is brief" [...] is a recurrent message in the Old Testament books Psalms and Isaiah. As a father, Dylan realizes now that [...] "no broken heart hurts more than the broken heart of a distraught parent." [...] Griffin calls the four minutes of this song [...] "as representative of community, ageless truths and the unbreakable bonds of family as anything in the Band's canon—or anyone else's canon." ...|$|E

Soaplife said that Kat never has her mobile out of her hand, so when Kim catches Ray texting a mystery woman, it could mean that he is texting Kat.
