The first larval case is {{constructed}} from a <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>area</b> of an oval mine in {{the centre of the}} leaf. The second and third cases are cut out of a mine along the leaf margin. The final case is 6-7 mm long, with a bivalved, square-cut rear end. The mouth angle is about 45°. The larvae can be found from August to May in most of the range, but hibernate twice in Denmark.|$|E

The incident resulted in Treacy having to <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> an <b>area</b> of his leg as this was before protease inhibitor treatments for AIDS existed.

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{accessories}} {{are provided with}} the rifle, including a blade-type bayonet (AKM clipped point or the AK-74 spear point bayonet), four spare magazines, a leather or nylon sling, magazine pouch, cleaning kit and an accessory/maintenance kit for the telescopic sight. Also included is a cold weather battery case with a [...] "shirt clip", with a permanently attached cord 24" [...] long ending with another battery case cap that has an extension to press against the internal contact {{in lieu of the}} battery to complete the circuit. Placing the external battery case into the shooters' clothing close to the body keeps it from freezing; using the clip ensures it remains in place. The clamp-style bipod attaches to machined-out reliefs near the front of the receiver, it literally grabs the two <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>areas</b> and securely mounts with a large round sized head on the clamp bolt able to tightly attach the bipod. The legs are individually adjustable opposed to fixed length found on many rifles and LMG's and can be folded and stowed in a forward position negating the need to remove the bipod before placing the rifle into the canvas carrying case. Interestingly enough, the two legs are held close together with a [...] "J" [...] shaped clamp attached to one leg and swung over the other leg. Original Soviet/Russian SVD bipods fetch a very high price when they rarely appear on the market.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to write a java program that can read the data of OpenStreetMap and {{automatically}} finds the information to create the traffic network out of those data.

With the given data, the program will calculate how much inhabitants are statistically living in every residential building. The information that were read from the data, should be pointed to the closest traffic nodes. To do that, we tested several algorithms for example to find the shortest routes in the traffic network. In the end, we took the algorithm of Floyd and Warshall to find the shortest routes. With the given data, the traffic should be calculated with different methodes. After all the calculations, the traffic network and the traffic on the traffic network was visualized. The program was written so, that you can <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> an <b>area</b> of the OpenStreetMap data and the program will then do all the steps to calculate everything...|$|R
50|$|Lacrosse gloves {{are heavily}} padded, {{protective}} gloves worn by men's lacrosse players. The gloves {{are designed to}} protect players' hands, wrists, and forearms from checks, or legal defensive hitting common in the sport. Gloves consist of thick padding {{on the back of}} the hand and forearm covered in leather or canvas material, and a palm area made of synthetic and mesh material. A goaltender's gloves may have extra padding for the thumb to protect against injury from shots. While NCAA collegiate rules require that men's gloves have palms covered, other leagues, including post-collegiate club lacrosse, the National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse, and international play, permit players to <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> the palm <b>area</b> for greater grip and control of the lacrosse stick.|$|R

25|$|The {{origin of}} the use of these <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> is not known. It may extend back to the pre Hispanic period, but there are now 16th century chronicles documenting the practice.

Many of the religious concepts related to the <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> do have pre Hispanic roots. However, during the colonial period, the Otomi, especially of San Pablito were accused numerous times of witchcraft involving the use of <b>cut</b> <b>outs.</b> Today, some <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> figures are being reinterpreted and sold as handcraft products or folk art, and the use of industrial paper for ritual is common as well. <b>Cut</b> <b>outs</b> made for sale often relate to gods of agriculture, which are less called upon in ritual.

2500|$|While the Nahua {{paintings}} {{remain the}} most important craft form related to amate paper, the Otomi have adopted their elaborate <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> figures to the commercial market as well. This began with shamans creating booklets with miniature <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> of gods with handwritten explanations. Eventually, these began to sell and this success led to their commercialization in markets in Mexico City, were the Otomi connected with the Nahua in the 1960s. The Otomi still sell <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> in traditional designs, but have also experimented with newer designs, paper sizes, colors and types of paper. These <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> include depictions of various gods, especially those related to beans, coffee, corn, pineapples, tomatoes and rain. However, these <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> are not 100% authentic, with exact replicas still reserved to shamans for ritual purposes. Innovation has included the development of books, and <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> of suns, flowers, birds, abstract designs from traditional beadwork and even Valentine hearts with painted flowers. Most <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> are made of one type of paper, then glued onto a contrasting background. Their sizes range from miniatures in booklets to sizes large enough to frame and hang like a painting. [...] The production and sale of these paper products have brought tourism to San Pablito, mostly from Hidalgo, Puebla and Mexico City, but some come from the far {{north and south of}} Mexico and even from abroad.|$|R
