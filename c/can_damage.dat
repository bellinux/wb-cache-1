5|$|Cicadas feed on sap; {{they do not}} bite or sting in a true sense, but may {{occasionally}} mistake a person's arm for a plant {{limb and}} attempt to feed. Male cicadas produce very loud calls that <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> human hearing.|$|E
5|$|VSWR is the {{conventional}} means of expressing the match {{of a radio}} transmitter to its antenna. It is an important parameter because power reflected back into a high power transmitter <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> its output circuitry.|$|E
5|$|Advanced {{methods of}} loading were not {{foreseen}} when the ships were designed. While the new processes are more efficient, loading {{is more difficult}} to control (it can take over an hour just to halt the operation), occasionally resulting in overloading the ship. These unexpected shocks, over time, <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> the hull's structural integrity.|$|E

50|$|Retinal <b>damage</b> <b>can</b> {{occur when}} the eye is exposed to high luminance. <b>Damage</b> <b>can</b> occur due to local heating of the retina. Photochemical effects <b>can</b> also cause <b>damage,</b> {{especially}} at short wavelengths.|$|R
50|$|Clockwork <b>damage</b> <b>can</b> be inflicted via over-winding, {{interaction}} with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured {{prior to the}} clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum <b>can</b> itself be <b>damaged</b> and <b>can</b> inflict <b>damage</b> onto other interior components during such clock movement.|$|R
5|$|Bouldering <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> {{vegetation}} {{that grows}} on rocks, such as mosses and lichens. This can {{occur as a}} result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer. The repeated use of white climbing chalk <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> the rock surface of boulders and cliffs, particularly sandstone and other porous rock types, and the scrubbing of rocks to remove chalk can also degrade the rock surface. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Gritters {{are among}} the winter service {{vehicles}} also used in airports, to keep runways free of ice. However, the salt normally used to clear roads <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> the airframe of aircraft and interferes with the sensitive navigation equipment. As a result, airport gritters spread less dangerous potassium acetate or urea onto the runways instead, as these do not corrode the aircraft or the airside equipment.|$|E
5|$|Helminths {{known to}} infest weasels include the {{trematode}} Alaria, the nematodes Capillaria, Filaroides and Trichinella and the cestode Taenia. Least weasels are commonly {{infected with the}} nematode Skrjabingylus nasicola, adults of which {{are found in the}} nasal sinuses and <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> the skull. There is no evidence that this has serious detrimental effects on even heavily infested animals.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{damage is}} {{considered}} to be the primary underlying cause of cancer. If DNA repair is deficient, <b>damage</b> <b>can</b> accumulate. Such <b>damage</b> <b>can</b> cause mutational errors during DNA replication due to error-prone translesion synthesis. Accumulated <b>damage</b> <b>can</b> also cause epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to cancer (see malignant neoplasms).|$|R
50|$|Shock {{and impact}} {{are not the}} only hazards that <b>can</b> cause <b>damage,</b> Vibration, puncture, compression, etc. <b>can</b> also cause <b>damage</b> yet would not trigger a shock detector.|$|R
25|$|Hepatotoxicity (liver <b>damage)</b> <b>can</b> {{be caused}} by many {{cytotoxic}} drugs. The susceptibility of an individual to liver <b>damage</b> <b>can</b> be altered by other {{factors such as the}} cancer itself, viral hepatitis, immunosuppression and nutritional deficiency. The liver <b>damage</b> <b>can</b> consist of <b>damage</b> to liver cells, hepatic sinusoidal syndrome (obstruction of the veins in the liver), cholestasis (where bile does not flow from the liver to the intestine) and liver fibrosis.|$|R
5|$|Lead {{has been}} used for bullets since their {{invention}} in the Middle Ages. It is inexpensive; its low melting point means small arms ammunition and shotgun pellets can be cast with minimal technical equipment; and it is denser than other common metals, which allows for better retention of velocity. Concerns have been raised that lead bullets used for hunting <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> the environment.|$|E
5|$|Local economies near major {{coral reefs}} {{benefit from an}} {{abundance}} of fish and other marine creatures as a food source. Reefs also provide recreational scuba diving and snorkeling tourism. These activities <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> coral but international projects such as Green Fins that encourage dive and snorkel centres to follow a Code of Conduct have been proven to mitigate these risks.|$|E
5|$|Oil-shale {{extraction}} <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> {{the biological}} and recreational value of land and the ecosystem in the mining area. Combustion and thermal processing generate waste material. In addition, the atmospheric emissions from oil shale processing and combustion include carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Environmentalists oppose production and usage of oil shale, as it creates even more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels.|$|E
50|$|Populus trichocarpa has an {{extensive}} and aggressive root system, which <b>can</b> invade and <b>damage</b> drainage systems. Sometimes the roots <b>can</b> even <b>damage</b> {{the foundations of}} buildings by drying out the soil.|$|R
50|$|Microwave <b>damage</b> <b>can</b> {{manifest}} with a delay; pain and/or {{signs of}} skin <b>damage</b> <b>can</b> show {{some time after}} microwave exposure.|$|R
50|$|The leaves <b>can</b> be <b>damaged</b> by rust fungi.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{any other}} species of Siricidae, the Sirex {{woodwasp}} <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> relatively healthy trees so heavily, they die back. However, the wasp mainly infests weakened trees; only when the population is high does the insect also attack intact and healthy trees. Because the wasp larvae and the fungus need healthy wood, the Sirex woodwasp does not infest dry or dead timber. However, wasps may hatch from processed wood which was already infested.|$|E
5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication between individuals, {{and an ability}} to solve complex problems. These parallels with human {{societies have}} long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{regularly}} receives {{cold air}} from the south that can reach low latitudes owing {{to the influence of}} the Andes. Cold waves are usually accompanied with severe snowstorms or extremely cold conditions that can have a devastating impact on the country's economy. These snowstorms and/or extremely cold conditions can partially or completely paralyze activities in large areas of Patagonia and the center of the country. In addition, cold conditions can lead to energy shortages during the winter months due to increased demand. The low temperatures brought by these cold waves can cause frosts that <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> plants, severely affecting agricultural production and devastating the local economy.|$|E

5|$|Butterflies {{are often}} polymorphic, and many species {{make use of}} camouflage, mimicry and aposematism to evade their predators. Some, like the monarch and the painted lady, migrate over long distances. Many {{butterflies}} are attacked by parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies (e.g., harvesters) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of ants, while others live as mutualists in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{exposed to}} {{ionizing}} radiation, ultraviolet light or chemicals {{are prone to}} acquire multiple sites of bulky DNA lesions and double-strand breaks. Moreover, DNA damaging agents <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> other biomolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and RNA. The accumulation of damage, to be specific, double-strand breaks or adducts stalling the replication forks, are among known stimulation signals for a global response to DNA damage. The global response to damage is an act directed toward the cells' own preservation and triggers multiple pathways of macromolecular repair, lesion bypass, tolerance, or apoptosis. The common features of global response are induction of multiple genes, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cell division.|$|E
5|$|It also tolerates {{a variety}} of soil conditions. Although young {{specimens}} perform best when planted {{in a mixture of}} peat and either sand or perlite, P.atriplicifolia can thrive in sandy, chalky, or loamy soil, or heavy clay soil with sufficient drainage. It can endure a wide range of soil pH, as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding taproot makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. P.atriplicifolia is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant.|$|E

5|$|Kidney damage {{occurs with}} {{exposure}} {{to high levels}} of lead, and evidence suggests that lower levels <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> kidneys as well. The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired. Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause lead nephropathy have also been reported as nephrotoxic in patients from developed countries that had chronic kidney disease or were at risk because of hypertension or diabetes mellitus.|$|E
5|$|Most {{available}} berkelium toxicity data {{originate from}} research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% berkelium {{ends in the}} blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20years), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries where berkelium stays indefinitely. The balance of about 10% is excreted. In all these organs berkelium might promote cancer, and in the skeletal system its radiation <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> red blood cells. The maximum permissible amount of berkelium-249 in the human skeleton is 0.4nanograms.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} active volcanoes in the Aleutian Arc, Cleveland has erupted at least 22times in the last 230years. A VEI 3 {{eruption}} in 1944 produced the arc's only known volcanic fatality. Most recently Mount Cleveland has erupted three times in 2009, twice in 2010, once in 2011 and in 2016 and 2017. The volcano's remoteness limits opportunities for its study, and the Alaska Volcano Observatory relies heavily on satellites for monitoring. The volcano is primarily hazardous to aircraft; many of the flights over the north Pacific approach the vicinity of the volcano, and volcanic ash released from eruptions <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> sensitive electronic equipment and sensors.|$|E
