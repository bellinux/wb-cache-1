5|$|In general, La Niña {{events are}} {{associated}} with lower temperatures (particularly colder winters) in the Pampas. During winter, frosts are more common during La Niña events compared to El Niño events. This {{is due to a}} stronger southerly flow during La Niña events caused by a higher concentration of high pressure systems in the South Pacific and an increase in cyclonic activity (more low pressure systems) in the South Atlantic. This creates conditions that are favourable for bringing <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> from the south, particularly when there is a formation of a high pressure system over Patagonia (associated with the passage of a front) that is responsible for bringing <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> from the south. Thus, invasions of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> from the south are more common during La Niña events. In contrast, warm spells in the Pampas and northern parts of the country are more intense and frequent during El Niño events. This is due to stronger westerly winds south of 40oS, leading to less frequent incursions of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> from the south while enhancing winds from the north that bring in warm air. Although La Niña events lead to colder winters with more frequent incursions of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> in both the north and central parts of the country, it leads to more frequent and intense warm spells in the last months of the year. In other regions, El Niño events lead to more frequent and intense warm spells in Northwest Argentina (during autumn), northeast Argentina (during spring) and central Argentina (during summer). <b>Cold</b> <b>air</b> anomalies arising from El Niño events are observed during spring and are the result of an increase in rainfall that lead to reductions in insolation. For the southern parts of the country, El Niño events {{are associated with}} more intense and frequent cold spells during the coldest months. In summer, El Niño events are associated with warmer summer temperatures in the southern parts of the country.|$|E
5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} slant {{back into}} <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> masses and strengthen with height, sometimes exceeding 30,000feet (approximately 9km) in depth.|$|R
25|$|For example, in extra-tropical {{cyclones}} the air circulating {{around a}} pressure low typically {{comes with a}} sector of warmer temperature wedged within <b>colder</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
50|$|These ice {{crystals}} usually form when a temperature inversion is {{present at the}} surface and the warmer air above the ground mixes with the <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> near the surface. Since warmer air frequently contains more water vapor than <b>colder</b> <b>air,</b> this mixing will usually also transport water vapor into the air near the surface, causing the relative humidity of the near-surface air to increase. If the relative humidity increase near the surface is large enough then {{ice crystals}} may form.|$|R
5|$|An active trough of low {{pressure}} exited the East Coast of the United States on May 12, {{and by the}} following day it passed near Bermuda. Initially the trough was located only near the surface, though as <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> from behind it advanced eastward, the trough extended into the mid- to upper-levels of the atmosphere. By May 14 a closed {{low pressure}} area developed in seclusion from the westerlies. Continued <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> from behind the trough, about 12°F (7°C) colder than usual for the time of year, extended across the low in conjunction with warm upper levels and warm sea surface temperatures, resulting in large amounts of instability. The polar trough gradually weakened as the low organized, and on May 15 it developed into a subtropical depression while located about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} tracked across southeastern Canada during the 12th, which brought an arctic front across the Mid Atlantic region {{late on the}} 12th. As this occurred, a strong area of high pressure located across central Canada built down into the Northeast, allowing very <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> to spill southward ultimately leading to what is known as <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> damming. This occurs east of the mountains down through the Mid Atlantic states. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm slammed onto the California coast during the 11th and as it moved eastward, a new area of {{low pressure}} developed across southeastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>air</b> {{from the}} {{remnants}} of a cold front became entrained within the circulation; however, the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> gradually warmed. On October9, winds increased to gale-force and the depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm, at which time it was given the name Bravo. By October10, Bravo had intensified substantially, as hurricane hunters recorded hurricane-force winds roughly 15mi (25km) {{from the center of the}} storm. Following this finding, the National Hurricane Center reclassified the system as a tropical system and renamed it Fran, dropping its previous designation of Bravo. Upon becoming tropical, Fran developed a strong outflow and several convective feeder bands. Additionally, the storm had developed a 35mi (55km) wide eye.|$|E
60|$|Asano led the {{way along}} the gallery across the dancing hall. Presently {{they came to a}} {{transverse}} passage that brought a breath of fresher, <b>colder</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
50|$|Associated with {{a thermal}} is a {{downward}} flow surrounding the thermal column. The downward-moving exterior {{is caused by}} <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> being displaced {{at the top of}} the thermal.|$|R
5000|$|Door closers {{also play}} a role in {{maintaining}} average cooling temperatures, since <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> does not vent out for longer periods if the door remains closed for longer periods on average.|$|R
5|$|Lake-effect snow is {{produced}} during cooler atmospheric conditions when a <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> mass moves across long expanses of warmer lake water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake, rises {{up through the}} colder air above, freezes and is deposited on the leeward (downwind) shores.|$|E
5|$|October 9, 1804 — Heavy snow {{falls in}} Eastern New York peaking at 30 inches (75 cm) as a {{hurricane}} tracks northward along the East Coast and becomes extratropical, as <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> {{fed into the}} system.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} the Patagonian region is {{influenced}} both by the close distance to Antarctica and by the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies. Polar <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> outbreaks, cool ocean upwelling, orographic precipitation and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current further affect the regional climate.|$|E
25|$|During winter months, Thermal {{inversion}} (a {{meteorological phenomenon}} whereby a stable layer of warm <b>air</b> holds down <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> {{close to the}} ground) causes high levels of smog and air pollution to be trapped and concentrated within the Central Valley.|$|R
5000|$|Air masses {{are large}} bodies of air with similar {{properties}} of {{temperature and humidity}} that form over source regions. The warm air mass behind a warm front is not only warmer, but often (but not always) also higher in humidity than the <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> preceding it. Because of a warm air mass’s higher temperature and thus lesser density, mixing between the two air masses is unlikely. Being light, the warm air mass is unable to displace the cooler air mass and instead is forced upward along the upper boundary of the <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> in {{a process known as}} overrunning. The boundary between the two air masses has a gradual slope of 1:200 and lifting is slow but persistent.|$|R
50|$|Blue paloverde trees (Parkinsonia florida), {{with smooth}} blue-green {{photosynthetic}} bark, and yellow paloverde (Parkinsonia microphylla) {{are in the}} a legume family (Fabaceae). There are extensive stands of velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina) in the valleys of the Arizona Upland, where <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> collects.|$|R
5|$|The strongest {{high-pressure}} {{areas are}} associated with <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> masses which push away out of polar regions during the winter when there is less sun to warm neighboring regions. These Highs change character and weaken once they move further over relatively warmer water bodies.|$|E
5|$|They form {{over large}} lakes and oceans during <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> {{outbreaks}} while {{the water is}} still relatively warm, and {{can be an important}} mechanism in vertically transporting moisture. They are a component of sea smoke.|$|E
5|$|Associated with jet streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear-air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear caused by jet streams. The CAT is strongest on the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> side of the jet, next to and just under the axis of the jet. Clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents, such as {{the death of one}} passenger on United Airlines Flight 826.|$|E
50|$|The {{location}} of the Rhodopes in the southeastern part of the Balkan Peninsula determines the climate {{in the region to}} a great extent. It is influenced both by the <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> coming from the north and by the warmer breeze from the Mediterranean.|$|R
50|$|The {{lower end}} of the garden is {{accessed}} by an iron gate to Cedar Avenue allowing <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> and moisture {{to move out of the}} garden avoiding the creation of frost pockets which could damage tender plants or reduce the growing season.|$|R
50|$|The storm allowed frigid air {{bottled up}} {{in much of}} western Canada and Alaska to flow south and overspread the United States, with sub-zero (°F) highs in the {{northern}} Plains. The <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> later reached {{the eastern half of}} the United States with much lesser impact.|$|R
5|$|Buenos Aires {{is located}} in the humid {{subtropical}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification: Cfa). Due to the maritime influences from the adjoining Atlantic Ocean, its climate is temperate with extreme temperatures (both hot and cold) being rare. Thus, <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> coming directly from the south are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and warmer than winds from the southwest (which are not moderated by it).|$|E
5|$|In {{the cases}} of Lake-effect snow and polar lows, the {{convective}} systems form over warm water bodies when <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> sweeps over their surface and leads {{to an increase in}} moisture and significant vertical motion. This vertical motion leads to the development of showers and thunderstorms in areas of cyclonic flow on the backside of extratropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|January 24, 2003: A {{plume of}} Arctic air {{produces}} widespread record low temperatures and light snow flurries {{along the eastern}} coastline. The snow is described as ocean-effect snow, identical to lake effect snow in that it occurs due to very <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> passing over relatively warm water temperatures. The snow reaches {{as far south as}} Fort Pierce.|$|E
50|$|The Hadley system {{provides}} an example of a heat engine. The Hadley circulation is identified with rising of warm and moist air in the equatorial region with descent of <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> in the subtropics corresponding to a thermally driven direct circulation, with consequent net production of kinetic energy.|$|R
50|$|The urban heat {{island effect}} {{tends to be}} {{stronger}} in winter because the <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> above the city is less able to rise by convection to allow the hot air inside the city to escape into the atmosphere. The effect is greater at night for the same reason.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{of these}} dryers have [...] "normal mode" [...] buttons that {{turn off the}} heater and blow room-temperature air while the button is pressed. This {{function}} helps to maintain the hairstyle by setting it. The <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> reduces frizz and can help to bolster shine in the hair.|$|R
5|$|These {{can occur}} in sea breezes or in desert regions. In a sea-breeze front, <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> from the sea meets the warmer air from the land and creates a {{boundary}} between two masses of air like a shallow cold front. Glider pilots can gain altitude by flying along the intersection {{as if it were}} a ridge of land. Convergence may occur over considerable distances and so may permit virtually straight flight while climbing.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the year, the South Pacific High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to move, this high pressure system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east of the Andes and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier of the Andes, it forces and channels the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> to accumulate on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the Coriolis force caused by accumulation of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> on the eastern side of the Andes) that draw this <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. <b>Cold</b> <b>air</b> can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect of the Andes is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east of the Andes (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E
5|$|Warm fronts are at {{the leading}} edge of a {{homogeneous}} warm air mass, which is located on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lie within broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts. A warm front moves more slowly than the cold front which usually follows because <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> is denser and harder to remove from the Earth's surface.|$|E
50|$|Rain can be torrential, {{particularly}} in the autumn, when storms and rain are caused by {{the difference between the}} <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> inland and the warm Mediterranean water temperature (20 - 24 C). The rainiest months are September (75.6 mm average rainfall); October (143.9 mm); November (94.3 mm) and December (87.8 mm).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{relation}} between the latitude of Sunspots and the deviation of the mean air temperature was described, i. e. in the period of (±) positive latitude of Sunspots, the air temperature is higher or warmer than the mean air temperature and (—) negative latitude brings lower or <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> temperature. ...|$|R
500|$|Autumn {{weather in}} Minnesota {{is marked by}} the rapid {{decrease}} of severe thunderstorms, dramatic cooling, and eventually the possibility of blizzards. With summer-time heat still prevalent in the southern U.S. and <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> quickly taking hold in Canada, Minnesota can be affected by wide temperature swings in short periods of time. [...] Because of this, the jet stream, which tends to weaken during the summer months, begins to re-strengthen. [...] This leads to quicker changes in weather patterns and increasingly strong storm systems. [...] As autumn moves on, these storm systems bring with them progressively <b>colder</b> <b>air,</b> eventually changing the rain over snow, generally starting in October {{in the northern part}} of the state and November in the south. From September to December the average temperature in the state falls by approximately 43°F (23°C), the largest such temperature swing within any Minnesota season.|$|R
