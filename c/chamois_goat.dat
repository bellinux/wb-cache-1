50|$|The Oberhasli is {{a modern}} American breed of dairy goat. It derives from the subtype of <b>Chamois</b> Colored <b>Goat</b> from the Oberhasli {{district}} of the Bernese Oberland in central Switzerland. All purebred members of the breed descend from five <b>Chamois</b> Colored <b>Goats</b> imported to the United States in 1936. A breeder's association was formed in 1977, and a herdbook established in the following year. Until then, goats of this type had been known as Swiss Alpine, and interbred with Alpine goats of other types.|$|R

60|$|There are two {{or three}} courts in the castle, but of no great size. We were now led across one of them, and {{dismissed}} out of the arched entrance by which we had come in. We found the gendarme still keeping watch on his roofed drawbridge, and as there was the same gentle shower that had been effusing itself all the morning, we availed ourselves of the shelter, more especially as there were some curiosities to examine. These consisted chiefly of wood-carvings,--such as little figures in the national costume, boxes with wreaths of foliage upon them, paper knives, the <b>chamois</b> <b>goat,</b> admirably well represented. We at first hesitated to make any advances towards trade with the gendarme because it was Sunday, and we fancied {{there might be a}} Calvinistic scruple on his part about turning a penny on the Sabbath; but from the little I know of the Swiss character, I suppose they would be as ready as any other men to sell, not only such matters, but even their own souls, or any smaller--or shall we say greater--thing on Sunday or at any other time. So we began to ask the prices of the articles, and met with no difficulty in purchasing a salad spoon and fork, with pretty bas-reliefs carved on the handles, and a napkin-ring. For Rosebud's and our amusement, the gendarme now set a musical-box a-going; and as it played a pasteboard figure of a dentist began to pull the tooth of a pasteboard patient, lifting the wretched simulacrum entirely from the ground, and keeping him in this horrible torture for half an hour. Meanwhile, mamma, Miss Shepard, U----, and J----- sat down all in a row on a bench and sketched the mountains; and as the shower did not cease, though the sun most of the time shone brightly, they were kept actual prisoners of Chillon much longer than we wished to stay.|$|E

It is unknown whether {{a significant number of}} leopards still exist in Anatolia. Extensive trophy hunting is thought to be the prime factor for the decline and possible extinction of the Anatolian leopard. One hunter named Mantolu Hasan killed at least fifteen leopards between 1930 and 1950.|$|R
50|$|The {{association}} maintains genealogical herdbooks for seventeen principal breeds of sheep, {{of which}} eight - the Altamurana, Comisana, Delle Langhe, Leccese, Massese, Pinzirita, Sarda and Valle del Belice - are milk breeds, and nine - the Appenninica, Barbaresca, Bergamasca, Biellese, Fabrianese, Gentile di Puglia, Laticauda, Merinizzata Italiana and Sopravissana - are meat breeds. It also maintains genealogical herd {{books for the}} eight principal goat breeds, the Camosciata delle Alpi or <b>Chamois</b> Coloured <b>Goat,</b> the Garganica, Girgentana, Jonica, Maltese, Orobica, Rossa Mediterranea, Saanen and Sarda.

50|$|The <b>Chamois</b> Coloured <b>Goat,</b> 'Chèvre chamoisée', 'Gämsfarbige Gebirgsziege', 'Camosciata delle Alpi', is an {{indigenous}} breed of domestic goat from Switzerland. It is distributed throughout Switzerland and {{in parts of}} northern Italy and Austria, and has been exported to other countries including France. There are two strains, a horned type from the Grisons or Graubünden {{in the eastern part}} of the country, and a hornless type from the former bezirk of Oberhasli and the area of Brienz and Lake Brienz in the Bernese Oberland in central Switzerland. In some countries the hornless variety may be considered a separate breed, the Oberhasli goat. The Swiss herd-book was established in 1930.|$|R

40|$|DNA was {{extracted}} from teeth and bones of Myotragus balearicus, a bovid that evolved in isolation on the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean) {{from the end}} of the Miocene, becoming extinct 4, 000 years BP, after the arrival of humans in the islands. The numerous morphological apomorphies of Myotragus, most strikingly its dwarfism, frontal eyes, and ever-growing incisors, obscure its phylogenetic relationships with extant bovids. Therefore, the recovery of genetic information from Myotragus is of significant interest to help clarify the taxonomic position of this species. In this study we amplified and sequenced a 95 bp (base pair) fragment of the mtDNA cytochrome b gene from 6, 000 -year-old specimens of Myotragus. Several experimental controls, such as amino acid analysis, independent reproduction in two different laboratories, and cloning of the PCR product, support the authenticity of the ancient DNA sequence recovered. Phylogenetic comparison with orthologous sequences from supposedly related extant genera (serow, goral, mountain <b>goat,</b> <b>chamois,</b> takin, sheep, <b>goat,</b> Himalayan tahr, arctic musk ox, barbary sheep, blue sheep, and saiga) from the Caprinae subfamily suggests that Myotragus is related to some of these species. However, the real phylogenetic position of Myotragus is difficult to assess, due to the lack of resolution of the present molecular study, which can be partially attributed to the short length of the genetic fragment recovered.

5000|$|The takin ( [...] ; Budorcas taxicolor; [...] ), {{also called}} cattle <b>chamois</b> or gnu <b>goat,</b> is a {{goat-antelope}} {{found in the}} eastern Himalayas. The four subspecies are: B. t. taxicolor, the Mishmi takin; B. t. bedfordi, the Shaanxi takin or golden takin; B. t. tibetana, the Tibetan or Sichuan takin; and B. t. whitei, the Bhutan takin. Whilst the takin {{has in the past}} been placed together with the muskox in the tribe Ovibovini, more recent mitochondrial research shows a closer relationship to Ovis (sheep). Its physical similarity to the muskox is therefore an example of convergent evolution. The takin is the national animal of Bhutan.|$|R
50|$|Environmentalists remain sceptical {{about the}} Khudoni HPP project. The sub-alpine forests and meadows {{of the upper}} river Inguri basin is an area well known for its endemic wildlife. The species that are often found here include {{different}} forest birds, large raptors and other endemic birds. Mountain <b>goats,</b> <b>chamois,</b> brown bear, wolf, lynx, roe deer and wild boar are also quite common. Flooding of the reservoir area will cause the devastation of forests and wildlife habitat, the loss of river species populations and the degradation of upstream catchments areas.

5000|$|There is also {{so called}} Northern Dzhendem or the Northern Djendem {{located on the}} north slope of Mount Botev [...] It was {{declared}} a Reserve on September 30, 1983. It has a total area of 16.1 km² and is the highest reserve in the Balkan Ranges, encompassing a wild and inaccessible section of {{the central part of}} the mountain. The reserve includes the nearly vertical northern slopes, approximately 10 kilometres wide with an average height of 900 metres, looming rock tiers, short and steep watersheds, overhanging cliffs, rock bridges, jaded cornices, deep precipices, numerous waterfalls, as well as grassy terraces. At low altitudes, ancient beech and fir forests cover almost two-thirds of the steeply sloped Northern Djendem. It also contains sub-alpine grassy and forest habitats. Many rare wildlife species have found their last refuge in this impenetrable natural forest, which is home to an unusual community of Siberian juniper, myrtle-leaf rhododendron and blueberry, as well as the only known location of Urumov’s campion in the world. The Northern Djendem is home to the Balkan <b>chamois</b> (alpine <b>goat),</b> brown bear, grey wolf, red deer, roe, golden eagle, peregrine falcon, and wallcreeper. The two Djendems are alpine objects for many climbers.|$|R
50|$|The {{forests are}} {{threatened}} by logging and mining, although {{it is impossible to}} get permits for large-scale mining in the Kahurangi. The karst limestone is particularly fragile and even damaged by recreational caving. The wildlife is threatened by introduced species but they are largely intact at higher elevations. Much of the ecoregion is protected within three national parks; the large Kahurangi National Park and Paparoa National Parks on the west coast, and Abel Tasman National Park on the north east coast. The coastline is unspoilt too and some of it, including Farewell Spit, is protected as nature reserves of national parks. Efforts are being made to control invasive introduced species, particularly possums although deer, <b>chamois,</b> hares and <b>goats</b> are also targeted for control. Birds eggs and snails are vulnerable to rats, possums, stoats and wild pigs. Forest fires are always a threat.|$|R
