5|$|Japan's air {{defenses}} {{were unable to}} stop the Allied air attacks. Owing to the short range of the country's land-based radar, and Allied attacks on IJN picket ships, the defenders typically had only about an hour to respond to incoming B-29s once they had been detected. Japanese signals intelligence units could provide longer warning times of incoming raids by eavesdropping on the bombers' radio communications, but were unable to predict {{the target of the}} attack. As a result, fighter units did not have enough time to scramble and reach the bombers' <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> before they arrived over their target, and most raids were intercepted by only small numbers of aircraft. Moreover, the American bombers were capable of flying faster at high altitude than many Japanese fighters. Even when the fighters managed to close within gun range, the well-built B-29s were often able to sustain large amounts of damage. Due to the difficulty of intercepting and downing B-29s, the Japanese fighter pilots increasingly perceived their efforts as being futile. From August 1944 Japanese aircraft occasionally conducted suicide ramming attacks on B-29s, and several specialized kamikaze fighter units were established in October; {{by the end of the}} war, ramming tactics had destroyed nine B-29s and damaged another 13 for the loss of 21 fighters.|$|E
25|$|On March 24, 2015, Germanwings Flight 9525, {{carrying}} 150 people (including six crewmembers), had a rapid {{descent from}} <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> approximately 45 minutes after takeoff. It crashed {{a few miles}} from the city, en route to Düsseldorf from Barcelona.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} restricting maximum <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude</b> {{on the mission}} {{performance}} of two supersonic transport concepts across a selection of cruise Mach numbers is studied. Results indicate that a trapezoidal wing concept can be competitive with an arrow wing depending on the altitude and Mach number constraints imposed. The higher wing loading of trapezoidal wing configurations gives them an appreciably lower average <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude</b> than the lower wing loading of the arrow wing configurations, and this advantage increases as the maximum allowable <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude</b> is reduced...|$|R
50|$|Pilots {{of small}} {{airplanes}} {{need to do}} a flight plan to compute fuel usage and time of the trip, because they don't have a flight management system. Because climbing to <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude</b> burns fuel quicker, the takeoff to <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude</b> is calculated separately. The airplane's Pilot Operating Handbook has a table of fuel burned, time, and distance to reach a given altitude from sea level. To calculate the values for airport at 3000 feet, you subtract the values for sea level to 3000 from the sea level to <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude.</b>|$|R

25|$|The flight {{had been}} delayed before departure, {{so at the}} time of the {{explosion}} the aircraft was not yet at <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> and the cabin was not yet fully pressurized. It was thought that a laptop had been rigged with a timer device to explode the bomb mid-flight.|$|E
25|$|The flight {{departed}} Værnes at 8:30. It {{climbed to}} a <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> of 2,500meters (8,000ft) and passed Tolga Radio Beacon at 09:12. In {{the area around}} Røros the aircraft started experiencing icing, which quickly rose to levels {{which could not be}} handled by the ice protection system. In addition, the aircraft was subject to a downdraft. The pilots therefore chose to turn the aircraft around and return to Trondheim. However, the icing was so aggressive that the aircraft continued to lose elevation. It was flying through a blizzard and there was poor sight, making navigation difficult.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the technical investigation, {{the selection of the}} flight route was also investigated by the DSB. There were 61 flight operators from 32 countries who flew over eastern Ukraine {{at the time of the}} crash, who believed it was safe to fly there at <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude.</b> In the DSB's opinion, there was sufficient reason to fully close the airspace over eastern Ukraine as a precaution. The DSB recommended that states involved in armed conflicts should exercise more caution when evaluating their airspace, and operators should more thoroughly assess the risks when selecting routes over conflict areas.|$|E
40|$|Aircraft fuel {{efficiency}} {{is a function}} of many different parameters, including characteristics of the engines, characteristics of the airframe, and the conditions under which the aircraft is operated. For a given vehicle, the airframe and engine characteristics are for the most part fixed quantities and efficiency is primarily a function of operational conditions. One important influence on cruise efficiency is <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude.</b> Various future scenarios have been postulated for <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude,</b> from the freedom to fly at optimum altitudes to altitude restrictions imposed for environmental reasons. This report provides background on the fundamental relationships determining aircraft cruise efficiency and examines the sensitivity of efficiency to <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude.</b> Analytical models of two current aircraft designs are used to derive quantitative results. Efficiency penalties are found to be generally less than 1 % when within roughly 2000 ft of the optimum <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude.</b> Even the restrictive scenario of constant <b>altitude</b> <b>cruise</b> is found to result in a modest fuel consumption penalty if the fixed altitude is in an appropriate range...|$|R
50|$|Another {{possible}} {{reduction of}} the climate-change impact is the limitation of <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude</b> of aircraft. This {{would lead to a}} significant reduction in high-altitude contrails for a marginal trade-off of increased flight time and an estimated 4% increase in CO2 emissions. Drawbacks of this solution include very limited airspace capacity to do this, especially in Europe and North America and increased fuel burn because jet aircraft are less efficient at lower <b>cruise</b> <b>altitudes.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{has been}} made of the random deviations from the <b>cruise</b> <b>altitudes</b> (called flight technical error) of a large turbojet transport on scheduled, passenger-carrying operations over the Eastern United States, the Atlantic Ocean, and Western Europe. Data were collected from l 9 O flights through an altitude range of 20, 000 to 41, 000 feet and for a time period from January to August 1959. The results of the investigation, based on an evaluation of the altitude recordings of an NASA VGH recorder, showed that for a high percentage of the total cruise time (99. 0 percent) the airplane operated within 100 feet of its stabilized <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude.</b> On occasion, however, the excursions of the airplane from the <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude</b> reached large values (in excess of 1, 000 feet in the worst case) ...|$|R
25|$|Interaction between ZNY and Flight 990 was {{completely}} routine. After takeoff, Flight 990 was handled by three different controllers as it climbed up in stages to its assigned <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude.</b> The aircraft, like all commercial airliners, {{was equipped with}} a Mode C transponder, which automatically reported the plane's altitude when queried by the ATC radar. At 01:44, the transponder indicated that Flight 990 had leveled off at FL330. Three minutes later, the controller requested that Flight 990 switch communications radio frequencies for better reception. A pilot on Flight 990 acknowledged on the new frequency. This was the last transmission received from the flight.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{climbed to}} its assigned <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> of 6,000 feet and left controlled airspace. The pilot kept {{in contact with}} ATC for information and advisory services. At 2359 h the controller noticed that the aircraft had not made its scheduled left turn toward Campbeltown. The controller asked the pilot to confirm his routing, and he advised the pilot that he was already west of his intended course. The pilot then made a sharp left turn to the southeast, followed by another to the southwest, toward Campbeltown. As the aircraft descended toward Campbeltown, {{it had not been}} on its approved course since it left the immediate vicinity of Glasgow.|$|E
25|$|The Agenzia Nazionale per la Sicurezza del Volo (ANSV) {{started an}} inquiry, {{following}} {{the recovery of}} the cockpit voice recorder a week after the crash. The flight data recorder was also recovered, and results from its decoded ribbon showed that the aircraft was flying at <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> with the autopilot engaged, that it got disengaged twelve seconds after the autopilot failure light lit, and that both directional and longitudinal control was lost moments later, with the aircraft crashing 73 seconds after the light came on.

25|$|The Dornier 328 (or Do 328) {{program was}} {{initially}} started while Dornier was still owned by Deutsche Aerospace. According to Deutsche Aerospace program manager Reinhold Birrenbach, the 328 had {{its origins in}} market research conducted in and around 1984; feedback from airlines indicated a desire for a fast, quiet and easy to maintain commuter airliner with a 30-seat capacity. This market research reportedly led Deutsche Aerospace to formulate a sales prediction of 400 or greater units being purchased overall; this forecast was in part derived from the reasoning that the 328 would be more advanced than its nearest competitors. Favourable features included a high cruising speed of 345 kt (640km/h) {{as well as a}} higher <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> and range, making the aircraft almost as fast as jet airliners while being more fuel-efficient; a trend away from spoke–and-hub distribution in favour of point-to-point transit was also viewed as being favourable to the 328.|$|E

40|$|Even {{though the}} hazard posed by lift-generated wakes of subsonic {{transport}} aircraft {{has been studied}} extensively for approach and departure at airports, {{only a small amount}} of effort has gone into the potential hazard at <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude.</b> This paper reports on a studio of the wake-vortex hazard during cruise because encounters may become more prevalent when free-flight becomes available and each aircraft, is free to choose its own route between destinations. In order to address the problem, the various fluid-dynamic stages that vortex wakes usually go through as they age will be described along with estimates of the potential hazard that each stage poses. It appears that a rolling-moment hazard can be just as severe at cruise as for approach at airports, but it only persists for several minutes. However, the hazard posed by the downwash in the wake due to the lift on the generator aircraft persists for tens of minutes in a long narrow region behind the generating aircraft. The hazard consists of severe vertical loads when an encountering aircraft crosses the wake. A technique for avoiding vortex wakes at <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude</b> will be described. To date the hazard posed by lift-generated vortex wakes and their persistence at <b>cruise</b> <b>altitudes</b> has been identified and subdivided into several tasks. Analyses of the loads to be encounter and are underway and should be completed shortly. A review of published literature on the subject has been nearly completed (see text) and photographs of vortex wakes at <b>cruise</b> <b>altitudes</b> have been taken and the various stages of decay have been identified.
