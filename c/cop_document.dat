30|$|It {{should be}} noted that the overall {{processes}} of the UNFCCC and the adopted Kyoto Protocol have been criticized by not having achieved its stated goals of reducing the emission of carbon dioxide as discussed above. The failure to achieve meaningful progress and reach effective CO 2 reducing-policy treaties among the parties over the past eighteen years have driven some countries like the US to never ratify the UNFCCC’s because according to US the treaty didn’t cover developing countries which some of them are now considered the largest CO 2 emitters. Other air polluting countries may follow US as reported in <b>COP</b> <b>documents</b> but for different reasons. In 2010 in Cancun, Japan stated that it will not sign up a second Kyoto term, because it would impose restrictions on it not faced by its main economic competitors, China, India and Indonesia. A similar indication was given by the Prime Minister of New Zealand in November 2012 in Doha. At the 2012 conference in Doha, last minute objections at the conference by Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan were ignored by the governing officials, and they have indicated that they will likely withdraw or not ratify the treaty. These defections place additional pressures on the UNFCCC process. However, a positive attitude was noticed in the Paris Agreement, which was concluded in the last minute of the COP 21 Conference.|$|R

40|$|This {{deliverable}} first analyzes some integration problems encountered {{during the}} integration of the O’CoP ontology that was developed by several ontologists. Then, we describe several experiments of development of CoP-specific ontologies · Natural Language processing (NLP) tools were used by Knowledge Management (KM) service developers for analyzing a corpus of e-mails of the @pretic CoP, so as to develop a “Technical Problem” ontology. We also reused an existing hierarchy in order to build the Ontopedia ontology. Last, the development of the ontologies “Human Problems” and “Learning and Teaching” for the @pretic CoP relied on brainstormings between the CoP mediator and the CoP members. · For the Form@Hetice CoP, the ontology was aimed at being used by the BayFac system offering service of document classification, and was developed by the service developers, with a validation by the Form@Hetice CoP mediator. · For Learn-Nett CoP, the ontology was also aimed at being used by the BayFac system, and was developed by the service developers and the CoP mediator (who was {{also a member of the}} CoP), with a continuous validation by a CoP focus group. · For the TFT CoP, tbe ontology was developed manually by the CoP mediator through a folksonomy obtained using tags on the <b>CoP</b> <b>documents,</b> according to social tagging approach. At the end of the deliverable, we compare these different ontologies with related work and we analyze them from reusability viewpoin...|$|R
40|$|A {{community}} of practice (CoP) {{is defined as a}} group who share a common concern or a commitment towards a goal, and find solutions to common problems.

40|$|This mix-method study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the conception of leadership effectiveness at secondary school level in Sindh Pakistan. The Leadership Challenges, the Impact of existing System Support and Leadership Coping Approaches were thoroughly explored. The population {{of this study was}} based on 448 (both male and female from rural and urban areas) heads of secondary schools of 9 districts of Hyderabad directorate of schools. Data were collected through in-depth individual interviews, and then focus group discussions. Thus, box-oriented Sindh Leadership Challenges Survey Questionnaire [SLCSQ- 2013] and Impact of System Support and Leadership Coping Approaches Survey Questionnaire [ISSLCASQ- 2013) were developed on the basis of initially collected qualitative data. These Questionnaires were then administered to a wide randomly selected stratified sample of 90 subjects of same population to justify the qualitative data. Major findings of this study reveal that school heads are experiencing serious challenges in many areas of their administration: authority and power, district school relationship, instructional leadership practice, financial management, conduct of annual exams, staff union relationship and community relationship. They are highly challenged by bureaucratic and political forces in performing different leadership roles. They face lack of existing system support in face of such challenges. This study also revealed that heads of schools use various Leadership <b>Coping</b> Approaches: <b>documenting,</b> performing teaching role, dealing according to the professional level of the staff, adopting flexibility in authority and power and reconciliatory approach etc to deal with challenges.

The Animals Committee made species-specific recommendations at the 13 th and 14 th meetings of the Conference of the Parties for improving the conservation status of sharks and the regulation of international trade in these species. Decision 14. 107 states that the Animals Committee shall continue activities specified under Resolution Conf. 12. 6, including refinement of the list of shark species of concern, in collaboration with FAO, taking account of those referenced in Annex 3 to <b>document</b> <b>CoP</b> 14 Doc. 59. 1, and shall report on these activities at the 15 th meeting of the Conference of the Parties. While some work has been done towards the refinement of the list of shark species of concern, the United States believes that the current list is too extensive and lacks prioritization. Not all species on the list have benefited from recent evaluations of trade data or assessments of their status. Further, while the status of some species is considered poor, in some cases it has not been determined whether international trade is affecting their status.

40|$|This {{intensive}} single-site {{case study}} {{has taken the}} entering cohort of Year 11 students in the year 2000 and has used: Point-of-entry and post-experience interviews of students admitted to the course, Parallel entry and on-course surveys, On-course administration of the well-credentialed Adolescent Coping Scale (Frydenberg and Lewis, 1993), and Staff interviews to identify and describe the environmental, personal and contextual factors {{that are associated with}} a student’s completion/non-completion of the two year Course and thereby help the College Administration address the on-going unacceptably high numbers of students not completing the Course. By making extensive use of the Adolescent <b>Coping</b> Scale to <b>document</b> and analyse the coping behaviours of the sample group, the study has revealed interesting differences between the coping styles of suburban and country youth. More importantly, {{from the point of view}} of this research, it has supported Frydenberg and Lewis’ observation that when young people who cope well are compared with their peers who appear not to cope, they make relative little use of non-productive or ineffective coping behaviours. The study has developed a computer program in Microsoft Excel™ that can be used easily and routinely to produce comparative profiles of individuals or groups. The profiles may then be used to predict whether a student is at risk of not continuing into Year 12 and provides a basis for the counselling of such students. Pen pictures characteristic of a successful student and an unsuccessful student, together with the implications of the research for the College Administration and the opportunities for further research bring the study to a close...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a strong}} push in public health for multi-faceted {{partnerships}} to develop practice-relevant evidence that effectively address complex risk factors like tobacco use. Consequently, new partnership structures that cross-cut different social groups are emerging to harness their distinct knowledge and generate actionable breakthroughs. Little is known about these structures, particularly informal ones that hinge on voluntary group membership like Communities of Practice (CoPs). Specifically, {{little is known about}} the factors/processes that enable people representing different social groups to translate their knowledge across group boundaries and co-create knowledge that informs action in these informal structures. Calls to develop/test theories, frameworks, and models are made to enlighten these gaps. This study responded to these calls by developing and testing a conceptual framework. The framework asserts that a shared identity, member identification / sense of belonging, social capital and psychological safety contribute to diverse people cohering into a collective, which was deemed important to enable knowledge to translate across group boundaries. The study examined how each factor influenced and inter-related to influence the use of CoP-related knowledge and its different types (with an emphasis on conceptual and instrumental uses). The study also examined what factors contributed to or detracted from these relationships in the context of the Program Training and Consultation Centre’s tobacco control specific Learning through Evidence and Action Reflection Network (LEARN) Community of Practice (CoP) project. Following a pragmatist orientation, a two-phased quant-QUAL sequential, explanatory mixed-methods embedded case study design was employed. The LEARN CoP project formed the case study and two CoPs that comprised that project formed the embedded units. Phase I of the study involved a quantitative survey that was completed by 35 of 58 eligible LEARN CoP members. The Phase II dominant qualitative study involved ~ 90 minute audio-recorded telephone interviews of 14 LEARN CoP members (seven per embedded unit) who comprised a subset of Phase I survey respondents (nested sampling approach). <b>CoP</b> <b>documents</b> (meeting minutes, audio-recorded meetings, Community Charters and Learning Agendas, WebEx™ discussion posts) served as supplementary data sources. Phase I quantitative analyses examined whether each factor of interest predicted knowledge use using simple and multiple linear regression, tested an analytic model that proposed shared identity led to knowledge use via the mediators member identification, social capital and psychological safety using Baron & Kenny’s (1986) mediation approach and Goodman’s Test (1960) for confirmation. As a prelude to the Phase II qualitative study, descriptive statistics, t-tests and ANOVA were conducted to discern how the LEARN CoP and more specifically each of its embedded units (CoP A and CoP B) were developing with respect to the factors of interest and what differences existed between the two communities. Phase I findings loosely informed the focus of the Phase II qualitative study and data were coded and analysed using open, axial and selective coding procedures (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Phase I and Phase II data were compared and contrasted in the discussion, with greater emphasis placed on the qualitative findings. Overall findings revealed that in the LEARN CoP case, each factor in the conceptual framework influenced how members used knowledge gained in the CoP. These factors also inter-related in ways that helped diverse members to cohere in ways that influenced knowledge use. Shared identity, member identification / sense of belonging and psychological safety were related to conceptual types of knowledge use (increased awareness, learning as a result of CoP knowledge). Social capital was the only factor that was related to both conceptual and instrumental types of CoP knowledge use (e. g., knowledge gained from the CoP was used to inform decision making or applied in some fashion in practice). However, member identification / sense of belonging emerged as an important theme that motivated members to interact and build social capital which in turn led to instrumental types of knowledge use. A superordinate identity (shaped by a common and actionable purpose) helped members to jel together despite representing different social groups by serving as an anchor point for member identification / sense of belonging. The CoP’s ‘alignment’ with the philosophies, culture and priorities of important entity’s that shaped the CoP’s work (e. g., government and the organizations that members represented) also influenced the use of CoP knowledge. Other factors including relevant knowledge, leadership (including member roles), and a variety of mechanisms that enabled interaction (i. e., in-person meetings, WebEx, teleconferences, structured time for practice sharing, working groups) contributed to or detracted from the relationships found in the study. Solving complex problems like tobacco-related chronic diseases necessitates building multi-faceted partnership structures that connect different configurations of an existing or desired system and their respective knowledge. This is not an easy task because it requires bringing together people representing potentially different social identities that possess their own ways of thinking and doing, which can limit knowledge use. This study sought to understand how factors that help diverse people to cohere into a collective enhance knowledge use. The study highlights the need to understand identity-based issues at play when people from different social groups are brought together in partnership structures like the formally instituted, voluntary CoP examined. Cultivating a shared identity and sense of belonging can bridge silos and motivate people to engage in behaviours that build rich pools of social capital. These factors together can enhance the co-creation and use of evidence and collective action that can save lives...|$|R
