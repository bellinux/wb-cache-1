2500|$|During the 1920s, {{there was}} a {{dramatic}} upsurge in demand by local governments and road districts for gravel, sand, and cement. [...] Outdoor construction materials were in high demand to build concrete-paved roads and highways for motor cars. This demand created {{a new lease on}} life for the old Andaste.

[...] The Company's dock and <b>concrete</b> <b>plant,</b> on the Calumet River in South Chicago, always needed more aggregate. [...] In addition, the Company had been hired as a contractor to the City of Chicago, which was building a broad parkway along its shoreline that required hundreds of thousands of tons of landfill sand. [...] The parkway that the Andaste was helping to build would become Chicago's Lake Shore Drive. [...] Although the Andaste was itself owned by Cleveland interests, the vessel rarely left the sand-and-gravel-rich basin of Lake Michigan.|$|E
