5|$|The areas {{shown as}} Australia's and New Zealand's <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> British {{territory}} {{until they were}} handed over following the countries' independence. Australia currently claims the largest area. The claims of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France and Norway are all recognised by each other.|$|E

5000|$|Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, [...] FAA {{requires}} that parallel {{state and federal}} <b>claims</b> <b>be</b> bifurcated when federal <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> non-arbitrable but state <b>claims</b> <b>are.</b>|$|R
50|$|Not {{all these}} defences are {{available}} to all restitutionary claims. The availability of a defence may turn on: whether a restitutionary <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> legal or equitable; whether a <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> for a personal or proprietary remedy; and whether the <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> brought under national or EU law.|$|R
2500|$|In Chapters 7, 12, and 13, {{creditors}} must file a [...] "proof of claim" [...] to get paid. In a Chapter 11 case, a creditor is {{not required}} to file a proof of <b>claim</b> (that <b>is,</b> a proof of <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> [...] "deemed filed") if the creditor's <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> listed on the debtor's bankruptcy schedules, unless the <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> scheduled as [...] "disputed, contingent, or unliquidated."

5|$|A {{total of}} 2,700 <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> filed by residents, {{businesses}} and insurers. A group of 146 claimants {{were hoping to}} bring a class action against Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd. On 17 March 2006 a High Court official, Senior Master Turner, adjourned a hearing on whether to permit the class action until October 2006. Claimants including insurance companies, small businesses and about 280families whose properties were damaged or destroyed were claiming up to £1billion in damages.|$|E
5|$|Among Alaska Natives, the Rampart Dam project {{encouraged}} {{organization and}} the creation of communications links between various like-minded communities and tribal groups. When the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was proposed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Native organizations that had formed to oppose Rampart Dam were revived in opposition to the pipeline. Only after Native land <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> recognized in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act did the pipeline progress.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1870, chemists {{thought that there}} should be an alkali metal beyond caesium, with an atomic number of 87. It was then {{referred}} to by the provisional name eka-caesium. Research teams attempted to locate and isolate this missing element, and at least four false <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> made that the element had been found before an authentic discovery was made.|$|E
40|$|Until recently, obstetric <b>claims</b> (which <b>are</b> {{invariably}} high-value) {{used to be}} {{clustered around}} problems related to labour. However, a second group of high-value <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> emerging: those related to missed abnormaltities. The value of <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> now so high that a single individual is unable to compensate a claimant adequately, and indemnity is therefore essential. Although such <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> relatively rare, indemnity costs are high as the <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> large. The high value of obstetric claims, including those for missed abnormalities, {{is reflected in the}} cost of indemnity for obstetricians and those performing antenatal ultrasound...|$|R

25|$|However, Nayachandra's <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> not {{supported}} by any other literary or epigraphic evidence. Therefore, the historical accuracy of this <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> doubtful.|$|R
5|$|As the {{relations}} between the West and the Soviet Union deteriorated with the US and the UK backing Turkey, Soviet <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> out of the agenda by 1947. However, it was not until 1953, after Stalin's death, that they officially abandoned their claims, thus ending the dispute.|$|E
5|$|At {{his death}} he had {{achieved}} 57 aerial victories, placing him seventh {{on the list}} of the war's most successful aces. Just under two-thirds of his victims can be identified by name. This is possible since, unlike other Allied aces, a substantial proportion of McCudden's <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> made over Allied-held territory. The majority of his successes were achieved with 56 Squadron RFC and all but five fell while flying the S.E.5a.|$|E
5|$|Before {{settlers}} arrived, {{the land}} that became known as Forest Park was covered by a Douglas-fir forest. By 1851, its acreage had been divided into donation land claims filed by settlers with plans to clear the forest and build upon the property. After logging, the steep slopes and unstable silt loosened by heavy rains caused landslides that defeated construction plans, and <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> defaulted or donated to the city.|$|E
40|$|The {{communicative}} action {{theory of}} Habermas {{has been discussed}} and used within the research community of Language Action Perspective. The concept of validity <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> {{considered to be an}} important contribution. In his theory, Habermas has formulated three validity <b>claims</b> to <b>be</b> universal in communication: The claims for truth, rightness and truthfulness. A theoretical inquiry into the validity claim concept and the three validity <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> performed in the paper. A critical analysis is pursued based on communication examples from Habermas. The concept of universal validity <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> transformed to general communication claims. The truth <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> rejected as universal. Besides the claims emanating from Habermas several other general communication <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> formulated: Descriptive correctness, addressee relevance, respectfulness, deliberation, dialogical adequacy and argumentativeness. ...|$|R
50|$|Pyrrhonian moral {{skepticism}} {{holds that}} the reason we are unjustified in believing any moral <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> that it is irrational for us to believe either that any moral <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> true or that any moral <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> false. Thus, {{in addition to being}} agnostic on whether (i) is true, Pyrrhonian moral skepticism denies (ii).|$|R

5|$|During 1944–45, the Luftwaffe {{committed}} {{two other}} jet- or rocket-powered fighters to combat operations. In {{addition to the}} Me 262, the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet and the Heinkel He 162 Volksjäger both become operational. Few <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> made by pilots of the Me 163 and He 162, and none achieved ace status on either of these types.|$|E
5|$|Following a minor injury, Wurmheller {{was again}} posted to the fighter pilot school in Werneuchen as an instructor. Upon {{his return to}} front line duty in May 1942, he was posted to 1. Staffel and claimed 10 {{victories}} during May 1942 and a further 12 victories the following month. Among these <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> four Spitfires shot down on 31 May and five on 5 June 1942. Most of these missions were flown with Rudolf Pflanz as his wingman.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, {{work on the}} Princes Street section stopped due to {{contractual}} disagreements between TIE and BSC {{after the}} latter submitted a request for an additional £80 million of funding. Edinburgh Council believed the contractors' <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> unjustified as they had agreed to fixed-price contracts. After negotiations, BSC agreed to commence construction in March 2009 within the original budget, although disagreements remained. Work restarted and line construction went ahead.|$|E
50|$|<b>Claims</b> <b>are</b> {{made that}} MISS has better {{outcomes}} than open surgery {{with respect to}} fewer complications and shorter hospital stays, but data supporting those <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> weak.|$|R
50|$|The Privy Council {{ruled that}} B had no arguable claim. However, the daughters <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> still arguable, and their <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> remitted {{back to the}} court for arguing.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, Noncognitivism {{holds that}} we can never know that any moral <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> true because moral <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> {{incapable}} of being true or false (they are not truth-apt). Instead, moral <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> imperatives (e.g. [...] "Don't steal babies!"), expressions of emotion (e.g. [...] "stealing babies: Boo!"), or expressions of [...] "pro-attitudes" [...] ("I {{do not believe that}} babies should be stolen.") ...|$|R
5|$|In all, about 15,000 damage <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> filed across Réunion, with a {{total of}} 3,251 homes damaged and about 850 {{condemned}} or destroyed. Property damage from the storm amounted to €95 million (US$83.4 million). Collectively, losses on the island were estimated at €200 million (US$190 million). Although there were no fatalities directly related to the storm, six people died in various events indirectly caused by Dina.|$|E
5|$|Much {{confusion}} {{has arisen}} over what proponents of punctuated equilibrium actually argued, what mechanisms they advocated, {{how fast the}} punctuations were, what taxonomic scale their theory applied to, how revolutionary their <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> intended to be, and how punctuated equilibrium related to other ideas like quantum evolution, saltationism, and mass extinction.|$|E
5|$|On 20 December, the LTTE {{mounted a}} counter-offensive as SLA forces were {{preparing}} an assault {{to capture the}} village of Iranamadu, located {{to the south of}} Kilinochchi. The LTTE claimed that at least 60 soldiers were killed in the battle, but these <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> again disputed by the military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara, who claimed that SLA losses were 12 killed and 12 missing.|$|E
50|$|The Southern Ocean: Australia claims an {{exclusive}} economic zone (EEZ) around its Antarctic territorial claim. Since this <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> only recognised by four other countries, the EEZ <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> also disputed.|$|R
2500|$|In June 1979, the Montana Supreme Court {{ordered that}} all water rights <b>claims</b> <b>be</b> filed by April 30, 1982. This {{resulted}} in roughly 219,000 water rights claims in 85 sub-basins {{in the state}} of Montana. The legislature enacted a law in 1995 allowing approximately 4,500 additional <b>claims</b> to <b>be</b> filed, although these <b>claims</b> may <b>be</b> considered only after [...] "on time" [...] water <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> adjudicated.|$|R
5000|$|Because the <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> not {{directed}} to an abstract idea under step {{one of the}} Alice analysis, {{we do not need}} to proceed to step two of that analysis[...] [...] [...] We think it is clear for the reasons stated that the <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> {{not directed}} to an abstract idea, and so we stop at step one. We conclude that the <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> patent-eligible.|$|R
5|$|The act plainly has no application. The Indians here {{concerned}} do {{not belong}} to any of the classes described therein and their <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> in no way derived from the Spanish or Mexican governments. Moreover, it does not appear that these Indians were occupying the lands in question when the act was passed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> {{a massive}} exaggeration. But while the Big Wing had proven {{physically}} ineffective {{for the most}} part, its biggest contribution to the day had been its use as a psychological weapon. The German bomber units that had seen the Big Wing form up were quite shocked, and those crews in the badly hit units, including KG 2 and KG 3, that had witnessed head-on collisions with German aircraft were badly shaken.|$|E
5|$|This {{inequality}} further offended {{the smaller}} countries. Finally, this inequality {{also meant that}} the minority rights were not seen as a universal right; it was exclusively a foreign policy issue, and thus populations that had no state to back up their <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> relatively disadvantaged when compared to ones backed up by a powerful state or group of interests.|$|E
