40|$|Demand of subsidized LPG 3 -kgs in Indonesia {{has been}} {{increasing}} since the Indonesian government imposed a conversion program from kerosene to Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) in 2007. The high increase in demand for subsidized LPG 3 -kgs led to the scarcity of products availability.

In this research, the development model of the integration of closed loop supply chain network and vehicle routing problem with simultaneous deliveries and pick-ups with time windows has been proposed.

After filling station inspected and filled the LPG tubes, distributors delivered LPG 3 -kgs subsidized from the filling station to some retailers.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model of {{integrated}} supply chain network for allocating subsidized Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) in a <b>closed</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system.</b> Subsidized LPG is selected as case study due to its specific product in Indonesia. Since 2007, the Indonesian government makes policy, namely energy conversion from kerosene to LPG. The main purpose of converting kerosene to LPG is to reduce subsidies on fuel oil. The <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> consists of several of filling stations, distributors and retailers. Curently, the distribution of subsidized LPG, does not flow smoothly, {{there will be a}} shortage or excess tubes in retailers mainly because it uses a <b>closed</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system.</b> A <b>closed</b> <b>distribution</b> means that people who are eligible to buy subsidized LPG will be given cards identifying that they are legal receivers of the LPG. The developed model has been able to establish the allocation of filling stations that will supply a particular distributor. The model has also been able to establish which distributor that will supply a particular retailer. Based on the developed model, and by using a numerical example as a case study, it can be determined the allocation of LPG from filling station to the distributor and from the distributor to the retailer with minimum distribution costs. LPG in some specific retailers is supplied by only one distributor which is authorized to distribute subsidized LPG on the retailers. However, this model has limitations to arrange the route filling and distribution route...|$|R

30|$|Injections of DER {{jeopardize}} the existing protection coordination schemes for the <b>distribution</b> <b>system.</b> Impact depends upon number, size, type {{and location of}} DER in the <b>distribution</b> <b>system.</b> Moreover, as the location of DER in <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> varies, the configuration of <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> also changes. Generally, the <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> are radial in nature and over current based protection schemes are set for unidirectional flow of fault currents. Penetration of DER usually causes meshed configuration of <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> and on majority of distribution feeders, fault current flows in both the directions [4]. The protection schemes which are designed for unidirectional flow of fault currents fails to provide the adequate protection coordination when DER power is injected in the <b>distribution</b> <b>systems.</b> Moreover, there is a requirement of additional number of direction over current relays. The new settings of over current relays depend upon the location of new incoming DER in the <b>distribution</b> <b>systems.</b> In addition to these requirements, the impact may also reach to upstream transmission lines connected with downstream DER connected <b>distribution</b> <b>systems.</b> Under such operational conditions, the distance relays installed on the transmission line may result in underreact operation [8].|$|R

A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a law on privatization was adopted in 1997, as well as a program on state property privatization. The government has made major strides toward joining the World Trade Organization. By 1994, however, the Armenian government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-2005. Armenia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2003. Armenia also has managed to slash inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. Armenia's unemployment rate, however, remains high, despite strong economic growth. The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in the early and mid-1990s have been offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor. Armenia is now a net energy exporter, although it does not have sufficient generating capacity to replace Metsamor, which is under international pressure to <b>close.</b> The electricity <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> was privatized in 2002. Armenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid, remittances from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct investment.
