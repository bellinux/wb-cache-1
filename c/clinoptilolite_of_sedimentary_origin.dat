40|$|The {{additive}} <b>clinoptilolite</b> <b>of</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>origin</b> contains {{at least}} 80 % clinoptilolite (hydrated calcium aluminosilicate) {{and a maximum}} of 20 % clay minerals. Regarding the limited database and partly controversial findings, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that 10 000 mg clinoptilolite/kg complete feed could {{be considered to be}} safe for all animal species. Clinoptilolite is essentially not absorbed and is excreted with the faeces. There is no evidence that clinoptilolite will be degraded during its passage through the gastrointestinal tract of target animals. The consumer is therefore not exposed to clinoptilolite {{as a result of its}} use in animal nutrition; consequently, no risk for the consumer will arise. With regard to the high dusting potential of the additive, and in the absence of data on its irritation and sensitisation potential, the FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat the additive as an irritant to the skin and eyes, a dermal sensitiser and an inhalation toxicant. The use of clinoptilolite in animal nutrition does not pose a risk for the environment. Based on data on a large variety of compound feeds, the additive is considered to have the potential to be effective as an anticaking agent. No data were available to allow conclusions to be drawn on its efficacy as a pellet binder. However, as the physical properties required for an anticaking and a pellet-binding additive are similar, and the efficacy of clinoptilolite as an anticaking agent is proven, the FEEDAP Panel considers it likely that the additive also has the potential to be effective as a pellet binder...|$|E

40|$|We report here new sulfur isotope {{analyses}} {{from the}} Betze-Post-Screamer deposit, the largest Carlin-type gold deposit in the world. Carlin-type deposits contain {{high concentrations of}} arsenic, antimony, mercury, tellurium and other elements of environmental interest, and are surrounded by large volumes of crust in which these elements are also enriched. Uncertainty about the source of sulfur and metals in and around Carlin-type deposits has hampered formulation of models for their origin, which are needed for improved mineral exploration and environmental assessment. Previous studies have concluded that most Carlin-type deposits formed from sulfide sulfur that is largely <b>of</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>origin.</b> Most <b>of</b> these studies are based on analyses of mineral separates consisting of pre-ore diagenetic pyrite with thin overgrowths of ore-related arsenian pyrite rather than pure, ore-related pyrite. Our SIMS spot analyses of ore-related pyrite overgrowths in the Screamer zone of the Betze-Post-Screamer deposit yield δ 34 S values of about − 1 to 4 ‰ with one value of about 7 ‰. Conventional analyses of realgar and orpiment separates from throughout the deposit yield δ 34 S values of about 5 – 7 ‰ with one value of 10 ‰ in the Screamer zone. These results, along with results from an earlier SIMS study in the Post zone of the deposit and phase equilibrium constraints, indicate that early arsenian pyrite were formed from fluids of magmatic origin with variable contamination from sulfur in Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. Later arsenic sulfides were formed from solutions to which sulfur <b>of</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>origin</b> had been added. The presence <b>of</b> Paleozoic <b>sedimentary</b> sulfur in Carlin-type deposits does not require direct involvement of hydrothermal solutions <b>of</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>origin.</b> Instead, {{it could have been}} added by magmatic assimilation <b>of</b> Paleozoic <b>sedimentary</b> rocks or by hydrothermal leaching of sulfur from wall rocks to the deposit. Thus, the dominant process delivering sulfur, arsenic, gold and mineralizing fluids to Carlin-type systems and their surrounding country rocks was probably separation of fluids from a magmatic source...|$|R
