40|$|Phytophthora medicaginis is an {{important}} soil-borne oomycete pathogen of lucerne (Medicago sativa) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum) within Australia and overseas. To understand the host/pathogen interaction, a pathosystem was developed using the model legume Medicago truncatula. Using the resources developed for genetics and molecular characterisation in this model plant, {{the aim of this}} research was to understand the interaction between M. truncatula and P. medicaginis, with a view to improving resistance to this important pathogen in related legumes. To observe and characterise the interaction between M. truncatula and P. medicaginis, a pathosystem was developed by first screening a germplasm collection of 99 M. truncatula accessions. This revealed a continuous distribution in disease phenotypes with variable extremes in natural resistance to P. medicaginis culture UQ 5750, isolated originally from M. sativa. P. medicaginis zoospore inoculation of 1 - 2 week-old seedlings in glasshouse experiments proved to be a robust and repeatable method to consistently confirm the responses observed for six key M. truncatula accessions; SA 8618 and SA 8623 exhibit high natural resistance to this pathogen, accession A 17 is moderately resistant, A 20 is moderately susceptible and accessions Borung and SA 30199 are susceptible. To characterise the genetic basis of resistance to P. medicaginis, two reciprocal F 2 populations from <b>cross</b> <b>pollinations</b> between A 17 and Borung and SA 8618 and SA 30199 were produced and then phenotyped for disease symptoms. Genetic segregation patterns indicated the involvement of a gene with a major effect in both reciprocal populations. In particular, a 3 : 1 segregation ratio for resistance in the F 2 populations from <b>cross</b> <b>pollinations</b> between A 17 and Borung indicated the possibility of a single dominant gene for moderate resistance. Further phenotyping of F 3 families is required to verify this. A M. truncatula linkage map was constructed using 50 F 2 individuals of the A 17 X Borung population and 49 F 2 individuals from the Borung X A 17 population. The map, covering 519. 3 cM, is comprised of 84 SSR markers with an average distance between markers of 8. 7 cM. These are evenly spaced over 7 linkage groups, including a super linkage group conferred by a translocation event between LG 4 and LG 8 of accession A 17. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis confirmed there was a QTL with a major effect in the A 17 /Borung reciprocal populations. A significant QTL was determined by quantifying two symptoms of P. medicaginis infection - proportion of dead/chlorotic leaves and root fresh weight. The trait loci for both symptoms were located on the same linkage group within the same region, supporting the putative position of the QTL and the authenticity of its involvement in resistance to P. medicaginis.

We found no fruit set of B. ambrosia during long-term monitoring of species diversity, reproductive phenology and pollinators of local orchid species in Green Stone Forest Park. Our {{objective was to}} determine barriers to fruit set in B. ambrosia. Methods Flowering phenology and natural fruit-set were monitored {{once a week for}} three years. Floral morphology was studied during flowering time. We also investigated the rate of pollinia removal and deposition over two flowering seasons. To determine the self- compatibility system, different hand-pollination treatments were conducted over three years at the study site. We also observed floral visitors for 150 h over two years. Important findings Unlike other myophilous species in the genus, B. ambrosia is fragrant and presents nectar as reward. Observations of floral visitors showed that honeybee (Apis cerana cerana) was the only efficient pollinator and regularly visited flowers with high frequency. In natural populations, the rates of pollinia removal anddeposition were high, but there was no fruit set. The hinged labellum {{plays an important role in}} the process of honeybee pollination of B. ambrosia. No fruit was found in the selfing pollination treatment, and fruit set of <b>crossing</b> <b>pollination</b> treatments was > 90 % over two years, suggesting that B. ambrosia is self-incompatible. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a self-incompatible species in Bulbophyllum. Individuals of B. ambrosia have a mass of flowers opening simultaneously during anthesis because of its strong ability in cloning. Honeybees visited 4. 29 ± 0. 40 flowers (n = 66) in average per visitation, which may lead to geitonogamy. Self-incompatibility causes no fruit set as the result of geitonogamy.

25|$|Philodendrons exhibit {{extremely}} few physical reproductive {{barriers to}} prevent hybridization, {{but very few}} natural hybrids are found in nature.

The beetles have also been observed to be selective to the height of the plant they pollinate, which would serve as an additional preventive measure to make hybrids less likely. Because of these outside barriers, philodendrons may not have had to evolve physical mechanisms to prevent cross-pollination. Hybrids in nature are only rarely reported.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the flowering process the only part that is visible is the fused cap of petals known as the calyptra. Shortly after the calyptra is shed, liberating the pollen from the anthers of the stamen. Wind and insects generally play only a small role in aiding pollination, with the process being mostly self-contained within the vine. But cross-pollination between vine species is possible as in the cases of the origins of several grape varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon (a <b>cross</b> <b>pollination</b> of Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon blanc) and Petite Sirah (a cross of Syrah and Peloursin). During the process of fertilization, the pollen fertilizes the ovary which produces seeds as the flower begins the transformation into a grape berry, encapsulating the seed. Detrimental weather (cold, wind & rain) can severely affect the flowering process, causing many flowers not to be fertilized and produce a group. It is during this time when the buds that will become next years crops begin to form.|$|E

Mallakhamb is the name given to a little known style of physical culture practiced in India. Mallakhamb developed {{in the state of}} Maharashtra in India and the first reference to it is in the Manasollasa (1135 AD), a detailed instruction manual on the scholarship and military training of young Chalukyan princes written by the Chalukyan King Somesvara III. Mallakhamb was originally practiced to develop the strength, agility and flexibility of wrestlers and has now developed into a national sport with championships held annually at district, state and national levels throughout India. Mallakhamb involves an unusual mix of wrestling strength training and yoga postures practiced on apparati including a wooden pole and a cotton rope.

40|$|The present {{authors have}} long {{engaged in the}} studies on auto-triploid plants {{with the purpose of}} {{establishing}} the primary trisomic set in rice. It is well-known that triploids produce the primary trisomics in their progenies of selfing or crossing with diploids. With above purpose, cytological observations on the triploids were attempted and self and reciprocal <b>cross</b> <b>pollinations</b> between the triploids and diploids were made. And further, the observations on development of hybrid seeds were conducted. The results were reported in this paper. The auto-triploid plants used in these studies were produced previously from the crossing between auto-tetraploid and its original diploid plants, introducing the embryo-culture technique. 1) Cytological observation on auto-triploid plants At first metaphase 5 to 12 trivalents and 0 to 7 univalents per cell were found. On the average, its meiotic configuration was 10. 38 III + 1. 58 II + 1. 67 I in first metaphase and 11. 09 III + 0. 89 II + 0. 97 I in diakinesis. In some configurations univalents were more formed than trivalents, that was the cases of 11 III + 3 I, 10 III + 1 II + 4 I, 9 III + 2 II + 5 I and 8 III + 3 II + 6 I in first metaphase, and 11 III + 3 I and 10 III + 1 II + 4 I in diakinesis. These configurations showed that a set of three homologous chromosomes did not pare with each other, but formed three univalents separately. The frequencies of above configurations were 2. 6 ％ in first metaphase and 2. 8 % in diakinesis on the average. In subsequent meiosis, several lagging chromosomes were found. They varied from 0 to 6 per cell at first anaphase and 0 to 4 at second anaphase. Average was calculated at 0. 63 per cell in first anaphase and 0. 18 in second anaphase. 2) Crossing results and seed development When triploids were selfed or crossed by pollen grains of diploid plant, many imperfect seeds which developed very poorly and contained no endosperm were obtained. They were formed at the rate of about 20 % to pollinated flowers in both of the self and <b>cross</b> <b>pollinations.</b> Their weights and germinating abilities were very light and low, but rather higher in cross pollinated seeds showing 4. 0 mg and 2. 5 % of weight and germinating rate respectively than selfed ones which could not germinate and were 1. 3 mg of weight. Besides the imperfect seeds, a small amount of perfect seeds was formed. They were plump and well-developed externally and well-germinated. The seed setting ratio in <b>cross</b> and self <b>pollinations</b> was 3. 6 and 0. 4 % respectively. When diploids were pollinated by pollen grains of triploid plant, seed fertility was very low, that was 0. 7 % of imperfect seeds and 1. 6 ％ of perfect seeds. In order to make clear the development of F 1 seeds, imperfect seeds of 3 X× 2 X and 3 X selfing and perfect seeds of 3 X× 2 X were fixed separately at the matured stage that was about 30 days after pollination, and provided for embryological observation. Embryos of 3 X× 2 X were as large as normal embryo of control, and almost all of the embryos differentiated 3 rd foliage leaf as control. But some irreguralities were found, i. e. 18 embryos ovserved lacked the 3 rd foliage leaf and radicle, and shape of all embryos ovserved was more or less irregular. Embryos of imperfect seeds of 3 X× 2 X were rather larger than normal embryo, but differentiation was rather retarded. The third foliage leaf had differentiated only in 15. 8 % of the materials used and in 21. 1 % stopped the growth before differentiation stage. Another embryos stopped the growth at 2 nd or 1 st foliage leaf stage. Abnormality was also observed in the shape as mass-formation, that was lacking in inner organs, irregular angle between radicle and plumule and irregular direction in the ovule. 1) イネにおける 3 倍体の細胞学的観察および, 3 倍体自殖と 3 倍体および 2 倍体間の相反交配による種子形成について観察し,以下の知見をえた. 2) 3 倍体の減数分裂時における対合様式は移動期で 11. 09 III + 0. 89 II + 0. 97 I,および中期では 10. 38 III + 1. 59 II + 1. 67 Iであつた. また第 1 分裂後期では 0 ～ 6,第 2 分裂後期では 0 ～ 4 の遅滞染色体が観察された. 3) 3 倍体自殖および 2 倍体との交配では小数の完全種子と,多数の不完全種子とを着生したが,着生率は 3 倍体(♀) × 2 倍体(♂) がもつとも高かつた. 3 倍体自殖と 2 倍体(♀) × 3 倍体(♂) とでは,不完全種子は前者が多く着生したが完全種子は後者が多かつた. 4) 着生種子の発達程度を観察した結果,完全種子はほぼ正常な発達をとげていたが,不完全種子は種々の程度の発育異常を伴ない,また胚乳は消失していた. 3 倍体× 2 倍体の不完全種子の胚は分化期に入つていたが, 3 倍体自殖の不完全種子の胚は分化前に発育を停止していた...|$|R

The species occur sympatrically, often only a few meters apart, and conspecifics frequently occur in clumps. The majority of the species flowered {{during the dry season}} (May to August) except D. oblongue, D. villosue and K. speciosa which flowered during the wet season (December to March). Most of them flowered for several months except Tabebuia (one month). The most frequent flowering pattern was the "Cornucopian"' type, except for D. crulsianue and D. Villosus which were "Steady-State" types. Most congeners flowered synchronously, except K. speciosa which showed displacement. Flowers of all species are pollen donors (Tabebuia and Erythroxylum also have nectar rewards), but each genus presents specific floral strategies; Tabebuia, Massflowering, Erythroxylum, distyly and cauliflory, Diplueodon, enantiostyly and Kielmeyera, andromonoecy. Flowers were visited by a large spectrum of bees (38 spp.) and Erythroxylum were also visited by wasps (16 app.). However, each genus had particular pollen vectors. Tabebuia; Centris and Bombus; Erythroxylum: wasps; Diplueodon; Apia and Trigona; and Kielmeyera; Xylocopa, despite the fact that other bees occur all year round. Controlled pollination experiments (self-, intraspecific-, interspecific crosses, tests for apomixis and from untreated bagged flowers), revealed that all species have a high outcrossing level and are selfincompatible. Only E. campeatre (shrub), D. crulsianus and D. villosus (hemixyles), showed some self-compatibility. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that pollen tubes from selfing and from interspecific <b>cross</b> <b>pollinations</b> were blocked in the ovary, suggesting that the selfincompatibility barrier operates late.

Fruit-set number from hand-pollinations and from natural pollination were low, but the former frequently yielded a higher number of fruits than the latter. Low fruit-set was associated with lack of resources allocated by the maternal parent for fruit maturation. In addition, it seemed that, in all species, many flowers were programmed to be pollen donors only, since they dropped without any sign of ovary enlargement even if they were hand-pollinated or were frequently visited by pollinators...|$|R

Therefore, manual <b>pollination</b> <b>cross</b> were held in 2010, between plants of H. undatus x H. polyrhizus and H. undatus x H. setaceus. Aiming evaluate the genetic diversity of the progenies for future use in breeding program, based on cladodes characteristics, six characters were assessed: length and diameter of stem, distance between areoles, arch height, number and size of spines/areole. From the Euclidean distance matrix analysis was constructed a dendrogram by the UPGMA method. There was great variability among hybrids, and eight of them have shown promise for use in breeding program...|$|R
2500|$|Companies {{that produce}} Bt seed are {{introducing}} strains with multiple Bt proteins. Monsanto did this with Bt cotton in India, where {{the product was}} rapidly adopted. Monsanto has also; {{in an attempt to}} simplify the process of implementing refuges in fields to comply with Insect Resistance Management(IRM) policies and prevent irresponsible planting practices; begun marketing seed bags with a set proportion of refuge (non-transgenic) seeds mixed in with the Bt seeds being sold. Coined [...] "Refuge-In-a-Bag" [...] (RIB), this practice is intended to increase farmer compliance with refuge requirements and reduce additional labor needed at planting from having separate Bt and refuge seed bags on hand. This strategy is likely to reduce the likelihood of Bt-resistance occurring for corn rootworm, but may increase the risk of resistance for lepidopteran corn pests, such as European corn borer. Increased concerns for resistance with seed mixtures include partially resistant larvae on a Bt plant being able to move to a susceptible plant to survive or <b>cross</b> <b>pollination</b> of refuge pollen on to Bt plants that can lower the amount of Bt expressed in kernels for ear feeding insects.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the pollen viability of the commonly cultivated varieties of Capsicum species and assessed the potentials for gene exchange among the genotypes through hybridization studies. Capsicum annuum var. abbreviatum, C. annuum var. acuminatum, C. annuum var. grossum and C. frutescens var. baccatum were the species and varieties used in this study. The present findings indicated {{that the percentage of}} pollen viability varied in the studied Capsicum genotypes. The highest pollen viability was obtained in C. annuum var. abbreviatum (96. 3 %), followed by C. annuum var. grossum (95 %), and C. annuum var. acuminatum (91. 1 %). The lowest pollen viability was recorded in C. frutescens var. baccatum (86. 2 %). The pollen viability was high in most varieties indicating that meiosis is normal, resulting in viable pollen grains. Several intraspecific and interspecific crosses were performed among the Capsicum genotypes and three putative hybrid fruits were produced. Percentage successes obtained in the crosses were low and comparable in both intra and inter-specific crosses. In the entire <b>crosses</b> pattern, <b>pollination</b> success of 10 % was recorded for C. frutescens var. baccatum and C. annuum var. acuminatum. Knowing the nature and viability of pollen grains may help in predicting the success rate of hybridization and the successful crosses between C. frutescens var. baccatum and C. annuum var. acuminatum suggest that these two varieties are the closest genetically...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the reproductive biology of four Eucalyptus species of the subgenus Symphyomyrtus; E. spathulata, E. cladocalyx and E. leptophylla of the section Bisectaria, and E. Ieucoxylon of the section Adnataria. Aspects of the breeding system, floral morphology and pistil cytology were studied in three trees each of E. spathulata, E. cladocalyx and E. leptophylla. E. spathulata and E. Ieptophylla {{were found to be}} highly self incompatible, setting very low levels of seed from controlled self pollination. E. cladocalyx trees ranged from self compatible to self incompatible. Reductions were seen in both the number of capsules and the numbers of seed per capsule, from self pollination. The mechanism of self incompatibility was investigated in the pistil by following the success of <b>cross</b> and self <b>pollinations</b> with fluorescence microscopy. ln E. cladocalyx and E. leptophylla no reduction in ovule penetration was seen from self pollination while in E. spathulata a significant reduction was seen in two trees but not the third, indicating post-zygotic mechanisms of self incompatibility operating in all three species, with some pre-zygotic control in E. spathulata. Floral architecture differed between the three species {{in the structure of the}} inflorescence units, flower morphology, and anther, pollen and ovule numbers per flower. Pistil cytology was similar for all three species but there were differences in the length of the stylar canal, the degree of sclerotinisation of the style, stigma morphology and volume of transmitting tissue. The breeding system of E. leucoxylon was investigated with emphasis on the unusual features of gynodioecy and secondary pollen presentation. Fifty seven percent of trees in the study population were found to be male sterile, with pollen grains aborted during development between tetrad formation and anthesis. Hermaphrodite trees presented 93 percent of pollen grains on the upper style and stigma, with only seven percent of pollen grains remaining on the anthers. In the absence of pollinators hermaphrodite trees set low levels of autogamous seed compared with open pollinated pistils. Counts of pollen tubes in open pollinated pistils of each morph revealed that female trees were pollen limited in the study population. Multilocus estimates of outcrossing rates were determined for female isozyme electrophoresis. Female trees showed values of (t) approaching 1. 0, indicating complete outcrossing, while hermaphrodite trees showed significant levels of selfed seed in open pollinated seed crops, but still maintained an outcrossing rate higher than that reported for most eucalypts. The pollen-pistil interaction was investigated in three intraspecific, 57 interspecific and six intergeneric crosses using the three species Eucalyptus spathulato, E. cladoclayx and E. leptophylla as female parents. Interspecific prefertilisation isolation was found to occur in the pistil and manifested as a number of pollen tube abnormalities in the style and ovary associated with a lowered probability of ovule penetration. The major selection points in the pistil were the upper style and the ovary. The severity of abnormalities and the probability of pollen tube arrest in the pistil was proportional to the taxonomic distance between parent species. Ovule penetrations were seen mainly in crosses within the section Bisectaria or between the sections Bisectaria and Adnataria. Pollen storage, style length and mean maximum temperature during the flowering period of the male parent had no significant effect on pollen tube growth in the crosses used. Intra and interspecific combinations which showed ovule penetration were repeated the following flowering season and monitored for seed set. Most combinations produced capsules although only combinations within the section Bisectaria and between the sections Bisectaria and Adnataria set viable seed. There was considerable variation between years in cross compatibility with some female trees which showed no ovule penetration in the first year setting viable seed in the same combinations the following year. Many close combinations set levels of seed approaching intraspecific <b>cross</b> <b>pollinations,</b> while interspecific <b>crosses</b> outperformed intraspecific self pollinations in both capsule set and the number of seeds per capsule. Some crosses between the sections Bisectaria and Adnataria showed hybrid breakdown at the early seedling stage. Hybrid parentage was confirmed through intermediate seedling morphology. The findings of this study have implications for the ecology and conservation of Eucalyptus species, for breeding strategies in tree improvement programmes and for the taxonomic relationships of the species.
