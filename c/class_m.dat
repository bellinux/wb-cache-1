5|$|Ptolemy of Alexandria mapped {{the stars}} in BooksVII and VIII of his Almagest, in which he used Sirius as the {{location}} for the globe's central meridian. He depicted {{it as one of}} six red-coloured stars (see the Colour controversy section below). The other five are <b>class</b> <b>M</b> and K stars, such as Arcturus and Betelgeuse.|$|E
25|$|Although most <b>class</b> <b>M</b> {{stars are}} red dwarfs, most giants and some supergiants such as VY Canis Majoris, Antares and Betelgeuse are also <b>class</b> <b>M.</b> Furthermore, the hotter brown dwarfs are late <b>class</b> <b>M.</b> This is {{usually in the}} range of M6.5 to M9.5. The {{spectrum}} of a <b>class</b> <b>M</b> star contains lines from oxide molecules, especially TiO, in the visible and all neutral metals, but absorption lines of hydrogen are usually absent. TiO bands can be strong in <b>class</b> <b>M</b> stars, usually dominating their visible spectrum by about M5. Vanadium(II) oxide bands become present by late M.|$|E
25|$|<b>Class</b> <b>M</b> {{stars are}} by far the most common. About 76% of the main-sequence stars in the solar {{neighborhood}} are <b>class</b> <b>M</b> stars. However, <b>class</b> <b>M</b> main-sequence stars (red dwarfs) have such low luminosities that none are bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye, unless under exceptional conditions. The brightest known M-class main-sequence star is M0V Lacaille 8760, with magnitude 6.6 (the limiting magnitude for typical naked-eye visibility under good conditions is typically quoted as 6.5), and it is extremely unlikely that any brighter examples will be found.|$|E

500|$|The {{kinematics}} of Betelgeuse are complex. The age of <b>Class</b> <b>M</b> supergiants with {{an initial}} mass of [...] is roughly 10 million years. Starting from its present position and motion a projection back in time would place Betelgeuse around 290parsecs farther from the galactic plane—an implausible location, {{as there is no}} star formation region there. Moreover, Betelgeuse's projected pathway does not appear to intersect with the 25 Ori subassociation or the far younger Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC, also known as Ori OB1d), particularly since Very Long Baseline Array astrometry yields a distance from Betelgeuse to the ONC of between 389 and 414parsecs. Consequently, it is likely that Betelgeuse has not always had its current motion through space but has changed course at one time or another, possibly the result of a nearby stellar explosion. An observation by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2013 revealed that the star's winds are crashing against the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E
500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral <b>class</b> <b>M.</b> In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} spectral <b>class</b> <b>M,</b> the coolest type in the long-standing classical stellar sequence, is an optical spectrum dominated by absorption bands of titanium(II) oxide (TiO) and vanadium(II) oxide (VO) molecules.

The subsequent identification of many objects like GD 165B ultimately led {{to the definition of}} a new spectral class, the L dwarfs, defined in the red optical region of the spectrum not by absorption metal-oxide bands (TiO, VO), but [...] metal hydride emission bands (FeH, CrH, MgH, CaH) and prominent alkali metal lines (Na I, K I, Cs I, Rb I). , over 900 Ldwarfs have been identified, most by wide-field surveys: the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), the Deep Near Infrared Survey of the Southern Sky (DENIS), and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).|$|E
