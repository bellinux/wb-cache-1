25|$|Most animals {{move in the}} {{direction}} of their head. However, there are some exceptions. Crabs move sideways, and naked mole rats, which live in tight tunnels underground, can move backward or forward with equal facility. Crayfish can move backward much faster than they <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|E
25|$|Senator Johnson urged Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates to {{act quickly}} on the recommendation. “... {{it is my hope}} that both you and the President <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> on Master Sergeant Keeble’s case as expeditiously as possible,” Johnson said in a letter to Gates quoted in the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.|$|E
25|$|She criticizes H.G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, John Galsworthy {{of writing}} about {{unimportant}} things and called them materialists. She {{suggests that it}} would be better for literature to turn their backs on them so it <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward,</b> for better or worse. While Woolf criticizes the aforementioned three authors, she praises several other authors for their innovation. This group of writers she names spiritualists, and includes James Joyce who Woolf says writes what interests and moves him.|$|E
50|$|The Granite Grinder set {{is one of}} the {{medium-sized}} sets. One of {{its most}} noticeable aspects is the large drill on the front, as well as the presence of legs instead of wheels. The legs <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forwards</b> and backwards. The set includes one Axle minifig. First Editions include one comic.|$|R

25|$|Critics object {{claiming}} that the ASEAN Way's emphasis on consultation, consensus, and non-interference, forces the organisation to adopt only those policies which satisfy the lowest common denominator. Decision making by consensus requires members to see eye-to-eye before ASEAN <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> on an issue. Members {{may not have a}} common conception of the meaning of the ASEAN Way. Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos emphasise non-interference while older member countries focus on co-operation and co-ordination. These differences hinder efforts to find common solutions to particular issues, but also make it difficult to determine when collective action is appropriate in a given situation.|$|E
25|$|Controlling each {{character}} is broadly similar. Each <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> and backward, can strafe left and right, can run, walk, crouch, and jump. Each shares an identical HUD, {{with the same}} information available to the player; {{the location of the}} mission objective and the location of the other character. At certain times, the HUD will also contain other information, such as the location of a shop or an indication that the player character needs help from his brother. When the player is reloading or selecting a weapon, their available weaponry, ammo count and cash are also displayed. Both characters can wield six shooters, shotguns, and rifles. Both characters can also interact with certain objects, such as chairs, oil lamps, ammo and dropped weaponry.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the style}} of play for both {{characters}} is slightly different, controlling each character is broadly similar. Each <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> and backward, can strafe left and right, can run, walk, sneak, and jump. Each shares an identical HUD, with the same information available to the player; currently held weapons, ammo count, a compass with objectives marked, and current health points. Both characters can single and/or dual wield six shooters, or single wield other weapons, such as rifles. Both characters can also lean {{to the left and}} right without moving from their current position, and can interact with certain objects, such as health pick-ups (in the Xbox 360 version, health automatically regenerates over time), ammo and dropped weaponry. The main differences between the two characters is that Ray is stronger and slower, he cannot jump as high as Billy, but he can kick heavy obstacles out of his way and take considerably more damage from enemy fire. Billy can move faster than Ray and is quieter, allowing him to sneak up on enemies. He can also grip onto ledges and pull himself up. Billy can also use two weapons Ray cannot - a whip, and a bow and arrow.|$|E
50|$|The Hounds move first. Each player <b>can</b> <b>move</b> {{one piece}} one step in each turn. The Hounds <b>can</b> only <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> or diagonally (left to right) or {{vertically}} (up and down). The Hare <b>can</b> <b>move</b> in any direction.|$|R
50|$|A man <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forwards</b> or {{sideways}} to an orthogonally adjacent field, if that field is empty. If {{there is an}} opposing piece on that field and the field behind the piece (in direction of the movement) is empty, the opposing piece can be captured by a jump, with the capturing piece going to said empty field. Additionally, pieces <b>can</b> <b>move,</b> but not capture, one square diagonally forward. There is no backward movement or capture for men.|$|R

500|$|Flexion {{describes}} a bending movement that decreases the angle between a segment and its proximal segment. [...] For example, bending the elbow, or clenching a {{hand into a}} fist, are examples of flexion. When sitting down, the knees are flexed. When a joint <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> and backward, such as the neck and trunk, flexion refers to movement in the anterior direction. Flexion of the shoulder or hip refers to movement of the arm or leg forward.|$|E
500|$|Extension is the {{opposite}} of flexion, describing a straightening movement that increases the angle between body parts. When a joint <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> and backward, such as the neck and trunk, extension refers to movement in the posterior direction. For example, when standing up, the knees are extended. Extension of the hip or shoulder moves the arm or leg backward. When the chin is against the chest, the head is flexed, and the trunk is flexed when a person leans forward.|$|E
500|$|The pawn <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> to the unoccupied square {{immediately}} {{in front of}} it on the same file, or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied (black dots in the diagram); or the pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally {{in front of it}} on an adjacent file, by moving to that square (black [...] "x"s). A pawn has two special moves: the en passant capture and promotion.|$|E
5000|$|Simple move: A simple move {{consists}} of moving a piece one square diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied dark square. Uncrowned pieces <b>can</b> <b>move</b> diagonally <b>forward</b> only; kings <b>can</b> <b>move</b> in any diagonal direction.|$|R
5000|$|Piece {{moves are}} as in {{standard}} shogi, {{apart from the}} queen (妃将 or 妃 hishō or okisaki [...] "princess") and the knights (跳馬 or 跳 chōma), which move as in Western chess, and the lance, which <b>can</b> <b>move</b> directly <b>forward</b> or backwards (standard shogi knights and lances <b>can</b> only <b>move</b> <b>forward.)</b> An opposing piece is captured by displacement: That is, if a piece moves to a square occupied by an opposing piece, the opposing piece is displaced and removed from the board. A piece cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly piece (meaning another piece controlled by the moving player).|$|R
5000|$|The acetabula are wider {{apart in}} females than in males. In males, the {{acetabulum}} faces more laterally, while it faces more anteriorly in females. Consequently, when males walk the leg <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forwards</b> and backwards {{in a single}} plane. In females, the leg must swing forward and inward, from where the pivoting {{head of the femur}} moves the leg back in another plane. This change in the angle of the femoral head gives the female gait its characteristic (i.e. swinging of hips).|$|R
500|$|Easily {{accessible}} {{items are}} picked off the tree surface or from fissures in the bark, but larvae are extracted by chiselling holes up to [...] deep and trapping the soft insect with the tongue, which can extend to [...] beyond the bill, and {{is covered with}} bristles and sticky saliva to trap the prey. The woodpecker is able to extend its tongue so far because the hyoid bone {{to which it is}} attached has long flexible [...] "horns" [...] that wind around the skull and <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> when required.|$|E
500|$|Endgames {{with one}} or more pawns {{increase}} the complexity because the symmetry argument is reduced. Since pawns <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> but not sideways, rotation and vertical reflection of the board produces a fundamental change {{in the nature of the}} position. The best calculation of symmetry is achieved by limiting one pawn to 24 squares in the rectangle a2-a7-d7-d2. [...] All other pieces and pawns may be located in any of the 64 squares with respect to the pawn. [...] Thus, an endgame with pawns has a complexity of 24/10 = 2.4 times a pawnless endgame with the same number of pieces.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "Save Mauna Kea" [...] movement, {{believes}} {{development of}} the mountain to be sacrilegious. Native Hawaiian non-profit groups such as Kahea, concerned with cultural heritage and the environment also oppose development for cultural and religious reasons. The multi-telescope [...] "outrigger", proposed in 2006 was eventually canceled. A planned new telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), has attracted controversy and protests. The TMT was approved in April 2013. In October 2014, the groundbreaking ceremony for the telescope was interrupted by protesters causing the project to temporarily halt. In late March 2015, demonstrators blocked access {{of the road to}} the summit again. On April 2, 2015, 300 protestors were gathered near the visitor's center when 12 people were arrested with 11 more arrested at the summit. Among the concerns of the protest groups are the land appraisals and Native Hawaiians consultation. Construction was halted on April 7, 2015 after protests expanded over the state. After several halts, the project has been voluntarily postponed. Governor Ige announced substantial changes to the management of Mauna Kea in the future but stated the project <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward.</b> A pending court case has been accepted by the Supreme Court of Hawaii over the project by a number of groups.|$|E

Their eyes are quite small, and their visual acuity is poor. Their legs are thin and short; however, {{they are highly}} adept at moving underground and can move backward {{as fast as they}} <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward.</b> Their large, protruding teeth are used to dig and their lips are sealed just behind the teeth, preventing soil from filling their mouths while digging. About a quarter of their musculature is used in the closing of their jaws while they dig—about the same proportion that is utilized in the human leg. They have little hair (hence the common name) and wrinkled pink or yellowish skin. They lack an insulating layer in the skin.|$|E
2500|$|On October 31, 1996, Huckabee met {{privately with}} {{the parole board}} {{to talk about the}} DuMond case. The Arkansas Times has argued that this closed-door meeting {{appeared}} to violate Arkansas' FOIA law. [...] On January 16, 1997, DuMond was granted parole, just five months after he had been rejected. Huckabee released a statement saying, [...] "I concur with the board's action and hope the lives of all those involved <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward.</b> The action of the board accomplishes what I sought to do in considering an earlier request for commutation ...In light of the action of the board, my original intent to commute the sentence to time served is no longer relevant." [...] The parole was granted on the condition that DuMond leave the state.
