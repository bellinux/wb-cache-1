50|$|The <b>coping</b> <b>saw</b> blade is {{installed}} with the teeth pointing towards the handle. Unlike a hacksaw, {{which has the}} teeth pointed away from the handle, the <b>coping</b> <b>saw</b> cuts on the pull stroke. The <b>coping</b> <b>saw</b> blade is removable by partially unscrewing the handle. The blade is prevented from rotating {{by means of the}} short, steady bar provided where the blade is attached. Loosening the handle also allows the blade to be rotated relative to the frame as desired. Carefully aligning the finger with the steady bars at {{the top and bottom of}} the blade ensures that the thin blade is straight and not twisted along its length. Retightening the handle tensions the blade and locks it at the desired angle relative to the frame. The short steady bar nearest the handle is held securely between finger and thumb while the handle is tightened to ensure the blade remains at the desired angle. Unlike the fretsaw the <b>coping</b> <b>saw</b> blade has holding pins which lock securely into the angled slots of the rotatable blade holders.|$|E

50|$|A <b>coping</b> <b>saw</b> {{is a type}} of {{hand saw}} used to cut {{intricate}} external shapes and interior cut-outs in woodworking or carpentry. It is widely used to cut moldings to create coped rather than miter joints.

5000|$|The Japanese saw or nokogiri (...) {{is a type}} of saw used in {{woodworking}} and Japanese carpentry {{that cuts}} on the pull stroke, unlike most European saws that cut on the push stroke. Japanese saws are the best known pull saws, but they are also used in Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Nepal. Among European <b>saws,</b> both <b>coping</b> <b>saws</b> for woodworking and jewelers saws for metal working also cut on the pull stroke like Japanese saws. Cutting on the pull stroke is claimed to cut more efficiently and leave a narrower cut width (...) [...] On the other hand, a pull stroke does not easily permit putting ones body weight behind a stroke. This can be readily solved by using a vise or clamping. Another disadvantage, due to the arrangement and form of the teeth , is that Japanese saws do not work as well on hardwoods as European saws do. Japanese saws were originally intended for comparatively soft woods like cypress and pine whereas European saws were intended for hard woods like oak and maple.|$|R

60|$|One wet spring {{afternoon}} {{the sky was}} full of broken clouds, and the common was swept by their shadows, between which patches of green and yellow gorse were bright in the broken sunlight. The hills to the northward were obscured by a heavy shower, traces of which were drying off the slates of the school, a square white building, formerly a gentleman's country-house. In front {{of it was a}} well-kept lawn with a few clipped holly-trees. At the rear, a quarter of an acre of land was enclosed {{for the use of the}} boys. Strollers on the common could hear, at certain hours, a hubbub of voices and racing footsteps from within the boundary wall. Sometimes, when the strollers were boys themselves, they climbed to the <b>coping,</b> and <b>saw</b> on the other side a piece of common trampled bare and brown, with a few square yards of concrete, so worn into hollows as to be unfit for its original use as a ball-alley. Also a long shed, a pump, a door defaced by innumerable incised inscriptions, the back of the house in much worse repair than the front, and about fifty boys in tailless jackets and broad, turned-down collars. When the fifty boys perceived a stranger on the wall they rushed to the spot with a wild halloo, overwhelmed him with insult and defiance, and dislodged him by a volley of clods, stones, lumps of bread, and such other projectiles as were at hand.|$|R
6000|$|From {{this point}} the {{movements}} of Young Glengarry become rather difficult to trace. If we could believe the information received from Rob Roy's son, James Mohr Macgregor, by Craigie, the Lord Advocate, Young Glengarry came over to Scotland in La Doutelle, when Charles landed in Moidart in July 1745. {150a} This was not true. Old Glengarry, with Lord George Murray, waited on Cope at Crieff in August, when Cope marched north. <b>Cope</b> writes, 'I <b>saw</b> Glengarry the father at Crieff with the Duke of Athol; 'tis said that none of his followers are yet out, tho' there is some doubt of his youngest son; the eldest, as Glengarry told me, is in France.' {150b} On September 14, Forbes of Culloden congratulated Old Glengarry on his return home, and regretted {{that so many of}} his clan were out under Lochgarry, a kinsman. {150c} Old Glengarry had written to Forbes 'lamenting the folly of his friends.' He, like Lovat, was really 'sitting on the fence.' His clan was out; his second son AEneas led it at Falkirk. Alastair was in France. At the close of 1745, Alastair, conveying a detachment of the Royal Scots, in French service, and a piquet of the Irish brigade to Scotland, was captured on the seas and imprisoned in the Tower of London. {150d} In January 1746 we find him writing from the Tower to Waters, the banker in Paris, asking for money. Almost at this very time Young Glengarry's younger brother, AEneas, who led the clan, was accidentally shot in the streets of Falkirk by a Macdonald of Clanranald's regiment. The poor Macdonald was executed, and the Glengarry leader, by Charles's desire, was buried in the grave of Wallace's companion, Sir John the Graeme, as the only worthy resting-place.

40|$|Women {{from poor}} {{communities}} in Northeast Thailand {{can be considered}} as a disadvantaged group who have struggled against several problems in their daily living and who have worked hard to sustain their lives through unskilled labour. In such a strong Buddhist culture these women have vital roles within the household and in earning money. The combination of which it is suggested, has had an impact on their physical and psychological health. In Thailand, there is limited data available about such women's health, life experience and work. A better understanding of their situation is required in order to inform and redesign effective health intervention programmes to promote {{the health and well-being of}} women from these communities. An holistic nursing perspective was used to inform the design of this research. Only by understanding the context, the living experiences and the understandings of the women themselves is it possible to construct effective health intervention programmes. Thus the purpose of the study was to understand women's health and work in the sociocultural context of poverty in Northeast Thailand. A combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques were used in the overall data collection process. The study was conducted in two distinct phases. Phase 1 provided an overall of baseline account of the socio-cultural context of six communities and the health of a sample of women who live therein. It involved focus group interviews (N= 102) with residents and a survey (N= 209) of households. Phase 2 was a more focused case study (N= 49) of women's life experiences, their health and work in one selected community. Phase 1 of the study found that the majority of women had a substantial role in household economics. Coping strategies that women frequently used were `Tam Chai' (accept and not think too much about it). The majority of women in the communities were primary breadwinners and were self-employed as vendors. Regarding women's health, the findings showed a high level of musculoskeletal and psychological complaints. The study showed that nearly all of the women were optimists and felt happy. In the second phase of the study. Buddhism and the Thai way of living emerged as the major factors which influenced women's views on health and well being. The data illustrated that women struggled to survive in the community and that they had to work hard to make ends meet. Women used networks in the community as resources for <b>coping.</b> They <b>saw</b> `health in terms of being strong enough to work and earn a living'. Health per se is the lowest priority in their life. To work and earn money to support their families is the highest. Indeed, the Buddhist teaching of `self-reliance' has a great impact on them. The conclusions reached suggest that nursing interventions and health campaigns could be used to promote and maintain the optimum health of women and their families. Finally recommendations are made with regard to further research; development of services; development of nurse-education and health promotion for women in low-income communities.

50|$|A {{scroll saw}} {{is a small}} {{electric}} or pedal-operated saw used to cut intricate curves in wood, metal, or other materials. The fineness of its blade allows it to cut more delicately than a power jigsaw, and more easily than a hand <b>coping</b> <b>saw.</b> Like those tools, {{it is capable of}} creating curves with edges, by pivoting its table.|$|E
50|$|The <b>coping</b> <b>saw</b> {{was most}} likely invented in middle of the 16th century {{following}} innovations in metallurgy and with {{the invention of the}} spring-driven clock. Blades made of this material were strong and flexible thanks to rolling. This saw was also used in combination with so called Chevalet du Marqueterie, invented in 1780, allowing to saw pack of veneers with one angle of cut.|$|E
50|$|While {{somewhat}} {{similar to a}} band saw, a scroll saw uses a reciprocating blade rather than a continuous loop. Like a hand <b>coping</b> <b>saw,</b> the scroll saw's blade can be removed and placed through a pre-drilled starting hole, allowing interior cutouts to be made without an entry slot. Also, the fineness in both width and tooth count of a scroll's blade permits significantly more intricate curves than even the narrowest gauge band-saw blade.|$|E
50|$|The fretsaw is a saw {{used for}} {{intricate}} cutting work which often incorporates tight curves. Although the <b>coping</b> <b>saw</b> {{is often used}} for similar work, the fretsaw is capable of much tighter radii and more delicate work. It has a distinctive appearance due to the depth of its frame (typically between 10 and 20 inches), which together with the relatively short five inch blade makes this tool appear somewhat out of proportion compared with most other saws.|$|E
50|$|A <b>coping</b> <b>saw</b> (with {{the correct}} blade) {{can also be}} used to cut through {{aluminium}} tubing and other metal objects, though a hacksaw is much more efficient for this task. The thin blade tends to make wavy cuts in thick materials unless skill is achieved through much practice on a wide variety of materials of varying thicknesses. The stroke length before the frame strikes the material above or below is the limiting factor in the maximum thickness of material. The work becomes progressively more difficult and tiring with increasing thickness of material.|$|E
50|$|Fretwork is an {{interlaced}} decorative {{design that}} is either carved in low relief on a solid background, or cut {{out with a}} fretsaw, <b>coping</b> <b>saw,</b> jigsaw or scroll saw.

The term is also used for tracery on glazed windows and doors. Fretwork {{is also used to}} adorn/decorate architecture, where specific elements of decor are named according to their use such as eave bracket, gable fretwork or baluster fretwork, which may be of metal, especially cast iron or aluminum.|$|E
50|$|Mike Rainville {{first came}} to {{woodworking}} as a hobby when he was 11. At that time, his mother, Pat, told him that, “he needed {{to find something to}} do.” Rainville’s grandparents had a history of working with their hands, specifically woodworking and farming, so there were always materials around to utilize. Rainville made his first items, spools and bobbin holders, in his parents’ basement in Lincoln, Vermont, using some spare wood, a <b>coping</b> <b>saw,</b> and a sanding block. As time progressed, he started making cribbage boards which are still being made today. Local craft fairs provided him with income to purchase new equipment and materials. By 1979, Rainville had established his first wholesale relationship.|$|E
50|$|A <b>coping</b> <b>saw</b> {{consists}} of a thin, hardened steel blade, stretched between the ends of a square, c shaped, springy-iron frame to which a handle is attached. The blade is easily removed from the frame so that the blade can be passed through a drilled hole {{in the middle of}} a piece of wood. The frame is then re-attached to the blade and the cut starts from the middle of the piece. Long cuts perpendicular to the edge of the material are possible but the shallow depth of the frame rather limits how far from the edge one may cut. The much deeper frame of the fretsaw is more useful for cutting well away from the edge but conversely cannot manage the thicker materials commonly cut by the coping saws.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{intended for}} woodwork, metal cutting blades {{are readily available}} increasing the versatility of this saw. Spiral blades are also available which have teeth {{on all sides of}} the blade, and will cut in any direction without the need to rotate either the saw or the work piece. This can be useful when access is restricted due {{to the size of the}} component being worked, and compensate in part for the inability to rotate the blade in the manner possible with a <b>coping</b> <b>saw.</b> However, they also have a wider [...] and as such remove more material than a conventional blade. These alternative blades make the fretsaw suitable for many tasks traditionally performed by the piercing saw, although piercing saw blades are typically finer still than the finest fretsaw blade.|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} {{variation of}} the ring construction technique is known as [...] "bowl from a board." [...] Imagine a flat, square board bisected to create two identical rectangles, like two twin beds placed side-by-side to form a king-sized, square bed. Rings are created by cutting concentric semicircles {{from each of the}} two boards, one concentric half-ring a mirrored-shape of a half-ring from the other. The semicircles are typically cut with a bandsaw, but a scrollsaw, jigsaw, or <b>coping</b> <b>saw</b> would work. The blade of the saw used to cut the semicircles is set at an angle from the vertical, typically 45-60 degrees, such that when each mirrored pair is glued together to form a complete ring, the rings are shaped like cross sections of a cone. The rings are then stacked to create a cone-shaped blank. An incredible variety of visual effects can be achieved as a function of how the boards are constructed before the concentric rings are cut.|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally, a bow saw is a {{woodworking}} tool used for straight or curved cuts. A bow saw {{is a type}} of frame saw. Its thin blade is held in tension by a frame. In English and American vocabulary it denotes a toothed blade suspended between two long narrow handles called [...] "cheeks" [...] that are supported and separated by a thin stretcher {{in the center of the}} handles, making a wide H shape (the cheeks form the uprights of the H, the stretcher the crossbar of the H). The blade is kept in tension with a turnbuckle or a twisted cord that runs parallel to the blade between the two cheeks but on the opposite side of the stretcher. If a cord is used, the cord is twisted with a toggle attached to one loop of the cord, adding tension. The toggle hits the stretcher, which keeps the cord from untwisting. A finer version of the saw uses a narrow blade (1/4" [...] or less) with handles that allow the user to hold the saw and turn the blade. In this context it is also known as a turning saw which is larger than a <b>coping</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of precision laser targets requires {{a wide variety}} of specialized mesoscale manufacturing techniques. The diamond wire saw developed in this study provides the capability to precisely section meso-scale workpieces mounted on the assembly stations used by the Target Fabrication Group. This new capability greatly simplifies the {{fabrication of}} many types of targets and reduces the time and cost required to build the targets. A variety of materials are used to fabricate targets, including metals, plastics with custom designed chemical formulas, and aerogels of various densities. The materials are usually provided in the form of small pieces or cast rods that must be machined to the required shape. Many of these materials, such as metals and some plastics, can be trimmed using a parting tool on a diamond turning machine. However, other materials, such as aerogels and brittle materials, cannot be adequately cut with a parting tool. In addition, the geometry of the parts often requires that the workpieces be held in a special assembly station, which excludes the use of a parting tool. In the past, these materials were sectioned using a small, handheld <b>coping</b> <b>saw</b> that used a diamond-impregnated wire as a blade. This miniature <b>coping</b> <b>saw</b> was effective, but it required several hours to cut through certain materials. Furthermore, the saw was guided by hand and often caused significant damage to fragile aerogels. To solve these problems, the diamond wire saw shown in Figure 1 was developed. The diamond wire saw is designed to machine through materials that are mounted in the Target Fabrication Group's benchtop assembly stations. These assembly stations are the primary means of aligning and assembling target components, and there is often a need to machine materials while they are mounted in the assembly stations. Unfortunately, commercially available saws are designed for very different applications and are far too large to be used with the assembly stations. Therefore, a custom diamond wire saw was designed and constructed. The diamond wire saw cuts through workpieces using a continuous loop of diamond-impregnated wire of length 840 mm. The wire loop runs around several idler pulleys and is driven by a simple geared DC motor that rotates at 17 rpm. The linear speed of the wire is 107 inches/minute. The saw is oriented at an angle of 20 {sup o} from horizontal, so the operator can view the wire through the cutout at {{the front end of the}} saw. When looking through a microscope or camera with a horizontal line of sight, the operator can clearly see the wire as it cuts through the workpiece, as shown in the right side of Figure 1. The saw is mounted on a two-axis stage that allows the operator to align the wire with the workpiece. To cut through the workpiece, the operator drives the wire through the workpiece by turning the feed micrometer. An image of the interior of the diamond wire saw appears in Figure 2. This picture was taken after removing the protective cover plate from the saw...|$|E
