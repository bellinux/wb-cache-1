Montrose was at that time becoming a prominent gayborhood in Houston, and was the first gay bar to open on a main road, as well as to have windows. Joe Anthony had bought the property, which was a bar named Tommy's, and refurbished it into Mary's. [...] Mary's was bought by Jim [...] "Fanny" [...] Farmer in 1970, with Cliff Owens becoming co-owner sometime in the late 1970s. In Mary's early days, it became tradition for patrons' underwear to be hung from the rafters, until the state health department required the bar to take them down in the late 1980s. Unlike other local gay bars, Mary's never adopted a dress code. The bar also adopted a cat mascot, which they named Mr. Balls, after he began living in the area around the bar and fell out of a tree outside. Mr. Balls was given his own bar stool at the main table.

40|$|Abstract—This work is {{concerned}} with improving the robustness of phoneme classification to additive noise with hybrid features using support vector machines (SVMs). In particular, the cepstral features are combined with local energy features of acoustic waveform segments to form a hybrid representation. The local energy features {{are taken into account}} separately in the SVM kernel, and a simple subtraction method allows them to be adapted effectively in noise. This hybrid representation with mean and variance normalization of the cepstral features contributes significantly to the robustness of phoneme classification and narrows the performance gap to the ideal baseline of classifiers trained under matched noise conditions. Further improvements are obtained by extending the multiclass prediction method from standard discrete error-correcting codes to adaptive continuous codes.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} are often difficult and expensive to make. To bypass these issues, industrial companies have developed computational codes. These codes {{intend to be}} representative of the physical system, but come {{with a certain amount of}} problems. Code validation is representative of one of these issues, related to the fact that the code intends to be as close as possible to the physical system. It turns out that, despite <b>continuous</b> <b>code</b> development, the difference between code output and experiments can remain significant. Two kinds of uncertainties are observed. The first comes from the difference between the physical phenomenon and the values recorded experimentally which is often represented by a white Gaussian noise. The second concerns the gap between the code and the physical system. To reduce this difference, often named model bias, or model error, computer codes are generally complexified in order to make them more realistic. These improvements lead to time consuming codes. Moreover, a code often depends on parameters to be set by the user to make the code as close as possible to field data. This estimation task is called calibration and can be performed with a time consuming or a fast code with or without model discrepancy. This paper provides a review of the main calibration methods developed to date. An application case will be used to illustrate the decisions taken along the article and to discuss divergence points.

40|$|Establishing and {{preserving}} {{a high level}} of software quality is a not a trivial task, although the benefits of succeeding with this task has been proven profitable and advantageous. An approach to mitigate the decreasing quality of a project is to track metrics and certain properties of the project, in order to view the progression of the project’s properties. This approach may be carried out by introducing <b>continuous</b> <b>code</b> inspection with the application of static code analysis. However, as the initial common opinion is that these type of tools produce a too high number of false positives, {{there is a need to}} investigate what the actual case is. This is the origin for the investigation and case study performed in this paper. The case study is performed at Ida Infront AB in Linköping, Sweden and involves interviews with developers to determine the performance of the continuous inspection platform SonarQube, in addition to examine the general opinion among developers at the company. The author executes the implementation and configuration of a continuous inspection environment to analyze a partition of the company’s product and determine what rules that are appropriate to apply in the company’s context. The results from the investigation indicate the high quality and accuracy of the tool, in addition to the advantageous functionality of continuously monitoring the code to observe trends and the progression of metrics such as cyclomatic complexity and duplicated code, with the goal of preventing the constant increase of complex and duplicated code. Combining this with features such as false positive suppression, instant analysis feedback in pull requests and the possibility to break the build given specified conditions, suggests that the implemented environment is a way to mitigate software quality difficulties. 建立和保持高水平的软件质量可以带来经济利益等诸多好处，然而这是一项很困难的任务。其中一种防止软件项目质量下降的方法是通过跟踪项目的度量值和某些属性，来查看项目的属性的变化情况。通过引入持续的代码审查和应用静态代码分析方法可以实现这种方法。然而，在人们的印象中，这类工具往往具有较高的误检，因此需要进一步调查实际情况、研究其可行性，这是本文的初始研究目标。本文在瑞典林雪平的Ida Infront AB公司开展了案例研究，调研了该公司开发人员的意见，并通过访问开发人员，确定持续的代码审查平台SonarQube的性能。作者对持续的代码审查环境进行了配置，分析了公司的部分产品，进而确定哪些规则适用于该公司。调查结果表明该工具是高质量并且准确的，还提供了持续监测代码来观察度量值的趋势和进展等先进功能，例如通过监测环路复杂度和重复代码等度量值，来防止复杂度和重复代码的增加。通过组合误检压缩、对pull requests的瞬间分析反馈、以及分解和建立给定的条件等特征，使得所实现的环境成为一种可以降低软件质量保障难度的方式...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper looks into {{designing}} high density residential architecture that enables certain qualities, {{in order to improve}} the livability and perception of the design. A parametric design approach was chosen for this project in order to enable these qualities. First, several important conditions and criteria for this project were formed. These form guiding principles for the parametric models. This is important, since parametric modeling software can often lead to reflexive design criteria and unnecessary complexity. In order to avoid this, relation to context and social relevance become important guiding criteria. View, daylight, orientation and privacy are all guiding criteria that contribute to this social relevance. The first Grasshopper model was then created. By switching between different domains (or design aspects) within a design process, and combining their results, a qualitative design can eventually be created. The first Grasshopper model, however, forms a more linear process, in which every step within the created model is placed within one <b>continuous</b> <b>code.</b> A second Grasshopper model was then created. This model showed promise by allowing better differentiation between de different design domains. However, by basing the input parameters of the second Grasshopper model on a gradient image, the input parameters became in a way fixed within this model. With the help of parametric form-finding, the architect can create a certain kind of differentiation of elements within his design, giving him more freedom in the composition of the design within the design process. However, parametric codes are created with a certain algorithmic logic. This can be limiting the creative freedom of the designer and a design could then possibly lose its human-touch. Therefore, the designer should always be in control over the parametric code he created, changing the role of the designer from a physical designer to a more virtual designer, a programmer, who is in control of all the aspects of parametric design (input, algorithmic process and output). By reflecting on each Grasshopper model, {{in order to understand the}} strengths and weaknesses, the complexity of the design process of designing high density housing itself could be made more understandable and rationalized. However, according to certain Literature (Simon 1973; Lawson 1980) the design process can never be fully rationalized. This is because the design process can also be described as ill-structured. Understanding the advantages of the computer in well-structured problems and its disadvantages in ill-structured problems, is also important for understanding the need for heuristics within the parametric design approach. Rowe (1982) states that the architectural design process is inherent heuristic. This means that the further a design process advances, more conditions become clear and therefore, the better the design process could be rationalized by the designer or architect. Within the design and development of the parametric tool itself, this would mean that perhaps a parametric code / program could be designed in such a way, that it can rewrite itself according to what it has learned. In languages that support Object Oriented Programming (OOP) an object can be seen as a structure that contains both data and procedures. Understanding these procedures will enable the designer to reflect on the input and output data, making a cooperative and iterative trial-and-error process possible between the computer and the designer.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a <b>coded</b> <b>continuous</b> wave {{specular}} meteor radar (SMR) is described. The radar uses a continuously transmitted pseudorandom phase-modulated waveform, which has several advantages compared to conventional pulsed SMRs. The coding avoids range and Doppler aliasing, which are in some cases problematic with pulsed radars. Continuous transmissions maximize pulse compression gain, allowing operation at lower peak power than a pulsed system. With <b>continuous</b> <b>coding,</b> the temporal and spectral resolution are not dependent on the transmit waveform {{and they can be}} fairly flexibly changed after performing a measurement. The low signal-to-noise ratio before pulse compression, combined with independent pseudorandom transmit waveforms, allows multiple geographically separated transmitters {{to be used in the}} same frequency band simultaneously without significantly interfering with each other. Because the same frequency band can be used by multiple transmitters, the same interferometric receiver antennas can be used to receive multiple transmitters at the same time. The principles of the signal processing are discussed, in addition to discussion of several practical ways to increase computation speed, and how to optimally detect meteor echoes. Measurements from a campaign performed with a <b>coded</b> <b>continuous</b> wave SMR are shown and compared with two standard pulsed SMR measurements. The type of meteor radar described in this paper would be suited for use in a large-scale multi-static network of meteor radar transmitters and receivers.

40|$|Abstract. Non-malleable codes (NMCs), {{introduced}} by Dziembowski, Pietrzak and Wichs [DPW 10], provide a useful message integrity guar-antee {{in situations where}} traditional error-correction (and even error-detection) is impossible; for example, when the attacker can completely overwrite the encoded message. NMCs have emerged as a fundamental object {{at the intersection of}} coding theory and cryptography. A large body of the recent work has focused on various constructions of non-malleable codes in the split-state model. Many variants of NMCs have been introduced in the literature i. e. strong NMCs, super strong NMCs and continuous NMCs. Perhaps the most useful notion among these is that of <b>continuous</b> non-malleable <b>codes,</b> that allows for continu-ous tampering by the adversary. In this paper we give the first efficient, information-theoretic secure con-struction of <b>continuous</b> non-malleable <b>codes</b> in 2 -split-state model. En-route to our main result, we obtain constructions for almost all possible notion of non-malleable codes that have been considered in the split-state model, and for which such a construction is possible. Our result is ob-tained by a series of black-box reductions starting from the non-malleable codes from [ADL 14]. One of the main technical ingredient of our result is a new concept that we call inception coding. We believe it may be of independent interest. ...|$|R
