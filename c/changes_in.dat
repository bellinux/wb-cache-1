We {{examined}} if <b>change</b> <b>in</b> self-compassion was indirectly related to <b>change</b> <b>in</b> well-being through <b>change</b> <b>in</b> psychological need satisfaction {{during the first}} year of university.   Methods  First year university students (N= 189, 77. 2 % female) completed self-report questionnaires at the beginning of the first semester and approximately five months later. Path analysis and bootstrapping procedures were used to examine residualized change scores.   Results  <b>Change</b> <b>in</b> self-compassion was positively related to (ps< 0. 05) <b>change</b> <b>in</b> psychological need satisfaction (β= 0. 49) and negatively related to <b>change</b> <b>in</b> negative affect (β=− 0. 24). <b>Change</b> <b>in</b> psychological need satisfaction was positively associated (ps< 0. 05) with <b>change</b> <b>in</b> vitality (β= 0. 58) and <b>change</b> <b>in</b> positive affect (β= 0. 52) and negatively associated with <b>change</b> <b>in</b> negative affect (β=− 0. 29). <b>Change</b> <b>in</b> self-compassion was indirectly related to <b>change</b> <b>in</b> vitality (b= 0. 56, 95 % bootstrapped bias corrected confidence interval (BcCI) [0. 38, 0. 77]), positive affect (b= 0. 41, 95 %BcCI [0. 27, 0. 58]), and negative affect (b=− 0. 26, 95 %BcCI[− 0. 41, − 0. 13]) through <b>change</b> <b>in</b> psychological need satisfaction.   Conclusions  During the first year of university, <b>change</b> <b>in</b> self-compassion was associated with <b>change</b> <b>in</b> well-being because self-compassion enhanced psychological need satisfaction.
