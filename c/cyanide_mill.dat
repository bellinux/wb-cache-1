25|$|After the Cripple Creek strike, Eben Smith slowly {{began to}} pull his {{investments}} out mines. Returning to his interest in milling, he built a <b>cyanide</b> process <b>mill</b> near Florence in 1895. It was the largest <b>cyanide</b> process gold <b>mill</b> {{of its kind in}} the world at the time. Smith continued to extend the F railroad, and built an electric power plant at Goldfield. But Smith sold most of his investments, including interest in his many mines, throughout the 1890s. He re-invested some of the money in mines in Utah, Arizona and Oregon.|$|R
50|$|During 1896-97, De Lamar {{acquired}} claims {{within the}} gold district of Mercur and {{had built a}} 500-ton <b>cyanide</b> process <b>mill,</b> later expanded to 1,000 ton, which {{was said to be}} the largest of the time, to work the mines. Jackling followed DeLamar to Utah as mill superintendent. During his Cripple Creek and Mercur operations years, he also invested in gold mines in Lincoln County, Nevada, that from 1896 to 1902 paid him $8,000,000 in profits. At the Delamar Mine, Nevada, the barrel-chlorinating process was installed in 1895 and soon later discarded in favour of fine grinding and cyaniding.|$|R

5000|$|Sutro Tunnel Coalition/Crown Point Mill After {{several years}} of {{exploration}} and development on the Crown Point claim in Gold Hill, the Sutro Tunnel Coalition built a 100 ton-per-day <b>cyanide</b> <b>mill</b> to process both underground and surface mined ore in 1935. The mill and mine development was accomplished with a $160,000 loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which was paid back in under 3 years of operation. The Crown Point Mill operated profitably, treating primarily ores from the Crown Point and Yellow Jacket claims, until it was shut down by War Production Board Order L-208 in 1942.|$|E
50|$|In 1920, the United Comstock Mines Company was {{organized}} by prominent Comstock mining engineers Roy Hardy and Alex Wise with financial backing by New York businessman Harry Payne Whitney. United Comstock consolidated ownership of the entire Gold Hill section of the Comstock Lode representing 5,000 feet of strike length and a mill site in American Flat. This enterprise constructed the 2,500 ton-per-day capacity American Flat <b>cyanide</b> <b>mill</b> (the {{largest in the world}} at the time) and drove a tunnel 9,585 feet from the mill under Gold Hill. The economics of this project were tenuous, and with a drop in silver prices, it closed in 1924.|$|E
50|$|Cedar was a gold, {{silver and}} copper mining town in Mohave County, Arizona. It was founded around 1875 {{on the east}} slope of the Hualapai Mountains, sixty miles {{southeast}} of Kingman. A post office was established on September 24, 1895 and closed on July 31, 1911. In addition {{to the post office}} there were two saloons, and a general store with several homes. In 1907 the Cedar Valley Gold & Silver Company along with the Yucca <b>Cyanide</b> Mining & <b>Milling</b> Company reported that about 200 people lived in the town, within a decade later the site was abandoned. A half mile area inside Cedar Valley is littered with stone ruins and foundations of the mining buildings.|$|R
40|$|Mine and mill {{effluents}} {{are often}} contaminated with ammonia-N due {{to use of}} ammonia based compounds, such as ammonia-based explosives (ANFO), flotation reagents in <b>milling,</b> <b>cyanide</b> destruction, and as a pH regulator (uranium precipitation). Ammonia {{is known to be}} toxic to aquatic species and has been listed as a toxic compound by Environment Canada. Enpar Technologies Inc. has developed a novel patented ion-exchange/electrochemical technology, the AmmEl System, to treat ammonia in wastewater streams. The AmmEl System uses a two-stage approach to treat ammonia; the first stage utilizes ion-exchange to remove ammonia from the wastewater followed by electrochemical oxidation of the captured ammonia directly to N 2 gas. The AmmEl system has been pilot tested at the City of Guelph wastewater treatment plant. Two separate wastewater streams were tested; Case (I) as a pre-treatment system for a high strength wastewater stream (700 mg/L NH 3 -N) and Case (II) to treat a low strength effluent stream (5 mg/L NH 3 -N). In the Case I test, the AmmEl system was able to remove greater than 93 % of the ammonia from the wastewater. In Case II, the AmmEl system was effective at removing the ammonia-N from the wastewater stream to less than the 1 mg/L target level, producing an average concentration of 0. 6 mg/L in the treated effluent. The AmmEl system has been proven to be an effective method for removing ammonia from a variety of waste streams and is applicable for the treatment ammonia in mine/mill effluent. The system is a robust and cost effective alternative to existing ammonia removal technologies...|$|R
50|$|In 1880 or 1881, John Spencer found silver {{deposits}} {{near this}} location. Capt. (later Gen.) William R. Shafter, stationed at Fort Davis and he collaborated {{to establish the}} mining operation. This operation consisted of the Cibolo Creek Mill & Mining Co. and the Presidio Mining Co., {{both of which were}} consolidated as the Presidio Mining Co. The Mina Grande orebody was producing by 1883. The ore, 30 ounces of silver per ton, was treated in a 50-ton Pan amalgamation mill. Annual production from 1898 to 1913 was 20,000 tons. In 1913, a 200-ton <b>cyanide</b> <b>mill</b> was added. Annual production from 1913 to 1926 was 84,000 tons, with 10 ounces of silver per ton.|$|E
50|$|Miller's {{came to life}} as {{a result}} of the furor in Tonopah. In 1901 the Tonopah and Goldfield Railroad was {{constructed}} and by 1904 Miller's was founded as a station and watering stop along the rail line. The name of the town honors Charles R. Miller, a director of the railroad who was also once the Governor of Delaware. Miller also worked as vice president of the Tonopah Mining Company and played a key role in bringing that company's 100-stamp <b>cyanide</b> <b>mill</b> built in Miller's in 1906. In 1907 the railroad company constructed repair shops in Miller's and another large mill went up. By 1910 Miller's had a post office, a business district and a population of 274. A year later, in 1911, the railroad shops and mill had moved and the town began a slow decline. When the railroad went under in 1947 the town of Miller's followed suit and became a ghost town.|$|E
50|$|The Walker Ranch is a {{historic}} ranch in Boulder County, Colorado. The ranch was built by James A. Walker, who first settled in the Boulder area in 1865. Walker and his family initially lived in a log cabin on the ranch, which was built in 1865. In 1881, Walker and his family built {{and moved to a}} new ranch house. Walker engaged in a number of business ventures on the ranch and leased parts of the ranch to other businessmen, and the enterprises which took place on the ranch represent many of the region's industries at the time. Walker mainly raised cattle and milled lumber on the property, and an English firm mined gold using a cyanide mill; payments from the latter operation allowed Walker to eliminate his debt and purchase additional land for the ranch. Of the remaining historic buildings on the ranch, eleven are from Walker's homestead and his ranching operations, fourteen were part of Walker's sawmill operations, and fourteen are related to the <b>cyanide</b> <b>mill.</b> The ranch also includes five archaeological sites; three of these are remnants of aboriginal settlement in the area and two of these are Arapahoe sites, including a site Walker may have shared with the Arapahoe when he first came to the area.|$|E
50|$|In July 1936, the La Luz {{property}} was optioned by The Tonopah Mining Company of Nevada, {{in association with}} Ventures Limited. The option was exercised in July 1938 and a Canadian corporation, La Luz Mines Limited, was formed. The cost of purchase, equipment, and operation was in excess of $3,000,000; Tonopah's investment was $240,000 with 120,000 shares of stock or {{ten percent of the}} outstanding shares. Ventures Limited and its affiliate held the remainder of the stock. The chief executives of La Luz Mines Limited were also the chief executives and members {{of the board of directors}} of The Tonopah Mining Company of Nevada. Ventures Limited was a large stockholder of Tonopah; Thayer Lindsley held the position of president for both companies. At the La Luz Mines Limited property, active construction started in November 1938 on a <b>cyanide</b> <b>mill,</b> electric plant, machine and carpenter shops, limekiln and commissary, and river station. The mill began operations in August 1939, although no development work was done in the mine during the period. The mine was successful showing net profits in the mid and late 1940s. In 1952, The Tonopah Mining Company of Nevada sold 6,000 shares of La Luz Mines Limited stock reducing its amount of shares to 114,000.|$|E
5000|$|The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad {{ran through}} Flatiron, {{and the town}} was home to the Wasp No. 2 Mine, {{which was founded in}} the 1890s. This open-pit mine was known for its gold. The first few {{attempts}} to mine the area were slow until a new general manager, John Gray, took over direction. The mine was then able to employ the use of explosives to extend the mine and break up the ore. Usually, 5,000 to 6,000 tons of ore were broken up at a time using about [...] of powder. The ore was very low-grade but was found in large deposits. The ore was hauled from the site using the company railroad and was pushed through the <b>cyanide</b> <b>mill</b> using gravity. The gold ore sold for US$1.60 a ton, which was a huge accomplishment at the time. The Little Blue Mine to the north became just as successful for producing gold and flux. The main railroad was eventually extended to the mill; however, the grade was so steep that the cars had to be hauled up by a winch. Two separate railroad lines ran through the town. One began and ended in the town, while the other lead into the town. The finely-ground tailings were used as fill and ballast in the form of sand.|$|E
5000|$|In 1890, a {{group of}} Nebraska [...] "farmers" [...] bought the Mercur claim through an over optimistic promoter. They opened the mine {{and put in a}} basic {{amalgamation}} mill, a grand flop. Mercur ores were not workable with the ancient process. One of the Nebraska partners, Gilbert S. [...] "Gill" [...] Peyton, a former druggist, heard of the new but unperfected cyanide process and gave it a try. Fearful of losing his and his relatives investment, he solved the difficulties of the new method on the ores, and by December 1891 proved that the cyanide process worked - the first such successful operation in the United States. (The cyanide process has come to dominate western gold metallurgy.) As a result, Peyton and his brother-in-law, partner Hal Brown became rich, as did others of the Nebraska group, including company president John Dern, a Fremont, Nebraska grain dealer soon-to-be Salt Lake City business leader. (Brown's niece married Dern's son George, who became a manager of Mercur Con, a successful mining engineer, and Utah governor, 1925-1933; he then served as Secretary of War under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 1933-1936).The advent of the cyanide process started the gold rush all over again. Gold was extracted not only from newly mined ore, but from old tailings as well. Soon, there were enough people to build a new town on the old site, but the name of Lewiston was already taken by then. The citizens settled on the name Mercur, from the Nebraska company's name, which in turn came from the name of Pinedo's claim. [...] A branch railroad was built in the fall and winter of 1894. A dozen mining operations worked the area's ores with the largest being the Golden Gate Mining Company, which operated the largest <b>cyanide</b> <b>mill</b> in the U. S. in 1898-1902 (A young Daniel C. Jackling, of later Bingham Canyon fame, designed the structure which is visible in photos above the town). In 1902, Joseph DeLamar sold the Golden Gate operation to the Derns and partners, who formed the Mercur Consolidated. Gill Peyton and Hal Brown had sold out by then. Brown became a Utah banker and promoter of horse racing while Peyton began working mines across the country and in Mexico. He left Salt Lake City, where he sold his Greek revival mansion, Peyton Hall, now known as the McIntyre Mansion, and died in California in 1930, looking for a second Mercur mine bonanza.|$|E

40|$|Many gold-bearing ores in the Western United States {{also contain}} {{small amounts of}} mercury. The {{presence}} of mercury creates potential pollution and health hazards during several steps in gold processing. An investigation was undertaken by the Bureau of Mines to develop techniques for removing mercury from <b>cyanide</b> <b>mill</b> solutions by selective electrowinning to reduce the potential hazards. Sixty-five percent of the mercury was selectively electrowon from synthetic carbon strip solution at applied potentials of 1. 00 to 1. 50 V when using a mercury-coated platinum or copper plate cathode. Increasing the active surface area by using mercury-coated copper wool resulted in up to % pct of the mercury being electrowon from mill carbon strip solutions that contained 1. 9 to 20 ppm Hg, 20 to 345 ppm Au, and 0. 35 to 39. 5 ppm Ag. About 98 pct of the silver was electrowon with the mercury onto the mercury cathode. Gold extraction ranged between 0 and 20 pet. Results of the investigation showed that choice of cathode material was {{critical to the success}} of the process. Selectivity was not achieved using uncoated steel wool cathodes...|$|E
