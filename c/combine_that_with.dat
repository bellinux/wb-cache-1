2500|$|After {{the release}} of the lead single, [...] "Russian Roulette", Harmony was aware of the mixed {{reaction}} from fans who had heard the track. He assured fans that the song was not fully representative {{to the rest of the}} album, though it reflected Rihanna's growth as an artist. In an interview with Rap-Up, Tricky Stewart announced that he had collaborated with The-Dream on the project. He described the album as a whole as [...] "uptempo and edgy", stating that the album is different from her past works. In February 2010, Rihanna expressed a positive opinion on the album, but commented that her future work would be less intense. She asserted, [...] "I really like the bottom, the grime of it. But if I were to <b>combine</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> more energetic, up-tempo pop records, then I think that would be a happy marriage. And that's where we'll probably go next". When asked what the most important song to her was, she stated that she doesn't have one, however, [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] and [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] were cited as her favorites.|$|E
2500|$|Aguilera {{set about}} {{contacting}} collaborators {{on her own}} accord, {{at the behest of}} then-husband Jordan Bratman, without relying on the record label A [...] "Going into , I said, 'I'm a really big fan of yours, and I'm interested in stepping into your world and what you do,'" [...] Aguilera says. [...] "'I want to <b>combine</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> my sound, and let's see what happens.' I feel like I can do so much with my voice. I would be so bored sitting on a stool singing ballad after ballad just because I can." [...] Australian singer-songwriter Sia Furler and her collaborator Samuel Dixon worked with Aguilera on a number of tracks for the album. Aguilera told Billboard that she is a big fan of Furler and stated that she was thrilled when Furler said that she wanted to work with her as well. They recorded together in the studio in January 2009, and according to Furler's blog the duo wrote four songs together during the sessions. Members of British electronic band Ladytron, Daniel Hunt and Reuben Wu, went to Los Angeles to meet Aguilera in December 2008 after hearing that they were one of her favorite bands. During the meeting, Aguilera identified what kind of Ladytron songs she liked, with Hunt later saying, [...] "We were impressed because she had a real deep knowledge of our music – album tracks, not just the singles!". Ladytron said following about the sessions with the singer, [...] "We went in with no expectations; the whole thing was a massive surprise. But it was incredible. She was so musically talented, a vocalist who really knows her voice. The first takes sounded really amazing, and while we'd made demos, it was only when her voice was on them that it all came to life." [...] They finished the work with Aguilera in March 2009 and produced four or five tracks, but only three songs made the final cut. Two songs produced by Ladytron appeared on the deluxe edition of the album, [...] "Birds of Prey" [...] and [...] "Little Dreamer." [...] Meanwhile, the third track, [...] "Kimono Girl" [...] did not make the final cut, although it has been highly anticipated by fans. British duo Goldfrapp said in a January 2010 interview that they did not finish the studio session and did not know whether their songs would make the final cut.|$|E
2500|$|Bianca's rape {{was heavily}} debated; viewers who despised the storyline argued the rape as [...] "punishment" [...] for her sexuality, and as unnecessary; others {{felt that it}} realistically {{captured}} what gay women sometimes face from men who want to force themselves on lesbians. When GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) was asked by Metro Weekly why GLAAD sent out an action alert voicing their concern over the rape of Bianca, but two days later sent out another release which seemed to support how the storyline was told, Joan M. Garry, {{executive director of the}} organization, responded that they had [...] "some concerns" [...] about [...] and [...] "that the broader context of the [...] genre kind of needs to be taken into account." [...] Metro Weekly felt that this did not answer their question. They wanted to know why there was a sudden reversal in GLAAD's statement, specifically citing that GLAAD's second press release spoke of rape experience for lesbians and how men who rape lesbians not only engage in gender based acts of violence, but in acts of hate violence, and that this release was supportive of how Bianca's rape storyline was told, as opposed to GLAAD's first press release on the matter. Garry said she felt that their first press release concerning Bianca's rape was premature. Metro Weekly countered by asking what is the [...] "actual process" [...] GLAAD uses to select what to criticize, what raises their organization's red flags. [...] "There's a whole host of input we receive about things as we hear about them, as we see them in script form, as we see them in pilots," [...] Garry relayed. [...] "We have a strong team of program folks who represent different regions around the country, different communities. We get an awful lot of stuff that comes across the transom via our website raising concerns. And we did get quite a number of concerns coming over email, particularly about All My Children." [...] Garry continued, [...] "So it's basically community feedback, {{as well as some of}} our own observations and perceptions. <b>Combine</b> <b>that</b> <b>with</b> conversations that we have with folks that are actually producing the images and we really try to work our way through those different opinions and shape a position we think makes sense." ...|$|E

[...] "A 550,000 acre swamp in Florida has been valued at $25 million per year for its role in storing water and recharging the aquifer."
