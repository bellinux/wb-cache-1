5|$|On the July 3 SmackDown, Ziggler {{defeated}} Alex Riley {{to qualify}} for a spot in the World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank ladder match. On July 13, Ziggler, Zack Ryder and Justin Roberts were involved in a car accident in San Diego while driving from Comic-Con; none of them suffered severe injuries. Two days later at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, Ziggler won the Money in the Bank ladder match to guarantee him the opportunity to challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship at a time of his choosing within the next year. Later that night, Ziggler attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus after Alberto Del Rio attacked him after their match, but Del Rio stopped Ziggler from <b>cashing</b> <b>in.</b> <b>On</b> the following episode of SmackDown, Ziggler again attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus following a tag team match with Alberto Del Rio, but was laid out by Rey Mysterio and Sheamus before he could do so. During this time, Ziggler began a feud with Chris Jericho after claiming he had lost his touch, which resulted in Jericho attacking him on two occasions, and defeating him in a singles match at SummerSlam. The night after SummerSlam, Ziggler defeated Jericho in a rematch; as a result Ziggler retained his Money in the Bank contract and Jericho's WWE contract was terminated. Following this, Ziggler began feuding with Randy Orton on SmackDown four days later, after Orton hit him with an RKO when Ziggler tried to cash his Money in the Bank contract on a vulnerable Sheamus. The following week on SmackDown, Ziggler faced Orton in a match that was won by Orton, Ziggler defeated him in a rematch on Raw by pinning him while holding his tights. Ziggler faced Orton again at Night of Champions where he lost again, ending the feud. On November 18 at Survivor Series, Ziggler captained the traditional 5-on-5 elimination tag team match opposite Mick Foley and won the match by last pinning Orton, making him the sole survivor of the match.|$|E
25|$|In early 2010, Poundland's then-owners Advent International were {{planning}} on <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the resurgence in discount retailers by preparing {{to put the}} chain up for sale. The report came as figures showed that value retailers were seeing a business boom in the current economic climate, with Barclays Private Equity expressing an interest in a potential take-over of Poundland for about £200 million. On Tuesday 4 May 2010, {{it was announced that}} Poundland had been sold to US private equity firm Warburg Pincus for £200 million and was the subject of an Initial Public Offering in March 2014.|$|E
25|$|Bill Lair {{retired from}} the CIA as a GS-16, the civil service {{equivalent}} of a brigadier general. He was 53 years old, with two grown children in college. He had a ranch to retire to, near Waco, but no means of <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> his life experience except a return to Thailand. Refusing to trade on his old friendships overseas, he instead became a long haul trucker. His past Asian expertise would be called upon only once more, in 1992, when he was again asked about the chances of setting up a paramilitary network in Cambodia. He again deemed it impossible.|$|E
5|$|In later Money in the Bank events, John Cena, Randy Orton and Sheamus won Money in the Bank ladder {{matches in}} 2012, 2013 and 2015 respectively.

Orton <b>cashed</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Daniel Bryan and captured the WWE Championship. Sheamus <b>cashed</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Roman Reigns and captured the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.|$|R

25|$|Also in 1990, Enigma Records, {{already having}} sold its {{interest}} in the band to the Geffen label, illegally released and distributed Fall from Grace, an unauthorized bootleg live album featuring songs from their first two releases and recorded at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The album was released without any input from the band members with regard to its songs, contents, credits, concepts, or artwork. The band learned of its existence when they stumbled upon it in a record store in Tucson, Arizona, on the night prior to suffering a near-fatal auto accident. Enigma Records folded after the release, <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the sales. The album was picked up, manufactured and distributed by Capitol Records, also possibly illegally.|$|E
500|$|Hastert {{has been}} married to Jean Hastert (née Kahl) since 1973. They have two children, Ethan and Joshua. Hastert's older son, Joshua, was a {{lobbyist}} for the firm PodestaMattoon, representing clients ranging from Amgen, a biotech company, to Lockheed Martin, a defense contractor. This provoked criticism from Congress Watch: [...] "There definitely should be restrictions ... This is family members <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> connections ... is an ideal opportunity for special interest groups to exploit family relationships for personal gain." [...] Joshua rejoined {{that he does not}} lobby House Republican leaders.|$|E
500|$|As the {{controversy}} unfolded, the Wikipedia community began {{a review of}} Essjay's previous edits and some felt he had relied upon his fictional professorship to influence editorial consideration of edits he made. [...] "People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> his fake credentials to bolster his arguments", said Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator {{and founder of the}} Wikipedia community newspaper, the Signpost. [...] "Those will get looked at again." [...] For instance, Essjay had recommended sources such as Catholicism for Dummies, a book granted the nihil obstat and imprimatur by the Roman Catholic Church. Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur: [...] "This is a text I often require for my students, and I would hang my own Ph.D. on it's [...] credibility." [...] In another case (a discussion of the liturgical use of the psalms), he cited personal experience from [...] "the Abbey of Gethsemani, where I was a monk." ...|$|E

500|$|Pfeiffer's early acting {{appearances}} included television roles on Fantasy Island, Delta House and BAD Cats among others. She {{was one of}} {{the several}} candidates to audition as a replacement for Kate Jackson on the television series Charlie's Angels in 1979, although the part went to Shelley Hack. She had small roles in a few theatrical films, including Falling in Love Again (1980) with Susannah York, The Hollywood Knights (1980) opposite Tony Danza, and Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen (1981), none of which met with much critical or box office success. Pfeiffer later said of her early screen work: [...] "I needed to learn how to act... in the meantime, I was playing bimbos and <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> my looks." [...] She appeared in a television commercial for Lux soap, and took acting lessons at the Beverly Hills Playhouse, before appearing in three further television movies – Callie and Son (1981) with Lindsay Wagner, The Children Nobody Wanted (1981), and a 1981 TV movie remake of Splendor in the Grass.|$|E
500|$|While Carly Darlin of The Orange County Register {{found the}} record to be [...] "an {{energetic}} and fun restatement of the RHCP whiplash funk attitude", {{she believed that}} [...] "with {{the exception of the}} dreamy instrumental 'Pretty Little Ditty', it doesn't break any new ground." [...] She continued by saying that, if anything [...] "Mother's Milk is a slight step away from the party-funk grooves of the last two albums and a return to the band's punk-rock roots. They even reprise the cover of Jimi Hendrix's 'Fire', which they did as a B-side for their 'Fight Like A Brave' 12-inch two years ago." [...] Furthermore, Mark Jenkins of The Washington Post said [...] "the polite term for albums like 'Milk' is 'eclectic', but it really sounds as if the band is unraveling [...] Considering the circumstances, it's not especially surprising that the album seems to be looking for someone to give it directions." [...] However, Jenkins did believe Frusciante possessed [...] "solid metal chops and means to show them off." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau mocked the band's ability to promote empathy and found the guitar layering in Mother's Milk to have been done improperly: [...] "punks who loved Hendrix and P-Funk way way back, they're finally <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> their good taste, and though unbelievers dis their sincerity, execution's the problem. They didn't have the chops to bring it off then, and by pushing the guitar up front they sound even cruder now. But they're perfectly nice fellas, really—mention 'compassion' in the very first verse." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{reference}} to Diane's {{return to the}} soap in 2008 for Frank's funeral, Paul English from the Daily Record accused EastEnders of using actor Mike Reid's real death as [...] "an opportunity to reintroduce some popular old faces.

2500|$|In 1996, Garner's novel Strandloper was published. His {{collection}} of essays and public talks, The Voice That Thunders, contains much autobiographical material (including an account of his life with bipolar disorder), as well as critical reflection upon folklore and language, literature and education, the nature of myth and time. In The Voice That Thunders he reveals the commercial pressure placed upon him during the decade-long drought which preceded Strandloper to 'forsake [...] "literature", and become instead a [...] "popular" [...] writer, <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> my established name by producing sequels to, and making series of, the earlier books'. Garner feared that [...] "making series ... would render sterile the existing work, the life that produced it, and bring about my artistic and spiritual death" [...] and felt unable to comply.|$|E
2500|$|Edmund Curll (c. 1675 – 11 December 1747) was an English {{bookseller}} and publisher. [...] His {{name has}} become synonymous, through {{the attacks on}} him by Alexander Pope, with unscrupulous publication and publicity. [...] Curll rose from poverty to wealth through his publishing, and he did this by approaching book printing in a mercenary and unscrupulous manner. [...] By <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> scandals, publishing pornography, offering up patent medicine, using all publicity as good publicity, he managed a small empire of printing houses. [...] He would publish high and low quality writing alike, {{so long as it}} sold. [...] He was born in the West Country, and his late and incomplete recollections (in The Curliad) say that his father was a tradesman. He was an apprentice to a London bookseller in 1698 when he began his career.|$|E

2500|$|The group battled on into 1978 {{with the}} release of [...] "Figaro", which brought them back into vogue and became their third UK Number one single. Many critics argued however that this song was simply <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the success of [...] "Angelo", but {{although}} their titles are similar, there is little evidence to support this, as the two songs are very different. In May [...] "Beautiful Lover" [...] was released and another hit, reaching the UK top twenty, and spending three months in the charts. An album was released soon after, B for Brotherhood. The record company took no chances with this album, given the failure of their previous two, and so with a TV advertising campaign, the album entered the UK Charts, eventually peaking at Number eighteen - their most successful album so far.|$|E
2500|$|The Intercept wrote {{critically}} of the book's advice, {{including the}} recommendation by Trump and Kiyosaki {{to invest in}} multi-level marketing companies, asserting instead that these are harmful pyramid schemes. The Intercept contrasted assertions in the book with promises by Trump during his 2016 campaign for president, writing Trump's later views were contradictory with the work. San Antonio Express-News was critical of the contradictory advice imparted in the book, writing, [...] "Trump and Kiyosaki argued that because they were already rich, they {{had no need to}} make more money, all the while <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the very books that said so."
