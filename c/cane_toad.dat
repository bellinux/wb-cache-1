5|$|The <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} to many regions of the worldparticularly the Pacificfor the biological control of agricultural pests. These introductions have generally been well documented, and the <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> {{may be one of}} the most studied of any introduced species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> has poison glands, and the tadpoles {{are highly}} toxic to most animals if ingested. Because of its {{voracious}} appetite, the <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> {{has been introduced}} to many regions of the Pacific and the Caribbean islands {{as a method of}} agricultural pest control. The species derives its common name from its use against the cane beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum). The <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> is now considered a pest and an invasive species in many of its introduced regions; of particular concern is its toxic skin, which kills many animals, both wild and domesticated. Cane toads are particularly dangerous to dogs.|$|E
5|$|Bufotenin, {{one of the}} {{chemicals}} excreted by the <b>cane</b> <b>toad,</b> is classified as a class-1 drug under Australian law, alongside heroin and cannabis. The effects of bufotenin {{are thought to be}} similar to those of mild poisoning; the stimulation, which includes mild hallucinations, lasts for less than an hour. As the <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> excretes bufotenin in small amounts, and other toxins in relatively large quantities, toad licking could result in serious illness or death.|$|E
50|$|Rather than {{avoiding}} <b>cane</b> <b>toads,</b> some {{native species}} have learnt foraging techniques {{allowing them to}} exploit <b>cane</b> <b>toads</b> as a food source. This learnt behaviour has been observed in predators that are more resistant to the <b>cane</b> <b>toad’s</b> toxins including birds and rodents.|$|R

5|$|Most frogs {{identify}} prey by movement, {{and vision}} {{appears to be}} the primary method by which the <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> detects prey; however, the <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> can also locate food using its sense of smell. They eat a wide range of material; in addition to the normal prey of small rodents, reptiles, other amphibians, birds, and even bats and a range of invertebrates, they also eat plants, dog food, and household refuse.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> is {{native to}} the Americas, and its range {{stretches}} from the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas to the central Amazon and southeastern Peru, {{and some of the}} continental islands near Venezuela (such as Trinidad and Tobago). This area encompasses both tropical and semiarid environments. The density of the <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> is significantly lower within its native distribution than in places where it has been introduced. In South America, the density was recorded to be 20 adults per 100m (109yd) of shoreline, 1 to 2% of the density in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} 1840s, the <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> had been {{introduced}} into Martinique and Barbados, from French Guiana and Guyana. An introduction to Jamaica was made in 1844 {{in an attempt to}} reduce the rat population. Despite its failure to control the rodents, the <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> was introduced to Puerto Rico in the early 20th century in the hope that it would counter a beetle infestation ravaging the sugarcane plantations. The Puerto Rican scheme was successful and halted the economic damage caused by the beetles, prompting scientists in the 1930s to promote it as an ideal solution to agricultural pests.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} the aversion {{learning}} capabilities of planigales with regards to avoiding <b>cane</b> <b>toads</b> as prey, upon initial contact with the toxic species. In the longer term, planigale populations exposed to <b>cane</b> <b>toads</b> over many generations {{have been able to}} physiologically adapt to the presence of <b>cane</b> <b>toads,</b> exhibiting a higher tolerance to the toad’s toxins.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cane</b> <b>Toads</b> (Rhinella marina; {{hereafter}} 2 ̆ 7 toads 2 ̆ 7) are large, toxic American anurans {{that were}} introduced to Australia in 1935. Research on their ecological impact has focussed on the lethal ingestion of toxic toads by native frog-eating predators. Less {{attention has been paid}} to the potential impacts of <b>Cane</b> <b>Toads</b> as predators, although these large anurans sometimes eat vertebrates, such as nestling birds and bird eggs. We review published and unpublished data on interactions between <b>Cane</b> <b>Toads</b> and Australian ground-nesting birds, and collate distributional and breeding information to identify the avian taxa potentially at risk of having eggs or chicks eaten by <b>Cane</b> <b>Toads.</b> <b>Cane</b> <b>Toads</b> are currently sympatric with 80 ground-nesting bird species in Australia, and five additional species of bird occur within the predicted future range of the toad. Although many species of bird are potentially at risk, available data suggest there is minimal impact of <b>Cane</b> <b>Toads</b> on ground-nesting species. Future research could usefully address both direct and indirect impacts of the invasion by <b>Cane</b> <b>Toads,</b> ideally with detailed field observations of these impacts on nesting success and of changes in bird breeding success as a function of invasion by toads...|$|R
50|$|In particular, native Australian frog {{species have}} been found to avoid the urine scent of adult <b>cane</b> <b>toads.</b> This {{behaviour}} is hypothesised to reduce the rate of potentially dangerous encounters with large toads. However, similar avoidance behaviour in frogs naïve to <b>cane</b> <b>toads</b> at the toad invasion front, suggests that frogs may simply seek shelter sites free of unfamiliar scents, rather than learning to directly avoid <b>cane</b> <b>toads</b> from olfactory cues.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to releasing toxin, the <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> {{is capable of}} inflating its lungs, puffing up, and lifting its body off the ground to appear taller and larger to a potential predator.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> {{closely resembles}} many bufonid species. In particular, {{it could be}} {{confused}} with the southern toad (Bufo terrestris), which can be distinguished by the presence of two bulbs in front of the parotoid glands.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{are able}} to kill {{poisonous}} cane toads, an introduced pest, as the toxins exuded by toad, that usually kill the cane toad's predators, do not affect the meat ants. Due to this, scientists in Australia have considered using meat ants {{as a form of}} pest control to reduce the <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> population. One way of doing this is by establishing meat ant nests in habitats where <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> numbers are high. In rural Australia, meat ants are important to farmers, who place animal carcasses on ant nests to get rid of them. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass is consumed and reduced to bones. Due to the meat ants aggression, workers will pour out of entrance holes to attack if a human or animal disturbs their nest.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cane</b> <b>toads</b> are a toxic anuran, {{native to}} South and Central America. In Australia, <b>cane</b> <b>toads</b> are an {{invasive}} species and {{pose a threat}} to the population viability of native anurophagous Australian predators and scavengers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cane</b> <b>toads</b> {{have entered}} {{the upper reaches of}} the Darling Basin and there are several reports of {{individuals}} being found further down the system. <b>Cane</b> <b>toads</b> compete with native amphibians and are toxic to native carnivores.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cane</b> <b>toads</b> (Bufo marinus) {{are also}} known to become lost frogs, however they can usually adapt to change, and {{often do not}} die once they reach their destination. The {{movement}} of <b>cane</b> <b>toads</b> in building material {{is one of the}} causes for the spread of the species around Australia. Populations of <b>cane</b> <b>toads</b> ahead of their main frontier, such as the former population at Port Macquarie, are believed to be displaced toads moved from areas in Queensland.|$|R
5|$|The <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> {{naturally}} {{exists in}} South Texas, but attempts (both deliberate and accidental) {{have been made}} to introduce the species {{to other parts of the}} country. These include introductions to Florida and to the islands of Hawaii, as well as largely unsuccessful introductions to Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{apparent}} {{success of the}} <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> in eating the beetles threatening the sugarcane plantations of Puerto Rico, and the fruitful introductions into Hawaii and the Philippines, a strong push was made for the <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> {{to be released in}} Australia to negate the pests ravaging the Queensland cane fields. As a result, 102 toads were collected from Hawaii and brought to Australia. After an initial release in August 1935, the Commonwealth Department of Health decided to ban future introductions until a study was conducted into the feeding habits of the toad. The study was completed in 1936 and the ban lifted, when large-scale releases were undertaken; by March 1937, 62,000 toadlets had been released into the wild. The toads became firmly established in Queensland, increasing exponentially in number and extending their range into the Northern Territory and New South Wales. In 2010, one was found on the far western coast in Broome, Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Tadpoles {{are highly}} {{vulnerable}} to being eaten by fish, newts, predatory diving beetles, and birds, such as kingfishers. Some tadpoles, {{including those of}} the <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> (Bufo marinus), are poisonous. The tadpole stage may be as short as a week in explosive breeders or it may last through one or more winters followed by metamorphosis in the spring.|$|E

50|$|In {{the video}} game Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue, <b>cane</b> <b>toads</b> appear as enemies.

5000|$|Lewis' <b>Cane</b> <b>Toads</b> {{has several}} {{additional}} revolutionary elements. Bousé [...] suggests that nature {{has become a}} resource for art and entertainment today. Mitman [...] denounces films that exploit nature {{and make it a}} spectacle, ignoring the inevitable nature-human relationship. However, Lewis succeeds in creating a film that acknowledges this interaction and important relationship. <b>Cane</b> <b>Toads</b> is a reversal of the man vs nature relationship that characterizes most wildlife films. It is a study of human nature through the eyes of <b>cane</b> <b>toads.</b> Humans become the source of entertainment.|$|R
5|$|The <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> {{is an old}} species. A fossil toad (specimen UCMP 41159) {{from the}} La Venta fauna of the late Miocene of Colombia is indistinguishable from modern cane toads from {{northern}} South America. It was discovered in a floodplain deposit, which suggests the R. marina habitat preferences have long been for open areas.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> was {{introduced}} to various Caribbean islands to counter a number of pests infesting local crops. While {{it was able to}} establish itself on some islands, such as Barbados, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico, other introductions, such as in Cuba before 1900 and in 1946, and on the islands of Dominica and Grand Cayman, were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The skin of {{the adult}} <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> is toxic, {{as well as the}} {{enlarged}} parotoid glands behind the eyes, and other glands across their backs. When the toads are threatened, their glands secrete a milky-white fluid known as bufotoxin. Components of bufotoxin are toxic to many animals; even human deaths have been recorded due to the consumption of cane toads.|$|E

50|$|A {{study to}} be {{published}} in the Ecology journal states that the invasion of <b>cane</b> <b>toads</b> in a case study area caused a trophic cascade over a period of five years. The resident predators, the monitor lizards, ate the <b>cane</b> <b>toads</b> and died, which resulted in a boom in the population of the lizards' typical prey, the crimson finches.|$|R
5|$|As a result, many {{countries}} in the Pacific region emulated the lead of Puerto Rico and introduced the toad in the 1930s. There are introduced populations in Australia, Florida, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Ogasawara, Ishigaki Island and the Daitō Islands of Japan, most Caribbean islands, Fiji and many other Pacific islands, including Hawaii. Since then, the <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> has become a pest in many host countries, and poses {{a serious threat to}} native animals.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> was {{introduced}} into New Guinea {{to control the}} hawk moth larvae eating sweet potato crops. The first release occurred in 1937 using toads imported from Hawaii, with a second release the same year using specimens from the Australian mainland. Evidence suggests a third release in 1938, consisting of toads being used for human pregnancy testsmany species of toad {{were found to be}} effective for this task, and were employed for about 20years after the discovery was announced in 1948. Initial reports argued the toads were effective in reducing the levels of cutworms and sweet potato yields were thought to be improving. As a result, these first releases were followed by further distributions across much of the region, although their effectiveness on other crops, such as cabbages, has been questioned; when the toads were released at Wau, the cabbages provided insufficient shelter and the toads rapidly left the immediate area for the superior shelter offered by the forest. A similar situation had previously arisen in the Australian cane fields, but this experience was either unknown or ignored in New Guinea. The <b>cane</b> <b>toad</b> has since become abundant in rural and urban areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} quoll (D. hallucatus) {{could be}} found in the northern third of Australia a century ago. Presently, it resides in high rocky areas and areas with heavy rainfall. It is abundant on the minor islands surrounding northern Australia. In 2003, northern quolls were translocated to Astell and Pobassoo Islands to isolate them from the toxic invasive <b>cane</b> <b>toad.</b> Genetic analysis indicates it is the earliest offshoot from the ancestors of other quolls.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cane</b> <b>toads</b> were {{introduced}} into northern Queensland between 1935 and 1937. The population rapidly expanded and the species spread westwards at an initial rate of approximately 15 km per year.
