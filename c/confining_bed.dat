40|$|We have {{developed}} a Miocene sequence stratigraphic framework using data from recently drilled boreholes in the New Jersey Coastal Plain. Sequences are shallowing upward, unconformity-bounded units; fine-grained shelf and prodelta sediments grade upward to delta front and shallow-marine sands, corresponding to confining bed-aquifer couplets. By dating Miocene sequences using Sr-isotope stratigraphy, and mapping with borehole data and geophysical logs, we can predict the continuity and effectiveness of the confining beds and aquifers. The following are illustrated on a 904 ~ 11 basinward dip section: (1) the composite <b>confining</b> <b>bed</b> is comprised of the KwO and lower Kwla (ca. 23. 8 - 20. 5 Ma) sequences downdip at Atlantic City, and the Kw 1 b, Kw 1 a and older sequences updip (ca. 69. 3 - 20. 6 Ma), and is continuous {{throughout most of the}} coastal plain; (2) the major confined aquifer, the Atlantic City 800 -foot sand, is comprised of the upper Kwla and Kwlb sequences (ca. 20520. 2 Ma) and is an areally continuous sand that is interconnected with the Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer system updip of Mays Landing; (3) the <b>confining</b> <b>bed</b> above the Atlantic City 800 -foot sand is comprised of the Kw 2 a, Kw 2 b, and Kw 3 sequences (18. 1 - 13. 3 Ma) and is an extensive <b>confining</b> <b>bed</b> that pinches out updip. These sequences and aquifer-confining bed couplets are linked to global sea-level changes evinced by the S”O record. We conclude that sequence stratigraphy is a powerful tool when applied to regional hydrogeologic problems, although basinal tectonic differences and localized variations in sediment supply can affect aquifer thickness and permeability...|$|E

40|$|As human {{population}} increases, demand for water supplies will cause {{an increase in}} pumping rates from confined aquifers which may become unconfined after long-term pumping. Such an unconfined-confined conversion problem has not been fully investigated before and {{is the focus of}} this thesis. The objective of this thesis is to use both analytical and numerical modeling to investigate groundwater flow in an unconfined-confined aquifer including the no-flow lateral boundary effect and the regional flow influence. This study has used Girinskii?s Potential in combination with MATLAB to depict how changes in aquifer dimensions, hydraulic properties, regional flow rates, and pumping rates affect {{the size and shape of}} the unconfined-confined boundary. This study finds that the unconfined-confined conversion is quite sensitive to the distance between the piezometric surface and the upper <b>confining</b> <b>bed</b> when that distance is small, and the sensitivity lessens as that distance increases. The study shows that pumping rate is the dominating factor for controlling the size of the unconfined-confined boundary in comparison to the regional flow. It also shows that the presence of a no-flow boundary alters the normally elliptical shape of the unconfined-confined boundary...|$|E
40|$|Dewatering of a {{borrow pit}} in Portsmouth, VA, induced {{localized}} saltwater intrusion into a sandy coastal aquifer during excavation of the surficial deposit. More {{than a decade}} after mining operations ceased, brackish water still contaminates residential wells and the pit lake despite the expectation that recharge would lower the salinity of the wells and the lake over time. Twenty-seven Schlumberger resis-tivity soundings and two Wenner profiles were taken around the lake and salinity measurements of surface and well water were collected at 27 locations in order to delineate the extent of brackish groundwater in the surficial aquifer. Interpretation of these data, when combined with information from prior limnological and geological studies, indicates {{the presence of a}} relatively saline, confined aquifer beneath the lake. This aquifer is connected to the lake only where a deep depression on the lake bottom penetrates through the <b>confining</b> <b>bed</b> overlying the aquifer. The only continuous source of chloride for the lake is brackish water in that depression. Fresh groundwater in the shallow aquifer becomes brackish as it passes through the lake, eventually reentering the aquifer, where it contaminates the residential wells...|$|E
40|$|The {{average annual}} {{rainfall}} in the Manasota Basin is 53. 7 inches, and annual evapo-transpiration is about 39 inches. Annual runoff from gaged {{parts of the}} Basin ranges from about 13 to 17 inches per year.

Generally, surface water is of good quality except in tidally affected, coastal areas Its quality varies seasonally, generally becoming more mineralized during the dry season.

40|$|The Green River-Moab area {{encompasses}} about 7, 800 {{square kilometers}} or about 25 {{percent of the}} Paradox basin.

The upper Mesozoic sandstone aquifer, probably is the most permeable hydrogeologic unit of the area and is the subject of this investigation. The principal component of groundwater outflow from this aquifer probably is subsurface flow to regional streams (the Green and Colorado Rivers) and is about 100 million cubic meters per year.

40|$|Problem statement: The risk of {{groundwater}} pollution and preservation {{of groundwater}} quality of these resources are extremely important topics, particularly {{at the present time}} in which water is becoming a limitative factor for land development. In this context the main objective of this study was the evaluation of the pollution vulnerability of groundwater in the Ivrea Morainic Amphitheatre (IMA), situated in the North-West of Piemonte. Approach: The case study required the application of the combined approach SINTACS and GNDCI-CNR Basic Method. SINTACS, used only for the evaluation of vulnerability in the plain covered by alluvial materials, was not considered for the hilly area due to lack of sufficient data, necessary to assign values to the seven required SINTACS parameters. Instead the GNDCI-CNR Basic Method was used, based on a survey of hydrogeologic complexes. The hydrogeologic study had identified an unconfined aquifer in the plain area, situated in the fluvial permeable sediments. Moreover the study had identified a <b>confining</b> <b>bed</b> which separates the aquifer from a deep confined aquifer. Analysis of water table aquifer flow patterns and groundwater quality had led to the characterization of some relationships between different aquifers. Results: Vulnerability map showed an important difference between the water table aquifer and the glacial tills aquifers. The first one had a very high vulnerability, due especially to the small depth of middle-high permeable sediments in the water table. The second one, on the contrary, had a low degree of vulnerability. Conclusion: The vulnerability map must be a fundamental component of an overall groundwater protection scheme: Springs in moraines and the confined aquifer in the plain, which was not affected by groundwater contamination, had better characteristics for drinking water designations. </font...|$|E
40|$|Geopressured {{reservoirs}} contain {{three types}} of energy: thermal, hydraulic, and methane gas. The thermal energy generally {{is a function of}} depth of burial. It can be converted to electricity using the binary or flash power plant cycle, the flash technology being commercial only if the fluid temperature exceeds about 340 F. The hydraulic energy can be converted to electrical power using a hydraulic turbine. The dissolved gas can be separated and either used to produce electricity using a gas turbine or sold commercially. These reservoirs occur in many states in the USA, including California. An overburden pressure is caused by the combined weight of the formation rock and the fluids (water/gas/oil) present in the pore spaces overlying the formation of interest. The overburden pressure, in general, increases relatively uniformly with depth, whereas the hydrostatic gradient is mainly a function of two variables: the dissolved solids concentration and the temperature gradient. The hydrostatic pressure gradient for fresh water is 0. 433 psi/ft. Geopressured reservoirs are overpressured; that is, the fluid pressure in the reservoir exceeds the pressure corresponding to the local hydrostatic pressure gradient. (Fig. 3) <b>Confining</b> <b>bed</b> or cap rock is necessary in order for a formation to be geopressured. Otherwise, the pressure would equalize to hydrostatic through upward flow. The pressures in a geopressured reservoir may approach the overburden pressure of about 1 psi/ft. Gulf Coast geopressured reservoirs typically exist between 12, 000 to 20, 000 feet below the surface. Flow rates of between 10, 000 to 40, 000 barrels per day, temperatures from 270 to 500 F, bottom hole pressures from 12, 000 to 18, 500 pounds psi, salinities of 20, 000 to 200, 000 milligrams per liter, and gas contents of 23 to 100 standard cubic feet per barrel, have been reported from geopressured wells...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring {{wells and}} {{groundwater}} sensors were installed and monitored {{in and around}} Holts Landing State Park on the Indian River Bay, eastern Sussex County, Delaware, between October 2009 and August 2012. Data from test drilling, geophysical logging, geophysical surveys, and well testing characterized the hydrogeological framework and spatial and temporal patterns of water pressure, temperature, and salinity in the shallow, unconfined Columbia aquifer. The work revealed a plume of freshened groundwater extending more than 650 ft into the bay from the shoreline. Groundwater salinities intermediate between baywater and inland groundwater are present both offshore and on land adjacent to the bay and tidal tributaries. The fresh groundwater plume, as observed in wells and borehole geophysical logs, decreases in thickness from more than 40 ft nearest the shoreline to less than 20 ft farthest from the shoreline. Saline water is found {{above and below the}} plume and the freshwater-saltwater interface is spatially complex. Characterization of the hydrogeologic framework was critical to explaining the distribution of fresh groundwater. Fresh water is trapped near the bay bottom by an overlying <b>confining</b> <b>bed</b> composed of the low permeability sediments of a Holocene paleovalley fill sequence and the Beaverdam Formation. This complex, heterogeneous geological framework also causes multiple stacked interfaces in one location at the study site. Groundwater levels, temperatures, and specific conductivity respond to climatic, seasonal, and storm-related weather forcing patterns as well as to forces caused by astronomical tides. The relative importance of these forces to groundwater levels, the flux of fresh groundwater, and groundwater salinity varies with location. Ranges in groundwater levels are more than 6 ft at an inland location and are clearly controlled by seasonal recharge patterns. Extreme weather events have a secondary effect on groundwater levels. In comparison, ranges of groundwater levels are much smaller in near shore and offshore wells, and are more closely related to tidal forces. As a result of this difference in ranges of groundwater levels, seasonal variations in water levels at inland locations are the primary variable controlling bayward-directed groundwater gradients, fresh groundwater flux, and groundwater salinity distribution. Shorter duration weather and tidal events have a secondary role. The freshwater-saltwater interface and associated mixing zone moves upward and/or landward during extended periods of low freshwater flux into the bay, and downward and/or bayward during extended periods of higher freshwater flux...|$|E
