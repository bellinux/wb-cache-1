This is very close to the corresponding absorption peak of the protein at 397 nm. Together with previous data obtained with an anionic GFP model chromophore, the present data show that the absorption of GFP is primarily determined by intrinsic chromophore properties.

Flavin mononucleotide (FMN) is a <b>chromophore</b> <b>molecule</b> in the two LOV domains (LOV 1 and LOV 2), but only LOV 2 is responsible for kinase activation. Previous studies reported an important role of an additional helix connected to the C-terminal of LOV 2 (Jα helix) for the function of phototropin; however, it remains unclear how the Jα helix affects light-induced structural changes in LOV 2. In this study we compared light-induced protein structural changes of the LOV 2 domain of Arabidopsis phot 1 in the absence (LOV 2 -core) and presence (LOV 2 -Jα) of the Jα helix by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Prominent peaks were observed only in the amide-I region (1650 (−) / 1625 (+) cm− 1) of LOV 2 -Jα at physiological temperatures (≥ 260 K), corresponding to structural perturbation of the α-helix. The peaks were diminished by point mutation of functionally important amino acids such as Phe- 556 between FMN and the β-sheet, Gln- 575 being hydrogen-bonded with FMN, and Ile- 608 on the Jα helix.

Chlorophyll constitutes the key <b>chromophore</b> <b>molecule</b> in light harvesting complexes. It is well-known that the surrounding protein in the light harvesting complex fine-tunes chlorophyll electronic transitions to optimize energy transfer. Therefore, {{an understanding of the}} influence of the environment on the monomeric chlorophyll electronic transitions is important. The Q-band 2 DES is inhomogeneous at early times, particularly in hydrogen bonding polar solvents, but also in nonpolar solvents like cyclohexane. Interestingly this inhomogeneity persists for long times, even up to the nanosecond time scale in some solvents. The reshaping of the 2 DES occurs over multiple time scales and was assigned mainly to spectral diffusion. At early times the reshaping is Gaussian-like, hinting at a strong solvent reorganization effect. The temporal evolution of the 2 DES response was analyzed in terms of a Brownian oscillator model. The spectral densities underpinning the Brownian oscillator fitting were recovered for the different solvents. The absorption spectra and Stokes shift were also properly described by this model. The extent and nature of inhomogeneous broadening was a strong function of solvent, being larger in H-bonding and viscous media and smaller in nonpolar solvents.

The depletion spectrum of OCS in pure " 4 He droplets was comprehensively studied. The rovibrational OCS spectrum shows well resolved narrow lines. The spectrum is shifted to the red relative to the corresponding gas phase spectrum and the rotational constant of OCS in " 4 He droplet is three times smaller than that for free molecule. Different models of OCS rotation in the helium environment were discussed. It was shown that the shapes of the rovibrational lines are defined mainly by inhomogeneous broadening due to the droplet size distribution. The sub-rotational structure of the OCS rovibrational lines was revealed in microwave-infrared double resonance experiments.
