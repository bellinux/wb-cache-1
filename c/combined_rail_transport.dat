Many traits of this service are innovative, {{at least in the}} Mediterranean. To mention but a few: the geographical area it connects,the rapid geo-political evolution, the independent managingof the maritime route by a cons 01 tium of road transport companies, the use of <b>combined</b> road/ <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> to reachthe European market, the air transfer of drivers, the transformationto the structure of the companies, etc. This service offersindeed a valuable example- not only because of its supeliorlogisticalefficiency compared to the road or container ship options-for the future of transport between Europe (in particularcentral- eastern European count 1 ies) and the new markets inthe Levant, located behind the Eastern Mediterranean shores...|$|R

Due {{to the importance of}} transport logistics hubs the, at least, most relevant ones should be integrated in the models.

Particular attention is paid to the market for <b>Combined</b> Road <b>rail</b> <b>Transport,</b> both as accompanied and as non accompanied transport. These two sector are examined in an effort to detect the obstacles that are still preventing the expansion in Eastern and Central Europe of non accompanied transport techniques, now a minor phenomenon elsewhere. The analysis of the present outlook and the identification of current problems are followed by the initial steps that national governments and railway companies in these countries should make in order to upgrade transport to and from these areas. Lastly, reference is aimed to the action undertaken by national governments and transport companies of the three Western European countries having the largest share of intermodal connections with Eastern and Central Europe (Austria, Germany and Italy), particularly with reference to the Italian company CEMAT...|$|R
