25|$|National Economic Security and Recovery Act (NESARA) {{was a set}} of {{proposed}} economic reforms suggested during the 1990s by Harvey Francis Barnard.

The proposals were never introduced before Congress.|$|E

25|$|In finance, in {{particular}} the Black–Scholes model, changes in the logarithm of exchange rates, price indices, and stock market indices are assumed normal (these variables behave like <b>compound</b> <b>interest,</b> not like simple interest, and so are multiplicative). Some mathematicians such as Benoit Mandelbrot have argued that log-Levy distributions, which possesses heavy tails {{would be a more}} appropriate model, {{in particular}} for the analysis for stock market crashes. The use of the assumption of normal distribution occurring in financial models has also been criticized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his works.|$|E

25|$|City Bank of New York was {{chartered}} by New York State on June 16, 1812, with $2million of capital. Serving a {{group of}} New York merchants, the bank opened for business on September 14 of that year, and Samuel Osgood was elected as the first President of the company. The company's name was changed to The National City Bank of New York in 1865 after it joined the new U.S. national banking system, and it became the largest American bank by 1895. It became the first contributor to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1913, and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a U.S. bank in Buenos Aires, although the bank had, since the mid-19th century, been active in plantation economies, such as the Cuban sugar industry. The 1918 purchase of U.S. overseas bank International Banking Corporation helped it become the first American bank to surpass $1 billion in assets, and it became the largest commercial bank {{in the world in}} 1929. As it grew, the bank became a leading innovator in financial services, becoming the first major U.S. bank to offer <b>compound</b> <b>interest</b> on savings (1921); unsecured personal loans (1928); customer checking accounts (1936) and the negotiable certificate of deposit (1961).|$|E

25|$|Italy has {{class action}} legislation. Consumer {{associations}} can file claims {{on behalf of}} groups of consumers to obtain judicial orders against corporations that cause injury or damage to consumers. These types of claims are increasing and Italian courts have recently allowed them against banks that continue to apply <b>compound</b> <b>interest</b> on retail clients’ current account overdrafts. The introduction of class actions is on the new government’s agenda. On November 19, 2007, the Senato della Repubblica passed a class action law in Finanziaria 2008, a financial document for the economy management of the government. Now (from 10 December 2007), in order of Italian legislation system, the law is before the House {{and has to be}} passed also by the Camera dei Deputati, the second house of Italian Parliament, to become an effective law. In 2004, the Italian parliament considered the introduction of a type of class action, specifically in the area of consumers’ law. To date, no such law has been enacted, but scholars demonstrated that class actions (azioni rappresentative) do not contrast with Italian principles of civil procedure. Class action is regulated by art. 140 bis of the Italian consumers' code and will be in force from 1 July 2009.|$|E

500|$|During the 17th century, a more {{scientific}} basis for risk management was being developed.

500|$|During his Senate campaign, Butler {{spoke out}} forcefully about the {{veterans}} bonus. Veterans of World War I, {{many of whom}} had been out of work {{since the beginning of the}} Great Depression, sought immediate cash payment of Service Certificates granted to them eight years earlier via the World War Adjusted Compensation Act of 1924. Each Service Certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier's promised payment, plus <b>compound</b> <b>interest.</b> The problem was that the certificates (like bonds), matured 20 years from the date of original issuance, thus, under extant law, the Service Certificates could not be redeemed until 1945. In June 1932, approximately 43,000 marchers—17,000 of whom were World War I veterans, their families, and affiliated groups—protested in Washington, D.C. The Bonus Expeditionary Force, also known as the [...] "Bonus Army", marched on Washington to advocate the passage of the [...] "soldier's bonus" [...] for service during World War I. After Congress adjourned, bonus marchers remained in the city and became unruly. On July 28, 1932, two bonus marchers were shot by police, causing the entire mob to become hostile and riotous. The FBI, then known as the United States Bureau of Investigation, checked its fingerprint records to obtain the police records of individuals who had been arrested during the riots or who had participated in the bonus march.|$|E
