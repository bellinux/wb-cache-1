5|$|Monomethylhydrazine, {{as well as}} its {{precursors}} methylformylhydrazine and gyromitrin and raw Gyromitra esculenta, {{have been}} shown to be <b>carcinogenic</b> in experimental animals. Although Gyromitra esculenta has not been observed to cause cancer in humans, it is possible there is a <b>carcinogenic</b> risk for people who ingest these types of mushrooms. The toxins may be cumulative and even small amounts may have a <b>carcinogenic</b> effect. At least 11 different hydrazines have been isolated from Gyromitra esculenta, and it is not known if the potential carcinogens can be completely removed by parboiling.|$|E
5|$|While {{chromium}} metal and Cr(III) ions {{are not considered}} toxic, hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is toxic and <b>carcinogenic.</b> Abandoned chromium production sites often require environmental cleanup.|$|E
5|$|A 1998 {{study using}} rats {{found that the}} biopersistence of {{synthetic}} fibers after one year was 0.04–10%, but 27% for amosite asbestos. Fibers that persisted longer {{were found to be}} more <b>carcinogenic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Barium is not <b>carcinogenic</b> and it {{does not}} bioaccumulate. Inhaled dust {{containing}} insoluble barium compounds can accumulate in the lungs, causing a benign condition called baritosis. The insoluble sulfate is nontoxic and is not classified as a dangerous goods in transport regulations.|$|E
5|$|Paxillus involutus also {{contains}} agents which appear to damage chromosomes; {{it is unclear}} whether these have <b>carcinogenic</b> or mutagenic potential. Two compounds that have been identified are the phenols involutone and involutin; the latter is responsible for the brownish discolouration upon bruising.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{tests on}} {{reproductive}} function, embryonic toxicity, or <b>carcinogenic</b> potential {{can all be}} required by law, depending on the result of other studies {{and the type of}} drug being tested.|$|E
5|$|The {{oil shale}} waste heaps pose a {{spontaneous}} ignition risk {{due to their}} remaining organic content. The waste material, particularly semi-coke, contains pollutants including sulphates, heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), {{some of which are}} toxic and <b>carcinogenic.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is also direct {{epidemiological}} {{evidence that}} TCDD is not <b>carcinogenic</b> at low doses, {{and in some}} studies cancer risk has even decreased. This is called a J-shape dose-response, low doses decrease the risk, and only higher doses increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is toxic, an {{oxidizing}} agent, and is categorised as probably <b>carcinogenic</b> {{to humans}} by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Consequently, {{it must be}} handled and stored with the appropriate safety precautions to prevent inhalation, ingestion and skin contact. Due to its hazardous nature, the limited applications of lead(II) nitrate are under constant scrutiny.|$|E
5|$|Occupational {{chemical}} {{exposure to}} benzene and other aromatic organic solvents is controversial {{as a cause}} of AML. Benzene and many of its derivatives are known to be <b>carcinogenic</b> in vitro. While some studies have suggested a link between occupational exposure to benzene and increased risk of AML, others have suggested the attributable risk, if any, is slight.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is a metal {{with low}} toxicity. It is poorly absorbed by human body when digested. Plants {{such as the}} water {{hyacinth}} are killed by low levels of palladium salts, but most other plants tolerate it, although tests show that, at levels above 0.0003%, growth is affected. High doses of palladium could be poisonous; tests on rodents suggest it may be <b>carcinogenic,</b> though no clear evidence indicates the element harms humans.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium and {{tellurium}} compounds {{are considered}} to be mildly toxic and need to be handled with care, although acute poisoning is rare. Tellurium poisoning is particularly difficult to treat as many chelation agents used in the treatment of metal poisoning will increase the toxicity of tellurium. Tellurium is not reported to be <b>carcinogenic.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} that vanadium or vanadium compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens. Vanadium pentoxide was reported to be <b>carcinogenic</b> in male rats and in male and female mice by inhalation in an NTP study, although the interpretation of the results has recently been disputed. The carcinogenicity of vanadium has not been determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
5|$|These {{polycyclic}} hydrocarbons also {{activate the}} AH receptor, {{but less than}} TCDD and only temporarily. Even many natural compounds present in vegetables cause some activation of the AH receptor. This phenomenon {{can be viewed as}} adaptive and beneficial, because it protects the organism from toxic and <b>carcinogenic</b> substances. Excessive and persistent stimulation of AH receptor, however, leads to a multitude of adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|This fungus is inedible, as it {{contains}} the toxic compound gyromitrin, which when digested is metabolized into monomethylhydrazine, {{a major component}} of rocket fuel. Although much of the gyromitrin may be removed by parboiling with generous volumes of water, consumption is not advisable due to possible long-term health effects—there is evidence that even small doses of gyromitrin may have a cumulative <b>carcinogenic</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|Use of topical aloe vera is not {{associated}} with significant side effects. Oral ingestion of aloe vera, however, may cause abdominal cramps and diarrhea which in turn can decrease the absorption of drugs. IARC studies have found ingested non-decolorized liquid aloe vera to be <b>carcinogenic</b> in animals, and state {{that it is a}} possible carcinogen in humans as well.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is toxic, and {{ingestion}} {{may lead}} to acute lead poisoning, as is applicable for all soluble lead compounds. All inorganic lead compounds are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as probably <b>carcinogenic</b> to humans (Category2A). They {{have been linked to}} renal cancer and glioma in experimental animals and to renal cancer, brain cancer and lung cancer in humans, although studies of workers exposed to lead are often complicated by concurrent exposure to arsenic. Lead is known to substitute for zinc in a number of enzymes, including δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (porphobilinogen synthase) in the haem biosynthetic pathway and pyrimidine-5′-nucleotidase, important for the correct metabolism of DNA and can therefore cause fetal damage.|$|E
5|$|Nazi Germany had {{a strong}} anti-tobacco {{movement}} as pioneering research by Franz H. Müller in 1939 demonstrated a causal link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer. The Reich Health Office took measures to try to limit smoking, including producing lectures and pamphlets. Smoking was banned in many workplaces, on trains and among on-duty members of the military. Government agencies also worked to control other <b>carcinogenic</b> substances such as asbestos and pesticides. As {{part of a general}} public health campaign, water supplies were cleaned up, lead and mercury were removed from consumer products and women were urged to undergo regular screenings for breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} {{plays an}} important role in the nitrogen cycle. Azotobacter also synthesizes some biologically active substances, including some phytohormones such as auxins, thereby stimulating plant growth. They also facilitate the mobility of heavy metals in the soil, thus enhancing bioremediation of soil from heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury and lead. Some kinds of Azotobacter can also biodegrade chlorine-containing aromatic compounds, such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which was previously used as an insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide, but later was found to have mutagenic and <b>carcinogenic</b> effects.|$|E
5|$|Some {{studies have}} found that deep frying in olive and {{sunflower}} oils {{has been found to be}} less of a detriment to health and in some cases have positive effects on insulin levels. Oil can be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids. However, excessive use of the same oil can cause it to break down and release compounds into the food that may be <b>carcinogenic,</b> affect liver health, or influence the body's ability to absorb vitamins. Some European countries have set public health standards for the safety of frying oil.|$|E
5|$|TCDD and dioxin-like {{compounds}} act via {{a specific}} receptor {{present in all}} cells: the aryl hydrocarbon (AH) receptor. This receptor is a transcription factor which is involved in expression of genes; in fact {{it has been shown}} that high doses of TCDD either increase or decrease the expression of several hundred genes in rats. Genes of enzymes activating the breakdown of foreign and often toxic compounds are classic examples of such genes. TCDD increases the enzymes breaking down, e.g., <b>carcinogenic</b> polycyclic hydrocarbons such as benzo(a)pyrene.|$|E
5|$|TCDD may in some {{conditions}} potentiate the <b>carcinogenic</b> {{effects of}} other compounds. An example is benzo(a)pyrene that is metabolized in two steps, oxidation and conjugation. Oxidation produces epoxide carcinogens that are rapidly detoxified by conjugation, but some molecules may {{escape to the}} nucleus of the cell and bind to DNA causing a mutation, resulting in cancer initiation. When TCDD increases the activity of oxidative enzymes more than conjugation enzymes, the epoxide intermediates may increase, increasing the possibility of cancer initiation. Thus a beneficial activation of detoxifying enzymes may lead to deleterious side effects.|$|E
5|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer has {{classified}} cadmium and cadmium compounds as <b>carcinogenic</b> to humans. Although {{occupational exposure}} to cadmium {{is linked to}} lung and prostate cancer, {{there is still a}} substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in low environmental exposure. Recent data from epidemiological studies suggest that intake of cadmium through diet associates to higher risk of endometrial, breast and prostate cancer as well as to osteoporosis in humans. A recent study has demonstrated that endometrial tissue is characterized by higher levels of cadmium in current and former smoking females.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{essential}} for {{life can be}} toxic if taken in excess; some have notably toxic forms. Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is <b>carcinogenic</b> in animals and, when inhaled, causes DNA damage. The purple permanganate ion MnO is a liver and kidney poison. Ingesting more than 0.5 grams of iron can induce cardiac collapse; such overdoses most commonly occur in children and may result in death within 24 hours. Nickel carbonyl (Ni2(CO)4), at 30 parts per million, can cause respiratory failure, brain damage and death. Imbibing a gram or more of copper sulfate (Cu(SO4)2) can be fatal; survivors may be left with major organ damage. More than five milligrams of selenium is highly toxic; this is roughly ten times the 0.45 milligram recommended maximum daily intake; long-term poisoning can have paralytic effects.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi produce biologically active compounds, {{several of}} which are toxic to animals or plants and are {{therefore}} called mycotoxins. Of particular relevance to humans are mycotoxins produced by molds causing food spoilage, and poisonous mushrooms (see above). Particularly infamous are the lethal amatoxins in some Amanita mushrooms, and ergot alkaloids, which {{have a long history}} of causing serious epidemics of ergotism (St Anthony's Fire) in people consuming rye or related cereals contaminated with sclerotia of the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea. Other notable mycotoxins include the aflatoxins, which are insidious liver toxins and highly <b>carcinogenic</b> metabolites produced by certain Aspergillus species often growing in or on grains and nuts consumed by humans, ochratoxins, patulin, and trichothecenes (e.g., T-2 mycotoxin) and fumonisins, which have significant impact on human food supplies or animal livestock.|$|E
5|$|On 27 December 2011, presidential {{spokesman}} Alfredo Scoccimaro {{announced that}} Kirchner {{had been diagnosed}} with thyroid cancer on 22 December and that she would undergo surgery on 4 January 2012. The standard procedure in these operations is to expose the thyroid gland so that a pathologist can take a sample, analyze it looking for <b>carcinogenic</b> cells, and then decide whether it needs to be removed. In Kirchner's case, this step was omitted and the gland was removed directly. After the operation, it was revealed that she had been misdiagnosed and did not have cancer. On 5 October 2013, doctors ordered Kirchner to rest for a month after they found blood on her brain caused by a head injury she received on 8 August 2012. She was re-admitted to hospital and had successful surgery on 8 October 2013 to remove blood from under a membrane covering her brain.|$|E
5|$|Scandium has no {{biological}} role, but it {{is found}} in living organisms. Once reached a human, scandium concentrates in the liver and {{is a threat to}} it; some its compounds are possibly <b>carcinogenic,</b> even through in general scandium is not toxic. Scandium is known to have reached the food chain, but in trace amounts only; a typical human takes in less than 0.1micrograms per day. Once released into the environment, scandium gradually accumulates in soils, which leads to increased concentrations in soil particles, animals and humans. Scandium is mostly dangerous in the working environment, {{due to the fact that}} damps and gases can be inhaled with air. This can cause lung embolisms, especially during long-term exposure. The element is known to damage cell membranes of water animals, causing several negative influences on reproduction and on the functions of the nervous system.|$|E
5|$|Short-term {{exposure}} to zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only {{contact with the}} eyes requires medical attention. Persistent {{exposure to}} zirconium tetrachloride results in increased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and a decrease of blood hemoglobin and red blood cells in dogs. However, {{in a study of}} 20 rats given a standard diet containing ~4% zirconium oxide, there were no adverse effects on growth rate, blood and urine parameters, or mortality. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for zirconium exposure is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 10mg/m3. At levels of 25mg/m3, zirconium is immediately dangerous to life and health. However, zirconium is not considered an industrial health hazard. Furthermore, reports of zirconium-related adverse reactions are rare and, in general, rigorous cause-and-effect relationships have not been established. No evidence has been validated that zirconium is <b>carcinogenic</b> or genotoxic.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic {{chemical}} {{production has}} escalated following the stimulus it received {{during the second}} World War. Chemical production includes everything from herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances. Apart from the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, chemicals of particular concern include: heavy metals, nuclear waste, chlorofluorocarbons, persistent organic pollutants and all harmful chemicals capable of bioaccumulation. Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless {{there needs to be}} rigorous testing of new chemicals, in all countries, for adverse environmental and health effects. International legislation has been established to deal with the global distribution and management of dangerous goods. The effects of some chemical agents needed long-term measurements and a lot of legal battles to realize their danger to human health. The classification of the toxic <b>carcinogenic</b> agents is handle by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.|$|E
5|$|TCDD was {{classified}} in 1997 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a carcinogen for humans (group 1). In the occupational cohort studies {{available for the}} classification, the risk, even at very high exposures, was weak and borderline detectable. Therefore, human data were not deemed sufficient, and the classification was, in essence, based on animal experiments and mechanistic considerations. This has been criticized as a deviation from IARC classification rules. It is much debated whether TCDD is <b>carcinogenic</b> only at high doses which also cause toxic damage of tissues. Moreover, a recent review concludes that, after 1997, further studies do not support an association between TCDD exposure and cancer risk. New studies include the update of Vietnam veteran studies from Ranch Hand operation, which concluded that after 30 years the results do not provide evidence of disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of a PAH influences whether and how the individual compound is <b>carcinogenic.</b> Some <b>carcinogenic</b> PAHs are genotoxic and induce mutations that initiate cancer; others are not genotoxic and instead affect cancer promotion or progression.|$|E
25|$|Nitrosamines, {{present in}} {{processed}} and cooked foods, {{have been noted}} as being <b>carcinogenic,</b> being linked to colon cancer. Also, toxic compounds called PAHs, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, present in processed, smoked and cooked foods, {{are known to be}} <b>carcinogenic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{carcinogenity}} {{of tobacco}} smoke is not explained by nicotine per se, {{which is not}} <b>carcinogenic</b> or mutagenic, although it is a metabolic precursor for several compounds which are. In addition, it inhibits apoptosis, therefore accelerating existing cancers. Also, NNK, a nicotine derivative converted from nicotine, can be <b>carcinogenic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lead(II,IV) oxide {{was shown}} to be <b>carcinogenic</b> for {{laboratory}} animals. Its carcinogenicity for humans was not proven.|$|E
25|$|WHO {{organization}} International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) list AAS under Group 2A: Probably <b>carcinogenic</b> to humans.|$|E
25|$|Pepper {{contains}} phytochemicals, including amides, piperidines, pyrrolidines {{and trace}} amounts of safrole, {{which may be}} <b>carcinogenic</b> in laboratory rodents.|$|E
