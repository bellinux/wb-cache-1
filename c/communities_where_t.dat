40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analysis}} on literature about microsociolinguistics, where you can also see a lack of theoretical congruence, are shown in this paper. The authors classify the works in three groups, depending on the community with which they deal: <b>communities</b> <b>where</b> the main spoken language is Catalan, <b>communities</b> <b>where</b> it is Spanish or <b>communities</b> <b>where</b> Catalan became extinct. From the first two groups, they review phonological and morphological studies. From the third, they suggest the study of language vestiges in <b>communities</b> <b>where</b> Catalan became extinct. Finally, they claim that macro and microsocionlinguistics should be unified and remark the interest of language variation studies for the language planning...|$|R

It is argued that this algorithm permits an annealing schedule for ‘‘temperature’’ T decreasing exponentially in annealing-time k, T = T 0 exp(−ck 1 /D). The introduction of re-annealing also permits adaptation to changing sensitivities in the multidimensional parameter-space. This annealing schedule is faster than fast Cauchy annealing, <b>where</b> <b>T</b> = T 0 /k, and much faster than Boltzmann annealing, <b>where</b> <b>T</b> = T 0 / ln k. Applications are being made to fit empirical data to Lagrangians representing nonlinear Gaussian-Markovian systems...|$|R
