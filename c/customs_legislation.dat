40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a topical {{question}} of legal consolidation in the tax and the <b>customs</b> <b>legislations</b> of the fee for goods purchased from a foreign company through a transaction concluded by the information and telecommunications network "Internet". According to the legislator, such innovations will limit the spillover of online orders to the neighboring states with a high threshold for duty-free shipping, which will strengthen the domestic e-commerce market. The authors believe that the consolidation of the institution in the national legislation would contradict the general provisions of tax legislation. The authors believe that such measures will {{increase the number of}} sham and mock transactions and reduce import turnover. The proposed projects of the European Economic Commission of the European Economic Union on the Internet fees in their structure are poorly written, in particular, they lack the concept of internet purchase, there is no resolution of the issue {{of the relationship between the}} collection and the value added tax. The authors come to the conclusion that these projects should to be completed, in particular, it is proposed to supplement the provisions of domestic legislation, delimiting the object of taxation the value added tax on the object of taxation for cross-border fee to be paid for an online purchase. Their immediate implementation without significant changes will not create a proper mechanism for the implementation of this institution, and generate a lot of conflict situation...|$|R

An early interest was the reform {{of the international monetary}} system, having been the ‘Benjamin’ in the eminent Bürgenstock Group of academics and bankers, who paved the way for floating exchange rates in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He has also published on international migration and the relocation of industries from mature, high-cost economies to new, low-cost places, as well as on institutional economics, i.e. the importance of habits, work practices, <b>customs,</b> <b>legislation</b> and regulations to shaping a community's economic growth potential. In a complex modern economy with an emphasis on differentiated services, mores and laws constitute ‘institutional capital’, which is central to international competitiveness and the long-term growth potential.

Moreover, he claimed the reason he had removed the EPO name stickers from all vials, was not because he intended to mislead anybody, but simply because he did not want any riders to worry about the content of his package. When the prosecutor asked him why he had also opted to remove the small medical description pages, which by law is required always to follow dangerous medicines with possible negative counter effects on health, he provided no explanation for that.|$|E
50|$|A first {{council and}} mayor (Schultheiss) {{in the medieval}} town of Rapperswil may be {{suspected}} for the period after its founding around 1220 AD. The earliest document sealed at the Rapperswil Castle, related to the donation {{of the church of}} Bollingen to the Rüti Abbey, mentions among others a civitas as witnesses of Count Rudolf von Rapperswil in 1229. Between 1267 and 1282, when the fiefs were given back by the German king to Elisabeth von Rapperswil, the citizens, clergy and nobility executed the representatives of Elisabeth's brother Count Rudolf III who died in 1267. The seal of the town of Rapperswil respectively citizenry first appeared in 1277. In 1337 Johann I von Laufenburg-Rapperswil died, that's probably why in 1341 the court council (German: Kleiner Rat) consisting of 12 members and the mayor (German: Schultheiss) was first mentioned in Rapperswil; since 1415 the council also appointed the Vogt of the Wurmsbach Abbey, a foundation of Countess Elisabeth's father and mother. Johann II von Laufenburg-Rapperswil had to sell Rapperswil and all rights to Hasburg in the late 1350s; Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, who rebuilt Rapperswil after the war with the city of Zürich and also re-established the prehistorical and Roman era lake crossing at the Seedamm isthmus, granted the citizenry the related <b>customs</b> <b>legislation</b> in 1360. King Wenceslas securitized liberation from foreign courts in 1379, and in 1406 the citizenry was allowed to elect their mayor. For the first time in 1442, the bicameral city government, being composed of the 12-seat Kleiner Rat and the 24-seat Grosser Rat, exercised the blood jurisdiction under the chairmanship of the mayor. Since 1481 the grand council was elected by the members of Kleiner Rat. Council genders include among others the Landenberg, Russinger (Russikon), Göldlin, Breny, Rothenfluh and Kunz families.|$|E
