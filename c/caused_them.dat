5|$|In 2010 the Crusaders had a {{very good}} start to the season before a poor finish with three losses in four games <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> to have to travel to Orlando Stadium, Soweto to face the Bulls. They lost the semi-final 39–24.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{there was}} a {{worldwide}} disbandment of British forts as advances in air defence systems <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> to become obsolete. Today, the ruins of coastal fortifications are still visible at Labrador Battery, Mount Faber, Fort Siloso and Fort Canning that serve as a lasting reminder of their wartime legacy in Fortress Singapore.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Fort Donelson to Grant's army on February 16, the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, two major water routes in the Confederate west, became Union {{waterways}} for movement of troops and material. As Grant suspected, the Union capture of the two forts and the rivers flanked the Confederate forces at Columbus, and soon <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> to withdraw from that city and from western Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|But on {{the wings}} the {{situation}} was different. Qanatir, commanding the Byzantine left flank which consisted of mainly Slavs, attacked in force, and the Muslim infantry on the right flank had to retreat. Amr, the Muslim right wing commander ordered his cavalry regiment to counterattack, which neutralized the Byzantine advance and stabilized the battle line on the right for some time, but the Byzantine numerical superiority <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> to retreat towards the Muslim base camp.|$|E
5|$|Deprived of {{his left}} wing (still {{in pursuit of the}} Norman right), Alexios was exposed in the centre. Guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against the Byzantine centre. They first routed the Byzantine skirmishers before {{breaking}} into small detachments and smashing into various points of the Byzantine line. This charge broke the Byzantine lines and <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> to rout. The imperial camp, which had been left unguarded, fell to the Normans.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari's team orders <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> to {{be fined}} $100,000 by the race {{stewards}} but avoided further punishment from the FIA World Motor Sport Council in September 2010. The result meant Alonso reduced the points deficit to be 13 behind Vettel in the Drivers' Championship, while leader Lewis Hamilton extended his advantage over teammate Jenson Button by two points. Red Bull slightly reduced the deficit to McLaren in the Constructors' Championship, while Ferrari moved further ahead of Mercedes, with eight races {{left in the}} season.|$|E

Massaro also alleges that she was sexually assaulted at a US military base during a WWE tour of Kuwait and that WWE apologized but persuaded her not to report it to the appropriate authorities.|$|E
5|$|Lody {{was unaware}} that his latest letters had {{galvanised}} the British authorities into action. They had hitherto been content with merely monitoring his communications but the militarily significant content {{of his most}} recent letters <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> to consider him now {{to be a serious}} threat. It did not take them long to catch up with him. His lack of even basic security precautions had left the authorities with a trail of clues that enabled them to track him down in less than a day.|$|E

In February 2012, seventy ministers of La Luz del Mundo from different nations appeared before Mexican authorities in Guadalajara to denounce the lack of police protection for the church's residents in the city after a series of attacks left several members hospitalized.|$|E

5|$|The Shasekishū, {{a book of}} Buddhist parables {{from the}} Kamakura period, {{makes a point of}} {{distinguishing}} between good and bad tengu. The book explains that the former are in command of the latter and are the protectors, not opponents, of Buddhism– although the flaw of pride or ambition has <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> to fall onto the demon road, they remain the same basically good, dharma-abiding persons they were in life.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the siege marked the {{beginning}} of Muhammad's undoubted political ascendancy in the city of Medina. The Meccans had exerted their utmost strength to dislodge Muhammad from Medina, and this defeat <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> to lose their trade with Syria and much of their prestige with it. Watt conjectures that the Meccans at this point began to contemplate that conversion to Islam would be the most prudent option.|$|E

Rwigyema became the RPF leader shortly after joining and, while still working for the Ugandan army, he and Kagame completed their invasion plans.|$|E

This panic demonstrated the complete instability of the financial system of America and the hazards which businessmen had to meet under a grossly defective banking system.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} in 1844 {{is said to}} have {{wiped out}} the population of Cuban macaws from Pinar del Río. Subsequent hurricanes in 1846 and 1856 further destroyed their habitat in western Cuba and scattered the remaining population. In addition, a tropical storm hit the Zapata Swamp in 1851. With a healthy macaw population, such events could have been beneficial by creating suitable habitat. However, given the species' precarious position, it may have resulted in fragmented habitat and <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> to seek food in areas where they were more vulnerable to hunting.|$|E
5|$|After fifth-place {{finishes}} in 1968 and 1969 (the latter {{in the newly}} created six-team American League East division), the 1970 Yankees improved to second in the AL East with a 93–69 record, finishing behind the Baltimore Orioles. Catcher Thurman Munson played his first full season for the Yankees and won AL Rookie of the Year honors for 1970. New York had 11 more losses during their 1971 season than they had in 1970, but in 1972 they contended for the AL East title and a playoff berth. Late in the season, the Yankees were in a four-way tie for the most wins in the division, but a slump <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> to fall to fourth {{by the end of}} their campaign with a record of 79–76.|$|E

5|$|After {{two seasons}} in Kansas City, the {{franchise}} moved to Denver and was renamed the Colorado Rockies it {{played at the}} McNichols Sports Arena. The team won its first game as the Rockies, 4–2, against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Rockies were in position {{to qualify for the}} playoffs 60 games into the 1976–77 season, but a streak of 18 games without a win <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> to fall from contention. The Rockies ended the campaign last in the division with a 20–46–14 record and 54 points, and improved to 59 points the next season. Despite having the sixth-worst record in the League, the Rockies beat-out the Vancouver Canucks for second in the Division by two points and gained a playoff berth. The Philadelphia Flyers eliminated the Rockies from the playoffs in the preliminary rounds.|$|E
5|$|Alert to {{the danger}} {{presented}} to his scattered ranks, Richard, prudent as ever, halted and regrouped his forces once more after a further pursuit. The Ayyubid cavalry turned once again, showing they still had stomach to renew the fight. However, a third and final charge <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> to scatter into the woodland where they dispersed into the hills in all directions, showing no inclination to continue the conflict. Richard led his cavalry back to Arsuf where the infantry had pitched camp. During the night the Saracen dead were looted.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} proceeds, flashbacks occur showing events in Harris and Klebold's lives {{which may have}} <b>caused</b> <b>them</b> to commit murder; real life events are {{compressed}} into the game's timeframe for narrative purposes.

In contrast to the 16-bit graphics are digitized photographs from the shooting or full voice samples from news reports; photos of the school are used as backdrops during battle scenes.|$|E
