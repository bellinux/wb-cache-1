5|$|Fleischmann and Weissmandl's rescue group, the Working Group, {{devised a}} more ambitious {{proposal}} in November that year. Known as the Europa plan or Grossplan, {{the aim was}} to bribe the SS with money from Jews overseas, primarily the United States, to stop the deportation of all Jews to Poland. Various sums have been mentioned in <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> including $2–3 million. Nothing came of it, reportedly because Heinrich Himmler intervened in August 1943.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} Mercator on the cartographic scene {{would have been}} noted by the cognoscenti who {{purchased}} Gemma's globe—the professors, rich merchants, prelates, aristocrats and courtiers of the emperor Charles V at nearby Brussels. The commissions and patronage of such wealthy individuals would provide {{an important source of}} income throughout his life. His <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> world of privilege was facilitated by his fellow student Antoine Perrenot, soon to be appointed Bishop of Arras, and Antoine's father, Nicholas Perrenot, the Chancellor of CharlesV.|$|E

In <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> when she married Ernest Freeman on 26 July 1948, Massaquoi adopted his tribal name Fahnbulleh, calling herself Fatima Massaquoi-Fahnbulleh. Her husband also changed his own name back to Fahnbulleh. To further contribute to the cultural and social development of Liberia, she organized a seminar through the African Studies Program in 1962 to promote the standardization of the Vai script.|$|E
5|$|From 1–14 February 1945, Hartmann briefly led I. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 53 {{as acting}} Gruppenkommandeur {{until he was}} {{replaced}} by Helmut Lipfert. In March 1945, Hartmann, his score now standing at 336 aerial victories, was asked a second time by General Adolf Galland to join the Me262 units forming to fly the new jet fighter. Hartmann attended the jet conversion program led by Heinrich Bär. Galland also intended Hartmann to fly with Jagdverband 44. Hartmann declined the offer, preferring to remain with JG52. Some sources report that Hartmann's decision to stay with his unit was due to a request via telegram made by Oberstleutnant Hermann Graf. Now Gruppenkommandeur of I./JG52, Erich Hartmann claimed his 350th aerial victory on 17 April, {{in the vicinity of}} Chrudim. The last wartime photograph of Hartmann known was taken in <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> victory.|$|E
5|$|Maria made an {{agreement}} with her sister, Bronisława, that she would give her financial assistance during Bronisława's medical studies in Paris, in exchange for similar assistance two years later. In <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> Maria took a position as governess: first as a home tutor in Warsaw; then for two years as a governess in Szczuki with a landed family, the Żorawskis, who were relatives of her father. While working for the latter family, {{she fell in love}} with their son, Kazimierz Żorawski, a future eminent mathematician. His parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative, and Kazimierz was unable to oppose them. Maria's loss of the relationship with Żorawski was tragic for both. He soon earned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician, becoming a professor and rector of Kraków University. Still, as an old man and a mathematics professor at the Warsaw Polytechnic, he would sit contemplatively before the statue of Maria Skłodowska which had been erected in 1935 before the Radium Institute that she had founded in 1932.|$|E
