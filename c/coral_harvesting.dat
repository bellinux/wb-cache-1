40|$|Precious <b>coral</b> <b>harvested</b> in the Mediterranean Sea and the {{northern}} Pacific Ocean is of commercial value yet excessive fishing {{has led to a}} serious decline in its abundance. Consequently, there is now international discussion about controlling the world trade of precious coral. To explore the possibility of a sustainable fishery of Japanese red coral (Paracorallium japonicum), the morphometry and the population structure of populations in a non-harvested area and in a harvested area were investigated using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) off Amami Island, Southern Japan, in 2009. In the harvested population, the estimated modal ages are 10 to 20 years. In contrast, the main mode in the non-harvested population extends widely from 20 to 40 years, with a small but distinct secondary mode between 50 and 60 years. Commercially collected specimens are mainly 30 – 40 years old. The difference in the modes of non-harvested and harvested populations suggests that harvested populations return to the pre-fishing level after at least 10 – 20 years of a biological rest period. This study indicates a rotational harvest is useful for sustainable management...|$|R

Over recent years, there has been increased development of the coastline in Fiji which has lead to pressure on the surrounding reefs. Degradation of reefs has been observed as the result of factors such as increased erosion on land and siltation of reefs, water pollution, overfishing, and <b>coral</b> <b>harvesting.</b> ‘Natural’ events such as coral bleaching and crown of thorn starfish infestations have also episodically affected Fiji’s reefs (Zann 1994) ...|$|E

To better manage coral harvest, we used standard fishery-yield methods to generate sustainable-harvest guide-lines for corymbose Acropora species found on the reef flat and crest at Lababia, PNG. We constructed a yield curve (weight-specific net annual-dry-weight production) by: 1) describ-ing the allometric relationship between colony size and dry weight, and using that relation-ship to estimate the dry weight of Acropora colonies in situ; 2) estimating annual growth of Acropora colonies by estimating in situ, and describing the relationship between, colony dry weight at the beginning and end of one year; and 3) conducting belt-transect surveys to describe weight-frequencies and ultimately to predict annual weight change per square meter for each weight class. Reef habitat covers a total 2, 467, 550 m 2 at Lababia and pro-duces an estimated 248, 397 kg/y (dry weight) of corymbose Acropora, of which 203, 897 k...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulation}} of the red <b>coral</b> <b>harvesting</b> in Sardinia has a long history. Since 1979, to enable a sustainable exploitation of coral resource, harvesting has been ruled {{by the introduction of}} several restrictions (Regional Law n. 59 - 5 July 1979 “Coral Fishing Regulation”, partly modified by the Regional Law n. 23 of 30 th May 1989). Taking into account that these regulations could have affected the status of the red coral banks, the spatial distribution of the deep red coral resource in the Northern and Western coasts of Sardinian has been studied and, at present, the status of banks 5 is continuously monitored. Three zones with different demography and density have been identified from data on size structure obtained both by ROV video transects and colony sampling by professional divers. The specific ecological causes affecting the different observed red coral morphological structures are the object of an ongoing study. Moreover, data on growth pattern and reproductive biology are presented. Two different growth rates were found for the deep colonies collected in the Northern and North western coast of Sardinia. Furthermore, the reproductive features of deep and shallow colonies of C. rubrum, collected between late May and June, are illustrated and compared. The analyses included the reproductive status of both polyps and colonies. Important reproductive parameters as fecundity and fertility of both female and male colonies for different size classes are also described...|$|E

40|$|Corals are {{amongst the}} most {{conspicuous}} sessile organisms found on the hard substrates of seamounts. They include a diverse array of groups within the phylum Cnidaria, includ-ing the Scleractinia (stony corals), Antipatharia (black corals), Zoanthidea (zoanthids), Octocorallia (gorgonians, sea fans, soft corals) and Stylasteridae (hydrocorals). Estimating global coral diversity on seamounts is complicated {{by a lack of}} samples. However, they are {{an important component of the}} species diversity found on seamounts, playing a pivotal role in structuring the environment. In particular, some scleractinian corals have the abil-ity to form cold-water reefs that may have a diverse community of associated organisms. Gorgonian corals may form dense stands that also play a structural role in communities of fi sh and other organisms. Corals found on seamounts show a diverse range of life histor-ies although patterns of recruitment to populations are not understood. Isotopic methods for ageing corals have revealed that individual colonies may be slow growing and can live for hundreds to thousands of years. The distribution of corals on seamounts depends on a variety of physical and biological factors. Relative distribution of the coral groups differs regionally and between oceans, refl ecting differences in ocean chemistry, productivity and biogeography. The different coral groups also show signifi cant differences in depth of occur-rence resulting from differences in trophic ecology and other aspects of biology. Because of their fragility, conservative life histories and limited geographic distribution, cold-water corals are vulnerable to the impacts of human exploitation through <b>coral</b> <b>harvesting</b> or as bycatch of fi shing, especially trawling. Changes in ocean chemistry resulting from climate change are also a signifi cant threat to corals on seamounts and other marine habitats...|$|E
40|$|Social and {{cultural}} institutions influence how societies organize themselves to extract resources, affecting {{the ways in}} which resources are used and ultimately managed. In Papua New Guinea, marine tenure rights largely determine how individuals and communities use inshore marine resources. Whether institutions of customary marine tenure can play a role in resource conservation or are simply mechanisms to avoid conflict and maximize exploitation is a matter of debate. In the Manus Province, an unusual marine tenure and trade arrangement has resulted in the community of Andra producing the majority of lime powder used for consumption with betel nut. A socioeconomic and ecological assessment revealed that more than 90 % of Andra's community was engaged in lime production, an industry contributing an estimated US$ 102, 000 ± 28, 000 to the village annually. The main source of material used in lime production at Andra is live branching coral (primarily Acropora spp.). The annual removal of approximately 2, 113 ± 660 m 3 of coral appears to have produced significant changes in coral cover in Andra's reefs, resulting in a lower percent cover of hard corals (24 ± 2 % SE) compared with neighboring reefs with little harvesting (33 ± 3 % SE). Existing common-property regimes may provide incentives for individuals to sustainably use their own reef area. A lapse in supply, however, could threaten the community's virtual monopoly and provide other villages with an opportunity to gain a market share of lime production. Thus, the marine tenure and trade arrangements that facilitated Andra's position as the dominant supplier of lime to the province may result in incentives for the overexploitation of coral in ways that are paradoxical to an open-access scenario. Management interventions that aim to reduce the ecological impacts of <b>coral</b> <b>harvesting</b> should reflect the community's economic dependence on the practice and the sociocultural institutions that influence resource use...|$|E

To better manage coral harvest, we used standard fishery-yield methods to generate sustainable-harvest guidelines for corymbose Acropora species found on the reef flat and crest at Lababia, PNG. We constructed a yield curve (weight-specific net annual-dry-weight production) by: 1) describing the allometric relationship between colony size and dry weight, and using that relationship to estimate the dry weight of Acropora colonies in situ; 2) estimating annual growth of Acropora colonies by estimating in situ, and describing the relationship between, colony dry weight at the beginning and end of one year; and 3) conducting belt-transect surveys to describe weight-frequencies and ultimately to predict annual weight change per square meter for each weight class. Reef habitat covers a total 2, 467, 550 m 2 at Lababia and produces an estimated 248, 397 kg/y (dry weight) of corymbose Acropora, of which 203, 897 kg is produced on the reef flat/crest. We conservatively estimate that 30, 706. 6 kg of whole, dry, corymbose, Acropora can be sustainably harvested from the reef flat/crest habitat each year provided each culled colony weighs at least 1805 g when dry (or is at least 46 cm along its major axis). Artisanal lime-makers convert 24. 8 % of whole-colony weight into marketable lime, thus we estimate 7615. 2 g of lime can be sustainably produced annually from corymbose Acropora. This value incorporates several safety margins, and should lead to proper management of live coral harvest. Importantly, the guideline recognizes village rights to exploit its marine resources, is consistent with village needs for income, and balances an equally strong village desire to conserve its marine resources for future generations...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to supply an {{overview}} of all historical and recent knowledge on landings, fishing and geographic distribution of the red coral banks along the Italian coasts in order to make a contribution to the conservation and future management of this resource. Along the Italian coasts, the banks have been exploited for millennia, using non-selective trawling gear that was banned in Europe in 1994. Today, harvesting is allowed only by scuba divers and regulated by specific laws. We examined 153 years of history of coral fishing in Italy, from Unification (1861) to 2014. Data about the coralline fleets and the amount of coral landings were recorded for the considered span of time. From a quantitative point of view, the coral fishing in Italy in the last 150 years has been dominated by the sub-fossil coral reservoirs from the Sciacca Banks (Sicily Channel), where an extraordinary amount of 18, 000 tons was collected in 34 years (1875 – 1888 and 1893 – 1914). This amount represents about 90 % of all red <b>coral</b> <b>harvested</b> along the Italian coast in the last 150 years. Excluding this period, the average annual yield was initially around 100 tons, decreasing to 28 tons 100 years later, therefore demonstrating a severe overexploitation of the resource. The great part of the deep red coral banks was abandoned because harvesting was no longer profitable. Nevertheless, quantitative data suggest that red coral banks, even though overexploited, are still wide- spread along Italian coasts, mainly in shallow waters. These banks show a remarkable persistence although with a generalised shift towards smaller colony sizes and higher density. The time span necessary in recovering the pristine structure, following the end of the fishing activities, appears very long and the populations of several areas might be unable to re-colonise the old and overexploited banks...|$|R

[...] Coral based xenografts are mainly calcium carbonate (and an important proportion of fluorides, useful in the context of grafting to promote bone development) while natural human bone is made of hydroxyapatite along with calcium phosphate and carbonate: the coral material is thus either transformed industrially into hydroxyapatite through a hydrothermal process, yielding a non-resorbable xenograft, or simply the process is omitted and the coralline material remains in its calcium carbonate state for better resorption of the graft by the natural bone. The coral xenograft is then saturated with growth enhancing gels and solutions.|$|R

40|$|A {{scarcity}} of life-history data currently exists for many exploited coral reef fishes, hindering {{our ability to}} interpret fishery dynamics and develop sound conservation policies. In particular, parrotfishes (Family Labridae) represent a ubiquitous and ecologically important group that is increasingly prevalent in commercial and artisanal fisheries worldwide. We used both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data to {{examine the effect of}} life histories on vulnerability to overexploitation in parrotfishes. Vulnerability for each species was derived from independent measures associated with both temporal (20 -year catch records) and spatial datasets. Most life-history traits examined were significant predictors of vulnerability across species, but their relative utility differed considerably. Length-based traits (e. g., lengths at maturity and sex change, maximum length) were generally superior to age-based traits (e. g., life span), but one age-based trait, age at female maturation, was the best predictor. The results suggest that easily derived metrics such as maximum length can be effective measures of sensitivity to exploitation when applied to phylogenetically related multispecies assemblages, but more holistic and comprehensive age-based demographic data should be sought, especially in data-deficient and heavily impacted regions. Given the increasing prevalence of parrotfishes in the global <b>coral</b> reef <b>harvest,</b> species-specific responses demonstrate the capacity for heavy fishing pressure to alter parrotfish assemblages considerably...|$|R
50|$|Living {{coral reefs}} are {{endangered}} and cannot be harvested without significant {{damage to the}} ecosystem, and because of this, <b>coral</b> calcium is <b>harvested</b> by grinding up above-ground limestone deposits that were once part of a coral reef.

It is marketed as a dietary supplement, but its benefits over other calcium supplements are unproven and biologically unlikely, and several marketers have been found guilty of fraud and were ordered to pay $20.4 million and to refrain from making unsubstantiated claims in the future. Additionally, coral near Okinawa has absorbed relatively high amounts of lead and mercury, leading to concern that these unregulated supplements may be contaminated. Further, coral takes millennia to grow, leading to environmental concerns.|$|R
40|$|With {{the ongoing}} {{transition}} between the barter and the cash economy in Papua New Guinea (PNG), traditional resource production and exploitation must {{adapt to the}} changing markets. The increasing demands {{for goods and services}} have resulted in coastal and marine resources in PNG showing signs of overexploitation. Andra Island in Manus Province is one of many islands whose inhabitants are highly dependent on the sea for sustenance and livelihoods. Ecological studies by the Wildlife Conservation Society have revealed that the surrounding reefs are denuded of branching Acropora corals compared with similar sites in Manus and elsewhere. This is likely to be due to the island’s economic dependence on the <b>harvest</b> of Acropora <b>corals</b> for the coral lime trade. Lime (calcium hydroxide) is chewed with betelnut (Areca catechu) throughout most coastal regions of PNG, and Andra has a monopoly on the lime trade in Manus. A coral farming project was implemented with the aim of providing a sustainable means of maintaining the coral lime trade. Unlike other coral farming projects in the Pacific, this project operates completely at the local scale and is not reliant on overseas markets; nor does it face the logistical challenges of the aquarium trade.

50|$|Although some marine {{aquarium}} fish species can reproduce in aquaria (such as Pomacentridae), most (95%) are collected from <b>coral</b> reefs. Intense <b>harvesting,</b> especially in maritime Southeast Asia (including Indonesia and the Philippines), damages the reefs. This is aggravated by destructive fishing practices, such as cyanide and blast fishing. Most (80-90%) aquarium {{fish from the}} Philippines are captured with sodium cyanide. This toxic chemical is dissolved in sea water and released into areas where fish shelter. It narcotizes the fish, which are then easily captured. However, most fish collected with cyanide die {{a few months later}} from liver damage. Moreover, many non-marketable specimens die in the process. It is estimated that 4,000 or more Filipino fish collectors have used over 1000000 kg of cyanide on Philippine reefs alone, about 150,000 kg per year. A major catalyst of cyanide fishing is poverty within fishing communities. In countries like the Philippines that regularly employ cyanide, more than thirty percent of the population lives below the poverty line.|$|R
40|$|Octocorals are an {{important}} part of many ecosystems as they add three-dimensional complexity to the benthos and thereby increase biodiversity. The Mediterranean red coral (Corallium rubrum, L. 1758) is a longevous octocoral that is harvested commercially, yet natural and anthropogenic influences on its population size structure are little understood. This study found that some <b>harvested</b> red <b>coral</b> populations had a significantly different size structure when compared to populations at the nearby Marine Protected Area (MPA) of Medas Islands at the Spanish Costa Brava (NW Mediterranean). Eighty-nine percent of the red <b>corals</b> in the <b>harvested</b> Costa Brava area are less than 10 years old and 96 % of all colonies have not yet grown more than second-order branches. The size/age distribution of the harvested population is notably skewed towards younger and smaller colonies. Thus, although red coral is still abundant, its population structure is strongly distorted by harvesting. The results confirm that MPAs are useful to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural influences on population structure. However, 14 years of protection appears to be an insufficient recovery time for a longevous octocoral population such as red coral...|$|R
50|$|John Busst's Great Barrier Reef {{campaign}} {{received much}} publicity {{and has been}} well documented in Australian ecology and conservation literature. Following public notice of a cane grower's intention to <b>harvest</b> <b>coral</b> from 84 acres (33.9ha) of supposedly dead reef (as a cheap source of agricultural lime) in 1967, Busst lodged an objection and gathered evidence to prove that Ellison Reef was alive. The ensuing battle involved a number of influential environmentalist groups including the: Australian Conservation Foundation, Queensland Wildlife Preservation Society, the Queensland Littoral Society (renamed the Australian Marine Conservation Society), and the Wildlife Conservation Society (US). Busst also circulated an objection (addressed to the Minister for Mines) to the Premier and the Ministers for Tourism and Conservation and the Director-General of the Queensland Government Tourist Bureau. He attracted wide press coverage for the case and enlisted the help of his long-time friend Prime Minister Harold Holt who, after being introduced to Bingil Bay by John Busst, built a holiday home nearby. Six months after the hearings in the Innisfail Courthouse, Queensland Mines Minister Ron Camm rejected the mining application. This landmark case set a precedent for not mining the reef, brought the question of exploiting the Reef's resources into the public arena and served as a cornerstone for the conservation movement in Queensland.|$|R
