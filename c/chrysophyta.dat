The method applied in this study was the experimental method with 4 treatments, i. e. : the use of fermented feed with the addition of cassava peel flour (0 %, 25 %, 50 %, and 75 %) and probiotic in Tilapia culture media. Each treatment was replicated 4 times. Sampling was carried out 6 times at intervals of 2 weeks. The observed parameters were the main parameters, i. e. : the number of <b>Chrysophyta</b> species and individuals; and supporting parameters, i. e. : water temperature, pH, TDS, TSS, NO 3, NO 2, BOD 5, DO, and total of phosphate. Species richness and abundance of <b>Chrysophyta</b> data were analyzed using cluster analysis based on Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient. The analysis continued with Similarity Percentages (SIMPER) analysis to determine the contribution of species to the similarity index in each group or to dissimilarity index amongst groups.

40|$|In Lake Constance, {{after several}} decades of cutrophication, a {{decrease}} in phosphorus loading {{over the last decade}} has lead to a partial recovery from eutrophication. Here we analyse the shift in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton during the first decade of oligotrophication in Lake Constance. During the 1980 s, spring total P concentrations decreased from ca. 130 to less than 50 mgr·l– 1. This decrease was reflected by an approximately proportional decrease in summer phytoplankton biomass while spring phytoplankton biomass seemed unresponsive. Major taxonomic changes occured during both growth seasons. In spring, the proportion of diatoms, green algae and <b>Chrysophyta</b> increased while the proportion of Cryptophyta decreased. The summer trend was very different: the relative importance of diatoms decreased and Cryptophyta and <b>Chrysophyta</b> increased, while Chlorophyta reached their peak around 1985. These trends are also analysed at the genus level. Comparison with taxonomic trends during the eutrophication period shows the expected reversals in most cases. Comparison with other lakes shows general similarities, with the notable exception that Planktothrix rubescens has never been important in Lake Constance. The increase of diatoms during spring is attributed to their improved competitive performance with increasing Si:P ratios. Their decrease during summer is explained by the increasing silicate removal from the epilimnion by increasing spring populations...|$|E

The data were collected in 1996 - 97 (Phase I, as a background data and undisturbed ecosystem) and in 2005 (Phase II, as a disturbed ecosystem) at sampling points (from 10 to 100 m depths). In addition to the two main sampling exercises, additional sample collections were carried out {{during the period of}} 1994 to 2004 as a long-term study.
