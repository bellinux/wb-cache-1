50|$|Corrugated (also called pleated) {{paper was}} {{patented}} in England in 1856, {{and used as}} a liner for tall hats, but corrugated boxboard was not patented and used as a shipping material until December 20, 1871. The patent was issued to Albert Jones of New York City for single-sided (single-face) <b>corrugated</b> <b>board.</b> Jones used the <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> for wrapping bottles and glass lantern chimneys. The first machine for producing large quantities of <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> was built in 1874 by G.

Her first work cycles consist of sculptures, paintings and installations. Given {{the fact that}} the conventional canvas has been absent in Staehli’s raw and expressive painting from the very beginning, the canvas being replaced by everyday materials such as <b>corrugated</b> <b>boards</b> or paper bags, Staehli’s art departs from the sheltered space of traditional art. In a second phase, her artworks metamorphose into wearable sculptures, i.e., the so-called “Big Heads”, which in turn become props for interacting with the real world in performances and videos. Drawing on years of acting experience, she integrates photography, film, literature and theater into her unique body of work, and has collaborated with curators, museums, galleries, writers and art journalists to do so. She has also carried out a number of site-specific art projects in Switzerland and Berlin.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the development of}} an optimization of the package for a certain air purifier. The new design was more environmentally friendly, cheaper to produce, saves storage space and simplifies the repacking processes. The concept was generated in the concept generation phase, and selected among other concepts with the help of Pugh Matrix. After an iterative development process of cushioning design, drop simulation and drop tests, the proposed concept was verified by drop simulations in ANSYS, drop tests following the ISTA 3 A standard, and a brief Life Cycle Assessment. Future work was also proposed based on the findings in the project. The theoretical background of the design, the various methods which were used in the development process and the development process itself were presented and discussed in this article. A method of rapid cushioning development was also concluded. The method was suitable for developing a cushioning system made of pre-compressed <b>corrugated</b> paper <b>board</b> based on an existing cushioning system. The method was designed to achieve a rapid iterative development for a new cushioning design with pre-compressed <b>corrugated</b> paper <b>board</b> based on an existing cushioning design...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The flat {{compression}} {{properties of}} corrugated sandwich structure {{are an important}} factor to evaluate their cushioning properties. At present, more research has been made on the mechanical properties in the cross direction (CD) and machine direction (MD), but less {{has been made in}} the flat compression direction. Selecting corrugated paperboards as samples, we analyzed the flat compression properties of the corrugated sandwich structure and explored the critical stress which is a key element for evaluating the cushioning properties based on theory and experiment. It is convenient to evaluate the cushioning properties and optimize the corrugated sandwich structure. Simplifying the corrugated structure into the struts, and referring to the bending theory of the standard beam theory, we explored the evaluating equation of the critical stress for corrugated sandwich structure by the bending moment and Euler formulas. The critical stress is in direct proportion to the elastic modulus and the thickness of the basis material. It is also closely related to the length of the corrugated cell-wall and the pasted width between the corrugated cell-wall and the linerboard. Changing the above parameters, we can change the compression resistance of the corrugated sandwich structure. The theoretical value of the critical stress of the corrugated sandwich structure is higher than the experimental value, since the mechanical properties are lost when the basis material is manufactured into corrugated sandwiches and <b>corrugated</b> <b>boards.</b> Therefore, the lost coefficient is introduced into the theoretic equation which can not only help optimize and design the corrugated sandwich structure, but also find application in optimized design of cushioning pads of corrugated sandwich structure...|$|R
50|$|Based on this state-of-the-art, the {{objective}} of the project was to modify and thus improve the characteristics of different types of recovered fibres used for the production of a variety of packaging grade papers used as linerboard and corrugating medium for <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> manufacturing in Europe. Information on the actual furnish characteristics and composition of packaging materials is expected to help European packaging industry to evaluate its sources of supply and to adopt suitable methods and processes to improve the available resources in an optimal manner. In the case of packaging, scientific technical knowledge of practical industrial relations between fibre characteristics, paper properties and <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> properties also is needed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Corrugated</b> <b>board</b> {{adhesives}} are {{the next}} largest application of non-food starches globally. Starch glues are mostly based on unmodified native starches, plus some additive such as borax and caustic soda. Part of the starch is gelatinized {{to carry the}} slurry of uncooked starches and prevent sedimentation. This opaque glue is called a SteinHall adhesive. The glue is applied on tips of the fluting. The fluted paper is pressed to paper called liner. This is then dried under high heat, which causes {{the rest of the}} uncooked starch in glue to swell/gelatinize. This gelatinizing makes the glue a fast and strong adhesive for <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> production.|$|E

50|$|Case milling was an {{important}} industry associated with fruit growing. It was valued because it provided a useful outlet for timber which would otherwise have no economic value. There was a high demand for fruit and vegetable cases in the immediate post-War period with case milling peaking in 1949. 45% of cases were manufactured for packaging fresh fruit {{but they were also}} used for a range of other foodstuffs and manufactured goods. By the early 1950s, <b>corrugated</b> fibre <b>board</b> containers, developed during World War II, began to compete with the traditional wooden cases and the latter experienced a steady decline in use. By 1955 - 56 there were still some 58 wooden case manufacturers in Queensland comprising mostly small firms. Some 40% of the case millers in Queensland also milled timber for other uses.|$|R
40|$|When {{resistance}} to the Mexican isolate of Cydia pomonella Granulovirus (CpGV-M) arose in several organic orchards in Germany in 2004 and 2005, the future of codling moth control became a serious concern of organic fruit growing. In 2006, a new virus isolate from Andermatt Biocontrol AG (Madex Plus) was first tested in two field trials in organic orchards on codling moth populations resistant against the Mexican isolate of CpGV. Madex Plus showed a better efficacy on these populations than Madex 3. However, larval mortality larvae seemed to be somewhat delayed. A very good effect was shown in population control. The number of larvae in <b>corrugated</b> card <b>board</b> belts was significantly reduced after treatment with Madex Plus. In addition to these trials, on-farm trials in all orchards concerned of the CpGV-M resistance were carried out.
