5|$|The 2010 {{fiscal year}} budget was $199.2million, an {{increase}} of $35million from 2009.

The city has given a few surveys for citizens to rate {{the quality of life}} and <b>city</b> <b>services.</b> The largest department in the city is the public works department with a budget of $36.7million.

5|$|The first mall to {{be opened}} in College Station, Post Oak is the largest mall within the Brazos Valley area. At its opening, it became the city's largest employer, and nearly doubled its city sales tax revenues. Though the mall {{generated}} additional traffic and added to the demand on <b>city</b> <b>services,</b> it also generated $1 million in annual sales tax revenue, $120,000 in property taxes, and a half-million in taxes for the city school district. It is credited with creating the first major impetus for growing economic and commercial developments for College Station, which previously lacked a major retail community. The mall generates over 75 percent of the area's retail sales through its approximately eleven million annual visitors. It remains the city's largest taxpayer and its second largest employer. It is also the top employer of the students of nearby Texas A University.|$|E
5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony for}} the new city hall was held on July 29, 2004, and construction began {{under the direction of}} contractor Lease Crutcher Lewis, who built the original city hall, the following month. During construction, inaccuracies and omissions in the design and problems with demolishing parts of the building led to delays and an over-run of $19.6 million, bringing the final budget to $121 million. The new city hall opened on February 21, 2006, and received praise for its use of wood panels and the concourse's terrazzo flooring. The city hall's lower two floors, including the concourse, service desks, and the city council chamber, are open to the public; the remaining five floors house offices for <b>city</b> <b>services.</b> The city hall was granted an American Institute of Architects Honor Award by the Seattle chapter, as well as an Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star award for energy efficiency.

5|$|The mall {{also added}} new burdens to <b>city</b> <b>services,</b> with {{building}} inspectors {{having to work}} overtime to inspect each store area as it was completed. While mall security was issued citation books so they could issue parking tickets directly, the city police still had to work double shifts to cover the traffic during the mall's opening weekend. Overall, the mall increased traffic on the Earl Rudder Freeway, and city traffic engineers noted it would cause more traffic backup. Traffic signals {{were added to the}} mall's main entrance, while long-term plans were made to both expand the freeway and add additional interchanges along Harvey. Traffic studies were implemented to study the traffic after the mall's opening to developed additional plans to mitigate issues. There were concerns that the mall would be the final blow to the downtown area of neighboring city Bryan, Texas, which was already suffering reduced business after the opening of smaller Manor East Mall and the Townshire shopping center, both within Bryan. Bryan city officials noted an immediate decrease in revenue due to Sears moving from Bryan to College Station, taking $50–100,000 of sales taxes with it. However, as a whole the city was hopeful that the mall would have benefits to the city in the form of increased city growth as a whole. The city planners felt it would only be a passing fad for local rural and lower-income families, who would still return to downtown Bryan due to its proximity.|$|E
