40|$|Background. The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the biochemical blood peculiarities and cytokine profile in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients depending on the form of hypothyroidism. Material and methods. The study involved 188 NAFLD patients (average age 53. 60 ± 12. 34 years). Among the examined individuals 44 of them had diagnosed hypothyroidism in addition <b>to</b> NAFLD (20 <b>patients</b> had subclinical form and 24 patients had manifest hypothyroidism). A comparison group consisted of 144 NAFLD <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> thyroid normal functional activity. The control group consisted of 45 healthy individuals represented by their age and gender similar <b>to</b> the <b>patients</b> of the studied groups. Biochemical blood parameters, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin- 10, leptin, adiponectin blood levels were investigated in the observed patients and healthy individuals. Results. Total lactate dehydrogenase blood activity in NAFLD <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> subclinical and manifest hypothyroidism was found to be 13. 5 % increased <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the NAFLD <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> normal functional activity of the thyroid gland (p =  0. 02 and p = 0. 01, respectively). Higher alkaline phosphatase blood activity by 12. 0 % (p =  0. 03) was recorded in NAFLD and manifest hypothyroidism <b>patients</b> as <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> intact thyroid gland. Leptin blood concentration in NAFLD <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> subclinical as well as manifest hypothyroidism was 35. 7 % and 72. 1 % increased <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> NAFLD <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> normal thyroid functional activity (p = 0. 04 and p =  0. 009, respectively). Adiponectin blood level in NAFLD <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> manifest hypothyroidism was 2. 1 lower (p = 0. 004) in comparison <b>with</b> NAFLD <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> thyroid normal functional activity and 50. 0 % lower (p = 0. 009) as <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the NAFLD <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> subclinical hypothyroidism. NAFLD and manifest hypothyroidism patients showed greater vertical size of the liver measured by midclavicular line on average by 9. 1 mm (p =  0. 004) as <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> NAFLD <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> unchanged thyroid gland functional activity and by 8. 6 mm (p = 0. 04) in comparison <b>with</b> the NAFLD <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> subclinical hypothyroidism. Conclusions. There were found higher total lactate dehydrogenase acti­vity and leptin blood level in NAFLD <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> subclinical and manifest hypothyroidism and higher alkaline phosphatase activity and lower adiponectin blood level in NAFLD <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> manifested hypothyroidism as <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> NAFLD <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> normal functional activity of the thyroid gland. A significant increase in liver vertical size measured by midclavicular line was observed in NAFLD <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> manifest hypothyroidism as <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> normal thyroid function or subclinical hypothyroidism...|$|R

30|$|Patients {{and methods}} This was a {{retrospective}} study on data prospectively collected (1).

Pa strains were considered multidrug resistant (MDR) if resistant to ≥ 1 agent in ≥ 3 categories of antibiotics; extensively drug resistant (XDR) if resistant to ≥ 1 or more agent {{in all but}} ≤ 2 categories of antibiotics and pan-drug resistant (PDR) if resistant to all antibiotics tested (2). <b>Patients</b> infected <b>with</b> susceptible (S) strains were <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> infected <b>with</b> MDR and XDR strains. In a second analysis, <b>patients</b> infected <b>with</b> a MDR or XDR strains (grouped together and therefore named R) were <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> infected <b>with</b> S strains.

50|$|Risk {{factors for}} VAP include {{underlying}} heart or lung disease, neurologic disease, and trauma, {{as well as}} modifiable risk factors such as whether {{the head of the}} bed is flat (increased risk) or raised, whether the patient had an aspiration event before intubation, and prior antibiotic exposure. Patients who are in the ICU for head trauma or other severe neurologic illness, as well as patients who are in the ICU for blunt or penetrating trauma, are at especially high risk of developing VAP. Further, patients hospitalized for blunt trauma are at a higher risk of developing VAP <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> penetrating trauma.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{its role}} in metabolism, {{respiratory}} quotient {{can be used in}} analysis of liver function and diagnosis of liver disease.

Patients having a npRQ < 0.85 show considerably lower survival rates as <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> a npRQ > 0.85. A decrease in npRQ corresponds to a decrease in glycogen storage by the liver. Similar research indicates that non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases are also accompanied by a low respiratory quotient value, and the non protein respiratory quotient value was a good indication of disease severity.|$|E

50|$|To assess cardiac {{structure}} and function, echocardiography {{is the most}} commonly available and utilized modality.

Radionuclide imaging {{can be used as}} a non-invasive test to detect myocardial ischemia. Cardiac MRI has also been used to evaluate patients with possible TIC. Late-gadolinium enhancement on cardiac MRI indicates the presence of fibrosis and scarring, and may be evidence of cardiomyopathy not due to tachycardia.
