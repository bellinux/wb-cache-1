50|$|Rationality means {{calculation}} of the most efficient means of accomplishing a particular end.

These tasks should be spliced into small portions requiring minimal training or knowledge to minimise costs and increase efficiency.

50|$|These two {{strands of}} Kalleberg’s scholarship—on the fit between persons and jobs and on work and inequality—were joined in his ongoing {{research}} program on transformations in employment relations, which are implicit or explicit contractual arrangements that specify the reciprocal expectations and obligations linking employers and employees. Employment relations encompass {{a wide range}} of phenomena—including work organization, governance, evaluation and rewards—and so the study of employment relations is central to numerous subjects in the social sciences, including the origins and maintenance of economic inequality and social stratification; the operation of labor markets; mechanisms of skill acquisition and career mobility; recruitment, selection, hiring and promotion processes; and the governance and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> activities within organizations. As the link between individuals and their employing organizations, employment relations provide a theoretical linchpin connecting multiple levels of analysis: macrostructures such as economic, political, legal and social institutions; mesoscopic (middle-range) aspects of work groups, firms and inter-firm networks; and micro-level features of employment including individual work experiences and rewards.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Transitioning to Digital COW== A {{solution}} to these challenges is transitioning to an integrated, digital <b>Control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Work</b> solution. First of all, COW systems {{are all about}} communicating relevant information (such as hazards and controls, roles, and responsibilities) to all personnel involved. Using a digital solution allows users to more easily access and share this information with necessary stakeholders, {{as well as to}} continually be aware of changes. Secondly, possible conflicts between permits are now flagged and managed automatically, reducing or even mitigating the possibility of conflicting work occurring. Thirdly, digital COW providers offer functionality to visually represent permits on a graphical overview in the control room, greatly increasing situational awareness and knowledge of what is being done where. [...] However, what makes these solutions even more powerful, is integration with existent critical IT systems. For example, the COW software can pull maintenance information (such as equipment trees and work orders) from leading Maintenance Management and Enterprise Resource Planning systems to streamline PTW processes and ensure the correct equipment and location information is included in permits, risk assessments and isolation plans. Also, live plant data can be integrated into the PTW process through connections with Plant Information systems, giving the user real-time insight into various critical data points. Furthermore, integration with planning solutions such as Oracle Primavera allow for smart and adaptive planning of shutdowns and turnarounds. [...] Using an integrated and connected COW solution enables companies to leverage various data into their most important maintenance processes, enabling major increases in Hands on Tool Time, improving the quality of work, reducing risk, bolstering situational awareness and streamlining procedures.|$|E

Workflow {{management}} systems facilitate the everyday operation of business processes by {{taking care of}} the logistic <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> In contrast to traditional information systems, they attempt to support frequent changes of the workflows at hand. Therefore, the need for analysis methods to verify the cor-rectness of workflows is becoming more prominent. In this chapter we present a method based on Petri nets. This analysis method exploits the structure of the Petri net to find potential errors {{in the design of the}} workflow. Moreover, the analysis method allows for the compositional verification of workflows. ...|$|E
