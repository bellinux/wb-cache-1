5000|$|The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms {{contended that}} the mere {{possession}} of a pistol having a barrel less than sixteen inches (406 mm) long, a shoulder stock, and a rifle-length (more than sixteen inches) barrel constituted <b>constructive</b> <b>intent</b> to [...] "make" [...] an illegal short-barreled rifle (SBR) (by combining the pistol's frame, the pistol-length barrel, and the shoulder stock) even if the shoulder stock {{was intended to be}} used only with the rifle-length barrel.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, Wright J {{observed}} that {{since there was}} no physical touching there could be no grounds for a claim in battery, and as Mrs. Wilkinson did not apprehend any immediate physical violence, no claim would lie in common law assault. He gave three requirements for an action in mental shock. First, there must be conduct that is outrageous or extreme. Second, there must be actual or <b>constructive</b> <b>intent</b> to cause psychological harm. Third, the victim must suffer from actual harm resulting from the defendant's conduct.|$|E
3000|$|... “If you see something, say something.” This idea appears simple, yet, in many organizations, {{speaking}} up about something that causes concern {{is far from}} being perceived as simple. The term employee voice refers to informal and discretionary communication by an employee regarding ideas, suggestions, concerns, or opinions about work-related issues to superiors who might be able to take appropriate action. The intent is to bring about improvement or change (Detert and Burris 2007; Fast et al. 2014; LePine and Van Dyne 1998; Morrison 2011; Tangirala and Ramanujam 2008). It is a form of extra-role upward communication behavior that, albeit <b>constructive</b> in <b>intent,</b> challenges and seeks to alter the status quo (Dyne et al. 2003). Employee voice has been associated with organizational learning, improved work processes, innovation, error correction, the curtailment of illegal or immoral behavior, and crisis prevention (Detert and Edmondson 2011; Detert and Treviño 2010; Grant 2013; LePine and Van Dyne 2001; Liang et al. 2012; Morrison and Milliken 2000; Tangirala and Ramanujam 2008, 2012).|$|R
40|$|Public {{awareness}} of {{the negative impact of}} bullying on adolescents has increased due to social networking and news media reports. Prior research on bullying has focused on the prevalence of bullying in public schools, yet few studies have explored teacher <b>intent,</b> <b>constructive</b> or punitive, and teacher involvement in incidents of bullying. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine teacher intent and teacher involvement in responding to student bullying. The conceptual framework was based on Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s social learning theory and Marshall et al. 2 ̆ 7 s conceptual model of teacher intent and involvement. The central research question asked how teacher intent and involvement are impacted by state, district and school antibullying policies. This multiple case study included two middle schools, one in the Pacific region and one in the Midwest region of the United States. Participants in each case included 3 Grade 7 and 3 Grade 8 teachers. Data were collected from multiple sources, including teacher interviews, reflective journals, and state, district, and school documents. Single case analysis involved open and axial coding and category construction. Cross-case analysis involved the constant comparative method to determine emerging themes and discrepancies. Key findings indicated that state and district policies and procedures positively impact teacher intent and involvement. Teacher participants reported their intent to follow school procedures by responding to bullying incidents with constructive interventions to resolve conflicts. Teacher involvement was constructive and direct. This study contributes to positive social change by providing educators and policymakers with a deeper understanding of how to promote learning environments free from intimidation and violence...|$|R
5000|$|It {{would be}} incongruous to limit a wrong-doer’s <b>constructive</b> <b>intent</b> to {{cases where the}} result which he had {{foreseen}} was likely to cause death and not to infer such intent where the result he had foreseen was, although possible, not likely.It is only in proving the wrongdoer’s appreciation of death as a possible result that it becomes relevant whether death was [...] "likely" [...] for the more likely death was, the stronger is the inference that he in fact appreciated the risk to life.|$|E
5000|$|The word “constructive” {{is one of}} the law’s {{most useful}} frauds. It implies {{substance}} where none exists. There can be constructive contracts, constructive trusts, constructive fraud, <b>constructive</b> <b>intent,</b> constructive possession, and constructive anything else the law chooses to baptize as such. “Constructive” in this sense means “treated as.” ... Constructive treason wasn’t “real” treason but a vaguely defined, less potent category of conduct that the court deciding the particular case felt should be “treated as” treason. It was the perfect instrument of oppression, being virtually whatever the authorities wanted it to be.|$|E
