This update {{includes}} a new grille, tail lamps, dashboard design, {{the use of}} <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmission,</b> replacing the 5-speed automatic one, and also introduced the new trim line, RS, which replaced Sports as the top-level trim.|$|E
50|$|The Amaze was updated in May 2016. This update {{includes}} a new grille, dashboard design, {{which are the}} same as the Brio, new taillights, and the use of <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmission,</b> replacing the 5-speed automatic one. The engine remains the same. Similar to the previous model, both the engines use the same 5-speed manual transmission, while the CVT is offered on the gasoline variant only.|$|E
50|$|A {{magnetic}} <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmission</b> {{system was}} {{developed at the}} University of Sheffield in 2006 and later commercialized. mCVT is a variable magnetic transmission which gives an electrically controllable gear ratio. It {{can act as a}} power split device and can match a fixed input speed from a prime-mover to a variable load by importing/exporting electrical power through a variator path. The mCVT is of particular interest as a highly efficient power-split device for blended parallel hybrid vehicles, but also has potential applications in renewable energy, marine propulsion and industrial drive sectors.|$|E

The base engine in, say a midsize car or crossover SUV from a mainstream manufacturer, {{is usually a}} four-cylinder (inline-4) while the upgrade is a V6.

50|$|In an interview, Kohei Hitomi, {{the project}} leader of Fit hybrid, {{admitted}} that lowering CO2 further will affect some attributes that buyers {{of the car}} value: a bigger electric motor and battery sacrifice spaces utility, and improving aerodynamics might make side mirrors smaller. He said there are benefits for customers to keep all the versatility. The drivetrain is the same drive system as the Honda Insight. The advantages of the system are low cost, low weight and {{that it can be}} combined with either manual transmission or <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmission.</b> The car is better suited than its diesel competitors in areas where superminis are most common: city centres. It is more economical in urban conditions. Thanks to the instant torque of the electric motor, it has a much better engine response.|$|E
50|$|The LC 500h {{introduces}} the first Multi-Stage Hybrid system from Lexus, and its {{goal is to}} bring {{a new level of}} performance to hybrid technology. At the heart is the 8GR-FXS 3.5-liter, 24-valve, naturally aspirated V6 with dual intelligent variable valve timing, with 295 horsepower and 257 lb.ft of torque. The LC 500h also has an electric motor to boost power and improve efficiency — it’s the first Lexus to use lithium-ion batteries rather than a nickel-metal hydride battery. This new battery pack is 20% smaller and 44 lb lighter than the unit used in the LS 600h, meaning less weight and more efficient use of space. It fits between the rear seats and the trunk, and has 84 battery cells producing 310.8 volts. the power coming from the V6 and the electric motor are amplified through a four-speed automatic transmission embedded inside a <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmission.</b> This “dual” transmission provides stepped access to the torque generated by the electric motor, and recreates a 10-speed transmission with three virtual gears between each of the automatic transmission’s physical gears.|$|E
5000|$|Modern [...] "Semi-{{automatic}} transmissions" [...] {{usually have}} a fully automatic mode, where the driver {{does not need to}} change gears at all, operating {{in the same manner as}} a conventional type of automatic transmission by allowing the transmission's computer to automatically change gear if, for example, the driver were redlining the engine. The semi-automatic transmission can be engaged in manual mode wherein one can up-shift or down-shift using the console-mounted shifter selecter or the paddle shifters just behind the steering wheel, without the need of a clutch pedal. The ability to shift gears manually, often via paddle shifters, can also be found on certain automatic transmissions (manumatics such as Tiptronic) and <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmissions</b> (CVTs) (such as Lineartronic).|$|R
40|$|Wearable exoskeletons offer {{interesting}} possibilities {{to address}} the global concerns of the ageing society and hence many researchers and industries are investing significant resources to develop new innovations {{in the area of}} physical assistance. An important issue in providing effective physical assistance is how the needed torques can be generated efficiently and effectively. This paper considers this area and explores the use of <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmissions</b> (CVT) for up-grading/downgrading torques so that the torque variations for performing motions of normal daily living can be provided. The knee joint is focused upon to develop the key stages of the CVT based approach in generating motion torques. From our on-going research to developing assistive exoskeletons for support activities of daily living it has been found that 6. 3 – 20. 6  Nm torque is required to provide 10 – 20 % assistance at the knee joint of a healthy elderly person having weight 70 – 90  kg. The challenge here is to miniaturize conventional CVTs developed for the automobiles where large torques are needed. To achieve the required torque range for supporting human joints in various motions, a CVT is designed and its parameters optimized.
