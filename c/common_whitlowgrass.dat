50|$|Draba verna (syn. Erophila verna) {{may also}} {{go by the}} names spring draba, shadflower, nailwort, <b>common</b> <b>whitlowgrass,</b> vernal whitlow grass, early witlow grass or whitlow-grass. It is a small plant found in {{sagebrush}} country in the inland western United States, North Africa, temperate Asia, and most of Europe, including Britain. It was once {{thought to have been}} introduced to America from Europe, but is now considered native to both continents. It grows in very early spring. The flowers have four deeply notched white petals, and are borne an inch or two above the ground by a long stem. The leaves are clustered at the base.|$|E

Annuals are also characteristic of this habitat, including <b>common</b> <b>whitlowgrass</b> (Erophila verna), rue-leaved saxifrage (Saxifraga tridactylites,) hairy rock-cress (Arabis hirsuta) and the nationally scarce dwarf mouse-ear (Cerastium pumilum) and fine-leaved sandwort (Minuartia hybrida). A very local community characterised by a lichen-rich turf (Cladonia species) and the broom moss (Dicranum scoparium) is found in some stabilised missile-impaction craters on the central ranges. This vegetation type is found elsewhere only on Porton Down SSSI and on the Brecklands.|$|E
