60|$|At a table {{behind him}} sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and Mr. Chitling: all intent upon {{a game of}} whist; the Artful taking dummy against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling. The countenance of the first-named gentleman, peculiarly {{intelligent}} at all times, acquired great additional interest from his close observance of the game, and his attentive perusal of Mr. <b>Chitling's</b> hand; upon which, from time to time, as occasion served, he bestowed a variety of earnest glances: wisely regulating his own play by {{the result of his}} observations upon his neighbour's cards. It being a cold night, the Dodger wore his hat, as, indeed, was often his custom within doors. He also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth, which he only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the table, which stood ready filled with gin-and-water for the accommodation of the company.|$|R
