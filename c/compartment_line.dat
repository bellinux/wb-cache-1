40|$|Until {{some years}} ago, {{the bone marrow}} and the endothelial cell <b>compartment</b> <b>lining</b> the vessel lumen (subendothelial space) {{were thought to be}} the only sources {{providing}} vascular progenitor cells. Now, the vessel wall, in particular, the vascular adventitia, has been established as a niche for different types of stem and progenitor cells with the capacity to differentiate into both vascular and nonvascular cells. Herein, vascular wall-resident multipotent stem cells of mesenchymal nature (VW-MPSCs) have gained importance because of their large range of differentiation in combination with their distribution throughout the postnatal organism which is related to their existence in the adventitial niche, respectively. In general, mesenchymal stem cells, also designated as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), contribute to the maintenance of organ integrity by their ability to replace defunct cells or secrete cytokines locally and thus support repair and healing processes of the affected tissues. This review will focus on the central role of VW-MPSCs within vascular reconstructing processes (vascular remodeling) which are absolute prerequisite to preserve the sensitive relationship between resilience and stability of the vessel wall. Further, a particular advantage for the therapeutic application of VW-MPSCs for improving vascular function or preventing vascular damage will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the primordial pulmonary veins originate as an outgrowth of the atrial cells and anastomosis with the pulmonary venous plexus. As a consequence of this embryologic origin the tunica media of these vessels is composed of cardiac cells that express atrial specific markers (Lyons et al. [1990] J Cell Biol 111 : 2427 - 2436; Jones et al. [1994] Dev Dyn 200 : 117 - 128). We used transgenic mice for the cardiac troponin I (cTNI) gene and smooth muscle (SM) myosin heavy chain as differentiation markers, to analyze how cardiac and SM cells contribute to the formation and structural remodeling of the pulmonary veins during development. We show here that the tunica media of the adult mouse pulmonary veins contains an outer layer of cardiac cells and an intermediate SM cell <b>compartment</b> <b>lining</b> down on the inner endothelium. This structural organization is well expressed in the intrapulmonary veins from the beginning of vasculogenesis, with cardiac cells accumulating over preexisting roots of endothelial and SM cells and extending to the third bifurcation of the pulmonary branches without reaching the more distal tips of the vessels. On the other hand, SM cells, which are widely distributed in the intrapulmonary veins from the embryonic stage E 16, accumulate also in the extrapulmonary branches and reach the posterior wall of the left atrium, including the orifices of the pulmonary veins. This event takes place around birth when the pulmonary blood flow starts to function properly. A model {{for the development of the}} pulmonary veins is presented, based upon our analysis...|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the degree of}} host specificity of the purported anthropophilic and zoophilic populations of Anopheles vestitipennis. A series of experiments were conducted in an experimental hut with 3 <b>compartments</b> <b>lined</b> with nylon netting. A central release compartment and 2 side compartments were each baited with equivalent surface area of human and animal baits. Wild An. vestitipennis collected on each host, as well as corresponding F 1 mosquitoes, were released in the central compartment. Overall, 22 % (166 / 748) of all mosquitoes collected on humans were recaptured in the human compartment, whereas 23 % of mosquitoes originally collected on animals were recaptured in this compartment. Experiments with F 1 females resulted in 59 % human selection rates, a 2. 6 times increase compared with wild anthropophilic females, while a 1. 2 times decrease in human selection rates (from 24 % to 20 %) was observed in F 1 of wild zoophilic females. Host selection experiments in the Lacandón Forest revealed the same trend. These findings suggested that the complex mode of inheritance that resulted in female mosquitoes showing a stronger tendency {{to return to their}} preferred host was obscured {{by the nature of the}} method of collection, i. e., wild parental females selecting a host either innately or opportunistically, the majority of which were likely innately attracted.

Electron microscopy of sections from high-pressure frozen and freeze-substituted cells allowed {{a detailed description of}} exo- and endocytic structures located in the vesicle-rich, densely packed anterior part of the spindle-shaped cell. A complex of tubular clusters/translucent vesicles is the prominent structure between the trans-side of the single Golgi apparatus and the flagellar pocket, the only site of endo- and exocytosis. A tubulovesicular <b>compartment</b> <b>lined</b> by one or two distinct microtubules and extending {{along the length of the}} cell is proposed to be a post-Golgi and probably late endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Using biotinylation experiments, FACS analysis and quantitative immunoelectron microscopy it was found that, at comparable expression levels, 73 - 75 % of the two GPI-anchored proteins but only 13 % of the trans-membrane protein are located on the cell surface. The tubulovesicular compartment contains 46 %, the ER 5 %, the Golgi complex 1. 9 % and the tubular cluster/translucent vesicle complex 3. 6 % of the intracellular fraction of the GPI-anchored protease, GP 63. The density of GP 63 was found to be 23 -fold higher on the plasma/flagellar pocket membrane than on the ER and about tenfold higher than on membranes of the Golgi complex or of endo- or exocytic vesicles. These results indicate that there is a considerable concentration gradient of GPI-anchored proteins between the plasma/flagellar pocket membrane and the ER as well as structures involved in exo- or endocytosis. Possible mechanisms how this concentration gradient is established are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{physiological}} {{changes that}} sperm undergo {{in the female}} reproductive tract rendering them fertilization-competent constitute the phenomenon of capacitation. Cholesterol efflux from the sperm surface and protein kinase A (PKA) -dependent phosphorylation play major regulatory roles in capacitation, but the link between these two phenomena is unknown. We report that apolipoprotein A-I binding protein (AI-BP) is phosphorylated downstream to PKA activation, localizes to both sperm head and tail domains, and is released from the sperm into the media during in vitro capacitation. AI-BP interacts with apolipoprotein A-I, the component of high-density lipoprotein involved in cholesterol transport. The crystal structure demonstrates that the subunit of the AI-BP homodimer has a Rossmann-like fold. The protein surface has a large two <b>compartment</b> cavity <b>lined</b> with conserved residues. This cavity is likely to constitute an active site, suggesting that AI-BP functions as an enzyme.

40|$|AbstractThe {{organization}} of chromatin in the nucleus is nonrandom. Different genomic regions tend {{to reside in}} preferred nuclear locations, relative to radial position and nuclear <b>compartments.</b> Several <b>lines</b> of evidence support a role for chromatin localization in the regulation of gene expression [1 – 3]. Therefore, a key problem is how the {{organization of}} chromatin is established and maintained in dividing cell populations. There is controversy {{about the extent to}} which chromatin organization is inherited from mother to daughter nucleus [4 – 8]. We have used time-lapse microscopy to track specific human loci after exit from mitosis. In comparison to later stages of interphase, we detect increased chromatin mobility during the first 2 hr of G 1, and during this period association of loci with nuclear compartments is both gained and lost. Although chromatin in daughter nuclei has a rough symmetry in its spatial distribution, we show, for the first time, that the association of loci with nuclear compartments displays significant asymmetry between daughter nuclei and therefore cannot be inherited from the mother nucleus. We conclude that the organization of chromatin in the nucleus is not passed down precisely from one cell to its descendents but is more plastic and becomes refined during early G 1...|$|R

40|$|Sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) is an extra- and {{intracellular}} mediator {{that regulates}} cell growth, survival, migration, and adhesion in many cell types. S 1 P lyase is the enzyme that irreversibly cleaves S 1 P and thereby constitutes the ultimate step in sphingolipid catabolism. It {{has been reported}} previously that embryonic fibroblasts from S 1 P lyase-deficient mice (Sgpl 1 (-/-) -MEFs) are resistant to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis through upregulation of B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl- 2) and Bcl- 2 -like 1 (Bcl-xL). Here, we demonstrate that the transporter proteins Abcc 1 /MRP 1, Abcb 1 /MDR 1, Abca 1, and spinster- 2 are upregulated in Sgpl 1 (-/-) -MEFs. Furthermore, the cells efficiently sequestered the substrates of Abcc 1 and Abcb 1, fluo- 4 and doxorubicin, in subcellular <b>compartments.</b> In <b>line</b> with this, Abcb 1 was localized mainly at intracellular vesicular structures. After 16 h of incubation, wild-type MEFs had small apoptotic nuclei containing doxorubicin, whereas the nuclei of Sgpl 1 (-/-) -MEFs appeared unchanged and free of doxorubicin. A combined treatment with the inhibitors of Abcb 1 and Abcc 1, zosuquidar and MK 571, respectively, reversed the compartmentalization of doxorubicin and rendered the cells sensitive to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.
