50|$|In Euclidean geometry, a cyclic {{quadrilateral}} or inscribed quadrilateral is a quadrilateral whose vertices all lie on {{a single}} circle. This circle is called the circumcircle or circumscribed circle, and the vertices {{are said to be}} concyclic. The center of the circle and its radius are called the circumcenter and the circumradius respectively. Other names for these quadrilaterals are concyclic quadrilateral and <b>chordal</b> <b>quadrilateral,</b> the latter since the sides of the quadrilateral are chords of the circumcircle. Usually the quadrilateral is assumed to be convex, but there are also crossed cyclic quadrilaterals. The formulas and properties given below are valid in the convex case.|$|E
