In particular, we study the temperature dependence of the isospin-dependent bulk and single-particle properties, the mechanical and <b>chemical</b> <b>instabilities,</b> and liquid-gas phase transition in hot asymmetric nuclear matter. Our {{results indicate that the}} temperature dependence of the equation of state and the symmetry energy are not so sensitive to the momentum dependence of the interaction. The symmetry energy at fixed density is found to generally decrease with temperature and for the MDI interaction the decrement is essentially due to the potential part. It is further shown that only the low momentum part of the single-particle potential and the nucleon effective mass increases significantly with temperature for the momentum-dependent interactions. For the MDI interaction, the low momentum part of the symmetry potential is significantly reduced with increasing temperature. For the mechanical and <b>chemical</b> <b>instabilities</b> as well as the liquid-gas phase transition in hot asymmetric nuclear matter, our results indicate that the boundary of these instabilities and the phase-coexistence region generally shrink with increasing temperature and is sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy and the isospin and momentum dependence of the nuclear interaction, especially at higher temperatures.
