5000|$|As a result, James {{is forced}} {{to live with his}} two cruel aunts, Spiker and Sponge, in a {{run-down}} house on a high, desolate hill near the White Cliffs of Dover. For four years, James is treated as a drudge, forced to do hard labour, beaten for hardly any reason, improperly fed, and forced to sleep on bare floorboards in the attic. One summer afternoon, after a particularly upsetting altercation with his aunts, James stumbles across a mysterious stranger, who gives him magic green [...] "crocodile tongues" [...] which, when drunk with water, will bring him happiness and great adventures. On the way to the house, James spills the <b>crocodile</b> <b>tongues</b> onto a barren peach tree, which then produces a single peach that quickly grows to nearly the size of a house. The next day, the aunts sell tickets to neighbours and tourists to see the giant peach while James watches from the window of his room in which he is locked up, to prevent him from {{getting in the way of}} his aunts' business.|$|R
50|$|When night comes, {{the aunts}} release James {{and send him}} to collect rubbish {{discarded}} by the crowd. James went taking {{a closer look at}} the giant peach, but he discovers a tunnel, which leads to secret room inside the peach's seed, inhabited by a rag-tag band of human-sized, talking invertebrates (a old green grasshopper, centipede, earthworm, spider, ladybug, silkworm, and a glow-worm), also transformed by the magic of the <b>crocodile</b> <b>tongues</b> given him earlier. These bugs then become James' companions in his adventure, and the companionship is prompted by a common hatred of the aunts. Upon James' arrival, the Centipede bites through the stem of the peach, whereupon it rolls down the hill early next morning, crushing and killing Spiker and Sponge on the way. Everyone inside the peach feels it rolling over the aunts and bursts out cheering. It rolls through villages, houses, and a famous chocolate factory before falling off the cliffs at Dover into the sea. James and the bugs emerge to find themselves floating in the sea, but manage to sustain themselves on the delicious flesh of the peach. Hours later, near the Azores, the peach is surrounded by sharks. Using the Earthworm as bait, James and the others of the peach lure five hundred seagulls to the peach from the nearby islands, which they tie to the broken stem as a source of flight.|$|R

25|$|Like other archosaurs, {{crocodilians}} are diapsid, {{although their}} post-temporal fenestrae are reduced. The {{walls of the}} braincase are bony but lack supratemporal and postfrontal bones. Their tongues are not free, but {{held in place by}} a membrane that limits movement; as a result, crocodiles are unable to stick out their <b>tongues.</b> <b>Crocodiles</b> have smooth skin on their bellies and sides, while their dorsal surfaces are armoured with large osteoderms. The armoured skin has scales and is thick and rugged, providing some protection. They are still able to absorb heat through this armour, as a network of small capillaries allows blood through the scales to absorb heat. Crocodilian scales have pores believed to be sensory in function, analogous to the lateral line in fishes. They are particularly seen on their upper and lower jaws. Another possibility is that they are secretory, as they produce an oily substance which appears to flush mud off.|$|R
