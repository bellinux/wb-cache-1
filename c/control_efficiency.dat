40|$|SummaryDuring human pregnancy, placental trophoblasts {{differentiate}} and syncytialize into syncytiotrophoblasts {{that sustain}} progesterone production [1]. This process {{is accompanied by}} mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae remodeling [2], two facets of mitochondrial apoptosis, whose molecular mechanisms and functional consequences on steroidogenesis are unclear. Here we show that the mitochondria-shaping protein Optic atrophy 1 (Opa 1) <b>controls</b> <b>efficiency</b> of steroidogenesis. During syncytialization of trophoblast BeWo cells, levels of the profission mitochondria-shaping protein Drp 1 increase, and those of Opa 1 and mitofusin (Mfn) decrease, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae remodeling. Manipulation of the levels of Opa 1 reveal an inverse relationship with the efficiency of steroidogenesis in trophoblasts and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts where the mitochondrial steroidogenetic pathway has been engineered. In an in vitro assay, accumulation of cholesterol is facilitated in the inner membrane of isolated mitochondria lacking Opa 1. Thus, Opa 1 -dependent inner membrane remodeling <b>controls</b> <b>efficiency</b> of steroidogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Dual {{competition}} framework (DCF) {{posits that}} low-level threat may facilitate behavioral performance by influencing executive control functions. Anxiety {{is thought to}} strengthen this effect by enhancing threat’s affective significance. To test these ideas directly, we {{examined the effects of}} low-level threat and experimentally induced anxiety on one executive control function, the efficiency of response inhibition. In Study 1, briefly presented stimuli that were mildly threatening (i. e., fearful faces) relative to nonthreatening (i. e., neutral faces) led to facilitated executive <b>control</b> <b>efficiency</b> during experimentally induced anxiety. No such effect was observed during an equally arousing, experimentally induced happy mood state. In Study 2, we assessed the effects of low-level threat, experimentally induced anxiety, and individual differences in trait anxiety on executive <b>control</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Consistent with Study 1, fearful relative to neutral faces led to facilitated executive <b>control</b> <b>efficiency</b> during experimentally induced anxiety. No such effect was observed during an experimentally induced neutral mood state.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of demineralized water {{backwashing}} on fouling control of seawater ultrafiltration was investigated. Seawater from Scheveningen beach in The Hague and a desalination plant of Evides Company at Zeeland in the Netherlands was used as feed water, while demineralized water and UF permeate were used as backwash water for a fouling <b>control</b> <b>efficiency</b> comparison under different fluxes and backwash durations. Furthermore, demineralized waters with 5 or 50 mmol/l NaCl were applied for backwashing as well, to check the influence of monovalent cations on UF fouling control. Additionally, SWRO permeate was used for backwashes in long-term experiments to check the possibility of it replacing demineralized water. Results show that seawater UF fouling control is substantially improved by demineralized water backwashing. However, due to the high salinity of seawater, more water was required to dilute the cation concentration and limit the dispersion effect near the membrane surface than was needed for surface water. A 2 -min demineralized water backwash showed better fouling <b>control</b> <b>efficiency</b> than a 1 -min backwash. Furthermore, the presence of monovalent cations in the backwash water deteriorated the fouling <b>control</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the backwash, indicating {{the existence of a}} charge screening effect. The demineralized water with 5 and 50 mmol/l NaCl both showed a similar fouling <b>control</b> <b>efficiency</b> which is better than the UF permeate backwash. The calcium ions in UF permeate probably deteriorates the fouling <b>control</b> <b>efficiency</b> by maintaining a Ca-bridging effect between the membranes and NOM. SWRO permeate backwashing successfully controls membrane fouling as well. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} {{buffeting}} {{control of the}} Yangpu Bridge using a multiple tuned mass damper (MTMD) system is performed in this paper.

It is found that the <b>control</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the MTMD system is sensitive to its frequency characteristics, namely, the central frequency ratio and the frequency bandwidth ratio. On the other hand, the damping ratio of the TMDs has less significant effects on the <b>control</b> <b>efficiency.</b> A total of seven MTMD systems with different mass ratios are designed. Each one of these seven MTMD systems can be used for the buffeting control of the Yangpu Bridge, depending on the required <b>control</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the available budget.
