5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and <b>could</b> <b>touch</b> on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E
5|$|Towers {{scored the}} first Welsh try, which was {{converted}} by Jim Webb. The Natives {{replied with a}} spirited run by Ellison, but he failed {{to break through the}} Welsh defence. The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a breakaway try frrm the half-way line, which went some way to silence the heckles from the crowd. Webb, playing in out of position at full-back, missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark. The Natives continued to push, with Elliot coming within five-yards of the try line, and when Ellison did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25-yard line before he <b>could</b> <b>touch</b> down. In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander Bland dribbled the ball into the Natives' 25; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls, who managed to get the ball across the try line, allowing Jim Hannan to score. Warbrick for the Natives and Stadden for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries, but there were no further scores in the game.|$|E
5|$|The main rivalry {{heading into}} New Year's Revolution was between John Cena and Umaga over the WWE Championship. The rivalry all {{began on the}} November 6 episode of Raw, one of WWE's main {{television}} programs, when Cena interfered in Umaga's match while accepting a challenge to a match by Kevin Federline. One week later, Jonathan Coachman, an on-screen authority figure of Raw, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, announced that a match between Cena and Umaga would take place, which ended in a no-contest due to interference. Three weeks later on the November 27 edition of Raw, Umaga (through Armando Alejandro Estrada) issued a challenge to Cena for the WWE Championship, which Cena accepted. The following week, Cena was assaulted by Umaga after his match, and both were confronted by security. Afterwards, neither of them <b>could</b> <b>touch</b> each other outside of a match until New Year's Revolution. On the December 18 edition of Raw, Cena, along with D-Generation X, (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) faced off against Umaga and Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton). The match ended in a no-contest after Cena and Umaga started brawling to the backstage area. Two weeks later on the January 1 edition of Raw, Cena faced off against Federline in a No Disqualification match, a match {{where there is no}} rules {{and the only way to}} win is by pinfall or submission. During the match, Umaga came to the ring and hit Cena with the WWE championship belt, which allowed Federline to pin Cena for the win. This led to a 4-on-1 handicap match later that night between Johnny Nitro, Johnathan Coachman, Umaga, and Estrada and Cena, where Cena attacked Umaga with a folding chair, causing the disqualification.|$|E

25|$|Both of the lovers' fates are {{interwoven}} {{yet they}} deceive {{the other in}} a fight for dominance that Cleopatra wins for a while as the audience and other characters throughout the play know completely {{what is going on in}} the play filled with dramatic irony. Enobarbus once again knows of Antony's unrelenting attachment to Cleopatra and Cleopatra's mind games while the audience knows Cleopatra isn't dead as Antony kills himself over her. They both spent their whole lives trying to achieve higher fame than the other and became notorious for their lust. They are their own Gods and live separate from those that they call normal and watch. The play progresses into the protagonists decline in fame, leaving them to pursue a sure way into that immortality they coveted. They become immortals in death along with even more fame and has as well achieved their goal from the beginning. They die in the name of their love when they really die in the name of fame. A status of nobility higher than us and pity for the tragedy that is their relationship. The tragedy is Antony and Cleopatra's own happy ending as death was a small price to pay to become real gods. They proved that the only death that <b>could</b> <b>touch</b> them were by their own hand, further increasing that godly power they received from the people. Now they are apart from those they watched, now they are above them, and now they will be worshipped as gods.|$|E
500|$|Richardson was {{not known}} for his {{political}} views. He reportedly voted for Winston Churchill's Conservative party in 1945, {{but there is little}} other mention of party politics in the biographies. Having been a devoted Roman Catholic as a boy, he became disillusioned with religion as a young man, but drifted back to faith: [...] "I came to a kind of feeling I <b>could</b> <b>touch</b> a live wire through prayer". [...] He retained his early love of painting, and listed it and tennis in his Who's Who entry as his recreations.|$|E
500|$|The {{family of}} Brandon Teena criticized Swank for her {{repeated}} {{use of the}} male gender pronoun [...] "he" [...] in her Oscar acceptance speech. Teena's mother JoAnn Brandon said her child's transgenderism was a defense mechanism that was developed in response to childhood sexual abuse, rather than being an expression of Teena's gendered sense of self. She said, [...] "She pretended she was a man so no other man <b>could</b> <b>touch</b> her". Despite the criticism, Kevin Okeefe, writing for Out, defended Swank's acceptance speech; he said, [...] "Swank deserves {{a place in the}} great acceptance speech canon for being bold, not only as an actress, but as an award winner".|$|E

500|$|Jansch's music, and {{particularly}} his acoustic guitar playing, have influenced {{a range of}} well-known musicians. His first album (Bert Jansch, 1965) was much admired, with Jimmy Page saying, [...] "At one point, I was absolutely obsessed with Bert Jansch. When I first heard that LP, I couldn't believe it. It was so far ahead of what everyone else was doing. No one in America <b>could</b> <b>touch</b> that." [...] The same debut album included Jansch's version of the Davy Graham instrumental [...] "Angie." [...] This was a favourite of Mike Oldfield, who practised acoustic guitar alone as a child, and was then heavily influenced by Jansch's style. The title of the instrumental inspired Oldfield to call his first band (with sister Sally) The Sallyangie.|$|E

Writing for PopMatters that year, David Medsker said that Revolver showed the four band members [...] "peaking at the exact same time", and he deemed it to be [...] "the best of the bunch, the letter that went unanswered" [...] among a series of reciprocally influential musical statements exchanged between the Beatles and the Beach Boys over 1965–67. In a 2007 appraisal of the band's albums, Henry Yates of Classic Rock magazine paired it with Sgt.

Writing in Paste, Mark Kemp says that the album [...] "completed [...] transformation from the mop tops [...] of three years earlier into bold, groundbreaking experimental rockers", while Paul Du Noyer, in a review for Blender, said that it marked the group's arrival as [...] "psychedelic gurus" [...] and was a work in which the Beatles [...] "revolutionized their own style and rock music itself ... with the boldest innovations of the band’s career".|$|E

500|$|The 8th Brigade reserve battalion, Le Régiment de la Chaudière, began {{deploying}} to {{the beaches}} at 08:30 {{along with the}} reserve companies of the North Shore and QOR.

The Commandos were to pass Saint-Aubin's eastern edge and occupy Langrune-sur-Mer on the eastern end of Juno.
