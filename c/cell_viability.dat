Examinations of the rapidly reproducing Epstein–Barr B-cells showed that the cells lost viability within minutes when exposed to pilosulin 1. Normal white blood cells were also found to alter easily when exposed to pilosulin 1. However, partial peptides of pilosulin 1 were less efficient at lowering cell viability; the residue 22 N-terminal plays a critical role in the cytotoxic activity of pilosulin 1.|$|E

25|$|It is well {{established}} that the macromolecular structure of nonviral gene delivery vectors alters their transfection efficacy and cytotoxicity. The cyclized structure has been proven to reduce cytotoxicity and increase circulation time for drug and gene delivery applications. The unique structure of cyclizing chains provides the single chain cyclized polymers a different method of interaction between the polymer and plasmid DNA, and results in a general trend of higher transfection capabilities than branched polymers. Moreover, {{due to the nature}} of the single chain structure, this cyclized polymer can “untie” to a linear chain under reducing conditions. Transfection profiles on astrocytes comparing 25 kDa-PEI, SuperFect® and Lipofectamine®2000 and cyclized polymer showed greater efficiency and <b>cell</b> <b>viability</b> whilst maintaining neural <b>cell</b> <b>viability</b> above 80% four days post transfections.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} analyze a unicellular-multicellular {{evolutionary}} transition, a multi-cellular organism is {{identified with the}} vector of viabilities and fecundities of its constituent cells. The Michod–Viossat–Solari–Hurand–Nedelcu index of group fitness for a multicel-lular organism {{is a function of}} these <b>cell</b> <b>viabilities</b> and fecundities. The MVSHN index has been used to analyze the germ-soma specialization and the fitness decoupling between the cell and organism levels that takes place during the transition to multicellularity. In this article, social choice theory is used to provide an axiomatic characterization of the group fitness ordering of vectors of <b>cell</b> <b>viabilities</b> and fecundities underlying the MVSHN index...|$|R
25|$|Viral vectors were {{originally}} developed {{as an alternative}} to transfection of naked DNA for molecular genetics experiments.

This liquid-based template can be dynamically reconfigured {{in a few}} seconds, and the assembly on the template can be achieved in a scalable and parallel manner. Assembly of microscale hydrogels, cells, neuron-seeded micro-carrier beads, cell spheroids into various symmetrical and periodic structures was demonstrated with good <b>cell</b> <b>viability.</b> Formation of 3D neural network was achieved after 14-day tissue culture.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol, {{from the}} Ancient Greek chole- (bile) and stereos (solid) {{followed}} by the chemical suffix -ol for an alcohol, is an organic molecule. It is a sterol (or modified steroid), a type of lipid molecule, and is biosynthesized by all animal cells, {{because it is an}} essential structural component of all animal cell membranes; essential to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity. Cholesterol enables animal cells to dispense with a cell wall (to protect membrane integrity and <b>cell</b> <b>viability),</b> thereby allowing animal cells to change shape rapidly and animals to move (unlike bacteria and plant cells, which are restricted by their cell walls).|$|E
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that 50 % {{decrease}} of CCRF-CЕM <b>cells</b> <b>viability</b> (IC 50) was detected at 72  h under the action of HL in 10  μM concentration (Fig. 5). Recently, we have shown that another CAPh representative dimorfolido-N-trichloracetylphosphorylamid caused 50 % decrease of CCRF-CЕM <b>cells</b> <b>viability</b> at 72  h in concentration 1  mM [16]. The comparative analysis of these data demonstrates that introduction of phenoxy instead of morfolido groups into the structure of CAPh derivative allowed to decrease by two orders its effective toxic concentration against leukemic cells. We assume that conformational flexibility of –P(O)(OC 6 H 5) core ensured more effective interaction of this compound with DNA.|$|R

25|$|A {{counting}} chamber,(also {{known as}} hemocytometer), is a microscope slide that is especially designed to enable cell counting. The hemocytometer has two gridded chambers in its middle, which {{are covered with}} a special glass slide when counting. A drop of cell culture {{is placed in the}} space between the chamber and the glass cover, filling it by capillarity. Looking at the sample under the microscope, the researcher uses the grid to manually count the number of cells in a certain area of known size. The separating distance between the chamber and the cover is predefined, thus the volume of the counted culture can be calculated and with it the concentration of cells. <b>Cell</b> <b>viability</b> can also be determined if viability dyes are added to the fluid.|$|E
25|$|Apoptosis. During {{programmed}} {{cell death}} the ICE/ced-3 family of proteases (one of the interleukin-1β-converter proteases) degrade actin into two fragments “in vivo”; one of the fragments is 15 kDa and the other 31 kDa. This {{represents one of the}} mechanisms involved in destroying <b>cell</b> <b>viability</b> that form the basis of apoptosis. The protease calpain has also been shown to be involved in this type of cell destruction; just as the use of calpain inhibitors has been shown to decrease actin proteolysis and the degradation of DNA (another of the characteristic elements of apoptosis). On the other hand, the stress-induced triggering of apoptosis causes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (which also involves its polymerization), giving rise to structures called stress fibers; this is activated by the MAP kinase pathway.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial ABC {{transporters}} {{are essential}} in <b>cell</b> <b>viability,</b> virulence, and pathogenicity. Iron ABC uptake systems, for example, are important effectors of virulence. Pathogens use siderophores, such as Enterobactin, to scavenge iron {{that is in}} complex with high-affinity iron-binding proteins or erythrocytes. These are high-affinity iron-chelating molecules that are secreted by bacteria and reabsorb iron into iron-siderophore complexes. The chvE-gguAB gene in Agrobacterium tumefaciens encodes glucose and galactose importers that are also associated with virulence. Transporters are extremely vital in cell survival such that they function as protein systems that counteract any undesirable change occurring in the cell. For instance, a potential lethal increase in osmotic strength is counterbalanced by activation of osmosensing ABC transporters that mediate uptake of solutes. Other than functioning in transport, some bacterial ABC proteins are also involved in the regulation of several physiological processes.|$|E

25|$|Degree of {{acetylation}} (DA) for soluble chitosan {{ranges from}} 0% to 60%, depending on processing conditions. A {{study was conducted}} to characterize how varying DA affects the properties of chitosan. Varying DA was obtained using acetic anhydride or alkaline hydrolysis. It was found that decreasing acetylation created an increase in compressive strength. Biodegradation was examined by use of lysozyme, which is known to be mainly responsible for degrading chitosan in vivo by hydrolyzing its glycosidic bonds and is released by phagocytic cells after nerve injury. The results reveal that there was an accelerated mass loss with intermediate DAs, compared with high and low DAs over the time period studied. When DRG cells were grown on the N-acetylated chitosan, <b>cell</b> <b>viability</b> decreased with increasing DA. Also, chitosan has an increasing charge density with decreasing DA, which is responsible for greater cell adhesion. Thus, controlling the DA of chitosan is important for regulating the degradation time. This knowledge could help {{in the development of a}} nerve guidance conduit from chitosan.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the tail's ability to {{function}} as a proprioceptive sensor/modulator has also been investigated. As aforementioned, the tail demonstrates a high degree of muscularization and subsequent innervation that ostensibly collaborate in orienting the organism. Specifically, this is accomplished by coordinated flexion and extension of tail muscles to produce slight shifts in the organism's center of mass, orientation, etc., which ultimately assists it with achieving a state of proprioceptive balance in its environment. Further mechanobiological investigations of the constituent tendons in the tail of the rat have identified multiple factors that influence how the organism navigates its environment with this structure. A particular example is that of a study in which the morphology of these tendons is explicated in detail. Namely, <b>cell</b> <b>viability</b> tests of tendons of the rat's tail demonstrate a higher proportion of living fibroblasts that produce the collagen for these fibers. As in humans, these tendons contain a high density of golgi tendon organs that help the animal assess stretching of muscle in situ and adjust accordingly by relaying the information to higher cortical areas associated with balance, proprioception, and movement.|$|E
25|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{group of}} researchers led by Prof. Amy Shen, developed a novel cryopreservation method {{that helps to}} protect pancreatic islets from ice damage, and facilitates real-time assessments of <b>cell</b> <b>viability.</b> The novel technique employs a droplet microfluidic device to encapsulate pancreatic islets in hydrogel made of alginate, a natural polymer extracted from seaweed. These capsules have a unique microstructure: a porous network and considerable amount of non-freezable water. Non-freezable bound water does not form ice due to the strong association between water molecules and the hydrogel networks. Hydrogel capsules with large amounts of non-freezable bound water protect the cells from the ice damage and {{reduce the need for}} cryoprotectants—special substances that minimise or prevent freezing damage and can be toxic in high concentrations. The hydrogel capsule allows small molecules, e.g. nutrients and islet secretions, to pass through the membrane easily, but prevents direct contact between implanted cells and host cells and so prevent an attack on transplants by the autoimmune response. The use of a real-time single-islet oxygen sensor – a fluorescent oxygen-sensitive dye in hydrogel capsules allows to use a simple and cheap yet reliable individual-islet-based quality control of viability for the entire islet processing procedure prior to transplantation. Fluorescence indicates whether cells are consuming oxygen and, therefore, are alive and healthy.|$|E

500|$|KIF11 (also {{known as}} kinesin-5 and Eg5) is a homotetramer which cross-links anti-parallel microtubules in the mitotic spindle to {{maintain}} spindle bipolarity.

40|$|Hypoxic {{preconditioning}} {{can play}} a significant neuroprotective role. However, {{it has not been}} employed clinically because of safety concerns. To find a safer preconditioning stimulus that is both practical and effective, we investigated whether ginkgolides are capable of preconditioning as hypoxia to protect C 6 cells against ischemic injury. We demonstrated that both ginkgolides (37. 5 mu g/mL) and hypoxia (1 % O- 2 for 16 h) can significantly increase <b>cell</b> <b>viabilities</b> and expression of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase (p-GSK), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 alpha (HIF- 1 alpha) and erythropoietin (EPO) in ischemic cells. The inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or phosphatidylinositol 3 '-kinase (PI 3 K) significantly but not completely reduced the enhanced expression of these proteins and <b>cell</b> <b>viabilities</b> induced by ginkgolides and hypoxic preconditioning. These indicated that ginkgolides could mimic hypoxic preconditioning by increasing expression of HIF- 1 alpha as well as its target protein EPO and that the ginkgolides and hypoxic preconditioning role might be partly mediated by the activation of the p 42 /p 44 -rnitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3 '-kinase/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta. pathways. The similar tendency in the changes of protein expression, <b>cell</b> <b>viabilities</b> and responses to MAPK or PI 3 K inhibitors of the cells treated with ginkgolides and hypoxia suggests that ginkgolides and hypoxic preconditioning might operate by similar mechanisms.
