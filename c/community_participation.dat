40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{demographic}} characteristics, background experiences and environmental influences for their ability to predict college <b>community</b> service <b>participation.</b> Additional analyses looked at college <b>community</b> service <b>participation</b> to determine in what type of service students were participating and for how long. Astin's Inputs-Environments-Outcomes (1991, 1993) conceptual model provided the framework for how the variables were entered into a logistic regression analysis. A logistic regression analysis was chosen because the outcome, college <b>community</b> service <b>participation,</b> was measured as a dichotomous variable. Data from the Multi-Institutional Study of Leadership were used to answer the research questions. Results from the logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the proposed set of predictors significantly increased the odds of predicting <b>community</b> service <b>participation</b> in college from 53. 1 % to 73. 2 %. Each of the seven blocks was significant, but the blocks that improved the fit most were the college involvement experiences, high school experiences and characteristics, and pre-tests. Of all significant predictors, frequency of volunteer work in high school, low college grades, participation in a Greek organization, participation in a service organization, involvement in college organizations or off campus organizations, and socially responsible leadership capacity were the strongest predictors of college <b>community</b> service <b>participation.</b> Additional analyses described the outcome variable, college <b>community</b> service <b>participation.</b> Out of the sample of 47, 230 students, 25, 059 or 53. 1 % indicated that they regularly participated in community service. Most students were participating in community service either through a student organization or on one's own instead of through class or federal work study. Also, students were generally participating in community service for less than 20 hours each term (67. 6 %), and less than 1 % of students were contributing more than 75 hours each term. Overall, the findings from this study support the notion that background characteristics and pre-college experiences alone do not predict college <b>community</b> service <b>participation.</b> A student's involvement while in college as well as socially responsible leadership capacity, both areas which interventions can be designed to address, greatly increase the likelihood of <b>participation</b> in <b>community</b> service...|$|R

The reasons include inappropriate design - pumps and inverters burned out - and the stealing of solar panels.
