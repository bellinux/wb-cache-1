50|$|Soy sauce (usually a mix {{of light}} and dark soy sauce), {{fermented}} bean paste, red fermented tofu or <b>caramelised</b> <b>sugar</b> is commonly used to give an appetising reddish brown hue and flavour to the items being cooked. Food coloring is sometimes added for a more intense red. Both lu and hongshao are forms of stewing or braising and are characterised by the use of soy sauce, Chinese rice wine (Shaoxing wine, huangjiu etc.) and <b>caramelised</b> <b>sugar.</b> Whole spices (star anise, black cardamom (caoguo), cassia, and/or fennel seeds) or five-spice powder are crucial elements in these dishes but are used in moderation so that their flavours do not overwhelm the main ingredients.|$|E

5000|$|Mild {{in modern}} times is {{generally}} considered to be a low-gravity beer with a low hop rate and predominantly malty palate. Historically, mild ales were of standard strength for the time (and rather strong by modern standards). Modern mild ales are mainly dark coloured with an abv of 3% to 3.6%, though there are lighter hued examples, as well as stronger more traditional examples reaching 6% abv and higher. The term 'mild' originally {{had nothing to do with}} strength or level of hop bitterness, but rather as a label for beers that were not [...] "vatted" [...] (aged) and hence did not have some of the tart and even slightly sour flavour of ales that were subject to long aging, which was considered a desirable attribute of premium ales.The dark colour characteristic of modern-day milds can come from either the use of roast malt or <b>caramelised</b> <b>sugars,</b> or more commonly, both. These ingredients lead to differences in flavour characteristics.|$|R

It is then {{carefully}} folded by the cook into a tall, conical shape and left to stand upright. Roti tissue may be served with curry gravy, dal and chutneys, or finished off with sweet substances such as <b>caramelised</b> <b>sugar</b> and eaten as a dessert.|$|E
50|$|In Macedonia moonshine is {{not only}} legal, but is also the liquor of choice, where it is called ракија (rakija). Typically, the moonshine {{is made out of}} grapes, which are the {{leftovers}} from the production of wine, but also made from plums (Slivovica). Moonshine is highly popular because it is commonly used for medicinal purposes. This process usually uses diluted moonshine with <b>caramelised</b> <b>sugar,</b> and the liquor is then boiled and consumed while still hot.|$|E
30|$|For {{cultures}} of A. niger AB 4.1, ΔxlnR, ΔclrA and ΔclrB strains, spores were washed with 0.01  % (v/v) Tween- 80 solution and 108 spore, in suspension were inoculated into 250  ml sterile Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100  ml AMM (Delmas et al. 2012) containing 1  % (w/v) glucose or ball-milled wheat straw (1  % w/v) (Delmas et al. 2012) and incubated for 48  h at 28  °C on a shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, St Albans, UK) set to 150  rpm. Media were autoclaved at 117  °C instead of 121  °C {{to limit the}} <b>caramelising</b> of <b>sugars.</b> For studies involving time-points, the A. niger strain used was grown in 1  % (w/v) glucose for 48  h before being washed and transferred to AMM supplemented with 1  % (w/v) of the carbon source and incubated further for 24 or 48  h. Supernatants were collected {{at each time point}} for enzymatic analysis.|$|R
50|$|Desserts or snacks {{are common}} and are eaten in between meals-often for morning tea and {{afternoon}} teas. Some common ones include pies filled with custard or pumpkin or pineapple. Steamed puddings are also common {{but these are}} rich in sugars and fats. Most homes would use coconut cream, <b>caramelised</b> <b>sugar</b> to give the color, flour, baking powder as the main ingredients. The pudding mixture is poured into tins and steamed for 1-2 hours. To improve the flavour, sometimes cinnamon or raisins are added. Some nice desserts are also made with cassava. Cassava is first grated and sugar is added. It is then wrapped in banana leaves and steamed. Burnt Sugar pudding (purini or pudini) is a favorite pudding in the Fijian cuisine. The historical existence is unknown, more than likely was introduced by the British, given their fondness for pastries and steamed puddings.|$|E

Ink and {{watercolour}} illustration showing two children buying animal shaped sweets from a street merchant who is creating {{them out of}} <b>caramelised</b> <b>sugar.</b> This {{is one of several}} watercolours showing cultural aspects from Manchuria. The United Presbyterian Church established a field there in 1872 when Dr John Ross developed stations from the port of Newchwang to the state capital of Moukden [Shenyang]. He also made inroads into Korea and translated the New Testament into Korean. ❧ The image is from an album associated with Rev. James A Whylie (1863 - 1894) who was ordained to the Manchuria mission in 1887 and based in Liaoyang, 1888 - 1894...|$|E
40|$|A {{novel and}} simple method for the rapid {{fabrication}} of microfluidic net-works is presented. A silicone elastomer (PDMS - poly(dimethylsiloxane)) is cured around formers, {{which are then}} removed post-cure, resulting in a microstructure suitable for fluidic applications. The limiting factors in the fabrication method are in the materials and tools used for the develop-ment of the formers. If the methods used cannot produce a structure of accurate di-mensions then the microstructure formed will be limited. For creating very narrow flu-idic channels, the material used needs to be strong so that even with narrow dimen-sions it can be removed without damage {{but the use of}} sacrificial materials has been investigated as this overcomes this re-quirement. The principle of the technique is demonstrated with an unusual material (<b>caramelised</b> <b>sugar</b> – which can be easily dissolved in water) to fabricate channels with diameters down to 16 ?m...|$|E
