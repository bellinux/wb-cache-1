40|$|This thesis {{traces the}} {{development}} of styles and theories of <b>cultural</b> <b>cooperation</b> from the pre-World War II models developed by France and Britain in particular, through the post-WWII international cooperation structures which included <b>cultural</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{as part of their}} structures. Organisations considered include the International Committee for Intellectual Cooperation, the Brussels Treaty Organisation, the Council of Europe and the European Union, focusing primarily on the non-educational or scientific aspects of <b>cultural</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Sources used include documentation of the two latter bodies and the public records of the UK Foreign Office and Ministry of Education. Intellectual cooperation was launched {{under the auspices of the}} League of Nations as a separate entity from the bilateral cultural relations of governments. Its tradition continues to be powerfully felt in the activity of the Council of Europe, after WWII the fulcrum of multilateral <b>cultural</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The thesis shows how it moved away from acting as a counterpoint to political developments towards the creation of a programme based on sociological study, which contained a strong element of federalist ideology, developing its own orthodoxy of "cultural policy", until partly "repossessed" in the 1990 s by political imperatives. The contrast with the tightly regulated European Union is marked, and shows in certain respects a return to earlier experiments in <b>cultural</b> <b>cooperation,</b> which developed most of its theory and practice in the pre- 1992 era when the Community Treaty did not provide for action in the field of culture. The thesis argues that the EU's cultural programme is not a manifestation of a "Europeanisation" of cultural policy, although policies elsewhere in the organisation may well have that effect, but of multilateral <b>cultural</b> <b>cooperation...</b>|$|R
