40|$|Genetically {{modified}} organisms (GMOs), e. g. viral vectors, {{could threaten}} the environment if by their release they spread hazardous gene products. Even in <b>contained</b> <b>use,</b> to prevent adverse consequences, viral vectors carrying genes from mammals or humans should be especially scrutinized {{as to whether}} gene products that they synthesize could be hazardous in their new context. Examples of such potentially hazardous gene products (PHGPs) are: protein toxins, products of dominant alleles that {{have a role in}} hereditary diseases, gene products and sequences involved in genome rearrangements, gene products involved in immunomodulation or with an endocrine function, gene products involved in apoptosis, activated proto-oncogenes. For <b>contained</b> <b>use</b> of a GMO that carries a construct encoding a PHGP, the precautionary principle dictates that safety measures should be applied on a “worst case ” basis, until the risks of the specific case have been assessed. The potential hazard of cloned genes can be estimated before empirical data on the actual GMO become available. Preliminary data may be used to focus hazard identification and risk assessment. Both predictive and empirical data may also help to identify what further information is needed to assess the risk of the GMO. A two-step approach, whereb...|$|E
30|$|Based on {{the results}} of this study, the use of mean values of {{cross-pollination}} over distance may result in an underestimation of gene flow. Where stringent control of gene flow is required, for example, for non-GM seed production or for GM field trials under <b>contained</b> <b>use,</b> the high values of cross-pollination should be used to determine isolation distance. However, this may not be practical in terms of the isolation distance required. We therefore suggest that temporal and distance isolations be combined, taking into account the GM maize pollen sources within the radius of the most stringent isolation distance required.|$|E

40|$|Georgian musical-folklore {{genres of}} the pre-Christian {{provenance}} bear one com-mon feature – {{it is very}} <b>contained</b> <b>use</b> of musical ornamentations or melismata {{and in most cases}} their complete negligence. The musical ornamentations of this period are at the rudimentary stage and their initial forms consist of the simplest inter-syllable extra-note singing. By its plain and simple character the ancient Georgian musical ornamentation can be compared with the decoration of the Trialeti Goblet (Amiranashvili, 1961; Chubinashvili, 1957). From the aesthetic point of view melismata, as an artistic means, seem to have been quite useless or less fit for the musical texture constructed on the principle of dying and resurrection. In my opinion, this phenomenon can have the following aes-thetic explanation: when the aesthetic cognition is orientated to the establishment of the ambivalent unity of death and life and the musical imagery is concentrated on bringing out the irreversibility of the infinite repetition of these two principles, it is quite clear that the emphasis is laid on the process of their intersection and mutual infiltration.

30|$|In this study, we have {{investigated}} the effect of pollen load and environment on cross-pollination under typical maize growing conditions in South Africa. We have also compared mean cross-pollination to high cross-pollination values over distance in order to calculate isolation distances for predetermined thresholds of commingling. Mean cross-pollination data may be sufficient to determine isolation distances where commingling is allowable at a specific threshold, for example, non-GM production. However, to achieve zero commingling for non-GM seed production, or GM field trials under <b>contained</b> <b>use,</b> a more stringent approach {{through the use of}} greater isolation distances based on high compared to mean cross-pollination may be required. While this may not be practical under all conditions, {{it would be possible to}} achieve maximum stringency through the combined use of temporal and distance isolations, taking into account the GM maize fields within the radius of the most stringent isolation distance required. Finally, comparing the results of this study to others, it is evident that while the overall trends may be similar between different cross-pollination studies, geographic specific data are required to establish isolation distances for a specific region.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The White Garden {{shows the}} most worked, formal and <b>contained</b> <b>use</b> of the {{language}} existing in the chasm between the conscious and the unconscious. This is the territory that the novel explores because the female characters adopt different personifications and they subvert the personalities of the women they stand for enjoying the status of deluded women. The boundary between the conscious, the symbolic order superimposed by Goddard, and the unconscious, the pre-Oedipal phase in which the dreams strive to appear from the subconscious {{in the privacy of}} the cell becomes the mainstay of the novel. The outcome of all this is a rich and profuse web of influences and cross-referencing; a transposition of systems of signs that results in a dense and complex relationship whose imagery is achieved by means of the white garden, a representation of female freedom and triumph. There has been a resurgence of women’s writing in Australia since the 1960 s and we can account for it {{in a number of ways}} since there was, first of all, the rise of feminism and an accompanying appreciation of women’s writing, then a proliferation of publishers and the appearance of women’s studies courses in universities that helped to promot...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to give {{a complex}} insight into the {{framework}} and problem questions arising in connection with legal regulation of genetically modified organisms (hereinafter referred as "GMOs"). As the use of GMOs is spreading it brings along many discussions regarding their positive and potential negative impacts on {{human health and the}} environment. After the introduction into the GMOs from the practical and technical point of view, the analysis of the underlying principle, the precautionary principle, follows. Different approaches to the risks connected with GMOs formed different views on construction and application of the precautionary principle and caused its uncertainty as to its position in international law. Significant part of the international law relating to the GMOs consists of soft law documents. The willingness of states to be bound by binding rules in this area is still lacking. The only exception is the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety focusing on the transboundary movement of GMOs. The Law of European Communities comprises of Regulations, Directives, and Recommendations. The law distinguishes following types of use: <b>contained</b> <b>use,</b> deliberate release of GMOs into the environment for any other purpose than for placing on the market, release of GMOs on the market and transboundary movement [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Lentiviral vectors (LV) are {{competent}} {{gene transfer}} vehicles, as used for both research and gene therapy applications, {{because of their}} stable integration in non-dividing and dividing cells and long-term transgene expression. Along with our understanding that LV offer solutions for gene therapy, biosafety concerns have uncovered risks due to insertional mutagenesis, the generation of replication competent lentiviruses (RCL) and vector mobilization. Researchers therefore continue to devote significant efforts in designing LV with improved efficacy and biosafety features. The choice of a particular LV system for experimental studies is often driven by functional considerations, including increased productivity and/or transduction efficiency. The design of safer vectors has also directly benefited researchers allowing them to conduct experimental studies with lower risk. Currently, vectors combine improved safety features (that decrease the risk of recombination and vector mobilization) with increased transduction efficiency. Hence, risks associated with the inadvertent transduction of cells of the investigator gain greater importance in assessing the overall risk of these vectors and become an important biosafety concern.

40|$|At {{the end of}} 2002, an {{outbreak}} of a new viral respiratory illness, called SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus), occurred in China. The disease spread over Asia, North America, Europe and Africa. In response to the SARS outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated an international collaboratorion that included clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory investigations, and initiated efforts to control the spread of SARS. As in other countries, Belgium has been decided to establish biosafety guidelines and recommendations with particular emphasis on handling clinical specimens associated with SARS for research, production, and clinical laboratories. Taking into account that there is so far no SARS case reported in Belgium {{as well as in}} other countries in the world, and based on a scientific risk assessment related to the <b>contained</b> <b>use</b> of biological agents, the SARS-CoV was classified as a Risk Group 3 agent. In relation to the reported biosafety assessment, the SARS-CoV should be handled in appropriate biosafety containment levels to avoid laboratory-acquired infections and spread of the disease in the human population and the environment. Therefore, diagnostics activities with inactivated clinical specimens associated with SARS cases and with specimens originating in countries where SARS is documented but associated with SARS cases should be performed under Biosafety Level 2 (BSL- 2) conditions. Diagnostic activities involving non activated clinical specimens associated with SARS should be carried out under biosafety BSL- 2 containment with BSL- 3 safety equipment and work practices.

40|$|Biosafety {{refers to}} the efforts taken in {{ensuring}} {{the safety of the}} application of biotechnology, which necessitates for proactive steps to be taken to “reduce and eliminate the potential risks resulting from biotechnology and its products”. Modern biotechnology has enabled scientists to genetically and biochemically modify plants, animals as well as microorganisms. In the effort to increase crop production for the purpose of securing global food supply, the application of biotechnology in the agricultural sector must be carried out in a safe and sustainable manner. The recognition of the potential risks to {{human health and the environment}} must not be discounted and countries looking towards the application of biotechnology must ensure its safe application. The need for further regulations on biosafety was discussed in 1992, when the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was adopted. Article 19 (3) of the Convention requires its members to consider the need for a protocol on “the safe transfer, handling and use of any living modified organism resulting from biotechnology that may have adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. ” This consequently led to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB), which primarily regulates the trans-boundary movement of living modified organisms (LMOs) or alternatively known as genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In Malaysia, the Biosafety Act 2007 (BSA) was passed to regulate the release, importation, exportation and <b>contained</b> <b>use</b> of GMOs in order to protect inter alia human, plant and animal health as well as the environment and biological diversity. This paper highlights the issues pertaining to liability and redress, which provides for the legal obligation to compensate the damage especially to the environment accruing from the trans-boundary movement of the GMOs, as well as the position of the present Malaysian biosafety law. </p...|$|E
