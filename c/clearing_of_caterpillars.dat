Through an embedding <b>of</b> <b>caterpillars</b> into ladders, we obtain an embedding <b>of</b> <b>caterpillars</b> into the hypercube. In this way we get almost all known results concerning the embedding <b>of</b> <b>caterpillars</b> into the hypercube. In addition we construct an embedding {{for some new}} types <b>of</b> <b>caterpillars.</b> Our results support the conjecture of Havel (1984) ...|$|R

40|$|Among the {{mechanisms}} that influence herbivorous insects, fires, a very frequent historical {{phenomenon in the}} cerrado, {{appear to be an}} important modifying influence on lepidopteran communities. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the richness, abundance, frequency, and composition <b>of</b> species <b>of</b> <b>caterpillars</b> in two adjacent areas of cerrado sensu stricto, one recently burned and one unburned since 1994, on the experimental farm “Fazenda Água Limpa” (FAL) (15 ∘ 55 ′S and 47 ∘ 55 ′W), DF, Brazil. Caterpillars were surveyed on two plant species, genus Erythroxylum: E. deciduum A. St. -Hil. and E. tortuosum Mart. (Erythroxylaceae). We inspected a total of 4, 196 plants in both areas, and 972 caterpillars were found on 13. 3 % of these plants. The number <b>of</b> plants with <b>caterpillars</b> (frequency) differed significantly between the areas. The results indicate that recent and accidental fires have a positive effect on the abundance <b>of</b> <b>caterpillars</b> up to one year postfire, increase the frequency <b>of</b> <b>caterpillars</b> associated with Erythroxylum species in the cerrado and do not affect the richness <b>of</b> <b>caterpillars</b> on these plants. Moreover, the fires change the species composition <b>of</b> <b>caterpillars</b> by promoting an increase in rare or opportunistic species...|$|R
