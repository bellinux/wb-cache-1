The constraints on control variables are introduced through penalty factors which expand the objective function, it is also assumed that the cable ampacity corresponds to a load factor of 0. 8.

In this master thesis two different techniques for placement of power cables are investigated using IEC- 60287.

40|$|Wind farm {{collector}} circuits generally comprise several {{wind turbine}} generators (WTG’s). WTG’s are connected in parallel to a substation. This connection acts as the point-of-connection to the national electricity grid. The electrical load in these circuits is close to component (power cables and accessories) ratings. The objective {{of this paper is}} to identify cable joint failure paths; and, develop an understanding of specific contributing factors. All findings presented were established from literature review involving data analysis and discussion with industry experts working across the wind industry. Application of forces, inadequate workmanship, incorrect thermal resistance or other contributing factors, all contribute to high conductor operating temperatures. High conductor operating temperatures highlight issues including insufficient environmental heat transfer due to the use of inadequate <b>cable</b> <b>trenching</b> materials. This in turn results in the imbalanced application of force, experienced at the cable joint, as a direct result of frequent thermal expansion and contraction. For most cable joint failures, the root cause is insulation breakdown due to sustained deterioration of the cross-linked polyethylene insulation. This is a direct result from excessive operating temperatures...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} the power {{transmission}} with normal-conducting low-temperature cables, especially the economic aspects, are {{worked out in}} detail. As useful cost-comparisons can only be done on optimised systems, studies on system-optimisation are most important. Calculations on the optimal temperature of the cryocable give the result, {{that there is a}} minimum of the costs of power loss (incl. investment-costs of the pefrigerators) around 25 K, but the complication of the conductors caused by the necessity of reducing skinand proximity-effect resul t in a displacement and nearly total elimination of the optimum. The costs of current-transportcannot be effectively lowered by deep cooling. The optimistic cost data of cryocables reported in the literature may be explained by the following arguments: - insulation of high-voltage can be done easier at low temperatures and allows a simpler design of the cable. - the power-limit of cryocables is much higher comparedwith conventional cables, thus the degression of specific cost typical for all types of cables can be utilizied. Some further criterions may be added which are not analysed concerning the costs in detail, for example low with of the <b>cable</b> <b>trench</b> related to the power rating, good overload capability, adaption to the growing load with low costs by extension of the cooling-stations (this argument applies especially to the liquid nitrogen ($LN_{ 2 }$) -cable). As cooling with liquid hydrogen gives no substantial cost advantages, only the $LN_{ 2 }$-cable is treated further on because this will be an easier and more reliable system. Two typical and especially promising concepts are investigated in detail - a single conductor tube-cable, which is electrically and thermally insulated by vacuurn - a three-conductor cable with litz-type conductors which is insulated electrically by wrapped paper impregnated with $LN_{ 2 }$ and thermally by superinsulation under vacuum. The investment-costs and capitalized running costs related to the length and the transmitted power of the optimized systems are calculated at a nominal voltage of 110 kV and shown in dependence of power and length. Cable and cooling station can be devided in parallel independent units to increase the reliability of the system. The oncost of this provision is determined. By the following investigations on further details the results are refined and especially some unsafe points are examined more closely. As conclusion an economic comparison is done between the investigated types of a cryocable and an advanced normal-temperature-cable, that is an artificially cooled $SF_{ 6 }$-cable. As this is done on a uniform basis, the result will surely have a high reliability. The comparison shows, that the $LN_{ 2 }$-vacuum-tubecable is not competitive with the advanced $SF_{ 6 }$-tube-cable within the whole region of power investigated. The $LN_{ 2 }$-litz-conductor-cable on the other hand is able to cornpete when power and length are high. This is especially true, if it can be shown that the estimation of the frabrication costs of the conductor has been too pessimistic. Therefore experimental research on losses and fabrication problems of litz-conductors with high cross-sections are very important. The results of such investigations will be decisive on the good chances of a cryocable development...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to find out whether {{technical}} or economic aspects justify the development of cryoresistive cables. Naturally cooled cables will not be able to transmit the amounts of power that will be in the future in the congestion areas. The installation of overhead lines or parallel conventional cables will not be possible because of the growing lack of space for the cable trenches. Consequently, the development of advanced-power-cables should already be started now. The solution of the problem, whether the use of a cable, especially of a cryocable, is technically and economically justified, depends on the construction of the cable, on the materials which are used, and on the cooling machinery. For economic reasons aluminium or perhaps copper will be the preferred material for the conductors. Thecooling liquid can be practically only liquid nitrogen. The study discusses six kinds of electrical insulations, three variations of the flow of the cooling medium, two possibilities for the arrangement of electrical and thermal insulation and some kinds of conductor constructions. Altogether there are 504 theoretical conceivable cable concepts. Taking certain selection criteria as basis, three principal concepts which promise the most success have been selected from these concepts. By furthervariation three definite cable concepts are obtained for one of the solutions, so that totally in this study five cable concepts are discussed in detail. The two cryocables which have been under development in the USA for some years now are included in these concepts. At a nominal voltage of 110 kV and 15 km distance between thecooling stations the limit is about 1000 to 1500 MVA, at 380 kV and the same distance about 4000 to 5000 MVA. At smaller distances the power limits are correspondingly higher. In addition for each cryocable concept the transmission costs per km cable length and per MVA power rating are determined in variation with the diameter of the cable, the distance between cooling stations and the transmitted power. The formula used for the costs takes into account the capital cost of the cable, termination and fitting costs, including installation, civil engineering, cooling stations and costs of power losses, i. e. the costs for the electrical losses in thecable and the energy costs for the cooling stations. All the costs are determined according to uniform criteria. The used cost-formula allows for the standard utility-load. The results show that at maximum load the capital costs of the cooling stations and the costs of power-losses yield the biggest contribution to the total costs. Whereas the cost of the cable itself can be determined relatively accurately, there are greater uncertainties with respect to the capital cost and the efficiency of the cooling stations because plants have not yet been built for such an application. The accuracy of the calculated transmission costs is therefore determined on the basis of these uncertainties. In order to make a comparison with conventional cables, the costs of conventional cables buried directly and in cooling-water-ducts were computed with the same formulas and the same assumptions as for cryocables. The limits of power tx'ansmission-capability and the transmission costs fo cryocables and conventional cables that have been found are in close agreement with the corresponding data which are cited in a recently published study of A. D. Little entitled"Underground Power Transmission". Within the accuracy which is nowadays possible in such a calculation it is found that all the five cable concepts can competewith the present cable systems. The following advantages may be important for the justification of the development of cryocables: the width of the <b>cable</b> <b>trench</b> related to the power rating is considerably less compared with conventional cables (see Fig. 8. 1) - by stepswise uprating of the installed cooling-stations the transmission capability can be adapted to the growing demand. - a multiplication of the transmission-capability is possible, if more cooling stations are installed in thecourse of the line. even operating at the maximum continous load, a cryocable can sustain a substantially higher short-time overload compared to a conventional cable because of its high heat capacity. Although we expect no unsurmöuntable obstacles in the development of the cable concept which are considered to be promising, some important problems have to be solved, for example, the design of the electrical insulation, favourable construction of the conductor, shielding and piping for low eddy current losses and so on (see chapter 4. 2. 8). The data worked out in this study show that the cross-sections of cryocables will be large compared to conventional cables...|$|E
40|$|Many onshore windfarms in Scotland {{are being}} built on peatlands. As a consequence, the impacts of {{development}} activities on the peatland and downstream environments are an important emerging issue. For example, a reduction of the quantity of carbon (C) stored in the peatland and increased phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) concentrations in streams may cause changes in the peatland carbon sink strength and aquatic carbon emissions, and exceedance of EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) P threshold values, respectively. To further assess the impacts from peatland-based windfarm development, the following four research questions were posed: 1. Which specific development activities have {{the greatest impact on}} concentrations of C, N and P in streams? How long does it take for C, N and P concentrations to return to baseline conditions? 2. Which specific windfarm development activities caused the greatest aquatic export of carbon and nutrients? 3. What are the controls on concentration and export of aquatic C, N and P in streams draining peatland developments? 4. How effective are site-derived adsorbent materials and an iron ochre at preventing phosphorus from entering upland streams on peatland? Presented in this thesis, are the results from 3 -weekly spatial streamwater sampling of 18 sub-catchments (ranging 0. 03 - 12 km 2) – from October 2011 to March 2013 – which covers the majority of the peatland-based development and one year beyond, of the Whitelee windfarm Phase 2 extension 16 km south of Glasgow, Scotland. Dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC/POC), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total oxidised nitrogen (TON) concentrations were measured and exports were calculated from stream gauging. The spatial catchment controls on stream water chemistry were investigated through a multiple linear regression analysis. Fraction of sub-catchment area that was subject to forest felling was found to be significantly positively correlated with concentrations and exports of DOC, POC, SRP and TON; with TON specifically by felling that had occurred more than one year previously. Density of tracks / cable trenches / turbines, and fraction non-forested area in general exerted a negative control on exports. Evidence of SRP attenuation processes in addition to dilution were found in some streams. While neither river sediment nor track or <b>cable</b> <b>trench</b> gravels were very effective at removing SRP, from the results of batch adsorption experiments, a sample of mineral subsoil was. SRP was attenuated in areas where there was a greater proportion of peaty gleys, in the riparian zone along the main stream, and the outcome of the batch adsorption experiments points to attenuation of SRP onto mineral subsoils, where present. Comparing long-term (seven year) time series of the original Whitelee windfarm directly north of the site, with the extension site (this study) it was possible to estimate the time required for recovery to pre-development concentrations. Mean annual [DOC] increased to 31. 4 mg l- 1 during development of the extension site. While it took five years for the DOC to recover at the original site, in the year following development at the extension site, mean annual [DOC] was still above the baseline. Mean annual [POC] increased to a maximum of 2. 6 mg l- 1 during development of the extension site, and as with the original site it returned to the baseline the year following development. The mean annual [SRP] increased to a maximum of 50. 5 μg l- 1 during development, leading to a reduction in water quality from ‘good’ to ‘moderate’ based on comparison with Environmental Quality Standards (EQS). It took four years for the SRP to recover at the original site, and mean annual [SRP] was still above baseline at the extension site in the year following development. The streamwater C, N and P has not been measured as close to, and for such a range of, windfarm development activities. This research has demonstrated links between windfarm development, forest felling in particular, and increased concentrations and exports of DOC, POC, SRP and TON in streams. While the increases were localised within the site itself, investigation of attenuation processes point to peaty gley soils along the main stream, and tracks, cable trenches and turbines – and their associated settling lagoons and silt fences – as potentially mitigating the increased dissolved carbon and nutrients. Outcomes of this research are suggested improvements to the guidance for developing peatlands, especially with regards to monitoring streamwater carbon for a sufficient period post-development, and for the removal of brash on peat soils. Further research could investigate the use of adsorption materials to mitigate phosphorus mobilisation from brash sources to streams, over a time scale of at least two years at the field scale. Laboratory-based environmental fate studies of the increased streamwater carbon could investigate the rates of CO 2 efflux with time and with varying concentrations of nutrients, which would help to improve the Scottish Government's carbon calculator estimates of carbon loss from peatland-based windfarm development...|$|E

Galleries were dug to be opened after the attack for communication or <b>cable</b> <b>trenches,</b> the work being done by the 172nd, 176th, 182nd and 185th Tunnelling companies (Lieutenant-Colonel G. C. Williams, Controller of Mines First Army).|$|R
50|$|Onshore {{construction}} work began in June 2015 with {{construction of a}} new electricity substation adjacent to the existing National Grid Bolney 400/132kV substation near Twineham. The first wind turbine was lifted into place in March 2017, with work to backfill the <b>cable</b> duct <b>trenches</b> off Lancing beach initially due to be completed in Spring 2017. The installation of a 2,000 tonne offshore substation was completed in April of 2017: however, backfilling has been delayed due to a digger being lost off Lancing beach, with salvage attempts ongoing as of late May 2017. Construction of the wind farm is expected to be completed in 2018 at a cost of £1.3 billion.|$|R

50|$|Great Lakes Dredge and Dock conducts {{most of its}} {{operations}} within the United States and 25% of {{its operations}} abroad, particularly in the Middle East. GLD&D dredging operations consist of deepening and maintaining waterways, shipping channels, and ports; creating and maintaining (re-nourishing) beaches; excavating new harbors; reclaiming land in the water or improving low-lying land areas; restoring aquatic and wetland habitats and excavating pipeline, <b>cable</b> and tunnel <b>trenches.</b>|$|R
40|$|Trench digging {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} types of {{construction}} work documented in history. Prior to World War II, trenches were dug by hand. As workers dug trenches deeper, the sides of the trench had to be shored, or supported, to keep the walls of the trench from collapsing. Following the war, innovations were made in <b>cable</b> backhoes, and <b>trench</b> digging disappeared as an established profession. By the 1950 's, hydraulically-actuate...|$|R
