5|$|Fungal {{pneumonia}} is uncommon, but occurs {{more commonly}} in individuals with weakened immune systems due to AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs, or other medical problems. It {{is most often}} caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, blastomyces, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jiroveci (pneumocystis pneumonia), and Coccidioides immitis. Histoplasmosis is most common in the Mississippi River basin, and <b>coccidioidomycosis</b> is most common in the Southwestern United States. The number of cases has been increasing in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population.|$|E
5|$|Lung cancer often {{appears as}} a solitary {{pulmonary}} nodule on a chest radiograph. However, the differential diagnosis is wide. Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including metastatic cancer, hamartomas, and infectious granulomas such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis and <b>coccidioidomycosis.</b> Lung cancer can also be an incidental finding, as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan done for an unrelated reason. The definitive diagnosis of lung cancer is based on histological examination of the suspicious tissue {{in the context of}} the clinical and radiological features.|$|E
5|$|Some fungi {{can cause}} serious {{diseases}} in humans, several {{of which may}} be fatal if untreated. These include aspergillosis, candidiasis, <b>coccidioidomycosis,</b> cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, mycetomas, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Furthermore, persons with immuno-deficiencies are particularly susceptible to disease by genera such as Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptoccocus, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis. Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin, the so-called dermatophytic and keratinophilic fungi, and cause local infections such as ringworm and athlete's foot. Fungal spores are also a cause of allergies, and fungi from different taxonomic groups can evoke allergic reactions.|$|E
25|$|During {{the next}} several decades {{it became clear that}} the {{etiological}} agent of the disease that was at first called Coccidioides infection and later <b>coccidioidomycosis</b> was a fungal pathogen, and <b>coccidioidomycosis</b> was also distinguished from Histoplasmosis and Blastomycosis. Further, C. immitis was identified as the culprit of respiratory disorders previously called San Joaquin Valley fever, desert fever, and Valley fever, and a serum precipitin test was developed by Charles E. Smith that was able to detect an acute form of the infection. In retrospect, Smith played a major role in both medical research and raising awareness about <b>coccidioidomycosis,</b> especially when he became dean of the School of Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley in 1951.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Coccidioides posadasii was {{identified}} as genetically distinct from C. immitis despite their morphologic similarities and can also cause <b>coccidioidomycosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The winds carry Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii spores into nonendemic areas, a {{pathogenic}} fungus {{that causes}} <b>Coccidioidomycosis</b> ("Valley Fever"). Symptomatic infection (40 percent of cases) usually presents as an influenza-like illness with fever, cough, headaches, rash, and myalgia (muscle pain). Serious complications include severe pneumonia, lung nodules, and disseminated disease, where the fungus spreads throughout the body. The disseminated form of <b>Coccidioidomycosis</b> can devastate the body, causing skin ulcers, abscesses, bone lesions, severe joint pain, heart inflammation, urinary tract problems, meningitis, and often death.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coccidioidomycosis</b> is {{endemic to}} the western {{hemisphere}} between 40°N and 40°S. The ecological niches are characterized by hot summers and mild winters with an annual rainfall of 10–50cm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coccidioidomycosis</b> is {{a common}} cause of community-acquired {{pneumonia}} in the endemic areas of the United States. Infections usually occur due to inhalation of the arthroconidial spores after soil disruption. The disease is not contagious. In some cases the infection may recur or become chronic.|$|E
25|$|California state prisons, {{beginning}} in 1919, {{have been particularly}} affected by <b>coccidioidomycosis.</b> In 2005 and 2006, the Pleasant Valley State Prison near Coalinga and Avenal State Prison near Avenal {{on the western side}} of the San Joaquin Valley had the highest incidence in 2005, of at least 3,000 per 100,000. The receiver appointed in Plata v. Schwarzenegger issued an order in May 2013 requiring relocation of vulnerable populations in those prisons.|$|E
25|$|Serious {{complications}} {{may occur}} {{in patients who}} have weakened immune systems, including severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and bronchopleural fistulas requiring resection, lung nodules, and possible disseminated form, where the infection spreads throughout the body. The disseminated form of <b>coccidioidomycosis</b> can devastate the body, causing skin ulcers, abscesses, bone lesions, swollen joints with severe pain, heart inflammation, urinary tract problems, and inflammation of the brain's lining, {{which can lead to}} death.|$|E
25|$|Significant disease {{develops}} in fewer than 5% of those infected and typically occurs {{in those with}} a weakened immune system. Mild asymptomatic cases often do not require any treatment, and the symptoms will go away within a few months. Those with severe symptoms may benefit from anti-fungal therapy, which usually requires 3–6 months of treatment. There {{is a lack of}} prospective studies that examine optimal anti-fungal therapy for <b>coccidioidomycosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In dogs, {{the most}} common symptom of <b>coccidioidomycosis</b> is a chronic cough, which can be dry or moist. Other {{symptoms}} include fever (in approximately 50% of cases), weight loss, anorexia, lethargy, and depression. The disease can disseminate throughout the dog's body, most commonly causing osteomyelitis (infection of the bone marrow), which leads to lameness. Dissemination can cause other symptoms, depending on which organs are infected. If the fungus infects the heart or pericardium, it can cause heart failure and death.|$|E
25|$|An unusual {{effect of}} the Northridge {{earthquake}} was an outbreak of <b>coccidioidomycosis</b> (Valley fever) in Ventura County. This respiratory disease is caused by inhaling airborne spores of fungus. The 203 cases reported, of which three resulted in fatalities, constituted roughly 10 times the normal rate in the initial eight weeks. This was the first report of such an outbreak following an earthquake, and {{it is believed that}} the spores were carried in large clouds of dust created by seismically triggered landslides. Most of the cases occurred immediately downwind of the landslides.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, C. Immitis is {{endemic to}} {{southern}} and central California {{with the highest}} presence in the San Joaquin Valley. C. posadassi is most prevalent in Arizona, although {{it can be found}} in a wider region spanning from Utah, New Mexico, Texas, and Nevada. An estimated 150,000 infections occur annually, with 25,000 new infections occurring every year. The incidence of <b>coccidioidomycosis</b> in the United States in 2011 (42.6 per 100,000) was almost ten times higher than the incidence reported in 1998 (5.3 per 100,000). In area where it is most prevalent, the infection rate is 2-4%.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{shortage}} of healthcare workers, limited access to equipment, and tension between white administrators and Japanese American staff, these hospitals provided much needed medical care in camp. The extreme climates of the remote incarceration sites were hard on infants and elderly inmates. The frequent dust storms of the high desert locations led to increased cases of asthma and <b>coccidioidomycosis,</b> while the swampy, mosquito-infested Arkansas camps exposed residents to malaria, {{all of which were}} treated in camp. Almost 6,000 live deliveries were performed in these hospitals, and all mothers received pre- and postnatal care. The WRA recorded 1,862 deaths across the ten camps, with cancer, heart disease, tuberculosis, and vascular disease accounting for the majority.|$|E
25|$|Raising both {{surveillance}} {{and awareness of}} the disease while medical researchers are developing a human vaccine can positively contribute towards prevention efforts. Research demonstrates that patients from endemic areas who {{are aware of the}} disease are most likely to request diagnostic testing for <b>coccidioidomycosis.</b> Presently, Meridian Bioscience manufactures the so-called EIA test to diagnose the Valley fever, which however is known for producing a fair quantity of false positives. Currently, recommended prevention measures can include type-of-exposure-based respirator protection for persons engaged in agriculture, construction and others working outdoors in endemic areas. Dust control measures such as planting grass and wetting the soil, and also limiting exposure to dust storms are advisable for residential areas in endemic regions.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998-2011, {{there were}} 111,117 cases of <b>coccidioidomycosis</b> in the U.S. that were logged into the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).

2500|$|Coccidioides immitis {{resides in}} the soil here as {{in much of the}} southwestern United States and so <b>coccidioidomycosis</b> is endemic. Valley Fever is a common term for this fungal {{infection}} caused by C. immitis through the inhalation of airborne dust or dirt.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1986, Marvin {{was hospitalized}} {{for more than}} two weeks because of a {{condition}} related to <b>coccidioidomycosis.</b> He went into respiratory distress and was administered steroids to help his breathing.

2500|$|The {{first case}} {{of what was}} later named <b>coccidioidomycosis</b> was {{described}} in 1892 in Buenos Aires by Alejandro Posadas, a medical intern at the Hospital de Clínicas [...] "José de San Martín". Posadas established an infectious character of the disease after being able to transfer it in laboratory conditions to lab animals. In the U.S., E. Rixford, a physician from a San Francisco hospital, and T. C. Gilchrist, a pathologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School, became early pioneers of clinical studies of the infection. They decided that the causative organism was a Coccidia-type protozoan and named it Coccidioides immitis (resembling Coccidia, not mild).|$|E
2500|$|On the whole, oral {{fluconazole}} and intravenous amphotericin B {{are used}} in progressive or disseminated disease, or in immunocompromised individuals. Amphotericin B {{used to be the}} only available treatment, although now there are alternatives, including itraconazole or ketoconazole may be used for milder disease. Fluconazole is the preferred medication for coccidioidal meningitis, due to its penetration into CSF. Intrathecal or intraventricular amphotericin B therapy is used if infection persists after fluconazole treatment. Itraconazole is used for cases that involve treatment of infected person's bones and joints. The antifungal medications posaconazole and voriconazole have also been used to treat <b>coccidioidomycosis.</b> [...] Because the symptoms of valley fever are similar to the common flu and other respiratory diseases, it is important for public health professionals {{to be aware of the}} rise of valley fever and the specifics of diagnosis. [...] Greyhound dogs often get valley fever as well, and their treatment regimen involves 6–12 months of Ketoconazole, to be taken with food.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} populations {{that have a}} higher risk for {{contracting}} <b>coccidioidomycosis</b> and developing the advanced disseminated version of the disease. Populations with exposure to the airborne arthroconidia working in agriculture and construction have a higher risk. Outbreaks have also been linked to earthquakes, windstorms and military training exercises where the ground is disturbed. Historically an infection {{is more likely to}} occur in males than females, although this could be attributed to occupation rather than gender specific. [...] Women who are pregnant and immediately postpartum are at a high risk of infection and dissemination. There is also an association between stage of pregnancy and severity of the disease, with third trimester women being more likely to develop dissemination. Presumably this is related to highly elevated hormonal levels, which stimulate growth and maturation of spherules and subsequent release of endospores. Certain ethnic populations are more susceptible to disseminated coccioidomycosis. The risk of dissemination is 175 times greater in Filipinos and 10 times greater in African Americans than non-Hispanic whites. Individuals with a weakened immune system are also more susceptible to the disease. In particular, individuals with HIV and diseases that impair T-cell function. Individuals with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes are also at a higher risk. Age also affects the severity of the disease, with more than one third of deaths being in the 65-84 age group.|$|E
