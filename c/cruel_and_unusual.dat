5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was proposed}} and adopted {{on the grounds}} it was more humane than the methods of execution {{in place at the}} time, such as the electric chair and gas chamber. Opponents of lethal injection reject this argument, noting multiple cases where executions have been either painful, prolonged, or both. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, lethal injections have the highest rate of botched executions of any method used in the US, with 7.12% of executions using this method between 1982 and 2010 considered to have not gone according to plan. A study published in The Lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness. However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled 7–2 in 2008 (Baze v. Rees) and 5–4 in 2015 (Glossip v. Gross) that lethal injection does not constitute <b>cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>unusual</b> punishment.|$|E

In a confidential report issued in July 2004 and leaked to The New York Times in November 2004, Red Cross inspectors accused the U.S. military of using [...] "humiliating acts, solitary confinement, temperature extremes, {{and use of}} forced positions" [...] against prisoners. The inspectors concluded that [...] "the construction of such a system, whose stated purpose is the production of intelligence, cannot be considered other than an intentional system of <b>cruel,</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>and</b> degrading treatment and a form of torture." [...] The United States government reportedly rejected the Red Cross findings at the time.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after {{adopting}} {{the declaration of}} independence, the delegates began {{to work on a}} new Constitution.

The declaration of rights also outlawed unreasonable search and seizure, debtors' prison, <b>and</b> <b>cruel</b> or <b>unusual</b> punishments. [...] It omitted the Third Amendment to the United States Constitution and instead explicitly authorized the government to quarter troops in private homes and impress property as needed for the war effort.|$|R

5000|$|The memo {{discusses}} the Convention Against Torture (which the memo calls the [...] "Torture Convention") and {{concludes that the}} convention makes a distinction between torture and [...] "cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment", and that therefore torture is [...] "only the most extreme acts", which the memo concludes, together with the ratifying reservations of the United States, confirms the interpretation of torture found in part one. It concludes that torture does not include [...] "other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" [...] because such language is found in a different article than the definition of torture, and because {{it appears that the}} convention does not intend to criminalize such action, but instead discourage it. The memo examines the ratification history, and cites U.S. case law stating that the executive branch's interpretation of the treaty [...] "is to be accorded the greatest weight in ascertaining a treaty's intent and meaning". It finds in the congressional record that the Reagan administration understood torture to be [...] "at the extreme end of <b>cruel,</b> inhuman <b>and</b> degrading treatment or punishment", and that such treatment or punishment, which is not torture, to be [...] "the <b>cruel,</b> <b>unusual,</b> <b>and</b> inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States".|$|R

25|$|This {{case was}} argued on October 13, 2004. The appeal {{challenged}} {{the constitutionality of}} capital punishment for persons who were juveniles when their crimes were committed, citing the Eighth Amendment protection against <b>cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>unusual</b> punishment.|$|E
25|$|The Court was {{determined}} to simultaneously save capital punishment in the United States and impose some reasoned basis for carrying it out. That reasoning flows from the Eighth Amendment's <b>cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>unusual</b> punishment clause. Although capital punishment, per se, was not found by the Court to be <b>cruel</b> <b>and</b> <b>unusual,</b> it must still be carried out {{in a manner consistent}} with the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society. In the Court's view, the country's history with capital punishment suggests that those evolving standards of decency could not tolerate a return to the mandatory death penalty for murder that had prevailed in medieval England.|$|E
