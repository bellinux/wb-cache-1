5|$|Chépart {{himself was}} taken captive by the Natchez, {{who were at}} first unsure {{what to do with}} him, but finally decided that he should be killed by a stinkard—a member of the lowest caste in the tribe's hierarchy. The Natchez kept two Frenchmen alive, a carter named Mayeux who was made to <b>carry</b> <b>all</b> the goods of the French to the Great Village, and a tailor named Le Beau who was {{employed}} by the Natchez to refit the colonists' clothing to new owners. They set fire to the fort, the store, and all the homesteads, burning them to the ground. Just as Governor Bienville had done with the executed Indians in 1717 and 1723, the Natchez beheaded the dead Frenchmen and brought the severed heads for the Great Sun to view.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, {{when the}} U.S. Highway system was first announced, {{there was a}} gap in US-50 between Ely and Thistle. At the time the states of Utah and Nevada were feuding about which of the old auto trails would be paved and used for the new U.S. Highway System. Nevada favored the Lincoln Highway, which the modern US-50 closely follows in that state. Utah refused to {{consider}} the Lincoln Highway west of Salt Lake City. Officials perceived that route would <b>carry</b> <b>all</b> California bound traffic directly to Nevada while passing through very few communities in Utah. Utah instead favored the Victory Highway (modern Interstate 80 west of Salt Lake) and the Arrowhead Trail (modern Interstate 15). By favoring these routes Utah could force travelers destined for southern California to use a different route than those destined for northern California, with both of these traversing through more cities in Utah than the Lincoln Highway. The Arrowhead trail was especially beneficial to Utah as it passed through many communities in the state, but only Las Vegas in Nevada.|$|E

5|$|In some cases, {{travelling}} through unmapped areas, {{men took}} {{up to six}} weeks just to reach their destinations. They often had to <b>carry</b> <b>all</b> their supplies, arms and their radio, often {{with the help of}} Papuan carriers. Teams of two or three spotters typically maintained the stations, each led by an acting non-commissioned-officer (NCO), working in isolation from friendly forces in remote locations for extended periods of time. The teams survived on limited rations, usually supplemented by native food sources. Once their initial supplies were expended they usually had to fend for themselves, although stations were also sometimes re-supplied by airdrop or by sea, but usually only {{in the event of a}} failure of mission essential equipment, or when petrol for the radios ran low. Spotting stations were usually only lightly armed, being usually equipped with just one Owen Gun with 600 rounds for the NCO in charge, and a rifle with only 50 rounds for each other man.|$|E
5|$|When the {{division}} arrived in France, it {{came under the}} command of the First Allied Airborne Army, which controlled all Allied airborne formations. The division, along with two others, was selected to participate in Operation Varsity, the airborne operation to support the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group crossing the River Rhine, but was removed from the operation due to there being insufficient transport aircraft to <b>carry</b> <b>all</b> three divisions into combat. Several other operations were planned for {{the division}} after the end of Operation Varsity, but these operations were cancelled when their objectives were captured by the rapid advance of Allied ground forces and they became superfluous. After the end of the conflict in Europe, the 13th Airborne was shipped to the United States to stage there before it was to participate in the planned invasion of Japan, but the conflict in the Far East ended before it was required and it remained in the United States. The 13th Airborne Division was finally inactivated on 26 February 1946 and its combat personnel were transferred to the command of the 82nd Airborne Division.|$|E

25|$|During World War I the Grand Duke of Finland (aka Tsar Nicholas II of Russia) {{ordered all}} German-owned {{possessions}} within Finland to be confiscated. Therefore, between 18 August 1914 and 15 June 1918 the Turku tramway was under {{control of the}} Turku and Pori County under the name Turun Sähkölaitos. The war resulted in unprecedented growth in passenger numbers, {{to the extent that}} there was not enough capacity to <b>carry</b> <b>all</b> potential passengers. Following {{the end of the war}} and the subsequent Finnish independence, control of the tramway was returned to Electricitätswerk Åbo AG. However, already on 15 April 1919 the City of Turku purchased the highly profitable tram operations for itself.|$|E
25|$|A fuse {{consists}} of a metal strip or wire fuse element, of small cross-section compared to the circuit conductors, mounted between a pair of electrical terminals, and (usually) enclosed by a non-combustible housing. The fuse is arranged in series to <b>carry</b> <b>all</b> the current passing through the protected circuit. The resistance of the element generates heat due to the current flow. The size and construction of the element is (empirically) determined so that the heat produced for a normal current does not cause the element to attain a high temperature. If too high a current flows, the element rises to a higher temperature and either directly melts, or else melts a soldered joint within the fuse, opening the circuit.|$|E

25|$|Scuba gas {{planning}} is {{the aspect of}} dive planning which deals with the calculation or estimation of the amounts and mixtures of gases {{to be used for}} a planned dive profile, and can be critical to the safety of the dive. The scuba diver by definition is independent of surface supply and, in general, must <b>carry</b> <b>all</b> gas needed for the dive, though in limited circumstances depots of drop cylinders may be placed along the route of the dive for use on the return. This requires the route to be marked and the divers to return along the marked route, and is particularly suited to penetration dives, such as wreck and cave dives.|$|E
25|$|Management of {{breathing}} gas {{is a critical}} skill for scuba diving, as the scuba diver must, by definition, <b>carry</b> <b>all</b> the required breathing gas for a dive, and running out unexpectedly is at best alarming, and at worst can have fatal consequences. For the basic case of no-decompression open-water diving, where a free ascent is acceptable in an emergency, this may {{be as simple as}} ensuring that sufficient air remains in the cylinder to allow a safe ascent at any time, usually allowing for a contingency reserve, and for the possibility of an assisted ascent, where the diver supplies breathing gas to a buddy. Gas management becomes more complex when solo diving, decompression diving, penetration diving, or diving with more than one gas mixture.|$|E

25|$|There {{were not}} enough ships to <b>carry</b> <b>all</b> of the Noldor across the sea, so Fëanor and his sons led the first group. Upon {{arriving}} at Losgar, {{in the land of}} Lammoth, in the far west of Beleriand, where Morgoth and Ungoliant had passed not long before, they decided to burn the ships and leave the followers of Fingolfin behind. However, Fëanor's son Amrod died at Losgar, having been accidentally burnt with the Telerin ships. The remaining Noldor saw the flames, and perceived that if they were to go to Middle-earth, they {{had no choice but to}} cross the Helcaraxë. Unwilling to return to Valinor, they did that under the leadership of Fingolfin, and suffered great losses along the way, which greatly added to the animosity they had for Fëanor and his sons.|$|E
25|$|On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company {{signed a}} multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films. Later that year, on December 4, Netflix and Disney {{announced}} an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, which were available on Netflix beginning in 2016. However, classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas were instantly available {{upon completion of}} the deal. Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013. The agreement with Disney is scheduled to end in 2019, as the company is preparing to launch a new streaming service that will <b>carry</b> <b>all</b> Walt Disney Pictures, Lucasfilm, and Marvel Studios releases.

25|$|In 1940, the Brooklyn & Richmond Ferry Company {{asked the}} city to stop its {{municipal}} operation to 39th Street so the 69th Street ferry could <b>carry</b> <b>all</b> Staten Island-to-Brooklyn traffic, thus enabling them to lower rates. The 39th Street ferry was suspended in June 1946 after a fire destroyed the Whitehall ferry slips at St. George, which forced the Whitehall ferries {{to stop at the}} slips formerly used by the 39th Street ferry. The suspension of ferry service was supposed to be temporary, but even after a year had elapsed, merchants at Brooklyn's Bush Terminal near 39th Street were petitioning {{the city to}} resume service. However, this service was apparently never restored. Around this time, ferry services in the area were being discontinued and replaced by bridges and tunnels, leading to the eventual demise of the 69th Street ferry. The exception was the ferry directly from Manhattan to Staten Island, which was not expected to see a significant decrease in ridership because it provided the only direct link between the two boroughs.|$|E
