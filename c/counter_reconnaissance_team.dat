50|$|Intended for the Radio <b>Reconnaissance</b> <b>Teams</b> {{attached}} to Marine Expeditionary Units, the radio reconnaissance equipment program (RREP) SIGINT suite (SS)-1 is a semiautomated, integrated, open architecture radio intercept and DF system {{composed of a}} ruggedized computer and six functional modules that plug together. RREP SS-1 modules may operate independently or semi-independently. SS-1 enables the radio <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>teams</b> (RRTs) to target the majority of low-level, single-channel, unencrypted tactical signals of interest used by military, police, insurgents, and other potential hostile forces throughout the world.|$|R

A 32 Battalion company were flown in by helicopter to establish a HAA (helicopter administrative area) position for future helicopter missions and this was established by the evening. Also, that evening a special forces <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>team</b> were parachuted into the Chitequeta area to establish a landing zone for the paratroopers and to finalize the whereabouts of the PLAN bases in that area which had been formally established by intelligence. By the 2 November, 61 Mechanized had reached the HAA and refueled while later during the day the SAAF begun to fly the transport and assault helicopters into the HAA. 32 Battalion <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>team</b> were leap-frogged to Ionde to check for enemy positions and that would become the position for the SADF tactical headquarters the following day.|$|R

Exercises and operations have thus far shown that the concept is viable, but Seabee Engineer <b>Reconnaissance</b> <b>Teams</b> have encountered problems with data gathering and reporting, and transmission of data and images. Concurrently, the Department of Defense is pursuing a transformation toward network- centric warfare. Network Centric Warfare represents a powerful set of warfighting concepts and associated military capabilities that allow warfighters {{to take full advantage of}} all available information in order to bring all available assets to bear in a rapid and flexible manner. This research explores the state of the practice of military engineer reconnaissance as described by established Army doctrine and as enacted by Navy Seabee Engineer <b>Reconnaissance</b> <b>Teams.</b> Commercial information technology applications are reviewed in the areas of geographic information systems, collaborative design, and wireless communications. Solutions are proposed for their potential to enable network centric engineer reconnaissance operations.
