5|$|When the {{requirement}} for the Apache had been formalised in the early 1990s, military doctrine assumed that a large conventional armoured assault from the Eastern Bloc was Britain's main threat. Following the collapse and break-up of the Soviet Union, the concepts of flexibility and rapid response took precedence. The UK's Strategic Defence Review called for Apaches to undertake amphibious attack missions, operating from the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, the Invincible class aircraft <b>carriers</b> <b>and</b> their successors, the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft <b>carriers,</b> <b>and</b> possibly the amphibious assault vessels HMS Bulwark and Albion. Each squadron equipped with the Apache should have eight operational aircraft.|$|E
5|$|A second British raid, {{which had}} been {{scheduled}} to take off from 08:00 on 17 July, was cancelled two minutes before the aircraft were to begin launching when fog began to build up near the <b>carriers,</b> <b>and</b> the British fleet turned south to return to Scapa Flow.

5|$|Advances {{were made}} in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with {{aircraft}} <b>carriers</b> <b>and</b> submarines. Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success {{at the start of}} the war, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship.|$|E
5|$|Begun in 1939, {{plans were}} far enough along that tests were {{conducted}} with the main armament and against the underwater protection. Even though the ships were approved for construction under a 1942 fleet replenishment program, the prioritizing of aircraft <b>carriers</b> <b>and</b> smaller ships due to the war, followed by Japan's defeat, killed any chance of the B-65's construction.|$|E

5|$|A mockup of the cockpit, center {{fuselage}} and wing {{center section}} was built and was inspected by the BuAer {{in the fall}} 1944. However, the contract for the prototype XTSF-1s was terminated in January 1945. This was due {{to a variety of}} factors, including the Navy's belief that the Grumman engineers and factory were already at capacity producing the F6F Hellcat, the F7F, and the F8F Bearcat, that the XTSF-1 would be too large for practical operations from escort <b>carriers,</b> <b>and</b> because it was believed the Grumman G-70, to be built as the XTB3F, was a better prospect. In addition, the F7F was proving difficult to certify for operations from aircraft carriers, further prejudicing the Navy against the design.|$|E
5|$|After Midway and the {{exhausting}} attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign, Japan's capacity to replace its losses in materiel (particularly aircraft <b>carriers)</b> <b>and</b> men (especially well-trained pilots and maintenance crewmen) rapidly became insufficient {{to cope with}} mounting casualties, while the United States' massive industrial and training capabilities made losses far easier to replace. The Battle of Midway, along with the Guadalcanal Campaign, is widely considered {{a turning point in}} the Pacific War.|$|E

5|$|At 08:50, {{the lead}} U.S. attack {{formation}} from Hornet spotted four ships from Abe's Vanguard force. Pressing on, the U.S. aircraft sighted the Japanese <b>carriers</b> <b>and</b> prepared to attack. Three Zeros from Zuihō attacked the formation's Wildcats, drawing {{them away from}} the bombers they were assigned to protect. Thus, the dive bombers in the first group initiated their attacks without fighter escort. Twenty Zeros from the Japanese carrier CAP attacked the SBD formation and shot down four of them. The remaining 11 SBDs commenced their attack dives on Shōkaku at 09:27, hitting her with three to six bombs, wrecking her flight deck and causing serious damage to the interior of the ship. The final SBD of the 11 lost track of Shōkaku and instead dropped its bomb near the Japanese destroyer , causing minor damage. The six TBFs in the first strike force, having become separated from their strike group, did not find the Japanese <b>carriers</b> <b>and</b> eventually turned back towards Hornet. On the way back, they attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser , missing with all their torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{played a}} minor {{role in the}} Japan {{campaign}} in {{the last months of}} the war and was preparing to participate in the invasion of Japan at the time the war ended. Several Australian warships operated with the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) during the Battle of Okinawa and Australian destroyers later escorted British aircraft <b>carriers</b> <b>and</b> battleships during attacks on targets in the Japanese home islands. Despite its distance from Japan, Australia was the BPF's main base and a large number of facilities were built to support the fleet.|$|E

5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, twice as much time to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car <b>carriers,</b> <b>and</b> 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E
5|$|During July 1945 the U.S Third Fleet, {{which was}} led by Admiral William Halsey, {{conducted}} a series of air raids and naval bombardments against targets in Japan. These attacks were made by the Third Fleet's striking force, Task Force38 (TF38), which was commanded by Vice Admiral John S. McCain and included nine fleet carriers, six light <b>carriers</b> <b>and</b> their escorts. Almost one thousand aircraft were embarked on board these carriers. On 10July TF38's aircraft struck airfields around Tokyo and claimed to have destroyed 340 Japanese aircraft on the ground and two in the air. No Japanese aircraft responded to this attack as they were being held in reserve to mount large-scale suicide attacks on the Allied fleet during the expected invasion of the country later in 1945. Following this raid, the Third Fleet conducted raids on Hokkaido and northern Honshu on 14 and 15July which sank large numbers of ships and destroyed 25 aircraft on the ground. The American warships then sailed south and on 16July were joined by the British Pacific Fleet's (BPF's) main striking force, which was designated Task Force37 (TF37), and comprised three aircraft <b>carriers</b> <b>and</b> their escorts.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support {{the lens of the}} eye, and their destruction can cause the lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, <b>carriers,</b> <b>and</b> affecteds.|$|E
