40|$|Supporting ranking queries in {{database}} {{systems has}} been a popular research topic recently. However, {{there is a lack}} of study on supporting ranking queries in data warehouses where ranking is on multidimensional aggregates instead of on measures of base facts. To address this problem, we propose a query execution model to answer different types of ranking aggregate queries based on a unified, partial cube structure, ARCube. The query execution model follows a candidate generation and verification framework, where the most promising <b>candidate</b> <b>cells</b> are generated using a set of high-level guiding cells. We also identify a bounding principle for effective pruning: once a guiding cell is pruned, all of its children <b>candidate</b> <b>cells</b> can be pruned. We further address the problem of efficient online candidate aggregation and verification by developing a chunk-based execution model to verify a bulk of candidates within a bounded memory buffer.

40|$|Abstract Background Genome-scale {{studies of}} {{psoriasis}} {{have been used}} to identify genes of potential relevance to disease mechanisms. For many identified genes, however, the cell type mediating disease activity is uncertain, which has limited our ability to design gene functional studies based on genomic findings. Methods We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with altered expression in psoriasis lesions (n[*]=[*] 216 patients), as well as candidate genes near susceptibility loci from psoriasis GWAS studies. These gene sets were characterized based upon their expression across 10 cell types present in psoriasis lesions. Susceptibility-associated variation at intergenic (non-coding) loci was evaluated to identify sites of allele-specific transcription factor binding. Results Half of DEGs showed highest expression in skin cells, although the dominant cell type differed between psoriasis-increased DEGs (keratinocytes, 35 %) and psoriasis-decreased DEGs (fibroblasts, 33 %). In contrast, psoriasis GWAS candidates tended to have highest expression in immune cells (71 %), with a significant fraction showing maximal expression in neutrophils (24 %, P[*]<[*] 0. 001). By identifying <b>candidate</b> <b>cell</b> types for genes near susceptibility loci, we could identify and prioritize SNPs at which susceptibility variants are predicted to influence transcription factor binding. This led to the identification of potentially causal (non-coding) SNPs for which susceptibility variants influence binding of AP- 1, NF-κB, IRF 1, STAT 3 and STAT 4. Conclusions These findings underscore the role of innate immunity in psoriasis and highlight neutrophils as a cell type linked with pathogenetic mechanisms. Assignment of <b>candidate</b> <b>cell</b> types to genes emerging from GWAS studies provides a first step towards functional analysis, and we have proposed an approach for generating hypotheses to explain GWAS hits at intergenic loci...|$|R

Mobile stations near the cell boundary can {{have opportunities to}} encounter a link that can provide better condition than the link in service {{due to the nature}} of fading effect. Conventional FCS schemes can track the variation of channel fading, exploiting a site selection diversity gain. However, mobile stations near the cell boundary may suffer from other cell interference (OCI) which is highly time-varying and unpredictable. To mitigate the OCI effect, we propose a new FCS scheme that exploits cell selection diversity while preventing adjacent cells from using the same sub-channels. We also consider the selection of <b>candidate</b> <b>cells.</b> The performance of the proposed FSC scheme is analyzed in terms of the capacity using an upper bound.
