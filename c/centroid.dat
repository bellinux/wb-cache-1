5|$|Kepler-14 is {{a binary}} star system, {{which means that}} it is {{actually}} composed of two gravitationally bound stars that orbit a common point in space. The system is composed of a primary star, Kepler-14A, and a dimmer companion star, Kepler-14B. When the stars were observed, while searching for the planet Kepler-14b, the angular separation of the binary system made it extremely difficult to note the dimmer companion star. The stars have such a wide orbit that it takes approximately 2800 years for each star to complete a revolution around the <b>centroid.</b> The two stars are located approximately 980 parsecs (3,196 light years) from Earth.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Escape from Butcher Bay, Starbreeze again {{encountered}} financial difficulties after having not received a significant royalty payment from Vivendi. It sold part of its motion capture and animation department to a British company, <b>Centroid.</b> However, the game helped set Starbreeze's reputation as a studio capable of making good licensed titles. With the help of Union Entertainment, an intermediary company, Starbreeze {{signed an agreement with}} Majesco Entertainment for a new title set within The Darkness universe owned by Top Cow Comics on July 16, 2004. Midway through the game's development, Majesco underwent restructuring because of financial difficulties, shifted its focus, and dropped the game. 2K Games stepped up and acquired the publishing rights. 2K extended the game's development cycle, and asked Starbreeze to develop a multiplayer mode for the game. The Darkness was released in 2007. It fared worse than the team expected critically, but its commercial performance was satisfactory, selling more than 1 million copies worldwide.|$|E
25|$|A {{median of}} a {{triangle}} is {{a straight line}} through a vertex and {{the midpoint of the}} opposite side, and divides the triangle into two equal areas. The three medians intersect in a single point, the triangle's <b>centroid</b> or geometric barycenter, usually denoted by G. The <b>centroid</b> of a rigid triangular object (cut out of a thin sheet of uniform density) is also its center of mass: the object can be balanced on its <b>centroid</b> in a uniform gravitational field.

This is easy to realize with good robustness; however, locating accuracy varies with weight. There is no conclusion as to the relationship between weight and <b>centroiding</b> accuracy. To find this relationship and thus acquire the highest achievable accuracy of <b>centroiding,</b> one must first derive the general model of <b>centroiding</b> as follows. (1) Set weighting as a function that includes the grayscale intensity of each pixel and two undetermined parameters α and β. The centers were calculated from the new weights. (2) Design an accuracy evaluation method for <b>centroiding</b> based on a virtual straight-line target to obtain the accuracy of <b>centroiding</b> with various parameters. With these parameter values and accuracy records, the accuracy-parameter curve can be fitted. In the end, simulations and experiments are conducted to prove the accuracy improvement of this variable-weighted grayscale <b>centroiding</b> compared with traditional <b>centroiding.</b> The experimental result shows that the parameter α contributes significantly to accuracy improvement. When α = 1. 5, locating accuracy is 1 / 170 pixels.

We show that ordinary velocity <b>centroids</b> (normalized and unnormalized) trace the velocity statistics in subsonic and mildly supersonic turbulence (e. g. Mach numbers � 2. 5). At the same time, for highly supersonic turbulence, the statistics of ordinary <b>centroids</b> are strongly affected by density fluctuations, and thus fail to trace the statistics of velocity. We have confirmed for a Mach number ∼ 7 that “modified” velocity <b>centroids</b> (introduced in our earlier work) were able to trace the velocity statistics.

In addition the four medians are divided in a 3:1 ratio by the <b>centroid</b> (see Commandino's theorem).

Text mining is a semi-automated process of extracting knowledge from voluminous unstructured data. A widely studied data mining problem in the text domain is clustering.
