A user may also click on the pie chart segment representing a particular directory, and repeat the analysis for that directory, right click that segment to open a file manager or terminal emulator in that location, or <b>copy</b> <b>to</b> <b>clipboard</b> or delete the directory, and they may right click the segment representing a file to open it, copy it to the clipboard, or delete it.|$|E

40|$|Beta Release This {{release is}} a beta, meaning it is {{intended}} as a relatively stable test release prior to the final 4. 0 production release. There are many improvements over the last production release (3. 1. 2) as detailed in the previous alpha release notes. The main improvement is the restructuring of the models interface meaning that user supplied models are written {{in the same way}} as core models and can be added without rebuilding SasView. User models can also take advantage of polydispersity and GPU acceleration {{in the same way as}} core models. Bug Reporting Please support the project by reporting bugs that you find to help@sasview. org All the known bugs/feature requests can be found at: [URL] Regular developer builds are also available from [URL] if you wish to test the very latest (most likely unstable) versions of SasView. New Features This beta release adds support for the magnetic and multilevel models of 3. 1. 2 along with a host of bug fixes found in the alpha. Model package changes and improvements All 3. 1. 2 models now available in new interface Old custom models should now still work '''NOTE:''' These will be deprecated in a future version. Old custom models should be converted to the new model format which is now the same as the built in models and offers much better support. Custom model editor now creates new style models Custom model editor supports better error checking Documentation improvements Continued general cleanup Other improvements/additions Support for new canSAS 2 D data files added Plot axes range can now be set manually as well as by zooming Plot annotations can now be moved around after being placed on plot. The active optimizer is now listed on the top of the fit panel. Linear fits now update qmin and max when the x scale limits are changed. Also the plot range no longer resets after a fit.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this major version release is a {{significant}} restructuring of the way models work to address {{one of the biggest}} issues identified by the community: the difficulty of adding complex custom models. With this release all models are essentially treated the same within the computational framework. The "built-in" models have been separated out into an independent sasmodels package. Custom models continue to be discovered by placing them in the user plugin directory. All models consist of 1 or optionally 2 files: a model. py file containing much of the details (name, parameters, etc) and either the methods for computing intensity or links to an optional model. c which contains the computational code. All models, whether from sasmodels package or in the plugins directory are treated the same by the SasView application. Other things of note in this release: 	Support for openCL means that running on macs will automatically use GPUs or multiple CPU if they exist. This is true for most windows machines as well, but in some cases the user will need to download and install the openCL drivers for their computer. 	All model documentation has been reviewed and updated 	A number of other minor bugs and improvement New Features Model package changes and improvements 	All 3. 1. 2 models now available in new interface 	 		NB: RPA model is currently not available, but will be made available again later in the next point release. 	 	 	Most old custom models should now still work 	 		NOTE These will be deprecated in a future version. Old custom models should be converted to the new model format which is now the same as the built in models and offers much better support.

30|$|Smartphones {{have changed}} the {{convenience}} of everyday life and promises to facilitate core biomedical research analysis. To materialize this for research, we created DNA 2 App, a free standalone native Android and iOS mobile application that analyzes nucleic acid and amino acid sequences. Boasting a built-in database of more than 240 restriction sites and the amino acid codon table, the app allows sequences to be reverse complemented, translated in all 3 frames and searched for restriction sites, and their GC content and melting point can be calculated. Supplemented by the features of exportation to FASTA format and <b>copying</b> <b>to</b> <b>clipboard,</b> results can be kept or easily stored and communicated. Combined, these features increase the ease and convenience of commonly used sequence analyses that every scientist can carry in their pockets.|$|R

5000|$|A {{clipboard}} {{manager is}} a computer program that adds functionality to an operating system's clipboard. Many clipboards provide only one buffer for the [...] "copy and paste" [...] function, and it is overwritten by each new [...] "copy" [...] operation.

40|$|An update {{has been}} {{performed}} to software {{designed to do}} very rapid automated measurements of craters created in sandy substrates by rocket exhaust on liftoff. The previous software was optimized for pristine lab geometry and lighting conditions. This software has been enhanced to include a section for manual measurements of crater parameters; namely, crater depth, crater full width at half max, and estimated crater volume. The tools provide a very rapid method to measure these manual parameters to ease the burden of analyzing large data sets. This software allows for rapid quantization of the rocket crater parameters where automated methods may not work. The progress of spreadsheet data is continuously saved so that data is never lost, and data can be <b>copied</b> <b>to</b> <b>clipboards</b> and pasted <b>to</b> other software for analysis. The volume estimation of a crater {{is based on the}} central max depth axis line, and the polygonal shape of the crater is integrated around that axis...|$|R
50|$|WhizFolders allows {{to manage}} your {{information}} in two-panes--the left pane being a hierarchical list of note titles and the right-pane contains the detail or text of the selected note in the list.

When the user gives focus to the input by left- or right-clicking it, tabbing etc. the control script gets the data that should be copied by calling the OnGetLiveClipboardData function. This callback function is implemented by the page developer and returns an instance of LiveClipboardClass containing the data that should be <b>copied</b> <b>to</b> the <b>clipboard.</b> Next, the control script serializes this data <b>to</b> the Live <b>Clipboard</b> XML format, which it sets as {{the value of the}} input element and selects.|$|R

5000|$|The paste {{board is}} one of the most {{powerful}} (and unusual) features. The user chooses a document to [...] "use as paste board".

The resulting combined text can then be used as any other text, and searched to reuse clippings from days or weeks ago.|$|R
50|$|Some malware can steal private keys for bitcoin wallets {{allowing}} the bitcoins {{themselves to be}} stolen. The most common type searches computers for cryptocurrency wallets to upload to a remote server {{where they can be}} cracked and their coins stolen. Many of these also log keystrokes to record passwords, often avoiding the need to crack the keys. A different approach detects when a bitcoin address is <b>copied</b> <b>to</b> a <b>clipboard</b> and quickly replaces it with a different address, tricking people into sending bitcoins to the wrong address. This method is effective because bitcoin transactions are irreversible.|$|R
5000|$|The {{discretionary}} labelling mechanism added security {{labels to}} files, application {{windows and the}} clipboard. The user's desktop display was augmented with a stripe {{across the top of}} the screen. This showed the security label of the application window that had focus and the security label of the clipboard. When data was <b>copied</b> <b>to</b> the <b>clipboard</b> the clipboard label was set to that of the source application window. When data was copied from the clipboard the destination application window's label [...] "floated up" [...] to the label of the new data. The user was free to change the label of a window or the clipboard at any time.|$|R
50|$|Character Map is {{a utility}} {{included}} with Microsoft Windows operating systems {{and is used}} to view the characters in any installed font, to check what keyboard input (Alt code) is used to enter those characters, and <b>to</b> <b>copy</b> characters <b>to</b> the <b>clipboard</b> in lieu of typing them.
