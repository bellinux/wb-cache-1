40|$|The <b>compressor</b> <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> for a {{refrigerator}} has the function to intermittently control {{the flow of}} refrigerants in a compressor. This part, as a high precision component, must satisfy severe conditions for dimensional tolerances, such as flatness, roughness. The plate with 2 mm thickness is made of cold rolled steel, and has the inner step by the depth of 0. 1 mm. The core of precision forming technologies for the component is in forging processes for the step, similar to coining processes. In this study, process conditions for the precision forming of the component are suggested through finite element analyses, as part of computer aided engineering. The research {{was focused on the}} FE analysis for the forging among progressive forming processes, which include forging(coining), piercing, blanking. Since the forming process is one of bulk metal forming processes, the material is assumed to be rigid plastic in the analysis. The variations of the part precision predicted by the finite element analyses have been analyzed, which are caused by the changes of process conditions and process orders. Two dimensional analyses have been performed simplifying the geometry into axisymmetric shape with a central hole. As a fracture model, the modification of the criterion presented by Cockroft and Latham has been applied into the simulations of shearing phenomenon in piercing process. The effectivenes...|$|E

40|$|LectureThe {{operation}} of a reciprocating compressor is {{closely linked to the}} performance of its valves in terms of life and efficiency. Most operators report that the most significant cause of forced outages of reciprocating compressors is related to valve failures. In designing a reciprocating <b>compressor</b> <b>valve,</b> desirable functional attributes include good sealing, rapid opening and closing, sustained high flow area and low flow resistance, minimum bouncing upon impact, toleration of impact forces and high temperatures, and low flow resistance. Proper design choices, such as material, mass, spring constant, lift, and flow area will maximize the success of the design. However, simple passive valves do not tolerate wide operating ranges well, often suffering from valve leakage at low pressure ratios and reduced valve life at higher pressure ratios. Valve failures can be divided into two major categories, environmental and mechanical. As impact velocities increase due to higher valve lift or valve operation at off-design conditions, the velocities cause excessive impact stresses and an accelerated damage rate to the valve. Some mechanical causes can be controlled with a good design of the valve components, although the design of a valve is usually optimized for a single design point based on the fixed mass, stiffness, and damping of the design. To better understand the factors that affect reciprocating <b>compressor</b> <b>valve</b> performance and life, a research program was undertaken to systematically investigate the physical behavior of <b>valve</b> <b>plates</b> during <b>compressor</b> operation. The <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> life of a reciprocating compressor is generally considered to be a function of the plate?s cyclic kinematics, transient stresses, and material properties.

The investigation relates the impact fatigue lifetime of the valve leaves that {{is the heart of}} the compressor, with the working temperature, material type (carbon steel, stainless steel and improved stainless steel grade) and tumbling duration after the manufacturing process.

The goals of this research project are to identify {{the characteristics of the}} stress wave propagation and reflections in a <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> in order to obtain some fundamental understanding of valve failures due to impact. ^ The analytical solution to this problem is based on the method of transformations and the Cagniard method. A Green 2 ̆ 7 s function is formulated for a vertical point load on the elastic half-space (Lamb 2 ̆ 7 s problem) since the mathematical model of the half-space is easier to handle than that of the infinite plate. A numerical solution is obtained by evaluating the complex integral equations of the Green 2 ̆ 7 s function. A simple and efficient convolution scheme is developed for numerically extending this point {{solution to the problem of}} impact pressure distribution. A superposition algorithm is developed for the purpose of obtaining the displacements and stresses of the plate interior by utilizing the half-space solutions. The superposition method consists of two steps to satisfy the free boundary conditions of the plate, which is a unique feature of the algorithm. Several numerical results are presented for the half-space and infinite plate. ^ The three dimensional stress wave solution is compared with the one dimensional solution for certain limiting cases. The agreement of the two solutions is quite excellent. ^ The stress reversal phenomenon at the free boundary of the plate and the stress fluctuation near the S wave front indicate that the plate may fail earlier than expected by using conventional S-N curves. Thus, it is suggested that new S-N curves which incorporate the impact loading be constructed for a better <b>compressor</b> <b>valve</b> life prediction. ...|$|R
