5|$|Selfe {{achieved}} {{international recognition}} in 1861 when leading British journal The Engineer published illustrations of his designs {{for one of}} the first refrigerating machines. One such machine was installed behind the Royal Hotel in George Street in Sydney's ice-works– one of the world's earliest commercial refrigeration plants. The decades following Selfe's arrival in Australia were watershed years in the development of refrigeration technology, and he was closely involved with its evolution. The introduction of refrigeration to the colony revolutionised farming, allowing the expansion of settlement, and made possible the export of meat and dairy products. In Sydney itself, refrigeration changed <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> and led to the eventual demise of city dairies. Selfe became an international authority on refrigeration engineering; he wrote articles and eventually a definitive textbook on the subject, published in the US in 1900.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{despite these}} {{benefits}} societies {{have to be}} aware that with increasing economic freedom they will have to face going through a phase of increasing inequality, which basically is a result of decreased redistribution, as well as other negative effects from economic liberalization, i.e., running of local enterprises out of business, takeover of competitive firms, enforcing of interests of foreign companies, dependence on foreign capital, deteriorating work rights, harmful manufacturing for the environment, introducing of <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> that are not favorable for consumers, as well as endangerment for survival of national cultures.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} contemporary {{dimension to}} misrepresentations is the statutory regulation of business, and enforcement measures by the Office of Fair Trading against unfair trade practices. Typically consumers {{do not understand}} legal complexities and {{have little incentive to}} litigate over small claims. Statute may also strengthen enforcement of consumer protection by providing criminal or regulatory sanctions. The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 ss 1-4 say that not only false, but also misleading statements about products are prohibited. An early example is found in Robertson v Dicicco where it was held that describing a vehicle as a ‘beautiful car’ was implicitly saying it was fit for purpose. Though the exterior was attractive, it was still a misrepresentation when the car did not work. Similarly the Consumer Protection Act 1987 ss 20-21 create an offence for giving misleading information about the prices of goods and services, such as banking or insurance. On top of this the Unfair <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive, give a broad principle based jurisdiction to courts and the OFT to clamp down on misleading practices or omissions by businesses.|$|E

25|$|The {{education}} and training of the large workforce, the attempts to standardise manufacturing and <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> and the moderating of commercial rivalry between supply companies prompted the founding of associations of gas managers, first in Scotland in 1861. A British Association of Gas Managers was formed in 1863 in Manchester and this, after a turbulent history, became {{the foundation of the}} Institute of Gas Engineers (IGE). In 1903, the reconstructed Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) initiated courses for students of gas manufacture in the City and Guilds of London Institute. The IGE was granted the Royal Charter in 1929. Universities were slow to respond {{to the needs of the}} industry and it was not until 1908 that the first Professorship of Coal Gas and Fuel Industries was founded at the University of Leeds. In 1926, the Gas Light and Coke Company opened Watson House adjacent to Nine Elms Gas Works. At first, this was a scientific laboratory. Later it included a centre for training apprentices but its major contribution to the industry was its gas appliance testing facilities, which were made available to the whole industry, including gas appliance manufacturers. Using this facility, the industry established not only safety but also performance standards for both the manufacture of gas appliances and their servicing in customers' homes and commercial premises.|$|E

2500|$|The 1997 {{criminal}} code codified {{provisions in the}} 1991 Decision, establishing a system of controls over social place, specifically places of leisure and entertainment. The {{ultimate goal is to}} stop managers and workers within the predominantly male-run and male-patronised hospitality and service industry from profiting from and/or encouraging the prostitution of others. Government intervention in commercial recreation has found concrete expression {{in the form of the}} 1999 [...] "Regulations concerning the management of public places of entertainment". The provisions proscribe a range of <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> that characterise the activities of female [...] "hostesses". These laws have been further reinforced via the introduction of localised licensing measures that bear directly on the interior spatial organisation of recreational venues.|$|E
2500|$|Under EU law (Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices)</b> the {{criminal}} offence of Unfair Trading is committed if (a) 'it contains false information {{and is therefore}} untruthful or in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer, even if the information is factually correct', (b) 'it omits material information that the average consumer needs [...] [...] [...] and thereby causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision {{that he would not}} have taken otherwise' or (c) 'fails to identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice [...] [...] [...] [...] causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Protection of European {{consumers}} {{has been}} {{a central part of}} developing the EU internal market. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 169 enables the EU to follow the ordinary legislative procedure to protect consumers [...] "health, safety and economic interests" [...] and promote rights to [...] "information, education and to organise themselves in order to safeguard their interests". All member states may grant higher protection, and a [...] "high level of consumer protection" [...] is regarded as a fundamental right. Beyond these general principles, and outside specific sectors, there are four main Directives: the Product Liability Directive 1985, Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993, Unfair <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive 2005 and the Consumer Rights Directive 2011, requiring information and cancellation rights for consumers. As a whole, the law is designed to ensure that consumers in the EU are entitled to the same minimum rights wherever they shop, and largely follows inspiration from theories of consumer protection developed in California and the Consumer Bill of Rights proclaimed by John F. Kennedy in 1962. The Court of Justice has continually affirmed that the need for more consumer rights (than in commercial contracts) both because consumers tend to lack information, and they have less bargaining power.|$|E

2500|$|Europe's {{shortcomings}} on {{the topics}} of law & order, human-rights and <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> has diminished the European Union discourse on normative behaviour and practices : concerns expressed by the United Nations regarding the treatment of migrants & asylum seekers, shelving of cases of brutality by law & order officers, human trafficking, instances of racial profiling, opacity regarding enquiries at detention centres and of child abuse (Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre, Catholic Church sexual abuse cases, Marc Dutroux Belgian paedophile trafficking network, Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal), money laundering activities by criminal gangs, half-hearted investigations into participation by several EU-28 countries in the CIA extraordinary rendition programme, inconclusive inquiries into the illegal use of torture by or {{in the presence of}} European special forces and intelligence operatives at 'black sites', revelations of mass surveillance programmes which indiscriminately target the private lives of ordinary citizens, feeble prosecutions against institutions and individuals responsible for business manipulations and market distortions (price-fixings, ententes, cartels, valuations, ratings, statutory labellings and subsidies misuse by oligopolies), political complaisance towards assets sheltered by HNWI in fiscal-havens and charities (trusts & foundations), aggressive tax avoidance by corporations through profits transfer pricing arrangements, missing trader VAT fraud, money-laundering through European banks using fake-invoice trade-based techniques, continuation of institutionalized discrimination directed at ethnic groups (Rights of the Roma in the European Union and eviction of Chagossians), employment discrimination against minorities, homophobia, nepotism, etc., ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{element of}} the urban sector reform was the {{decision}} to improve <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> of ONEA through a short-term performance-based service contract with a private company. The international bid for this five-year service contract was won by the French private operator Veolia in January 2001, {{two months before the}} World Bank’s announcement of a new US$70 million credit for water supply in Ouagadougou. The contract covered the management of customer service and bill collections on behalf of ONEA, but kept the technical operation of the system and the supervision of the contract {{in the hands of the}} public utility. The expatriates worked as deputies to local managers and the international operator had mostly an advisory role. Yet because of the performance-based nature of the contract, it also had a clear financial stake in the success of the technical assistance provided. According to a World Bank study, “the staff sent by the international operator proved to be seasoned professionals with many years of hands-on operational experience.” With their help ONEA’s commercial performance further improved, although this took some time. The collection ratio decreased during the first two years and improved only afterward, slightly increasing beyond the pre contract performance in year three, reaching 93 percent in year four and 95 percent in year five. In December 2008 ONEA became the first public water utility in Sub-Saharan Africa to be IS0 9001-certified. The World Bank today considers ONEA “a mature corporation, similar in all respects to a private corporation.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that [...] "selling arrangements" [...] would be presumed to {{not fall into}} TFEU article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected {{them in the same}} manner in fact. In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as [...] "in law and in fact" [...] it was an equally applicable [...] "selling arrangement" [...] (not something that alters a product's content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so {{did not need to be}} justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect [...] "in fact" [...] particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were [...] "the only effective form of promotion enabling [...] to penetrate" [...] the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' [...] "traditional social practices and to local habits and customs" [...] to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other's standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice. The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory [...] "race to the bottom", while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent.|$|E
