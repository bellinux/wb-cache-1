50|$|HP LTO Gen.1 drives have a {{cleaning}} strategy that will prevent the drive from actually using the cleaning tape {{if it is}} not needed. In a change of strategy, HP LTO Gen 2, 3 and 4 drives will always clean when a Universal <b>Cleaning</b> <b>Cartridge</b> is inserted, whether the drive requires cleaning or not.|$|E
50|$|Although {{keeping a}} tape drive clean is important, normal {{cleaning}} cartridges are abrasive and frequent use will shorten the drive's lifespan. LTO drives have an internal tape head cleaning brush that is activated when a cartridge is inserted. When {{a more thorough}} cleaning is required the drive signals this on its display and/or via Tape Alert flags. <b>Cleaning</b> <b>cartridge</b> lifespan is usually from 15 to 50 cleanings. There are 2 basic methods of initiating a cleaning of a drive: robot cleaning and software cleaning.|$|E
5000|$|For some inkjet printers, {{monochrome}} ink {{sets are}} available {{either from the}} printer manufacturer or from third-party suppliers. These allow the inkjet printer {{to compete with the}} silver-based photographic papers traditionally used in black-and-white photography, and provide the same range of tones: neutral, [...] "warm" [...] or [...] "cold". When switching between full-color and monochrome ink sets, it is necessary to flush out the old ink from the print head with a <b>cleaning</b> <b>cartridge.</b> Special software or at least a modified device driver are usually required, to deal with the different color mapping.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the data cartridges, there are also Universal <b>Cleaning</b> <b>Cartridges</b> (UCC), which work with all drives.|$|R
50|$|Every LTO {{cartridge}} has a cartridge {{memory chip}} inside it. It {{is made up}} of 511, 255, or 128 blocks of memory, where each block is 32 bytes for a total of 16 KB for LTO-6 and 7; 8 KB for LTO-4 and 5; and 4 KB on LTO-1 to 3 and <b>cleaning</b> <b>cartridges.</b> This memory can be read or written, one block at a time, via a non-contacting passive 13.56 MHz RF interface. This memory is used to identify tapes, to help drives discriminate between different generations of the technology, and to store tape-use information.|$|R
50|$|Different printer {{manufacturers}} {{use different}} spittoon technology. Hewlett-Packard uses {{a small plastic}} tray below the <b>cleaning</b> station and <b>cartridge</b> storage dock, while Epson uses an absorbent fiber pad in a large shallow tray below {{the width of the}} printer.|$|R
40|$|Lower than {{expected}} plant performance had been observed at Al-Birk SWRO plant, capacity 2270 m 3 /d, since its start-up in 1983. Initially, {{the plant was}} operated on DuPont B- 10 6840 and presently is being operated on B- 10 6835 and B- 9 polyamide hollow fine fiber membrane in the 1 st and second stages, respectively. Though the initial performance of the B- 10 membrane (1983) was acceptable, but within three months of operation, due to membrane fouling, the differential pressure across membranes (Dp) exceeded its maximum limit value of 4 bar, along with a considerable drop in both salt rejection as well as plant productivity. The intensity of fouling became so alarming that it necessitated frequent membrane <b>cleaning,</b> <b>cartridge</b> filter (CF) replacement, at nearly 10 days interval, with a considerable loss in production. To overcome this fouling problem, believed to be membrane bio-fouling, one alternative approach is to operate the plant by {{the replacement of the}} B- 10 membrane, which does not tolerate chlorine, with the chlorine tolerant Toyobo HB 9155 HFF cellulose triacetate (CTA) membrane. The latter membrane is characterized by its ability to repulse the organic foulants, Added advantage to this alternative selection is that DuPont no longer produces B- 10 membrane. Moreover, the Toyobo membrane is the only membrane now available as replacement of B- 10 membrane without syste...|$|E

50|$|The {{changes are}} {{in most cases}} caused by small toner {{particles}} in {{the surface of the}} OPC not fully charged and unable to transfer to the paper. Such partially untransferred particles of toner end up being collected by the <b>cartridge</b> <b>cleaning</b> system and sent to the waste bin.

5000|$|The Imperial Japanese Army {{introduced}} the Type 30 rifle in 1897. However, the weapon had numerous shortcomings, which were highlighted by combat {{experience in the}} early stages of the Russo-Japanese War. These included bursting cartridges, a poorly designed lock in which excess gunpowder tended to accumulate, burning the face of the shooter, frequent misfires, jamming, difficulty in <b>cleaning,</b> and <b>cartridge</b> extraction. Major Kijiro Nambu undertook a redesign of the Type 30 rifle, which was introduced in 1906. Nambu reduced the number of parts making up the Type 30's bolt from nine to six and at that same time simplified manufacture and disassembly of the bolt without the need of tools. A dust cover was added because of experiences in the Russo-Japanese War that left rifles inoperable from dust. The weapon was produced in several locations: ...|$|R
50|$|American Standard's ActiClean toilet cleans {{and remove}} stains {{by a simple}} press of a button. A clean cycle is {{selected}} by pressing the corresponding button, with two cleaning cycles of choice: a Quick Clean that takes one minute; or a Deep Clean that offers an extended, 10-minute cleaning cycle. After pressing a button, a <b>cartridge</b> <b>cleaning</b> solution travels through the designated channel in the tank and is mixed with water. Then the cleaner powerfully enters the bowl, scrubbing {{the walls of the}} toilet bowl. The cleaner will then saturate in the bowl for a set amount of time, depending on the cycle selected. Last, the system will automatically switch to the rinse cycle, siphoning the cleaning agent and rinsing the bowl. The result is a sparkling clean bowl.|$|R
40|$|At {{this time}} {{there is a need}} for new {{fabrication}} techniques for engineering complex biological structures related to regenerative medicine, in vitro tissue analysis, and pharmaceutical testing with the purpose of placing specific cells in specific target locations. Right now, there is no enough conventional cell seeding methods that can achieve it. In order to achieve it, bio-fabrication, which is a delivery mechanism capable of placing biomaterials, cells, and bioactive macromolecules in specific target locations, comes to play an important role in this area. Among different approaches, bioprinting is one of the most useful processes that use drop-on-demand delivery mechanisms capable of fabricating biological structures. This research presents an experimental study where six factors with two levels each one, are involved in the bioprinting process that are analyzed using the Design of Experiments (DOE) and Taguchi Method in order to find those critical factors that are significant into process that may require some improvements. The six factors with their levels considered in this experiment are: Suspension Method (Medium, PBS), <b>Cartridge</b> <b>Cleaning</b> Method (Pressure, Sonicator), Density (cells/ml) (500 K, 1000 K), Printer (HP 640 C, HP 330), Dot Size (mm 2) (3. 46, 15. 76), and Printing Times (1, 5). Furthermore, it is expected to find the optimal operating conditions, that put together can reach the maximum output which in this case is to reach the greatest amount of printed cells. Finally, confirmation runs are conducted to test the accuracy of each approach to determine which method is better. ...|$|R
