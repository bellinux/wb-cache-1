40|$|Voting has {{traditionally}} been performed by <b>casting</b> <b>paper</b> ballots in public polling places. However, advancements in computer technology in the latest decades have enabled voters to cast their votes electronically. By 2016, eleven different countries have made various trials enabling voters to cast votes on the Internet using personal devices. End-to-end verifiability is regarded by election experts as an important property for retaining democratic principles in Internet elections. Nevertheless, the Norwegian Internet voting trial of 2013 has proven that preserving democratic principles is possible without a complete end-to-end verifiable system. Consequently, this property {{may not always be}} a necessary requirement for all Internet voting systems. The investigations of this project indicate that verifiability can increase transparency and enable Internet elections to be conducted using multiple technologies, e. g. smartphones for voting, blockchain innovations and deploying Internet voting systems in the cloud...|$|E

Fekner creates multiple versions {{of work in}} entirely different media and will use whatever means are necessary to communicate a vision or message, and whose work changes as that vision expands.

Fekner's stencil Wheels Over Indian Trails greeted motorists and international travelers arriving in New York City at the Pulaski Bridge Queens Midtown Tunnel from 1979 to 1990. The message remained untouched for eleven years, until Earth Day 1990, when Mr. Fekner, feeling the piece had run its course, painted over it.|$|R
