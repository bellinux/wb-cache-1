40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at generalizing the {{theoretical}} provisions on <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing in enterprise: to clarify the place <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing within the management system, constituents, goals, tasks, and functions. The <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing was considered in terms of concepts such as management of enterprise, management of marketing, operative management <b>of</b> marketing, <b>controlling,</b> strategic and operational <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing, and operative management of marketing costs. The constituents and tools <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing at the strategic and the operational levels have been defined. The definition <b>of</b> operative <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing has been revised, which emphasizes managerial decision-making about marketing costs, taking account of current situation and optimality of such costs as to purposes of enterprise. A systematic approach to studying this issue provides a holistic view <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing within the enterprise management system. A study on the theoretical aspects <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing as a modern management concept {{will make it possible}} to approach the issue of decision-making on marketing activity in a holistic manner...|$|R

5|$|After Æthelstan's death, {{the men of}} York {{immediately}} {{chose the}} Viking king of Dublin, Olaf Guthfrithson (or his cousin, Anlaf Cuaran), as their king, and Anglo-Saxon <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the north, seemingly made safe by the victory of Brunanburh, collapsed. The reigns of Æthelstan's half-brothers Edmund (939–946) and Eadred (946–955) were largely devoted to regaining control. Olaf seized the east midlands, leading {{to the establishment of}} a frontier at Watling Street. In 941 Olaf died, and Edmund took back <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the east midlands, and then York in 944. Following Edmund's death York again switched back to Viking control, and it was only when the Northumbrians finally drove out their Norwegian Viking king Eric Bloodaxe in 954 and submitted to Eadred that Anglo-Saxon <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the whole of England was finally restored.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some parts}} of Waterfall Gully were {{transferred}} from the District Council of East Torrens (now the Adelaide Hills Council) to the City of Burnside in 1856 when the suburb's current boundaries were established, {{the government of the}} day chose to retain <b>control</b> <b>of</b> a significant portion of Waterfall Gully. Thus it was not until 1884 that the remaining land was transferred to the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the Burnside Council, eventuating largely through the efforts of Samuel Davenport and G. F.

5|$|As Democrats took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the House in 1875, Randall was {{considered}} among the candidates for Speaker of the House. Many in the caucus hesitated, however, believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money question. His leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him, as well. Randall was also occupied by an intra-party battle with William A. Wallace for <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Wallace, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874, was weakened by rumors {{that he had taken}} bribes from the railroads while a member of the State Senate. Randall wanted <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the Democratic machine statewide, and the Wallace faction's vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity. In January 1875, he had friends in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace's clique, which ultimately turned state Democratic leaders against the senator. At the state Democratic convention in September 1875, Randall (with the help of his old ally, Squire McMullen) triumphed, putting his men in <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the state party.|$|E
