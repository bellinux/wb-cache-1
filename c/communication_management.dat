40|$|The <b>management</b> <b>communication</b> {{facilitates}} the <b>management</b> {{process as a}} whole, in a certain organizational culture and with major implications in the organizational climate. By studying management and organizational culture, one may emphasize {{a whole range of}} aspects, from performance to dramatic situations generated and developed by the lack of communication and understanding. Therefore, <b>management</b> <b>communication</b> and culture plays an important role. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to highlight the relations between the <b>management</b> <b>communication</b> and <b>management</b> culture on one hand, and between <b>management</b> <b>communication</b> and organizational culture and climate on the other hand in the Romanian organizations. Future studies may expand the research area on the <b>management</b> of <b>communication</b> process in particular case studies...|$|R

25|$|Organizational climate or structure: The overall <b>communication,</b> <b>management</b> style, and {{participation}} among groups of employees are variables to be considered.

50|$|Petronio's <b>communication</b> privacy <b>management</b> (CPM) {{theory is}} built on Altman's dialecticalconception of privacy {{as a process of}} opening and closing a {{boundary}} to others. Altman and Taylor's social penetration theory focused on self-disclosure as the primary way to develop close relationships. However, openness {{is only part of the}} story. We also have a desire for privacy. When Petronio first developed this theory in 1991, it was called <b>communication</b> boundary <b>management.</b> In 2002, she renamed it to <b>communication</b> privacy <b>management,</b> underscoring private disclosure is the main thrust of the theory.|$|R

25|$|The {{university}} {{spent nearly}} $380,000,000 million in 2005-06 on research, capping {{a long history}} of productive research. In 1877, botany professor William J. Beal performed the first documented genetic crosses to produce hybrid corn, which led to increased yields. MSU dairy professor G. Malcolm Trout invented the process for the homogenization of milk in the 1930s. In the 1960s, MSU scientists developed cisplatin, a leading cancer fighting drug. Today Michigan State continues its research with facilities such as the U.S. Department of Energy-sponsored MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory and a particle accelerator called the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. In 2004, scientists at the Cyclotron produced and observed a new isotope of the element germanium, called Ge-60. In that same year, Michigan State, in consortium with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the government of Brazil, broke ground on the 4.1-meter Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR) in the Andes Mountains of Chile. The consortium telescope will allow the Physics & Astronomy department to study galaxy formation and origins.
