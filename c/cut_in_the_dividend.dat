The housing recession led to a <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dividend</b> in 1990 and in 1991 Crosby was acquired by Berkeley Group Holdings. The {{business was}} substantially expanded, concentrating on city centre development from Birmingham north to Newcastle. As part of Berkeley’s restructuring Crosby was sold on deferred terms to its management in 2003; Lend Lease Corporation then bought it in 2005 for circa £240 million. Shortly after the takeover the company was renamed Crosby Lend Lease.|$|E

Analysis of data from a discount brokerage shows that dividends are withdrawn from household portfolios {{at a much higher}} rate than capital gains, further suggesting that the form of returns matters for consumption and that investors pursue a mental accounting strategy to "consume income, not principal.

40|$|Dividend {{distributions}} {{provide us}} with an adequate framework for detecting and analysing the activity of short term traders. If the price adjustment after <b>the</b> <b>dividend</b> distribution {{is not enough to}} compensate for <b>the</b> distributed <b>dividend,</b> this means that there is an opportunity to make additional gains through arbitrage, that will be explored by rational short term traders. To put it differently, the existence of a strong arbitrage activity will force the stock price to reach a new equilibrium position. If this short term trading hypothesis is true, then we should observe the following: (i) an abnormal positive transactions volume <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dividend</b> period; (ii) a negative relation between the intensity of trading activity and transactions costs; (iii) a positive relation between the intensity of trading activity and the liquidity of stocks.
