5|$|Early {{difficulties}} with staff conditions and wages, {{which the company}} was attempting to simplify from the complex <b>contracts</b> arranged by LCBS, led to strike action by staff in February 1988. Performance levels on contracted routes were already below those expected by the local councils who had awarded LCNE the <b>contracts,</b> and by London Regional Transport. Following the strike three of the company's London <b>contracts</b> (routes 292, 298 and 313) were terminated and awarded to independents.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to prevent the game losing players to {{counties}} or other commitments such as jobs, {{it was suggested that}} central <b>contracts</b> should be introduced. This was done in June 2009, with the first two going to Trent Johnston and Alex Cusack. The number of full-time <b>contracts</b> was expanded to six in January 2010 with support for a further nine players; the <b>contracts</b> were split into three categories. In January 2012 the number of <b>contracts</b> was increased to 23, and coach Phil Simmons highlighted the process of becoming professional as an important factor in the team's success.|$|E

The decree {{changed the nature of}} these <b>contracts,</b> so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures <b>contracts</b> had been transformed into options <b>contracts.</b> This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if it became clear to investors that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E
