40|$|AbstractSoftware testing {{plays an}} {{important}} role in software development because it can minimize the development cost. Software testing approaches are divided into three parts i. e. code based testing, specification based testing and model based testing. In model based testing, the testing begins at design phase. So, early detection of faults can be achieved by using this approach further reducing time, cost and efforts of the developer to a large extent. In this paper we propose a technique for generating test cases using both UML sequence diagram and state chart diagram. Our approach is to convert Sequence Diagram into Sequence Graph and then to convert State Chart Diagram into State <b>chart</b> <b>Graph.</b> Finally System Testing Graph (SYTG) is formed by combining the two Graphs. From the graphs different control flow sequences also called test cases are identified and then optimized using evolutionary Algorithm, called Genetic Algorithm. Although State chart did better at revealing unit level faults and sequence diagram is better at removing integration level faults, but after integrating the two graphs, generated test cases are appropriate for system testing and to identify Error handling, correctness, pre-post condition faults, interaction, message sequence faults and scenario faults...|$|E

40|$|Software testing plays a very {{important}} role in the development process because it is an essential mean of providing reliability and quality to any software. Designing and execution of test cases consumes lot of time since it requires planning and resources manually. To overcome this it is highly required to automate the generation of test cases. UML, is a standard modeling language which supports object oriented technology. It is generally used to depict the analysis and design specification of software development. UML models are an essential and a rich source of information for test case design. In this thesis, we present a testing methodology which is used to generate the unit test cases from UML state chart diagram for an industrial application. Firstly, we discussed about the CIM, an industrial application which is used for transforming an Idea through a collaborative interaction into such a state so that the idea becomes patentable. This application provides a platform to the people in industry to encourage and enhance their invention skills for an enterprise. Next we proposed a testing approach to generate unit test cases for the phases of CIM application using UML state chart diagram. UML model provides a lot of information which can be used for testing. In our approach, firstly the state chart diagram is constructed for CIM application. Then the adjacency matrix is generated and subsequently transform the state chart diagram into a UML state <b>chart</b> <b>graph.</b> Then we traverse the graph using adjacency matrix by using DFS. Therefore test sequences are generated. Then we apply the node coverage minimization technique to generate the test cases so that maximum coverage is achieved...|$|E

Simply put, Geographic Information Systems manage, analyze, <b>chart,</b> <b>graph,</b> and map spatial information. GIS can be broken down into two main categories, urban GIS and natural resource GIS. Further still, natural resource GIS can be broken down into six sub-categories, agriculture, forestry, wildlife, catchment management, archaeology, and geology/mining. Agriculture GIS has several applications, such as agricultural capability analysis, land conservation, market analysis, or whole farming planning. Forestry GIs can be used for timber assessment and management, harvest scheduling and planning, environmental impact assessment, and pest management.

At the outset, I was given goals and expectations from my branch and from my mentor with regards to the further implementation of GIs. Those goals are as follows: (1) Continue the development of GIS for the underground structures. (2) Extract and export annotated data from AutoCAD drawing files and construct a database (to serve as a prototype for future work). (3) Examine existing underground record drawings to determine existing and non-existing underground tanks. Once this data was collected and analyzed, I set out on the task of creating a user-friendly database that could be assessed by all members of the branch. It was important that the database be built using programs that most employees already possess, ruling out most AutoCAD-based viewers. Therefore, I set out to create an Access database that translated onto the web using Internet Explorer as the foundation. After some programming, it was possible to view AutoCAD files and other GIS-related applications on Internet Explorer, while providing the user with a variety of editing commands and setting options. I was also given the task of launching a divisional website using Macromedia Flash and other web- development programs...|$|E
