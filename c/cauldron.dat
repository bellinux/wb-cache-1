5|$|The Queen (voiced by Susanne Blakeslee) is {{the main}} villain in the 2005 direct-to-video {{animated}} film Once Upon a Halloween, but appears only in the Witch version despite misleading cover art (furthermore, only her shadow is shown). In it, the Queen plots to conquer Halloween and asks her <b>cauldron</b> to show several villains to which one of them helps her in her plan. The <b>cauldron</b> also explains its origins as {{it is one of}} the cauldrons formerly owned by the three witches from The Black <b>Cauldron.</b> Eventually, the <b>cauldron</b> turns against the Wicked Queen and makes her vanish into nothingness.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of <b>Cauldron,</b> Palace {{employee}} Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in <b>Cauldron,</b> Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation. Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book.|$|E

5|$|Many {{years prior}} to the game's events, the world was {{controlled}} by King , who ruled the kingdom bearing his name. Originally a kind man, a spell to bring his people prosperity drained his goodness, causing him to turn into a vicious dictator who declared war on the rest of Erion. During his conquests, the <b>Cauldron</b> went wild and destroyed the kingdom in a single night — everyone was cursed and transformed into Pookas, while Valentine's kingdom was reduced to a wasteland. In the aftermath of Valentine's fall, Ragnanival and Ringford had become Erion's most powerful nations, while the other nations have become weak in comparison. At the game's opening, Ragnanival and Ringford are at war over the possession of the <b>Cauldron</b> in the wasteland of Valentine, as each see the <b>Cauldron</b> as too dangerous for the other to possess.|$|E
50|$|After Tang of Shang overthrew Jie of Xia, {{the nine}} tripod <b>cauldrons</b> {{were moved to}} the Shang capital at Yan. Later, when the Shang king Pan Geng moved his capital to Yin (殷), the <b>cauldrons</b> again went with him. Following the {{overthrow}} of the Shang Dynasty by the Zhou Dynasty, the new King Wu of Zhou put the nine tripod <b>cauldrons</b> on public display for the first time.|$|R
5000|$|The Nine Tripod <b>Cauldrons</b> (...) were ancient Chinese ritual <b>cauldrons.</b> They were {{ascribed}} to {{the foundation of the}} Xia (&thinsp;) by Yu the Great, using tribute metal presented by the governors of the Nine Provinces of ancient China.|$|R

It consists of <b>cauldrons</b> completely made of copper, as in centuries gone by. The distillation cycle is discontinuous. This means that the grape-pomace is put into the <b>cauldrons</b> and distilled using steam; after about three hours the <b>cauldrons</b> are unloaded and the cycle begins again. Visitors are welcome by appointment.|$|R
5|$|Palace Software {{developed}} <b>Cauldron</b> II {{for three}} home computers: Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. The game was first released for the Commodore 64, {{and then for}} the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. It was later re-released on the ZX Spectrum in 1989 by Telecomsoft under its Silverbird budget label. <b>Cauldron</b> II was also re-released with the first game as a compilation title for Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum computers.|$|E

5|$|Finally, the Torch {{is brought}} into the stadium, passed from athlete to athlete during the torch relay, until it reaches the last carrier; often a {{well-known}} athlete from the host nation, who lights {{the fire in the}} stadium's <b>cauldron.</b> Under IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic <b>cauldron</b> must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Another IOC rule states that the <b>cauldron</b> should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city. This was made evident during the opening ceremony for the 2010 Games in Vancouver. The venue chosen as the Olympic Stadium was BC Place, which at the time was an air-supported domed stadium. Since there was no way the <b>cauldron</b> could be displayed outside and also be seen at the stadium, two cauldrons were used. For the first torch lighting inside the stadium the organizers chose three-time speed skating medalist Catriona Le May Doan, Canadian Senator Nancy Greene, who won two medals for Canada at the 1968 Games, NBA star Steve Nash, a native of nearby Victoria, and hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, to each light one of four arms of the torch. Notably, Le May Doan's arm refused to light; this was later rectified during the closing ceremony when she got a second chance to light her part of the torch and succeeded.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} two days of the eruption, ice <b>cauldrons</b> were formed over the {{volcanic}} vents. Radar images reveal the development of these <b>cauldrons</b> in a 200 m thick ice cover within the summit caldera. They {{can also be used to}} document the subglacial and supraglacial passage of meltwater away from the eruption site. Research shows the eruption breached the ice surface four hours after the initial eruption onset, whilst meltwater release was characterised by accumulation and subsequent drainage, with most of the volcanic material in the ice <b>cauldrons</b> being drained in hyperconcentrated floods.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Ice <b>cauldrons</b> are {{depressions}} {{which form}} {{at the surface}} of ice sheets when an underlying subglacial lake empties, in particular when subglacial volcanic eruptions occur. Notable examples of such <b>cauldrons</b> occur {{on the surface of}} the Vatnajökull ice cap in Iceland. More generally, <b>cauldrons</b> will form when a subglacial lake empties during a jökulhlaup. The rate of subsidence of the ice surface is related to the rate at which the subglacial water empties from the lake. We use a viscous version of classical beam theory applied to the ice sheet to determine the relation between the subsidence rate and flood discharge. We use the results to make inferences concerning ring fracture spacings in <b>cauldrons,</b> the consequent effect on flood discharge dynamics and the likely nature of subsidence events in the Antarctic Ice Sheet. 1...|$|R
5|$|Speeches are given, {{formally}} {{opening the}} games. Finally, the Paralympic torch {{is brought into}} the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier—often a Paralympic athlete from the host nation—who lights the Paralympic flame in the stadium's <b>cauldron.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ancient chronicles mention {{two tests}} that Dutthagamani planned {{to find out}} these warriors' skill before the battle. For the first test, Dutthagamani asked the warriors to drink a large <b>cauldron</b> of toddy, {{intending}} to test their strength. When all others refused, Suranimala stepped forward and drank the entire <b>cauldron</b> without any effort. The second test was to test Nandimithra, {{the commander of the}} army. Dutthagamani had his royal elephant, Kandula, infuriated and set on Nandimithra. However, the warrior stood his ground and taking the elephant by its tusks, pushed it to the ground. Thus clearing all doubts as to the abilities and skill of his warriors, Dutthagamani sounded the war drums and raising his flags, started the assault to take Vijithapura.|$|E
5|$|The same <b>cauldron</b> {{was used}} as in the 1932 Summer Games. The {{orchestra}} played The Olympian composed and conducted by Philip Glass. The torch enters the stadium carried by Rafer Johnson, he completes a lap as mechanical steps rise {{from the center of}} the peristalses. He climbs the stairs and stands and faces the crowd as The Olympian is still being played. After a minute, he lights the gas powered Olympic rings that connect with the Olympic <b>cauldron.</b> The flame is lit to the cheers from the crowd. The athlete and judges oaths are taken and a children's chorus appears. They perform ode to joy.|$|E

5|$|After {{the second}} lacuna, Hymir {{is sitting in}} the boat, unhappy and totally silent, as they row back to shore. On shore, Hymir {{suggests}} that Thor should help him carry a whale back to his farm. Thor picks both the boat and the whales up, and carries it all back to Hymir's farm. After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir's head on Týr's mother's suggestion, Thor and Týr are given the <b>cauldron.</b> Týr cannot lift it, but Thor manages to roll it, and so with it they leave. Some distance from Hymir's home, an army of many-headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two, but are killed by the hammer of Thor. Although one of his goats is lame in the leg, the two manage to bring the <b>cauldron</b> back, have plenty of ale, and so, from then on, return to Ægir's for more every winter.|$|E
5|$|Delayed {{half a year}} by the {{defection}} of the Bluth group, The Fox and the Hound {{was released}} in 1981 after four years in production.

5|$|Designed by Steve Brown and Richard Leinfellner, <b>Cauldron</b> {{originated}} as {{a licensed}} video {{game of the}} horror film Halloween.

Mingella and Blobbelda lose to Banjo and Kazooie, getting crushed, but Gruntilda escapes. Banjo and Kazooie then reverse the effects of B.O.B., resurrecting both King Jingaling and Bottles, who celebrate at Bottles' house along with Klungo. Banjo and Kazooie enter {{the top of the}} fortress and defeat Gruntilda, destroying most of her body and the Hag 1 along with her. The two return to Bottles' house with their remaining friends (Jamjars, Mumbo, and Wumba) to find that everyone else has celebrated without them, much to their disappointment. They instead head to <b>Cauldron</b> Keep and play a game of hacky-sack with Gruntilda's head, who vows to have her revenge.|$|E
5|$|So, after Thor secures his goats at Egil's home, Thor and Týr go to Hymir's hall {{in search}} of a <b>cauldron</b> large enough to brew ale for them all. They arrive, and Týr sees his nine-hundred-headed {{grandmother}} and his gold-clad mother, the latter of which welcomes them with a horn. After Hymir—who is not happy to see Thor—comes in from the cold outdoors, Týr's mother helps them find a properly strong <b>cauldron.</b> Thor eats a big meal of two oxen (all the rest eat but one), and then goes to sleep. In the morning, he awakes and informs Hymir that he wants to go fishing the following evening, and that he will catch plenty of food, but that he needs bait. Hymir tells him to go get some bait from his pasture, which he expects should not be a problem for Thor. Thor goes out, finds Hymir's best ox, and rips its head off.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} <b>Cauldron</b> in 1985 {{prompted}} Palace Software {{to produce a}} sequel.

5000|$|At {{the time}} of the Shang Dynasty during the 2nd millennium&thinsp;, the tripod <b>cauldrons</b> came to symbolize the power and {{authority}} of the ruling dynasty with strict regulations imposed as to their use. Members of the scholarly gentry class were permitted to use one or three cauldrons; the ministers of state ( [...] , dàfū) five; the vassal lords seven; and only the sovereign Son of Heaven was entitled to use nine. The use of the nine tripod <b>cauldrons</b> to offer ritual sacrifices to the ancestors from heaven and earth was a major ceremonial occasion so that by natural progression the ding came to symbolize national political power and later to be regarded as a National Treasure. Sources state that two years {{after the fall of the}} Zhou Dynasty at the hands of what would become the Qin Dynasty the nine tripod <b>cauldrons</b> were taken from the Zhou royal palace and moved westward to the Qin capital at Xianyang. However, by the time Qin Shi Huang had eliminated the other six Warring States to become the first emperor of China in 221&thinsp;, the whereabouts of the nine tripod <b>cauldrons</b> were unknown.
