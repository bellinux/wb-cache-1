40|$|There is {{a debate}} in the {{literature}} as to whether young children’s categorization abilities are {{more closely related to}} their general productive vocabulary or their specific word knowledge. The present study examines this relationship in children 18 to 26 months of age. Specifically, it tests the hypothesis that children’s understanding of individual words is more closely related to their <b>category</b> <b>performance</b> than the overall size of their productive vocabulary. Twenty children at 19 months (range= 18 - 20 months) and 25 months of age (range= 24 - 26 months) participated in the study. Children’s <b>category</b> <b>performance</b> was assessed using an object manipulation task with novel objects. Half of the children received novel names for the novel objects, and half did not. Two measures were then assessed: children’s knowledge of the novel names in a comprehension test, and children’s productive vocabulary outside of the laboratory, as measured by a parental checklist. Consistent with previous findings, the results indicate that children with larger productive vocabularies show more advanced categorizing. More importantly, however, the data suggest that children who received names for the novel objects outperformed children who did not receive the names, regardless of the size of their productive vocabulary. These findings suggest that hearing object names help children categorize objects, and may be a better predictor of children’s <b>category</b> <b>performance</b> than their productive vocabulary...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The paper {{examines}} the moderating {{role of a}} purchasing function’s absorptive capacity (AC) {{on the relationship between}} the use of electronic purchasing tools and category level purchasing performance. The authors argue that an e-purchasing tool may not in itself positively influence performance unless combined with AC as a human interface to maximise its information and transactional improvement potential. Design/methodology/approach – Survey data collected from 297 procurement executives of large companies in ten countries are analysed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and hierarchical moderated regression. Findings – The results demonstrate few significant direct effects of e-purchasing tools on <b>category</b> <b>performance.</b> All performance measures studied are enhanced when dimensions of AC and their interactions with the e-purchasing tools are added. Specifically, buyer competence, manager competence and communications climate have performance-enhancing effects. In some cases, AC on its own appears to increase performance more than e-tools. Originality/value – This paper is the first to study the moderating effects of AC on the relationship between e-purchasing tool usage and <b>category</b> <b>performance.</b> Its findings support the view that simply implementing technology does not lead to performance improvements, but that a human interface is required to maximise the information and transactional improvement potential of e-purchasing tools...|$|E

40|$|The broad {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine how assortment factors and <b>category</b> <b>performance</b> are related within the context of specialty retailing. This study formulates two clusters of research questions. The first cluster of research questions focuses on product assortment in general, for example assortment variety and composition. The second cluster of research questions concentrates on a specific area of product assortment, that is, private label products. An organic retailer in Australia collaborates by providing its assortment records and sales reports. The Australian organic retailing industry is an ideal candidate for this study for 1) it is specialty retailing, and 2) the supply situation allows organic retailers considerable flexibility to experiment with different assortment compositions. This study analyses store level cross sub category data and, to supplement this, it conducts a qualitative study and collects field data. Included in the cross sub category analyses are approximately 140 to 180 organic sub categories. The results show that assortment variety has a positive influence on sub category sales. The strength of this positive relationship varies across different sub category types, for example food or non-food. For the private label analyses, the results show that, within the focal store, private label SKUs are more likely to be present in sub categories with larger sales and with supermarket competition present. This study also finds that a deeper manufacturer brand assortment hurts private label performance. This study contributes to a body of cross category empirical generalisations about the complex decisions retailers face by examining the effects of assortment decisions within the context of specialty retailing. It provides some clear empirical evidence for how assortment factors and sub <b>category</b> <b>performance</b> are related through an empirical investigation in a bricks and mortar retail environment. In addition, it tests the generalisability of extant private label research beyond the much discussed conventional supermarket industry and convenience consumer goods contexts.

Based on data from 19 food categories sold in 85 major supermarket chains operating in the largest 50 retail markets in the U. S, our analysis shows that the best performing retailers: (a) offer broader assortments, (b) have strong private label programs, (c) charge significantly lower everyday prices, and (d) use feature advertising to drive store traffic and display to increase in-store purchases. In addition, the best performing retailers also are more likely to engage in a formal category management process. Finally, we find that the impact of the price, promotion and assortment variables depends importantly on the role (staple, necessity, niche, or fill-in) that the particular category plays in the store's o [...] ...|$|E
