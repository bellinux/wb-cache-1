40|$|Biscogniauxia mediterranea is a {{widespread}} fungus that causes charcoal disease on cork oak and other hardwood hosts. It had been considered a secondary pathogen causing the disease only in stressed hosts. However, its frequency and severity have been increasing, inclusive in young trees without other decline signs and developing atypical symptoms. The present work aims to assess the fungus’ variability in the Mediterranean basin, following cork oak geographical distribution. A collection of 36 isolates originated from cork oak in Portugal and other Mediterranean countries, from other hosts and from trees with different ages and disease expression were analyzed by cultural characteristics, conidial dimensions, and growth rates at different temperatures and by microsatellite-primed PCR profiles. Clustering UPGMA analyses combining different parameters were preformed. All the approaches revealed high level of intraspecific polymorphism among Mediterranean isolates, not allowing relating the disease development with any analyzed features. The results highlighted the variability of this fungus that induces its adaptation ability in the present worrying scenario of climatic change.

40|$|Wooded grasslands are {{the most}} {{widespread}} agro-forestry systems in Europe, and {{are included in the}} Natura 2000 network due to their importance in biodiversity conservation. Similar to many man-made systems, long-term wooded grasslands conservation depends on sustainable use practices. Regeneration of the tree layer is indispensable to assure wooded grassland maintenance. Several studies in Spanish dehesas and Portuguese montados generated concerns regarding the long-term conservation of these agro-silvo-pastoral systems. In the present study, we tested if tree regeneration issues documented for the Iberian Peninsula also affected wooded grasslands located in another Mediterranean area inside and outside Natura 2000 network. The size structure of Quercus suber L. stands, and the abundance and height of seedlings and saplings were determined at farm and landscape scales, in grazed, grazed and tilled wooded grasslands, and non-grazed woodlands to test the compatibility of management type for tree regeneration. A frequency model of size structure was calculated to estimate the probability of <b>cork</b> <b>oak</b> <b>stand</b> survival in a medium and long term time period.

40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} in order to characterise the ectomycorrhizal community of a <b>cork</b> <b>oak</b> <b>stand</b> in Sardinia, composed by plants of Quercus suber, some plants of Q. ilex and shrubby species, mainly Arbutus unedo, Cistus spp. and Erica spp. In the cork oak 20 areal transepts were done in order to map the vegetal species forming ectomycorrhizae, including also those of the genus Erica. A soil sample was taken from the centre of each transept in order to analyse the ectomycorrhizal fungal community. In total 4700 colonized root tips were examined and ascribed to 75 different morphotypes on the basis of morpho-anatomic and biomolecular analyses. 69 of these morphotypes were identified at family, genus or species level by sequencing of the ITS region. Data obtained in this study allowed us to describe the structure of the ectomycorrhizal community and to estimate the efficiency of the sampling method, the correlation between the biodiversity of the two symbiont communities and the richness in species. The fungal community is dominated by Cenococcum geophilum; other widespread species are Lactarius chrysorrheus and one species of Thelephoraceae, whereas several other species are present occasionally. The most representative genera were Lactarius, Russula, Sebacina and Tomentella.

40|$|The {{influence}} of soil type, slope and drainage on tree growth patterns (density, tree size, crown canopy cover and cork yield) was assessed in a cork oak montado, located in Central-western Portugal, {{based on a}} GIS approach followed by field survey. Five soil groups, that is, Arenosols, Regosols, Podzols, Luvisols and Gleysols, combined in three slope classes (flat, undulating and steep) under two different hydromorphic conditions (normal or deficient) were compared based on five <b>cork</b> <b>oak</b> <b>stand</b> parameters using ANOVA and PCA tests. The results showed a clear {{influence of}} soil type on cork oak growth patterns (cork yield, basal area, number of trees per hectare, crown canopy cover and circumference at breast height). In Arenosols all parameters showed maximum values and, in contrast, in Gleysols were found the minimum values. For instance, {{the average of the}} annual cork production for Gleysols (153 kg ha 1 year 1) was only 70 % of the expected annual cork production of Arenosols (219 kg ha 1 year 1) and the average exploited tree density decreased from 56 trees ha 1 in Arenosols to 44 trees ha 1 in Gleysols, for an average exploited tree density of 53 trees ha 1 for the study area. Slope also seems to influence the cork oak growth patterns, as significant statistical differences were found for cork oak growth parameters between slope classes: steep slopes decreased the cork production, the tree size (circumference at breast height) and the tree density. An overall PCA test showed that three main soil groups could be identified: (i) Arenosols and Podzols; (ii) Regosols and (iii) Luvisols and Gleysols, showing that the former, which could allow the tree root development, have a positive influence on the cork oak growth.

In spite of the importance of <b>cork</b> and <b>cork</b> <b>oak</b> <b>stands</b> in Sicilian forests and the potential economic scenarios, few research works have been carried out on these systems. Given the importance of cork thickness in cork quality evaluation, the main objective of this work is to study cork growth in <b>cork</b> <b>oak</b> productive <b>stands</b> spread on the north (Nebrodi Mountains) and south-east (Iblei Mountains) of Sicily. Image analysis techniques were used on cork surfaces of transverse sections of planks to measure cork rings. Dendrochronological analysis was applied to study annual fluctuation on rings growth in relation to various climate parameters in a cork cycle production. Results showed that rainfall, summer drought and temperature are determining factors in controlling cork growth. In siliceous areas of Nebrodi Mountains correlation between cork growth index and rainfall indicates that the rain period from May to September strongly influences phellogen activity. Temperature and water stress indices, on the other hand, show a negative correlation with cork growth. In clay and evolved soils of volcanic plateau of Iblei Mountains January precipitation shows a positive correlation with cork growth index. Also absolute minimum temperature in June and absolute maximum temperature in September show a positive correlation when temperature possibly has influence on phellogen activity during growing season...|$|R

Main results: The allometric relationship was analysed and modelled using the log transformed variables. A slightly curvilinear trend was identified. Thus, a straight line and a curve were both fitted for comparison purposes. Goodness-of-fit statistics point out for a good performance when the data is set to the uppermost observed stocking values. A self-thinning line for <b>cork</b> <b>oak</b> was projected from the estimated relationship. Research highlights: The self-thinning model can be used as an ecological approach to develop density guidelines for oak woodlands in a scenario of increasing cork demands. The results indicate that the recommendations being applied in Portugal are far below the maximal potential stocking values for the species. It is therefore of the utmost importance to review the traditional silvicultural guidelines and endorse new ones...|$|R
40|$|Inventory and {{prediction}} of cork harvest {{over time and}} space is important to forest managers who must plan and organize harvest logistics (transport, storage, etc.). Common field inventory methods including the stem density, diameter and height structure are costly and generally point (plot) based. Furthermore, the irregular horizontal structure of <b>cork</b> <b>oak</b> <b>stands</b> makes it difficult, if not impossible, to interpolate between points. We propose a new method to estimate cork production using digital multispectral aerial imagery. We study the spectral response of individual trees in visible and near infrared spectra and then correlate that response with cork production prior to harvest. We use ground measurements of individual trees production to evaluate the model’s predictive capacity. We propose 14 candidate variables to predict cork production based on crown size in combination with different NDVI index derivates. We use Akaike Information Criteria to choose the best among them. The best model is composed of combinations of different NDVI derivates that include red, green, and blue channels. The proposed model is 15 % more accurate than a model that includes only a crown projection without any spectral information...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of cork {{quality and the}} estimation of cork value {{are very important to}} forest landowners, for management purposes and for cork commercialisation. The Forest Producers Associations have been using a sampling scheme with the objective of estimating cork value (price per unit of weight, usually kg) before extraction, based on the sampling of individual trees along a zigzag transect that covers the entire stand. The sampling error is usually too high, but, from a practical standpoint, it is difficult to increase the sampling intensity if it would imply an increase in sampling costs. The aim of this work was to propose, from data collected in six stands representative of the <b>cork</b> <b>oak</b> <b>stands</b> in Portugal, an alternative sampling methodology with a more efficient precision/ cost ratio. Precision and costs of alternative sampling designs based on clusters of different sizes, complemented with analysis of the intracluster correlation coefficient, were studied in order to propose the most adequate sampling strategy. Single-stage cluster sampling with clusters of 5 – 7 trees guarantees a reasonable sampling error (10 – 15 %) and can be conducted without a large increase in cos...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCork oak (Quercus suber) {{is known}} as one of the most {{fire-resistant}} and fire-resilient tree species in French Mediterranean ecosystems. However, the repetition of high intensity wildfires is hypothesized to entail direct or delayed mortality in the populations of the Maures massif (southern France). We have installed a network of 90 permanent plots in an area affected by the intense 2003 wildfire. The plots were sampled along a gradient of fire recurrence since 1959, with one to four fires, and unburned control plots. Trees were individually surveyed between 2004 and 2007. Field survey included tree mortality, damage intensity, and individual tree growth and allometry. Results indicate that the total tree mortality (i. e. root and stem mortality) ranged from 3 % to 8 % one year after the fire. This confirms the high survival ability of Quercus suber, especially in comparison to the other tree species of the study area. However, delayed mortality has been observed from 2004 to 2007, probably in relation to repetitive summer droughts. The mortality of <b>cork</b> <b>oak</b> did not vary linearly with fire recurrence: it was maximal after one first fire and 3 - 4 fires. The best-fit logistic model predicted the mortality of <b>cork</b> <b>oaks</b> as a function of their dendrometric characteristics (crown and stem diameter), which are hypothesized to express the ability of trees to escape fire and to resprout. At population scale the fires have exerted a size-dependent selection with higher mortality for small and large trees. As a consequence, the fire recurrence tends to regularize and to open the <b>cork</b> <b>oak</b> <b>stands.</b> Our findings suggest that the mortality rate should increase and become a major concern for forest and land managers of this area in a context of global change, with presumably increasing fire recurrence and summer drought...|$|R
40|$|A {{generalized}} non-linear {{tree crown}} diameter model was developed {{with the aim}} of allowing the computation of tree crown diameter over a large range of tree dimensions, and allowing its inclusion in forest growth and yield models. The model was formulated to provide biological meaning to the predicted values. Due to the nested structure of the data analyzed (trees within stands), both mixed- and fixed-effect models were developed. Since tree crown diameter is not frequently measured in forest inventories, the validation of the mixed model was carried out by considering the population specific response. The results demonstrate that when the measurements required for the mixed model calibration are not available, the use of the fixed effect model results in less biased and more accurate estimates. The fixed model was applied to the data from the two last Portuguese National Forest Inventories (NFI) to analyze the change in stand crown cover and assess the stocking evolution of <b>cork</b> <b>oak</b> <b>stands</b> in Portugal between 1996 and 2006. Results showed an increase in the frequency of stands with crown cover lower than 20 %, as well as a decrease in the frequency of stands with crown cover between 20 and 40 %. Average crown cover values were significantly different in the two NFI, with a decrease from 28. 0 to 26. 5 % over the considered periodinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Wildfires are an {{increasingly}} common disturbance influencing wood recruitment to streams, and thereby affecting their physical and biological condition. Mediterranean {{countries such as}} Portugal, where more than 25 % of the land area has burned since 1990, are ideal areas to study impacts of wildfire effects on streams. We evaluated the physical structure of 2206 downed wood pieces (DWP) across 27 first- to third-order streams in central Portugal, all of which had experienced recent wildfires. The streams flowed through monospecific upland forests of Eucalyptus, Maritime pines, or <b>Cork</b> <b>oaks</b> and were fringed by a mixture of riparian tree species. DWP structure differed between tree types and between burned and unburned pieces. Post-fire timber-production forests (Maritime pines and Eucalyptus) contributed a higher quantity of thinner, longer and straighter DWP to streams than <b>Cork</b> <b>oak</b> <b>stands.</b> Pieces from Maritime pines had more rootwads and branches than DWP from the other tree types. Pieces from <b>Cork</b> <b>oak</b> and riparian species generally had a bent form, were shorter and had no rootwads. Burned DWP in streams were often from riparian trees. Relative to unburned DWP, the burned DWP occurred more frequently, were larger and straighter, had branches less often, and were more decayed. With more complex branches, rootwads, and a larger diameter, inputs from burned Maritime pine forests {{are more likely to}} change stream hydraulics and habitat complexity, relative to inputs from Eucalyptus forests with their simpler structure. This study shows that, less than a decade after wildfires, structure of downed wood in and near streams is strongly influenced by wildfire, but also still reflects intrinsic species characteristics and respective silviculture practices, even after the effects of fire have been accounted for. Under an anticipated shift in landscape cover with higher shrubland proportions and more mixing of Maritime pine and Eucalyptus forests, our results suggest that instream large wood will become scarcer and more structurally homogeneous...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{significant}} {{forestry activities}} {{have taken place}} in Sardinia thanks to EU Regulation 2080 / 92 funds. Some 80 % of the afforestated surface has been planted with holm <b>oak</b> and <b>cork</b> <b>oak.</b> The latter also characterizes 89 % of the reforestation area. Given the funding source, plantations have been established on farmlands. Growth performances of these recent <b>cork</b> <b>oak</b> <b>stands</b> have been quantitatively evaluated and compared with the performances of two experimental plots. In Gallura (north-east of Sardinia), that is the traditional cork production area and still is economically the most important cork district of the island, these new <b>cork</b> <b>oak</b> plantations have an average size of 28 ha. They have been established on lands that, before plantation, were either pastures (30 %) or arable lands (70 %). Plantation failures are limited to 8. 8 % of the total (in term of mass) and seem independent of environmental factors or plantations species composition (conifers have been frequently used as secondary species). Average growth of the stem, measured above cork at collar height, is in the range 4 to 8 mm/year with a mean value of 5. 5 mm/year. No correlation appears with either environmental conditions or species composition of the plantations. In the first experimental plot, soil management practices (natural vegetation removal vs its cutting and mulching) does not differentiate young plants growth trends. In the control subplots (no removal) stem collar diameter is 20 % smaller. Localized manual hoeing around trunk base increased the diameters by 13 % but reduced cork thickness by 21 %. The second experimental plot allows comparisons among 27 Mediterranean proveniences of <b>cork</b> <b>oak.</b> The trial exhibits reduced genetic influence: diameters and heights growth are significantly different only among extreme groups. In conclusion, reduced growth performances of the plantations established in farmlands is due, to some extent, to the limitations inherent with private land management (constrained to costs minimization) and, on the other hand, to the generally very limited thickness of Gallura soils. Demand for good quality commercial cork is steadily raising. To sustain the request, in the short term, it would be necessary to extend financial support for plantations care, from 5 to 10 years, or even up to the first stripping (virgin cork) ...|$|R
40|$|Mestrado Mediterranean Forestry and Natural Resources Management (MEDfOR) - Instituto Superior de Agronomia - ULCork oak (Quercus suber L.) {{represents}} {{a crucial role}} on montado ecosystem. This work will contribute {{for the improvement of}} the SUBER model, a growth and yield model developed for <b>cork</b> <b>oak</b> <b>stands</b> in Portugal. In order for the SUBER model to allow the simulation of new stands, it requires the simulation of the model tree state variables. During the first years of tree growth the state variable used by the model is the tree total height. The purpose of this thesis is the modelling of the total heights distributions of young <b>cork</b> <b>oaks</b> plantations. For that, it uses tree measurements taken in 42 plots distributed throughout Portugal with ages between 6 and 22 years old. Following partial objectives were fulfilled: 1) selecting the best probability density function (pdf) to simulate total height distribution; 2) modelling the parameters recovery of the pdf selected, using stand and edaphoclimatic variables as input; 3) validation of the proposed framework, to estimate the total height distributions using the Kolmogorov Smirnov statistic. The results show: 1) the Johnson’s distribution was the best pdf; 2) the mean height, the standard deviation, the skewness and kurtosis were the moments and function of moments used in the parameter recovery; 3) the use of stand and edaphoclimatic variables in the proposed models allows to predict total mean height, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis with model efficiency values of 0. 91, 0. 61, 0. 35 and 0. 21, respectively; 4) 66 % of the simulated height distributions followed the real distribution according to the Kolmogorov – Smirnov test. The general behavior of the simulated Johnson’s distribution is acceptable to predict the total height distributions of new stands in SUBER model. N/...|$|R
