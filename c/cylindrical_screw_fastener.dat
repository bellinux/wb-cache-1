40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} usage of thin and {{high strength steel}} roof battens in the roof structures of low-rise buildings, recent cyclones and storms have shown that they prematurely fail at their <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> connections to the rafters or trusses due to the screw heads pulling through the batten bottom flanges. Such pull-through failures can lead to catastrophic failures of the entire roofing systems as observed during recent high wind events. Therefore a detailed experimental study consisting of both small scale and full scale tests was undertaken to investigate the pull-through failures of roof battens under wind uplift loading in relation to many critical parameters such as <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> tightening, roof batten geometry, batten thickness, steel grade, <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> head size and <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> location. Effects of underside surface and edge details of the <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> head, and <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> types were also considered.

40|$|When steel {{roof and}} wall {{cladding}} systems {{are subjected to}} wind uplift/suction forces, local pull-through/dimpling failures or pull-out failures occur prematurely at their screwed connections. During extreme wind events such as storms and hurricanes, these localized failures then lead to severe damage to buildings and their contents. An investigation was therefore carried out to study the failure that occurs when the <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> pulls out of the steel battens, purlins, or girts. Both two-span cladding tests and small-scale tests were conducted using a range of commonly used <b>screw</b> <b>fasteners</b> and steel battens, purlins, and girts.

40|$|In recent times, the roofing systems made of {{thin and}} high {{strength}} steel roof sheeting and battens or purlins are predominantly used {{in the construction of}} low-rise buildings. However, such thin steel roofing systems continue to fail frequently at their <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> connections during high wind events such as storms and cyclones due to inadequate connection capacities. Localised pull-out failures occurring at the thin steel roof sheeting to batten or purlin connections have been the root cause for extensive loss of roofing systems under high wind uplift loads over many years. Such premature connection failures often cause partial or even complete loss of steel roofing systems and, thus allowing rainwater to cause severe damage to building contents. Therefore a detailed experimental study was conducted to investigate the pull-out failures occurring at the steel roof sheeting to batten or purlin connections. One hundred and eighty-seven small scale pull-out tests were conducted for this purpose using a range of <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> sizes and many thicknesses of thin steel roof battens and purlins. This paper presents the details of this experimental study and the pull-out capacity data obtained from the tests. It then presents suitable design equations and capacity reduction factors to accurately determine the pull-out capacities of <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> connections commonly used in steel roofing systems. In the development of design equations, 592 pull-out capacity data obtained from another experimental study at the Queensland University of Technology were also used.

40|$|Thin {{profiled}} steel {{roof sheeting}} and battens are increasingly {{used in the}} construction of roofing systems of residential, commercial, industrial and farm buildings in Australia. The critical load combination of external wind suction and internal wind pressures that occur during high wind events such as thunderstorms and tropical cylcones often dislocate the roofing systems partially or even completely due to premature roof connection failures. Past wind damage investigations have shown that roof sheeting failures occured at their screw connections to battens. In most of these cases, the <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> head pulled through the thin roof sheeting whilst the <b>screw</b> <b>fasteners</b> also pulled out from the battens. Research studis undertaken on the roof sheeting to batten connection failures have improved this situation. However, the batten to rafter or truss connections have not been investigated adequately. Failure of these connections can cause the failure of the entire roof structure as observed during the recent high wind events. Therefore a detailed experimental study consisting of both small scale and full scale tests has been undertaken to investigate the steel roof batten pull-through failures in relation to many critical parameters such as steel batten geometry, thickness and grade, <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> head sizes and screw tightening.

40|$|High wind uplift loads {{acting on}} the light gauge steel roofing systems during {{tropical}} cyclones and storms frequently cause premature failures of roof connections, which lead to extensive damage to roofing systems. Such roofing system damage was observed in recent cyclones due to premature failures of steel roof batten to rafter/truss connections. They were mostly observed {{to be due to}} a localised pull-through failure in the bottom flanges of roof battens. Hence a series of small scale and full scale tests of roof battens was first conducted to study their pull-through failures. To further enhance the understanding gained from the experimental study and to predict the pull-through capacities {{of a wide range of}} roof battens, finite element models were developed and analysed using a suitable failure criterion.

40|$|Abstract Background Pedicle screws with PMMA cement {{augmentation}} {{have been}} shown to significantly improve the fixation strength in a severely osteoporotic spine. However, the efficacy of screw fixation for different cement augmentation techniques, namely solid screws with retrograde cement pre-filling versus cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation, remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the difference in pullout strength between conical and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screws</b> based on the aforementioned cement augmentation techniques. The potential loss of fixation upon partial screw removal after screw insertion was also examined. Method The Taguchi method with an L 8 array was employed to determine the significance of design factors. Conical and <b>cylindrical</b> pedicle <b>screws</b> with solid or cannulated designs were installed using two different screw augmentation techniques: solid screws with retrograde cement pre-filling and cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation. Uniform synthetic bones (test block) simulating severe osteoporosis were used to provide a platform for each screw design and cement augmentation technique. Pedicle screws at full insertion and after a 360 -degree back-out from full insertion were then tested for axial pullout failure using a mechanical testing machine. Results The results revealed the following 1) Regardless of the screw outer geometry (conical or <b>cylindrical),</b> solid <b>screws</b> with retrograde cement pre-filling exhibited significantly higher pullout strength than did cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation (p = 0. 0129 for conical screws; p = 0. 005 for <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screws).</b> 2) For a given cement augmentation technique (screws without cement augmentation, cannulated screws with cement injection or solid screws with cement pre-filling), no significant difference in pullout strength was found between conical and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screws</b> (p > 0. 05). 3) Cement infiltration into the open cell of the test block {{led to the formation of}} a cement/bone composite structure. Observations of the failed specimens indicated that failure occurred at the composite/bone interface, whereas the composite remained well bonded to the screws. This result implies that the screw/composite interfacial strength was much higher than the composite/bone interfacial strength. 4) The back-out of the screw by 360 degrees from full insertion did not decrease the pullout strength in any of the studied cases. 5) Generally, larger standard deviations were found for the screw back-out cases, implying that the results of full insertion cases are more repeatable than those of the back-out cases. Conclusions Solid screws with retrograde cement pre-filling offer improved initial fixation strength when compared to that of cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation for both the conically and cylindrically shaped screw. Our results also suggest that the fixation screws can be backed out by 360 degrees for intra-operative adjustment without the loss of fixation strength. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This {{study was}} {{designed}} to derive the theoretical formulae to predict the pullout strength of pedicle screws with an inconstant outer and/or inner diameter distribution (conical screws). For the transpedicular fixation, one of the failure modes is the screw loosening from the vertebral bone. Hence, various kinds of pedicle screws have been evaluated to measure the pullout strength using synthetic and cadaveric bone as specimens. In the literature, the Chapman's formula has been widely proposed to predict the pullout strength of screws with constant outer and inner diameters (<b>cylindrical</b> <b>screws).</b> Methods This study formulated the pullout strength of the conical and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>screws</b> as the functions of material, screw, and surgery factors. The predicted pullout strength of each screw was compared to the experimentally measured data. Synthetic bones were used to standardize the material properties of the specimen and provide observation of the loosening mechanism of the bone/screw construct. Results The predicted data from the new formulae were better correlated with the mean pullout strength of both the <b>cylindrical</b> and conical <b>screws</b> within an average error of 5. 0 % and R 2 = 0. 93. On the other hand, the average error and R 2 value of the literature formula were as high as - 32. 3 % and - 0. 26, respectively. Conclusion The pullout strength of the pedicle screws was the functions of bone strength, screw design, and pilot hole. The close correlation between the measured and predicted pullout strength validated the value of the new formulae, so as avoid repeating experimental tests. </p...|$|R
