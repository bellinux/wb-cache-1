5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E
25|$|Several obituaries {{describe}} Liberati's professional experience, {{highlighting the}} main features of his work and the ideas he supported. He believed that within a health system, research should {{be an integral part}} of its mission, especially where lack of commercial interests prevents the possibility of private investment, and that researchers should <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> is relevant to patients, not to their careers or to drug companies. Moreover, he strongly believed that developing alliances with consumers is necessary for setting research priorities, and that research results should be easily accessible to people who need to make decisions about their own health.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> {{is going on in the}} scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess what will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E

25|$|Many {{specific}} {{points by}} Ehrman <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> may {{be regarded as}} the 'embarrassments' and 'failures' of the various depictions of Jesus Christ found in the gospels and the works of Paul which point to an account based on a real person that got embellished rather than a completely made up figure. He notes that Jews in the first century AD expected their Messiah to come from Bethlehem while Jesus is described as growing up in Nazareth, a dilemma that is simply not addressed in the Gospel of Mark (which has no nativity account) even though it is regarded as the earliest gospel. The betrayal of Jesus by Judas is another example, as critics of early Christianity found it strange that the Messiah would display the lack of personal awareness and foresight even to keep his close followers in line. Ehrman states that such things would make sense for a historical Jesus whom multiple people believed grew up, lived, and died in a certain time and place versus a purely mythological figure with malleable personal details.|$|E
500|$|Hetreed {{worked closely}} with Tucker and Webber to adapt the book, {{explaining}} that [...] "... working with them on drafts helped me to <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> the film would be, rather than how beautifully I could make a line work." [...] Her first draft was closest to the source material and it slowly [...] "... developed its own character ..." [...] through rewrites. She avoided using a voiceover, which was present in the novel, [...] "... partly because {{it would make it}} very literary." [...] Instead, she focused on conveying Griet's thoughts visually– for example, in her adaptation Griet and Vermeer inspect the camera obscura together under his cloak amidst sexual tension; whereas, in the novel Griet views it alone immediately after him and enjoys the lasting warmth and scent he leaves.|$|E
500|$|The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios {{to record}} a demo tape and {{subsequently}} secured a record deal with EMI. Flea left Fear to pursue the Red Hot Chili Peppers. At the same time, What is This? had also gotten a record deal. Since Slovak considered the Chili Peppers to merely be a side project and not a serious commitment, he left them to <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> <b>What</b> is This? Flea ultimately respected the decision, but felt the band would suffer musically without them. He and Kiedis hired drummer Cliff Martinez and guitarist Jack Sherman to fill Irons' and Slovak's places, respectively. [...] During the recording of the second What is This? album, Slovak became frustrated with the band and contacted Flea about rejoining the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This came at an opportune time, as the group was dissatisfied with Slovak's replacement, Jack Sherman. Kiedis felt that Sherman's guitar work [...] "didn't have the same spirit" [...] that Slovak contributed to the band's sound. [...] When Flea asked Kiedis {{how he felt about}} Slovak rejoining the band, Kiedis responded by saying [...] "I'd give my firstborn son to get him back in the band." [...] After the culmination of the promotional tour for their first album, Sherman was fired and Slovak rejoined the band.|$|E

500|$|O'Mahoney and Winter {{began working}} on the film in 2006. Winter had watched a film called The Women's Story, about two Iraqi women who had journeyed {{around the country and}} filmed what they saw. They wanted to make a {{documentary}} about [...] "the people never seen on the evening news, [...] presidents, prime ministers, generals and militants ... claiming to know something of Iraq's future". Winter explained that [...] "all these documentaries coming out of Iraq were done for or by adults. Iraqi children had not been more than a UN statistic about the dead, kidnapped or injured", so they decided to <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> they viewed as the [...] "real source of Iraq's future" [...] – teenagers. [...] "I wanted {{to tell the story of}} Iraq in a different way. As journalists, we do stories about kids and teenagers, but we don't hear from them. If you go to the UN reports, they are just a number and that's it." [...] O'Mahoney was a little more reticent; he had recently worked in Iraq but did not wish to return due to the civil war and the deteriorating condition of the country. When it was decided to use a school as a backdrop to the story, which could also be used to provide a chronological narrative, O'Mahoney and Winter realised it would be too dangerous for the students to be seen with either a Western or Iraqi camera crew because it would draw too much attention to them, and so they decided that the students would film the documentary themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Merezhkovsky and Gippius made a pact, each {{promising}} to <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> {{he or she}} did best, the former on poetry, the latter on prose. The agreement collapsed as Zinaida translated Lord Byron's Manfred, and Dimitry started working on his debut novel Julian the Apostate. In Saint Petersburg Gippius joined the Russian Literary Society, {{became a member of}} the Shakespearean Circle (the celebrity lawyer Prince Alexander Urusov being its most famous member), and met and befriended [...] Yakov Polonsky, Apollon Maykov, Dmitry Grigorovich, Aleksey Pleshcheyev and Pyotr Veinberg. She became close to the group of authors associated with the renovated Severny Vestnik, where she herself made her major debut as a poet in 1888.|$|E
2500|$|According to Archbishop John Habgood, both {{science and}} {{religion}} represent distinct ways of approaching experience and these differences are sources of debate. He views science as descriptive and religion as prescriptive. He stated that if science and mathematics <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> the world ought to be, {{in the way that}} religion does, it may lead to improperly ascribing properties to the natural world as happened among the followers of Pythagoras in the sixth century B.C. In contrast, proponents of a normative moral science take issue with the idea that science has no way of guiding [...] "oughts". Habgood also stated that he believed that the reverse situation, where religion attempts to be descriptive, can also lead to inappropriately assigning properties to the natural world. A notable example is the now defunct belief in the Ptolemaic (geocentric) planetary model that held sway until changes in scientific and religious thinking were brought about by Galileo and proponents of his views.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, {{some weeks}} after her {{unsuccessful}} audition for Geena Gregory, Jones was contacted by Coronation Street bosses, who {{offered her a}} part of a new character. Jones took on the role of Karen Phillips (no relation to Mandy), making her first appearance on 21 June. The character, after marrying Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), took on his surname, and became Karen McDonald. Described as [...] "a bulldog in hoop earrings" [...] and a [...] "Victoria Beckham wannabe", the role garnered Jones public attention, with episodes involving feuds between her and rival Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) receiving millions of viewers; the episode featuring Karen and Steve's (second) wedding, ruined by Tracy Barlow's revelation that her daughter Amy Barlow was Steve's love child, received 16.3 million viewers. Jones also began modelling for men's magazines such as FHM and Loaded, saying: [...] "I was 21, and within three weeks of me joining Corrie I was in Barbados doing a bikini shoot [...] I was quite impressionable and I'd just say yes to everything because I wanted to keep my job. The press officer is saying: 'Do this and you'll be the new young funky sexy girl.' We were all doing it at that time, but I realised quite quickly that I needed to <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> I was doing".|$|E
2500|$|Soon thereafter, Flea {{formed a}} [...] "one-off" [...] band with Kiedis, Slovak and Irons in 1983. The band, which was dubbed [...] "Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem" [...] {{for its first}} gig, was a hit with the club audience. The band's name changed to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the band quickly gained {{popularity}} around Los Angeles. Over {{the course of the}} next six months, the Red Hot Chili Peppers played many shows in Los Angeles clubs and became something of an underground hit. The band scored a record deal with EMI after just that short period of time and was set to record its first album. Unfortunately, What Is This? had also signed a record deal two weeks earlier. Since Slovak and Irons considered the Red Hot Chili Peppers to merely be a side project and not a serious commitment, they left the band to <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> <b>What</b> Is This?. With What Is This?, Irons recorded two EPs (Squeezed (1984), 3 Out of 5 Live (1985)) and one full-length album (What Is This? (1985)). The band broke up following the recording of the self-titled What Is This? album as Slovak became frustrated with the band and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers. In the meantime, Irons played on several tracks on an album by the duo Walk the Moon, made up of Johannes and Natasha Shneider. After hearing that drummer Cliff Martinez had resigned, Irons, who was out of work and finally separated from other commitments, returned to the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1986.|$|E
