40|$|The {{empirical}} {{performance of}} <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> <b>writing</b> is quite puzzling {{in the traditional}} finance framework. <b>Covered</b> <b>call</b> <b>writing</b> is typically a risk reducing strategy so its expected return should be less than the expected return on the underlying in an efficient market. However, recent empirical evidence suggests (covering a period from 1988 onwards) that the <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> <b>writing</b> has nearly the same return as the underlying whereas the standard deviation of returns is considerably less. Market professionals consider a call option to be a surrogate for the underlying. Such mental accounting of a call option with the underlying has strong support in laboratory experiments. We show that such mental accounting embodied in the principle, assets with similar payoffs must have the same expected returns, provides a new behavioral explanation for the puzzling empirical performance of <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> <b>writing.</b> JEL: G 13, G 1...|$|R

40|$|Various {{explanations}} for the popularity of <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> option strategies have been explored in the literature. According to Shefrin and Statman [1993], framing and risk aversion can help justify its attractiveness to investors. Applying prospect theory and hedonic framing, these authors predict that {{in a world of}} frame dependence an investor that is sufficiently risk averse in the domain of gains will prefer a <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> position over a stock only position and that certain <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> designs will be preferred despite identical cash flows. To date, the relationship among framing, risk aversion, and <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> <b>writing</b> has not been empirically tested. We gather empirical evidence to complete this gap in the literature. We find highly significant empirical evidence for a pronounced framing effect with respect to different <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> designs with equal net cash flows as well as <b>covered</b> <b>calls</b> in general. We find only scarce empirical evidence for a relationship between risk aversion in the domain of gains and a preference for <b>covered</b> <b>calls.</b> In order to observe a positive relationship between risk aversion and <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> <b>writing,</b> investors with above average risk aversion seem to be required.

40|$|The <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> <b>writing,</b> which entails {{selling a}} call option on one’s {{underlying}} stock holdings, is perceived by investors {{as a strategy}} with limited risk. It is a very popular strategy used by individual, professional and institutional investors. Previous studies analyze behavioral aspects of the <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategy, indicating that hedonic framing and risk aversion may explain the preference of such a strategy with respect to other designs. In this contribution, following this line of research, we extend the analysis and apply Cumulative Prospect Theory in its continuous version to {{the evaluation of the}} <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategy and study the effects of alternative framing...|$|R
40|$|An analogy based {{call option}} pricing model is put forward. The model {{provides}} a new {{explanation for the}} implied volatility skew puzzle and is consistent with empirical findings regarding leverage adjusted index option returns. It also explains puzzling superior performance of <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> <b>writing</b> and worse-than-expected performance of zero-beta straddles. The analogy based stochastic volatility and the analogy jump diffusion models are also developed. The analogy based stochastic volatility model generates the skew even without any correlation between the stock price and volatility processes, whereas, the analogy jump diffusion does not require asymmetric jumps to generate the skew.

40|$|There {{are various}} types of risk {{associated}} with trading options. Traders typically manage such risks {{with the help of}} various partial derivatives of option prices known as Greeks. Experimental and anecdotal evidence suggests that mental accounting matters in the valuation of options. Mental accounting changes the values of Greeks significantly with crucial implications for risk management. I show that for a call option, delta-risk is under-estimated, gamma risk is over-estimated, and the value-decay due to the passage of time is under-estimated. For a put option, all three types of risks are over-estimated. I also show that <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> <b>writing</b> is more profitable when mental accounting influences prices...|$|R
40|$|<b>Writing</b> <b>call</b> options against long {{positions}} in the underlying equities {{is the most popular}} options strategy. Since the variance is an inadequate measure of risk for options strategies, this paper uses a range of dominance criteria and four utility functions to compare the performance of partly and fully <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategies with that of the underlying equity portfolio. It is found that the dominance criteria are ineffective in choosing between strategies. However, all four utility functions (representing different combinations of absolute and relative risk aversion) find that the <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategy is preferable for the data period studied, supporting the widespread use of this strategy. <b>Call</b> Options, <b>Covered</b> <b>Calls,</b> Buy-writes, Overwrites,...|$|R
40|$|A <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> {{is a long}} {{position}} in a security and a short position in a call option on that security. Equity index <b>covered</b> <b>calls</b> are an attractive strategy to many investors because they have realized returns not much {{lower than those of}} the equity market but with much lower volatility. However, a number of myths about the strategy—from why it works to why an investor should or should not invest—have surfaced, {{and many of them are}} erroneously considered “common knowledge. ” The authors review the underlying risk and returns of <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategies and dispel eight common myths about them. A <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> is a combination of a long posi-tion in a security and a short position in a call option on the same security. The combined position caps the investor’s upside on the underlying security at the option’s strike price in exchange for an option premium. Figure 1 shows the <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> payoff diagram, including the option premium, at expiration when the <b>call</b> option is <b>written</b> at a $ 100 strike with a $ 25 option premium. The <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategy has generated atten-tion because of its attractive historical risk-adjuste...|$|R
50|$|Margin {{requirements}} are reduced for positions that offset each other. For instance spread traders who have offsetting futures contracts {{do not have}} to deposit collateral both for their short position and their long position. The exchange calculates the loss in a worst-case scenario of the total position. Similarly an investor who creates a collar has reduced risk since any loss on the call is offset by a gain in the stock, and a large loss in the stock is offset by a gain on the put; in general, <b>covered</b> <b>calls</b> have less strict requirements than naked <b>call</b> <b>writing.</b>|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} {{benefit of}} an ETF is the stock-like features offered. A mutual fund is bought or {{sold at the}} end of a day's trading, whereas ETFs can be traded whenever the market is open. Since ETFs trade on the market, investors can carry out the same types of trades that they can with a stock. For instance, investors can sell short, use a limit order, use a stop-loss order, buy on margin, and invest as much or as little money as they wish (there is no minimum investment requirement). Also, many ETFs have the capability for options (puts and <b>calls)</b> to be <b>written</b> against them. <b>Covered</b> <b>call</b> strategies allow investors and traders to potentially increase their returns on their ETF purchases by collecting premiums (the proceeds of a <b>call</b> sale or <b>write)</b> on <b>calls</b> <b>written</b> against them. Mutual funds do not offer those features.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> {{position}} is a neutral-to-bullish investment strategy {{and consists of}} purchasing a stock and selling a call option against the stock. Two useful return calculations for <b>covered</b> <b>calls</b> are the %If Unchanged Return and the %If Assigned Return. The %If Unchanged Return calculation determines the potential return assuming a <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> position's stock price at option expiration {{is the same as}} at initial purchase. The %If Assigned Return calculation assumes the price of the stock is equal to or greater than the strike price of the sold call option. For in-the-money (see moneyness) <b>covered</b> <b>calls,</b> the calculations for %If Unchanged Return and the %If Assigned Return will be equal. Example calculations for %If Unchanged potential return and %If Assigned Return for <b>covered</b> <b>calls</b> are shown below: ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} QQQ <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategies from January 2002 through January 2012 and finds that downside risk-adjusted returns are attractive both on an absolute basis and relative {{to those of}} long QQQ positions. The study then presents a framework that partitions <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> positions into delta-neutral short call and long equity positions, which highlights the separability of decisions about delta-neutral short option and long equity exposure within a broader class of short call strategies that includes <b>covered</b> <b>calls.</b> The study then demonstrates that selling QQQ call options and buying QQQ shares on a delta-neutral basis, both without and with delta rebalancing, offers attractive risk–reward tradeoffs. The study then constructs out-of-sample implied volatility fitted values and examines the performance of <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> and delta-neutral short call strategies when estimates indicate that implied volatility is more overpriced than usual. These conditions substantially enhance the performance of <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategies as well as short delta-neutral call strategies. 1 Recent studies that have examined the profitability of <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategies hav...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} performance of the fully <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategy both theoretically and empirically. In the first essay, using standard Black-Scholes assumptions, we show that the expected return and standard deviation of the <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategy are smaller than those of the underlying equity, either in instantaneous case or over a finite time horizon. Next, we show theoretically that the <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> for a set of out of the money strike prices could outperform a buy and hold strategy if Sharpe ratio is used as the measure to rank and choose portfolios. This seemingly contradictory result to the finance theory comes from the inappropriate use of Sharpe ratio when the return is non-normally distributed. The <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategy does not dominate the buy and hold strategy any more when using alternative performance measure that accounts for the downside risk. A Monte Carlo study confirms these results. ^ In the second essay, a few empirical tests are conducted. The first study uses simulated call prices and the results show that the out-of-the-money <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategy outperforms the buy and hold strategy in various market conditions between 1969 and 1999. This surprising result is further confirmed by another empirical analysis that uses actual option price data from 1998 to 2002. The implication is that the call option contracts might be overpriced in the market. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} Stochastic Dominance (SD) of {{investment}} strategies which combine a long {{position in a}} stock index with a short position in options written on that index. Two main issues are analysed here: First, exercise prices are analysed which are conditioned on proxies of expected returns. Second, next to the well-known <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategies, the SD of uncovered put strategies is also investigated. Empirical analysis of strategies on the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index shows that <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategies dominate an index investment at {{the second and third}} degrees, while uncovered put strategies fail to do so.
