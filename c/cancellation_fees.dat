25|$|Following {{a change}} of {{government}} in October 1993, the incoming Liberal Party ordered the immediate cancellation of the order, forcing the payment of C$500 million of <b>cancellation</b> <b>fees.</b> By not purchasing the helicopters and slashing the DND budget, the government aimed to trim the deficit and be more fiscally responsible. As a negative, the Liberal government left itself with little maneuvering room as the Sea King fleet continued to age and its systems become obsolete; a replacement was needed but no alternative or contingency plan had been made. Some commentators observed that cancelling the NSA contract was not a fiscally responsible move. During one debate, Chrétien famously retorted that the President of the United States still flew in a Sea King, thus the helicopter was also good enough for Canada.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a single-sink {{transportation}} problem {{in which the}} production capacity of the suppliers and the demand of the single customer are stochastic. Shipments are performed by capacitated vehicles, which have to be booked in advance, before {{the realization of the}} production capacity and the demand. Once the production capacity and the demand are revealed, there is an option to cancel some of the booked vehicles against a <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee.</b> If the quantity shipped from the suppliers using the booked vehicles is not enough to satisfy the demand, the residual quantity is purchased from an external company. The problem is to determine the number of vehicles to book in order to minimize the total cost. We formulate a two-stage and a multistage stochastic mixed integer linear programming mod-els to solve this problem and test them on a real case provided by Italcementi, the primary Italian clinker producer and the 5 th largest cement producer in the world. We test the influence of dif-ferent scenario-tree structures on the solutions of the problem, as well as sensitivity of the results with respect to the <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee.</b> Key Words.

Google had a cancellation policy that stated that some providers may have a <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee.</b> In those cases customers were required to call in 24 hours prior to the session to avoid the fee, which was either 50% of the fixed session price or five times the per-minute rate.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{originally}} called DabbleNYC, then renamed to Classtivity.

The flight to America was cancelled, Drouhin was owed a $4,000 <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee,</b> and had the Columbia guarded from leaving as a precaution. The inexperienced pilot Levine took off to England, claiming to the guards he was just testing the engine. Boll followed Levine to England by boat, talking Levine into letting her be a passenger. Just before the flight, Levine's new pilot Capt. Hinchcliffe, publicly refused to let Boll fly along. Boll was invited to try an east-west flight from America, and she set out for New York by boat in January 1928.|$|R
50|$|The {{prosecution}} {{alleged that}} on 29 August 1999 a man living in Croydon telephoned Taeger's agency {{asking for the}} services of a prostitute. The defendant went to the address with a prostitute. But the client had changed his mind and claimed that he had not made a telephone call. The defendant insisted that a £50 <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee</b> be paid, and forced his way into the house, producing a knife and demanding payment. The client went upstairs and opened a safe, whereupon the defendant took some £4000 from it and ran from the house. This incident founded the first count of aggravated burglary in the indictment later preferred against the defendant. But his account of the incident was quite different. He said that he had been given the £50 fee without any threat and had taken nothing from the safe. But he said that after this incident he had reported the existence of the safe and its contents to Taeger in the presence of Sullivan.|$|R

Fitness First sought action to ensure that gym contracts with clients were still legally valid even if the court were to find that the client did not understand what he or she had signed. Fitness First's victory on appeal overturned a prior decision against the company by the NSW Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal, which had found that a contract required a [...] "meeting of the minds, in that they each fully know and understand the terms and conditions of the agreement".

5|$|In 1987, Canada {{selected}} the EH101 to replace their Sea Kings in anti-submarine warfare and {{search and rescue}} roles; the EH101's third engine and increased autonomy compared favorably against rivals such as the Sikorsky Seahawk, its range and de-icing capability were also seen as vital for North Atlantic operations. The fledgling EH101, of which up to 50 were on order to replace the Canadian Armed Forces's (CAF) Sea Kings, found itself subject to a wider political battle between the Conservative and Liberal parties, the latter viewing the aircraft as too costly. Critics attacked the EH101 purchase as excessive and unnecessary after the Cold War's end in the early 1990s. Wide-ranging cost estimates were presented by both proponents and opponents of the EH101 procurement, with opponents backing life extensions of Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King and Boeing Vertol CH-113 Labrador helicopter fleets. The EH101 controversy {{was seen as a}} factor in the 1993 Canadian federal election. The order was cancelled by the new Liberal government in 1993 resulting in a $470 million <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|R
40|$|It is {{now more}} than two years since the new Civil Code (OZ), which unified the {{previous}} predominantly two-way regulation of the discharge of obligations in one single codex, became effective. As a follow-up to this legally significant event, the focus of my PhD thesis (dissertation) has been on analyzing the resulting changes in comparison with the foregoing legal regulation of the Civil Code and the Commercial Code, including a deliberation on whether such changes have been positive or, alternatively, whether the new regulation can be reproached for certain shortcomings. Although the regulation of OZ which deals with the termination of obligations due to unilateral legal act (such as satisfaction/fulfillment of an obligation (in Czech: "splnění"), deposition in court custody (in Czech: "složení do soudní úschovy"), withdrawal from a contract (in Czech: "odstoupení od smlouvy"), contract <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee</b> (in Czech: "odstupné"), cancellation/termination of a contract by a notice of cancellation/termination (in Czech: "výpověď smlouvy"), and unilateral set-off (in Czech: "jednostranné započtení")) mostly follows up the preceding regulation, it also introduces certain new elements.

The deal was finalized, but the opposition Liberal Party of Canada made it an election issue and argued that the helicopters were too expensive. After winning the election, the Liberals canceled the contract and incurred <b>cancellation</b> <b>fees</b> of $500 million (CAD). The Sea Kings have since had numerous crashes and require 30 hours of maintenance for every hour of flight time.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a dynamic equilibrium model of high frequency trading (HFT). The {{model is a}} stochastic sequential game with endogenous trading decisions in a limit order market. There {{are two types of}} agents: fast and slow traders. Fast traders have speed advantages in terms of analysing information and the low‐latency transmission of orders. Nevertheless, slow traders can observe and learn from the signals disclosed by fast traders in the market activity. We find that HFT improves market quality by increasing informational efficiency and liquidity. Fast traders make larger average trading profits than slow traders; however the trading profits of slow traders are higher when there is HFT in the market than in the case where HFT is absent. This is due to both the improvements in market quality induced by HFT and the learning process followed by slow traders, which increases the effectiveness of their trading strategies. We report that a <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee,</b> which has already been imposed by some exchanges, may affect negatively the market quality. Finally, we show that HFT traders may have incentives to manipulate market volatility since they can make larger profits through limit orders when we simulate a volatility shock. 2...|$|R
