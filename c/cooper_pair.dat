5|$|The Sommerfeld {{model and}} spin models for {{ferromagnetism}} illustrated the successful application {{of quantum mechanics}} to condensed matter problems in the 1930s. However, there still were several unsolved problems, most notably the description of superconductivity and the Kondo effect. After World War II, several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems. These included recognition of collective excitation modes of solids and the important notion of a quasiparticle. Russian physicist Lev Landau used {{the idea for the}} Fermi liquid theory wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now termed Landau-quasiparticles. Landau also developed a mean field theory for continuous phase transitions, which described ordered phases as spontaneous breakdown of symmetry. The theory also introduced the notion of an order parameter to distinguish between ordered phases. Eventually in 1965, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and John Schrieffer developed the so-called BCS theory of superconductivity, based on the discovery that arbitrarily small attraction between two electrons of opposite spin mediated by phonons in the lattice can give rise to a bound state called a <b>Cooper</b> <b>pair.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} {{is different in}} a superconductor. In a conventional superconductor, the electronic fluid cannot be resolved into individual electrons. Instead, it consists of bound pairs of electrons known as Cooper pairs. This pairing is caused by an attractive force between electrons from the exchange of phonons. Due to quantum mechanics, the energy spectrum of this <b>Cooper</b> <b>pair</b> fluid possesses an energy gap, meaning there is a minimum amount of energy ΔE that must be supplied in order to excite the fluid. Therefore, if ΔE {{is larger than the}} thermal energy of the lattice, given by kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature, the fluid will not be scattered by the lattice. The <b>Cooper</b> <b>pair</b> fluid is thus a superfluid, meaning it can flow without energy dissipation.|$|E

2500|$|Experimentally, polarons are {{important}} to the understanding {{of a wide variety of}} materials. The electron mobility in semiconductors can be greatly decreased by the formation of polarons. Organic semiconductors are also sensitive to polaronic effects, which is particularly relevant in the design of organic solar cells that effectively transport charge. The electron phonon interaction that forms Cooper pairs in low-Tc superconductors [...] (type-I superconductors) can also be modeled as a polaron, and two opposite spin electrons may form a bipolaron sharing a phonon cloud.

2500|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} helium-3, which distinguishes {{it from the}} more common helium-4, is that its nucleus is a fermion since it contains an odd number of spin [...] particles. Helium-4 nuclei are bosons, containing an even number of spin [...] particles. This {{is a direct result}} of the addition rules for quantized angular momentum. At low temperatures (about 2.17 K), helium-4 undergoes a phase transition: A fraction of it enters a superfluid phase that can be roughly understood as a type of Bose–Einstein condensate. Such a mechanism is not available for helium-3 atoms, which are fermions. However, it was widely speculated that helium-3 could also become a superfluid at much lower temperatures, if the atoms formed into pairs analogous to Cooper pairs in the BCS theory of superconductivity. Each <b>Cooper</b> <b>pair,</b> having integer spin, can be thought of as a boson. During the 1970s, David Lee, Douglas Osheroff and Robert Coleman Richardson discovered two phase transitions along the melting curve, which were soon realized to be the two superfluid phases of helium-3. |journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=28|issue=14|pages=885–888|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.28.885|url= |bibcode= 1972PhRvL..28..885O}} below 3 mK|journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=29|issue=14|pages=920–923|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.29.920|bibcode=1972PhRvL..29..920O}} The transition to a superfluid occurs at 2.491 millikelvins on the melting curve.

40|$|Isoscalar <b>Cooper</b> <b>pairing</b> in isospin {{asymmetric}} nuclear matter occurs {{between states}} populating two distinct Fermi surfaces, each for neutrons and protons. The {{transition from a}} BCS-like to the normal (unpaired) state, as the isospin asymmetry is increased, is intervened by superconducting phases which spontaneously break translational and rotational symmetries. One possibility is {{the formation of a}} condensate with a periodic crystallinelike structure where <b>Cooper</b> <b>pairs</b> carry net momentum (the nuclear Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell-phase). Alternatively, perturbations of the Fermi surfaces away from spherical symmetry allow for minima in the condensate free energy which correspond to a states with quadrupole deformations of Fermi surfaces and zero momentum of the <b>Cooper</b> <b>pairs.</b> In a combined treatment of these phases we show that, although the <b>Cooper</b> <b>pairing</b> with finite momentum might arise as a local minimum, the lowest energy state features are deformed Fermi surfaces and <b>Cooper</b> <b>pairs</b> with vanishing total momentum.
