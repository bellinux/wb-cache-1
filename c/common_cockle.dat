By examining 3416 individuals of 11 potential host species from sympatric host populations, we found that the recently introduced parasite M. orientalis does not only infect its principal host, the invasive Pacific oyster (prevalence at infected sites 2 – 43 %, mean intensity 4. 1 ± 0. 6 SE), but also native blue mussels (Mytilus edulis; 3 – 63 %, 2. 1 ± 0. 2), <b>common</b> <b>cockles</b> (Cerastoderma edule; 2 – 13 %, 1. 2 ± 0. 3) and Baltic tellins (Macoma balthica; 6 – 7 %, 1. 0 ± 0), confirming a spillover effect.

40|$|Populations of the <b>Common</b> European <b>cockle</b> (Cerastoderma edule) {{often have}} highly patchy {{distributions}} and variable recruitment success. One {{of the proposed}} reasons is that high densities of filter feeders and/or bioturbators are thought to reduce the success of larval settlement and post-settlement survival, but the direct causal processes driving these observations are not clearly identified and validated. Through combined field and laboratory experiments, we test the hypothesis that macrofauna cause decreases in post-larval density through feeding and movement activities. The effect of excluding the bioturbating lugworm Arenicola marina and filter-feeding adult cockles on post-larval cockle densities was estimated in separate field experiments at two locations {{from the time of}} initial larval settlement in May 2012 to late summer August 2012. Lugworm exclusion led to a significant increase in cockle post-larval densities whereas the opposite was true for adult cockles, where exclusion led to a reduction in C. edule post-larval density. Although clear effects were observed in the field, experiments conducted in the laboratory failed to detect changes in mortality or byssus drifting of post-larvae as a consequence of macrofaunal activity. This study demonstrates that the presence of macrofauna can have both positive and negative effects on post-settlement density of C. edule post-larvae. Thus the density, distribution and identity of macrofauna have significant effects on the density and spatial distribution of C. edule post-larvae during the post-settlement period. These observations have implications for conservation and fishery management of this species...|$|R

40|$|Symbiotic {{associations}} are complex partnerships {{that can lead}} to new metabolic capabilities and the establishment of novel organisms. The diversity of these associations is very broad and there are still many mysteries about the origin and the exact relationship between the organisms that are involved in a symbiosis (host and symbiont). Some of these {{associations are}} essential to the hosts, such as the chemosynthetic symbioses occurring in invertebrates of the deep-sea. In others the host probably would rather not be the host, {{as in the case of}} parasitic microbes. My PhD research focuses on symbiotic and parasitic associations in chemosynthetic and non-chemosynthetic invertebrates. This thesis describes and discusses three different aspects of associations between bacteria and marine invertebrates. The first aspect focuses on chemosynthetic associations from a unique asphalt seep called Chapopote in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Phylogenetic analyses of host genes (cytochrome-c-oxidase subunit I) and bacterial genes (16 S rRNA) in two Bathymodiolus mussel species and an Escarpia tubeworm showed that both the hosts and their chemosynthetic symbionts are very similar to their congeners from the northern GoM. Unexpectedly, a novel symbiont most closely related to hydrocarbon degrading bacteria of the genus Cycloclasticus was discovered in B. heckerae. Stable carbon isotope values in B. heckerae tissues of lipids typical for Cycloclasticus spp. were consistently heavier by 2. 5 permil than other lipids indicating that the novel symbiont might use isotopically heavy hydrocarbons from the asphalt seep as an energy and carbon source. The discovery of a novel symbiont that may be able to metabolize hydrocarbons is particularly intriguing because until now only methane and reduced sulfur compounds have been identified as energy sources in chemosynthetic symbioses. The large amounts of hydrocarbons available at Chapopote would provide these mussel symbioses with a rich source of nutrition. The second aspect of this thesis deals with bacteria that infect the nuclei of marine invertebrates and were recently found to be widespread in deep-sea Bathymodiolus mussels. Because of their potentially lethal effect on bivalve populations, I looked for the presence of intranuclear bacteria in economically important and commercially available bivalve species, i. e. oysters (Crassostrea gigas), razor clams (Siliqua patula and Ensis directus), blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), Manila clams (Venerupis philippinarum), and <b>common</b> <b>cockles</b> (Cerastoderma edule). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed the presence of intranuclear bacteria in all investigated bivalves except oysters and blue mussels. Preliminary tests with real-time PCR showed massive amounts of intranuclear bacteria in some of the bivalve species, raising the question if these might affect not only the health of the bivalves but possibly also of the humans that eat them. In the third and final aspect of my thesis, I examined the general diversity of bacteria in the gill tissues of deep-sea and shallow-water mussels and clams. Comparative 16 S rRNA sequence analysis and cultivation experiments revealed a much higher diversity than previously recognized. This thesis shows that bivalves are ideal models for studying the microbiota of marine invertebrates because of the high diversity of both highly specific and more generalized symbiotic and parasitic bacteria in their gill tissues...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAmong the {{potential}} biotic factors affecting population dynamics, parasitism has received relatively little attention. The {{purpose of this}} study was to inventory marine bivalve parasites and to investigate relations between different parasite communities. Five intertidal stations along the French Atlantic shore were studied between Brittany and Arcachon Bay. Two bivalves (the edible cockle, Cerastoderma edule, and the Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum) were sampled and examined. The parasites included a bacterium (Vibrio tapetis), a protozoan (Perkinsus sp.), and digenetic trematode metacercariae (10 species). Perkinsus sp. prevalence and density in clams were higher than those measured in cockles (30 250 vs. 36 cells g− 1 of gill wet weight, respectively) while digeneans were more <b>common</b> in <b>cockles</b> (46 metacercariae per cockle host vs. 1 per clam host). Distributions of digeneans and Perkinsus sp. were similar along the Atlantic shore. However, at each sampling station and at the individual scale, no correlation between Perkinsus sp. and digenean abundance was detected. These results suggest different ecological niches used by these two parasites within a community of bivalves but a similar response to environmental factors such as temperature and salinity. Vibrio tapetis was found at relatively high prevalence in all stations for both bivalve species (from 17 % to 43 % in cockles and from 23 % to 50 % in clams), but was associated with a low prevalence of Brown Ring Disease (BRD), a shell disease caused by this pathogen. No statistically significant relationship of these parasitic bacteria with trematodes and Perkinsus sp. was evidenced in the present study...|$|R
40|$|Contamination {{of aquatic}} environments via {{anthropogenic}} release of metals {{is an increasing}} global environmental concern. The greatest concerns exist within estuarine and harbour environments, where point and non-point metal sources are prevalent. Historically, monitoring programs were initially (and largely) based on chemical analyses; however, the identification {{of a number of}} shortcomings in this approach resulted in a shift towards the complementary use of biological monitoring (biomonitoring). The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate and compare the suitability of selected aquatic invertebrate taxa biomarker responses (by production of metallothionein- MT) for assessment of aquatic environmental conditions in three coastal estuaries in Southern England: Poole Harbour, the Fal estuary and the Solent. This was delivered through a critical review of the current status of metal contamination in biota, water and sediment within these estuaries; by investigation of the suitability of selected species’ metallothioneins to act as biomarkers by assessing their correlation with metal pollution; by assessment of the effectiveness of these organisms as bioindicators in biomonitoring studies; and though investigation of the potential use of MT concentrations in these species as biomarkers of metal exposure in monitoring programmes. Legislation has been established to facilitate the protection, and enhance the quality, of all water bodies, including coastal waters and estuaries to prevent their deterioration and to ensure they achieve ‘good’ ecological health; but examination of water and sediment samples showed that historical metal pollution has not been dispersed and still affects environmental quality. In Poole Harbour, metal contamination was detected in all environmental compartments. The enclosed nature of the harbour and its secondary embayments make it vulnerable to the effects of these metal sources which disperse extremely slowly due to restricted tidal exchange; and a significant part of the pollution load remains in coastal areas close to land based contamination sources. In Poole Harbour, water was polluted with As (ranged from 29. 6 to 212. 8 ?g/l) and Hg (ranged from 0. 368 ?g/l to 11. 06 ?g/l) which are above the Environmental Quality Standard (EQS) set by the European Union dangerous substances directive (EUDSD). Sediment metals were mostly within “the possible effect range” at which adverse effects occasionally occur, according to the Canadian Sediment Quality Guidelines (CSQG). Although cockles (Cerastoderma edule) had higher tissue concentrations of Ni, Ag and Hg in areas close to pollution sources, and sponges (Haliclona oculata) had accumulated Cu and Zn with a very high magnitude, the absence of EQS for metals in living organisms’ tissues makes it difficult to specify whether the metal concentrations reached a dangerous level or not in these organisms. The results confirmed the presence of a marked metal pollution gradient in the Fal Estuary between the ‘clean’ sites in the north and east of the estuary and the ‘polluted’ sites in the west of the estuary which were historically polluted by water from mines. Moreover, the concentrations of metals in almost all of the contaminated sites in the Fal and Solent estuaries have not changed significantly over the past few decades. This study investigated the potential of MT as biomarker of metal pollution in the following wild species: two well-studied bioindicators- <b>common</b> <b>cockles</b> (C. edule) from Poole Harbour, and mussels (Mytilus edulis) from the Fal estuary and the Solent; and tested the following novel bioindicators: sponges (H. oculata) from Poole Harbour, ragworms (Hediste diversicolor) From the Fal estuary, and limpets (Patella vulgata) from the Solent. The spectrophotometric method was used to measure MT in these species as it has been reported to be a sensitive, time saving, and low-cost technique able to detect MT content in the tissues of aquatic organisms. The results showed that MT concentration in these estuarine wild invertebrates vary between sites; however, these variations were not exclusively associated with metal concentrations and that other environmental factors may explain some of the MTs variability. The many uncertainties surrounding MT in wild organisms indicate that it may have limited potential as a biomarker in estuarine environments. It is also apparent that the importance of biotic and abiotic factors at polluted sites may limit its application. In this study, transplanted mussels (M. edulis) and Manila clams (Tapes philippinarum) were used as active biomonitoring tools in Poole Harbour. It was found that under extreme conditions of metal pollution, the relationship between metal concentrations and MT deviates from linearity: a threshold appears to be reached beyond which the physiological capacity of organisms introduced to polluted areas is exceeded. In the above transplanted animals, MT induction increased to peak levels with increased metal concentration, and then declined with further increases in the concentration...|$|R

40|$|Seasonal {{variations}} in the activity of several enzymes (glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)) involved in the glutathione cellular defence system were measured in whole tissues of the <b>common</b> New Zealand <b>cockle</b> (Austrovenus stutchburyi) as biomarkers of oxidative stress. Three sites (Glendowie, Panmure, and Tiraumea) were sampled in Tamaki Estuary, Auckland, New Zealand, that represented a heavy metal contamination gradient. These sites were selected as metal contaminants can affect the activity of antioxidant enzymes by increasing the formation of reactive oxygen species, therefore these enzymes have been proposed as biomarkers of diminished health. Cockles from the three sites were expected to show differences in enzyme activities due to the gradient in metal levels. Sites were sampled monthly over a thirteen month period, from April 2007 - April 2008. Environmental co-variables (sediment silt-clay fraction, organic matter content, chlorophyll a, median grain size, cockle condition index, water temperature and salinity) were also measured in order to relate biomarker activities to them. From these measures it was established that a gradient existed in sediment properties, water parameters, and condition index, among the three study sites. Condition index significantly correlated with both GPx (r = 0. 761) and GST (r = 0. 721) activity, therefore condition index provides a good measure of overall health. The silt-clay fraction of the sediment also showed a significant negative correlation with both GPx (r = - 0. 558) and GST (r = - 0. 498). GPx was the only enzyme to have significant correlations with metal concentrations including, Pb sediment concentration (r = - 0. 561), Cu sediment concentration (r = - 0. 539) and Cu tissue concentration (r = - 0. 530). Therefore this enzyme showed the most promise as a biomarker of contamination. The highest GPx and GST activities were measured in cockles from Glendowie, this site was characterised by lower concentrations of metals. There was seasonality observed in the activity of GPx and GST. The activity of these enzymes greatly increased from January onwards, and remained elevated {{for the remainder of}} the sampling period (until April 2008) this increase however, was more pronounced at Glendowie. The increase in enzyme activity in January could have been the result of a number of reasons including 1) changes in the cockles metabolic status due to gonadal development and spawning 2) a combination of environmental co-variables not measured in this study, or 3) a recovery from a stress event that occurred prior to sampling. Both GST and GPx showed promise as biomarkers of contamination; however GR did not as there were little differences in enzyme activities among sites. Further annual sampling at these sites should be carried out to determine if the increased GST and GPx activities in summer were the result of an abnormal event or a typical seasonal variation that occurs annually...|$|R

40|$|The role {{of marine}} {{currents}} in shaping population connectivity in the <b>common</b> <b>cockle</b> Cerastoderma edule {{was investigated in}} the southern Irish Sea. C. edule {{is one of the}} most valuable and exploited shellfish species in the area, yet very little is known about its population dynamics. In the present study, coupled hydrodynamic and particle tracking models are used in conjunction with genetic data collected at twelve microsatellite loci to estimate the influence of the Celtic Sea front on larval transport between the coasts of Britain and Ireland. Genetic analysis highlights the presence of at least three genetic clusters partitioned within locations, suggesting a contact zone between separate subpopulations. Samples collected from the Irish coast are most similar to each other. On the British coast, the Burry Inlet appears genetically isolated while samples collected from the coast of Pembrokeshire show evidence of connectivity between Britain and Ireland. These results agree with the model?s predictions: away from the coastal zone, residual baroclinic currents develop along tidal mixing fronts and act as conduit systems, transporting larvae great distances. Larvae spawned in south Wales are capable of travelling west towards Ireland due to the Celtic Sea front residual current, confirming the action of the Celtic Sea front on larval transport. Sheltered, flood-dominant estuaries such as the Burry Inlet promote self-recruitment. The validation of the model using genetic data represents progress towards a sustainable future for the <b>common</b> <b>cockle,</b> and paves the way for a more effective approach to management of all Irish Sea shellfisheries.

Analyses of density dependence are sensitive to bias through measurement error. Measurement error was estimated by bootstrapping, and residual deviances were adjusted by adding process error.

Exhalant jet speeds were modelled for a range of exhalant-aperture cross-sectional areas as determined in the laboratory and a range of filtration rates derived from literature. Significant differences were found in inhalant and exhalant current velocities and properties of the inhalant flow field (acceleration and distance of influence). At comparable body weight, inhalant current velocities were lower in C. gigas than in the other species. Modelled exhalant jets were higher in C. gigas, but oriented horizontally instead of vertically as in the other species. Despite these significant differences and apparent morphological differences between the three species, absolute differences in feeding current characteristics were small and are not expected to lead to significant differences in feeding efficiency...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{nuclear energy}} {{industry}} produces radioactive waste {{at various stages}} of the fuel cycle. In the United Kingdom, spent fuel is reprocessed at the Sellafield facility in Cumbria on the North West coast of England. Waste generated at the site comprises {{a wide range of}} radionuclides including radiocarbon (14 C) which is disposed of in various forms including highly soluble inorganic carbon within the low level liquid radioactive effluent, via pipelines into the Irish Sea. This 14 C is rapidly incorporated into the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) reservoir and marine calcifying organisms, e. g. molluscs, readily utilise DIC for shell formation. This study investigated a number of sites located in Irish Sea and West of Scotland intertidal zones. Results indicate 14 C enrichment above ambient background levels in shell material {{at least as far as}} Port Appin, 265  km north of Sellafield. Of the commonly found species (blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), <b>common</b> <b>cockle</b> (Cerastoderma edule) and common periwinkle (Littorina littorea)), mussels were found to be the most highly enriched in 14 C due to the surface environment they inhabit and their feeding behaviour. Whole mussel shell activities appear to have been decreasing in response to reduced discharge activities since the early 2000 s but in contrast, there is evidence of continuing enrichment of the carbonate sediment component due to in-situ shell erosion, as well as indications of particle transport of fine 14 C-enriched material close to Sellafield...|$|E
40|$|Poole Harbour {{is typical}} of many heavily anthropologically {{impacted}} semi-enclosed estuarine coastal areas under pressure from metal pollution across the world. This study examined the physiological significance of metal burdens within that sensitive area, and assessed the potential use of metallothioneins (MT) concentrations in two organisms: the <b>common</b> <b>cockle</b> (Cerastoderma edule) and the Mermaid’s glove sponge (Haliclona oculata) for mapping the spatial extent of the biological response to metal contamination. A spectrophotometric method was applied for detection of MT in the bivalve, {{and for the first}} time to detect MT in sponges. The results show that while some metal concentrations in cockle and sponge tissues and in their surrounding environment (water and sediment) could be related to sources of metal contamination, MT values in the soft tissue of cockles and whole tissue of sponges are not. No relation could be found between MT in both cockles and sponges, and any of the tested metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Hg, Ni, Ag, Sn, Zn). Furthermore, some of the lowest MT concentrations were detected in heavily polluted areas, indicating that MT concentrations in tested organisms are not exclusively associated with metal concentrations, as other environmental factors could affect induction of this protein. Organisms probably have a high tolerance to metal contamination and chronic exposure to a high level of contamination resulted in developing a variety of detoxification mechanisms. Results indicate that further study of metal stress in this type of ecosystem may need to examine other indicator species and/or apply a different biomonitoring technique...|$|E
