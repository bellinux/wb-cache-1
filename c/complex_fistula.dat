40|$|The aim of {{surgical}} treatment of fistula-in-ano is {{to eradicate the}} suppurative process permanently without compromising faecal continence. The appearance of a recurrence of fistula-in-ano is often due to non-identification of the internal opening by the surgeon, and {{to the presence of}} <b>complex</b> <b>fistulae.</b> We evaluated the clinical course of 214 patients in a randomised. controlled trial with respect to the recurrence rate of anal fistula with or without preoperative endoanal ultrasonography.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present results of a single-center, nonrandomized, {{prospective}} study of the video-assisted anal fistula treatment (VAAFT). Methods. 68 consecutive patients with perianal fistulas were operated on using the VAAFT technique. 30 of the patients had simple fistulas, and 38 had <b>complex</b> <b>fistulas.</b> The mean follow-up time was 31 months. Results. The overall healing rate was 54. 41 % (37 of the 68 patients healed with no recurrence during the follow-up period). The results varied depending on the type of fistula. The success rate for the group with simple fistulas was 73. 3 %, whereas it was only 39. 47 % for the group with <b>complex</b> <b>fistulas.</b> Female patients achieved higher healing rates for both simple (81. 82 % versus 68. 42 %) and <b>complex</b> <b>fistulas</b> (77. 78 % versus 27. 59 %). There were no major complications. Conclusions. The results of VAAFT vary greatly depending on the type of fistula. The procedure has some drawbacks due to the rigid construction of the fistuloscope and the diameter of the shaft. The electrocautery of the fistula tract from the inside can be insufficient to close wide tracts. However, low risk of complications permits repetition of the treatment until success is achieved.

Few publications have addressed laparoscopic surgery for <b>complex</b> <b>fistulas</b> in Crohn’s disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the feasibility of such an approach. All patients who underwent a laparoscopic ileocecal resection for <b>complex</b> enterovisceral <b>fistulas</b> between January 2004 and August 2011 were included. They were matched to a control group undergoing operation for nonfistulizing Crohn’s disease according to age, sex, nutritional state, preoperative use of steroids, and type of resection performed. Matching was performed blind to the peri- and postoperative results of each patient. The 2 groups were compared in terms of operative time, conversion to open surgery, morbidity and mortality rates, and length of stay. RESULTS: Eleven patients presenting with 13 <b>complex</b> <b>fistulas</b> were included and matched with 22 controls. Group 1 contained 5 ileosigmoid fistulas (38 %), 3 ileotransverse fistulas (23 %), 3 ileovesical fistulas (23 %), 1 colocolic fistula (8 %), and 1 ileosalpingeal fistula (8 %). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of operative time (120 (range, 75 – 270) vs 120 (range, 50 – 160) minutes, p = 0. 65), conversion to open surgery (9 % vs 0 %, p = 0. 33), stoma creation (9 % vs 14 %, p = 1), global postoperative morbidity (18 % vs 32 %, p = 0. 68), and major complications (Dindo III: 0 % vs 9 %, p = 0. 54; Dindo IV: 0 % vs 0 %, p = 1), as well as in terms of length of stay (8 (range, 7 – 32) vs 9 (range, 5 – 17) days, p = 0. 72).

40|$|International audienceBackground and aims: Anal fistula plug (AFP) is a {{bioabsorbable}} bioprosthesis used in ano-perineal fistula treatment. We {{aimed to}} assess efficacy {{and safety of}} AFP in fistulising ano-perineal Crohn's disease (FAP-CD). Methods: In a multicentre, open-label, randomized controlled trial we compared seton removal alone (control group) with AFP insertion (AFP group) in 106 Crohn's disease patients with non or mildly active disease having at least one ano-perineal fistula tract drained {{for more than one}} month. Patients with abscess (collection ≥ 3 mm on MRI) or recto-vaginal fistulas were excluded. Randomization was stratified in simple or complex fistulas according to AGA classification. Primary end point was fistula closure at week 12. Results 54 patients were randomized to AFP group (control group 52). Median fistula duration was 23 [10 - 53] months. Median Crohn's Disease Activity Index at baseline was 81 [45 - 135]. Fistula closure at week 12 was achieved in 31. 5 % patients in AFP group and in 23. 1 % in control group (relative risk stratified on AGA classification, RR: 1. 31; 95 %CI: 0. 59 - 4. 02; p= 0. 19).

40|$|Background Traditionally proctectomy {{has been}} the {{treatment}} for severe, <b>complex</b> <b>fistula</b> in ano from Crohn’s disease. However, based {{on the success of}} rectal advancement flaps in Crohn’s disease, circumferential transanal sleeve advancement flaps (TSAFs) were proposed for this subgroup of patients with severe fistula. Methods From 1991 to 1995, 13 patients (12 women) with severe perianal Crohn’s disease and multiple fistula tracts underwent a TSAF procedure. Data were collected retrospectively using a standard data sheet. Results There were no postoperative deaths or major morbidity. One year after surgery, the fistula had healed in eight of 13 patients (with three requiring additional surgery before healing). Of patients in whom the procedure failed, three underwent proctectomy for progression of disease and the other two had recurrence of a rectovaginal fistula 6 and 8 months after surgery. Of six variables evaluated (previous procedure, steroid use, steroid dosage, associated Crohn’s disease, associated procedures and diverting stoma), only associated procedures were significantly related to a successful outcome (P 0 · 008).

40|$|We {{discuss the}} case of a man with an unusual {{complication}} of gallstone disease. An 85 -year-old patient presented to the emergency department with a 3 -week history of abdominal pain in the right upper abdominal quadrant. Thoracoabdominal radiography demonstrated that the whole extrahepatic biliary tree, including the common bile duct, common hepatic duct, gallbladder, and left and right hepatic ducts, were visibly delineated by air. The operative findings revealed a small shrunken gallbladder, a fistula between the gallbladder fundus and the gastric antrum, and a cholecystohepatic fistula, corresponding to Mirizzi syndrome, type II. A large gallstone was found impacted in the jejunum. This patient seems to have developed initially a cholecystohepatic fistula. Due to the acute inflammatory process, the stone eroded through the gallbladder wall and into the gastric antrum, passing from the antrum into the small bowel, where it became impacted. We suggest that the natural history of Mirizzi syndrome does not end with a cholecystobiliary fistula but that the continuous inflammation in the triangle of Calot may result in a <b>complex</b> <b>fistula</b> involving not only the biliary tract but also the adjacent viscera...|$|E

40|$|Background. Perianal Crohn’s disease (CD) can be challenging. Despite {{the high}} {{incidence}} of fistulizing CD, literature lacks clear guidelines. Several medical, surgical, and combined treatment modalities have been proposed, but evidences are scarce. Methods. We searched the literature to assess the facets of perianal CD, with particular focus on <b>complex</b> <b>fistulae.</b> Disease epidemiology, classification, diagnosis, activity scoring systems, and medical-surgical treatments were assessed. Results. Perianal fistulizing CD is common, frequently associated with upper gastrointestinal and colorectal CD. <b>Complex</b> <b>fistulas</b> often require repeated treatments. Continence is a major concern when dealing with repeated procedures. A prudent pathway is to resolve active sepsis and to limit damages, delaying a definitive treatment to the time when acute phase has been controlled. The improved diagnostic techniques allow better preoperative planning and are useful in monitoring the response to treatment. Besides newer devices, cell-based treatments are promising tools which have recently enriched the treatment portfolio. However, the need for proctectomy is still disturbingly high in CD patients with <b>complex</b> perianal <b>fistulae.</b> Conclusions. Perianal CD can impair quality of life and lead to need for proctectomy. A staged approach is reasonable.

40|$|Purpose: We aim {{to present}} our {{experience}} for the repair of vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) with special reference to surgical approach. Materials and Methods: From January 1999 to June 2005, 52 VVF patients with mean age of 32 years underwent operative treatment. Fistulas {{were divided into two}} groups, simple and complex, depending on site, size, etiology and associated anomalies. Simple VVFs were approached through the vaginal route and complex VVFs via the transabdominal route. Patients were evaluated at two to three weeks initially, three-monthly twice and later depending on symptoms. Results: Thirty-two (61. 5 %) had simple fistulas and 20 (38. 5 %) <b>complex</b> <b>fistulas.</b> The most common etiology was obstetric trauma in 31 (59. 6 %) patients, while the second most common cause was post hysterectomy VVF. Thirty-two (61. 5 %) patients were managed by transvaginal route, of which 17 had supratrigonal and 15 trigonal fistulas. Twenty (38. 5 %) patients with <b>complex</b> <b>fistulas</b> were managed by abdominal route. The mean blood loss, postoperative pain and mean hospital stay were shorter in transvaginal repair. Eleven (21. 2 %) patients required ancillary procedures for various other associated anomalies at the time of fistula repair. Three patients failed repair giving a success rate of 94. 2 %. At a mean follow-up of three years 48 women were sexually active, of these 10 (19. 2 %) complained of mild to moderate dyspareunia. Conclusion: Most of the simple fistulas irrespective their locations are easily accessible transvaginally while in <b>complex</b> <b>fistulas</b> we recommend the transabdominal approach.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish the relationship of Mirizzi syndrome with cholecystoenteric fistulas. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients older than aged 18 years submitted to emergency or elective cholecystectomy from 1995 to 2006. Of 5, 673 cholecystectomies performed during that period, we found 327 (5. 7 %) patients with Mirizzi {{syndrome and}} 105 (1. 8 %) patients with cholecystoenteric fistula. Ninety-four (89. 5 %) patients with cholecystoenteric fistula also had an associated Mirizzi syndrome.

40|$|Crohn's disease (CD) is {{complicated}} by perianal fistulas in up to 40 % of patients at some time {{during the course of}} their disease. Perianal fistulas are particularly frequent when the distal portion of the digestive tract is involved and {{are one of the most}} difficult sequelae of Crohn's disease, with an often incomplete response to treatment.

Modalities used to diagnose and classify Crohn's perianal fistulas tracks with a high diagnostic accuracy include examination under anaesthesia, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging and endoanal ultrasonography. The classification of the fistula as simple or complex depends on the anatomical fistula track, the activity and the clinical severity of the disease.

The least invasive methods involve filling out the fistula tract with fibrin glue or introduction of a anal fistula plug into the fistula canal following thorough curettage. A review shows that the new techniques involving biologically derived products do not confer any significant advantages. Therefore the question inevitably arises as to whether the combination of a partial or limited fistulectomy, i. e. of the extrasphincteric portion of the fistula, and preservation of the sphincter muscle by repairing the section of the <b>complex</b> anal <b>fistula</b> running through the sphincter muscle and filling it with a fistula plug produces better results.

30|$|The optimal {{treatment}} of enterocutaneous fistulas in CD remains debated: in the past, surgical resection of the diseased bowel plus fistula debridement through abdominal wall and subcutaneous planes was generally performed. In the last decade, medical therapy changed with introduction of biologics and immunomodulators. Following experience with perianal inflammatory disease, monoclonal antibodies against tumour necrosis factor are increasingly used: with correct patient selection, {{in the absence}} of stenosis and <b>complex</b> <b>fistulas,</b> infliximab achieves good response in postoperative and, to a minor extent, spontaneous ECFs too [16, 21, 22].|$|R

To determine the fecal incontinence and recurrence rate {{in patients with}} <b>complex</b> <b>fistula</b> in ano managed with cable tie seton at a tertiary care teaching hospital. Methods. This is a prospective case series of patients with complex anal fistula i. e. recurrent fistula or encircling> 30 % of external anal sphincter, managed with cable tie seton from March 2003 to March 2009. Patients were seen in the clinic after 72 hours of seton insertion under anesthesia and then every other week. Each time the cable-tie was tightened if found loose without anesthesia and incontinence was inquired according to wexner’s score. Results. Seventy nine patients were treated {{during the study period}} with the age (mean ± standard deviation) of 41 ± 10. 6 years and. The seton was tightened with a median of six times (3 – 15 times range). Complete healing was achieved in 11. 2 ± 5. 7 weeks. All the patients were followed for a minimum period of one year and none of the patients had any incontinence. Recurrence was found in 4 (5 %) patients. Conclusion. The cable tie seton is safe, cost effective and low morbidity option for the treatment of complex fistulae-in-ano. It can, therefore, be recommended as the standard of treatment for complex fistulae-in-ano requiring the placement of a seton. 1...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract {{technique}} {{is a new}} sphincter saving method with good results in management of anal fistula, but few studies report long-term follow-up data. Material and methods: This study investigated the use of ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract as a sphincter saving method based on long term results. This was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. The study was conducted at two tertiary care university medical centers. 36 patients with <b>complex</b> <b>fistula</b> from January 2010 to January 2014 treated with classic ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract were retrospectively followed. Demographic data, previous repair attempts, the type of the fistula and score of fecal continence were collected. The procedure was performed by colorectal surgeons. Primary healing rate, failures and fecal incontinence score of patients were followed for 6 - 48 months. Results: A total of 36 patients underwent ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract during 24 months. The {{mean age of the}} patients was 35 years and 50 % had two previous attempts at surgery. A total of 25 patients (69 / 5 %) had high transsphincteric fistula. The mean follow up was 27 months. Successful fistula closure was achieved in 63 / 8 % of the patients (23 of 36). The mean time of recurrence was 4. 5 weeks. Only one (2 / 77 %) patient reported gas incontinence (score: 3) after the procedure. Conclusion: The recurrence rate and fecal incontinence were measured. The ligation of intersphincteric fistula is a promising sphincter-preserving procedure that is simple and safe.

40|$|Abstract Background Individuals with {{impaired}} immunity are {{at higher}} risk of perianal diseases. Concerning <b>complex</b> anal <b>fistulas</b> impaired healing and complication rates are also higher. Definitive treatment of a fistula aims controlling the purulent discharge and prevents its recurrence. It depends mainly on the trajectory of the fistula and the underlying disease. We present {{a case of a}} HIV-positive patient with a <b>complex</b> extrasphincteric anal <b>fistula</b> who was treated successfully with fibrin glue application. We further, discuss tips and tricks when applying fibrin glue as plugging material in <b>complex</b> anal <b>fistulas.</b> Case presentation A sixty-one-year-old HIV-positive male referred to us for warts and extrasphincteric fistula. Because of the patients' immunological status, we opted against surgery and recommended fibrin glue plugging. The patient was discharged the same day. A follow-up examination was performed 5 days after the initial fibrin glue application showing that the fistula canal was obstructed. Three months and a year post-intervention the fistula tract remains closed. Conclusion The best treatment for a disease gives at least the same result with the other treatments with minimised risk {{for the life of the}} patient and minimal application effort. Conservative closure of fistula with fibrin plugging is simple, safe and with less morbidity than surgery. Our patient was successfully treated without endangering his life despite his precarious medical state. Not everybody believes in the effectiveness of fibrin glue application, however we consider this solution in cases of <b>complex</b> <b>fistulas</b> at least as primary procedure in special populations such as the immunosupressed. </p...|$|R

While the majority of fistulas in ano result from infection of the anal crypts, complex, recurrent, and/or nonhealing fistulas should always raise the suspicion of a chronic underlying condition. In this paper, we present a 30 -year-old male patient with a diagnosis of a <b>complex</b> suprasphincteric <b>fistula</b> caused by a surgical thread left behind after an orthopedic hip operation performed sixteen years ago. Partial fistulectomy, extraction of the foreign material, and debridement procedures were performed. Few cases of such <b>complex</b> <b>fistulas</b> in ano due to foreign materials have been described in the literature. After careful history-taking, meticulous physical examination under general anesthesia {{should be done in}} order to deal with this rare type of fistula. 1...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: About 30 - 50 % of {{patients}} with Crohn's disease (CD) develop fistulae, implying significant disease burden and complicated clinical management. AIM: To assess appropriate use of therapy for fistulizing CD patients enrolled in the Swiss Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort using criteria developed by the European Panel on the Appropriateness of Crohn's disease Therapy. METHODS: Specific questionnaires were used to gather information on disease and its management. We assessed appropriateness of therapy at enrolment for adult CD patients with one or several fistulae. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-eight CD patients had fistulizing disease, of which 80 % had <b>complex</b> <b>fistulae</b> and 32 % currently had active draining fistulae. Mean age (s. d.) at diagnosis was 27 years (11), 51 % males. Of the patients, 78 % were judged as having globally an appropriate therapy, which was more often given for <b>complex</b> <b>fistulae</b> (87 %) than for simple fistulae (67 %). Antibiotics, azathioprine/MP, methotrexate and conservative surgery were almost always appropriate. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha was considered globally appropriate (91 %), although most often with an uncertain indication. The 5 ASA compounds, steroids and aggressive surgery were most often inappropriate (84 %, 58 % and 86 % respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Formal appropriateness criteria for CD therapy were applied to a national cohort of IBD patients. For {{more than three-quarters of}} the patients with fistulizing CD, therapy was globally appropriate...|$|R
