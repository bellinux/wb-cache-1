[...] Hammerstein was interviewed by the Saturday Review about the adaptation: [...] "We want the kids who see it to recognize the story they know. Children can be very critical on that score. But, of course, their parents will be watching too, so we have tried to humanize the characters without altering the familiar plot structure." [...] The musical had to fit into the 90-minute program with six commercial breaks, so it was divided into six short acts.

Writing for far-left portal E-novine, Vladan Petković was extremely critical, seeing Parada as [...] "nothing more than a marketing trick" [...] while citing its main problem to be the fact that [...] "protagonists are caricatures while antagonists are stereotypes". He continues: [...] "Dragojević tried his hardest to pack the film with witty dialogues and thus provide new material for the Balkan movie audiences favourite activity - citing movie one-liners. And I must say I laughed a few times at some original jokes, but for that to truly work well, the movie must be good as a whole unit (such as Maratonci..., Ko to tamo peva, Varljivo leto 68, Kako je propao rokenrol...), which Parada isnt. It stays in the realm of politically correct fuck-about thats camouflaged in political incorrectness".

50|$|In {{the autumn}} of 2015, {{following}} well received previews of Love Birds at the LOST Theatre and excellent reviews that followed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival for Love Birds official run, Robert Sherman was approached by the LOST Theatre in Stockwell for permission to do a four-week, extendable run of Bumblescratch with the associate creative director of LOST, Jack Bowman directing. After several months of preparation Sherman and Bowman were informed that LOST had to withdraw its offer for lack of funding. With orchestrations {{and other aspects of}} the show already commissioned, Sherman decided to proceed with a one-night celebrity gala performance in aid of Variety. That show took place on September 4, 2016. The director/choreographer for the Adelphi incarnation of the show was Stewart Nicholls who had collaborated with Sherman on two previous shows Love Birds and A Spoonful of Sherman. Love Birds designer, Gabriella Slade also provided the design for Bumblescratch. Film and TV composing veteran, and longtime associate of Nicholls Rowland Lee was brought on to orchestrate the ten piece band. Sherman, Nicholls and Lee met regularly from March to August to work on the orchestrations. Tom Kelly was appointed Music Director. Lighting Design was by David W. Kidd with Lighting Programming and Operating done by Marcus Walland for White Light. Tony Gayle was the Head Sound Engineer. Video Projection Design was done by Daniel Denton. Working in tandem with the designer was Costume Supervisor, Justin Allin. The Assistant Director/Choreographer was Kimberley Moses. The Assistant Musical Director was James Church. Orchestral Contracting was provided by Nick Norton-Smith. The Fight Director was Paul Benzing. <b>Casting</b> <b>Direction</b> was done by Jane Deitch. The Production Manager was Leigh Porter.

40|$|Abstract. Aligned carbon nanotubes(CNTs) /epoxy resin(EP) {{composites}} {{were prepared}} under a low magnetic field (B< 500 mT) induction. The effect of different magnetic fields on the electrical and dielectrical properties of composites was investigated. The {{results show that}} the CNTs are aligned with rod-like aggregations instead of single CNTs when the magnetic field direction is vertical to the <b>casting</b> <b>direction</b> of samples, then electric conductivity, permittivity, dielectric loss of the composite are improved. And a larger magnetic field intensity and a bigger mould capacity can help the effect of magnetic field induction. However the CNTs are seriously aggregated and the electrical properties of composites change worse when the magnetic field direction is parallel to the <b>casting</b> <b>direction</b> of samples...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an improved}} method for the detailed geometrical characterization of perlite-metal syntactic foam. This novel metallic foam {{is created by}} infiltrating a packed bed of expanded perlite particles with liquid aluminium alloy. The geometry of the solidified metal is thus defined by the perlite particle shape, size and morphology. The method {{is based on a}} segmented micro-computed tomography data and allows for automated determination of the distributions of pore size, sphericity, orientation and location. The pore (i. e. particle) size distribution and pore orientation is determined by a multi-criteria k -nearest neighbour algorithm for pore identification. The results indicate a weak density gradient parallel to the <b>casting</b> <b>direction</b> and a slight preference of particle orientation perpendicular to the <b>casting</b> <b>direction...</b>|$|E
