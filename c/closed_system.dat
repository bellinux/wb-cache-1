5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a <b>closed</b> <b>system</b> has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} <b>closed</b> <b>system,</b> the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can {{be considered to be}} an artifact of the potential field {{in the same way that}} the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E
5|$|More generally, in a <b>closed</b> <b>system</b> of particles, all {{internal}} forces are balanced. The particles may accelerate {{with respect to}} each other but the center of mass of the system will not accelerate. If an external force acts on the system, it will make the center of mass accelerate in proportion to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.|$|E

5000|$|Ludwig Bertalanffy {{describes}} {{two types}} of systems: open <b>systems</b> and <b>closed</b> <b>systems.</b> The open systems are systems that allow interactions between their internal elements and the environment. An open system {{is defined as a}} “system in exchange of matter with its environment, presenting import and export, building-up and breaking-down of its material components.” <b>Closed</b> <b>systems,</b> on the other hand, are held to be isolated from their environment. Equilibrium thermodynamics, for example, is a field of study that applies to <b>closed</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
5|$|Living organisms must {{obey the}} laws of thermodynamics, which {{describe}} the transfer of heat and work. The second law of thermodynamics states that in any <b>closed</b> <b>system,</b> the amount of entropy (disorder) cannot decrease. Although living organisms' amazing complexity appears to contradict this law, life is possible as all organisms are open systems that exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. Thus living systems are not in equilibrium, but instead are dissipative systems that maintain their state of high complexity by causing a larger increase in the entropy of their environments. The metabolism of a cell achieves this by coupling the spontaneous processes of catabolism to the non-spontaneous processes of anabolism. In thermodynamic terms, metabolism maintains order by creating disorder.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} aging Class C trains, from 1985 to 1987, ten T4s were {{converted}} to T1300. They were equipped with a pantograph, received a new front and the doors were moved. Six additional T4s were converted in 1989, and given the designation T8. These only had the pantographs equipped and kept the same front and door arrangement. With {{the introduction of the}} T1300, the western lines could remove the conductor and have single-manned trains with the motorman selling tickets. The T1300-units have had better regularity than the older models they replaced. However, because they are designed for a <b>closed</b> <b>system</b> with automatic train protection, the braking systems are not sufficiently dimensioned for when the drivers use line of sight to regulate the speed and distances between trains. The 1300 units were numbered 1301–1349. After the conversions, Oslo Sporveier operated 49 T1300-cars and 146 T1000-cars. The trains were originally painted red with a beige cheatline.|$|E

40|$|In {{studies in}} {{developing}} countries, <b>closed</b> <b>systems</b> for mechanically mixing and loading hazardous pesticides {{have been shown}} to reduce exposure to workers. To evaluate the efficacy of <b>closed</b> <b>systems</b> in preventing worker exposure in the developing world, a cross sectional study was conducted at rural crop dusting airports in the cotton growing region of Nicaragua. Worker exposure was evaluated by measuring the activity of erythrocyte cholinesterase in the field with a new design battery operated colorimeter. The 10 mixer loaders at four airstrips with <b>closed</b> <b>systems</b> were compared with the 16 mixer loaders at four airstrips where pesticides were hand poured. Paradoxically, cholinesterase activity was 1. 1 IU/ml blood (95 % Cl 0. 49 - 1. 8) lower (inhibited) among workers in airstrips with <b>closed</b> <b>systems</b> than among workers hand pouring insecticides, after adjusting for weight of organophosphates sprayed in the past 14 days, and for prior training in safe use of pesticides. Mixer loaders with prior training had cholinesterase activity 0. 83 IU (95 % Cl 0. 30 - 1. 4) higher than untrained workers, and the weight of organophosphates sprayed was also a statistically significant predictor in the model. Unfortunately, management viewed the <b>closed</b> <b>systems</b> primarily as a production tool, rather than as a way to protect workers. Airstrips with <b>closed</b> <b>systems</b> were able to apply an average of 3250 lb organophosphates per worker in the 14 days before the survey compared with 849 lb per worker in airstrips without <b>closed</b> <b>systems.</b> Only three of 10 mixer-loaders at airstrips with <b>closed</b> <b>systems</b> had received formal training in safer use of pesticides. Because of shortage of personnel and transport, it was difficult for the responsible government agencies to train workers adequately and to enforce pesticide health and safety standards at multiple dispersed worksites...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Industrialized <b>closing</b> <b>systems</b> {{appear as}} {{rational}} solutions in steel-structured construction. These <b>closing</b> <b>systems,</b> consisting of multi-layered panels, {{have been applied}} in projects where {{it is intended to}} obtain a high sound transmission loss without raising the cost and without using a lot of mass. However, acoustic isolation depends on several factors, including the type of connection between the panels, requiring a preliminary study of the acoustic performance of the <b>closing</b> <b>system</b> to prevent future interventions. This paper uses a simplified graphical method to evaluate the influence of the type of connection (line-line, line-punctual or punctual-punctual) of industrialized closing panels on the estimation of the sound transmission loss that occurs across the wall constituted by these panels. The panels are combined, forming multi-layered closings interleaved by a layer of air, either without or with a sound-absorbing material between them. The results show {{that it is necessary to}} check the effectiveness of each type of fastening of the <b>closing</b> <b>systems</b> because, for example, for the frequency range between 500 and 2, 000 Hz, the sound transmission loss of a <b>closing</b> <b>system</b> consisting of cementitious plate with glass wool and line-punctual and punctual-punctual connections exceeds in 6. 25 % the sound transmission loss of the same system with line-line fastening.
