40|$|Abstract—In {{traditional}} interval computations, {{we assume}} that the interval data corresponds to guaranteed interval bounds, and that fuzzy estimates provided by experts are correct. In practice, measuring instruments are not 100 % reliable, and experts are not 100 % reliable, we may have estimates which are “way off”, intervals which do not contain the actual values at all. Usually, we know the percentage of such outlier un-reliable measurements. However, it is desirable to check that the reliability of the actual data is indeed within the given percentage. The problem of <b>checking</b> (<b>gauging)</b> this reliability is, in general, NP-hard; in reasonable cases, there exist feasible algorithms for solving this problem.

40|$|We present new and {{explicit}} formulae for the one-loop integrands of scattering amplitudes in non-supersymmetric gauge theory and gravity, valid {{for any number}} of particles. The results exhibit the colour-kinematics duality in gauge theory and the double-copy relation to gravity, in a form that was recently observed in supersymmetric theories. The new formulae are expressed in a particular representation of the loop integrand, with only one quadratic propagator, which arises naturally from the framework of the loop-level scattering equations. The starting point in our work are the expressions based on the scattering equations that were recently derived from ambitwistor string theory. We turn these expressions into explicit formulae depending only on the loop momentum, the external momenta and the external polarisations. These formulae are valid in any number of spacetime dimensions for pure Yang-Mills theory (gluon) and its natural double copy, NS-NS gravity (graviton, dilaton, B-field), and we also present formulae in four spacetime dimensions for pure gravity (graviton). We perform several tests of our results, such as <b>checking</b> <b>gauge</b> invariance and directly matching our four-particle formulae to previously known expressions.

40|$|We present non-perturbative {{solutions}} for the fermion and boson propagators of QED in both three- and four-dimensions, and QCD. In doing so, we solve the coupled system of Schwinger-Dyson equations numerically in Euclidean space, investigating criticality, gauge dependence and phenomenology of the solutions. We do so by exploiting a new and novel three-point ansatz, the Kizilersü-Pennington vertex, designed to satisfy multiplicative renormalisability in unquenched QED. The efficacy of this is demonstrated numerically for QED(_ 4), where we find a marked improvement in the gauge-invarance of the photon wave-function. The critical coupling associated with dynamical mass generation is investigated {{for a variety of}} gauges; remarkably a lessening of this dependence is seen, despite the ansatz’s origins from a massless theory, which is improved further by constructing a hybrid system. As with many studies in the past, we apply this ansatz to the three-dimensional non-compact formulation of QED, <b>checking</b> <b>gauge</b> covariance of the propagators through a momentum-space formulation of the Landau-Khalatnikov-Pradkin transformations. The critical dependence on the number of active fermions was investigated, with the gauge dependence of the condensate unresolved. As an aside, we found numerically that LKF transforming the propagators gave rise to a constant condensate; a fact supported analytically through an explicit proof. We turn our attention towards QCD, where we explore a variety of phenomeno-logical models, including the full ghost-gluon system, in which we make comparisons between traditional vertices and the new KP-Vertex. These models are used in a determination of the physical quark condensate for massive quarks, through the exploitation of a class of non-positive definite solutions accessible for small quark masses. Finally, we examine Generalised Ward-Takahashi identities, which hold promise to further constrain the tranvserse part of the vertex. The identity is shown to hold true at one-loop through an explicit calculation, and a constraint on one of the basis coefficients is given as an example of its use.
