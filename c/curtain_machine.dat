5000|$|Invented by John Livesey in Nottingham in 1846, lace <b>curtain</b> <b>machine</b> was {{initially}} {{seen as a}} form of a Leavers machine- a modification of the Circular. The Leavers mesh tends to be hexagonal while the <b>Curtain</b> <b>machine</b> gives a straight mesh. The use of Jacquards for producing patterned lace was well established. At the 1851 Great Exhibition curtains 5 yard cm long by 2 yard cm wide were displayed. The spacious designs required over 12000 Jacquard cards. The curtain Lace industry prospered now the fashion was for large rising sash windows.|$|E
5000|$|A copy of {{the theatre}} is visible in Ingmar Bergman's 1975 film version of The Magic Flute. According to film {{historian}} Peter Cowie's notes for the DVD release of the film, Bergman wanted to recreate {{as closely as possible}} the original 1791 production in the Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna, and originally hoped to film in the Drottningholm theatre. However, [...] "the scenery was considered too fragile to accommodate a film crew. So the stage - complete with wings, <b>curtains,</b> and wind <b>machines</b> - was painstakingly copied and erected in the studios of the Swedish Film Institute". Introductory exterior shots of the theatre are, however, visible in the film.|$|R
5000|$|In {{producing}} the opera, Bergman sought {{to fulfill his}} early dream (see above) of a production in the Drottningholm Palace Theatre (one of the few surviving Baroque theatres in the world). This setting would also approximate {{the conditions of the}} original 1791 production in the Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna. The introductory exterior shots of the film are intended to suggest that it was indeed filmed in the Drottningholm theatre. However, the scenery at Drottningholm [...] "was considered too fragile to accommodate a film crew. So the stage - complete with wings, <b>curtains,</b> and wind <b>machines</b> - was painstakingly copied and erected in the studios of the Swedish Film Institute".|$|R

50|$|The lace <b>curtain</b> <b>machine,</b> is a lace {{machine that}} {{was invented by}} John Livesey in Nottingham in 1846. It was an {{adaptation}} of John Heathcoat's bobbinet machine. It made the miles of curtaining which screened Victorian and later windows.|$|E
50|$|The Old Loughborough {{became the}} {{standard}} lacemaking machine, particularly the 1820 form {{known as the}} Circular producing two-twist plain net. The smooth, unpatterned tulle produced on these machines was {{on a par with}} real, handmade lace net. Heathcoat’s bobbinet machine is so ingeniously designed that the ones used today have suffered little alteration. However during the next 30 years inventors were patenting improvements to their machines. The ones that stand out are the Pusher machine, the Levers machine (now spelled Leavers) and the Nottingham lace <b>curtain</b> <b>machine.</b> Each of these developed into separate machines. Others were the Traverse Warp machine and the Straight Bolt machine.|$|E
50|$|The frame {{viewed from}} the front is similar to Leavers machine. Its action is {{different}} as it produces a square net rather than a hexagonal one. The Nottingham lace <b>curtain</b> <b>machine</b> only has one warp and the patterning threads are carried on a spools not on a beam. The terms to describe the actions {{are the same as}} those used for a Leavers machine: rise, fall, right, left, sley, carriage, comb et c. The lace is collected at the top, unlike the Pusher machine where it is at the bottom, It is collected on a take up beam; a spiky roller called the porcupine beneath it, regulated the take up tension.|$|E
50|$|Born in Newmilns in 1821, Joseph Hood {{became a}} major player in the lace industry. By the age of 21, he had already developed, {{manufactured}} and supplied many Jacquard Looms and throughout his life, was responsible for many weaving innovations. Handloom weaving however was in decline. The introduction of the power loom in 1877 and general move towards automation left many weavers unemployed, resulting in a population drop as many left Newmilns to find work. Joseph Hood and his colleague, Hugh Morton, installed a lace <b>curtain</b> <b>machine</b> in Newmilns in 1876 and very quickly, others followed suit. Within ten years, a further eight companies had formed, providing work for over 1,500 people.|$|E
50|$|Bobbinet {{machines}} were invented in 1808 by John Heathcoat. He studied the hand movements of a Northamptonshire manual lace maker and reproduced {{them in the}} roller-locker machine. The 1809 version of this machine (patent no.3216) {{became known as the}} Old Loughborough, it was 18 in wide and was designed for use with cotton. The Old Loughborough became the standard lacemaking machine, particularly the 1824 form known as the Circular, producing two-twist plain net. The smooth, unpatterned tulle produced on these machines was on a par with real, handmade lace net. Heathcoat’s bobbinet machine is so ingeniously designed that the ones used today have suffered little alteration. During the next 30 years inventors were patenting improvements to their machines. The ones that stand out are the Pusher machine, the Levers machine (now spelled Leavers) and the Nottingham lace <b>curtain</b> <b>machine.</b> Each of these developed into separate machines. Others were the Traverse Warp machine and the Straight Bolt machine.|$|E
