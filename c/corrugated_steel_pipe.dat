Therefore, it {{is important to}} be able to accurately predict flow conditions within a stream crossing for high and low flow periods. This paper evaluates the effect of relative water depth on the hydraulic roughness of culverts at low discharge. A 21 m long, 0. 8 m diameter <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> with 0. 068 × 0. 013 m annular corrugations was used. For relative depths below 0. 5, Manning’s n was found to increase with decreasing relative depth.

While Manning’s equation does perform reasonably well, the percent difference from the measured to predicted water levels warrants the use of an additional prediction method at low flows...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Buried {{corrugated}} steel culverts are universally {{regarded as a}} structure with strong deformation adaptability and dispersed the upper load by {{corrugated steel}} structures surrounding soil constraints to enhance the carrying capacity {{and the use of}} soil-structure interaction. A lot of factors influence the earth pressure of the buried corrugated steel culvert, such as culvert stiffness, physical characteristics of the backfill (bulk density, deformation modulus and internal friction angle), geometry of structure and backfilling height. The finite element program of ANSYS has been used to research the elastic modulus, Poisson’s ratio, internal friction angle of soil, inertia moment of corrugated steel plate and pipe diameter affect the rigidity and flexibility of buried corrugated steel culvert. By defining path lines in the finite element post-processing, extracting and comparing the horizontal and vertical directions soil displacements along the lines, and doing impact pa-rameter analysis.

40|$|Soil-steel {{composite}} bridge {{refers to}} structures where a buried flexible <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> works in composite action {{with the surrounding}} soil. These structures are being increasingly used in road and railway projects {{as an alternative to}} standard type bridges, e. g. short- and medium span concrete beam- and portal frame bridges. On account of their economic advantage and short and easy construction operation, soil-steel composite bridges are getting more popular as railway crossings located far from the cities {{at the heart of the}} nature. In this research, the dynamic behaviour of soil-steel composite bridges under high-speed train passages is studied. The studied case is a short span soil-steel composite railway bridge located in Märsta close to Stockholm. The behaviour of the bridge is first observed through field measurements in terms of deflections, stresses, and accelerations at several locations on the bridge. The measured responses are then analysed in order to predict the properties of the soil and steel material working in composite action. Subsequently, 2 D and 3 D finite element models are developed in order to simulate the behaviour of the bridge. The models are calibrated using the field measurements through several parametric studies. The 3 D-model also enables estimation of the load distribution, which is found to increase at higher train speeds. An effective width to be used in 2 D analyses is proposed. Finally, the response of the bridge is studied under high-speed train models according to Eurocode...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the design, construction, and laboratory and field testing of a box culvert bridge reinforced with glass FRP (GFRP) bars. The bridge was constructed to replace a bridge that was built in the early 1980 s and consisted of three concrete-incased <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipes.</b> Due to excessive corrosion of the <b>steel</b> <b>pipes,</b> the original bridge became unsafe to operate. The new box culvert units were designed for maximum forces determined in accordance with AASHTO design guidelines. A concrete precaster fabricated the box culvert units that were reinforced entirely with GFRP bars pre-bent and cut to size by the manufacturer. Two specimens were tested in the lab to verify their design and performance. The boxes were subjected to quasi-static loading cycles up to failure. Deformations and reinforcement strains were measured throughout the test. Test results compared well with theoretical values. The new bridge was opened to traffic in October 1999. The long-term performance of the new bridge is being monitored through periodic in-situ load tests, the first of which was conducted eight months after construction. Deflection measurements taken during the test were small and indicated an elastic bridge behavior...|$|R
40|$|A {{deteriorated}} concrete {{box culvert}} conveying {{a tributary of}} the Saugeen River under Highway 21 in Ontario had reached the end of its lifespan and was in need of replacement. The tributary supports a diverse range of coldwater fish species such as Rainbow Trout; however, fish passage, particularly upstream migration, has been cut off since the culvert and highway were constructed over seventy-five years ago. Specifically, fish passage has been hindered by shallow sheet flow along the sixty metre flat bottom, excessive velocities associated with the smooth, seven percent gradient, and a perched barrier at the downstream outlet. A key component of the culvert replacement was an effort to improve the overall condition of the tributary’s natural environment, including the promotion of fish passage and migration opportunities. The culvert replacement project undertaken by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) and MMM Group, coupled resources with the Saugeen Ojibway Nation (SON) Environment office, Parsons biologists, and Aquafor geomorphologists. The most ecologically sensitive replacement methodology of an open bottom structure was not viable for this project as it would have required a full closure of the Highway for approximately four months. A circular steel pipe culvert installed through tunneling was designed to by-pass and replace the existing concrete box culvert. In an effort to mitigate the current barriers to fish with the new pipe culvert, a prefabricated corrugated steel slip liner with engineered baffle arrangement was integrated into the design. The baffle configuration and geometry was designed by Jason Duguay (Université de Sherbrooke) and Ken Hannaford (Gov. NFLD), and the slip liner construction by the <b>Corrugated</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>Pipe</b> Institute. Construction of the new culvert and slip liner was completed in December, 2015, and a two year monitoring program will be undertaken to assess the effectiveness of barrier mitigation and geomorphic stability of the tributary...|$|E
40|$|Years of {{dependable}} {{service and}} a multitude of wide ranging installations {{have led to the}} <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> industry {{to play a major role}} in modern engineering technology. Flexible steel conduits play an important role in the form of culverts, storm sewers, subdrains, spillways, underpasses, conveyor conduits and service tunnels; for highways, railways, airports, municipalities, recreation areas, industrial parks, flood and conservation projects, water pollution abatement and many other programs. In recent years developments have been made which allow engineers and contractors the use of conventional corrugated structural plates to design and build structures having larger spans and increased permissible live and dead loads. These structures are generally used for conditions where the depth-of-cover is limited to about 5 to 10 m and the design is constrained by a relatively low, wide-opening. However, in recent years many accidents and sudden failures have been reported on this type of structure. Such failures often originate from large soil settlements, poor soil compacting practices, and frost-thaw cycles. As a result, many different methods have been proposed to eliminate these problems. In this thesis the use of a Geogrid mesh to reinforce the soil surrounding the corrugated metal structure is proposed. It is the belief of the author that this material (Geogrid), which is widely used in the design and construction of retaining walls, will improve the strength and durability of soil-metal structures. The study carried out involved building and testing pipe-arches under shallow depth-of cover. The results obtained from these tests served to compare and document the advantage of using reinforced soil structures in contrast to non-reinforced soil structures.

40|$|<b>Corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> (CSP) {{culverts}} {{are widely}} used as an economical alternative for conveying streams and small rivers through road embankments. While passage of the design flow is generally the primary goal for culvert design, consideration must also be given to maintaining connectivity within the aquatic environment for fish and other aquatic organisms. In Canada, the design criteria for fish passage through culverts are generally specified {{in terms of a}} maximum mean flow velocity corresponding to the weakest swimming fish expected to be found at a specific location. Studies have shown, however, that the velocity distribution within a CSP culvert may provide sufficient areas of lower velocity flow near the culvert boundary to allow for fish passage, even when the mean flow velocity may exceed a fish’s swimming ability. Improved knowledge of the hydraulic conditions within CSP culverts, combined with research into fish swimming capabilities and preferences, may make it possible to better tailor culvert designs for fish passage {{while at the same time}} decreasing construction costs. To meet the requirements of regulators, various measures may be taken to reduce culvert flow velocities. Embedding, or setting the invert of a culvert below the normal stream bed elevation, is a simple and inexpensive method of increasing the flow area in a culvert flowing partially full, thereby decreasing flow velocity. Fish traversing through an embedded culvert benefit not only in terms of lower mean flow velocities, but also even lower flow velocities in the near boundary region. In the province of Saskatchewan culvert embedment is regularly used as a means to improve fish passage conditions. In this study, a laboratory scale model was used to study the velocity distribution within a non-embedded and embedded CSP culvert. An acoustic Doppler velocimeter was used to measure point velocities throughout the flow cross section at several longitudinal locations along the culvert. The hydraulic conditions were varied by changing the discharge, culvert slope and depth of embedment. The point velocity data were analyzed to determine patterns of velocity and turbulence intensity at each cross section, as well as along the length of the culvert. The results from the embedded culvert tests were compared with the results from the equivalent non-embedded tests, so that initial conclusions could be made regarding the use of embedment to improve conditions for fish passage. Analysis of the cross section velocity distributions showed that, even the non-embedded culvert had a significant portion of the flow area with flow velocity less than the mean velocity. The results from the embedded tests confirmed that embedding the culvert reduced the flow velocity throughout each cross section, although the effect was most significant for the cross sections located greater than one culvert diameter downstream from the inlet. This variation in effectiveness of embedment at reducing flow velocities is attributed to the length of the M 1 backwater profile relative to the culvert length, and thus the differential increase in flow depth that occurred at each measurement location along the culvert. For both the non-embedded and embedded culvert the peak point magnitudes of turbulence intensity were found to be located near the culvert inlet where the flow was contracting. In terms of the cross section average turbulence intensity, in the non-embedded culvert turbulence increased with distance downstream from the inlet and was highest at the cross sections located near the culvert outlet. Embedding the culvert was found to either have no impact, or to slightly increase, the cross section average turbulence intensity near the inlet. Again, a result that is attributed to the tapering out of the M 1 backwater profile at locations near the inlet under the flow conditions tested. However, beyond eight culvert diameters downstream from the inlet, embedment did result in lower cross section average turbulence intensity when compared to the non-embedded culvert. The measured velocity profiles for the non-embedded tests were found to compare well to the theoretical log-law velocity distribution using a ks value of between 0. 012 m and 0. 022 m, or approximately one to two times the corrugation amplitude, when the datum for analysis was considered to be located at the crest of the pipe corrugation. The cross section velocity distributions for the non-embedded tests compared very well to the model proposed by Ead et al. (2000). Based on this assessment, it appears that the Ead et al. model is potentially suitable for use in predicting the amount of the cross sectional area in a non-embedded culvert with flow velocity less than the design target for culvert fish passage design purposes. Overall, the results of the study confirm that, embedding a CSP culvert may be an effective way to improve fish passage conditions in terms of both flow velocity and turbulence intensity...|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{progressing}} urbanization cause numerous environmental concerns, including the impacts on urban drainage. Such impacts were addressed {{during the last}} two decades with focus on hydraulic overloading of drainage systems and the means of overload remediation by stormwater management. However, modern urban drainage also serves to provide and protect broad environmental services chiefly by controlling stormwater quality. During the past 40 years, a sizeable investment has been made in urban drainage systems to improve stormwater quality and protect receiving water ecosystems. Such investments are at risks, because of impaired performance of stormwater quality controls {{now and in the future}} for the following reasons: (i) Hydraulic and Pollution overloading (ii) the aging of stormwater management systems and (iii) insufficient attention paid to socio-economic issues. The primary objectives of the thesis that follows is to address the above issues by examining future trends in stormwater quality and the influential factors affecting these trends. Trends in urban stormwater quality, in response to projected changes in the climate, urban catchments and their drainage systems, and environmental practices and policies, were studied by systematically describing these changes by a set of scenarios, which were then applied to several test catchments in simulations with two well-established computer models of urban drainage (US EPA SWMM and WinSLAMM). In runoff simulations, stormwater quality was described Total suspended solids (TSS) and three heavy metals, namely Cu, Pb and Zn. The assessment of uncertainties in the simulation process and potential changes in sewer pipe materials further inspired two additional studies: Potential improvements in modelling trace metal transport and control by clarifying the role of coarse sediments on road surfaces, and water quality implications of using sewer pipes made from three different materials. Simulations with up-scaled rainfall data produced changes in stormwater quality, depending on the type of storm events. Generally pollutant loads increased due to climate changes characterized by higher depths and intensities of rainfall in future scenarios. Storms with low to intermediate depths and intensities showed the highest sensitivities to climatic changes, because runoff producing areas increased with higher storm intensities (i. e., leading to contributions of pervious areas), and sufficient pollutant supplies on catchment surfaces; for high intensity events, such supplies were quickly exhausted. TSS loads exported from catchments with low imperviousness were most sensitive to climatic changes, but the magnitudes of TSS loads were low compared to those from catchments with high imperviousness. Furthermore, potential changes in catchment characteristics and drainage systems were identified to be of importance. Future scenarios combining changes in climate and socio-economic factors showed that the impacts on stormwater quality caused by climatic changes were smaller than those caused by changes in socio-economic factors. However, future urbanization impacts on stormwater quality could be controlled by incorporating modern stormwater management measures in future catchments. Simulations of such controls indicated that they were highly effective in protecting the stormwater quality. Finally it was noted that the two applied computer models produced somewhat different results and high uncertainties when assessing the future stormwater quality. This was due to their different descriptions of the underlying processes. Hence, it was desirable to examine the feasibility of improving stormwater quality modelling, particularly with respect to heavy metals. During laboratory experiments coarse particles were identified to potentially release significant amounts of heavy metals (mostly in the particulate bound phase) during runoff events. Site/runoff event specific factors (e. g., traffic intensity and street sweeping routines) and characteristics of the particles (i. e. organic content) were identified as influential factors affecting the release of heavy metals. This finding may help improve the description of pollutant transport processes in stormwater quality models. Laboratory experiments showed that various pipe materials (PVC, concrete and corrugated steel) affected the stormwater quality differently, depending on the characteristics of the stormwater used in experiments. The concrete pipe contributed to increase pH of the transported stormwater. Metal concentrations were mostly unaffected in the PVC pipe, decreased in the concrete pipe (due to particle deposition and metal adsorption to the pipe surface), and while Zn concentrations increased in the <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> due to elution, Cu and Pb concentrations were reduced (due to particle deposition in the corrugations). Since the impact of climatic changes on stormwater quality was relatively small compared to changes in socio-economic factors, future efforts to maintain or improve stormwater quality should focus on implementing pollutant abatement strategies, including implementation of well-designed and maintained stormwater treatment measures. Climate change and progressing urbanization cause numerous environmental concerns, including the impacts on urban drainage. Such impacts were addressed {{during the last two}} decades with focus on hydraulic overloading of drainage systems and the means of overload remediation by stormwater management. However, modern urban drainage is designed to accomplish much more than just reduce runoff flows and volumes; it also serves to provide and protect broad environmental services chiefly by controlling stormwater quality. During the past 40 years, a sizeable investment has been made in urban drainage systems by their modifications, or additions of new components, to improve stormwater quality and protect receiving water ecosystems. Such investments are at risks, because of impaired performance of stormwater quality controls now and in the future for the following reasons: (i) Hydraulic overloading of stormwater quality control measures resulting from up-scaled precipitation in the changing climate and increasing areas contributing runoff due to expansion of urban areas and/or intensification of urban land use, (ii) Pollution overloading caused not only by the growing inputs of pollutants from progressing urbanization, but also by an increased intensity of pollutant wash-off and transport processes, (iii) the aging of stormwater management systems, which without effective maintenance suffer from deterioration of their performance, and (iv) insufficient attention paid to socio-economic issues concerning environmental policies and practices. The primary objectives of the thesis that follows is to address the above issues by examining future trends in stormwater quality and the influential factors affecting these trends. Trends in urban stormwater quality, in response to projected changes in the climate, urban catchments and their drainage systems, and environmental practices and policies, were studied by systematically describing these changes by a set of scenarios, which were then applied to several test catchments in simulations with two well-established computer models of urban drainage. The scenarios were chosen to reflect both climate change (selected from those offered by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute) and the socio-economic factors. The test catchments were selected somewhat opportunistically from those which represented typical Swedish urban catchments and were documented by the available data. Two simulation models were used: The US EPA SWMM representing one of the most widely applied physically-based models, and the WinSLAMM, which compared to SWMM, is a pollutant source based model. In runoff simulations, stormwater quality was described by several important parameters: Total suspended solids (TSS), which are arguably the most important descriptor of stormwater quality, and three ubiquitous heavy metals, namely Cu, Pb and Zn, which reflect the pollution generated by automobile traffic. The assessment of uncertainties in the simulation process and potential changes in sewer pipe materials further inspired two additional studies: Potential improvements in modelling trace metal transport and control by clarifying the role of coarse sediments on road surfaces, and water quality implications of using sewer pipes made from three different materials. Simulations with up-scaled rainfall data produced changes in stormwater quality, depending on the type of storm events. Generally pollutant loads increased due to climate changes characterized by higher depths and intensities of rainfall in future scenarios. Storms with low to intermediate depths and intensities showed the highest sensitivities to climatic changes, because runoff producing areas increased with higher storm intensities (i. e., leading to contributions of pervious areas), and sufficient pollutant supplies on catchment surfaces; for high intensity events, such supplies were quickly exhausted. TSS loads exported from catchments with low imperviousness were most sensitive to climatic changes, but the magnitudes of TSS loads were low compared to those from catchments with high imperviousness. Furthermore, potential changes in catchment characteristics and drainage systems were identified to be of importance. Future progress of urbanization will manifest itself in two ways: expansion of urban areas (urban sprawl) and intensification of land use in the existing areas. Urban sprawl leads to the growth of urban areas and generation of more runoff. Furthermore, it also leads to increased ‘kilometres travelled’, which contributes to an increased magnitude of traffic related pollution. Future scenarios combining changes in climate and socio-economic factors showed that the impacts on stormwater quality caused by climatic changes were smaller than those caused by changes in socio-economic factors. However, future urbanization impacts on stormwater quality could be controlled by incorporating modern stormwater management measures in future catchments. Simulations of such controls indicated that they were highly effective in protecting the stormwater quality, assuming the acceptability of the required investments. Finally it was noted that the two applied computer models produced somewhat different results and high uncertainties when assessing the future stormwater quality. This was due to their different descriptions of the underlying processes. Hence, it was desirable to examine the feasibility of improving stormwater quality modelling, particularly with respect to heavy metals. For stormwater quality described by heavy metals, the wash-off/elution of metals from catchment surface sediment is important, so it was further examined in laboratory experiments. Coarse particles were identified to potentially release significant amounts of heavy metals during runoff events. The released metals were predominantly in the particulate bound phase, since coarse particles acted first as collectors of fine particles in dry weather, but released those particles during rainfall runoff. Site/runoff event specific factors (e. g., traffic intensity and street sweeping routines; energy input into sediment/water interaction) and characteristics of the particles (i. e. organic content) were identified as influential factors affecting the release of heavy metals. This finding may help improve the description of pollutant transport processes in stormwater quality models. Concerning the changes in sewer pipe materials (e. g., substituting PVC or corrugated steel pipes for concrete pipes), laboratory experiments showed that various pipe materials affected the stormwater quality differently, depending on the characteristics of the stormwater used in experiments. All three materials, and particularly concrete, contributed to increased pH of the transported stormwater. Even though metals could be potentially eluted from all the materials tested, metal concentrations were mostly unaffected in the PVC pipe, decreased in the concrete pipe (due to particle deposition and metal adsorption to the pipe surface), and while Zn concentrations increased in the <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> due to elution, Cu and Pb concentrations were reduced. These reductions were explained by the fact that pipe corrugations acted as particle traps, and metal concentrations, except for Zn, were therefore significantly reduced. However, once these traps would fill up, such pollutant removals would cease. Since the impact of climatic changes on stormwater quality was relatively small compared to changes in socio-economic factors, future efforts to maintain or improve stormwater quality should focus on implementing pollutant abatement strategies, including implementation of well-designed and maintained stormwater treatment measures.

Therefore, {{it is very important to}} grasp the ultimate strength and the ductility of spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes.</b> In this study, the finite element analysis was conducted for grasping the elasto-plastic behavior of hollow spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes.</b> Based on the analysis results, the seismic performance of hollow spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> under compressive axial force and bending moment was examined and the influences of the structural parameters on the seismic performances of the spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> plate {{shear wall}} is an {{effective}} and economical lateral load resisting system. And the thin steel plate is easy to buckle. And {{it is necessary to}} use much more thickness or ribs to prevent the buckle at out of plane direction, which is not economical or complicated to construct. A number of corrugated shear walls are analyzed by nonlinear static pushover analysis method. And failure modes, buckling, the ultimate capacity, and shear force-drift curves are studied. The results showed that the <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> plate can be designed according to the failure modes, {{in order to have a}} desirable failure mode that the <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> plate yield before buckling...|$|R

With {{the promotion of}} composite bridge with <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> webs, in particular steel-concrete composite girder bridge with <b>corrugated</b> <b>steel</b> webs, {{it is necessary to}} study the shear performance and buckling of the corrugated webs. In this research, by conducting experiment incorporated with finite element analysis, the stability of H shape beam welded with corrugated webs was tested and three failure modes were observed. Structural data including load-deflection, load-strain, and shear capacity of tested beam specimens were collected and compared with FEM analytical results by ANSYS software. The effects of web thickness, corrugation, and stiffening on shear capacity of corrugated webs were further discussed...|$|R

40|$|A newly {{developed}} vertical <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> damper is introduced {{to improve the}} seismic performance of steel moment frames. The damper exhibits large lateral stiffness and excellent capability to dissipate energy due to earthquakes. It provides a reliable, compact, inexpensive, and replaceable damper. Improved performance of the structure is verified analitically using a four-story steel moment frame equipped with <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> dampers. Vertical <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> dampers are placed between any two points where large relative motion exists during earthquake excitation. A nonlinear dynamic analysis of the structure using PERFORM- 3 D software demonstrated the significant benefit of equipping the structure with <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> dampers. All structural components, except the <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> dampers, remain elastic during earthquake excitation. Structures properly designed with vertical <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> dampers will only require minimum post-earthquake inspection and limited damage. Some practical issues associated with the application of vertical <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> dampers to building structure for seismic response reduction are presented in this paper...|$|R
