40|$|Modification of a {{high energy}} {{particle}} distribution by a spectrum <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>amplitude</b> modes is investigated using a guiding center code. Only through resonance are modes effective in modifying the distribution. Diagnostics are used to illustrate the mode-particle interaction and to find which effects are relevant in producing significant resonance, including kinetic Poincare plots and plots showing those orbits with time averaged mode-particle energy transfer. Effects of pitch angle scattering and drag are studied, as well as plasma rotation and time dependence of the equilibrium and mode frequencies. A specific example of changes observed in a DIII-D deuterium beam distribution in the presence <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>amplitude</b> experimentally validated Toroidal Alfven (TAE) eigenmodes and Reversed Shear Alfven (RSAE) eigenmodes is examined in detail.

The biological effects <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>amplitude,</b> broad frequency strain are poorly understood. To evaluate the effects <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>amplitude</b> strains ranging in frequency from 0 to 50 Hz on osteoblastic function, we seeded MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells into collagen gels and applied the following loading protocols for 3 min {{per day for}} either 3 or 7 days: (1) sinusoidal strain at 3 Hz, with 0 - 3000 microstrain peak-to-peak followed by 0. 33 s resting time, (2) "broad frequency vibration" <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>amplitude</b> strain (standard deviation of 300 microstrain) including frequency components from 0 to 50 Hz, and (3) sinusoidal strain combined with broad frequency vibration (S + V). The cells were harvested on day 4 or 8. We found that the S + V stimulation significantly repressed cell proliferation by day 8. Osteocalcin mRNA was up-regulated 2. 6 -fold after 7 days of S + V stimulation, and MMP- 9 mRNA was elevated 1. 3 -fold after 3 days of vibration alone. Sinusoidal stimulation alone {{did not affect the}} cell responses. No differences due to loading were observed in alkaline phosphatase activity and in mRNA levels of type I collagen, osteopontin, connexin 43, MMPs- 1 A, - 3, - 13.
