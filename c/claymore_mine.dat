500|$|After {{failing to}} escape, the {{invasion}} of France proves a colossal failure for the UDF. [...] During the battle, Cage uses a <b>Claymore</b> <b>mine</b> to kill an unusually large blue Mimic, and dies as its blood dissolves him. He wakes up and finds himself back at Heathrow the previous morning. No one believes his story that the invasion is doomed. Cage repeats the loop of dying {{on the beach and}} waking at Heathrow over and over again, becoming more skilled in combat and learning to predict events that have yet to happen. During a time loop, he unsuccessfully attempts to save the famous Sergeant Rita Vrataski, who eventually learns he can loop time. She orders him to locate her when he [...] "wakes up", before they both perish in an explosion.|$|E
500|$|In response, George {{ordered the}} 1st Platoon to {{reinforce}} their ambush position. While {{that was happening}} Alpha Company's right flank, which was covered by the 2nd Platoon, began to receive sporadic enemy fire. The rest of the 1st Platoon was then pinned down when the Viet Cong, from within concealed bunker positions, fired on them using captured M60 machine-guns. The Viet Cong steadily increased their fire which {{came in the form}} of various small arms, [...]50 caliber and 12.7mm machine guns. Unable to communicate with the 1st and 2nd Platoons, George moved forward with the 3rd Platoon only to find his lead platoons held in their positions by enemy fire. A M18 <b>Claymore</b> <b>mine</b> then exploded in front of Alpha Company's command element, killing the radio operator and severely wounding both George and his Forward Artillery Observer. At around 10:40am gunfire had died down, but Alpha Company was virtually destroyed during 30 minutes of fighting, with the company commander wounded and the leaders of 1st and 2nd Platoons both killed.|$|E

500|$|Ron {{particularly}} despises {{talking to}} members of the public, which is why he deliberately designed his office to be uninviting to visitors, in part by mounting a double-barreled, sawed-off shotgun on a swivel atop his desk aimed at the guest chair, so it will be pointed at anyone who wants to speak to him, a <b>claymore</b> <b>mine</b> (front-pointed toward enemy), and a Czech hedgehog. Despite his lack of interest in the job, Ron occasionally demonstrates he is a good manager who recognizes the abilities of his co-workers. He claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him, and that his best friend was a co-worker he knew for three years without ever learning his name. However, Ron cares more about his colleagues than he lets on and often helps them in spite of himself. Despite sharing a nearly opposite view on the role of government, Ron gets along well with Knope, and the two share a strong mutual respect. Although Leslie had considered a job offer in the neighboring town of Eagleton, she stays based on advice from Ron that, no matter how many job offers she gets, Pawnee will always be her hometown. Ron also developed a grudging, avuncular affection for April's husband, Andy Dwyer, and decided to give him the [...] "Ron Swanson Scholarship" [...] ($940) so Andy can attend one college course: Women's Studies, after Andy and April couldn't afford to pay it. In the voiceover while Ron drops Andy off for his first day of class, he recalls his own first day of college when his father dropped him off at the steel mill. His father thought he shouldn't bother with college, but Ron hitched a ride to the school and went anyway.|$|E

Flying-in to AO Warragul in order to more effectively prevent communist interdiction of Route 15, the battalion established FSB Wattle, a position which had {{been used by the}} Australians previously during Operation Hawkesbury in September. This move proved unsuccessful however, with the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong nowhere to be found. That morning in AO Wondai, 1 Platoon A Company 1 RAR was watching the northern bank of Suoi Cau Moi and at 07:45 they contacted three Viet Cong as they attempted to cross the creek, killing one. Thirty minutes later 7 Platoon, C Company had been engaged by two Viet Cong while moving into a new ambush location. In response the Australians swept the area, and were subsequently contacted by 10 to 15 Viet Cong in a bunker system with small arms, RPG-2s and a <b>claymore</b> <b>mine,</b> resulting in one killed and five wounded, including the platoon commander, Lieutenant Bob Convery. More than [...] away, Honner moved quickly to bring the remainder of C Company to the aid of the platoon in contact. Meanwhile, 7 Platoon had pulled back from the bunkers moving their casualties to a position where they could be winched up through the canopy for Dustoff. The casualty evacuation was complete by 11:00, while Convery had continued to co-ordinate fire support for his platoon despite his wounds. By the time C Company arrived the battle was over, however following preparation by artillery the Australians assaulted the camp, only to find that the Viet Cong had withdrawn; it was destroyed the next day. That afternoon Australian cavalry from 1 Troop occupied an ambush site [...] south-west of FSB Julia, near one of the tributaries of the Rung Sat. At 17:20 the ambush was sprung, killing one Viet Cong and capturing a quantity of rice after sinking a sampan.|$|E
