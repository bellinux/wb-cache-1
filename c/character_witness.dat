5|$|On 10 November 1718, Bonnet {{was brought}} to trial before Sir Nicholas Trott, sitting in his {{capacity}} as Vice-Admiralty judge. Trott had already sat in judgment on Bonnet's crew and sentenced most of them to hang. Bonnet was formally charged with only two acts of piracy, against the Francis and the Fortune, whose commanders were on hand to testify against Bonnet in person. Ignatius Pell had turned King's evidence in the trial of Bonnet's crew and now testified, somewhat reluctantly, against Bonnet himself. Bonnet pleaded not guilty and conducted his own defence without assistance of counsel, cross-examining the witnesses to little avail, and calling a <b>character</b> <b>witness</b> in his favour. Trott rendered a damning summation of the evidence, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Two days later, after treating the convicted man to a stern lecture on his violation of Christian duties, Trott sentenced Bonnet to death.|$|E

He received an interdiction to publish and was entirely marginalized in society, turning to ghostwriting for more politically suitable scholars.|$|E
500|$|He {{was finally}} tried in 1951 {{represented}} by {{civil rights attorney}} Vito Marcantonio. The case was dismissed before the jury rendered a verdict {{as soon as the}} defense attorney told the judge that [...] "Dr. Albert Einstein has offered to appear as <b>character</b> <b>witness</b> for Dr. Du Bois". Du Bois's memoir of the trial is In Battle for Peace. Even though Du Bois was not convicted, the government confiscated Du Bois's passport and withheld it for eight years.|$|E
500|$|Einstein was a passionate, {{committed}} antiracist {{and joined}} National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned {{for the civil}} rights of African Americans. He considered racism America's [...] "worst disease," [...] seeing it as [...] "handed down {{from one generation to the}} next". As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951. When Einstein offered to be a <b>character</b> <b>witness</b> for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.|$|E

As a young attorney Cotillo had to distance himself from the local underworld that incorporated many members of the Camorra from Naples who tried to impose their [...] "services". When the so-called King of Little Italy, the Camorra boss Giosue Gallucci, was arrested for carrying concealed weapons, Cotillo was asked to testify as a <b>character</b> <b>witness</b> on his behalf, but refused. Cotillo felt that Gallucci looked at others as if they [...] "were either hirelings or payers of tribute." [...] According to Cotillo [...] "it was a matter of concern in the neighborhood if you were looked down upon by Gallucci." [...] Despite the temptation of attractive fees, he refused to help men of Gallucci's disposition to secure gun permits.|$|E

He has to be euthanised, is cremated, and has his ashes scattered on the local allotment.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} island, Kate is famous {{as one of}} the Oceanic Six. [...] She is tried for her {{numerous}} crimes committed before the crash and pleads not guilty. [...] Because Kate is opposed to bringing her son into the trial, Jack is called in as a <b>character</b> <b>witness.</b> [...] He lies in his testimony, saying that Flight 815 crashed in the water, eight survived the crash, but two have since died and Kate was primarily responsible for the Oceanic Six's survival. [...] Kate speaks with her mother Diane Janssen (Beth Broderick) {{for the first time in}} four years. [...] Diane is no longer angry at Kate because her perspective changed when she thought that Kate had died in the plane crash. [...] When Diane, the prosecution's star witness, no longer wants to testify against her daughter, the District Attorney makes a plea deal: Kate gets ten years probation, but must stay in the state of California. [...] Jack meets Kate in the parking garage. He admits that he still loves her (in contrast to his false testimony under oath on her behalf) and asks to go out for coffee with her. [...] Kate responds that they cannot go out until he is willing to visit her baby. [...] It is then revealed that Kate is raising Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) son Aaron (William Blanchette) as her own.|$|E

50|$|A story {{written in}} the first person can be told by the main character, a less {{important}} <b>character</b> <b>witnessing</b> events, or a person retelling a story they were told by someone else. This point of view is often effective in giving a sense of closeness to the character.|$|R

At his April 1975 trial, he called as <b>character</b> <b>witnesses</b> former First Ladies Jacqueline Kennedy, Lady Bird Johnson, Texas Senator Barbara Jordan (the first female, black state senator in Texas history), Dean Rusk, Robert McNamara, and Billy Graham. According to a November 1979 profile by Paul Burka in Texas Monthly magazine, [...] "The case turned first on whether Connally would simultaneously {{be tried for}} perjury—some embarrassing inconsistencies had crept into his pretrial testimony—but his lawyer was able to prevent it, and then the issue came down to whether John Connally or Jake Jacobsen was telling the truth." [...] On {{the strength of the}} defense's prominent <b>character</b> <b>witnesses,</b> Connally was acquitted.|$|R

2500|$|Manning Marable of Columbia University {{wrote in}} 1998 that LaRouche {{tried in the}} mid-1980s to build bridges to the black {{community}}. Marable argued {{that most of the}} community was not fooled, and quoted the A. Philip Randolph Institute, an organization for African-American trade unionists, declaring that [...] "LaRouche appeals to fear, hatred and ignorance. He seeks to exploit and exacerbate the anxieties and frustrations of Americans by offering an array of scapegoats and enemies: Jews, Zionists, international bankers, blacks, labor unions—much the way Hitler did in Germany." [...] During LaRouche's slander suit against NBC in 1984, Roy Innis, leader of the Congress of Racial Equality, took the stand for LaRouche as a <b>character</b> <b>witness,</b> stating under oath that LaRouche's views on racism were [...] "consistent with his own."

2500|$|On June 2, 1949, Stevenson privately gave a sworn {{deposition}} as a <b>character</b> <b>witness</b> for Alger Hiss, {{a former}} State Department official who was later {{found to be}} a spy for the Soviet Union. Stevenson had infrequently worked with Hiss, first in the legal division of the AAA in 1933, and then in 1945, 1946, and 1947 on various United Nations projects, but he was not a close friend or associate of him. In the deposition, Stevenson testified that the reputation of Hiss for integrity, loyalty, and veracity was good. In 1950 Hiss was found guilty of perjury on the spying charges. Stevenson's deposition, according to his biographer Porter McKeever, would later be used in the 1952 presidential campaign by Senators Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon to [...] "inflame public opinion and attack Adlai as 'soft on communism'." [...] In the 1952 campaign, Senator Nixon would claim that Stevenson's [...] "defense of Hiss" [...] reflected such [...] "poor judgment" [...] on his part that [...] "doubt was cast about Adlai's capacity to govern." [...] In a 1952 appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Stevenson responded to a question about his deposition for Hiss by saying [...] "I'm a lawyer. I {{think that one of the}} most fundamental responsibilities...particularly of lawyers, is to give testimony in a court of law, to give it honestly and willingly, and it will be a very unhappy day for Anglo-Saxon justice when a man, even in public life, is too timid to state what he knows and what he has heard about a defendant in a criminal trial for fear that defendant might later be convicted. That would to me be the ultimate timidity." ...|$|E
