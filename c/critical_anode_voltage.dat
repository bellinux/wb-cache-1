5000|$|The anode {{characteristic}} of a screen-grid valve is thus quite unlike that of a triode. It includes a range of <b>anode</b> <b>voltages,</b> where the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> is {{less than that of}} the screen grid, {{in which there is a}} distinctive negative resistance characteristic, sometimes called [...] "tetrode kink". This is usually undesirable, although it can be exploited as in the dynatron oscillator (Eastman, p 431). The approximately constant-current region of low slope at high <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> is also a distinctive characteristic of the tetrode. This is highly desirable, since it corresponds to a high source resistance in the anode circuit, and greatly enhances the voltage gain which the device can produce. Early screen-grid valves had amplification factors (i.e. the product of transconductance and anode slope resistance) ten times that of comparable small-signal triodes. [...] The high anode resistance (i.e. low slope) in the normal operating range is a consequence of the electrostatic shielding action of the screen grid, since it prevents the electric field due to the anode from penetrating to the control grid region, where it might otherwise influence the passage of electrons, increasing the electron current when the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> is high, reducing it when low.In practice the negative-resistance kink of the {{anode characteristic}} limits the usefulness of the screen-grid valve to applications where only small signals are amplified, so that the variations in <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> are also correspondingly small, and the operating conditions never depart from the region of high positive impedance (low positive slope) at large <b>anode</b> <b>voltage.</b> The secondary emission can be prevented from contributing to the screen current (and thus detracting from the anode current) by adding a suppressor grid, making a pentode, or beam plates to make a beam tetrode/kinkless tetrode, which can be used in power amplifiers where the variations of <b>anode</b> <b>voltage,</b> due to the presence of a large signal voltage, are much greater. The anode characteristics of these tubes are very similar to pentodes. In both cases the anode current rises rapidly to an approximately constant value when the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> rises to as little as a few tens of volts, and the region of high positive anode resistance (low slope) extends from this low value up to the maximum <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> which could be several hundred volts or more.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: At certain {{values of}} plate voltage and current, the tetrode {{characteristic}} curves are kinked due to secondary emission from the anode. In {{the normal range}} of <b>anode</b> <b>voltages,</b> the <b>anode</b> current is substantially constant with respect to <b>anode</b> <b>voltage.</b> Both features are quite unlike the corresponding curves for a triode, for which anode current increases continuously with increasing slope throughout.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reason for}} the limited {{applicability}} of the screen-grid valve, and its rapid replacement by the RF pentode (introduced around 1930) was the peculiar anode characteristic (i.e. variation of anode current with respect to <b>anode</b> <b>voltage)</b> of the former type of tube.In normal applications, the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> was about 150V, while that of the screen-grid was about 60V (Thrower p 183). [...] As the screen grid is positive {{with respect to the}} cathode, it collects a certain fraction (perhaps a quarter) of the electrons which would otherwise pass from the grid region to the anode. This causes current to flow in the screen grid circuit. Usually, the screen current due to this cause is small, and of little interest. However, if the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> should be below that of the screen, the screen grid can also collect secondary electrons ejected from the anode by the impact of the energetic primary electrons. Both effects tend to reduce the anode current. If the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> is increased from a low value, with the screen grid at its normal operating voltage (60V, say) the anode current initially increases rapidly because more of those electrons which pass through the screen-grid are collected by the anode rather than passing back to the screen grid. This part of the tetrode anode characteristic resembles the corresponding part of that of a triode or pentode. However, when the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> is increased further, the electrons arriving at the anode have sufficient energy to cause copious secondary emission, and many of these secondary electrons will be captured by the screen, which is at a higher positive <b>voltage</b> than the <b>anode.</b> This causes the anode current to fall rather than increase when the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> is increased. In some cases the anode current can actually become negative (current flows out of the anode); this is possible since each primary electron may produce more than one secondary. Falling positive anode current accompanied by rising <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> gives the <b>anode</b> characteristic a region of negative slope, and this corresponds to a negative resistance which can cause instability in certain circuits. In a higher range of <b>anode</b> <b>voltage,</b> the <b>anode</b> <b>voltage</b> sufficiently exceeds that of the screen for an increasing proportion of the secondary electrons to be attracted back to the anode, so the anode current increases once more, and the slope of the anode characteristic becomes positive again. In a yet higher range of <b>anode</b> <b>voltages,</b> the <b>anode</b> current becomes substantially constant, since all of the secondary electrons now return to the anode, and the main control of current through the tube is the voltage of the control grid. This is the normal operating mode of the tube.|$|R

5000|$|The tube was {{originally}} designed for mobile operations, so it's filament draws only 0.705 A of current, while anode power dissipation allowed {{is up to}} 40w, quite big for such low filament power.
