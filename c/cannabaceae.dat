25|$|Cannabis sativa is {{an annual}} {{herbaceous}} flowering plant indigenous to eastern Asia but now of cosmopolitan distribution due to cultivation. It {{is placed in}} the Cannabis genus which belongs to a small but diverse family the <b>Cannabaceae.</b> It has been cultivated throughout recorded history, used as a source of industrial fibre, seed oil, food, recreation, religious and spiritual moods and medicine. Each part of the plant is harvested differently, depending on the purpose of its use. The species was first classified by Carl Linnaeus in 1753.|$|E
50|$|The genus Cannabis was {{formerly}} {{placed in the}} Nettle (Urticaceae) or Mulberry (Moraceae) family, and later, along with the Humulus genus (hops), in a separate family, the Hemp family (<b>Cannabaceae</b> sensu stricto). Recent phylogenetic studies based on cpDNA restriction site analysis and gene sequencing strongly suggest that the <b>Cannabaceae</b> sensu stricto arose from within the former Celtidaceae family, and that the two families should be merged to form a single monophyletic family, the <b>Cannabaceae</b> sensu lato.|$|E

5000|$|The Rose Motif is a {{collection}} of plant characteristics utilized for diagnosing plant families in Dr. J. Richard Abbott's field botany course at Murray State University's Hancock Biological Station. These characteristics primarily identify the Rosaceae family and then with the addition of other characteristics can be used to identify Betulaceae, <b>Cannabaceae,</b> Fagaceae, and Ulmaceae. [...] This approach is not meant to be comprehensive nor exhaustive, but is focused on vegetative features, especially for common plants in eastern North America. Rosaceae mostly have relatively showy, perfect flowers with a hypanthium and are often herbaceous, whereas the other families have relatively inconspicuous, unisexual flowers without an obvious hypanthium and are all woody (except for Cannabis & Humulus in the <b>Cannabaceae).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Cannabaceae</b> is a {{small family}} of {{flowering}} plants. As now circumscribed, the family includes about 170 species grouped in about 11 genera, including Cannabis (hemp, marijuana), Humulus (hops) and Celtis (hackberries).

He also {{made significant contributions}} to the [...] "Index Kewensis" [...] (first supplement, 1901-1906). Some plants with the specific epithet of durandii commemorate his name, an example being Celtis durandii (family <b>Cannabaceae).</b>|$|E
50|$|Humulus lupulus (common hop or hop) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the <b>Cannabaceae</b> family, native to Europe, western Asia and North America. It is a dioecious, perennial, herbaceous climbing plant which sends up new shoots in early spring and dies back to a cold-hardy rhizome in autumn.|$|E
50|$|The laticiferous {{system is}} present {{in all parts of}} the mature plant, {{including}} roots, stems, leaves, and sometimes the fruits. It is particularly noticeable in the cortical tissues. Latex is usually exuded as a white liquid, but is some cases it can be clear, yellow or red, as in <b>Cannabaceae.</b>|$|E
50|$|Formerly {{included}} within the now defunct order Urticales, recent molecular studies {{have resulted in}} its placement within Rosales in a clade called the urticalean rosids that also includes Ulmaceae, Celtidaceae, <b>Cannabaceae</b> and Urticaceae. Cecropia, which has variously been placed in Moraceae, Urticaceae, or their own family, Cecropiaceae, is now included in Urticaceae.|$|E
50|$|Cuscuta europaea, {{the greater}} dodder or European dodder, is a {{parasitic}} plant native to Europe, which {{belongs to the}} family Convolvulaceae, but was formerly classified in the family Cuscutaceae. It grows on Asteraceae, <b>Cannabaceae,</b> Chenopodiaceae, Fabaceae, Urticaceae and other herbaceous plants, including garden plants such as Coleus and Impatiens. It is a notable parasite of lucerne (Medicago sativa).|$|E
50|$|Humulus, hop, {{is a small}} genus of {{flowering}} plants in the family <b>Cannabaceae.</b> The hop is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Hops are the female flowers (seed cones, strobiles) of the hop species H. lupulus; as a main flavor ingredient in beer, H. lupulus is widely cultivated {{for use by the}} brewing industry.|$|E
50|$|Aphananthe {{is a small}} genus of {{evergreen}} {{trees in}} the family <b>Cannabaceae.</b> Around six species are recognised, found in Madagascar, South-east Asia, Mexico and Australia. Leaves are alternate on the stem and toothed. Flowers are unisexual, fruit form as drupes. The generic name of Aphananthe refers to insignificant flowers. Species include Aphananthe aspera and Aphananthe philippinensis.|$|E
50|$|In the APG III system (2009), {{the plants}} {{belonging}} to this order, along {{with four other}} families, constitute the order Rosales. Cecropiaceae is no longer recognized as separate from Urticaceae. The families Ulmaceae, <b>Cannabaceae,</b> Moraceae, and Urticaceae form a clade that has strong statistical support in phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences. This clade has been informally called the urticalean rosids.|$|E
50|$|Trema lamarckiana, the Lamarck's trema or West Indian nettle tree, is {{a species}} of a plant in the <b>Cannabaceae</b> family {{belonging}} to a genus of Treme Lour.

5000|$|Aphananthe philippinensis is {{a common}} {{rainforest}} tree in the <b>Cannabaceae</b> family. In Australia it occurs from the Manning River in New South Wales to near Herberton in tropical Queensland. It was first described from the island of Luzon in the Philippines, hence the species name. The generic name of Aphananthe refers to insignificant flowers. This plant also occurs on the Solomon Islands and in Papua New Guinea ...|$|E
5000|$|Cannabis (...) is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} family <b>Cannabaceae.</b> The number of species within the genus is disputed. Three species may be recognized, Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis; C. ruderalis may be included within C. sativa; or all three may be treated as subspecies of a single species, C. sativa. [...] The genus is indigenous to central Asia and the Indian subcontinent.|$|E
50|$|Urticalean {{families}} span a {{wide range}} of morphological features—deciduous or evergreen trees, vines, shrubs, annuals and some succulents. Leaves also vary though they tend to share brochidodromous or palmately pinnate venation, often associated with lobing or compounding in the leaf blade. Among Moraceae, Urticacae and Cecropiaceae, mucilage cells and latex production is common. However, <b>Cannabaceae,</b> Ulmaceae, and Celitdaceae do not produce this material despite the presence of laticifers.|$|E
50|$|Celtis mildbraedii is {{a species}} of forest tree in the <b>Cannabaceae</b> family. This species was {{previously}} assigned to the Ulmaceae family. These trees grow in limited areas of South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. They are also found in forested areas from West Africa to Sudan, DRC, Angola and Tanzania. Common names include natal white stinkwood, red-fruited white-stinkwood and natal elm. This species {{is more common in}} Tropical Africa than in Southern Africa.|$|E
