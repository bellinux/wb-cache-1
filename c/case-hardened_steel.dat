Europe adopted Krupp plate within five years, and only the United States persisted in using Harvey steel into the 20th century. The improving quality of armour plate meant that new ships could have better protection from a thinner and lighter armour belt; 12inches (305mm) of compound armour provided the same protection as just 7.5inches (190mm) of Harvey or 5.75inches (133mm) of Krupp.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{method to}} image near-surface {{hardness}} profiles of heat-treated <b>case-hardened</b> <b>steels</b> using laser infrared photothermal radiometric phase imaging is described. It is shown that thermophysical and mechanical transverse inhomogeneity profiles in industrial {{case hardened steel}} samples are well correlated. Phase surface scanning imaging leads to a practical criterion for assessing transverse hardness homogeneity. A simple method based on phase imaging is proposed as a quantitative criterion to determine which steel samples should be rejected for thermal-wave depth-profilometric reconstruction of thermal diffusivity. Having developed this lateral hardness homogeneity criterion, we selected laterally homogeneous <b>case-hardened</b> industrial <b>steels</b> for thermal-wave frequency scans in order to perform depth profilometry of their thermal diffusivity. The reconstructed thermal diffusivity depth profiles from the samples were compared {{to the results of}} microhardness testing after each step of heat treatment: carbonitriding and quenching. The comparison showed that there is a good to excellent anti-correlation between hardness and thermal diffusivity profiles for both carbonitrided and quenched samples with 0. 02 ” case depth and gradually worsening anti-correlation trends for 0. 04 ” and 0. 06 ” case depths.

40|$|In {{the first}} phase of the REML project, major assets were {{acquired}} for a manufacturing line for follow-on installation, capability studies and optimization. That activity has been documented in the DE-FC 36 - 99 ID 13819 final report. In this the second phase of the REML project, most of the major assets have been installed in a manufacturing line arrangement featuring a green cell, a thermal treatment cell and a finishing cell. Most of the secondary and support assets have been acquired and installed. Assets have been integrated with a commercial, machine-tending gantry robot in the thermal treatment cell and with a low-mass, high-speed gantry robot in the finish cell. Capabilities for masterless gauging of product’s dimensional and form characteristics were advanced. Trial production runs across the entire REML line have been undertaken. Discrete event simulation modeling has aided in line balancing and reduction of flow time. Energy, productivity and cost, and environmental comparisons to baselines have been made. Energy The REML line in its current state of development has been measured to be about 22 % (338, 000 kVA-hrs) less energy intensive than the baseline conventional low volume line assuming equivalent annual production volume of approximately 51, 000 races. The reduction in energy consumption is largely attributable to the energy reduction in the REML thermal treatment cell where the heating devices are energized on demand and are appropriately sized to the heating load of a near single piece flow line. If additional steps such as power factor correction and use of high-efficiency motors were implemented to further reduce energy consumption, it is estimated, but not yet demonstrated, that the REML line would be about 30 % less energy intensive than the baseline conventional low volume line assuming equivalent annual production volume. Productivity The capital cost of an REML line would be roughly equivalent to the capital cost of a new conventional line. The unit raw material cost for REML (through-hardened bearing steel) is somewhat greater than raw material cost for the conventional line (<b>case-hardened</b> bearing <b>steel).</b> However, changeover time, tooling costs, gauging costs, utilities and energy costs, and manning of REML are less than the conventional line. Since REML supports near single piece flow, work in process inventory and work flow time are much less on the REML line than on the conventional line. REML allows the reduction in inventory of source steel tube sizes from several hundred to a few dozen. As a result, the business model indicates that the costs incurred on the manufacturing line are less with the REML line than with the conventional line for low manufacturing run volumes. Environment The REML line, when processing through-hardenable steel, requires far less hydrocarbon and other process gases than the conventional line when processing case hardenable steel. The REML line produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions and less liquid and solid waste materials. Broad Applicability The REML benefits will in general be extendible to the manufacture of non-bearing, heat treated and finished machined metal parts in the United States...|$|R

50|$|The armored cruisers {{built in}} the mid- to late-1890s were often as large and {{expensive}} as pre-dreadnought battleships. They combined long range, high speed and an armament approaching that of battleship with enough armor to protect them against quick-firing guns, considered the most important weapons afloat at the time. Their speed was made possible due to another development, <b>case-hardened</b> <b>steel</b> armor—first Harvey armor and then crucially Krupp armor. The higher tensile strength of these armors compared to nickel steel and mild steel {{made it feasible to}} put a light yet useful armor belt on a large cruiser. They saved further weight by not requiring a heavy timber backing, as previous armor plating had, to soften and spread the force of the impact from oncoming shells; 2.5 in of teak to give a fair surface upon which to attach them was all that was needed. Moreover, this belt could also be much wider than previously, covering the center of the hull, where the ammunition and engines were located, from the main deck to five feet below the waterline. Steel bulkheads added strength to the hull, while armor as thick as the belt covered the guns and heavier protection surrounded the conning tower. With these improvements, the ships became more fully protected than was possible previously. They were also expensive to maintain at fighting strength as they required a greater number of stokers to feed the boilers than a battleship when steaming at flank speed.|$|E
5000|$|The Pocket Model revolvers {{all have}} a {{traditional}} [...] "Colt-style" [...] frame, generally with brass grip straps and trigger guard, and a <b>case-hardened</b> <b>steel</b> frame.

Since they appear so similar to the larger weapons, without an object nearby to give them scale, the Pocket Revolvers tend to give an impression of being larger than they actually are; it is difficult to fit all four fingers onto the slender grip, even for a person with average-sized hands. Except for by noting the relative size of the trigger guard to the frame, it is easy for a casual observer to mistake a [...]31 caliber Model 1849 for an 1851 Navy (un-rebated frame, slab-sided webbing around a regular pivoting loading lever, octagonal barrel, unfluted cylinder); indeed, the Model 1851 Navy was basically no more than a scaled -up 1849 Pocket Model. Likewise, the larger [...]36 caliber Pocket Police Models are virtually identical to the 1860 Army Model, with rebated frame and stepped cylinder (to accommodate a size up from [...]31 to [...]36, instead of [...]36 to [...]44 as with the Army Model), a graceful, flowing webbing surrounding a new style [...] "creeping" [...] loading lever, and a round barrel. The most obvious difference is that the Pocket Police had a fluted 5-shot cylinder, while most Army Models were unfluted, and held six shots. The reason for this close similarity is that all four guns were closely related, and followed similar paths of development; the original [...]31 caliber Model 1849 was scaled up to create the [...]36 caliber 1851 Navy Model. Later, the Navy Model was increased in bore size by rebating the frame and enlarging the cylinder, and became the 1860 Army Model. With the success of this project, the [...]31 caliber of the 1849 Model was similarly increased to [...]36, using the same method, creating the Pocket Police and Pocket Navy models.|$|E

For example, small variations in heat-treatment conditions can lead to large differences in microstructure, and hence magnetic properties, of a steel.
