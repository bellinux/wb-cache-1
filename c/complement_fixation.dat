Positive gonorrheal <b>complement</b> <b>fixations</b> and positive Wassermann reactions in joint fluids have also been reported (1). The bactericidal activity of various body fluids has been repeatedly investigated (5, 7 to 9), but the only communication of similar studies on {{synovial fluid}} was made by Spink and Keefer (10). These authors studied the killing power for gonococci of 44 synovial fluids from 18 pa-tients with gonorrheal and from 13 patients with non-gonorrheal arthritis. Fluids which contained living gonococci and those from patients with non-gonorrheal arthritis were not bactericidal for gonococci. Sterile synovial fluids from patients with gonorrheal arthritis killed the homologous strain of gonococcus. Their bactericidal power was the same or slightly weaker {{than that of the}} blood. According to Collins (11), "the joint fluid in rheumatoid arthritis, on account of its content of polymorphs, is highly bactericidal. " Sweetapple (12) pointed out that "synovial fluid is strongly antibacterial while fresh, but excellent pabulum for bacteria when stale. " Neither author offered experimental proof for these statements. In rab-bits with experimental streptococcal arthritis, synovial fluid obtained more than 3 to 6 weeks after the infection is usually sterile (13).

25|$|Anti-double {{stranded}} DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies {{are highly}} associated with SLE. They {{are a very}} specific marker for the disease, with some studies quoting nearly 100%. Data on sensitivity ranges from 25–85%. Anti-dsDNA antibody levels, known as titres, correlate with disease activity in SLE; high levels indicate more active lupus. The presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies is also linked with lupus nephritis and there is evidence they are the cause. Some anti-dsDNA antibodies are cross reactive with other antigens found on {{the glomerular basement membrane}} (GBM) of the kidney, such as heparan sulphate, collagen IV, fibronectin and laminin. Binding to these antigens within the kidney could cause inflammation and <b>complement</b> <b>fixation,</b> resulting in kidney damage. Presence of high DNA-binding and low C3 levels have been shown to have extremely high predictive value (94%) for the diagnosis of SLE. It is also possible that the anti-dsDNA antibodies are internalised by cells when they bind membrane antigens and then are displayed on the cell surface. This could promote inflammatory responses by T-cells within the kidney. It {{is important to note that}} not all anti-dsDNA antibodies are associated with lupus nephritis and that other factors can cause this symptom in their absence.

40|$|A new cell surface protein, podoendin, {{has been}} {{identified}} in Sprague- Dawley rats, and isolated using monoclonal antibody (mAb) G 4. The distribution of podoendin is restricted {{to the surface of}} glomerular podocytes, urinary surface of the parietal epithelium of Bowman's capsule, and the luminal surface of endothelial cells. The antibody does not crossreact with podocytes or endothelia of human or mice. In newborn rats, the appearance of podoendin on glomerular epithelium is attendant on podocyte differentiation during glomerulogenesis of metanephrogenic vesicles. It disappears when podocytes retract and efface foot processes in tissue culture. Thus, podoendin appears to be a cell differentiation-dependent surface protein of podocytes. Podoendin is a protein of 62 kD mobility on 5 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It stains intensely with Coomassie blue, but gives negative reactions to carbohydrate (periodic acid/Schiff reaction) and polyanions (alcian blue, colloidal iron, and carbocyanine). It is distinct from the major sialoglycoprotein of podocyte fuzzy coat, podocalyxin (11). Podoendin isolated and purified from endothelium of lungs appears to be identical with that from podocytes and endothelium of kidneys. Injection of mAb G 4 into left ventricle of rats resulted in intense decoration of the endothelium and podocyte surface within 30 min. The decoration persisted throughout the 3 -d period of observation. This was not accompanied by <b>complement</b> (C 3) <b>fixation.</b> Preliminary results showed that the rats developed moderate proteinuria (100 mg/ml protein in urine), which was associated with the presence of hyaline droplets in renal tubules, on the third day.

40|$|We have {{attempted}} {{in the preceding}} experiments {{the beginning of an}} analysis of bacterial anaphylaxis and its relation to the occurrences in the animal body during an infectious disease. We have shown that the sensitization of the tissues of guinea pigs, as indicated by the isolated uterus, required 3 to 5 days even when passive sensitization was employed, and that in these relations conditions with bacterial sensitization were entirely analogous to those revealed for serum anaphylaxis by Dale and Weil especially. It has become apparent that the sensitized uterus reacted not at all with whole bacteria or whole red cells, or, in other words, that before reaction with sensitized organs could occur an extraction or solution of the bacterial cell must take place. That bacteria yield some of their substance to the circulating blood during the course of infection was to be expected, but it has been definitely indicated, we think, by our <b>complement</b> <b>fixations.</b> The mechanism of injury in the sensitized animal or in the human being so far along in typhoid fever that antibodies have begun to develop is in part one in which antigen, derived from the bacilli and brought into solution, or rather suspension, in the blood stream, reacts with antibodies which are from the beginning, or have subsequently become, integral parts of the cell protoplasm, the entire process taking place within the cell. This last point is indicated by the failure to sensitize by simply soaking the normal uterus in antiserum. This, however, cannot be the entire story of injury. We know that typhoid antigen injected into normal animals in moderate amounts will render them gradually sick and eventually kill them. Also, a sufficient amount injected into a normal animal will occasionally produce acute symptoms, in every respect similar to the reaction produced in sensitized animals by smaller doses. We have shown that such acute symptoms in normal animals were not due in any degree to tissue sensitiveness, since even very large quantities of antigen will produce no response {{on the part of the}} normal uterus. It is reasonable to suppose, therefore, that the injury, gradual or acute, in the normal animal, is in no respect referable to tissue sensitiveness to the whole antigen, but rather must be referred to some series of phenomena which occur in the circulation. The acute shock of normal animals may possibly, therefore, be entirely due to an intravascular reaction. Whether this is one of antigen-splitting, or of antienzyme removal in the sense of Jobling is a point on which these experiments throw no light. It is true that we have never succeeded in producing acute toxic symptoms either in the whole animal or in the isolated uterus with serum from animals acutely ill. This we eliminate as negative evidence inasmuch as we believe that the toxic substances need at no given time be present in the blood stream in sufficient concentration to render such an experiment successful. They are probably absorbed and do their injury almost as rapidly as formed, an assumption which is based on the speed with which symptoms develop. It is possible, and not to be denied on the basis of any experiment that we can devise at present, that the gradual illness of the normal animal and the occasional acute shock of these animals may be based on entirely different mechanisms. In both cases, however, in normal animals, they seem to be intravascular. And since the symptoms of acute shock which can be produced in sensitized animals with moderate doses can also, though only occasionally, be produced in normal animals with larger doses, it is reasonable to suppose that the poisons produced intracellularly in the one may be similar to those produced intravascularly in the other. It does not seem likely that the specific circulating antibodies are in any way sources of increased injury to an animal spontaneously infected with bacteria. If sufficiently powerful at the beginning they may even prevent tissue injury, first by increasing phagocytosis, then by producing intravascular agglutination, and finally, as indicated by our experiments, even by removing a part of the antigen from possible reaction with the cell, though in this last respect our experiments indicate that they functionate imperfectly. It is more probable that their chief protective action to the sensitized body lies in removing the whole bacteria from the possibility of intravascular disintegration, which, as we have shown, is prerequisite to anaphylactic injury of the tissues of the host. We would tentatively summarize our opinion as to the occurrences in the typhoid-infected body as follows: Early injury is probably due to disintegration of part of the bacteria in the course of which albumose-like bodies are liberated, and, following which, intravascular reactions result in the formation of toxic substances, perhaps by some form of proteolysis. Since the accumulation of bacteria during these stages is relatively slight, this form of injury probably plays little part in producing symptoms. Indeed, the experiment by which acute injury is produced in the normal guinea pig by the sudden injection of several times the lethal dose of partly dissolved bacteria, finds no analogy in the spontaneously diseased body. At this time the tissues are not sensitive, but as antigen absorption progresses and the tissues are stimulated to react, sensitiveness develops, which renders them much more delicately amenable to injury by direct reaction with even small amounts of dissolved but otherwise unaltered antigen. This process is directly counteracted by circulating antibodies which tend to remove the bacteria from the possibility of yielding their antigen to solution by agglutinating them, aiding phagocytosis, and to a slight extent even neutralizing dissolved antigen. It seems likely, therefore, that the symptoms which appear as the incubation time ends are largely those due to cellular sensitization which probably begins before any considerable amount of circulatory antibodies is present. The circulating antibodies would seem to have little or nothing to do with intravascular injury, the ferments responsible for this, however much it may occur, probably consisting of the non-specific proteases studied in this connection by Jobling. Finally it appears that highly sensitized animals are more easily killed by typhoid antigen than are normal animals, provided they do not dispose over unusually large amounts of circulating antibodies. Cure would consist of a gradual checking of growth and final destruction of the bacteria, and the consequent cessation of antigen liberation, but delicate hypersusceptibility would probably persist for some time after cure and immunity have been established. Just what the relation between tissue hypersusceptibility and immunity is remains a problem for further study...|$|R
40|$|The {{elimination}} of the foreign complement and corpuscles from the test for the serodiagnosis of syphilis has been attempted, and the results so far obtained are very satisfactory. Instead of using guinea pig complement, fresh human serum was utilized {{for the source of}} complement for the production of hemolysis upon the human corpuscles in the presence of an adequate amount of the specific anti-human amboceptor (prepared in rabbits). Usually 0. 1 cc. of fresh human serum contains enough complement to hemolyze 1 cc. of a 1 per cent suspension of human corpuscles, but the amount of anti-human amboceptor required in this combination is about five to seven times that necessary when guinea pig complement (0. 04 cc.) is used. It has also been shown that when a given human serum contains insufficient complement, an adequate quantity (0. 1 cc. is usually enough) of another fresh negative serum may be added to supplement it. However, one rarely encounters this group of sera. Inactivated human sera can also be examined by utilizing human complement from another source (the serum must be fresh, active, and negative). The only drawback to the present method is the comparatively large amount of anti-human hemolytic amboceptor required. It is estimated that 30 to 40 cc. of the anti-human hemolytic immune serum, from one rabbit, of high potency—say 0. 005 cc. —would be enough to examine about 3, 000 to 4, 000 cases (0. 01 cc. for each case), whereas if guinea pig complement were used the same amount would cover about 15, 000 tests (0. 002 cc. for each case). In a large hospital or in the Army there should be no difficulty in preparing any amount of the anti-human hemolytic amboceptor. For example, material for 100, 000 tests could be prepared within 1 month in less than 100 rabbits. The amboceptor serum can be used in the fluid state, or, if the titer is high, impregnated into filter papers. Special attention should be called to the fact that to obtain a powerful anti-human hemolytic amboceptor five to six intraperitoneal injections of corpuscles, thoroughly washed (until there is no trace of serum in the supernatant fluid), in doses of 5, 7, 10, 10, 10, and possibly another 10 cc. of the concentrated suspension (restored to the. original volume of the blood) are required. The bleeding may be done by the 9 th or 10 th day. The animals may be kept after bleeding for the production of more amboceptor by subsequent injections of the washed corpuscles. Finally, it should be emphasized that only the acetone-insoluble fraction of tissue lipoids of required standards (Noguchi) should be used when utilizing the human <b>complement</b> in the <b>fixation</b> test...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of protection of type-specific antipneumococcal antibody and complement in bacteremia was investigated with purified rabbit antibody and a guinea pig model of pneumococcal bacteremia. IgG and IgM were {{isolated from the}} sera of rabbits immunized with type 7 pneumococci (Pn), and their binding to Pn was quantitated. The number of antibody-binding sites on the pnuemococcal capsule was also determined. Pn were incubated with various amounts of the immunoglobulin preparations before intravenous injection into nonimmune guinea pigs. Whereas 120 molecules of IgM per Pn were sufficient to enhance bloodstream clearance of Pn, 1, 400 molecules of IgG per bacterium were required to produce this effect. As the amount of either IgG or IgM added to the Pn was increased, the rate of bloodstream clearance accelerated. In striking contrast, greater than 1, 000 molecules of IgM {{had no effect on}} the rate of clearance in C 4 -deficient guinea pigs, which cannot activate complement via the classic pathway. Similarly, 5, 000 molecules of IgG had only minimal effect in C 4 -deficient guinea pigs, and 24, 000 molecules of IgG had no effect in guinea pigs depleted of complement by cobra venom factor. Thus, the in vivo opsonic effects of both IgG and IgM anticapsular antibody are mediated via their ability to activate complement. IgG anti-pneumococcal cell wall antibody, raised by intravenous injection of rabbits with unencapsulated Pn, had no effect on the rate of bloodstream clearance of Pn or on the polymorphonuclear leukocyte killing of type 7 Pn in an in vitro bacterial assay. Because the opsonic effects of anticapsular antibody required complement activation, the ability of anticell wall IgG to activate complement was compared with the two classes of anticapsular antibody. As judged by depletion of C 3 and C 4 from guinea pig serum, {{as well as by the}} fixation of radiolabeled C 3 to Pn, IgM anticapsular antibody was the best complement activator. However, anticell wall IgG was somewhat more active than anticapsular IgG in each of these tests of <b>complement</b> activation and <b>fixation.</b> When equivalent amounts of C 3 were fixed to Pn by each of the three antibodies, Pn sensitized with IgG and IgM anticapsular antibodies caused immune adherence, whereas Pn sensitized with anticell wall IgG did not. This may explain the failure of anticell wall antibody of mediate complement-dependent phagocytosis of Pn in vivo or in vitro. Although anticell wall IgG is capable of activating complement and fixing C 3 to Pn, it is not opsonic; the most likely reason is that the nonopsonic antibody mediates C 3 deposition in sites on the Pn that cannot interact efficiently with phagocytic cell C 3 receptors...|$|R
