50|$|On {{the site}} of today's Lindenau motorbus depot, a tram depot and {{workshop}} was established in 1899. The latter had a notable characteristic: {{only one of the}} four tracks was connected to the tram network. The others were accessed by <b>transfer</b> <b>table.</b> Within a year, a power plant and an additional tramcar shed had already been built. A third tramcar shed, with <b>transfer</b> <b>table,</b> was built in 1907. Following construction of the new depots, the last tramcars working Line P were relocated to Probstheida Depot. The oldest tramcar shed was converted into a trackless workshop building. Nevertheless, in the same year, a new workshop building was opened, which tramcars could access only on <b>transfer</b> <b>tables.</b> In 1924, another workshop was established at Hinterfeld, with most of the tracks connected by a new <b>transfer</b> <b>table.</b> These complicated facilities as well as the ever-growing number of buses made a new solution urgently necessary.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design a {{proposal}} of <b>Transfer</b> <b>table</b> electromechanical earmarked for transporting packs of sheets of tin with balance-sheet of electromechanical and electrohydraulic construction and to make important technical calculations.

The work includes functional calculations, which mainly includes the design and control of power running and lifting gear, calculate speeds and lift loads, the chain drives and other assemblies Transverse. Conclusion of this work deals with the assessment of the frame strength of the <b>Transfer</b> <b>table</b> using the finite element method. Further the work deals with the assessment of the maximum capacity of the machine and with any design modifications. The work also contains a design documentation, especially the plan of the <b>Transfer</b> <b>table</b> and detailed drawings of the frame and eccentric casters...|$|R

50|$|The LESt {{opened this}} depot, {{near the town}} center, on 20 May 1896. At first it had two tramcar sheds with a {{workshop}} in between. This could be accessed only {{by means of a}} <b>transfer</b> <b>table.</b> All facilities were at first connected only to the Wittenberger Straße. A <b>transfer</b> <b>table</b> {{at the rear of the}} facility, connecting all the tramcar shed tracks, was opened on 20 August 1898. At the same time the depot was connected to the tracks in the Apelstraße, because an additional small workshop and an additional tramcar shed were built, which did not have exits to the Wittenberger Straße. An open-air storage yard was established at the corner of the Apelstraße and the Berliner Straße. This was accessible only by <b>transfer</b> <b>table.</b> Only in October 1909 was the first connecting track opened between the Apelstraße and the Wittenberger Straße.|$|R

Rubber wheels have a property of making little noise as they roll on surfaces such as plexiglass. The noiseless train will serve two purposes, transferring guests and supplying the underwater hotel. Supplies will be packed on land, and delivered efficiently to the hotel to minimize the space taken up by goods in the hotel. <b>Cars</b> <b>transferring</b> supplies will feature palettes, and <b>cars</b> <b>transferring</b> passengers will provide {{a view of the}} ocean. The guest transporting aspect of the train will have a maximum efficiency of 1000 people per hour.|$|R

50|$|The {{equipment}} is mostly {{housed in the}} former SSW shops, which was the main heavy repair and erection shop for SSW during the steam era. The shop has such heavy repair equipment as pits, massive overhead cranes, and tools for servicing large railroad equipment. On {{the east side of}} the former shops is a <b>transfer</b> <b>table</b> that is still operable. The <b>transfer</b> <b>table</b> is used to move exhibits from time to time. The best time to see the exhibits outside is the first weekend in April (unless that weekend is Easter) when the Museum has its annual show. Many of the exhibits are taken outside so that tables can be set up inside the museum for vendors.|$|R

5000|$|Turnouts are {{far more}} complex when the rack is at or {{below the level of}} the running rails. Marsh's first rack patent shows such an arrangement, and the {{original}} Mount Washington Cog Railway he built had no turnouts. It was not until 1941 that a turnout was constructed on this line. [...] There were more turnouts built for the line but all were hand operated. In 2003, a new automatic hydraulic turnout was developed and built at the base as a prototype. With the success of the new turnout, more new automatic hydraulic turnouts were built to replace the hand-operated ones. The new turnouts installed on the Mount Washington line in 2007 are essentially <b>transfer</b> <b>tables.</b> The Locher rack also requires <b>transfer</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|R

MİY could not signed with new players in Summer 2016, because TFF decided on transfer ban for MİY due to club' debt to former coach Giray Bulak and former player Joseph Boum. The UEFA transfer ban due to removal of contract wit former player David Bičík had been applied for 2015 Winter and Summer transfer seasons. later TFF did not open <b>transfer</b> <b>table</b> in 2016 Winter and 2016 Summer transfer seasons. By the way, TFF has declared a three-point deduction penalty due to financial inefficiencies on 20 September 2016. However, on 27 September 2016 it was declared by then president Çalışkan that the debts were discharged.
