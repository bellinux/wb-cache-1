40|$|The role of {{commercial}} bank lending in financing the farm production sector {{is an issue}} of growing importance. During the past several years, farm operat ors have become more capital intensive, thus requiring more loans to fund not only seasonal plantings but also capital expansion. While one area of research (Linsj Penson; Hesser 'and Schuh) has focused on the determinants of aggregate loan demand, subsequent work (Boehlje and Fisherj Boehlje, Harris and Hoskins) has concentrated on such demand in local financial markets. Despite this re search on financial market behavior, relatively little has been done to model and empirically test the decision process of individual lending officers in this market. Existing studies (i. e., Barry, Baker, and Sanint; Sonka, Dixon, and Jones). have concentrated primarily on. credit analysis of farm firms.

Following Institute of Banker’s Malaysia’s (IBBM) Certified Credit Professional Handbook, before a loan can be made, a banker must evaluate the broad risk factors in evaluating credit, and a possible general model {{that can be used to}} assess a potential borrower’s basic credit factors is known as the 7 C’s of Credit. It is important to note that all the “C’s” are important, but may be listed in the order of importance sequentially as Character, Capacity, Capital, <b>Conditions,</b> <b>Collateral,</b> Control and Common Business Sense. Here, “Conditions” have been described as macroeconomic issues like globalization, foreign currency markets, economies of major trading partners, legislative and regulatory frameworks as well as social trends. Certainly this is a wide list of issues, and while it is useful for bankers to bear these issues in mind, it may be said that such a wide list of descriptors lack focus and may even be disadvantageous due to its vague nature. In this paper, it is the search for the most relevant macroeconomic factors that should be included and considered by Malaysian bankers in “Conditions” that is being investigated in order to sharpen the list of criteria that must be considered by bankers by pin-pointing which economic indicators that can be most helpful to bankers.

The Crosssectional data from 313 randomly selected loan beneficiaries (rice growers), were obtained. The data were analyzed by using multiple regression, t-test, percentages and frequency distributions. It was concluded that factors which showed significant results in both sources banks and arties were farm size, income level, time requirement, payback period and no. of dependent schooling children. Apart from the mentioned factors which other studies have also established, more interesting factors have been identified by this study including the question of trust between Arties and borrowers built on information of borrowers on reputation obtained by Arties and also follow up by arties on borrowers’ use of credit. Here information seems to play a crucial role in building trust and therefore easing conditions for borrowing since most borrowers received their loans without any <b>collateral</b> <b>conditions.</b> Based on these results, it is suggested that banks must improve the amount of loans to agriculture sector in general and to rice growers in particular taking into account information and follow up of their clients. The lenient polices must be formulated by banks regarding collateral securities so that small scale rice growers can avail the loan facilities at lesser <b>collateral</b> <b>conditions.</b> Besides it, arties must reduce commission rate and other type of charges (per acre fixed quantity of rice).

40|$|Based on {{survey data}} {{covering}} 8, 387 firms in 20 countries we compare credit demand and credit supply for firms in Eastern Europe {{to those for}} firms in selected Western European countries. We find that, while 30 % of firms do not need credit in Eastern Europe, their need for credit is higher than in Western Europe. The firm-level determinants of credit needs in Eastern Europe are quite {{similar to that in}} Western Europe: Firms with alternative financings sources, i. e. government-owned, foreign-owned and internally financed firms, are less likely to need credit. Small firms are also less likely to demand credit than larger firms, suggesting that they may have limited investment opportunities. We find that a higher share of firms is discouraged from applying for a loan in Eastern Europe than in Western Europe. Firms in Eastern Europe seem particularly discouraged by high interest rates compared to firms in Western Europe, with <b>collateral</b> <b>conditions</b> and loan application procedures also more discouraging. The higher rate of discouraged firms in Eastern Europe is related to a stronger reluctance of small and financially opaque firms to apply for a loan compared to Western Europe. While many discouraged firms correctly anticipate that their loan applications would be rejected, a large majority of discouraged firms seem to be creditworthy. At the country-level we find that the higher rate of discouraged firms in Eastern Europe is driven more by the presence of foreign banks than by the macroeconomic environment or the lack of creditor protection. We find no evidence that foreign bank presence leads to stricter loan approval decisions. Our findings suggest to policy makers that the low incidence of bank credit among firms in Eastern Europe, compared to Western Europe, is not driven by less need for credit or banks' reluctance to extend loans. The main driver seems to be that many (creditworthy) firms are discouraged from applying for a loan, due to high interest rates, <b>collateral</b> <b>conditions</b> and cumbersome lending procedures. As discouragement is particularly high among small and opaque firms, as well as in countries with a strong presence of foreign banks, it seems that firms perceive lending standards to have become more reliant on "hard information" with the entry of foreign banks. However, as loan rejection rates are not related to foreign bank presence, it seems that firms' perceptions of the likely lending conditions may be too pessimistic. Thus more transparency about credit eligibility and conditions may improve credit access, particularly in countries with a high presence of foreign banks. Banking, Credit, Transition economies...|$|R
40|$|If a {{borrower}} defaults on a loan, a bank’s recovery {{may depend}} {{on the value of}} the loan collateral. The value of collateral, like the value of other assets, fluctuates with economic conditions. If the economy experiences a downturn, a bank can experience a double misfortune: many obligors default, and the value of collateral is damaged. Conventional credit models overlook the effect of economic <b>conditions</b> on <b>collateral.</b> They allow default to vary from year to year, but they hold fixed the average value of collateral and the average level of recovery. The distinctive feature of the credit model presented here is that an economic downturn causes damage to the value of collateral. When systematic collateral damage enters the credit model, the capital allocated to a highly collateralised loan can double or triple. 1 Taking collateral damage into account complicates a credit capital model. However, the results of the model can be well approximated by a function of expected loss alone. Expected loss can therefore be used as the basis of a credit capital estimate. This estimate is simpler, and can be more accurate than using the results of a conventional credit model that ignores the role of collateral damage. Credit capital model The credit capital model uses the conditional approach suggested by Finger (1999) and Gordy (2000). The variables in the model depend on a systematic risk factor, a random variable representing the good years and bad years of the economy. The co-variation between two variables stems from their mutual dependence on the systematic factor. Two variables that relate strongly to the systematic factor relate strongly to each other and therefore have a strong correlation. Exposure of $ 1 is assumed to each obligor j. At the end of a one-year analysis horizon, the value of collateral is a random number characterised by three positive parameters: its amount, mj; its volatility, sj; and its sensitivity to X, the systematic risk factor, also known as its “loading”, qj: Collateral = µ 1 + σ...|$|R
40|$|Formulation of {{the problem}} in this {{research}} is How lending policy applied to PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Overseas Branch, Aceh Tamiang and the influence of non-performing loans (NPL) to loan to deposit ratio (LDR). The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the credit policies were applied, and also find out if non-performing loans significantly affect the loan-to-deposit ratio. The hypothesis in this study is suspected of lending policies that are both based on the theories of credit policy with the principles 5 C, and the significant influence of the non-performing loans to the loan-to-deposit ratio. The collection of secondary data obtained through company documents and other reports relevant to this study include: financial statement data for the five years from 2007 to 2011, books, company literature, and other data related with the object of research. The analysis method used is descriptive analysis is used to analyze the credit policy on the first hypothesis and simple regression analysis for the second hypothesis. In the first hypothesis of the study results show that the principle of prudence in lending policy is the principle 5 C consisting of: Character, Capacity, Capital, <b>Collateral,</b> <b>Condition.</b> In the second hypothesis test simple regression analysis showed a significant effect of the non-performing loans to the loan-to-deposit ratio...|$|R
40|$|Transcatheter {{arterial}} embolization (TAE) {{has been}} reported as the treatment of choice for rupture of the visceral artery. We experienced two clinical cases of rupture of the right hepatic artery after left lobectomy of the liver for radical resection of the bile duct carcinoma. In the first case, TAE {{was performed on the}} right hepatic artery twice under a condition of hemorrhagic shock. Consequently, hepatic ischemia developed into complete infarction of the remnant liver tissue in spite of control of bleeding from the rupture site. In the second case, TAE was successfully accomplished because of the patient's good general <b>condition</b> and sufficient <b>collaterals</b> to the remnant liver. Bile leakage from the hepaticojejunostomy was observed early in the postoperative course, and episodes of intermittent flow of blood through the abdominal drain were experienced in both cases. Injury to the exposed arterial wall by leaking bile after lymph-node dissection was considered to be a possible contributive factor of rupture. TAE following initial diagnostic arteriography should be performed at an early stage when there are several episodes of intraabdominal bleeding. However, hypovolemic shock from massive hemorrhage and poor arterial collaterals due to the primary surgical procedure unfavorably affected the prognosis of a patient undergoing TAE...|$|R
