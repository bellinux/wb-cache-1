50|$|Despite its {{domestic}} constitutional evolution from {{the status of}} an overseas collectivity to that of an overseas department, effectively becoming a full constituent territory within the French Republic, {{with regards to the}} European Union, Mayotte remained an 'Overseas country and territory' (OCT) in association with the Union (as per Article 355(2) TFEU) and not a constituent territory of the European Union {{in the same way as}} the other four overseas departments. However following a directive of the European Council in December 2013, Mayotte became an outermost region of the European Union on 1 January 2014. This successful agreement between the 27 member states follows a petition made by the French government for Mayotte to become an integral territory of the European Union nonetheless benefiting from the derogation clause applicable in existing Outermost regions, namely Article 349 TFEU, as favoured in a June 2012 European <b>Commission</b> <b>opinion</b> on Mayotte's European constitutional status.|$|E
5000|$|On April 7, 2016 Croatia {{refused to}} endorse the EU <b>Commission</b> <b>opinion</b> to open Chapter 23, a part of Serbia’s EU {{accession}} negotiations, thus effectively blocking Serbia’ EU integration process. Serbia accused Croatia of obstructing its EU membership, and Vučić said that his government was: [...] "Stunned by Croatia's decision not to support Serbia's European path."Croatia has not agreed for Serbia to open negotiations of Chapter 23. On April 14, 2016, the EU Commission rejected Croatian arguments in its dispute with Serbia. However, on July 7, 2016, Croatian Foreign Minister Miro Kovač announced that five conditions set by Croatia have been incorporated in the common position of the EU member states for negotiations with Serbia {{which will be the}} basis on which Serbia's progress in Chapter 23, concerning the judiciary and fundamental rights, will be assessed. These five conditions are: Serbia has to: 1. steer clear of conflicts of jurisdiction concerning war crimes, 2. cooperate with neighboring countries in search and identification of missing persons or their remains, 3. strengthen its investigative, prosecution, and judicial authorities, 4. strengthen protection of (Croatian) minority, and 5. fully cooperate with the ICTY.|$|E

Our empirical findings support {{the existence of}} a high recovery episode for inventory investment, during the quarters immediately following the recessions: it occurs later and lasts longer in manufacturing than in retail trade sector. Since a third phase of rapid recovery has not been found in final sales data so far, the rebound in inventories could in turn explain the GDP growth bounce-back pointed out in previous empirical studies. This calls for a careful modeling of the inventory investment behavior in any sensible theoretical explanation of aggregate business cycles...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the contribution to transnational constitution-making of the European Commission for Democracy through Law, {{better known as the}} Venice Commission. While part of the Council of Europe, the Venice Commission is much less understood than the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), notwithstanding the existing literature. 1 This chapter therefore seeks to explicate and evaluate. It begins by explicating the organizational foundations of the Venice Commission, followed by analysis of its remit and role. The focus then shifts to triggering and working methodology. The remainder of the article is concerned with evaluation of the Commission’s role in relation to constitution-making as broadly conceived, the analysis being situated within the literature concerning transnational legal orders (TLOs). 2 There is an overview of the central elements of TLO theory, the reasons why the Venice Commission can be conceptualized within this theoretical frame, and its distinctive contribution to constitution-making. TLOs are increasingly prevalent across diverse fields, including those concerned with constitutions, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. The prevalence of TLOs renders it all the more important that they are subject to the same searching evaluation that we commonly bring to bear when analyzing national norms. To this end there is more detailed analysis of the process rights and procedure afforded to the state {{that is the subject of}} a Venice <b>Commission</b> <b>opinion,</b> and the substantive criteria and standards that the Commission considers when producing its opinions. The article concludes with discussion of implementation by the addressee of the opinion, and the broader impact of the Commission through sharing best practice and cooperation...|$|E

The Circular stated clearly that {{reform of the}} real estate tax system had to be intensified. In addition, it delegated MOF, SAT, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development to be responsible for studying the introduction of Real Estate Tax. There were concerns over government policies to control real estate prices. Investors worried about the impact of policies restricting investment in the property sector and the corresponding effect on the banking industry. Critics also said that the introduction of real estate tax would increase the cost of holding properties. The resulting reduction in demand for properties will affect the desire of property developers in building new residential and commercial buildings. This will affect not only the construction sector, but also those industries relating closing to the real estate business, including coal, steel, cement, and furniture. As a result, the demand for loans from financial institutions will decline. This would have significant negative impact on property market and on the investment atmosphere in securities market. Although in response to media enquiries on the press report, the spokesperson of the SAT replied that no information with regard to the approval was received, the share prices had reflected the bad news. Shortly after the press report on the issue of real estate tax, during the week of April 18 - 22, 2010, the Shanghai Composite Index had its biggest weekly decline in five months.

40|$|With rapid {{recovery}} from the financial crisis, real estate prices in China have increased dramatically over recent years. Increase in demand for properties in China was originally driven {{by the desire to}} improve living standards and later reinforced by the opportunities offered for investment and speculation. Speculators are looking for capital gain and many of them do not lease out the properties on hand. State Grid Corporation of China performed a survey in 660 cities and found that 65. 4 million of residential properties had not consumed any electricity in the past six months. Holding the properties will reduce the supply of residential premises in the market and thus, drive up the property prices. In order to avoid a possible bubble in the real estate market, the Chinese government reconsidered the plan discussed in the Third Plenary Session of the 16 th Central Committee of Communist Party of China (CPC) held in October 2003 to reform the tax system on properties. The plenum deliberated and approved the document titled, “The decision of the CPC Central Committee on Issues Regarding the Improvement of the Socialist Market Economic System” (the “Document”). The Document specified that reform on taxation system in urban and rural areas should be introduced. When conditions were ready, a unified tax system on immovable properties should be implemented to replace the current fees and charges on real estate transactions. Starting in 2003, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) began the pilot running of the Real Estate Tax in provinces and 32 cities and counties in three batches. The pilot running involved cooperation from different parties in the regulatory bodies to test the feasibility of implementing the tax law, but no tax had been levied. In late April 2010, the press reported that “the State Council approved the introduction of a real estate tax trial program which would be launched in Beijing, Chongqing and Shenzhen. In addition, the trial program would be extended to Shanghai after the end of World Expo at the end of October 2010. On May 19, 2009, the State Council released the “Circular on Approval and Transmission of the ‘National Development and Reform <b>Commission,</b> <b>Opinion</b> on Intensifying the Reform of the Economic System in 2009 ’” (the “Circular”).
