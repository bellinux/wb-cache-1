40|$|ABSTRACT: Scorpion venom toxins {{generally}} produce similar effects by mainly {{acting on}} sodium channels, {{and to a}} lesser extent, on potassium, calcium, and chloride channels. This leads to increased release of neurotransmitters and mediators, resulting in a cascade of pathological events, involving the central nervous system, the autonomic nervous system, the cardiovascular and the respiratory system, eventually leading to death. The objective of this paper was to discover whether a sodium channel blocker, lidocaine, or a calcium channel blocker, verapamil, would prolong the survival of mice injected with the venom from the <b>common</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>scorpion</b> Leiurus quinquestriatus quinquestriatus (LQQ). For this purpose, mice were divided into 2 groups, each injected with a different venom dose (250 or 300 �g. kg- 1, s. c.). Subgroups (n= 10) from each group were given venom alone; different doses of lidocaine (4, 10, 15, or 20 mg. kg- 1); or several doses of verapamil (0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 1, 0. 3, or 1 mg. kg- 1).

For this purpose, mice were divided into 2 groups, each injected with a different venom dose (250 or 300 ug. kg- 1, s. c.). Subgroups (n= 10) from each group were given venom alone; different doses of lidocaine (4, 10, 15, or 20 mg. kg- 1); or several doses of verapamil (0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 1, 0. 3, or 1 mg. kg- 1). All doses of lidocaine and verapamil were intravenously administered 3 minutes before, 1, 5, and 15 minutes after venom injection. Percent surviving after 24 hours was recorded in addition to the time of death. In general, lidocaine significantly prolonged survival at the dose of 10 mg. kg- 1 (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 01, versus low and high dose of venom, respectively) or 15 mg. kg- 1 (P< 0. 01 and P< 0. 001, versus low and high dose of venom, respectively; Covariance Wilcoxon survival statistics), especially when injected before the venom or {{in the early stages of}} envenomation. On the other hand, in all doses administered, verapamil was either toxic or showed non-significant results. Lidocaine, the sodium channel blocker, appears to play an important role in the protection from lethality of mice injected with LQQ venom, and significantly prolonged the survival time of mice whether injected before or in the early stages of envenomation...|$|E

5000|$|The deathstalker (Leiurus quinquestriatus) is {{a species}} of {{scorpion}}, {{a member of the}} Buthidae family. It is also known as Israeli or Palestine <b>yellow</b> <b>scorpion,</b> Omdurman scorpion, Naqab desert scorpion and many other colloquial names, which generally originate from the commercial captive trade of the animal. To eliminate confusion, especially important with potentially dangerous species, the scientific name is normally used to refer to them.

40|$|Background: Scorpionism is {{a public}} health problem in some provinces in Iran. The present study aimed to assess the {{clinical}} manifestations of scorpion envenomation in Shiraz and determine a clinical severity grading for Iranian scorpion envenomation in order to suggest a treatment guideline for emergency physicians. Methods: In this analytic retrospective study, all medical charts of patients with scorpion sting admitted in the adult medical toxicology center in Shiraz during July 2012 to July 2016 were assessed. Data regarding the patient's age, gender, sting site, month of envenomation, time of sting, clinical manifestations, vital signs, presence of blood or hemoglobin in urine analysis, duration of admission, color of scorpion, received treatments, and administration of scorpion antivenin were recorded. Results: The scorpions in Shiraz and its suburban area were classified into two groups: <b>yellow</b> <b>scorpions</b> (Mesobuthus eupeus, Mesobuthus caucasicus, and Compsobuthus matthiesseni) and Hottentotta scorpions (Hottentotta jayakari and Hottentotta zagrosensis). A total of 126 cases of scorpion stings were assessed. About 59 % (n= 74) were males. The patients aged 8 - 63 years (mean age, 33. 8 ± 11. 5 years). About 38. 4 % (n= 48) of the stings occurred during summer. More than 40 % of patients (n= 51) referred to the emergency department (ED) at night. Localized pain was the most frequent presenting complaint (76. 2 %). The most frequent general symptom was nausea (6. 3 %). The most prevalent envenomation site was the lower extremities followed by upper extremities (43. 5 % and 41. 9 %, respectively). Based on the clinical severity grading for Iranian scorpion envenomation, 65, 43, and 18 patients (51. 6 %, 34. 1 %, and 14. 3 %) were classified in the grades I, II, and III, respectively. Eighty-one (73 %) patients stayed in the ED from 1 to 6 hours, and 30 (27 %) patients stayed for > 6 hours for observation. Severe localized pain was more prevalent in stings with Hottentotta <b>scorpions</b> than <b>yellow</b> <b>scorpions</b> (P= 0. 01). The season of envenomation with Hottentotta scorpions was summer in all cases, but envenomation with <b>yellow</b> <b>scorpions</b> was seen throughout the year. All patients received symptomatic treatment, and five were given scorpion antivenin. No death was reported. Conclusion: Hottentotta jayakari is recommended to be listed among the medically important scorpions in Iran. Moreover, scorpion- stung patients in geographical regions where Hemiscorpius lepturus and Androctonus crassicauda are not prevalent may be treated in outpatient departments. The presented grading system {{can be used for}} treating patients with scorpion envenomation. © Iran University of Medical Sciences...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA new {{antimicrobial}} peptide, herein named Stigmurin, {{was selected}} based on a transcriptomic analysis of the Brazilian <b>yellow</b> <b>scorpion</b> Tityus stigmurus venom gland, an underexplored source for toxic peptides with possible biotechnological applications. Stigmurin was investigated in silico, by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and in vitro. The CD spectra suggested that this peptide interacts with membranes, changing its conformation {{in the presence of}} an amphipathic environment, with predominance of random coil and beta-sheet structures. Stigmurin exhibited antibacterial and antifungal activity, with minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 8. 7 to 69. 5 μM. It was also showed that Stigmurin is toxic against SiHa and Vero E 6 cell lines. The results suggest that Stigmurin can be considered a potential anti-infective drug...|$|R
