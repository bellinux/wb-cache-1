What may be the {{greatest}} <b>closing</b> <b>hole</b> in golf was originally an unremarkable par 4. In 1922, William Herbert Fowler added almost 200 yards to the hole.

50|$|Play resumed Monday at 10:05 a.m., {{with six}} {{players on the}} course within three shots of the lead. Headed to the 72nd hole, Phil Mickelson was tied for the lead at three under with Thomas Bjørn and Steve Elkington. Mickelson birdied the par 5 18th to win his second major title. Mickelson flopped a chip from the deep grass some 50 ft away to two feet for a birdie and a {{one-shot}} victory. Elkington and Bjorn both missed birdie putts and {{had to settle for}} par on the 554 yd <b>closing</b> <b>hole.</b> Mickelson became the seventh wire-to-wire winner (though he shared the lead after the first and third rounds) at the PGA Championship and the first since Tiger Woods in 2000. The round of the day belonged to Ted Purdy, who ended up in a tie for tenth after a final round 66.|$|E

Data from scanning is data pulses to be processed by a microcontroller, and then it is sent to the computer by serial communications and display in three dimensions. To display the form of a layer of concrete walls in three dimensions, the y-axis is assumed as the depth of well. As for the x-axis and z-axis are sought by the formula geometry obtained from the combination of TOF ultrasonic and servo angle. The expectation target is to know the shape of the surface layer of concrete from the reservoir is detected by the ultrasonic sensors.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{deals with}} {{rotating}} bending fatigue tests on aluminum alloy 6061 -T 6, under loading condition close to elastic limit of material.

It is found that the stress concentration for two <b>close</b> pitting <b>holes</b> is an exponential function of the separation between the two holes, under uniaxial loading. The probability to find two or more <b>close</b> pitting <b>holes</b> in real industrial materials, such as cast iron, corroded or pitting metallic alloys is high; then, the stress concentration for two or more <b>close</b> pitting <b>holes</b> should be considered for the fatigue prediction life under fatigue loading and corrosion attack applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The convex payoff {{structure}} in professional golf rewards scoring volatility, {{giving rise to}} player types who succeed in spite of higher average scoring. The same risk incentives should influence all players to adjust risk strategies at key moments in tournaments when payoffs either crystalize or become particularly convex. This paper develops a simple theoretical framework, then explores the empirical evidence for strategic risk adjustment by players over the 2003 – 2012 PGA Tour seasons. Findings suggest that players respond measurably on average to risk incentives around the cutline, but much less so (if at all) to leaderboard position on the <b>closing</b> <b>holes</b> of a tournament. Both the payoff to risk and the technical capacity of players to add or subtract risk are estimated. Analysis of individual players indicates that some elite players are more risk responsive. Bias (e. g. loss aversion) is discussed along with other possible explanations for the apparent lack of risk response over the <b>closing</b> <b>holes</b> of a tournament...|$|R
25|$|A flute {{produces}} {{sound when}} {{a stream of}} air directed across {{a hole in the}} instrument creates a vibration of air at the hole. The airstream creates a Bernoulli or siphon.

40|$|Random hole {{optical fibers}} (RHOF) offer {{advantages}} over {{other types of}} microstructured optical fibers (MOFs). They are inexpensive and easy-to-make {{when compared to the}} high cost of ordered hole MOFs. They also have unique characteristics since they contain open and <b>closed</b> <b>holes.</b> The open holes contain ambient air under normal conditions and the <b>closed</b> <b>holes</b> contain residual gases from the fabrication process at certain pressure. The objective of this research work was to investigate the radiation resistance of Random Hole Optical Fibers (RHOF) for possible use as both sensing element and data transmission medium in nuclear reactor instrumentation and control applications. This work is motivated by the demand for efficient, cost effective, and safe operation of nuclear power plants, which accounts for more than 14 % of the world’s electricity production. This work has studied the effect of gamma irradiation on RHOF fibers by comparing their performance to that of standard solid telecommunication fibers and commercially available specialty solid fiber designed to be radiations hardened fiber. The fibers were evaluated at different absorbed dose levels: 12 mGy(Si), 350 mGy(Si), and 7200 Gy(Si) by measuring their radiation induced absorption (RIA) on-line.

50|$|The {{resonant}} {{frequencies of}} the air column in a pipe are inversely proportional to the pipe's effective length. In other words, a shorter pipe produces higher notes. For a pipe with no tone holes but open at both ends, the effective length is the physical length of the pipe plus a little more for the small volumes of air just beyond {{the ends of the}} pipe that are also involved in the resonance. An open hole anywhere along the middle of the pipe shortens the pipe's effective length and therefore raises the pitch of the notes it produces. The <b>closer</b> an open <b>hole</b> is to the blowing end, the shorter the remaining effective length is and the more it raises the pitch. Generally, a hole in a given position doesn't reduce the effective length quite as much as cutting the pipe at that position would, and the smaller the hole, the less it reduces the effective length when open. <b>Closing</b> the <b>hole</b> increases the effective length and lowers the pitch again. However, a pipe with a <b>closed</b> tone <b>hole</b> is not acoustically identical to a pipe with no hole; the shape of the fingertip or pad that <b>closes</b> the <b>hole</b> modifies the pipe's internal volume and effective length.|$|R

50|$|This is {{the easiest}} of the techniques, but the least useful. After a hole is milled with an FIB, one can just image the hole (analogous to the TEM technique). The ions stimulate {{movement}} on the wafer, and also implant themselves to help <b>close</b> the <b>hole.</b> Unlike the other two methods, the <b>holes</b> <b>closed</b> in this technique are not very circular and smooth. The holes appear jagged under TEM photos. Also, it is much harder to control {{the size of the}} hole to the single nanometer regime. Another drawback to this technique is that while imaging the hole, the ion beam is continually sputtering membrane material away. If the beam scan area is large enough, the rate of atoms moving to <b>close</b> the <b>hole</b> will be greater than the rate of sputtering, so the <b>hole</b> will <b>close.</b> If the membrane is too thin or the scan area too small, then the rate of sputtering will win, and the hole will open up.|$|R
