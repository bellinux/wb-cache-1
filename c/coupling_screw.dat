40|$|To {{study the}} fluid motion-vehicle {{dynamics}} interaction, {{a model of}} four, liquid filled two-axle container freight wagons was set up. The railway vehicle has been modelled as a multi-body system (MBS). To include fluid sloshing, an equivalent mechanical model has been developed and incorporated. The influence of several factors has been studied in computer simulations, such as track defects, curve negotiation, train velocity, wheel wear, liquid and solid wagonload, and container baffles. SIMPACK {{has been used for}} MBS analysis, and ANSYS for liquid sloshing modelling and equivalent mechanical systems validation. Acceleration and braking manoeuvres of the freight train set the liquid cargo into motion. This longitudinal sloshing motion of the fluid cargo inside the tanks initiated a swinging motion of some components of the coupling gear. The coupling gear consists of UIC standard traction hooks and coupling screws that are located between buffers. One of the coupling screws is placed in the traction hook of the opposite wagon thus joining the two wagons, whereas the unused <b>coupling</b> <b>screw</b> rests on a hanger. Simulation results showed that, for certain combinations of type of liquid, filling level and container dimensions, the liquid cargo could provoke an undesirable, although not hazardous, release of the unused <b>coupling</b> <b>screw</b> from its hanger. The coupling screw's release was especially obtained when a period of acceleration was followed by an abrupt braking manoeuvre at 1 m/s 2. It was shown that a resonance effect between the liquid's oscillation and the coupling screw's rotary motion could be the reason for the coupling screw's undesired release. Possible solutions to avoid the phenomenon are given. Acceleration and braking manoeuvres of the freight train set the liquid cargo into motion. This longitudinal sloshing motion of the fluid cargo inside the tanks initiated a swinging motion of some components of the coupling gear. The coupling gear consists of UIC standard traction hooks and coupling screws that are located between buffers. One of the coupling screws is placed in the traction hook of the opposite wagon thus joining the two wagons, whereas the unused <b>coupling</b> <b>screw</b> rests on a hanger. This paper reports on a study of the fluid motion-train vehicle dynamics interaction. In the study, a model of four, liquid-filled two-axle container freight wagons was developed. The railway vehicle has been modeled as a multi-body system (MBS). To include fluid sloshing, an equivalent mechanical model has been developed and incorporated. The influence of several factors has been studied in computer simulations, such as track defects, curve negotiation, train velocity, wheel wear, liquid and solid wagonload, and container baffles. A simulation program was used for MBS analysis, and a finite element analysis program was used for liquid sloshing modeling and equivalent mechanical systems validation. Acceleration and braking maneuvers of the freight train set the liquid cargo into motion. This longitudinal sloshing motion of the fluid cargo inside the tanks initiated a swinging motion of some components of the coupling gear. Simulation results showed that, for certain combinations of type of liquid, filling level and container dimensions, the liquid cargo could provoke an undesirable, although not hazardous, release of an unused <b>coupling</b> <b>screw</b> from its hanger. It was shown that a resonance effect between the liquid's oscillation and the coupling screw's rotary motion could be the reason for the coupling screw's undesired release. Solutions are suggested to avoid the resonance problem, and directions for future research are given...|$|E

50|$|Guard Cooke was in {{the rear}} brake van of the train, {{together}} with six passengers, who {{should not have been}} there. Cooke and his passengers were drinking and smoking in the van, and Cooke invited passengers to apply the van handbrake. Correct operation of the brake was necessary, not only to slow the train, but also to control the tension in the carriage couplings. There were three separate breakages of couplings ahead of the rear brake van on the outward journey: at Brettell Lane and Hagley both the main screw couplings and side safety chains failed, and at Droitwich it was found that another <b>screw</b> <b>coupling</b> was failed, but its associated side chains had held. Cooke made temporary repairs on all three occasions. To repair the first two breakages, Cooke managed to find spare three-link or screw couplings; but at Droitwich he was only able to patch up the side chains, which were not designed to hold the full weight of a train. On arrival at Worcester, the train was examined by the inspector of rolling stock: the repaired/replaced side chains were replaced by four-link goods couplings before the return journey, but no attempt was made to repair or replace failed centre couplings: these were difficult to access, and the inspector considered that a re-made <b>screw</b> <b>coupling</b> was weaker than the goods couplings (which he considered adequate).|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{introduce}} a new <b>coupling</b> system between <b>screw</b> driver and interference screw, and biomechanical tests that validate the safety of its application. Methods: The new system was submitted to biomechanical torsion assays. Two types of analysis were performed: maximum torque of manual insertion of the screws into bovine bone; destructive assays of torsion of the system using an INSTRON 55 MT machine. The same tests were also performed on a control group, using a commercially available interference <b>screw</b> <b>coupling</b> system (Acufex (R)). Results: In the tests on manual insertion of screws in bovine femurs, the average values found with a digital torque meter were 1. 958 N/m for Acufex (R) and 2. 563 N/m for FMRP. Considering p> 0. 05, there were no statistical {{differences between the two}} groups (p= 0. 02) in the values for maximum torque of insertion, in the two systems studied. The average values for maximum torque of torsion resisted by the screw were 15 N/m for the Acufex (R) screw and 13 N/m for the FMRP screw, again with no statistical {{differences between the two groups}} (p> 0. 05). In the evaluation of angular deformation, there was also no significant difference between the two screw types (p= 0. 15). Conclusion: The new coupling system for interference screws developed at FMRP-USP revealed a torsion resistance that is comparable with the system already available on the market and regulated for international use...|$|R
