5000|$|Franklin's most {{acclaimed}} novel, <b>Crooked</b> <b>Letter,</b> <b>Crooked</b> <b>Letter</b> (2010), {{which won}} the Crime Writers' Association Gold Dagger Award, is regarded {{as more than a}} crime novel. For example, Marcel Berlins, writing for The Times of London, England, notes that [...] "Franklin's portrayal of small-town paranoia and racial politics is superb, as is his moving treatment of his main, damaged, characters.". In addition, reviewer Rachelle Lasky Bilz, writing for Teacher Librarian, notes the novel is more than a mystery as it [...] "explores racial tensions and the bonds of enduring friendships." [...] In an interview on National Public Radio, Franklin told the story of the novel's title, [...] "It's how Southern children are taught to spell Mississippi - M-I-crooked letter-crooked letter-I-crooked letter-crooked letter-I-humpback-humpback-I.". In brief, the novel, according to Publishers Weekly, is about [...] "Silas Jones and Larry Ott have known each other since their late 1970s childhood when Silas lived with his mother in a cabin on land owned by Larry's father. At school they could barely acknowledge one another, Silas being black and Larry white, but they secretly formed a bond hunting, fishing, and just being boys in the woods. When a girl goes missing after going on a date with Larry, he is permanently marked as dangerous despite the lack of evidence linking him to her disappearance, and the two boys go their separate ways. Twenty-five years later, Silas is the local constable, and when another girl disappears, Larry, an auto mechanic with few customers and fewer friends, is once again a person of interest." [...] In writing of the work, reviewer Jonathan Dawson notes it [...] "is a quite beautiful crime novel, sweltering with deep Southern menace, plotted with elegance and written in a melancholy tone that calls up echoes of Tennessee Williams at his most regretful, Southern best...is a fine addition to American Gothic and an unforgettable novel of transgression and retribution that lingers in the mind long after the finish". Furthermore, Franklin's prose shines in this third novel, being termed [...] "luminous," [...] "moody," [...] and [...] "masterful" [...] by Allison Block in Booklist.|$|E

5000|$|Two miles {{directly}} {{to the east of}} Midway City was the now-defunct Town of Bolsa, which was established in 1870. Midway City's northern most boundary, Hazard Avenue, is named after the great grandparents of Clyde Hazard: early American pioneers Robert Samuel and Betsy Ann (née White) Hazard, who moved from Hitchcock County, Nebraska with their children to the Westminster district in August 1881 and subsequently purchased forty acres northwest of the Town of Bolsa on February 6, 1882. Ann was a direct descendant of the White family, who relocated to Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620 on the Mayflower. In 1891, Midway City received its post office from Bolsa. In 1915, one of the top United States poultry judges, W. M. Wise, moved from Michigan to perform breeding and service work for Pacific Southwest Poultry Farm in Midway City. Seven years later, Midway City began to take shape in 1922 when John H. Harper purchased 200 acre of land based on the location of a local stagecoach stop and needs of the workers in the Huntington Beach Oil Field located west of the stagecoach stop. Harper subsequently subdivided his land by laying out streets, building sidewalks, and, in 1923, started selling lots. As the Huntington Beach Oil Field expanded, the homes in that area that stood in the path of drawing oil from the ground were physically relocated to Harper's lots in Midway City, which [...] "started Midway City." [...] The area, which now includes four unincorporated anemic sections as a result of annexation for the Westminster business district, is known as Midway City and the largest section looks like a <b>crooked</b> <b>letter</b> [...] "P". Midway City is six miles from Santa Ana, six miles from Huntington Beach, and seven miles from Long Beach, giving rise to the Midway City name. Harper Street, which vertically bisects the largest of the four Midway City section, is named after John Harper.|$|R

6000|$|Above {{and below}} the castle the river <b>crooked</b> like the <b>letter</b> [...] "S." [...] The lower loop was to the left, and embraced the high and steep {{projection}} which was crowned by the ruins; the upper loop enclosed a lawny promontory, fringed by thorn and willow. It was easy to reach it from the castle side, for the river ran in this part very quietly among innumerable boulders and over dam-like walls of rock. The place was all enclosed, the wind a stranger, the turf smooth and solid; so it was chosen by Nance to be her bleaching-green.|$|R

6000|$|It {{was little}} Owen's name for her. He was her special favourite--there was no concealing it. Lucilla {{did not need}} her as much, and was of a vigorous, {{independent}} nature, that would stand alone to the utmost. Owen gave his affection spontaneously; if Lucilla's was won, it must be at unawares. She was living in and for her absent father now, and had nothing to spare for any one else, or if she had, Miss Wells, who had the less claim on her was preferred to Cousin Honor. 'Father' was almost her religion; though well taught, and unusually forward in religious knowledge, as far as Honora dared to augur, no motive save her love for him had a substantive existence, as touching her feelings or ruling her actions. For him she said her prayers and learnt her hymns; for him she consented to learn to hem handkerchiefs; for him were those <b>crooked</b> <b>letters</b> for ever being written; nay, {{at the thought of}} his displeasure alone could her tears be made to flow when she was naughty; and for him she endeavoured to be less fanciful at dinner, as soon as her mind had grasped the perception that her not eating what was set before her might really hinder him from always having her with him. She was fairly manageable, with very high spirits, and not at all a silly or helpless child; but though she obeyed Miss Charlecote, it was only as obeying her father through her, and his constant letters kept up the strong influence. In her most gracious moods, she was always telling her little brother histories of what they should do when they got home to father and Mr. Prendergast; but to Owen, absence made a much greater difference. Though he still cried at night, his 'Sweet Honey' was what he wanted, and with her caressing him, he only dreaded her leaving him. He lavished his pretty endearments upon her, and missed no one when he held her hand or sat in her lap, stroking her curls, and exchanging a good deal of fondling. He liked his hymns, and enjoyed Scripture stories, making remarks that caused her to reverence him; and though backward, idle, and sometimes very passionate, his was exactly the legitimate character for a child, such as she could deal with and love. She was as complete a slave to the two little ones as their father could have been; all her habits were made to conform to their welfare and pleasure, and very happy she was, but the discipline was more decided than they had been used to; there were habits to be formed, and others to be broken, and she was not weak enough not to act up to her duty in this respect, even though her heart was winding round that sunny-faced boy as fast as it had ever clung to his father. The new Owen Sandbrook, with his innocent earnestness, and the spiritual light in his eyes, should fulfil all her dreams! ...|$|R

Here, with weeping and wailing in every room of his house, my companion worked alone for hours, solemnly surrounded by eyes that could not see him, and by lips that could not speak to him, patiently examining the tattered clothing, cutting off buttons, hair, marks from linen, anything {{that might lead to}} subsequent identification, studying faces, looking for a scar, a bent finger, a <b>crooked</b> toe, comparing <b>letters</b> sent to him with the ruin about him. 'My dearest brother had bright grey eyes and a pleasant smile,' one sister wrote. O poor sister! well for you to be far from here, and keep that as your last remembrance of him! ...|$|R

500|$|Colonel William H. Powell was {{commander}} of the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry regiment, and second {{in command of the}} brigade. Powell also performed well in the Kanawha Valley Campaign, leading (as a major) the advance guard of the 2nd Loyal (West) Virginia Cavalry that successfully attacked a larger rebel cavalry and drove it away. If the rebel cavalry had not been removed from its position, the entire Union army in the Kanawha River Valley would have been surrounded and prevented from retreating to safety. During November 1862, Powell led a group of 22 men that captured an entire rebel camp in {{what became known as the}} Sinking Creek Raid. For this action, Powell was later awarded the Medal of Honor. Powell, who had been told by General George Crook to not return from the Sinking Creek Raid without good results, received a <b>letter</b> from <b>Crook</b> in 1889 that said [...] "...I have always regarded the part you took in that expedition as one of the most daring, brilliant and successful of the whole war." ...|$|R
