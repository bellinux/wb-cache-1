2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1919 Latécoère {{had built}} a new and {{original}} design, which appeared at the Paris Aéro Salon in December of that year. Like the Salmson 2, it was a two bay biplane with unstaggered, equal span, constant chord, fabric covered wings fitted with ailerons on both planes and powered by a water cooled Salmson (Canton-Unné) Z9 nine-cylinder radial engine. However, unlike the Salmson 2 the Latécoère had an entirely metal structure, as well as completely redesigned wings of [...] greater (9%) span and with a 24% increase in wing area. The greater area gave an increase in load from [...] to [...] and an improved <b>commercial</b> <b>load</b> of the low useful load of the Salmson 2 had been an important limitation. The Latécoère 3's vertical tail was angular, unlike that of the Salmson though similar to the Limousine Salmson-Latécoère. The intention was to provide the Latécoère 3 with a similar limousine type, two or three seat passenger cabin with space for post to be carried at the rear, though this was never built; the Salon machine had two open cockpits with the pilot in front, as on the unmodified Salsmon.|$|E
2500|$|During {{testing of}} the caliber in 1988, {{it was decided that}} the full-power <b>commercial</b> <b>load</b> of the 10mm Auto was the best {{available}} semi-automatic pistol cartridge for law enforcement usage, but it produced excessive recoil for most agents. Thereafter, experiments were carried out, and a specification for reduced-recoil ammunition was created. The requirement was later submitted to the Federal Cartridge Corporation for production and followed further review. This became known as the [...] "10mm Lite", or [...] "10mm FBI" [...] load, remaining common from various manufacturers today. With some pistol reliability problems increasing in this lighter load, Smith & Wesson observed that a version of the 10mm case reduced to 22 millimeters in length from the original 25mm could be made with the retained performance parameters of the [...] "10mm Lite". This altered cartridge was named the [...]40 Smith & Wesson. The shorter case allowed use in pistols designed with similar dimensions to those chambered in 9mm Luger, with the advantage that smaller-handed shooters could now have smaller-frame semi-automatic handguns with near—or in some cases, exact—10mm performance. Colloquially called the [...] "Forty Cal" [...] and other synonyms, this innovation since became a common handgun cartridge among law enforcement agencies and civilians in the United States, while the parent 10mm Auto remains fairly popular. Colt, Dan Wesson Firearms, Glock, Kimber Manufacturing, Nighthawk Custom, Smith & Wesson, STI International, Armscor, and Tanfoglio still offer handguns in 10mm Auto. In 2015 SIG Sauer entered the 10mm marketplace with their P220 model chambered in 10mm. [...] Ruger introduced a 10mm auto model to their popular SR1911 line in mid 2017.|$|E

In this method the multiobjective minimization is proposed using genetic algorithm. Power losses (active and reactive) and improvement of voltage profile are minimized regarding to system constraints (Power equality, line capacity limits and voltage drop limits). Power flow has been done by Backward-Forward Sweep method. The proposed model has been applied to 37 -bus distribution system. 1...|$|R

50|$|The harbour was {{designed}} for small sailing vessels, and an awkward turn was required to avoid the protruding end of the outer harbour. Following the widening of the entrance and the fitting of new gates in 1971, ships of up to 600 tons were able to enter the harbour, but could only do so at high tide, and a system of ropes was used to manoeuvre vessels through the gates. By the 1990s, the size of vessels used for the transport of china clay had outgrown the harbour, and the last <b>commercial</b> <b>load</b> of clay to leave Charlestown did so in 2000.
