5|$|Most of the CCC-built park {{facilities}} {{are still in}} use today, including log cabins, picnic pavilions, a food <b>concession</b> <b>stand,</b> and miles of trails. Early on, the CCC constructed a dam at Black Moshannon Lake, {{on the site of}} the former mill pond dam. CCC Camp S-71closed in January 1937and Black Moshannon State Park officially re-opened that same year.|$|E
5|$|Synagogue dues were {{collected}} by the shamash (the equivalent of a sexton or beadle), who augmented his salary by working as a glazier and running a small food <b>concession</b> <b>stand</b> in the vestibule. There mourners who came to recite kaddish could purchase a piece of sponge cake and small glass of brandy for ten cents (today $0).|$|E

50|$|Movie theaters were {{at first}} hostile to food in their facilities, {{but during the}} Great Depression, theaters added <b>concession</b> <b>stands</b> {{as a way to}} {{increase}} revenue in the economically stagnant times. By the 1930s, <b>concession</b> <b>stands</b> were a main fixture in many theaters. During World War II, candy was scarce at <b>concession</b> <b>stands</b> because of the sugar rationing going on at the time, and popcorn became more popular than before.|$|R
5000|$|Added 1,140 new HDTV screens. Screens {{work through}} a system called Stadium Vision. Each screen runs on a {{separate}} video source, allowing menu boards at concourse <b>concession</b> <b>stands</b> to show game updates to fans as they order from <b>concession</b> <b>stands.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{debut of}} deep-fried butter in 2010 at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Canada {{may have led}} to a rise in {{attendance}} at the event. During the 18-day event in 2010, the <b>concession</b> <b>stand</b> purveying the dish sold 9,000 orders, which equated to 36,000 individual deep-fried butter balls using 800 pounds of butter. The dish was served in portions of four balls at the event, which totaled 315 calories.|$|E
5|$|Mile4 is {{situated}} at Point aux Pins at the northernmost {{point of the}} island. Here, M-185 turns southerly, passing the state boat dock and a nature center before coming to British Landing at the intersection with British Landing Road. The area is a popular stopping point for tourists biking or walking M-185; it is the location where British troops came ashore during the Battle of Mackinac Island during the War of 1812. Located around British Landing are various amenities including restrooms, picnic tables, and a <b>concession</b> <b>stand.</b> M-185 continues along Maniboajo Bay and passes the mile5 marker near Radisson Point.|$|E

5|$|Plan after plan is thwarted: Elaine tries bribing the maître d'hôtel, but is unsuccessful. They {{contemplate}} {{on getting}} food to go, but they can't eat Chinese {{food in a}} taxicab. Elaine is ravenous, but refuses to eat <b>concession</b> <b>stand</b> food at the movie theater. After missing Tatiana's call, George decides he's {{no longer in the}} mood for the film, Elaine wants to leave and get a hamburger, and Jerry decides that {{he might as well have}} dinner with his uncle. As soon as they leave, the maître d' calls their party.|$|E
5|$|A 1947 {{newspaper}} article {{estimated that the}} new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. In {{the southern end of}} the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls, as well as a new parking area for 200cars and a <b>concession</b> <b>stand,</b> both along Pennsylvania Route 118 (PA 118).|$|E
5|$|As {{the patrons}} leave due to not {{receiving}} a refund, the pictures going black {{when they were}} getting to important scenes, and complain about {{the taste of the}} popcorn (due to the mess the babies have made in the <b>concession</b> <b>stand),</b> Stu is angry at the fact that The Land Without Smiles went out at the climax. But at least they think that Tommy can go through a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go out to see the movie again next week, but at a different theater. As Grandpa Lou eats a candy bar in the back seat, Tommy takes notice of a flashing Reptar billboard as they drive by.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, Erie started {{building}} a waterworks on Presque Isle to provide fresh {{water for the}} city. Water from Lake Erie was pumped into two reservoirs on the peninsula, where particulates in the water were allowed to settle, removing them from the lake water. After treatment, the water flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the water from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking water for Erie operated until 1949. The pumphouse is now used for zebra mussel control and as a <b>concession</b> <b>stand</b> for bicycle and quadracycle-rentals within the state park.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010, a {{real estate}} {{developer}} approached the Cacchios with an offer to purchase the theater. A 501(c) nonprofit organization was formed in March 2010 to preserve the building, which secured a $50,000 grant from PepsiCo to help take out a $385,000 mortgage. Since completing its purchase of the theater on August 19, 2010, the Rosendale Theatre Collective has added a digital projector, surround sound system, stage thrust, and retractable screen. The group plans to add a <b>concession</b> <b>stand</b> and move the ticket booth outside during warm months. In late February 2011, the theater received a $175,000 state grant to renovate the building.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, Bonds passed Ruth, {{hitting his}} 715th career home run to center field off Colorado Rockies pitcher Byung-hyun Kim. The ball was hit an {{estimated}} 445feet (140m) into center field where {{it went through}} the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in center field. Then it rolled off the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball {{while he was in}} line at a <b>concession</b> <b>stand.</b> Mysteriously, radio broadcaster Dave Flemming's radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper, was not affected.|$|E

5|$|Seeing {{the damage}} they've done, the babies quickly rush back downstairs as the projectionist notices the {{incredible}} mess {{and tries to}} save the film unsuccessfully. Grandpa Lou finds them after getting some snacks from the <b>concession</b> <b>stand</b> (he comments on the mess the babies caused, telling Larry and Steve how in his time {{they knew how to}} keep a work place clean). Grandpa Lou takes them back with him to the Dummi Bears movie, which catches in the projector and melts The Land Without Smiles at the climax, leaving most of the audience groaning. The babies smile at each other at this, while Grandpa Lou eats some popcorn.|$|E
5|$|The Trylon {{closed for}} three months in summer 2017 as Kryshka {{supervised}} a major renovation and expansion of the theater, at a projected cost of $175,000. MSR Design of Minneapolis worked pro bono to create updated architectural plans. As part of the renovation, the entrance was moved from Minnehaha Ave to 33rd Street. An outdoor courtyard was created outside the entrance, a new lobby and <b>concession</b> <b>stand</b> were built, and the space was updated to be more accessible to wheelchair users. The auditorium was expanded from 50 to 92 seats, and a new screen and sound system were added. Relinquishing the Microcinema moniker, the movie house reopened as the Trylon Cinema over the weekend of September 22–24, 2017, with screenings of Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Nigel Dick and was filmed from 4 to 6 October 1999 at the Mission Tiki drive-in theatre in Montclair, California. In the video, Raven sings the song while {{she is in a}} car with a boy, while Larsen sings and plays the guitar in front of another car. This footage is mixed with M2M singing together at the drive-in, people dancing, the projectionist struggling with his malfunctioning equipment, and the <b>concession</b> <b>stand</b> worker who has an overflowing popcorn maker. When the popcorn stand explodes, M2M continue to perform surrounded by people as popcorn rains down. Air cannons were used to fire 200 garbage bin-sized bags of popcorn into the air to create the raining popcorn effect. In the US the music video made its premiere on 24 October on The WB following that night's screening of 7th Heaven. It began airing on The Box and MuchMusic in early November 1999 and began airing on MTV on 15 November.|$|E
