5|$|Following their {{transfer}} to the Army, the <b>Chinooks</b> were used in similar roles to those they had undertaken in RAAF service. The first operational deployment of the Army <b>Chinooks</b> began in October 1997, when two of the helicopters and three Black Hawks which were in Papua New Guinea {{as part of a}} training exercise were tasked with delivering food supplies to the highlands of the country following a severe drought. The <b>Chinooks</b> were also used to transport fuel supplies for the other ADF aircraft and helicopters involved in this effort. At this time, the deployment of two <b>Chinooks</b> was the largest the Army could undertake as the other helicopters were undergoing maintenance or were needed for training purposes. The <b>Chinooks</b> returned to Australia in March 1998.|$|E
5|$|A deal {{to upgrade}} {{several of the}} <b>Chinooks</b> was reached in May 1991. Under this arrangement, seven of the {{surviving}} CH-47Cs were sold to the US Army for $A40 million, the funds being used to partly {{cover the cost of}} upgrading the remaining four to CH-47D standard. The total cost of the project was $A62 million, of which $A42 million was required to upgrade the four helicopters and the remainder for spare parts, administration and new facilities for the <b>Chinooks</b> at Townsville. All eleven <b>Chinooks</b> were shipped to the United States in September 1993, and the upgraded helicopters returned to Australia in 1995. It was decided to transfer the <b>Chinooks</b> to the Australian Army, as by this time the RAAF no longer had significant expertise in operating the type and doing so would concentrate all of the ADF's battlefield helicopters with the same service.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1999, two <b>Chinooks</b> of No. 27 Squadron left base at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, {{carrying}} paratroopers to join NATO forces {{serving in}} the Balkans; six more arrived the following week in Kosovo to support operations such as casualty evacuations and transporting vital supplies. On 12 June 1999, waves of <b>Chinooks,</b> escorted by Westland Lynx and American AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, were used to rapidly deploy British infantry forces into Kosovo {{as a part of}} NATO's first phase of deployment. On 10 August 1999 hundreds of <b>Chinooks</b> around the world, including those used by the British armed forces, were grounded due to cracking discovered in the landing gear of a British helicopter during routine inspection.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Three {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} determine if and how steelhead trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, may affect <b>chinook</b> salmon, O. tshawytscha, when they are confined together as in a raceway or on a barge. We observed groups of <b>chinook</b> and steelhead together and groups of only <b>chinook</b> in a behavioral experiment to determine if steelhead are aggressive and if their presence changed the behavior of <b>chinook.</b> Two physiological {{experiments were}} completed {{to determine if the}} loading of steelhead on top of <b>chinook</b> and if the introduction of odor from rainbow trout (steelhead not available) caused a change in plasma cortisol levels in <b>chinook.</b> It was found that <b>chinook</b> showed characteristics of a schooling species, while steelhead exhibited territory holding characteristics. Behavioral changes in <b>chinook</b> were observed when steelhead were present. <b>Chinook</b> grouped with steelhead reduced their movements, darted less, were attacked up to 16 times more often, and were found less frequently in the shade than groups of only <b>chinook.</b> Steelhead were found to establish territories and defend them with chases, charges, and nips. In attempts to establish territories and defend them, steelhead attacked <b>chinook</b> as often as they attacked other steelhead even though <b>chinook</b> showed little aggression toward steelhead. In a physiological experiment, <b>chinook</b> experienced the loading of salmonids into their tank. <b>Chinook</b> had higher levels of plasma cortisol at 2 and 32 hours after the loading of steelhead than <b>chinook</b> that were loaded with <b>chinook</b> or controls (no loading). A second physiological experiment with odor showed that <b>chinook</b> that received rainbow odor and those that received <b>chinook</b> odor had similar levels of plasma cortisol. Cortisol levels (two hours after the odor was introduced) were higher in <b>chinook</b> receiving either of the scented waters than in those that did not receive any odor.

5|$|In November 1986 the Chiefs of Staff Committee and Minister for Defence Kim Beazley {{decided to}} {{transfer}} {{all of the}} RAAF's Iroquois and Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk battlefield helicopters to the Army; the <b>Chinooks</b> remained with the RAAF at this time. The transfer of the RAAF's other helicopter types increased {{the cost to the}} service of operating the <b>Chinooks,</b> and made it more difficult to find aircrew for No. 12 Squadron. The RAAF subsequently proposed transferring the <b>Chinooks</b> as well, but the Army was unwilling to accept them.

5|$|A {{decision}} by the US Army in the mid-2000s to replace all of its CH-47Ds with new-build CH-47Fs by 2017 endangered {{the viability of the}} Australian <b>Chinooks.</b> This was because the Australian Army's arrangements for the logistical support of its small fleet of CH-47Ds were heavily leveraged off those for the US Army's large fleet. In response, the Australian Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F <b>Chinooks</b> to replace its CH-47Ds in the mid-2000s. The Australian Government provided initial approval for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. As part of this decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales program to minimise potential risks to the schedule and cost of the project.|$|E
5|$|During 2005 the Australian Government {{decided to}} deploy <b>Chinooks</b> to Afghanistan {{as part of}} the Australian forces in the country. The need to prepare for this task contributed to a {{decision}} in October that year to dispatch Black Hawks rather than <b>Chinooks</b> to Pakistan as part of Australia's contribution to the international relief efforts which followed the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, despite the <b>Chinooks</b> being better suited for operations at the high altitudes affected by the disaster. In November 2005 the Government authorised a program of urgent upgrades to the CH-47Ds to improve their combat readiness ahead of being deployed to Afghanistan. The upgrades included fitting the helicopters with extra armour as well as new electronic warfare and communications systems. The helicopters' machine guns were also replaced with miniguns. A longer-term plan to upgrade the helicopters, designated Phase 5 of project AIR 9000, was also in place at this time. This was to involve two sub-phases: under Phase 5A new engines were purchased in December 2004, and were scheduled to be fitted in late 2006. It was also planned to put the helicopters through a mid-life update as part of Phase 5B, enabling them to remain in service until around 2025.|$|E

For six years, we recaptured wild subyearling <b>chinook</b> salmon smolts, which had been previously PIT tagged in the Snake River, to genetically determine if the fish were offspring of spring and summer (hereafter, spring/summer), or fall <b>chinook</b> salmon. Springfall <b>chinook</b> salmon comprised over 10 % of the samples of recaptured smolts in five of six years. For these five years, we used discriminant analysis to determine run membership of PIT-tagged smolts that were not recaptured (i. e., not sampled for genetic identification). Accuracy of the discriminant analysis models, based on genetically identified smolts, varied between 75 and 85 %. After using discriminant analysis to classify run membership for each PIT-tagged smolt that was not genetically identified, we compared early life history attributes between fall and spring/summer <b>chinook</b> salmon and calculated annual run composition. The life history attributes we studied overlapped, but spring/summer <b>chinook</b> salmon reared along the shoreline of the free-flowing Snake River earlier, were larger, and began seaward migration earlier than fall <b>chinook</b> salmon. Spring/summer <b>chinook</b> salmon made up from 15. 1 to 44. 4 % of the tagged subyearling smolts that were detected passing Lower Granite Dam. As a result, the presence of spring/summer <b>chinook</b> salmon makes migration timing for the fall <b>chinook</b> salmon seem earlier and more protracted than is the case.

Much {{attention has been given}} to the effects on <b>Chinook</b> of management of the freshwater part of the estuary, and the Sacramentoâ€“San Joaquin Delta, and especially to the effects on <b>Chinook</b> of diversions of water from the Delta. Here, I review available information on juvenile <b>Chinook</b> in and around the estuary that seems most relevant to management of the estuary and of <b>Chinook.</b> Most naturally produced juvenile fall <b>Chinook</b> enter the estuary as small fish (< 50 mm) that typically use tidal habitats, and anthropogenic changes in the Delta and around the bays have sharply reduced that habitat. Nevertheless, there is evidence that many surviving naturally produced fall <b>Chinook</b> leave fresh water at < 55 mm length. Juvenile <b>Chinook</b> from other runs are older and larger when they enter the estuary, and probably pass through it more rapidly. Presumably, these have been less directly affected by loss of tidal habitat, but are also affected by degradation of the estuarine ecosystem. The effects of Delta diversions on <b>Chinook</b> vary strongly by run and river of origin; surprisingly few Sacramento River fall <b>Chinook</b> have been recovered at the diversions. Central Valley <b>Chinook,</b> especially fall <b>Chinook,</b> are strongly affected by hatchery culture that reduces juvenile life-history diversity, probably results in density-dependent mortality in the estuary, and presumably reduces fitness for natural reproduction.
