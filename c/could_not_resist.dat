At this point, some buildings in Rabat were demolished to clear the fortifications' line of fire. By 1522, the fortifications were being modernized with the construction of embrasures. However, the walls were still regarded as obsolete, since they lacked bastions and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>resist</b> bombardment from modern artillery.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the 4th Army {{began to}} {{withdraw}} southwards on 9 April. On {{the evening of}} 9 April, Generaloberst Maximilian von Weichs, commander of the German 2nd Army, was ready to launch major offensive operations from the bridgeheads on the following day. His plan involved two main thrusts. The first would be spearheaded by the 14th Panzer Division breaking out of the Zákány bridgehead and drive towards Zagreb, and the second would see the 8th Panzer Division {{break out of the}} bridgehead in the sector of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska and turn east between the Drava and Sava to attack towards Belgrade. On the night of 9/10 April, those Croats that had remained with their units also began to desert or turn on their commanders, and in the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska on the right flank of the 27th Infantry Division Savska, almost all the remaining troops were Serbs. Due to the increasing momentum of the revolt, Petrović concluded that the 4th Army was no longer an effective formation and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>resist</b> the Germans.|$|E

5|$|Nikephoros, outnumbered and {{threatened}} by the Bulgars in his rear, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>resist</b> the Abbasid onslaught. He campaigned himself {{at the head of}} his army and seemingly won a few minor engagements against isolated detachments, but stayed well clear of the main Abbasid forces. In the end, with the harrowing possibility of the Arabs wintering on Byzantine soil in Tyana, he sent three clerics as ambassadors: Michael, the bishop of Synnada, Peter the abbot of the monastery of Goulaion, and Gregory, the steward of the metropolis of Amastris. Harun agreed to terms, which included an annual tribute (30,000 gold nomismata, according to Theophanes, 50,000 according to al-Tabari), but in addition, the Emperor and his son and heir, Staurakios, were to pay a humiliating personal poll-tax (jizya) of three gold coins each to the Caliph (four and two respectively, in Tabari's version), thereby acknowledging themselves as the Caliph's subjects. In addition, Nikephoros promised not to rebuild the dismantled forts. Rashid then recalled his forces from their various sieges and evacuated Byzantine territory.|$|E

5|$|On the left, on {{the other}} hand, Count William Louis of Nassau {{advanced}} with the remaining Dutch cavalry but was halted by the musketry fire of the 200 men standing on the advanced ditch. Aiming to disrupt the Dutch right, Verdugo then charged ahead of Frate's Albanian company and that of Baron de Bievres. The Dutch horse, disorganized by the musketry fire, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>resist</b> Verdugo's rush and turned back, breaking the order, in turn, of the English foot standing behind. To capitalize on this success, Verdugo ordered his foot to follow up the victory. Unaware of the Spanish success {{on the other}} side of the field, the English infantry continued pressing back the Spanish right flank until they reached the Spanish camp. When they realized what had happened, however, the Englishmen turned back in a vain attempt to escape. The Spanish centre and left were blocking the way, and thus the English attempted to save themselves fleeing across the bogged ditches, only to be killed in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Dušan the Mighty and the {{accession}} {{of his son}} Uroš the Weak, in December 1355, was soon followed by {{the breakup of the}} once-powerful and threatening Serbian Empire. It disintegrated into autonomous lordships that, by themselves, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>resist</b> Bosnia. This paved the way for Tvrtko to expand towards the east, but internal problems prevented him from seizing the opportunity immediately. A lordship on Bosnia's eastern border was that of Vojislav Vojinović. When Vojislav attacked Ragusa, in 1361, the republic appealed to Tvrtko for help, but to no avail. Vojislav's widow Gojislava, ruling on behalf of their minor sons, provided Tvrtko with passage through the family's land during his struggle with Vuk, and Tvrtko remained cordial with the family. He was, however, unable to defend her from her nephew Nicholas Altomanović, who, by November 1368, had seized her sons' lands. All Tvrtko could do was help the dispossessed widow safely reach her native Albania.|$|E

After Saladin occupied Beirut on 6 August, Raymond fled to Tripoli, because he thought that Saladin could also easily capture Tyre.
