25|$|In 1944 at Bretton Woods, as {{a result}} of the {{collective}} conventional wisdom of the time, representatives from all the leading allied nations collectively favored a regulated system of fixed exchange rates, indirectly disciplined by a US dollar tied to gold—a system that relied on a regulated market economy with tight controls on the values of currencies. Flows of speculative international finance were curtailed by shunting them through and limiting them via central banks. This meant that international flows of investment went into foreign direct investment (FDI)—i.e., construction of factories overseas, rather than international <b>currency</b> <b>manipulation</b> or bond markets. Although the national experts disagreed to some degree on the specific implementation of this system, all agreed on the need for tight controls.|$|E

Its main findings are the following ones: Recent economic and political development rise concerns among policy makers and executives. Argentina applies strong interventionist policy and frequently interfere into the free market functioning. Among the most important issues are: foreign <b>currency</b> controls, <b>manipulation</b> of statistical results and noncompliance with its debt obligation. In various occasion expropriated private companies with aim of markets correction. The thesis also presents a case study of the Spanish company Repsol, whose investments in the Argentinean YPF were nationalized. According to my findings this act occurred under unconventional procedure and violated several laws and agreements. These policies resulted in the lower confidence among foreign investors. And despite that final figures for 2012 are still not available, there are various signs that the level of investment declines...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{countries}} {{are more likely}} than developed countries to pursue a fixed exchange rate regime, yet this pattern is not directly predicted by conventional theories of optimum currency area. The first Chapter proposes a new theory of exchange rate regime choice [...] -different from the policy maker's credibility argument in the "fear of floating" theory [...] -that stresses the roles of both stage of economic development and labor market frictions. In general, for a typical developing country with low labor productivity and high labor market frictions, a fixed exchange rate regime would yield a higher level of welfare than a floating regime as the former generates more export revenue. The opposite is true for a country with high labor productivity or a more flexible labor market. We provide empirical evidence that is consistent with the key predictions of the theory. The second chapter investigates some new hypothesis of the high savings rates and current account surpluses in countries like China. Large savings and current account surpluses by China and other {{countries are}} said to be a contributor to the global current account imbalances. In this chapter, we propose a theory of excess savings based on a major transformation in many of these societies, namely, a steady increase in the surplus of men relative to women. We construct an OLG model with two sexes and a desire to marry. We show conditions under which an intensified competition in the marriage market can induce men to raise their savings rate, and produce a rise in both the aggregate savings and current account surplus. This effect is economically significant if the biological desire to have a partner of the opposite sex is strong. A calibration of the model suggests that this factor could generate economically significant current account responses, or between one third and a half of the actual current account imbalances observed in the data. In the third chapter, we analyze how the social structual change [...] the rise in the sex ratios [...] may affect the real exchange rate. We find that a rise in the sex ratio, in theory, can simultaneously generate a decline in the real exchange rate (RER) and a rise in the current account surplus. We demonstrate this logic through both a savings channel and an effective labor supply channel. In this model, a low RER is not a cause of the current account surplus, nor is it a consequence of <b>currency</b> <b>manipulations.</b> Empirically, those economies with a high sex ratio tend to have a low real exchange rate, beyond what {{can be explained by the}} Balassa-Samuelson effect, financial underdevelopment, dependence ratio, and exchange rate regime classifications. Once these factors are accounted for, the Chinese real exchange rate is estimated to be undervalued by only a relatively trivial amount. The last chapter studies the entrepreneurial activities in countries like China who have experienced a severe rise in the pre-marriage age cohort's sex ratio. In this chapter, we present a theoretical model and find that, when the sex ratio is large, a rise in the sex ratio will induce men to take the risk and pursue the high returns, which leads to an increase in the entrepreneurial activities in the economy. In an open economy model with two sectors, a risky sector and a risk free sector, we show that a country with a very skewed sex ratio is more likely to have a comparative advantage in the risky sectors. We provide empirical evidence that is consistent with the theoretical predictions...|$|R

2500|$|Henry III {{exploited}} {{the association of}} the franc as sound money worth one livre tournois when he sought to stabilize French currency in 1577. By this time, inflows of gold and silver from Spanish America had caused inflation throughout the world economy and the kings of France, who weren’t getting much of this wealth, only made things worse by manipulating the values assigned to their coins.

5000|$|From 2003 to 2014, China {{was a major}} {{currency}} manipulator. Economist C.

China's competitive position was thus strengthened {{by as much as}} 30 to 40 percent {{at the peak of the}} intervention. <b>Currency</b> <b>manipulation</b> explained most of China's large trade surpluses, which reached a staggering 10 percent of its entire GDP in 2007." [...] During this period, China's <b>currency</b> <b>manipulation</b> was a point of conflict with the United States. Domestic leaders within the United States pressured the Obama administration to take a hard-line stance against China and compel them to raise the value of their currency, and legislation was introduced to the United States Congress calling on the President to impose tariffs on Chinese imports until China properly values its currency.|$|E
