50|$|A cathode is the {{electrode}} {{from which a}} conventional current leaves a polarized electrical device. (This definition can be recalled by using the mnemonic CCD for <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> departs.) A conventional current describes {{the direction in which}} positive electronic charges move. Electrons have a negative charge, so the movement of electrons is opposite to the conventional current flow. Consequently, the mnemonic <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> departs also means that electrons flow into the device's cathode.|$|E

5000|$|The transitron oscillator, {{invented by}} Cledo Brunetti in 1939, (although {{a similar effect}} was {{observed}} in tetrodes by Balthasar van der Pol in 1926, and Edward Herold described a similar oscillator in 1935) is a negative resistance oscillator circuit using a pentode vacuum tube, in which, instead of the plate, the screen grid has negative resistance due to being coupled to the suppressor grid. [...] See the circuit at right. In the transitron, the screen grid is biased at a positive voltage (battery B1) above the plate voltage while the suppressor grid is biased negatively (battery B2), at or below the cathode voltage. Therefore, all the electrons will be reflected by the negative suppressor grid and none will get through to the plate. The reflected electrons will instead be attracted to the screen grid, so the screen current will be high while the plate current will be zero. However, if the suppressor grid voltage is increased, as it approaches zero (the cathode voltage) electrons will begin to pass through it and reach the plate, so the number diverted to the screen grid, and thus the screen current, will decrease. Since the other grids don't take significant current the <b>cathode</b> <b>current</b> [...] is split between the plate [...] and the screen grid : The division of current between the screen grid and plate {{is controlled by the}} suppressor voltage.
