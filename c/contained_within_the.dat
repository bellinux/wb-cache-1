5|$|The first {{reference}} to Hale is <b>contained</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Domesday Book, {{at the time}} 'Hale Barns' was just an outlying hamlet <b>contained</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> manor of Hale. According to the Domesday Book, the manor of Hale was owned by a Saxon thegn Aelfward, who {{was replaced by the}} Norman, Hamon de Massey who also gained possession of Dunham and Bowdon and would remain barons of the area until the 14th century. The manor was considered prosperous in comparison to other manors in the north west of England.|$|E

5|$|Alchemists {{thought of}} mercury as the First Matter {{from which all}} metals were formed. They {{believed}} that different metals could be produced by varying {{the quality and quantity}} of sulfur <b>contained</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> mercury. The purest of these was gold, and mercury was called for in attempts at the transmutation of base (or impure) metals into gold, which was the goal of many alchemists.|$|E
5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the above, in this early reference, no mention is made of live animals as co-inhabitants within the sack, nor is the mention of any initial {{whipping}} contained, nor that Malleolus, <b>contained</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> sack, was transported to the river in a cart driven by black oxen.|$|E
5|$|Later Greek philosophers, {{observing the}} motions of the heavenly bodies, were {{concerned}} with developing models of the Universe-based more profoundly on empirical evidence. The first coherent model was proposed by Eudoxus of Cnidos. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the model, celestial spheres eternally rotate with uniform motion around a stationary Earth. Normal matter is entirely <b>contained</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> terrestrial sphere.|$|E

5|$|Matangi {{is often}} named as the ninth Mahavidya. A list <b>contained</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> prose of the Mundamala equates Vishnu's ten avatars with the ten Mahavidyas. The Buddha is equated to Matangi. A similar {{list in the}} Guhyatiguhya-Tantra omits Matangi altogether, however the scholar Sircar interprets the goddess Durga – equated to the avatar Kalki in the list – as an allusion to Matangi.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been <b>contained</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E
5|$|Deptford borders {{the areas}} of Brockley and Lewisham to the south, New Cross {{to the west and}} Rotherhithe to the north west; Deptford Creek divides it from Greenwich to the east, and the River Thames {{separates}} the area from the Isle of Dogs to the north east; it is <b>contained</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> London SE8 post code area.

5|$|Different {{estimates}} exist of {{the amounts}} of indium <b>contained</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> ores of other metals. However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials (see Production and availability). Thus, the availability of indium is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} these ores are extracted, and not their absolute amount. This is an aspect that is often forgotten in the current debate, e.g. by the Graedel group at Yale in their criticality assessments, explaining the paradoxically low depletion times some studies cite.|$|E
5|$|During phylogenesis, {{cerebrospinal}} fluid is present within the neuraxis before it circulates. The CSF of Teleostei fish are <b>contained</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> ventricles of the brains, {{but not in}} a nonexistent subarachnoid space. In mammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, the CSF is present in it. Absorption of CSF is seen in amniotes and more complex species, and as species become progressively more complex, the system of absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal epidural veins in absorption plays a progressively smaller and smaller role.|$|E
5|$|If a {{publisher}} {{does not agree}} with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of The Punisher was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes <b>contained</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating. There is also an appeals process, but it has never been used.|$|E
