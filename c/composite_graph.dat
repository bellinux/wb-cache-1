The model-driven development of highly complex soft-ware systems may lead to large models which deserve a modularization concept to enable their structured development in larger teams. Graphs are a natural way to represent the underlying structure of visual models. Typed graphs with inheri-tance and containment are well suited to describe the essentials of models based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). EMF models already support the physical distribution of model parts. Based {{on the concept of}} distributed graphs, we propose typed composite graphs with inheritance and containment to specify logical distribution structures of EMF models. The category-theoretical founda-tion of this kind of composite graphs forms a solid basis for the precise definition of typed <b>composite</b> <b>graph</b> transformations obeying inheritance and containment conditions. ...|$|E

In this paper, we propose an approach of synthesizing test data from the information embedded in model elements such as class diagrams, sequence diagrams and OCL constraints. In our approach, we enrich a se-quence diagram with attribute and constraint information derived from class diagram and OCL constraints and map it onto a structured <b>composite</b> <b>graph</b> called SCG.

40|$|Process Algebra forms a {{cornerstone}} {{in the formal}} methods area of Computer Science. Among the more widely used approaches is Milner's Communication and Concurrency Systems (CCS). Recently CCS has been extended by Schmidt and Bibighaus through the introduction of Doubly Labeled Transition Systems. This framework has enhanced the model's ability to capture security and availability properties. In this thesis we reformulate, simplify, and extend Bibighaus' work using a graph theoretic framework. The intent is that this abstract mathematical view will make the results more accessible and stimulate additional research. Existing definitions and theorems are redefined and proved using Labeled and Doubly Labeled Transition Graphs (LTG and DLTG). CCS simulation concepts are recast as graph morphisms {{and the notion of}} abstraction and refinement are explained through the use of graphs. Bibighaus' work is extended by showing how to carry out non-atomic DLTG refinement, and by developing a form of graph composition involving graph refinements that share a common abstract graph.

Graph symmetries are studied {{in the theory of}} permutation groups and can be calculated in polynomial time with the nauty algorithm [15].

Our approach is focused on <b>composite</b> <b>graphs,</b> for which identical subgraphs reoccur in the graph.
