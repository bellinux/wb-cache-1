40|$|Organic {{farming is}} {{a rapidly growing}} sector both in Croatia and elsewhere. However, there is some concern as to what a {{widespread}} adoption of organic farming would bring to society as a whole. The {{costs and benefits of}} this development and the associated trade-offs are largely unknown and have hardly been explored. There is a vast body of evidence showing that organic farming in most cases environmentally outperforms non-organic systems. However, organic farming is associated with lower yields and its further expansion might lead to job losses in some other sectors and potentially jeopardise the overall economic strength of a country. This research presents an attempt to assess the environmental and economic consequences of the large-scale adoption of organic farming in Croatia in regard to national agricultural productivity, the labour force and environmental and economic performance. Besides farming the assessment has also taken into account the impact on farm-upstream linked sectors: energy, farm inputs manufacturing, trade, transport and research, education, advisory, veterinary and administrative services. In order to obtain the real value-added of these sectors, their gross value-added has been corrected for the associated environmental costs and public investments. The average annual results of the period 2001 - 05, representing the baseline, have been compared with fourteen development scenarios with different percentages of agricultural land under organic management, yields and premium prices. All of the organic farming scenarios perform better environmentally than the baseline. The gross and real value-added of the scenarios examined depends on the area under organic management and the yields and premium price achieved. In the case of a total <b>conversion</b> and no <b>premium,</b> in order to ensure the same gross value-added, the average yields have to reach 96...|$|R
40|$|By {{leveraging}} {{the technological}} advancements in information, communication, and connectivity technologies, specifically the internet, firms continue to innovate and create value through new digital business models which are disrupting entire industries. More recent success stories include Spotify, a music streaming service which {{has transformed the}} way music is consumed and has disrupted the entire music retail industry as well as Dropbox, which has been attributed a similar disruptive role in regards to consumer file storage. However, competition and distraction in the online space are fierce and consumers often expect products and services {{on the internet to}} be free, urging firms to rethink the design of their conversion funnel to win new customers and thus capture the value they create. The conversion funnel describes the transformation users undergo when sequentially proceeding through four stages to ultimately complete an online transaction with the firm: from being a non-visitor to becoming a visitor (also called acquisition), to becoming a registered user (also called activation) and lastly a converted customer (also called customer conversion). While Information Systems (IS) research on the conversion funnel of digital business models has dealt quite extensively with the antecedents of consumer decision making {{in all parts of the}} funnel, big questions remain as to how firms may actively shape desired outcomes in regards to acquisitions and customer conversions. Research on acquisitions has emphasized that traditional advertising is becoming less effective due to media saturation and consumers wanting to rely on more credible sources when seeking information on new products and services. This has lead mechanisms such as referrals, which relate to passing along messages received by the marketer to one’s peers, to become a critical component of marketing strategy. However, extant contributions have focused on the antecedents of consumer referral decisions, leaving a big gap as to how firms may actually enhance referrals and thus improve acquisition outcomes. Similarly, research on customer conversions has mainly focused on identifying the antecedents of consumer decision making at the neglect of shedding light on how one may actually shape conversion outcomes. On the other hand, IS research on activations is quite mature and has paid attention to both the antecedents of consumer decision making as well as how firms may drive better activation outcomes. Digital nudging, which refers to the practice of using visual user interface elements to influence consumer behavior in digital choice environments, has shown promising results in driving activation outcomes in this regard. For example, the usage of pull vs. push mechanisms in requesting information to consumers may influence their privacy concerns and thus activation outcomes. However, digital nudges have so far been widely ignored in the context of acquisition and customer conversions. Against this backdrop, three studies were conducted. The first study, by drawing on a randomized field experiment in the context of an online fashion service named StyleCrowd, investigates the effect of scarcity and personalization nudges in enhancing consumer referrals and thus improving acquisition outcomes. Building on this, the second study is focused on examining the potential of scarcity and social proof nudges as referral enhancers in the context of a randomized online experiment with the German startup Blinkist. Lastly, the third study examines how free trial order nudges may be used to enhance customer conversions within freemium business models by drawing on a contest-based online experiment. Overall, this thesis expands our understanding of how digital nudges may be used to enhance acquisition and conversion outcomes within the conversion funnel of digital business models. On the acquisition end, we provide evidence of how scarcity, social proof as well as personalization nudges may increase consumers’ propensity to engage in referrals and explicate the drivers that mediate these effects. Furthermore, we also shed light on the positive interaction effects between scarcity and social proof as well as the negative interaction effects between scarcity and personalization, and provide explanations for these phenomena. On the customer conversion end, we demonstrate how free trial order nudges may be used to enhance <b>premium</b> <b>conversion</b> within freemium business models. Besides unveiling the drivers that mediate this positive effect, we also explicate external factors that act as moderators. In sum, the contributions of this thesis are not limited to digital business models and digital nudges, but also extend into IS and marketing research on electronic word of mouth as well as research on cognitive biases. From a practical perspective, firms may leverage our findings for the design of their conversion funnel by carefully employing digital nudges to enhance acquisition and conversion outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis makes {{three main}} {{contributions}} to the literature on convertible bond financing. First, we provide a new theoretical explanation for convertible bond financing. Unlike the existing theory, our new theory provides a rationale for the issuance of both callable and non-callable convertible bonds. We also undertake empirical tests {{of the implications of}} the new theory and find that the new theory is supported by the empirical evidence. Second, we empirically examine the way in which firms choose the design of convertible bonds and investigate the effect of financial constraints on the firms’ convertible design decision. Consistent with our new theory, we find that the design of convertible bonds is influenced by both adverse selection costs and financial distress costs. Moreover, we find that the design of convertible bonds for relatively constrained firms is determined in a different manner from the design of convertible bonds for relatively unconstrained firms. Our findings suggest that taking into account the effect of financial constraints is important in the understanding of convertible design decisions. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to document the effect of financial constraints on choice of convertible design. Third, we empirically examine two alternative explanations for the late call of a convertible bond: the “optimal” call theory of Butler (2002) and the financial distress costs theory of Jaffee and Shleifer (1990). In contrast to the existing evidence reported in Altintig and Butler (2005), we find that the observed late calls cannot be explained by the effect of the notice period as incorporated in the optimal call theory of Butler (2002). The observed <b>conversion</b> <b>premium</b> is much higher than Butler’s optimal <b>conversion</b> <b>premium.</b> On the other hand, we find strong empirical support for the financial distress costs theory. Firms do not make a conversion-forcing call until the <b>conversion</b> <b>premium</b> is large enough to avoid a failed conversion, which could give rise to financial distress. We find that by the time a call is made, the probability of failed conversion is very small and the cross-sectional variation in the <b>conversion</b> <b>premium</b> is mainly explained by potential distress costs...|$|E

40|$|The New Business Tax System (Debt and Equity) Act {{established}} a set ofcriteria by which convertible securities could {{be classified as}} “debt-like” or “equity-like” for tax purposes. Using data on 256 convertible issues made in Australia between 2001 and 2012, we show that there is a strong relation between, on the one hand, a convertible’s ex ante classification determined at issuance using the tax criteria and, on the other hand, its ex post classification based on the <b>conversion</b> <b>premium</b> at maturity. We conclude that the criteria have been an efficient means of classifying convertibles. We also find an industry effect where debt-like convertibles {{are more likely to be}} associated with the resources, metals and mining firms, whilst equity-like are mainly issued by the finance sector. This finding is consistent with the solution to a finance-sequencing problem in the former case, and the impact of capital adequacy regulation in the latter...|$|E
40|$|A {{convertible}} bond {{may be an}} attractive financial instrument that helps to achieve the optimal capital structure of a company. In this paper, we analyze 562 issues of bonds from the American market between 2002 - 2013. Using regression trees analysis, we give some hints {{with respect to the}} design of convertible debt financing, which is the main goal of the paper, considering the most important characteristics of the issuers’ financial standing and the parameters of issued convertibles. Our research let us formulate a few conclusions. Firstly, we identified some relationships between a <b>conversion</b> <b>premium,</b> a conversion period and a conversion ratio applied by issuers. Secondly, it turned out that most of the issuer’s financial characteristics were not statistically significant for the issued convertibles. Finally, we found out that the share of fixed assets in the balance sheet amount seems {{to be one of the}} most important factors determining the internal structure of issued hybrid instruments, which supports the assets substitution theory...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} the stockholder reactions to convertible debt announcements made by Western European companies. We simultaneously test the impact of issuer characteristics, security design features, the stated uses of proceeds and the aggregate convertible debt issue volume. Our {{evidence suggests that the}} announcement returns are positively influenced by the maturity and <b>conversion</b> <b>premium,</b> and negatively influenced by the Eurobond feature, the level of post-conversion equity dilution and the aggregate convertible debt volume. We also document significant interaction effects between the issuer characteristics, the convertible debt design and the convertible debt market condition. First, we find that hot market convertibles are structured to be more 'debt-like' than non-hot market convertibles. Second, we show that the influence of the issuer characteristics depends on the convertible debt design: equity-like convertibles are perceived as instruments able to reduce adverse selection and financial distress costs, whereas debt-like convertibles are perceived as predominantly straight debt. Lastly, we demonstrate that issuer and security characteristics have much more power for explaining the investor reactions during non-hot markets than during hot markets.
