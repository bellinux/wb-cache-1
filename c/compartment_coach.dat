5000|$|Train number 168 {{en route}} from Kalundborg to Copenhagen Central Station was delayed by about 15 minutes due to the heavy traffic on the line. The train {{consisted}} of 15 wagons pulled by DSB Litra K 150. It was initially made of two baggage cars, a mail carriage, four two-axle 3rd class compartment coaches, a four-axle 1st class <b>compartment</b> <b>coach,</b> a four-axle 2nd class <b>compartment</b> <b>coach</b> and another two-axle 3rd class <b>compartment</b> <b>coach.</b> At Holbæk, four additional coaches were added at the rear-end (another two-axle 3rd class <b>compartment</b> <b>coach,</b> an old two-axle first class <b>compartment</b> <b>coach,</b> a two-axle third class <b>compartment</b> <b>coach</b> fitted with a heating boiler and a brake compartment and an open-plan 3rd class coach). The last wagon was a well occupied 3rd class passenger car. Most of the carriages were between 17 and 56 years old and only two (the 2nd class coach and the tail-end 3rd class coach) were less than 10 years old. All of them were made out of wood with steel frames.|$|E

50|$|Most of the <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> were rebuilt by the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) in the 1950s into Umbauwagen (rebuild <b>coaches).</b> The <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> that {{remained}} in the East German Reichsbahn (DR) had several compartments combined and, as on the six-wheeled coaches, every second door was removed. In the 1960s the <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> were converted to the so-called Rekowagen (rebuilds).|$|R
50|$|Several {{of these}} <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> {{were used for}} express {{services}} along the Ruhr (Ruhrschnellverkehr). They were given the DRG's red and beige livery used for multiple-unit trains. The window sections of second class coaches were painted in Stadtbahn blue-green (RAL 6004) as on the Berlin S-Bahn. Even 18 new <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> were bought for this purpose.|$|R

50|$|The <b>compartment</b> <b>coach</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the classic express train coach of the first part of the twentieth century; the corridor coach which also has separate compartments and is still known as a <b>compartment</b> <b>coach</b> in other languages (e.g. German: Abteilwagen). A corridor coach has covered gangways, side entrances and partitioned compartments with a corridor down one side.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{the removal}} of the driving <b>compartments,</b> <b>coaches</b> 1xx became 6xx, and 3xx became 5xx, but the 6-car trains became 6xx.|$|R

50|$|A <b>compartment</b> <b>coach</b> is {{a railway}} {{passenger}} coach (US: passenger car) divided into separate areas or compartments, with {{no means of}} moving between compartments.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} years of the line {{operation}} was by a steam rail motor called Enfield. This locomotive was a 2-2-0 locomotive and 36 seat four <b>compartment</b> <b>coach</b> on one frame. It was built by William Bridges Adams in 1849 at Fairfield Works, Bow.|$|E
50|$|Of the 21,000 <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> of {{all types}} that were built, 14,000 were handed to other {{countries}} after the First World War as reparations. Of these, 5,000 went to the re-emergent Poland.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} rationalise wagon {{maintenance}} the centre axle {{was removed from}} 1920 {{on many of the}} six-wheeled <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches,</b> because it had been established that this had no negative impact on the riding qualities. In addition, in order to overcome the pressing shortage of coaches following the ceasefire reparations of 1918/19, another 500 four-wheeled <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> of Prussian design were ordered (50 seconds and 450 Wagen third class coaches). In addition, due to the great shortage of wagons, many former Prussian coaches were reallocated to the south German railway divisions so that they could now be seen across the entire German Empire.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> in the 19th century {{comprised}} several cabins on one undercarriage, {{similar to}} the post <b>coaches.</b> <b>Compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> with doors for each compartment, without any connexion between compartments, were built {{up to the end}} of the 20th century. The disadvantages of this design were that passengers could not use the toilet or visit the dining car and that train staff had to climb along the outside of the coach on running boards in order to check tickets. Countless four-, six- and eight-wheeled vehicles of this type were used in Germany and especially by the Prussian state railways.|$|R
50|$|During the mid-1990s, a narrow-gauge railway was unsuccessfully {{proposed}} by the Ystwyth Valley Preservation Society—based on reopening a section of route from Llanilar to Llanfarian. Some items of standard-gauge rolling stock were moved into Llanilar station yard at the time - including an LNER <b>compartment</b> <b>coach</b> plus some 4-wheel tank wagons.|$|E
50|$|In 1849 the ECR {{introduced}} a steam rail motor called Enfield which {{worked on the}} Enfield Branch Line.This locomotive was a 2-2-0 locomotive and 36 seat four <b>compartment</b> <b>coach</b> on one frame and was built by William Bridges Adams in 1849 at Fairfield Works, Bow. It proved reasonably successful and in fact not long after delivery covered the 126-mile route from Bishopsgate to Norwich (via Cambridge) in a creditable (for the time) 3 hours 35 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Intercity {{trains are}} usually 7 to 11 coaches long, {{depending}} on the route. There are one or two first class coaches - one <b>compartment</b> <b>coach,</b> and one open on longer trains. A few routes still use restaurants, but most use a bistro cafe, which also provides half a coach of first-class accommodation. Most of the second class coaches are open, but with some compartments, and some ex-Interregio coaches. Cycle space {{is provided by the}} driving trailer, but these are not used on all routes, so there are some non-driving coaches with space for bicycles.|$|E
50|$|Until about 1880, four-wheeled <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> were typical. After {{the end of}} {{the wave}} of nationalisations the Prussian state railways, around 1895, {{acquired}} the quieter-running six-wheelers. For this, so-called norms were established for four-, six- and, later, eight-wheeled classes of coach. For the six-wheelers, both fixed axle and sliding axle designs were envisaged. Those coaches designed specifically for suburban traffic (Berlin, Hamburg) had no toilets. On the other coaches, a gangway was specified {{in order to keep the}} number of toilets to a minimum for economic reasons. Numerous coaches had therefore to be converted. After {{the end of the}} 19th century, fourth class <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> were also procured.|$|R
50|$|Four- and six-wheeled <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> were {{initially}} used in all train categories on main lines. With {{the advent of}} the D-Zug express <b>coaches</b> in 1892, <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> were deployed in passenger trains on main lines and in built-up areas. Here it became abundantly clear that, in addition a faster turn round of passengers, access to station platforms on main lines could only be permitted if passengers had valid tickets and trains could not be boarded until shortly before their departure. So ticket checking by the guard became a function of station staff. By contrast, open coaches were common on branch lines, because there were often no platform barriers on branch line stations and so tickets had to be checked in the train itself. From 1895, especially in Prussia and Saxony (but also to a lesser extent in Baden, Bavaria and Alsace-Lorraine), eight-wheeled <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> were built. They were predominantly used in the semi-fast trains or Eilzüge introduced in 1907 and in the so-called fast passenger trains. Over 3,500 coaches were built in several batches starting in 1818 (1918?). The <b>compartments</b> in the <b>coaches</b> were sometimes linked to provide access to the toilets. In third class coaches the privies lacked flushing facilities until some time later.|$|R
50|$|The term Eilzug was {{introduced}} first in Bavaria in 1902, {{and later in}} Prussia in 1907 and Saxony in 1908, for express trains with no supplementary fare, and which as a rule were formed of older <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches.</b> From about 1919 they only ran with second and third class passenger classes.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{compartment}} {{coaches were}} passenger coaches with several separate compartments {{in the same}} coach body, each compartment having its own doors {{on the side of}} the coach to enable passengers to board and alight. The <b>compartment</b> <b>coach</b> was developed at the very beginning of the railway era in England simply by placing a post coach body on a railway undercarriage. Compartment coaches were used across almost the whole of Europe and were built right up to the 1930s. On the European continent they were sometimes referred to as English coaches or coaches built to the English system.|$|E
5000|$|Oberholtzer {{said the}} men {{took her to}} the garage and forced her into Stephenson's car. Before they left, Stephenson told Clenck to stay behind and tell his {{associate}} Claude Worley {{that he was going to}} Chicago for a business meeting. When they reached the railroad station, Stephenson and Gentry forced Oberholtzer onto Stephenson's private train to Chicago. No sooner had they entered the train's <b>compartment</b> <b>coach,</b> than Stephenson grabbed the bottom of her dress and pulled it over her head. He then grabbed her hands, tore off the rest of her clothes, pushed her into the lower bed, and raped her repeatedly. He also bit her all over her body. [...] Oberholtzer was still intoxicated and unable to resist.|$|E
50|$|The main {{sphere of}} {{operations}} for the T 12 was the Berlin area, where it worked the city network, ring railway and suburban lines as a predecessor of electric S-Bahn traction. The engines had to be capable of rapid acceleration when in charge of <b>compartment</b> <b>coach</b> trains in order to achieve acceptable journey times, due to the short distances between stations on some routes. The T 12 was therefore a very powerful locomotive with strong acceleration in both running directions. In 1921 a follow-on order of 40 locomotives was built by Borsig, because the fleet was not large enough. After the electrification of much of the S-Bahn network between 1924 and 1929 the locomotives were switched to normal passenger and goods train services and shunting.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{the window}} frames on <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> - like the coach bodies {{themselves}} - {{were made of}} wood, which very quickly warped. After 1900 {{they were made of}} a brass alloy based on a patent by the Julius Pintsch AG firm. The upper part of the window frame on these coaches was rounded.|$|R
5000|$|The Umbau-Wagen or Umbauwagen was {{a type of}} German railway {{passenger}} coach operated by the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) {{which appeared in the}} mid-1950s. The name means [...] "rebuild coach" [...] and they were made by rebuilding or converting former state railway (Länderbahn) <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches,</b> many of which were over 30 years old.|$|R
50|$|In the {{timetable}} period 2014/2015 the EC Transalpin {{is composed of}} one first class open panorama coach of the SBB CFF FFS, the other coaches are of the ÖBB, including a dining car and a combine baggage car with first class seats, allowing to transport bicycles. In second class, both <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> and open coaches are offered.|$|R
5000|$|Eilzüge first ran in Germany in 1907. These were express trains (Schnellzüge), {{that did}} not switch to hauling the new through coaches, but stayed with the conventional, eight-wheeled <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> common at that time. Not {{until the end of}} the 1920s did the Deutsche Reichsbahn {{consider}} developing special wagons as eight-wheeled open coaches for the semi-fast train class.|$|R
50|$|On 22 July 1870, the {{mobilisation}} for the Franco-Prussian War {{made the}} main line unusable by the public at several points between Rastatt and Offenburg. The Baden State Railway’s rolling stock fleet at that time mostly consisted of two-axle <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches,</b> while the Royal Württemberg State Railways had sets of open coaches from the beginning. Baden later also moved to this system.|$|R
2500|$|During the {{construction}} period the railway rented some <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> from the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). [...] A Danish steam [...] locomotive was bought in 1919 and an NSB Class 9 was borrowed in 1920. The latter {{was needed to}} overcome the snow during winter. Passenger transport proved popular and when construction of the power station was completed in 1922, there was public demand for operations to continue.|$|R
50|$|From 1892 a new train {{category}} with especially comfortable express coaches appeared: the Durchgangszug or D-Zug (plural: D-Züge). Originally these were trains {{in which one}} could walk right through {{from end to end}} by means of bellows-type corridor connectors between coaches and side corridors or centre aisles within coaches, unlike the hitherto usual <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> with doors {{on each side of the}} compartment, but no access to the next coach.|$|R
50|$|The IC {{trains are}} quality trains serving longer {{distances}} in {{national and international}} traffic. They connect bigger towns, cities and tourist resorts. They consist of comfortable cars. They provide fast connection and call only at major stations. The train usually consists of open or <b>compartment</b> <b>coaches</b> (1st and 2nd class). Some of the trains may have a restaurant car. An IC supplement must be paid {{for this type of}} train.|$|R
