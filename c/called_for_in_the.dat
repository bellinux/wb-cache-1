5|$|In {{his first}} inaugural speech in August 1816, Jennings called {{attention}} to the need for an educational plan. In his 1817 annual message to the state legislature, he encouraged the establishment of a free, state-funded education system, as <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state constitution, but few of the state's citizens were willing to impose taxes to fund public schools. The state legislature believed priority should be given to creating government infrastructure. Lack of public funds postponed creation of a state library system until Governor James B. Ray's administration in 1826.|$|E
5|$|Under Patton, the Third Army {{landed in}} Normandy during July 1944 and {{would go on}} to play an {{integral}} role in the last months of the war in Europe, closing the Falaise Pocket in mid-August, and playing the key role in relieving the siege of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge in December, a feat {{regarded as one of the}} most notable achievements in the war. The rapid offensive action and speed that Patton <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> speech became actions which brought the Third Army wide acclaim in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|After {{the two new}} dreadnoughts {{were awarded}} to Fore River, Moreno was {{subcontracted}} out to the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey as <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final contract. Morenos keel was laid on 9 July 1910, and construction was overseen by the Argentine Naval Commission. After {{the completion of the}} hull, it was launched on 23 September 1911. Isabel Betbeder, wife to the chief of the Argentine Naval Commission, sponsored Moreno. The ship was then moored to a dock to commence fitting-out, which was finished on 15 February 1915. It was commissioned into the Argentine Navy nine days later.|$|E

5|$|Congress {{balked at}} the plan, seeing in it {{an end to the}} United States policy of {{isolationism}} and the beginning of imperialism. Even some supporters of naval expansion were wary; Senator Eugene Hale feared that because the proposal was so large, the entire bill would be shot down and no money appropriated for any ships. However, in April 1890, the United States House of Representatives approved funding for three 8,000-long ton battleships. Tracy, trying to soothe tensions within Congress, remarked that these ships were so powerful that only twelve would be necessary instead of the 35 <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original plan. He also slashed the operating costs of the Navy by giving the remaining Civil War-era monitors—which were utterly obsolete by this time—to navy militias operated by the states. The appropriation was also approved by the Senate, and in total three coast-defense battleships (the Indiana class), a cruiser, and a torpedo boat were given official approval and funding on 30 June 1890.|$|E
5|$|Khambatta also faced {{difficulties}} during filming. Due to the actress' personal objections, {{she would}} not appear nude as <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> script during the Ilia probe's appearance. The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold {{as a result of}} the shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E
5|$|Upon U-1s completion, the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{conducted}} {{trials of}} the submarine throughout most of 1910. On 5 April both of U-1s electric motors were damaged in a flooding incident during her trials. U-1s gasoline engines {{were never able to}} meet the speed <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> contract during the Navy evaluations, and were considered not suitable for wartime use. As a result, the Navy only paid for U-1s hull and armament, and arranged a lease of the gasoline engines while replacement diesel engines were ordered from the Austrian firm Maschinenfabrik Leobersdorf. Despite the engine problems, U-1 and her sister ship had the best performance in diving and steering amongst the U-boats under evaluation by the Navy.|$|E

50|$|Corrosion {{is thought}} {{by some to}} be a risk to any thinly built tether (which most designs <b>call</b> <b>for).</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> upper atmosphere, atomic oxygen {{steadily}} eats away at most materials. A tether will consequently need to either be made from a corrosion-resistant material or have a corrosion-resistant coating, adding to weight.

25|$|The Glanmire Bypass opened as a 6.3km dual {{carriageway}} on 3 April 1992, after a construction period of almost seven years, representing {{the first major}} improvement made to the Cork to Portlaoise corridor. <b>Called</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 'Land Use and Transportation Study' (LUTS) Report of 1976, the bypass replaced the older road through Glanmire village and was envisaged as part of broader strategic roads upgrade to service an expanding Cork City. Other components of this plan, such as the N40 South Ring Road and the Jack Lynch Tunnel, were substantially delivered and operational by 1999. The Glanmire Bypass was built by multiple contractors {{at a cost of}} 45 million punts. It was reclassified as a motorway in July 2009 and was officially incorporated into the rest of the M8 route on 28 August 2009.|$|E
25|$|Following {{permission}} being {{granted in}} 1941, {{the remains of}} Lua Getsinger were transferred in 1943 to be next to the transferred remains of Abu'l-Fadl (she facing west, he east, {{at the direction of}} Shoghi Effendi) to the Bahá'í Cemetery in Cairo, that was ornamented by 1947. However opposition also continued to grow – though work on translation had begun in 1934, in 1942 Egyptian police confiscated Arabic translations of The Dawn-breakers. After many efforts by the National Assembly, the confiscated copies were released on condition that this book should not be distributed in Egypt or sent out of the country. The Censorship Bureau of the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior requested the Assembly to renew their guarantee every fifteen days that the said book will not be put in circulation.

25|$|The Preaching of the Antichrist {{was painted}} {{shortly after the}} {{execution}} of Savonarola in Florence on 23 May 1498. This friar had been judged guilty of heresy, and the Antichrist, preaching slander and calumny, is causing an uproar such as Savonarola did. The Antichrist is depicted resembling Christ, but is embraced by the Devil whispering in his ear. Among the crowd listening to the Antichrist Signorelli has painted some remarkable figures: a young Raphael in a striking pose, Dante, possibly Christopher Columbus, Boccaccio, Petrarch and Cesare Borgia. Remarkably, in the left corner of the fresco, he has painted himself, dressed in noble garments, and Fra Angelico in habit. In the left background the Antichrist is being chased from heavens by the archangel Michael, and his acolytes being killed by a rain of fire. In the right background he depicts a large Classical temple topped by a dome in Renaissance style. More likely is that the scenes reflect scripture readings <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> liturgies for the Feast of All Saints and the four Sundays of Advent.|$|E

500|$|Along with Klingon cosmetics, makeup {{supervisor}} Michael J. Mills {{was kept}} busy preparing {{the large number}} of other aliens <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> script. Mills and his team created the largest makeup endeavor ever seen in a Star Trek film until then; custom makeup was applied to 22 principal actors, and as many as 126 prosthetic makeups each day. Because the alien creatures played such {{an important role in the}} film, there was a concerted push to provide enough money to the makeup department to make sure the complex work was finished. According to Mills, [...] " [...] we could prove to [...] that we needed something to get the shot done, then we'd have it." [...] The makeup lab employed a staff of 25 and produced over 300 prosthetics, from Klingon foreheads to Vulcan and Romulan ears. Work on the many extras began as early as one o'clock in the morning to be ready for the eight o'clock call.|$|E
500|$|Argentina's [...] {{was built}} by the Fore River Ship and Engine Company at its {{shipyard}} in Massachusetts.

Rivadavia was laid down on 25 May 1910—one hundred years after {{the establishment of the}} first independent Argentine government, the Primera Junta—and launched on 26 August 1911. Moreno was laid down on 10 July 1910 and launched on 23 September 1911. Construction on both ships took longer than usual, and there were further delays during their sea trials when one of Rivadavias turbines was damaged and one of Morenos turbines failed. The two were only officially completed in December 1914 and February 1915. Even the departure of Moreno was marked by mishaps, as the ship sank a barge and ran aground twice.|$|E
500|$|While {{the deal}} was {{initially}} for a [...] "one-week dialogue polish", Gottlieb eventually became the primary screenwriter, rewriting the entire script during a nine-week period of principal photography. The script for each scene was typically finished the night before it was shot, after Gottlieb had dinner with Spielberg {{and members of the}} cast and crew to decide what would go into the film. Many pieces of dialogue originated from the actors' improvisations during these meals; a few were created on set, most notably Roy Scheider's ad-lib of the line [...] "You're gonna need a bigger boat." [...] John Milius contributed dialogue polishes, and Sugarland Express writers Matthew Robbins and Hal Barwood also made uncredited contributions. Spielberg has claimed that he prepared his own draft, although it is unclear to what degree the other screenwriters drew on his material. One specific alteration he <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story was to change the cause of the shark's death from extensive wounds to a scuba tank explosion, as he felt audiences would respond better to a [...] "big rousing ending".
