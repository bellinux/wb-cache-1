5|$|On 13 April 1923 {{the light}} source was {{upgraded}} to a Ford-Schmidt kerosene burner with an intensity of 700,000 <b>candlepower.</b> It {{was changed to}} revolve every thirty seconds in 1928, to ease the operation. The stables originally constructed at the complex were converted to a garage in 1960.|$|E
25|$|The {{light output}} varied from 156,000 to 248,000 <b>candlepower</b> over many years.|$|E
25|$|The candela is {{sometimes}} still {{called by the}} old name candle, such as in foot-candle and the modern definition of <b>candlepower.</b>|$|E
40|$|A PHOTOMETER is {{described}} {{with which the}} scotopic <b>candlepowers</b> of very feeble light sources (down to about 10 − 9 candle) can be measured. Small spots of radium paint, 2 or 3 mm. in diameter and having <b>candlepowers</b> in the range covered, are now used (Livingston) to plot the dark-adapted visual field, and the present photometer was designed primarily for their calibration. The radium paint emits green light but the instrument {{can be used for}} measurements of scotopic <b>candlepowers</b> of any colour. By tests on colour filters whose scotopic transmission factors can be calculated from their spectral transmission curves, it is shown that the photometer does, in fact, compare lights {{on the basis of the}} scotopic visibility curve of the eye, provided the conditions of measurement are those indicated...|$|R
50|$|The lightvessel {{was removed}} on 9 November 1965 {{and the new}} {{lighthouse}} replaced it, operating at between two and three million <b>candlepowers,</b> depending on visibility conditions. The beam is visible for 27 nmi km. The lighthouse was automated on 7 April 1992, and the keepers came ashore.|$|R
25|$|Arc lamps of {{the time}} had very intense light output – {{in the range of}} 4000 <b>candlepower</b> (candelas) – and {{released}} a lot of heat, and they were a fire hazard, all of which made them inappropriate for lighting homes.|$|E
25|$|They now operate another Eurocopter EC135 P2, G-POLA, {{acquired}} in July 2010. The EC135 offers {{a range of}} capabilities including high definition thermal video recording, a microwave downlink to send images to control rooms, a 30 million <b>candlepower</b> spot light and an enhanced navigation system.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the hull}} was solid, no {{machinery}} or compartments were placed below the berth deck, the level {{just below the}} main deck. Instead, an electrical plant was installed on the main deck to provide power to 350 16-candlepower lamps, two 38,000 <b>candlepower</b> search lights, and a few electrical motors.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1879 the tower was struck by lightning. Cracks {{subsequently}} appeared in the masonry walls, which was remedied by placing a metal rod to connect the iron work of the tower with an iron disk sunk in the ground. In 1912 the <b>candlepower</b> of the light was increased from 27,000 to 80,000.|$|E
25|$|Typically, bulbs of 21 to 27watts, {{producing}} 280 to 570 lumens (22 to 45 mean spherical <b>candlepower)</b> {{are used}} for stop, turn, reversing and rear fog lamps, while bulbs of 4 to 10W, producing 40 to 130lm (3 to 10 mscp) {{are used for}} tail lamps, parking lamps, side marker lamps and side turn signal repeaters.|$|E
500|$|The Avery Point Light was not lighted until May 2, 1944, due to {{concerns}} about possible enemy invasions by sea. [...] D'Entremont {{notes that the}} first light, consisting of eight 200-watt bulbs, were an unusual array that created a fixed white light source. Though it never had a formal keeper, the lighthouse was tended by personnel or students from the United States Coast Guard Training Station. In 1960, the light was changed to flashing green and the <b>candlepower</b> rating doubled from 100 to 200. The light was deactivated on June 25, 1967 when the training facility moved from Avery Point to Governors Island.|$|E
500|$|A {{skeleton}} {{tower was}} already in place by 1919 and the date of replacement or removal of the original light is unknown. On December 17, 1919, the light characteristic was changed from fixed white to flashing white every 3 seconds and {{it was reported that}} the light's strength was 70 <b>candlepower.</b> In 1931, The Day noted that the skeleton tower was [...] "in recent years" [...] converted to automatic gas beacons. In 1963, buoys were established near the Essex Reef light. Currently the skeleton tower is active with a height of [...] and has a green flash every 4 seconds. It has a square green daymark with the number 25.|$|E
500|$|According to the Annual Report of the Lighthouse Board, {{the tower}} was struck and {{carried away by}} a barge being towed by Sachem, a tugboat, on May 10, 1912. The cost of repairs, $602.40, was paid by the owner. During the {{intervening}} period, a temporary light post was used in its place. Completed on October 22, 1912, the replacement skeletal tower was a pyramidal steel structure on a concrete base that held its oil internally. The base of the tower was painted white and the [...] daymark was painted black. The skeleton tower lantern was raised to [...] above the water and its light had about 170 <b>candlepower.</b>|$|E
500|$|In January 1929, a Notice to Airmen {{said that}} when {{visibility}} was bad any aircraft not fitted with radios were warned against using the Croydon–Edenbridge–Ashford–Lympne route {{or any of the}} alternative routes notified in 1927. Later that month it was notified that the aerial lighthouse had been replaced by a 6,000 <b>candlepower</b> neon light which would be visible at a range of [...] In July 1929 a plan was proposed where an amphibious aircraft would be based at Lympne for use in search and rescue when aircraft were reported missing over the Channel. On 14 August, the 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF arrived for their annual camp. In September 1929 arrangements were notified for the abandonment of a Channel crossing by aircraft flying from England to France. In such cases, the aircraft was to perform a second circuit over Lympne which would be acknowledged. It was also notified that a flying boat operated by Compagnie Aérienne Française was to be based at Calais for use in search and rescue work.|$|E
500|$|In June 1951, Walmsley was {{assigned}} to the 8th Bombardment Squadron, 3rd Bombardment Wing, Fifth United States Air Force which flew the Douglas B-26 Invader in Korea during the Korean War. During this time, he was described as [...] "cheerful and popular." [...] During the early phase of the war, missions included fairly simple bombing runs with [...] fragmentation bombs and [...]50 caliber machine guns. In the summer of 1951, {{the two sides of the}} conflict appeared to be reaching a truce one year after the war began. However, as the negotiations continued, North Korean and Chinese troops began moving supplies to the front lines while negotiations were taking place. The move caused United Nations (UN) troops to counter with [...] "Operation Strangle," [...] a new interdiction campaign designed to attack supply lines using arclights, bright lamps attached to the bottom of the aircraft, which would spot truck convoys moving at night. The arclights, with an estimated 80 million <b>candlepower,</b> would easily illuminate supply trains but also expose the UN aircraft to antiaircraft fire. As such, North Korean and Chinese trains were heavily equipped with such guns, and the valleys through which they traveled were heavily fortified with anti-air capability. Walmsley was one of the first pilots to volunteer for the dangerous mission.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 1948, various {{standards}} for luminous intensity were {{in use in}} a number of countries. These were typically based on the brightness of the flame from a [...] "standard candle" [...] of defined composition, or the brightness of an incandescent filament of specific design. One of the best-known of these was the English standard of <b>candlepower.</b> One <b>candlepower</b> was the light produced by a pure spermaceti candle weighing one sixth of a pound and burning at a rate of 120grains per hour. Germany, Austria and Scandinavia used the Hefnerkerze, a unit based on the output of a Hefner lamp.|$|E
2500|$|After the accident, the Coast Guard {{repaired}} {{the fire}} damage, {{decided that the}} place was too remote and dangerous, and automated the station in 1962. The 1,400,000 <b>candlepower</b> light was replaced with a 3,000 <b>candlepower</b> light. The Coast Guard carefully disassembled the 2nd order, 12 bulls-eyed Fresnel lens, hauled it down 141 tower stairs, packed it in six wooden crates, and then lowered the crates by block and tackle [...] down to the crib for shipment. After a protracted search, the Fresnel lens was found 37 years later at the Coast Guard Academy's storage warehouse in New London, Connecticut. [...] The base unit for the lens was relocated from the tower to the museum in 2000. The lens is now {{on display at the}} Marquette Maritime Museum. See, Marquette Harbor Light.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new light}} {{consisted}} of a [...] aviation-type rotating beacon of 250,000 <b>candlepower,</b> visible , and flashing white every 7.5 seconds. The steel skeleton tower, known as the Buxton Woods Tower, was retained by the Coast Guard {{in the event that}} the brick tower again became endangered by erosion requiring that the light again be moved.|$|E
2500|$|The Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage (International Commission on Illumination) and the CIPM {{proposed}} a “new candle” {{based on this}} basic concept. However, {{the value of the}} new unit was chosen to make it similar to the earlier unit <b>candlepower</b> by dividing the Violle by 60. The decision was promulgated by the CIPM in 1946: ...|$|E
2500|$|Twenty four inch {{diameter}} rotating beacons were {{mounted on}} [...] high towers, and spaced ten miles apart. The spacing was closer in the mountains, and farther {{apart in the}} plains. The beacons were five million <b>candlepower,</b> and rotated six times a minute. [...] "Ford beacons" [...] (named after Ford Car headlights) were also used, placing four separate lights at different angles.|$|E
2500|$|Sarah Dixon {{was then}} {{undergoing}} an extensive renovation at the Johnson & Olsen shipyard in Portland. [...] New electric lighting was installed, {{as well as}} electric headlights, driven by a 150 <b>candlepower</b> dynamo. [...] No definite route had yet been decided on for the renovated steamer, and the initial plan was to hold the Dixon in reserve for the Clatskanie route should anything befall the G.W. Shaver, which was then on that run for Shaver Transportation Company.|$|E
2500|$|Lowe {{purchased}} a three million <b>candlepower</b> searchlight from the Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893. The light was installed on Echo in 1894. So powerful was the light, that a claim by Lowe's publicist, George Wharton James, {{stated that he}} could read a newspaper by the beam of the light coming through his hotel window on Catalina Island. Exaggeration or not, the beam from the light did have a [...] projection. Residents announcing their birthdays could have the light shone on {{their homes in the}} evening. It was also known to stir up a corral of horses, invade lovers’ privacy, and interrupt an evening’s revival meeting. By the 1930s the light was considered a public nuisance and was shut off permanently.|$|E
2500|$|F4U-5N and -5NL Corsair night {{fighters were}} used to attack enemy supply lines, {{including}} truck convoys and trains, as well as interdicting night attack aircraft (such as the Polikarpov Po-2 [...] "Bedcheck Charlies", which {{were used to}} harass United Nations forces at night). The F4Us often operated {{with the help of}} C-47 'flare ships' which dropped hundreds of 1,000,000 <b>candlepower</b> magnesium flares to illuminate the targets. For many operations detachments of U.S. Navy F4U-5Ns were posted to shore bases. The leader of one such unit, Lieutenant Guy Bordelon of VC-3 Det D (Detachment D), off , become the Navy's only ace in the war, in addition to being the only American ace in Korea that used a piston engined aircraft. Bordelon, nicknamed [...] "Lucky Pierre", was credited with three Lavochkin La-9s or La-11s and two Yakovlev Yak-18s between 29 June and 16/17 July 1952. Navy and Marine Corsairs were credited with a total of 12 enemy aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The Germans floated a barge {{down the}} river {{carrying}} explosives but the U.S. forces captured it. They floated mines {{down the river}}, but they were intercepted {{by a series of}} log and net booms that the 164th Engineer Combat Battalion had built upstream to protect the tactical bridges. Hitler summoned special operations commander Otto Skorzeny, who on 17 March sent a special naval demolitions squad using Italian underwater breathing apparatus to plant mines. Before they could set out, they learned that the Ludendorff Bridge had collapsed, and Skorzeny ordered the seven SS frogmen to instead attack the pontoon bridge between Kripp and Linz. The water was extremely cold, about [...] The Americans had by then advanced so far up the Rhine that the swimmers had to enter the river [...] upstream from the bridge. They floated downstream using oil drums for support, but they were discovered by the 738th Tank Battalion who operated the top-secret, 13 million <b>candlepower</b> M3 Lee tank-mount Canal Defence Lights (tanks mounting an armored searchlight), employed {{for the first time in}} combat during World War II. Two frogmen died of hypothermia, two were killed, and the other three were captured.|$|E
50|$|In 1948 {{the term}} <b>candlepower</b> was {{replaced}} by the international unit (SI) known as the candela. One old <b>candlepower</b> unit is about 0.981 candela. In general modern use, a <b>candlepower</b> now equates directly (1:1) to the number of candelas—an implicit increase from its old value.|$|E
50|$|The red {{cast iron}} tower {{was built in}} 1899 by Penn & Bauduin of Dordrecht.It is made of many cast iron {{components}} bolted together.There are four floors and 42 steps.At first the tower had a 2,000 <b>candlepower</b> gas light. In 1913 this {{was replaced by a}} 12,000 <b>candlepower</b> gas light.In 1921 the light was replaced by a 20,000 <b>candlepower</b> electric light.|$|E
50|$|In 1907 a Fourth-order Fresnel lens was installed. The early {{coal fired}} system used {{approximately}} seven tons of coal {{to run around}} 1000 hours and when converted to oil ran 423 hours on 195 gallons of oil. The original 24,000 <b>candlepower,</b> provided by an incandescent oil vapor lamp, was increased to 30,000 <b>candlepower</b> powered by an electric lamp and the fourth-order lens, and by 1971 to 500,000 <b>candlepower.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "Candlepower" [...] {{is largely}} an {{obsolete}} term. However, {{it is still}} sometimes {{used to describe the}} luminous intensity of high powered flashlights and spotlights. Narrow-beamed lights of all sorts can have very high <b>candlepower</b> specifications, because <b>candlepower</b> measures the intensity of the light falling on a target, rather than the total amount of light emitted. A given lamp will have a higher <b>candlepower</b> rating if its light is more tightly focused.|$|E
50|$|The Glaciarium was {{illuminated}} by electrical lighting and used twelve 1800 <b>candlepower</b> lights {{and in the}} event of an emergency, there were five 1000 <b>candlepower</b> emergency lights connected to a generator that could be switched on quickly.|$|E
50|$|The first lantern burned mineral oil. A new lens, {{installed}} in 1868, {{is still in}} use. The present light source is a 25,000 <b>candlepower</b> lamp rotated electrically and controlled by an automatic time clock. The lens focuses a 1,300,000 <b>candlepower</b> signal visible for 25 mi.|$|E
50|$|The light {{characteristic}} is a {{group of}} two flashes that occurs every fifteen seconds, its focal plane is at 51 m above sea level with a white light intensity of 208,000 <b>candlepower,</b> visible for 32 km and the red, of 83,000 <b>candlepower,</b> visible for 19 km.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Candlepower</b> (abbreviated as cp or CP) is an {{obsolete}} unit expressing luminous intensity, {{equal to}} 0.981 candelas. It expresses levels of light intensity {{in terms of}} the light emitted by a candle of specific size and constituents. In modern usage <b>candlepower</b> equates directly to the unit known as the candela.|$|E
50|$|The {{light output}} varied from 156,000 to 248,000 <b>candlepower</b> over many years.|$|E
50|$|The Searchlight {{was able}} to {{illuminate}} targets from the harbour Heads to Ward Island with a power of 50000 <b>candlepower.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>candlepower</b> of a lamp was {{measured}} by judging by eye the relative brightness of adjacent surfaces, one illuminated only by a standard lamp (or candle) and the other only by the lamp under test. The distance {{of one of the}} lamps was adjusted until the two were judged to give equal brightness. The <b>candlepower</b> of the lamp under test could then be calculated from the two distances and the inverse square law.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{illuminating apparatus}} of the Batag lighthouse was of Barbier, Benard & Turenne (Paris) manufacture, with incandescent lighting system of 3,000 <b>candlepower.</b> [...] The third-order dioptric prismatic lenses revolving on mercury floats, {{which by the}} refraction and reflection of rays from the incandescent oil vapor lamps produce white flashes of approximately 100,000 <b>candlepower</b> which are clearly visible under ordinary conditions at the limit of their geographical ranges of 25 nautical miles (40.2 km).|$|E
