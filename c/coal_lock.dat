50|$|Doom Gems is {{a unique}} {{combination}} of a <b>Coal,</b> Bomb, and <b>Locked</b> Gem. Like <b>coals,</b> they can't be matched. Like Bombs, they tick down (but only on matchless moves). Like Locked Gems, they can't be moved.|$|R
30|$|About 3000 {{million tonnes}} of <b>coal</b> is <b>locked</b> up in {{standing}} pillars (Dixit and Mishra 2010) under varying geo-mining conditions, which is prime {{target of the}} mining industry {{to meet the demand}} of coal production. Present pillar extraction (depillaring) practices of the country have, predominantly, adopted intermediate mechanisation along with few fully mechanised depillaring faces. Most of these faces are operating at shallow cover. But the existing technoeconomical conditions of the industry are attracting a fully mechanised depillaring system for deep seated coal pillars, which is likely to grow in near future (Singh et al. 2011 a). In Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL), about 60 % of <b>coal</b> is <b>locked</b> up in standing pillars formed by Bord and Pillar method (Internal Reports on BG method in the SCCL). About 50 % of coal reserves in India are in seams thicker than 4.5  m, which come under the category of thick seams, the exploitation of which is consistently posing challenges to the mining engineers. Extraction of thick seams by conventional hand section method is neither productive nor effective from the conservation point of view (heavy loss of coal by conventional hand-section method). The percentage of extraction by hand section mining in thick seams is as low as 25 – 30 %.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Coal</b> River <b>Locks,</b> Dams, and Log Booms Archeological District is a {{national}} historic district and historic archaeological site located on the Coal River in Boone, Lincoln, and Kanawha County, West Virginia. It consists of an underwater resource depicting the navigation and transportation system used on the Coal River during the late-19th and early-20th century. It includes remains of timber cribs, locks and dams, and a lock master house. [...] It was designed by William Rosecrans in the mid-1850s, {{and was one of}} the first complete lock and dam systems in West Virginia.|$|R
50|$|The {{lock and}} dam system was {{repeatedly}} washed out by floods {{but continued to}} be rebuilt by investors. The system operated successfully from 1855 through 1861. In 1860 over 850,000 bushels of coal were shipped. The outbreak of the Civil War stopped operations of the system but in 1867 a new company was formed and the lock and dams returned to service until 1881. Altogether the lock and dams operated for 16 years. The system is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places as {{is a series of}} Log booms built after the locks on the dams were washed away as the <b>Coal</b> River <b>Locks,</b> Dams, and Log Booms Archeological District. The log booms helped to channel cut timber into Sawmill locations along the Coal River near St. Albans, WV.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Lunar Society, Erasmus Darwin belonged to the influential Derby Philosophical Society, as did his brother-in-law Samuel Fox (see family tree below). He experimented {{with the use of}} air and gases to alleviate infections and cancers in patients. A Pneumatic Institution was established at Clifton in 1799 for clinically testing these ideas. He conducted research into the formation of clouds, on which he published in 1788. He also inspired Robert Weldon's Somerset <b>Coal</b> Canal caisson <b>lock.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{village of}} Spragueville {{was founded in}} 1848. It is about 5 miles {{northwest}} of Stroudsburg. It was known for the manufacturing of sprags (or spragues). At the time, the wood sprags were widely used in <b>coal</b> mines to <b>lock</b> the wheels of mining cars to prevent rolling. The term sprag was also applied to the prop used to support {{the roof of a}} mine. It was from the local production of sprags that the village's name is believed to have evolved. About a year after the founding of Spragueville, the post office reportedly began operations, presumably with the Analomink name.|$|R
5|$|As a result, {{the force}} {{was called in}} to manage {{industrial}} disputes on a range of occasions between 1887 and 1906. In the mining town of Lethbridge, for example, the Alberta Railway and <b>Coal</b> Company <b>locked</b> out its workforce in 1894 during an attempt to cut staff and reduce wages; a team of ten police was deployed to maintain order, in particular any risks posed by eastern European immigrants, and to mediate in the dispute. Police deployed there again in 1906 for nine months during a dispute between the company, now called the Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company, and the workforce over union recognition, pay and working conditions. A team of 82 regular police were reinforced by 11 special constables recruited from within the company, with an undercover constable deployed to infiltrate the strike and send back intelligence. Efforts were made to collect information on the earnings of the union leaders, probably intended for use in discrediting them. The police maintained order and escorted non-striking workers past the picket lines.|$|R
2500|$|Rosecrans {{suffered}} {{a period of}} failing health and resigned from the Army in 1854, moving into civilian fields. He took over a mining business in Western Virginia (today West Virginia) and ran it extremely successfully. He designed and installed {{one of the first}} complete lock and dam systems in Western Virginia on the Coal River; today recognized as the <b>Coal</b> River <b>Locks,</b> Dams, and Log Booms Archeological District. [...] In Cincinnati, he and two partners built one of the first oil refineries west of the Allegheny Mountains. He obtained patents for many inventions, including the first kerosene lamp to successfully burn a round wick and a more effective method of manufacturing soap. While Rosecrans was president of the Preston Coal Oil Company, in 1859, he was burned severely when an experimental [...] "safety" [...] oil lamp exploded, setting the refinery on fire. It took him 18 months to recover, and the resulting facial scars gave him the appearance of having a perpetual smirk. As he concluded recovering from those injuries, the Civil War began.|$|R

50|$|Lodovico and Angelo {{join forces}} {{to play a}} trick on Lorenzo. Angelo convinces Lorenzo {{that he needs to}} {{disguise}} himself to gain entry to Franceschina's house, and he helps the old man dress up as Snail, the local chimney sweep, with blackened face and filthy clothes. Angelo arranges for Lorenzo to hear himself traduced and abused by other characters while in his chimney-sweep disguise. Franceschina, who is in on the joke, allows her would-be seducer into her house, but then claims that her husband has come home unexpectedly, and hides Lorenzo in the <b>coal</b> cellar. She <b>locks</b> him in the coal cellar and leaves him there.|$|R
