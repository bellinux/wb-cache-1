40|$|Residential {{foreclosure}} {{has been}} a serious issue during the recent economic recession in the United States, with {{a profound impact on}} individuals, households and communities. Various programs are being advocated and implemented to alleviate vacancy problems associated with concentrated foreclosures. This article explores how foreclosed <b>condominiums</b> might help provide affordable housing opportunities in urbanised areas of the U. S. We compare the selling prices of foreclosed and non-foreclosed <b>condominiums</b> in Tampa/Hillsborough, Florida, and then follow up with a neighbourhood study for four selected <b>condominiums</b> to assess their potential as amenable affordable housing options. It is found that foreclosed <b>condominiums,</b> although they do not have an overall statistically significant discount in market price, do show promise for potential affordable housing provision. The article contributes to the current discussion on foreclosures, vacancy and neighbourhood decline issues, and it especially seeks to offer policy implications in markets with a large stock of vacant <b>condominiums</b> but not enough affordable housing. However, the paper also acknowledges potential obstacles facing local communities when converting foreclosed <b>condominiums</b> into affordable housing...|$|R
