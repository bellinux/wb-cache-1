25|$|Suppose a {{listener}} cannot hear a given acoustical signal under silent condition. When a signal is playing while another sound {{is being played}} (a masker) the signal has to be stronger for the listener to hear it. The masker {{does not need to}} have the frequency components of the original signal for masking to happen. A masked signal can be heard even though it is weaker than the masker. Masking happens when a signal and a masker are played together. It also happens when a masker starts after a signal stops playing. The effects of backward masking is weaker than forward masking. The masking effect has been widely used in psychoacoustical research. With masking you can change the levels of the masker and measure the threshold, then create a diagram of a psychophysical tuning curve that will reveal similar features. Masking effects are also used for audio encoding. The masking effect is used in lossy encoders. It can eliminate some of the weaker sounds, so the listener <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> the difference. This technique has been used in MP3's.|$|E

Suddenly--in a moment--at absolutely the same instant--all spring into the air and fly away. How? They could not all see one another--whole treetops intervened. At no point could a leader have been visible to all. There must have been a signal of warning or command, high and shrill above the din, but by me unheard. I have observed, too, the same simultaneous flight when all were silent, among not only blackbirds, but other birds--quail, for example, widely separated by bushes--even on opposite sides of a hill.|$|E

50|$|Impaired {{hearing is}} one of the most common causes of {{language}} delay. A child who <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> or process speech in a clear and consistent manner will have a language delay. Even the most minimum hearing impairment or auditory processing deficit can considerably affect language development. Essentially, the more the severe the impairment, the more serious the language delay. Nevertheless, deaf children that are born to families who use sign language develop infant babble and use a fully expressive sign language at the same pace as hearing children.|$|E

This ‚Äòright‚Äô is, however, experienced differently by different people. This chapter considers how that difference could be measured and scaled according to how close one is located to the centre of white privilege. Similarly, questions of race and the experience of race discrimination could also be measured against one‚Äôs proximity to the centre of white privilege. My inquiry here is to consider where Indigenous identity situates in terms of discrimination experiences and how we might measure Indigenous life stories of discrimination. How do these stories situate with the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) (SDA) and to what extent might the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples create a space within which we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>hear</b> those stories but also effect change?...|$|R

50|$|Tabataba'i expresses that {{according}} to the thesis of general guidance, as the human reason cannot perceive the perfect law of happiness (Sa'adah) {{and he could not}} get it through the process of creation, there should be a general awareness of this law and it could be within the reach of every one. He adds there must be people who apprehend the real duties of life and bring them within the reach of human being. Tabataba'i refers to this power of perception, which is other than the reason and the sense, as the prophetic consciousness or the consciousness of revelation as the verse 4: 163 points to this perception namely revelation. Tabataba'i describes that the reception of revelation, its preservation and its propagation are three principles of ontological guidance. What the prophets got through the revelation was religion which consists of doctrine and practice or method. He further adds that with passing of the time and gradual development of the society, the gradual development in the revealed law is apparent. By three ways the speech of God reaches to man, by revelation or divine inspiration; behind a veil, man can hear God's speech but <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> him; or by a messenger, an angel conveys the inspiration to the man. By the verses 72:26-28 two types of guardians protect the integrity of the revelation: an angel who protects the prophet against any kind of error, God who protects the angels and the prophets.|$|E
