The peaks along the crater's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight, while the {{interior}} is perpetually in shadow (a Crater of eternal darkness). The low-temperature interior of this crater functions as a <b>cold</b> <b>trap</b> that may capture and freeze volatiles shed during comet impacts on the Moon. Measurements by the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the crater, which may indicate the presence of water ice.

5000|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>traps</b> {{are some}} of the {{important}} places on the lunar south pole in terms of possible water and iced deposits. <b>Cold</b> <b>traps</b> can contain water and ice that were originally from comets, meteorites and solar wind induced iron reduction. From experiments and sample readings scientists were able to confirm that <b>cold</b> <b>traps</b> do contain ice. Hydroxyl has also been found in these <b>cold</b> <b>traps.</b> The discovery of these two compounds has led to the founding of missions focusing primarily on the lunar poles using global scale infrared detection. The ice stays in these traps only because of the thermal behavior of the moon. These thermal behaviors are controlled by thermophysical properties, scattered sunlight, thermal re-radiation, internal heat and light given off by the earth.

40|$|Increased {{emphasis}} on energy management has helped sites reduce system cost through {{the diagnosis and}} repair of ?Leaking? or ?Blowing? steam traps (?Leakage Failures?). Timely maintenance response is a significant action to lower energy use and GHG emissions generated by steam production. But, what action should be taken with <b>Cold</b> <b>Traps?</b> In every steam trap survey to determine the steam trap population?s current state of health, there are usually {{a significant amount of}} steam traps determined to be ?Cold? or ?Low Temp? (?Drainage Failures? or ?<b>Cold</b> <b>Traps?).</b> It seems that site personnel commonly assign a lower response priority to these Drainage Failures traps, and sometimes actually implement a practice to intentionally convert Leaking <b>traps</b> into <b>Cold</b> <b>Traps</b> by closing the inlet stop valve to immediately stop energy leakage. Subsequently, they may label those traps as ?Valved- Out? or ?Out of Service,? but those trap stations were originally designed as needed to drain retained condensate from the system. So, the correct designation for such a <b>trap</b> station is ?<b>Cold,?</b> regardless of the current intention. If the trap station does not drain condensate and is not hot, it is ?Cold. ? It can be astounding that many sites are not convinced of what actions or priority to take to repair <b>Cold</b> <b>Traps,</b> even while intrinsically understanding that {{there is something wrong with}} having <b>Cold</b> <b>Traps</b> that cannot drain condensate from a steam system. It often is simply because sites may not be fully aware of the potential dangers of uncorrected <b>Cold</b> <b>Traps</b> or the significant safety, reliability, and energy benefits of addressing them. Although safety is always the main priority, it cannot be overstated that there are huge reliability and energy benefits to prioritized repair of <b>Cold</b> <b>Traps.</b> Unfortunately, proactive response to repair <b>Cold</b> <b>Traps</b> in a steam system is not always achieved, often because the real benefits of such a response are not understood. Therefore, further review of ?WHAT TO DO ABOUT COLD TRAPS?AND WHY?? is warranted for safe, reliable, and energy-efficient management of the condensate discharge locations (CDLs).

25|$|In 1844, Paul Thénard, {{son of the}} French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard, used a <b>cold</b> <b>trap</b> to {{separate}} diphosphine from phosphine that had been generated from calcium phosphide, thereby demonstrating that P2H4 is responsible for spontaneous flammability associated with PH3, and also for the characteristic orange/brown color that can form on surfaces, which is a polymerisation product. He considered diphosphine’s formula to be PH2, and thus an intermediate between elemental phosphorus, the higher polymers, and phosphine. Calcium phosphide (nominally Ca3P2) produces more P2H4 than other phosphides because of the preponderance of P-P bonds in the starting material.|$|E

The astatine volatilizes and is condensed in (typically) a <b>cold</b> <b>trap.</b> Higher temperatures of up to around 850°C may increase the yield, {{at the risk of}} bismuth contamination from concurrent volatilization. Redistilling the condensate may be required to minimize the presence of bismuth (as bismuth can interfere with astatine labeling reactions). The astatine is recovered from the trap using one or more low concentration solvents such as sodium hydroxide, methanol or chloroform. Astatine yields of up to around 80% may be achieved. Dry separation is the method most commonly used to produce a chemically useful form of astatine.At via the 209Bi (α,2n)211At reaction | journal=Applied Radiation and Isotopes|volume=47 |issue=2|pages=135–143 |doi=10.1016/0969-8043(95)00285-5|subscription=yes}} ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>traps</b> - Certain cave {{configurations}} allow seasonal convection {{to import}} cold {{air from the}} surface in winter, but not warm air in summer.

40|$|A {{new model}} for the basal {{pressure}} of Io's atmosphere is developed. This model {{takes into account the}} previously ignored fact that much of Io's surface has very high porosity, typically about 90 pct. Such porosity allows efficient subsurface <b>cold</b> <b>trapping</b> of atmospheric gases which tends to keep ambient surface pressures very low. SO 2 is the only gas identified on Io, and the basal pressures for atmospheric models are usually pegged to local surface temperature via the SO 2 vapor pressure equilibrium curve. Near Io's subsolar point the pressure in equilibrium with a surface SO 2 frost deposit is about 1 / 10, 000, 000 th bar. Porous surface models of the type developed invoke equilibrium with the colder, subsurface permafrost (at about 3 -cm depth) and yield pressures of about 1 / 10 to the 12 th bar. The subsurface <b>cold</b> <b>trapping</b> model explains many but not all observations relevant to Io's atmosphere.

40|$|A key {{question}} {{in the study of}} Mars is water exchange between atmosphere and surface on daily, seasonal, and astronomical timescales. We believe that small-scale processes are a key for enhanced understanding of the global water behavior of Mars. The principal data for this study of small scale properties of the Martian surface were collected by the second Viking lander (VL 2) and by both Viking orbiters. The annual deposition and retreat of the frost layer were observed in situ by VL 2. The frost is inferred to be H_ 2 O frost but with some properties suggesting a much thicker layer than would be expected from the simple mass balance calculation. Our original contribution is in considering the effect of <b>cold</b> <b>trapping</b> (frost redeposition) which has been previously neglected and which enables us to reconcile all the observations with environmental conditions. In addition, we believe that this study points to a more general phenomenon of <b>cold</b> <b>trapping</b> in the Martian environment. Our study of the VL 2 observations suggests that H_ 2 O frost occurs in two forms: (1) thin, almost continuous, early frost and (2) much thicker, patchy, later frost. Both frost forms contain essentially the same total water content, but they cover different fractions of the surface. The transition between the two frost forms occurs by recondensation at local <b>cold</b> <b>traps</b> when solar insolation sublimates the first frost but the atmosphere is still too cold to transport the resultant water vapor away. These <b>cold</b> <b>traps</b> are created by shadowing from the small-scale surface roughness, rocks, troughs, etc. This hypothesis hinges on the disparity between local and long-range transport of water vapor by the atmosphere. The local transport is driven by abundant insolation energy available at the time of transition. This results in a large fraction of surface frost being redistributed rapidly into locally thermodynamically preferable locations, <b>cold</b> <b>traps.</b> Long-range transport is constrained by the atmospheric carrying capacity. At the time of transition, the atmosphere is still cold, not far from its winter minimum, and is almost saturated by residual water vapor (5 – 8 precipitable micrometers). Therefore it cannot carry much additional water vapor to lower latitudes. This disparity delays the global transport of water vapor by the atmosphere...|$|R
