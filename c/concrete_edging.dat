50|$|The {{station was}} {{located on a}} double track section {{of the line and}} had a brick built {{platform}} with <b>concrete</b> <b>edging.</b> One overgrown platform still exists and the line has been singled.|$|E
50|$|The main {{facade of}} the {{building}} looks {{to the east and}} a grassed area where a large, circular garden bed formed by <b>concrete</b> <b>edging</b> is positioned. Its shape and extent are significant but not the edging. In its centre is a steel flagpole dating from the period of the School's occupation during WWII. The building wings facing to the west enclose a small courtyard which has large sections of concrete pathway and some plantings, none of which are significant.|$|E
50|$|The {{line here}} was single tracked without any sidings, however a signal {{box with a}} passing loop had been located here from 1899 to 1921. The single <b>concrete</b> <b>edged</b> {{platform}} had a small wooden shelter.|$|R
50|$|The {{roof was}} {{constructed}} using {{over a thousand}} plywood shutters, each with a different shape. The shell was cast first, and then lifted from its formwork as cables for the edge beams were put under tension. The <b>concrete</b> <b>edge</b> beams were then cast in situ.|$|R
5000|$|During the World War II the {{original}} MTK stadium was damaged, therefore {{a new stadium}} had to be built. Between 1945 and 1947 MTK played their home matches at their rivals' stadiums, namely Ferencváros and Újpest. In 1953 a <b>concrete</b> <b>edge</b> was built around the running tracks.|$|R
50|$|Anzac Memorial Park extends {{along the}} {{foreshore}} overlooking Cleveland Bay, with views to Magnetic Island. It is bordered {{to the west}} by Tobruk Memorial Baths, to the south by The Strand, to the east by the Townsville Bowls Club, and to the north by reclaimed land forming part of a recent marina development. The park {{is surrounded by a}} low <b>concrete</b> <b>edging</b> with obelisk-like pillars at regular intervals. Steel chains stretch between the pillars along the sea front (to the north) only.|$|E
50|$|Mulligan's grave {{is at the}} {{south-east}} {{corner of}} the cemetery, near a mature grevillea tree. It is marked with a marble headstone, made by W.A. & C. Whelan in Townsville and surrounded by a concrete border and cast iron fence. The fence {{is attached to the}} concrete with bolts. Both the fence and the concrete border are painted white. A bronze plaque, embedded in concrete and surrounded by white quartz pebbles, sits below the headstone. Loose white quartz pebbles are inside the <b>concrete</b> <b>edging.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{playground}} area is also {{located within}} the park and measures approximately 10m x 15m. It is delineated by <b>concrete</b> <b>edging</b> and filled with sandy loam to approximately 10 cm depth below the current ground surface. The installation {{and use of the}} playground equipment is unlikely to have caused major subsurface disturbance. There is a bench and a water tap situated adjacent {{to the north of the}} playground area, and timber bollards used to delineate the park area. None of the modern elements installed in the park are of archaeological importance.|$|E

5000|$|The {{pools and}} podium area also exhibit {{considered}} technical, decorative and sculptural detailing. The main pool has ceramic tiled rounded edging, a scupper channel to absorb waves, and hexagonal ceramic tiled patterns {{at the ends}} of the lanes {{on the floor of the}} pool. The wading pool is tiled in fluid abstract patterns. The diving boards are supported on splayed concrete columns, from which spring splayed cantilevered platforms, and steel balustrades and stairs with central steel stringers; the diving tower has curved stairs clinging to its northern face. The podium is paved with hexagonal concrete pavers flecked with exposed aggregate, and has raised seating and planting areas with hexagonal <b>concrete</b> <b>edging.</b> The diving pool and main pool have portholes which are accessed via a [...] "clubroom" [...] below podium level.|$|E
50|$|The Mossman Hospital {{buildings}} {{are surrounded by}} expansive lawns and spacious grounds. The long east-facing main facade overlooks a large tended lawn scattered with established trees and is set apart by a u-shaped bitumen drive. Two vehicle and pedestrian access points are marked by reinforced concrete gateways finished in a smooth cement render. These consist of a large central arch adorned with decorative brackets and a Maltese cross motif is set over the drive with two smaller arches on either side for pedestrian entry. The perimeter of the complex is enclosed with a recent aluminium tubular fence with a tubular steel fence at the rear, which is {{not considered to be}} of cultural heritage significance. Pathways through the complex are generally concrete. Garden beds with colourful foliage plantings are located throughout the complex and mark entrance points to the buildings. These are generally defined with <b>concrete</b> <b>edging.</b>|$|E
50|$|The yard {{comprises}} various garden beds with <b>concrete</b> <b>edging</b> set within {{areas of}} lawn. These beds wrap {{around the front}} and {{both sides of the}} house and line the front fence, parallel to it. They are generally rectangular, one metre wide and four to six metres long. A curving concrete path leads from the gate on Edith Street to the landing of the front stairs, dividing the front yard roughly in half with the garden beds arranged symmetrically either side. Midway between the front fence and the house are two circular beds, two metres in diameter, either side of the path. In line with the rectangular beds set off from the western elevation is a circular one at the rear. Similar beds break up the area of lawn on {{the eastern side of the}} house. There is also a narrow rectangular bed located at the rear of the lot about 15 metres behind the south-east corner of the house. A recent swimming pool and entertaining area have been constructed at the rear of the house and are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.|$|E
50|$|Construction of the pylon legs {{was carried}} out using {{automatic}} climbing system formwork, in lifts varying from 3m to 4m height. Each segment took about seven days to complete. When the climbing form reached a height of 72.9m, the <b>concrete</b> <b>edge</b> girder was installed by the form traveller supported by permanent stays was chosen - this self-launching system is designed for in situ casting of the segment using the free cantilever method.|$|R
50|$|Fourteen MCW Metrobus Mark II buses were {{acquired}} and fitted with guide wheels, which {{ran along the}} guideway's <b>concrete</b> <b>edges.</b> The vehicles were painted in a distinct livery, unique to Tracline 65, being silver with black and red detailing. It began operating in 1984. The trial ended in 1987 will all buses having their guide wheels removed and being used on normal services, with the last withdrawn on 26 April 2008. One, fleet number 8110, is preserved at Aston Manor Road Transport Museum.|$|R
50|$|A <b>concrete</b> <b>edged,</b> curved {{garden bed}} with a small cannon {{positioned}} centrally is located against the southern wall of the building, and decorative timber gates enclose the passageway between the office building and No. 2 shed to the east. A timber wharf extends from the southern elevation of the office building, and extends along the southern frontage of No. 2 shed with timber post and rail balustrade chain balustrade. This wharf has non-slip compressed sheeting fixed to the upper decking in traffic areas. A section of the wharf {{in front of the}} office building is recessed, with stairs down to a lower deck for smaller craft to berth.|$|R
50|$|On 3 March 1934 Queensland Holiday Resorts Limited, with 97 {{subscribers}} and 1880 allotted shares, was incorporated. A {{flying fox}} was erected soon afterwards using the engineering knowledge of Romeo Lahey and fellow director Lewis Day and Old Bill's previous {{experience in the}} coalmining valleys of New South Wales. It consisted of a huge wheel, the whim, laid horizontally {{at the top of}} the rise, pulled round by draughthorse to draw a heavy-duty cable on which baggage was strung for its ascent, about 150 metres. At night it was festooned with lanterns. The base of the flying fox was a large tallow wood tree, which is still extant, near the Mains Road toilet facilities, about 1.6 kilometres down the road from the lodge. The top pulley and loading/unloading point was right at the (now) <b>concrete</b> <b>edging</b> just west of recent barbecue facilities. A large eucalypt pointing north-west is thought to be the anchor for the top pulley. The flying fox operated until March 1947 when a road was completed to the lodge, largely by the efforts of Queensland Holiday Resorts Ltd after two years of discussion with the Main Roads Commission. The road became all weather in 1951 when it was taken over by the Main Roads Commission and it was laid with bitumen in 1969.|$|E
5000|$|To {{the west}} of the grassy section is a small {{grouping}} of Jewish gravestones and some Aboriginal graves, marked with sapling branches at each corner, and north of these is the Chinese Shrine. Native vegetation has re-established in these areas. A few relict trees, including mangoes, line the main track to the Chinese shrine for a short distance.The Chinese shrine comprises a rectangular concrete platform approximately 6 metres long by 3 metres wide lying in a north-south direction, {{at the southern end of}} which, and facing to the north, is an upright concrete memorial tablet, on which are written in large script the Chinese characters Tjin Ju Tsai: [...] "Respect the dead as if they are present". There are two other, smaller, inscriptions on this tablet. That to the right gives the date the shrine was erected: 'a lucky spring day in the third month of the thirteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Kuang Hsu (1874-1908), Ch'ing dynasty'. On the left the inscription reads: [...] "Erected, with respect, by the Chinese community of Cooktown". In front of this tablet is a low concrete altar, on which food offerings were placed for the spirit of the departed. The platform is enclosed by a <b>concrete</b> <b>edging</b> and an ornate cast-iron railing. Beyond the northern end of the platform and approximately 2 metres away are two ceremonial fire-boxes, constructed of fire bricks rendered with cement. Each is approximately 1.2m3 with a grate at the bottom. The open tops permitted paper prayers and temple [...] "money" [...] to be burned, assisting the spirits on their journey to a life beyond this world.|$|E
50|$|The {{concrete}} shell roof spans 225 xx 125 ft, with {{a double}} curvature sheet {{in the form of}} an elliptical paraboloid, mostly only 3 in thick but up to 6 in at the edges. It is claimed to be the largest concrete shell structure ever built, and the largest clear spanning dome roof in Europe. The shallow structure only rises 30 ft in the centre, and is supported by pre-stressed <b>concrete</b> <b>edge</b> beams with clerestory glazing below, so it appear to balance on its corners. It is pierced by circular rooflights. The external roof surface and gables on each side are clad in copper.|$|R
500|$|The {{church was}} {{demolished}} in 1809, {{in what has}} been described as [...] "an act of vandalism for which there can be few parallels even in the blackest records of the nineteenth century". Archaeological excavations in the 19th and 20th centuries established the building sequence of the church, and areas of missing wall are marked on the ground by <b>concrete</b> <b>edged</b> with flint. The ruins are now in the care of English Heritage. The sea defences protecting them were installed by Trinity House in 1810, but are now maintained by the Environment Agency. Fragments of the cross, and two stone columns that {{had been part of the}} church's triple chancel arch, are on display in Canterbury Cathedral.|$|R
50|$|Between Virginia Water and Chertsey, {{the line}} crosses the M25 {{motorway}} {{by means of}} a cable-stayed bridge. The bridge is of note because it is one of few such bridges to carry a heavy railway required here as the railway approaches the motorway at an angle of 28 degrees. The bridge consists of two concrete towers set into the central reservation of the motorway. The <b>concrete</b> <b>edge</b> beams are suspended from the towers, and each is supported by a pair of cables linked to the towers. The edge beams support a concrete deck slab on which the tracks run. The bridge is 120 yards (110 metres) long and 72 feet (22 metres) high, and was completed in 1979.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{campaign on}} the rupture at the member side of a typical floor-to-beam dry connection for precast structures {{has been carried out}} at the laboratory of Politecnico di Milano within the activity of the European Project Safecast. When subjected to horizontal loading, like the seismic action, a strong and stable behaviour of the connection shall be ensured, provided it is properly designed to avoid early brittle ruptures of the <b>concrete</b> <b>edges.</b> The resistance of the concrete side of the connection depends on many factors, among which the reinforcement detailing used in the local part. The experimental investigation regards the behaviour of such portion of the connection reinforced with a typical hooked rebar, studying also the influence of the addition of horizontal stirrups, metallic fibres into the concrete and the presence of pre-stressing tendons...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} edge-degenerate {{families of}} pseudodifferential boundary value problems on a semi-infinite cylinder {{and study the}} behavior of their push-forwards as the cylinder is blown up to a cone near infinity. We show that the transformed symbols belong to a particularly convenient symbol class. This result has applications in the Fredholm theory of boundary value problems on manifolds with edges. Introduction Pseudodifferential boundary value problems on manifolds with edges form an algebra in which parametrices to elliptic elements can be constructed by inverting the components of an associated symbol hierarchy. Operators of this kind arise not only in <b>concrete</b> <b>edge</b> situtations, but also in mixed problems, crack theory, and in the solvability theory of boundary value problems in corner domains or in configurations with higher order singularities. Pseudodifferential calculi for edge operators in the boundaryless case have been developed by Mazzeo [4] and Schulze [12, 2]. A crucial [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The 1967 {{residence}} is {{the most}} easterly of the structures in the complex. It is set behind a semicircular pathway which defines the edge of its front garden. The house is a low set construction, rectangular in plan, raised three steps above ground level and clad with vertical timber planking with a natural finish. This is reminiscent in character of the first slab hut on the property. Ventilation is achieved using floor to ceiling door and window openings, some louvred. The roof is low pitched in a simple open gable form with the ridge running {{along the length of}} the rectangular plan. The semicircular pathway in front of the house edges a well maintained lawn area in which is located a raised <b>concrete</b> <b>edged</b> pond. The surface of the pond is covered with a variety of water plants and large ornamental rocks are arranged within the pond.|$|R
40|$|In November 1989, {{we found}} the {{freshwater}} red alga Nemalionopsis tortuosa Yoneda et Yagi growing in the Kogane River at Amagi City, Fukuoka Prefecture in Kyushu. The alga was growing on the <b>concrete</b> <b>edge</b> and gravels at bottom in the Kogane River, where the depth of river is ranged from 10 to 20 cm and the water rans {{at the speed of}} 15 - 20 cm/sec. The water temperature in the river is 12 - 13 ℃ during winter. The well grown frond was about 30 cm long and about 1. 0 mm thickness. Morphological features of this alga from the new habitat, such as axial medullary filaments, assimilattory filaments and monosporangial cells, were almost {{similar to those of the}} original description for Nemalionopsis tortuosa by Yoneda et Yagi. The present finding of Nemalionopsis tortuosa growing at Amagi City should be noteworthy since this species was distributed districtedly in the southern parts of Japan and recently exterminated in many localities...|$|R
50|$|The {{symmetrical}} formal {{garden with}} <b>concrete</b> <b>edged</b> garden beds {{was created by}} Johnstone See Poy who was an enthusiastic gardener, and was also the setting for many family and community activities that gave it a profile in the community. Most of the See Poy residences on Edith Street became venues for community functions and social events, which reflected the family's standing within the community and their inclusive and multicultural approach to staffing See Poy & Sons. Their success and high social profile enabled them to play a leadership role within the Innisfail community and traverse racial boundaries. With Johnstone {{at the helm of}} See Poy & Sons, the firm participated in local sporting activities and events. This sustained sporting interest serves as yet another illustration of the family's involvement with mainstream Queensland community life. The firm sponsored its own cricket and tennis teams to compete against staff teams from other firms in the north. Although the firm did not field a football team, it donated a trophy, known as the See Poy Cup, for senior rugby league matches. Keeping pace with many businessmen, Johnstone and his brother-in-law, William Sue Yek, became members of the local golf club.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this study, to {{evaluate}} the bending performance and the shear performance of Aramid Fiber Plate Strip with enhanced attachment, 8 specimens were made for experiment. Most flexural failure specimens showed AFPS rip-off failure or separation failure. In the shear failure specimens, the specimens showed a brittle failure in which the <b>concrete</b> compression <b>edge</b> was broken. Compared with the control beam, the maximum ultimate strength increased by 164 ~ 193 % for the flexural failure specimen, and by 218 ~ 259 % for the shear failure specimen.

5|$|Further {{excavations}} were {{undertaken in}} the 1920s by C. R. Peers, who found that the nave of the original church had external doors on the north, south and west sides, and that the chancel had doors leading into {{the north and south}} porticus, which in turn had external doors on their eastern sides. Regarding the floor described by Dowker, Peers noted that the surface consisted of a thin layer of pounded brick, and believed that it was of the same date as the stone which Dowker described as the foundations for the stone cross. Excavations also revealed steps leading down to the burial vault reported by Dowker, although Peers did not refer to either the steps or the vault in his report. Extensions of the porticus to the west and around the original west front were dated to no more than 100years after the church was first built, and Peers observed that these extensions had been given the same type of floor as the original church. Drawing comparisons with the 7th-century chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall at Bradwell-on-Sea, in Essex, and the abbey of St Augustine at Canterbury, Peers suggested that the original church at Reculver probably had windows set high in the northern and southern walls of the nave.

40|$|Four two-thirds-scale {{reinforced}} <b>concrete</b> <b>edge</b> beam-column-slab subassemblies (two concentric and two eccentric connections) {{were tested}} under quasi-static cyclic lateral loading. Each subassembly represented a cruciform connection in an exterior moment-resisting frame with a monolithic floor slab {{on one side}} only, loaded in the longitudinal direction of the edge-beams. The tests explored the effect of eccentricity between beam and column centrelines, {{and the effect of}} floor slabs, on the structural performance of edge beam-column-slab connections subjected to earthquake loading. Performance of the specimens was evaluated in terms of overall strength and stiffness, energy dissipation, beam plastic hinge development, joint shear deformation, and joint shear strength. All specimens underwent some beam hinging at the beam/column interfaces. However, both eccentric specimens, and one concentric specimen with a heavily reinforced floor slab, eventually failed as a result of joint shear, whereas the other concentric specimen exhibited more ductile load-displacement response. The eccentric specimens (with different eccentricities and edge-beam widths) underwent similar behaviour before they started to break dawn, and they also reached similar joint shear strengths. Slab participation was evaluated using slab bar strain gauge data with respect to storey drift. Actual effective slab widths were much larger than the ones typically used in design, especially for the specimens with a column wider than the edge-beams. Finally, floor slabs imposed significant joint shear demand, but they also increased joint shear capacity by expanding effective joint width. open 111...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{standardize}} and simplify the design work on a few specific types of storage brackets for balconies. The company Balco AB had the wish to simplify the design work in the preparation of attachments to their balcony structures. This would be done by a calculation matrix that could be produced which then in turn could be used for each new project by the company. The design work behind the development of these fittings at each new project is costly both in terms of time devoted by each calculation but also the cost of the time. The {{purpose of this}} report is that in a systematic manner, a calculation matrix can be created that then the company instead may follow from each new project. In carrying out the project used HILTI calculation program, which was provided by the company HILTI. Balco AB operates in the current situation with this software when designing work related attachments are made. Determining of the calculation matrix was achieved by 896 different calculations were made on a total of 4 different types of consoles in HILTI computing applications.
