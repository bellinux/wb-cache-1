5|$|Towson United Methodist Church is in {{the midst}} of a $3million phased {{renovation}} and expansion project started in 2006. In the first phase, completed in 2007, an elevator and additional facilities were installed for improved disabled accessibility, along with a new fire sprinkler system and replacement of the building's <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> (HVAC). Additional classrooms in an expanded education wing are planned in future phases of a multiyear master plan adopted by the church in 2005.|$|E

Batch 7 introduced a transmission system to the command vehicle, and a data system giving instantaneous vision of the state of all battle tanks and acquired targets. It also incorporated minor improvements in the visor. Batch 8 was a modernisation of the electronic system, and Batch 9 replaced the thermal imaging ATHOS by a SAGEM Iris with better resolution.|$|E

25|$|After {{the demise}} of the Ninety-Eight in 1996, Oldsmobile added the Regency to the 1997 and 1998 lineups, which used the same front fenders and chrome grille as the Ninety-Eight sedan but kept the {{standard}} Eighty-Eight body. The Regency featured a long list of standard features including traction control, leather upholstery, dual 6-way power seats with power lumbar and a driver's side memory function, a dual-zone automatic <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> and an electronic level control for the rear suspension. A driver's side electrochromic outside mirror was also standard on the Regency, a feature that even Cadillac didn't offer as standard equipment. The interior day/night auto-dimming mirror was linked to the outside mirror and dimmed both with the same intensity at the same time. Some of these options, like the 2-driver memory feature, were not available on the Eighty-Eight Royale or LSS.|$|E

40|$|Range {{reduction}} {{caused by}} <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> is {{a barrier to}} widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EV). Higher efficiency and lower energy consumption by the air conditioning system will mitigate this disadvantage, as power consumption inside electric vehicles is a very relevant issue. Moreover, several European Union directives prohibit the use of HFC 134 a or any other fluorinated greenhouse gas with a Global Warming Potential (GWP) higher than 150 in new mobile air conditioning systems by January 2017. The Adoption of environmentally friendly refrigerants and minimizing the charge of refrigerant gas would be a viable option to endorse the EU directives. In this lecture, alternative <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> which profit from the advantages of thermochemical energy storage will be presented. In order to investigate the suitability of these systems for the high temperature fuel cell range extender vehicle (HTFCREX) developed by the DLR Institute of Vehicle Concepts, suitable <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> based {{on the use of}} hydrogen are developed, modeled and designed using the simulation environment Modelica/Dymola and the Air Conditioning Library.

50|$|In some museums, the <b>climate</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>system</b> in the {{galleries}} or entire {{architecture of the}} institution {{may need to be}} revamped or even replaced (depending on the age of the institution). A collections manager, or another employee from the collections department, should check to see what should be upgraded in the <b>climate</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>system</b> by walking around the museum and checking the status of the collection. It is their duty, along with the artifact conservators, to keep the collection safe. “Since there are over 8,000 different combinations of <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> design choices in the commercial marketplace today, it is a team process which can be divided into the three following steps: classify envelope, identify heat loads, and perform moisture inventory.” If a space is too warm, wooden instruments may warp.|$|R
40|$|Following a {{hot or cold}} thermal soak, vehicle <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> (air {{conditioning}} or heat) {{are required}} to quickly attain a cabin temperature comfortable to the vehicle occupants. In a plug-in hybrid electric or electric vehicle (PEV) equipped with electric <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> the traction battery is the sole on-board power source. Depleting the battery for immediate <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> results in reduced charge-depleting (CD) range and additional battery wear. PEV cabin and battery thermal preconditioning using off-board power supplied by the grid or a building can mitigate the impacts of <b>climate</b> <b>control.</b> This analysis shows that <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> loads can reduce CD range up to 35 %. However, cabin thermal preconditioning can increase CD range up to 19 % when compared to no thermal preconditioning. In addition, this analysis shows that while battery capacity loss over time is driven by ambient temperature rather than <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> loads, concurrent battery thermal preconditioning can reduce capacity loss up to 7 % by reducing pack temperature in a high ambient temperature scenario...|$|R
2500|$|The Eighty Eight {{was given}} a mild {{facelift}} in 1990, eschewing the former chromed grille for a body-colored fascia with four slots and the Oldsmobile Rocket logo. [...] In the rear, new taillights and backup lights extended across the body; once again, chrome trim was deleted. Minor revisions were also made to the interior. Part of the door panel was revised and 1990 also offered new cloth for the seats. The Pillow Cushion seats on the Brougham were deleted. A revised armrest console was also added, this one provided more room. As an option was a revised electronic <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> A new choice of alloy wheels was an option.|$|E

The CRT controlled the vehicle's <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and stereo, and also supplied advanced instrumentation such as a trip computer and maintenance reminder feature. Four-wheel disc brakes were standard. With a choice of three suspension packages available, up to the performance oriented FE3 setting, handling was notably improved.

2500|$|In 1939, Nash added a {{thermostat}} to its system, {{making it}} the first thermostatic automobile <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> [...] The Weather Eye [...] "was the first truly good heating and ventilating system." [...] Additionally, defoggers (defrosters) were incorporated {{with the introduction of}} the 3900 series cars that year. [...] The Nash HVAC system was designed by Nils Eric Wahlberg and it continues to be the basis for use in modern automobiles. Nash included the first automatic temperature control for the airside of the heating system with the thermostat sensing the temperatures of the incoming outside air, the heater's discharge, and interior of the car; so that a change in any of these three air temperatures resulted an automatic adjustment to maintain passenger comfort. [...] Nash's Conditioned Air System heater was now marketed as the [...] "Weather Eye" [...] and consumer sales literature explained that the thermostat's [...] "mechanical eye" [...] watched the weather, hence the name.|$|E

2500|$|In 1968 and 1969 Buick {{offered the}} GS 400 in a {{convertible}} and hardtop model. [...] Standard {{issue of the}} GS 400 was a 400 cubic inch (6.6L) engine (with likely lower stated horsepower rating to keep insurance premiums lower) of 340 horsepower (350hp stage 1 [...] ) and 440ft. lbs. torque, a four barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor, dual exhaust, 2.93 standard gear ratio optional ( [...] limited slip differential, (3.64 stage 1 option, 3.42 with A/C [...] ), and the available three speed turbo Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission (revered as the finest automatic transmission ever built, and commonly called Turbo Hydramatic 400), U-shape Hurst (automatic transmission) shifter and linkage, located on a center console. [...] A 1968 or 1969 GS400 equipped with the TH400 auto transmission was faster off the line than many of its contemporaries thanks to an unusually [...] "low" [...] 1st gear. Shift pattern for the TH400 from most forward position is Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Second, First. A standard 3 spd or optional 4 spd manual gearbox was also available. [...] Compression ratio on this engine was a very sensible 10.25:1, which allowed {{for the use of}} any grade gasoline to be used in normal driving without pinging. [...] The factory air cleaner was covered with a large round chromed cover, secured with a wing nut.
