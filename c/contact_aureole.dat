Greenschist facies phyllites have been elevated to the amphibolite facies and the regional strike of these country rocks has been disrupted by the intrusion, so that clear evidence is available of the time relationships. It is concluded that the kyanite crystallized {{as the result of}} ~he forceful intrusion of the granodiorite, probably under epizonal conditions. -~I-IE conditions under which kyanite crystallizes during metamor-phism are open to some dispute (see, for example, the symposium on depth and tectonics as factors in regional metamorphism, Proc.

Aguablanca, one of the largest Cu–Ni–PGE deposits in Europe, formed during the Variscan orogeny when a mafic magma intruded limestones and shales, creating a <b>contact</b> <b>aureole</b> composed of marble, skarn and hornfels. Our petrological and geochemical investigation of the aureole provides evidence that {{a combination of the two}} processes led to the formation of the ore deposit: The assimilation of terrigenous sediments supplied S to the magma while the assimilation of carbonates changed the oxygen fugacity and decreased the solubility of sulfur in the magma. The metamorphic assemblages in the <b>contact</b> <b>aureole</b> are directly related to heterogeneity of the protolith and particularly to the original proportions of calcite and clay. We modeled carbon dioxide degassing during contact metamorphism and showed that pure limestone is relatively unproductive because of its high reaction temperature.

Quartz microfabrics indicate that the dynamic crystallization processes progressively changed from grain boundary migration, associated with the thermal peak of contact metamorphism, to subgrain rotation and bulging recrystallization, the latter mostly associated with the cataclastic overprint.
