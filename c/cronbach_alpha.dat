30|$|The {{internal}} consistency reliability of the three scales in NUEPS was determined {{in the study by}} calculating the <b>Cronbach’s</b> <b>alpha</b> reliability coefficient for the above sample. The results in Table  2 indicate that the {{internal consistency}} reliability ranged from 0.91 to 0.95 for the three NUEPS scales. For the whole scale, the <b>Cronbach’s</b> <b>alpha</b> (α) value was 0.98, and the half-split reliability of the scale was 0.93. For the ‘STA’ sub-dimension, the <b>Cronbach’s</b> <b>alpha</b> (α) value was 0.95, with a half-split reliability of 0.93. For the ‘SRP’, the <b>Cronbach’s</b> <b>alpha</b> (α) value was 0.95, and the half-split reliability was 0.90. Finally, for the ‘LAPI’ sub-dimension, the <b>Cronbach’s</b> <b>alpha</b> (α) value was 0.92, and the half-split reliability was 0.90. Thus, the {{internal consistency reliability}} of the measures used in this study can be considered as favorable.|$|R

This investigation was to determine the cross-cultural suitability of the Condom Use Self Efficacy Scale (CUSES) originally developed for American adolescents and young adults by examining the structure and psychometric properties. Method A self-administered cross-sectional survey of a convenient sample of 511 participants from a private university in Ghana with mean age 21. 59 years. Result A Principal Component Analysis with varimax rotation identified a 14 item scale with four reliable factors labelled Appropriation (<b>Cronbach</b> <b>alpha</b> =. 85), Assertive (<b>Cronbach</b> <b>alpha</b> =. 90), Pleasure and Intoxicant (<b>Cronbach</b> <b>alpha</b> =. 83), and STDs (<b>Cronbach</b> <b>alpha</b> =. 81) that altogether explained 73. 72 % of the total variance. The scale correlated well with a measure of condom use at past sexual encounter (r =. 73), indicating evidence of construct and discriminatory validity. The factor loadings were similar to the original CUSES scale but not identical suggesting relevant cultural variations. Conclusion The 14 item scale (CUSES-G) is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing condom use self efficacy. It is culturally appropriate for use among Ghanaian youth to gauge actual condom use and to evaluate interventions meant to increase condom use. Finally, the study cautioned researchers against the use of the original CUSES without validation in African settings and contexts. </p...|$|E
