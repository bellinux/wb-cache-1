5|$|The Defective Premises Bill was {{introduced}} to the House of Commons as a private member's bill by Ivor Richard on 1 December 1971, and given the Royal Assent on 29 June 1972, <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>force</b> as the Defective Premises Act 1972 on 1 January 1974. The Act establishes a duty of care builders and their sub-contractors owe to the occupiers of property they construct or modify, and also establishes a duty of care landlords hold towards their tenants and any third parties who might be injured by their failure to maintain or repair property. The Act received a mixed reaction from critics; while some complimented it on its simple nature compared to the previously complex common rule laws, others felt that it was too limited for what was desired to be achieved, and that the wording used was at times both too vague and too specific.|$|E
5|$|In Slavonia, {{the first}} armed {{conflicts}} were clashes in Pakrac, and Borovo Selo near Vukovar. Western Slavonia was occupied in August 1991, following an advance by the Yugoslav forces north from Banja Luka across the Sava River. This was partially pushed {{back by the}} Croatian Army in operations named Otkos 10, and Orkan 91, which established a front line around Okučani and south of Pakrac that would hold virtually unchanged {{for more than three}} years until Operation Flash in May 1995. Armed conflict in the eastern Slavonia, culminating in the Battle of Vukovar and a subsequent massacre, also included heavy fighting and the successful defence of Osijek and Vinkovci. The front line stabilized and a ceasefire was agreed to on 2 January 1992, <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>force</b> the next day. After the ceasefire, United Nations Protection Force was deployed to the occupied areas, but intermittent artillery and rocket attacks, launched from Serb-held areas of Bosnia, continued in several areas of Slavonia, especially in Slavonski Brod and Županja. The war effectively ended in 1995 with Croatia achieving a decisive victory over the RSK in August 1995. The remaining occupied areas—eastern Slavonia—were restored to Croatia pursuant to the Erdut Agreement of November 1995, with the process concluded in mid-January 1998.|$|E

5|$|The Obscene Publications Act 1959 (c. 66) is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament that {{significantly}} reformed the law related to obscenity in England and Wales. Prior {{to the passage}} of the Act, the law on publishing obscene materials was governed by the common law case of R v Hicklin, which had no exceptions for artistic merit or the public good. During the 1950s, the Society of Authors formed a committee to recommend reform of the existing law, submitting a draft bill to the Home Office in February 1955. After several failed attempts to push a bill through Parliament, a committee finally succeeded in creating a viable bill, which was introduced to Parliament by Roy Jenkins and given the Royal Assent on 29 July 1959, <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>force</b> on 29 August 1959 as the Obscene Publications Act 1959. With the committee consisting of both censors and reformers, the actual reform of the law was limited, with several extensions to police powers included in the final version.|$|E
5|$|The Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 (c. 31) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} occupiers' liability. The {{result of the}} Third Report of the Law Reform Committee, the Act was {{introduced}} to Parliament as the Occupiers' Liability Bill and granted the Royal Assent on 6 June 1957, <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>force</b> on 1 January 1958. The Act unified several classes of visitors to property and the duty of care owed {{to them by the}} occupier, as well as codifying elements of the common law relating to this duty of care. It also covered the duty owed to parties to a contract entering the property and ways of excluding the liability for visitors. The Act introduced an element of liability for landlords who failed to maintain their properties and were as a result responsible for the injury of a non-tenant, something counter to the previous common law rule in English law. The Act is still valid law, and forms much of the law relating to occupiers' liability in English law along with the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.|$|E

40|$|Ocean-going {{ships are}} {{responsible}} for a large {{fraction of the total}} fuel consumption by transportation-related activities. Ships are the largest source of SO 2 emissions of all transportation modes and also emit large amounts of NOx and CO 2 (Eyring et al., 2010). Recent regulations enacted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are now aiming at reducing the maximum sulfur content in marine fuels from currently 4. 5 % down to 0. 5 % in 2020. More restrictive limits have been set for coastal shipping routes close to densely populated regions (IMO, 2009). In this study, we perform simulations with the global aerosol-climate model EMAC-MADE to analyze the impact of ship emissions on air quality. Here, we focus on particulate matter, which is known to have adverse effects on human health. We analyze different scenarios of low-sulfur fuel applications in shipping (Righi et al., 2011), including the use of biofuels, to estimate changes in the global and regional aerosol distributions. We find that regulations <b>coming</b> fully <b>into</b> <b>force</b> in 2020 and the consequent use of low-sulfur fuels in shipping lead to strong reductions in surface-level particle concentrations particularly along the most travelled routes. This would improve air quality near the coastlines of Northern Europe, the Western Pacific region and Southeast Asia significantly...|$|R

For the first two seasons of the show, Black worked for a mysterious consulting firm known as the Millennium Group. Black lived in Seattle with his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) and daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady). During the first season, Black and the Group largely focused on various serial killers and other murderers. However, during the second and third seasons, Black began <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> conflict with <b>forces</b> within the Millennium group that appeared to be demonic in nature.

Since centuries, women were confined to the home and were only responsible for doing domestic or non-paid work.

Although,women in Pakistan have worked in gendered academic institutions for long. But population expansion, advanced and professional education paved their way for employment into co-educational institutions. Where usually women were under-represented in universities, as inherently universities were masculine in nature. Moreover, the discourse of academic meritocracy may also be masculine and reproduce masculine practices, as the typical career path in academia is structured according to a male perception of success, which involves being research active, stay at work more than designated time and submit to the research assessment exercise. A work ethic grounded in long hours of conducting research, teaching, or writing papers were the norm in the “male” university (Brink et al. 2013; Remler and Perma 2009).|$|R
