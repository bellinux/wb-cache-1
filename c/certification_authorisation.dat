Practical {{experience with}} DIN ISO 9000 through to 9004 applied for <b>certification,</b> <b>authorisation,</b> validation; 2. The position of NDT in the quality management and assurance systems; 3. Progress {{in the development of}} NDT methods and instruments for quality assurance (eg. NDT and sorting of sintered metal parts using resonance methods; high-frequency ultrasonic wall thickness measurements; NDT of heterogenous CFRP structures; NDT of helicopter rotor blades; automated ultrasonic testing of circumferential pipe welds with the RNPS pipe weld testing system.) (orig. /CB) Dieser Band enthaelt 21 Beitraege zu folgenden Themenschwerpunkten: 1. Erfahrungen mit der DIN ISO 9000 bis 9004 bei der Zertifizierung, Akkreditierung und Validierung, 2. die Stellung der zerstoerungsfreien Pruefung im Qualitaetsmanagement und im System der Qualitaetsssicherung, und 3. Fortschritte bei der Entwicklung der Prueftechnik zur Qualitaetssicherung (z. B. ZfP und Sortieren von Sintermetallteilen durch das Resonanzverfahren; Ultraschall-Wanddickenmessung; Hubschrauber-Rotorblaetter-Pruefung; ZfP an heterogenen CFK-Strukturen; automatisierte Ultraschallpruefung von Rohrrundnaehten mit dem Rohrnaht-Pruefsystem RNPS) Available from TIB Hannover: RN 9938 (61) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEDEGerman...|$|E

In concrete, this technique is envisaged in the obligation of obtaining an authorization (lato sensu) in order to develop a certain activity or to use a product or service that is considered to attain an ecological risk, respectively the granting of permits, licences, <b>authorisations</b> or <b>certifications.</b> <b>Authorisation</b> (licensing) is based on the Environmental Impact Assessment, which is a constitutive part of the authorization process, as the conclusions of the environmental impact assessment study are conditioning the result of the authorization process. In order to attain a panoramic and complete reflection of the authorization as an environmental protection legal instrument, we consider to be highly useful the presentation of two transversal instruments, characterised of proactive operativity, a high degree of participation {{on the part of the}} involved subjects and a high level of environmental protection that they tend to attain. Basically, these two instruments are Environmental Impact Assessment and Strategic Environmental Assessment...|$|R

Content {{providers}} and distributors {{need to have}} secured and trusted systems for the distribution of multimedia content with Digital Rights Management (DRM) to ensure the revenues derived from their works. This paper discusses the security mechanisms applied {{to the implementation of}} a DRM architecture, regarding the certification and verification of user tools integrity during their whole life cycle, the mechanisms for providing a secure and trusted communication between client tools and the server framework for <b>authorisation,</b> <b>certification</b> or verification purposes, and the mechanisms for the secure storage and resynchronisation of the reports that describe the actions performed by users during the tool offline operation. The presented architecture is being implemented in the AXMEDIS project, which aims to create an innovative technology framework for the automatic production, protection and distribution of digital cross media contents over a range of different media channels, including PC (on the Internet), PDA, kiosks, mobile phones and i-TV...|$|R
