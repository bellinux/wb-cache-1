5|$|One of the {{earliest}} successes in the west was in controlling Icerya purchasi (<b>cottony</b> cushion scale) in Australia, using a predatory insect Rodolia cardinalis (the vedalia beetle). This success was repeated in California using the beetle and a parasitoidal fly, Cryptochaetum iceryae.|$|E
5|$|In some {{specimens}} of S.luteus, the partial veil separates from the stipe (rather than the cap margin), leaving <b>cottony</b> patches of veil {{hanging from the}} cap margin. In this state, fruit bodies can be confused with those of S.albidipes. Unlike S.luteus, however, S.albidipes does not have glandular dots on its stipe.|$|E
5|$|In their 1962 {{monograph}} on North American Calvatia, mycologists Sanford Myron Zeller and Alexander H. Smith set C.craniiformis as {{the type}} {{species of the}} stirps (a grouping of related species) Craniiformis, containing species with a large sterile base and a persistent <b>cottony</b> gleba. Other species they included in this stirps were C.umbrina, C.diguetti, C.lycoperdoides, C.rubroflava, C.ochrogleba, C.excipuliformis (since transferred by some authorities to Handkea), and C.elata.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria species form fleshy, white-spored {{mushrooms}} with a <b>cottony</b> or membranous veil {{that typically}} forms a distinct annulus on the stem. The fruit bodies usually occur in autumn in large clusters {{at the base}} of the stem or roots. Armillaria species can produce rhizomorphs—rootlike aggregations of hyphae—that can form massive, long-lasting underground networks. The growth of the rhizomorph networks allows for tree-to-tree spread of the fungus even when direct contact between diseased and healthy plants is not possible.|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{techniques}} {{as we know}} them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the <b>cottony</b> cushion scale, Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the <b>cottony</b> cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.|$|E
5|$|Grown on agar plates, the mycelia of A.serialiformis and A.serialis have {{identical}} chemical reactivity, and {{are rather}} similar in appearance, although the authors {{note that the}} former's was more <b>cottony</b> than the latter's. The authors mated several combinations of North American collections using vegetative compatibility tests, and confirmed the presence of different mating alleles—indicating {{that all of the}} North American collections represented a single species. Similar pairings performed between North American and European collections showed the species to be incompatible, and therefore distinct.|$|E
5|$|Several Suillus species which grow under pines {{could be}} {{confused}} with S.brevipes. S.granulatus has a longer stipe, and distinct raised granules on the stipe. S.brevipes is differentiated from S.albidipes by not having a <b>cottony</b> roll of velar tissue (derived from a partial veil) at the margin when young. S.pallidiceps is by distinguished its pale yellow cap color; and S.albivelatus has a veil. S.pungens has a characteristic pungent odor, compared to the mild smell of S.brevipes, and like S.granulatus, has glandular dots on the stipe.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta is a crustose lichen, {{because it}} {{grows in the}} form of a surface crust. The thallus, or body of the lichen is spread out flat and can be either tightly to loosely {{attached}} to the growing surface. It is 0.15–0.30mm thick, and can be smooth, or have low radiating ridges. The older, central region of the lichen surface has many reproductive structures called isidia; they resemble granules that are 0.1–0.4 by 0.1mm. The species relies entirely on vegetative means to reproduce, and is not known to have any sexual structures. From the center outwards, three color zones can be differentiated in mature specimens; the first grayish-green, the second white, and finally a bright red <b>cottony</b> rim.|$|E
5|$|Suillus spraguei is {{a species}} of fungus in the Suillaceae family. It is known {{by a variety of}} common names, {{including}} the painted slipperycap, the painted suillus or the red and yellow suillus. Suillus spraguei has had a complex taxonomical history, and is also frequently referred to Suillus pictus in the literature. The readily identifiable fruit bodies have caps that are dark red when fresh, dry to the touch, and covered with mats of hairs and scales that are separated by yellow cracks. On the underside of the cap are small, yellow, angular pores that become brownish as the mushroom ages. The stalk bears a grayish <b>cottony</b> ring, and is typically covered with soft hairs or scales.|$|E
5|$|The {{anamorphic}} form of P.semilanceata is an asexual {{stage in}} the fungus's life cycle involved {{in the development of}} mitotic diaspores (conidia). In culture, grown in a petri dish, the fungus forms a white to pale orange <b>cottony</b> or felt-like mat of mycelia. The conidia formed are straight to curved, measuring 2.0–8.0 by 1.1–2.0μm, and may contain one to several small intracellular droplets. Although little is known of the anamorphic stage of P.semilanceata beyond the confines of laboratory culture, in general, the morphology of the asexual structures may be used as classical characters in phylogenetic analyses to help understand the evolutionary relationships between related groups of fungi.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta is {{a species}} of lichen in the Arthoniaceae family of fungi. The species is {{distributed}} in subtropical and tropical locations throughout the southeastern United States, as well as Central and South America, and has been collected infrequently in a few locales in Africa. The body of the lichen forms continuous, circular crust-like patches on dead wood, readily recognizable by the prominent red pigment. The older, central region is covered with red, spherical to cylindrical granules. Moving outwards from the center, zones of color may be distinguished, the first gray-green, the second white, and finally a bright red <b>cottony</b> rim. The red and green colors of this unmistakable woodland lichen {{give the appearance of}} a Christmas wreath, suggestive of its common North American name, the Christmas wreath lichen. The red pigment, called chiodectonic acid is one of several chemicals the lichen produces to help tolerate inhospitable growing conditions.|$|E
5|$|Suillus intermedius, {{found in}} northeastern and {{northern}} North America, {{is similar in}} appearance to S.salmonicolor. It may be distinguished by a lighter-colored cap, cream to yellowish or pale ochraceous flesh, and a ring that is neither as thick nor as wide as S.salmonicolor. It is also larger, with a cap diameter of up to , and its pore surface sometimes slowly stains reddish-brown when bruised. Although {{it has not been}} definitively established whether S.cothurnatus is a distinct species, several characteristics have been reported to differentiate it from S.salmonicolor: a thinner, less rubbery veil that usually lacks a thickened <b>cottony</b> roll at the base; glandular dots on the stem that consist of bundles of multiseptate hyphae in a parallel arrangement ending in an even row of large, sterile cystidia (60–140μm long) that resemble basidia; and small hyaline cystidia shaped like swollen bottles with narrowed bases. Other Suillus species with which S.salmonicolor might be confused include S.acidus and S.subalutaceus. Both of these species have a less well-developed partial veil, and their flesh is a duller tone lacking yellow-orange tints.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} pest that {{attacked}} orange {{trees in the}} United States was the <b>cottony</b> cushion scale (Icerya purchasi), imported from Australia to California in 1868. Within 20 years, it wiped out the citrus orchards around Los Angeles, and limited orange growth throughout California. In 1888, the USDA sent Alfred Koebele to Australia to study this scale insect in its native habitat. He brought back with him specimens of Novius cardinalis, an Australian ladybird beetle, and within a decade the pest was controlled.|$|E
25|$|During {{the history}} of slavery in the United States, most African Americans styled their hair {{in an attempt to}} mimic the styles of the {{predominantly}} white society in which they lived. Afro-textured hair, characterized by its tight kinks, has been described as being kinky, coarse, <b>cottony,</b> nappy, or woolly. These characteristics represented the antithesis of the European American standard of beauty, and led to a negative view of kinky hair. As a result, the practice of straightening gained popularity among African Americans.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} generalist aphid and scale predators and {{incidental}} substances of botanical origin, many Coccinellidae do favour or even specialise in certain prey types. This makes {{some of them}} particularly valuable as agents in biological control programmes. Determination of specialisation {{need not be a}} trivial matter, though; for example the larva of the Vedalia ladybird Rodolia cardinalis is a specialist predator on a few species of Monophlebidae, in particular Icerya purchasi, which is the most notorious of the <b>cottony</b> cushion scale species. However, the adult R. cardinalis can subsist for some months on a wider range of insects plus some nectar.|$|E
25|$|One popular {{version of}} these systems classifies afro-textured hair as 'type 4' (straight hair is type 1, wavy type 2, and curly is type 3, with the letters A, B, and C used to {{indicate}} the degree of coil variation within each type), with the subcategory of type 4C being most exemplary of this hair type (Walker, 1997). However, afro-textured hair {{is often difficult to}} categorize because of the many different variations among individuals. Those variations include pattern (mainly tight coils), pattern size (watch spring to chalk), density (sparse to dense), strand diameter (fine, medium, coarse), and feel (<b>cottony,</b> wooly, spongy).|$|E
25|$|This species resembles Papilio palinurus, but {{the male}} {{generally}} has, on the upperside {{of the outer}} half of the forewing, <b>cottony</b> or hairy scent-streaks {{similar to those in}} Papilio polyctor, only the streak in interspace 1 is always missing. Other differences are seen in the upper wing. The forewing has the discal transverse bluish-green band slightly sinuous, narrower, more curved than in P. palinurus and more distinctly decreasing in width towards the costal margin; in the female it is more sinuous than in the male. The hindwing has the transverse bluish-green band very variable in width but the inner margin is much straighter than in P. polyctor; this band that in P. polyctor stops short of vein 7, continues to the costal margin, it is however much and abruptly narrowed above vein 7; tornal ocellus claret-red with a large black centre inwardly edged with blue; the bright ochraceous subapical lunule of P. polyctor replaced by a dull whitish spot; the subterminal diffuse green lunules restricted to interspaces 2,3 and 4; the spatular apex of the tail with a small patch of bluish-green scales.|$|E

It is white in colour, with flat grey hairs, often in a zig-zag pattern. It does not bear a ring and has fragile, <b>cottony,</b> brownish or charcoal-coloured oblique girdles of volval remnants around the stem base and lower stem. The volva is white to grey, powdery and delicate. The flesh is white and does not change colour when cut. Although it lacks any distinctive odor, it tastes sweet.|$|E
500|$|Amanita ceciliae is {{characterized}} by bearing a large fruit body with a brown cap [...] across. The cap has charcoal-grey patches, which are easily removable.

500|$|The white stem {{measures}} [...] long by [...] thick, and {{is roughly}} the same width throughout its length, although {{it can be a}} bit thicker near the base. Its surface is dry and smooth, sometimes marked by faint longitudinal grooves. It is either stuffed (filled with a <b>cottony</b> pith) or partially hollow, and lacks a ring or partial veil.|$|E
500|$|The fungus Lactifluus pseudodeceptivus is {{very similar}} to L.deceptivus in its {{external}} appearance, but it has spore ornamentation that forms a reticulum, and its stem is an [...] (a gelatinous layer of hyphae lying parallel to the surface). L.caeruleitinctus is also similar in appearance, but it has a milky-white stem with blue tints that develops more intense blue coloration after handling, and it lacks a <b>cottony,</b> inrolled margin. Other lookalike species include Lactarius arcuatus, which has a much smaller cap and smaller spores, and Lactariusparvulus, which has a small, [...] cap. Russula brevipes and R.angustispora are also somewhat similar in appearance, but they do not produce latex when cut or injured. Lactifluus subvellereus var. subdistans has more widely spaced gills, and an even cap margin. Lactifluus piperatus has densely crowded gills, a firm rather than soft and <b>cottony</b> cap margin, and exceedingly acrid latex.|$|E
500|$|The cap is {{typically}} between [...] in diameter, broadly convex {{with a small}} umbo (a central elevation) to flat with age. The cap margin is curved inwards in young specimens, and may have remnants of a yellowish, <b>cottony</b> veil hanging from it. The cap surface is colored bright yellow with red or brownish streaks and hairy patches. When the fruit body is young and moist, the surface is slimy; as the cap matures and dries out, it becomes sticky or tacky.|$|E
500|$|The stem is [...] long, [...] thick, {{and roughly}} equal in width throughout. Its surface is sticky and glutinous when fresh, {{somewhat}} scurfy near the apex (covered with loose scales) but smooth below. It is pale yellow to yellow {{down to the}} base, which is sheathed with a <b>cottony</b> white mycelium. The stem can be either solid or hollow. The mushroom lacks a partial veil and a ring. The spore print is olive-brown. The mushroom is edible, but not appealing.|$|E
500|$|For a tree {{seedling}} to {{grow into}} an adult tree it needs light and space. If seeds only fell straight to the ground, competition among the concentrated saplings and {{the shade of the}} parent would likely prevent it from flourishing. Many seeds such as birch are small and have papery wings to aid dispersal by the wind. Ash trees and maples have larger seeds with blade shaped wings which spiral down to the ground when released. The kapok tree has <b>cottony</b> threads to catch the breeze.|$|E
500|$|When {{the fruit}} bodies are young, the {{underside}} of the caps have a <b>cottony</b> layer of tissue stretching {{from the edge of the}} cap to the stem—a partial veil—which serves to protect the developing gills. As the cap grows in size the membrane is eventually pulled away from the cap to expose the gills. The gills have an adnate (squarely attached) to somewhat decurrent (extending down the length of the stem) attachment to the stem. They are initially white, but age to a creamy or pale orange covered with rust-colored spots. The stem is [...] long and [...] thick, and almost club-shaped with the base up to [...] thick. Above the level of the ring, the stem is pale orange to brown, while below it is whitish or pale pink, becoming grayish-brown at the base. The ring is positioned about [...] below the level of the cap, and may be covered with yellowish to pale-brownish woolly <b>cottony</b> mycelia. The base of the stem is attached to rhizomorphs, black root-like structures 1–3mm in diameter. While the primary function of the below-ground mycelia is to absorb nutrients from the soil, the rhizomorphs serve a more exploratory function, to locate new food bases.|$|E
500|$|The gills are {{of varying}} lengths. They are {{free from the}} stipe and vary from crowded to widely spaced. They may be narrow or broad and are white to creamy yellow in color. The stipe is white and is [...] long and [...] wide. In some specimens, the stipe bruises to a yellow color. It is either hollow or lightly stuffed with a <b>cottony</b> tissue. The bulb at the base is {{slightly}} broader {{than the rest of}} the stipe. The bulb is [...] long and [...] wide. A shaggy, drooping ring is present which is often shed before maturity.|$|E
500|$|... fruits in spring, often under snow, {{and early}} summer {{toward the end of}} the {{snowmelt}} period in high mountain forests. Fruit bodies appear similar to unopened mushrooms, measuring [...] tall with [...] diameter caps that are whitish to brownish. They have a short but distinct whitish stipe that extend through the internal spore mass (gleba) of the fruit body into the cap. The gleba consists of irregular chambers made of contorted gills that are brownish in color. A whitish, <b>cottony</b> partial veil is present in young specimens, but it often disappears in age and does not leave a ring on the stipe.|$|E
500|$|According to Singer, the [...] {{species is}} often mistaken for A.verna {{in the eastern}} United States. A.verna, however, has {{ellipsoid}} spores. Other white amanitas {{within the range of}} A.aestivalis include the deadly toxic species A.virosa (has a more loose <b>cottony</b> stem), A.phalloides (the cap usually has an olive-green tint) and A.bisporigera (typically has two-spored basidia). A.aestivalis is sometimes considered a white form of A.brunnescens, but this latter species has dusky brownish gray radial stripes and usually has many fibrils (short section of hyphae) projecting from the surface, to produce a fine, hairy appearance. Further, it stains more rapidly than A.aestivalis. A.asteropus (the [...] "European star-footed Amanita") is cream to yellow color, and differs from A.aestivalis in its reaction to chemical tests. It is only known from Europe.|$|E
500|$|The {{closely related}} species Verpa conica {{typically}} has a smooth cap, although specimens with wrinkled caps are known. V.conica may be distinguished microscopically by its eight-spored asci. Its North American range extends much further south than V.bohemica. Another similar group of species are the [...] "half-free" [...] morels, Morchella semilibera and others, which have a honeycombed cap that {{is attached to the}} stalk for about half of its length, and with ridges that are darker than the pits. Additionally, a cross-sectioned stem of a specimen of M.semilibera is hollow, while V.bohemica usually has <b>cottony</b> wisps in the stem, and M.semilibera usually has vertical perforations near the base, while V.bohemica lacks them. Verpa bohemica may be reliably distinguished from all similar species by its much larger spores.|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} B.edulis can be {{infected}} by the parasitic mould-like fungus Hypomyces chrysospermus, {{known as the}} bolete eater, which manifests itself as a white, yellow, or reddish-brown <b>cottony</b> layer {{over the surface of}} the mushroom. Some reported cases of stomach ache following consumption of dried porcini have been attributed to the presence of this mould on the fruit bodies. The mushroom is also used as a food source by several species of mushroom flies, as well as other insects and their larvae. An unidentified species of virus was reported to have infected specimens found in the Netherlands and in Italy; fruit bodies affected by the virus had relatively thick stems and small or no caps, leading to the name [...] "little-cap disease".|$|E
500|$|Pulveroboletus ravenelii, {{commonly}} known as Ravenel's bolete or the powdery sulfur bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. Described as new to science in 1853, the widely distributed species is known from Asia, Australia, North America, Central America, and South America. Mycorrhizal with oak, the fungus fruits on the ground singly, scattered, or in groups in woods. Fruit bodies (mushrooms) have convex to flat, yellowish to brownish-red caps up to [...] in diameter. On the cap underside, the pore surface is bright yellow before turning dingy yellow to grayish brown with age; it stains greenish blue then grayish brown after injury. A <b>cottony</b> and powdery partial veil remains as a ring on the stipe. The mushrooms are edible, and {{have been used in}} traditional Chinese medicine and for mushroom dyeing.|$|E
500|$|Field {{characteristics}} used {{to identify}} Pycnoporellus alboluteus include its orange color, toothlike pore edges, and the soft texture of its flesh. Other reddish-colored polypores with which Pycnoporellus alboluteus can be confused include Polyporus alboluteus, P.fibrillosus, and P.cinnabarinus. [...] They can be distinguished {{by the size of}} their pores: P.alboluteus has pores that measure 1–3mm, those of P.fibrillosus are 1–2 per mm, while those of P.cinnabarinus are 2–4 per mm. The shelf-like fruit bodies of Pycnoporellus fulgens have distinct caps, smaller pores measuring 0.3–0.5mm, and less tendency to be pulled away from the substrate in sheets. Oligoporus leucospongia is another snowbank fungus that prefers downed conifer logs. It can be distinguished from P.alboluteus [...] by its whitish <b>cottony</b> upper surface. Another orange fungus, Ceriporia spissa, is tightly appressed to the wood substrate, with a soft, gelatinous body texture.|$|E
500|$|The cap of this fungus (known {{technically}} as an apothecium) is [...] {{in diameter}} by [...] long, with a conical or bell shape. It is folded into longitudinal ridges that often fuse together (anastomose) in a vein-like network. The cap {{is attached to}} the stem at the top only—hanging {{from the top of the}} stipe, with the lobed edge free from the stem—and varies in color from yellowish brown to reddish brown; the underside of the cap is pale. The stem is [...] long by [...] thick, cream-white in color, and tapers upward so that the stem is thicker at the base than at the top. Although the stem is initially loosely stuffed with <b>cottony</b> hyphae, it eventually becomes hollow in maturity; overall, the mushroom is rather fragile. The spore deposit is yellow, and the flesh is white.|$|E
500|$|Young fruit {{bodies of}} H.bakerensis have rounded caps with <b>cottony</b> margins that are rolled inward; as the {{mushrooms}} mature the caps flatten {{out and the}} margins may lift upward. The diameter of the cap reaches between [...] The center of the cap is colored yellow-brown, tawny or amber, reducing to nearly white at the margin. The cap surface is slimy when wet, and sticky as it gets older and dries out. Beneath the slime layer are hairs that are plastered tightly to the surface, which clump together a few {{at a time to}} form many little streaks. The firm white flesh of the cap is thick— near the stem attachment—and tapers evenly to the margin. It does not change color when cut or bruised. It has a mild taste and a characteristic fragrant odor that resembles almonds, or [...] "crushed peach pits". The waxy gills are decurrent or bluntly attached to the stem. The gill spacing is close to subdistant—between 56–88 individual gills reach the stem, with 2–3 tiers of short lamellulae (shorter gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem). The gills have even edges, and are narrow but become broad in large caps (8–12mm), ranging in color from creamy white to pinkish-buff. They do not discolor when they are bruised. Young specimens often have drops of a clear liquid beaded on the gills. The gills of dried specimens darken considerably. The stem is [...] long, [...] thick at the apex, solid (i.e., not hollow), and either equal in width throughout or narrowed downward. Its color is white to pale pinkish-buff, with a dry surface. The top portion of young specimens have a <b>cottony,</b> fine whitish powder near the top, but this sloughs off as it matures. Like the gills, the top of the stem is often beaded with drops of translucent liquid in moist weather.|$|E
500|$|Amanita ceciliae, {{commonly}} called snakeskin grisette and strangulated amanita, is a basidiomycete fungus in the genus Amanita. First described in 1854 by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome, {{it was given}} its current name by Cornelis Bas in 1984. It is characterized by bearing a large fruit body with a brown cap [...] across. The cap has charcoal-grey patches, which are easily removable. The stipe is [...] long, white in colour, {{and there is no}} ring on it. It is slightly tapered to the top, and has irregular <b>cottony</b> bands girdling the base. The universal veil is grey. Spores are white, spherical in shape, non-amyloid, and measure 10.2–11.7 micrometres. The mushrooms are considered edible, but field guides typically advise caution in selecting them for consumption, due to risks of confusion with similar toxic species. A.ceciliae is found in woods throughout Europe and North America, where it fruits during summer and autumn.|$|E
500|$|The cap is [...] in diameter, {{initially}} convex, but becomes funnel-shaped in age. The margin (cap edge) is rolled inwards and <b>cottony</b> when young, concealing the immature gills.
