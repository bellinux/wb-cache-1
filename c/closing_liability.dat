SCF and FFA comparisons have proved difficult in the past, and previous research has not fully adjusted for definitional differences between the FFA and the SCF. This analysis addresses common misperceptions about the definitions of the FFA's {{assets and liabilities}} and describes the reconciliations between the FFA and SCF measures. The results show that for some asset and liability categories the SCF and FFA estimates are quite <b>close.</b> Measures of <b>liabilities,</b> however, match up better than those for assets.

Recently, {{the law in}} New Zealand has begun to depart from English law, and move <b>closer</b> to strict <b>liability.</b> Parliament has responded with a ‘safe harbour’ in clause 20 of the Harmful Digital Communications Bill, which will provide online content hosts with conditional immunity from liability for content created by others. The author supports {{the creation of a}} legislative safe harbour for internet intermediaries, but highlights a number of deficiencies with clause 20 as currently drafted. This paper analyses the existing law, including possible defences, and clause 20. It also looks to other jurisdictions’ safe harbours, and concludes with recommendations on how clause 20 ought to be improved...|$|R
40|$|Liability {{coverage}} for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is {{of paramount importance}} if the industry is going to mature and develop {{in a way that will}} allow it to make a significant contribution to mitigating climate change. Liability for CCS can be broken into two phases – short-term, which covers the pre-injection, injection, and closure stages of the project, and long-term, which covers the post-closure stage. Since pre-injection, injection, and closure occur over a relatively short period of time that may cover 20 - 30 years, typical liability instruments like private insurance, letters of credit, performance bonds, trust funds, and escrow accounts may be utilized. For the post-closure phase, which lasts indefinitely after the site has been <b>closed,</b> more enduring <b>liability</b> instruments must be used in order to ensure that adequate and long-lasting coverage is provided. Several states have created liability schemes to cover long-term liability, but most of these schemes are incomplete and may lead to confusion over who is responsible for damages and remediation if they are utilized. This paper discusses possible liability schemes, critically analyzes those schemes currently in place, and proposes the best possible choice for long-term coverage of geological sequestration...|$|R
50|$|In 1919 he {{purchased}} a South London business which he renamed the Wallington Motor Company. In addition to making parts for gas stoves, it bought, sold, hired and repaired bicycles {{as well as}} the occasional automobile. Demand for motor cars in England {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the war was far greater than the supply and Hartnett increased the automotive side of his new venture by instructing his employees to make inquiries in nearby villages with a view to locating war widows who couldn’t drive but whose husbands prior to enlisting had left their cars up on blocks to await their owners’ return. He would offer to buy these vehicles, which often needed work done to make them roadworthy, with a view to repairing and reselling them at Wallington Motors. Initially, he was very successful. But then the bubble burst as the economy slowed and motor cars became harder to sell. Already in September 1920, the Wallington Motor Company was forced to take out a £200 bank loan to remain afloat. Three months later, a further £600 was borrowed. Even so, the venture was unable to meet its <b>liabilities,</b> <b>closing</b> its doors for the last time in December 1921.|$|R
40|$|This work {{proposes a}} new copula class {{that we call}} the MGB 2 copula. The new copula {{originates}} from extracting the dependence function of the multivariate GB 2 distribution (MGB 2) whose marginals follow the univariate generalized beta distribution of the second kind (GB 2). The MGB 2 copula can capture non-elliptical and asymmetric dependencies among marginal coordinates and provides a simple formulation for multi-dimensional applications. This new class features positive tail dependence in the upper tail and tail independence in the lower tail. Furthermore, it includes some well-known copula classes, such as the Gaussian copula, as special or limiting cases. To illustrate {{the usefulness of the}} MGB 2 copula, we build a trivariate MGB 2 copula model of bodily injury <b>liability</b> <b>closed</b> claims. Extended GB 2 distributions are chosen to accommodate the right-skewness and the long-tailedness of the outcome variables. For the regression component, location parameters with continuous predictors are introduced using a nonlinear additive function. For comparison purposes, we also consider the Gumbel and t copulas, alternatives that capture the upper tail dependence. The paper introduces a conditional plot graphical tool for assessing the validation of the MGB 2 copula. Quantitative and graphical assessment of the goodness of fit demonstrate the advantages of the MGB 2 copula over the other copulas.

First, all non-resident parents, even those on very low incomes, on unemployment benefits and the like, have been deemed liable to contribute at a minimum rate of $ 5 per week. Second, some loopholes created by manipulating taxable income in order to minimise child support payments have been <b>closed.</b> Third, the <b>liability</b> of non-resident parents for the financial support of children has been reduced in cases where there are second family responsibilities, and where the resident parent earns more than $ 29, 598. Fourth, parents are encouraged, and even required, to move off the scheme where collection appears reliable. The debate Aspects of the child support debate which captured the media headlines centred on what {{was considered to be}} the unfair demands for financial support from non-resident parents. The changes in the formula for assessing child support liability just announced have shifted the fulcrum so that more financial onus now falls on resident parents. Most of the reported comment has been to the effect that this is too little change and that unfair hardship continues to weigh on non-resident parents. Media reports indicated that the Government Backbench Committee on Child Support advocated much more sweeping changes which would shift the financial responsibility even further towards the resident parent.

40|$|On 23 October 2013 the Supreme Court <b>closed</b> another vicarious <b>liability</b> {{loophole}} when it {{handed down}} its judgment in Woodland. The respondent education authority {{was set to}} escape any potential liability for a negligently conducted swimming lesson simply because the lesson had been carried out by an independent contractor, rather than an employee. For this reason, both parties agreed that the respondent could not be vicariously liable, yet to deny the claimant any possibility of seeking compensation from the authority for the incident on that basis would have been unpalatable. Accordingly, the court kept the education authority in the frame by endorsing and expounding a concept little-used in English law but supported by some powerful dicta: the non-delegable duty of care. In contrast to vicarious liability, the non-delegable duty is a personal one, which requires a defendant not merely to take reasonable care, but to ensure that reasonable care is taken; a task may be delegated to an independent contractor, but the duty may not. The Supreme Court explained that a non-delegable duty would arise where: (1) the claimant is especially vulnerable or dependent on the defendant's protection against risk of injury; (2) there is an antecedent {{relationship between the two}} which puts the claimant in the defendant's custody, charge or care and from which it is possible to say that the defendant has assumed a duty to ensure care is taken; (3) the claimant has no control over how the defendant chooses to perform its obligations; (4) the defendant has delegated a function which {{is an integral part of}} the positive duty it assumed, such that the delegate now exercises custody, charge or care over the claimant on the defendant's behalf; and (5) the defendant has delegated its duty to a third party, who has performed it negligently. Reversing the decision of the lower courts and remitting the case for trial, the Supreme Court unanimously decided that the education authority owed the claimant a non-delegable duty, which could give rise to liability for any negligence in this case. Following Woodland, it is now clear that, when exercising their core functions, schools, hospitals and other similar organisations will owe personal, non-delegable duties towards those persons entrusted into their custody, charge or care. In such cases, claimants who suffer loss by reason of the negligent performance of the defendant's core functions will be entitled to seek redress from the defendant by an alternative route, where they cannot establish vicarious liability. Against the backdrop of a climate where outsourcing is now common place, this judgment is a particularly pertinent one and its practical implications will need to be factored into operational decision-making. However, any objections from potential defendants are easily outweighed by the policy justifications for closing this particular loophole...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis is devoted to the study of an Affine Term Structure Model (ATSM) where we use Wishart-like {{processes}} to model the stochastic variance-covariance of interest rates. This work was initially motivated by some thoughts on calibration and model risk in hedging interest rates derivatives. The ambition of our work is to build a model which reduces as much as possible the noise coming from daily re-calibration of the model to the market. It is standard market practice to hedge interest rates derivatives using models with parameters that are calibrated on a daily basis to fit the market prices of a set of well chosen instruments (typically the instrument that will be used to hedge the derivative). The model assumes that the parameters are constant, and the model price is based on this assumption; however since these parameters are re-calibrated, they become in fact stochastic. Therefore, calibration introduces some additional terms in the price dynamics (precisely in the drift term of the dynamics) which can lead to poor P&L explain, and mishedging. The initial idea of our research work is to replace the parameters by factors, and assume a dynamics for these factors, and assume that all the parameters involved in the model are constant. Instead of calibrating the parameters to the market, we fit the value of the factors to the observed market prices. A large part of this work has been devoted to the development of an efficient numerical framework to implement the model. We study second order discretization schemes for Monte Carlo simulation of the model. We also study efficient methods for pricing vanilla instru- ments such as swaptions and caplets. In particular, we investigate expansion techniques for prices and volatility of caplets and swaptions. The arguments that we use to obtain the expansion rely on an expansion of the infinitesimal generator with respect to a perturbation factor. Finally we have studied the calibration problem. As mentioned before, the idea of the model we study in this thesis is to keep the parameters of the model constant, and calibrate the values of the factors to fit the market. In particular, we need to calibrate the initial values (or the variations) of the Wishart-like process to fit the market, which introduces a positive semidefinite constraint in the optimization problem. Semidefinite programming (SDP) gives a natural framework to handle this constraint. The second part of this thesis presents some of the work I have done on the hedging of interest rate risk in ALM. This work was motivated by the business at Cr ́edit Agricole S. A. and in particular by the Financial Division of the bank. The purpose of this part of the dis- sertation is twofold. First we want to communicate on a field of Finance which is less known by the mathematical finance community, and presents some interesting modeling challenges. Secondly we try to present an original approach to modeling and hedging interest rate risk. Chapter 6 is an attempt to formalize some of concepts that are used in practice in ALM. We recall some of the key concepts such as the schedule of an asset or a liability and the interest rate gap, and introduce a new concept : the notion of envelope. This concept will look familiar to people used to derivatives pricing, and the hedging of the interest rate riskof an asset or a <b>liability</b> (<b>closing</b> the gap using the language of ALM) is very similar to the hedging of an option. The remaining chapters present the results of the work we have done in three different projects. Ce mémoire présente une partie du travail de recherche que j’ai effectué dans le cadre de ma thèse. Ce travail a été principalement effectué durant ma permanence au Groupe de Recherche Opérationnelle du Crédit Agricole. Etant donné le contexte dans lequel j’ai conduit mon travail de thèse, celui-ci a été principalement inspiré, et parfois meme directement motive par les besoins concrets des équipes opérationnelles.
