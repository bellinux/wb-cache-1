25|$|Paul Shoup is {{considered}} the founder of Los Altos because of his personal and professional contributions to the ongoing economic health of the fledgling settlement. Beginning in 1907, Paul and several business associates formed the Altos Land Company to develop the former Winchester and Merriman ranches as a residential enclave along the Southern Pacific Railroad’s Los Gatos cutoff, then under construction. This rail line would allow residents to have a direct rail connection to both San Jose (30 minutes) and San Francisco (60 minutes). Paul sold {{his interest in the}} company only to buy back the company in 1913 to prevent it from going into bankruptcy. Beyond this direct involvement, he played a large role in bringing businesses and people to the town. It was his business connections through his roles at Southern Pacific and his involvement in the influential social clubs of the time that gave legitimacy to the enterprise, drawing in an influential and well-heeled group of early residents to bring his vision of a bucolic residential <b>commuter</b> <b>community</b> to light.|$|E
25|$|Squamish {{is a minor}} {{deepwater}} port. It was {{the original}} southern terminus of the BCR {{in the days when}} it was the Pacific Great Eastern, and had a busy ferry terminal where travellers would disembark from ferries and steamers bringing them in from Vancouver harbour. In the 1960s what was then called the Squamish Highway was finally pushed through from Vancouver. This made the former steamer service unnecessary. Once a thriving forestry town, with recent cutbacks in logging along with the closure and dismantling of a major sawmill in 2004, Squamish has become a tourist destination and a <b>commuter</b> <b>community</b> for workers in nearby Whistler and Vancouver. The recent closure of the Woodfibre pulp mill in 2006 signals an end to the resource based economy here. Squamish is a world centre for rock climbing, with the 1500' bulk of the Stawamus Chief, a huge rock formation always busy with climbers, along with other formations overlooking downtown and the head of Howe Sound. In addition,the strong winds and flat waters at the upper end of Howe Sound have made Squamish a mecca for windsurfers, kite boarders and keelboat sailors.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond Southern Pacific, Paul Shoup {{was very}} active in other social and {{business}} interests. Early in his career these interests focused {{on the development of}} Los Altos as a residential <b>commuter</b> <b>community.</b> He became {{a founding member of the}} San Jose Chamber of Commerce and worked to promote the Santa Clara Valley as an ideal place to live and establish business interests. He joined all the influential social clubs of the time, including the Pacific Union Club and the Bohemian Club in San Francisco, as well as the Bankers Club in New York. In 1924, during a Bohemian Club meeting, Herbert Hoover urged ...|$|E

40|$|Support {{for local}} open space ballot {{initiatives}} in the American West is surprising, given that federal land conservation legislation {{tends to be}} lightning rod issues. The central focus {{of this study is}} to explore the extent to which the New West-Old West concept explains varying levels of support for local land conservation initiatives. Principal component analysis is used to obtain orthogonal variables of regionally relevant data on population, housing, and occupation/industry. Weighted Least Squares Regression is used to regress the factor analysis variables and population migration variables onto percent voting ‘yes’ for open space initiative. All community variables are significant predictors of levels of support: affluent communities, Old West <b>communities,</b> <b>commuter</b> <b>communities,</b> communities with decennial population increases, communities with non-Western state in-migration, and communities with farm population losses. What explains varying levels of support is not the polarized New West-Old West concept but, rather, a nuanced conception of the changing American West.

50|$|A {{result of}} its unincorporated status before 1996, Lower Sackville and {{adjacent}} unincorporated communities such as Middle Sackville and Upper Sackville did not benefit from appropriate planning and are examples of urban sprawl. The community's growth reflects its central location, near both Halifax and Dartmouth, with easy access to Highway 102, Highway 101 and Halifax Stanfield International Airport. Proximity to downtown Halifax and Burnside and Bayers Lake Industrial Parks gives the suburbs of Lower Sackville the advantages of employment opportunities and services of a larger city, and is typical of most <b>commuter</b> <b>communities</b> experiencing growth in North America.|$|R
50|$|The school {{legislation}} greatly {{fueled the}} borough craze in Bergen County. Wealthy communities that had {{had their own}} school districts now faced the prospect of sharing their school tax revenues with poorer areas, or of being divided up piecemeal in borough referenda. Allendale broke away, principally from Franklin Township, because of such fears. At 650 people, Allendale {{was one of the}} more populous boroughs formed in 1894. In such <b>commuter</b> <b>communities</b> as Park Ridge, those new residents often led the borough drives against the opposition of the old inhabitants who feared the improvements would not benefit them and that the new borough would quickly incur debt through issuance of municipal bonds.|$|R

50|$|In 2001 {{nearly a}} third of all {{properties}} in Gwynedd were bought by buyers from out of the county, and with some communities reporting as many as a third of local homes used as holiday homes. Holiday home owners spend less than {{six months of the year}} in the local community. Additional concern was expressed by Cymuned, which included disillusioned Plaid Cymru members, when it was pointed out that real-estate in North Wales was specifically marketed to affluent buyers in England rather than marketed to locals. These growing dormitory towns along the North Wales Expressway serve more as <b>commuter</b> <b>communities</b> for Chester and other cross-border cities, effectively driving-out Welsh-speaking communities, activists pointed out.|$|R
50|$|Market {{segmentation}} has principally {{focused on}} the business travel market. The French original focus on business travelers is reflected by the early design of the TGV trains. Pleasure travel was a secondary market; now many of the French extensions connect with vacation beaches on the Atlantic and Mediterranean, as well as major amusement parks and also the ski resorts in France and Switzerland. Friday evenings are the peak time for TGVs (train à grande vitesse). The system lowered prices on long distance travel to compete more effectively with air services, {{and as a result}} some cities within an hour of Paris by TGV have become <b>commuter</b> <b>communities,</b> increasing the market while restructuring land use.|$|R
40|$|The {{story of}} suburbs in America sweeps {{in much of}} this country’s modern history of {{sprawling}} land use and the self-segregation of affluent and middle class <b>commuter</b> <b>communities.</b> This panel will explore {{the current state of}} the suburbs and ask whether the infrastructure that supports a commuter economy is compatible with changing demographics. Who lives in the suburbs, and who speaks for them in local government? Are the children of lower income communities further disadvantaged in terms of income mobility by virtue of living in the suburbs? What problems arise when affordable housing is located in areas with poor public transportation and few job opportunities? Are poor people being pushed out of urban areas? If so, is greater urban density a more desirable policy option than bringing transportation services to the suburbs...|$|R

40|$|The {{search for}} engines to power rural {{economic}} growth has gone {{beyond the traditional}} boundaries {{of the food and}} fiber sector to industries such as tourism and to schemes such as attracting metropolitan workers to <b>commuter</b> <b>communities</b> with rural amenities. A group that has been somewhat overlooked is retirees, who may wish to trade in urban or suburban life-styles for a more peaceful rural retirement. An industry that has been neglected is the health care industry, which is the most rapidly growing industry nationally and of particular interest to retirees and aging populations. This paper examines the importance of rural health care services in attracting migrants age 65 + to rural counties in Michigan. Results indicate that the number of health care workers has a positive effect on net in-migration, and that this effect is large and statistically significant for the 70 + age group. Implications for rural development strategies are discussed. elder migration, health care, rural development, Community/Rural/Urban Development,...|$|R

50|$|First and foremost, Ergoldsbach is a <b>commuter</b> <b>community.</b> A large {{proportion}} of the population travel every day to Landshut, Munich, Dingolfing and Regensburg. In Ergoldsbach itself, is the Erlus corporation among other companies. There a variety of supermarkets, two bakeries with outlets in Neufahrn, Essenbach, Landshut, etc. and other small businesses.|$|E
50|$|The Black Diamond Bakery {{achieved}} regional fame in the 1970s for {{the quality}} of its breads and other baked goods, and continues to attract destination shoppers. The town's late 20th century population growth has been mostly as a <b>commuter</b> <b>community</b> for people with jobs in Seattle, Bellevue, and other suburban centers.|$|E
500|$|In the 1893 elections, Republicans recaptured {{control of}} the New Jersey Legislature. This was {{due in part to}} another {{economic}} depression, the Panic of 1893, which had occurred with Democrat Grover Cleveland in the White House, and in part because some Democrats, like Republicans before them, had proven corrupt. [...] The increasing commuter population also played a role; Bergen County contained (and still does) many <b>commuter</b> <b>communities</b> because of its proximity to New York City. These new residents were strongly Republican, as contrasted with the Democratic farmers. According to local historian Kevin Wright, [...] "Having gained sufficient numbers by 1893 to challenge Punkin Dusters at the polls, the Commuters of Bergen County led a political revolution in Home Rule that finally toppled the ancien régime." [...] Legal disputes about {{control of the}} New Jersey Senate and the Republican desire to undo many Democratic policies occupied the legislature {{in the early part of}} its 1894 session. Nevertheless, interest groups such as local landowners pushed the legislature for permissive policies on municipal incorporation, hoping to gain power in the new governments.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, Paris has {{experienced}} population growth, {{which may be}} in part attributed to the rising popularity of rural communities among GTA bound <b>commuters</b> (see bedroom <b>community)</b> and the completion of Highway 403 between Hamilton and Woodstock.|$|R
50|$|A {{building}} {{boom in the}} 1970s resulted in {{a significant increase in}} housing capacity replacing the large tracts of farmland, mainly in the form of large tract housing developments (e.g. Hillcrestshire, located off of Buck Road). Since then, the town has seen additional growth, becoming a prototypical <b>commuter</b> bedroom <b>community</b> for suburban families. The area's proximity to both Philadelphia and the Trenton/Princeton, New Jersey area make Holland a desirable location, despite its lack of public transit.|$|R
50|$|The {{neighbourhood}} {{is almost}} entirely a <b>commuter</b> <b>community,</b> {{and it was just}} in the Spring of 2007 that Seville's TUSSAM municipal bus routes incorporated stops in Bellavista into the city's bus routes. The N-IV road leads north from Bellavista into Seville as the Avenida de Jerez, and south to Dos Hermanas as the Avenida de Bellavista.|$|E
50|$|In 1956, {{the first}} {{span of the}} Lake Pontchartrain Causeway opened to {{automobile}} traffic. A second span was added in 1969. The new road spurred the growth of Mandeville {{and the surrounding area}} as a suburban <b>commuter</b> <b>community</b> for people working in New Orleans. This trend increased in the 1980s and 1990s, further integrating Mandeville into the Greater New Orleans metropolitan area.|$|E
5000|$|On May 28, 1653, Bennebroek {{split off}} from the Heemstede fiefdom and Adriaen Pauw (1622-1697), son of Adriaan Pauw, became its first feudal lord. Its {{population}} was dependent on animal husbandry and transportation. Later on bulb flower cultivation became an important business here. Yet since {{the second half of}} the 20th century, Bennebroek functions primarily as a <b>commuter</b> <b>community</b> for the surrounding cities.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, rural and {{southern}} {{portions of the}} Naugatuck Valley have evolved into sprawling <b>commuter</b> towns. <b>Communities</b> like Shelton and Oxford have become popular bedroom communities for residents working in New York City and lower Fairfield County. Vast sections of farmland {{up and down the}} Naugatuck Valley have also been developed for the building of luxury homes. Despite this suburbanization, however, the region is still tied to its core city centers like Derby and downtown areas of Ansonia and Naugatuck, thus retaining its working-class flavor.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the decline}} of the textile {{industry}} during the 20th century, the village has now become largely a <b>commuter</b> and retirement <b>community.</b> It is home to an award-winning Medical Centre, a public park, four public houses, several retirement homes and a solitary school, Addingham Primary School.|$|R
50|$|The longest {{standing}} {{forum on}} campus, the Student Government Association (SGA) {{consists of a}} 75-member legislature elected by the student body and an 8-member executive council, which represent each class and residence hall, <b>commuters,</b> WSU’s multicultural <b>community</b> and alumni {{and work in the}} interest of academic and social concerns.|$|R
