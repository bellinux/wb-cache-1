40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} among hospitalized patients from the General Hospital of Mingalardon in Myanmar. The aim {{of the study was}} to identify the malaria related perceptions, beliefs and health seeking behaviours among hospitalized patients so that necessary health education may be given effectively. A standardized questionnaire was administered to 300 hospitalized medical and surgical patients from the hospital. The respondents were all male, most of them were between 18 and 55 years of age. It was found that misconception on causes of malaria included: eating banana and fruit 39. 71 %; drinking swampy stream water 60. 3 %; tiredness 29. 7 %; sleeplessness 34. 3 %; changing weather 32. 3 %; and getting caught in the rain 34. 3 %. As for malaria preventive measures, the study found that 68 % of them do not want to use mosquito net owing to their habitual nature. In combating malaria, prevention is the most efficient method to be employed. Once it is contracted, effective cure of the disease can only be realized by employing correct use of the anti-malaria drugs with full confidence and reliance. The study explored and determined the experiences of hospitalized malaria patients and their beliefs and practices in combating the disease. The results of the study can be used to identify appropriate approaches and methods that will give patients broader knowledge of malaria and educate them on self-care health practices to prevent and combat malaria effectively. The findings suggest that strong measures should be taken to further improve the level of malaria knowledge of patients. Cho Cho Oo, <b>Htein</b> <b>Lin,</b> Pearson, A. [URL]...|$|R
