40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multi-objective model for scheduling of radiotherapy treatments for cancer patients based on genetic algorithms (GA). The model is developed and implemented considering real life radiotherapy treatment processes at Arden Cancer Centre, Coventry, UK. Two objectives are defined: minimisation of the Average patient waiting times and minimisation of Average tardiness of the patient first treatment fractions. Two scenarios are analysed considering {{the availability of the}} doctors to <b>approve</b> <b>treatment</b> plans. The schedules generated by the GA using real data collected from the collaborating Cancer Centre have good performance. It is demonstrated that enabling doctors to <b>approve</b> <b>treatment</b> plans instantly has a great impact on Average waiting time and Average tardiness for all patient categories...|$|R

50|$|Oxcarbazepine is an {{anticonvulsant}} drug primarily {{used in the}} treatment of epilepsy. There is some evidence for oxcarbazepine as a mood-stabilizing agent and thus, it can be used as add-on therapy for bipolar disorder in patients that have failed or are unable to tolerate <b>approved</b> <b>treatments.</b>|$|R

40|$|SummaryAimThe aim of {{this study}} was to provide a {{parameter}} for treatment plan comparisons in clinical practice. Materials and Methods 21 patients with brain tumours were selected for analysis. Two alternative treatment plans were calculated for each patient. One of the alternative plans was approved while the second one was rejected by the physician. Alternative plans were compared with the parameter RPI. The computer program RPIWin® was prepared to facilitate the calculation process. ResultsCalculations showed that 80 % of <b>approved</b> <b>treatment</b> plans had higher RPI than rejected ones. Only 4 cases of <b>approved</b> <b>treatment</b> plans were characterized by lower RPI values than rejected ones. ConclusionThe experiment demonstrated that the Radiation Planning Index formula takes into account the relation between dose distributions calculated for planning treatment volumes and organs at risk and is a convenient tool for treatment plan comparisons in routine clinical practice...|$|R

30|$|There is no officially <b>approved</b> <b>treatment</b> for {{patients}} with IJO. The effect {{of any kind of}} medical intervention is difficult to judge because the disease is rare, has a variable course, and is generally believed to resolve without treatment.

50|$|The Share Incentive Plan (the ‘SIP’) {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the UK in 2000. SIP's are an HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue & <b>Customs)</b> <b>approved,</b> tax efficient all employee plan, which provides companies with the flexibility to tailor the plan to meet their business needs. SIPs are becoming increasingly popular with companies that want to engage their workforce and recruit and retain key employees. From 6 April 2014, HMRC approval {{will no longer be}} required for a SIP to obtain tax benefits, instead an employer is required to self-certify that the SIP meets the requirements of the relevant legislation. Accordingly, from 6 April 2014, a SIP should no longer be referred to as an HMRC approved plan.|$|R

Recent advances in the use of lipids as novel therapeutics are discussed.|$|R
