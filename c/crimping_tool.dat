50|$|Solid rivets {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} and most {{reliable}} types of fasteners, having been found in archaeological findings dating back to the Bronze Age. Solid rivets consist simply of a shaft and head that are deformed with a hammer or rivet gun. A rivet compression or <b>crimping</b> <b>tool</b> can also deform this type of rivet. This tool is mainly used on rivets close to the edge of the fastened material, since the tool is limited by the depth of its frame. A rivet compression tool does not require two people, and is generally the most foolproof way to install solid rivets.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a new ultrasonic measurement technique to quantitatively assess wire crimp terminations is discussed. The {{development of}} a prototype instrument, based on a modified, commercially available, <b>crimp</b> <b>tool,</b> is demonstrated for applying this technique when wire crimps are installed. The <b>crimp</b> <b>tool</b> has three separate crimping locations that accommodate the three different ferrule diameters. The <b>crimp</b> <b>tool</b> in this study is capable of crimping wire diameters ranging from 12 to 26 American Wire Gauge (AWG). A transducer design is presented that allows for interrogation of each of the three crimp locations on the <b>crimp</b> <b>tool</b> without reconfiguring the device. An analysis methodology, based on transmitted ultrasonic energy and timing of the first received pulse is shown to correlate to both crimp location in the tool and the AWG of the crimp/ferrule combination. The detectability of a number of the crimp failure pathologies, such as missing strands, partially inserted wires and incomplete crimp compression, is discussed. A wave propagation model, solved by finite element analysis, describes the compressional ultrasonic wave propagation through the junction during the crimping process...|$|R

50|$|The {{rear part}} of a {{detonator}} is usually made of a rigid but malleable aluminium alloy, sometimes supported by a relatively soft brass or copper structure to aid in reliably giving a strong and watertight seal without damaging the initiation source. A pair of detonator crimping pliers mate the detonator with the initiation source by allowing the detonator's back end to be inserted into the large hole present when the pliers is in the non-compressed position. When force is applied, the jaws will move closer to each other crimping {{the neck of the}} detonator.

50|$|These metal drums {{have two}} {{openings}} with flanges (2 in NPS and ¾ in NPS). Once the drums are filled, the plugs (bungs) are screwed in the flanges using pneumatic or hand operated bung tightener (plug wrench). To secure {{the contents of}} the drums against theft and adulteration during shipment, cap-seals made of metal and other types like metal-plastic laminates are used. These cap-seals sit on top of the flanges and are crimped, using a drum cap-seal <b>crimping</b> <b>tool,</b> also called a drum cap sealer. Once cap-seals are crimped, the plugs can be unscrewed only by breaking these cap-seals. Pneumatic and hand-operated cap-seal crimping tools are available.

40|$|This {{project is}} geared towards the {{redesign}} {{and implementation of}} a <b>crimping</b> <b>tool</b> {{for use in the}} manufacturing of catheters produced by Medtronic Inc. Catheters require two steering cables to maneuver the end of the catheter through the body.

The current <b>crimping</b> <b>tool,</b> designed by Astro Tool Corp, has a few problems associated with its design. Additionally we are {{trying to get rid of}} a step in the manufacturing process that involves the adhesive, cyanoacrylate, being placed inside the sleeve to be crimped. The cyanoacrylate is added to increase the strength of the crimp from three to four pounds of force in shear to around eighteen pounds. However to simplify the manufacturing process we will need to come up with a crimp style for our device that will increase the allowable axial force to eighteen pounds with a metal to metal crimp alone and eliminate the need for an adhesive. The redesigned <b>crimping</b> <b>tool</b> will need high tolerance fit for each crimp as well as a repeatability of crimps for each cycle...|$|E

40|$|Goal of {{this work}} is the {{development}} of a new package to be integrated into large-area smart textiles. The benefits of the well-known crimp technology are transferred to a new field. The so-called Crimp Flat Pack (CFP) is a lead-frame based electronic package that features crimp terminals instead of standard leads. The module can be directly attached to different types of substrates, in particular to fabric circuits. Its size and complexity can reach from a simple two-terminal package to larger multi-terminal devices. The standard sized module has a circuit board area of 2 cm × 2 cm and 10 crimp terminals. Eight of them are used for the communication between other modules and for mechanical attachment. Two terminals are used to attach a sensor that collects data inside the fabric. Mainly two tools were developed for the process. At first, a forming tool that bends the contact pins upwards and brings the crimp barrels into shape as well as the actual <b>crimping</b> <b>tool</b> that allows parallel crimping. On the system's side of view the module carries a simple micro-controller and passives. Communication between neighboring modules is done via I 2;C-protocol. Measurement of sensor date inside the fabric can be realized. The new package opens opportunities to the manufacturing of smart textiles as it uses standard manufacturing technologies as well as a robust, low-cost, and low-temperature interconnection technology...|$|E

50|$|Termination of modular {{connector}} cables is very similar, {{regardless of}} the number of positions and contacts in the plug. To prevent damage to the plug (and the expensive crimp die-set), the <b>crimp</b> <b>tool</b> must be carefully matched to the plug being attached. For example, termination of a cable with an 8P8C plug involves using a hand crimper or crimp machine containing an 8P8C die-set or an A67T standard die-set. An 8P8C crimp die-set usually looks similar to an 8P8C jack, except for the eight teeth lining the top portion of the die. When the tool is operated, the die compresses around the 8P8C plug. As the die compresses, these teeth force the plug contacts down into the conductors of the cable being terminated, permanently attaching the plug to the cable.|$|R

This pulse is transmitted through the UECT into the crimp. A second transducer converts the second signal into a third signal, which may be further conditioned, and the ultrasonic signals are calibrated using the third signal or its conditioned variant. An apparatus for calibrating the ultrasonic signals includes a pulse module (PM) electrically connected to the first and second transducers, and an oscilloscope or display electrically connected to the PM for analyzing an electrical output signal therefrom...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a new ultrasonic measurement technique to assess quantitatively wire crimp terminations is discussed. The amplitude change of a compressional ultrasonic wave propagating at right angles to the wire axis and through the junction of a crimp termination is shown to correlate with the results of a destructive pull test, which is a standard for assessing crimp wire junction quality. To demonstrate the technique, the case of incomplete compression of crimped connections is ultrasonically tested, and the results are correlated with pull tests. Results show that the nondestructive ultrasonic measurement technique consistently predicts good crimps when the ultrasonic transmission is above a certain threshold amplitude level. A quantitative measure {{of the quality of the}} crimped connection based on the ultrasonic energy transmitted is shown to respond accurately to crimp quality. A wave propagation model, solved by finite element analysis, describes the compressional ultrasonic wave propagation through the junction during the crimping process. This model is in agreement within 6 % of the ultrasonic measurements. A prototype instrument for applying this technique while wire crimps are installed is also presented. The instrument is based on a two-jaw type <b>crimp</b> <b>tool</b> suitable for butt-splice type connections.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a novel technical solution that is aimed {{to improve the quality of}} cable crimp terminations in the electronics industry. The automotive, aero and military vehicle industries are of special interest due to their stringent requirements for guaranteed quality assurances in relation to their safety-critical products. The emphasis is on handheld <b>crimping</b> <b>tools,</b> where a new scheme for measuring the relevant crimp force is proposed using a small embedded computer to process information; so as to make an on-instrument statement regarding the crimp process quality. The thesis includes a detailed review of the current technical practices in the cable termination business, with a particular emphasis on the quality estimations for crimped connections using the crimp force monitoring (CFM) scheme. A comprehensive study of the state-of-the-art crimp force monitoring schemes and technologies is presented. A gap in the tool chain is identified whereby the industry has a preference for the use of hand tools in some selected processes; but the CFM scheme cannot be currently integrated directly with such hand tools. The bulk of the work in this thesis is thus focused on the development of a technical solution that will address this need for integration of hand tools with the CFM scheme. The concept is to develop a fully embedded subsystem that can be attached directly to a hand tool and this system will perform all of the signal processing and the statistical analysis so that each crimped joint can be trusted to meet the relevant stated quality parameters. In the course of development work a fully functional prototype subsystem is developed for the CFM solution, for application to hand tools. Analytical and statistical measurement and assessment algorithms were developed to a standard, which allows a final quality rating to be applied to crimped joint connections. Such algorithms are designed to be embedded directly onto the instrument’s microcomputer. The new system has been evaluated and tested in the course of this research project and it has currently been accepted by a number of industries for a planned volume qualification assessment...|$|R
