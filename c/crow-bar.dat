6000|$|For {{a purpose}} {{such as this}} the cellar was well adapted. Its walls were loosely constructed, and had lately been {{plastered}} throughout with a rough plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from hardening.

They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold there a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide.

60|$|Now a {{piece of}} good fortune {{happened}} to him, although to an ordinary traveller {{it might have been}} considered a matter of no importance whatever. On the edge of the shore, where it had floated down from some region higher up the river, Bartholemy perceived an old board, in which there were some long and heavy rusty nails. Greatly encouraged by this discovery the indefatigable traveller set about a work which resembled that of the old woman who wanted a needle, and who began to rub a <b>crow-bar</b> on a stone in order to reduce it to the proper size. Bartholemy carefully knocked all the nails out of the board, and then finding a large flat stone, he rubbed down one of them until he had formed it into the shape of a rude knife blade, which he made as sharp as he could. Then with these tools he undertook the construction of a raft, working away like a beaver, and using the sharpened nails instead of his teeth. He cut down a number of small trees, and when he had enough of these slender trunks he bound them together with reeds and osiers, which he found on the river bank. So, after infinite labor and trial he constructed a raft which would bear him {{on the surface of the}} water. When he had launched this he got upon it, gathering up his legs so as to keep out of reach of the alligators, and with a long pole pushed himself off from shore. Sometimes paddling and sometimes pushing his pole against the bottom, he at last got across the river and took up his journey upon dry land.|$|E

It was necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow, and to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin; and when he did begin he made every down-stroke so slowly that it might have been six feet long, while at every up-stroke I could hear his pen spluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on the side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into space, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was tripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole he got on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and had removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with his two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the effect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there, with unbounded satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|According to a tradition, a bell {{had been}} once hung upon this rock by an abbot of Arbroath,[11] [...] "and being taken {{down by a}} sea-pirate, a year {{thereafter}} he perished upon the same rock, with ship and goods, in the righteous judgment of God."

The fishers approached the rock with an extreme timidity; but their harvest appears to have been great, and the adventure no more perilous than lucrative. In 1800, on the occasion of my grandfather's first landing, and during the two or three hours which the ebb-tide and the smooth water allowed them to pass upon its shelves, his crew collected upwards of two hundredweight of old metal: pieces of a kedge anchor and a cabin stove, <b>crow-bars,</b> a hinge and lock of a door, a ship's marking-iron, a piece of a ship's caboose, a soldier's bayonet, a cannon ball, several pieces of money, a shoe-buckle, and the like. Such were the spoils of the Bell Rock. But the number of vessels actually lost upon the reef was as nothing to those that were cast away in fruitless efforts to avoid it. Placed right in the fairway of two navigations, and one of these the entrance to the only harbour of refuge between the Downs and the Moray Firth, it breathed abroad along the whole coast an atmosphere of terror and perplexity; and no ship sailed that part of the North Sea at night, but what the ears of those on board would be strained to catch the roaring of the seas on the Bell Rock.|$|R
40|$|Laser-induced {{magnetic}} fields in ICF capsules Final Report, DE-FG 02 - 08 ER 85128, Phase 1 E. L. LINDMAN, Otowi Technical Services, Los Alamos, NM. The performance of an inertial-confinement-fusion (ICF) capsule {{can be improved}} by inserting a magnetic field into it before compressing it [Kirkpatrick, et al., Fusion Technol. 27, 205 (1995) ]. To obtain standoff in an ICF power generator, a method of inserting the field {{without the use of}} low-inductance leads attached to the capsule is desired. A mechanism for generating such a field using a laser was discovered in Japan [Sakagami, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 42, 839 (1979), Kolodner and Yablonovitch, Phys. Rev. Lett. 43, 1402 (1979) ] and studied at Los Alamos in the 1980 s [M. A. Yates, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 49, 1702 (1982); Forslund and Brackbill, Phys. Rev. Lett. 48, 1614 (1982) ]. In this mechanism, a p-polarized laser beam strikes a solid target producing hot electrons that are accelerated away from the target surface by resonant absorption. An electric field is created that returns the hot electrons to the target. But, they do not return to the target along the same trajectory on which they left. The resulting current produces a toroidal magnetic field that was observed to spread over a region outside the hot spot with a radius of a millimeter. No experimental measurements of the magnetic field strength were performed. Estimates from computer simulation suggest that field strengths in the range of 1 to 10 Mega gauss (100 to 1000 Tesla) were obtained outside of the laser spot. To use this mechanism to insert a magnetic field into an ICF capsule, the capsule must be redesigned. In one approach, a central conductor is added, a toroidal gap is cut in the outer wall and the DT fuel is frozen on the inner surface of the capsule. The capsule is dropped into the reaction chamber and struck first with the laser that generates the magnetic field. The laser hot spot is positioned {{at the center of the}} toroidal gap. As the magnetic field spreads from the hot spot over the surface that contains the toroidal gap, it will propagate through the gap and set up a steady state in the capsule. The main compression is then initiated. First, it closes the gap and <b>crow-bars</b> the field, then it compresses the fuel to ignition. In addition to this application, we discuss the use of this mechanism to induce Mega-gauss fields in laboratory apparatus for measurements of the effects of large {{magnetic fields}} on material samples. A preliminary target design for this purpose is presented. It is made of high-density material with no hydrogen surface contamination to minimize fast ion losses and to minimize x-ray preheat of the sample (the material, whose magnetic properties are to be measured). In it, the gap is designed to allow the magnetic field to move into the interior of the target while minimizing the flow of hot electrons into the interior. By adjusting the size of the gap as well as its configuration, the hot electron effects can be minimized. Since the strength of the magnetic field depends on the radial distance to the sample from the center of the conductor carrying the return current, the sample is located at a point of minimum conductor radius. This location also minimizes the effects on the measurement of any hot electrons that flow into the interior. Useful experiments can be accomplished with the “seed” field alone in this geometry. Compressing the capsule after the insertion of the seed field may allow experiments with even larger magnetic fields. We have used computer-simulation techniques to address a number of issues. Our conclusions include: • This magnetic-field generating mechanism is a viable method for generating magnetic fields in ICF targets and for laboratory experiments. • Useful experiments on material samples can be done with the seed field of 1 to 10 Mega gauss (100 to 1000 Tesla) and higher magnetic fields can be obtained by subsequently compressing the capsule. • The results reported here can be studied experimentally with a modest CO 2 laser that emits 4. 5 J of energy in a 1 -ns pulse focused into a 60 -μm-diameter spot. • We have reproduced the published calculation of Forslund and Brackbill and extended the results to relativistic hot electrons. The difference in our peak magnetic field (1. 25 Mg) versus that in the published calculation (1. 3 Mg) is negligible. • We have shown that hot electrons can jump a gap while the magnetic field penetrates through the gap into an internal region. • We find that background plasma or a plasma gradient near the accelerating region is essential to the formation of the magnetic-field structures. • And, we have identified resistive losses in the surface return current as a serious issue that must be addressed in future work...|$|R

40|$|For the {{accreditation}} of standards in all vocational higher education learning contexts, {{the question of}} how to develop and assess competence is central. There are certain situations where relevant skills can be assessed in the workplace, but for most the only viable option is to simulate a practice setting in something like a workshop/studio, by modelling or through role-play. The possibility of replicating a dynamic workplace situation and the competences that go with it in an immersive virtual reality offers perhaps the first practical opportunity for large student cohorts to practice and assess technical competence in a robust and secure setting. This paper outlines a pilot project currently under development that seeks to develop a serious video game built in CryENGINE 2 to enable first-year construction management students to learn and demonstrate their technical competence in domestic construction. A theoretical framework for the design, development and evaluation of serious video game technology is detailed, based on the various work of de Freitas and of Luckin. The project development to this point is described and illustrated. Learners playing the game are required to source a variety of tools which they use to deconstruct (demolish) a selected building model. For example, at the simplest level, they might use tools such as a virtual <b>crow-bar</b> or an excavator to dismantle a domestic house model piece by piece. Alternatively, using a form of forensic analysis, the learner is required to determine how particular domestic house models (constructed with deliberate design faults) may or may not fail to satisfy statutory and other building regulations...|$|E
40|$|The Thesis {{presents}} an in-depth study of arcing behaviour of H. B. C. Fuses {{for a range}} of fuse elements and fillers, under critical current conditions. The methodologies used were the standard breaking capacity short-circuit test plus the application of <b>crow-bar,</b> Xray studies, metallographic microscopic and optical fiber arc detection techniques. Due to the observation of some unknown and puzzling arc phenomena it was decided to pursue the arc investigation by an extensive test programme of single uniform wire fuse elements. From the investigation a basic arc mechanism for the pre-peak and post-peak arcs period was discovered. The new mechanism was applied to single wire, strip, long notched, medium notched and short notched fuse elements and to paralleled wires and strips immersed in three quartz filler types: standard sand, high quality granular quartz and bound quartz in two different sizes. The proposed arc mechanism was modelled by a computer program which was used to simulate the described fuse constructions. The results of over 800 tests and subsequent simulation undoubtedly confirm that the proposed arc mechanism is applicable for the described fuse types. The experimental and analytical results are close enough to justify the model application for fuse designers and fuse users. A critical comparison of the experimental and analytical results with previous findings published by other researchers is presented. A detailed arc mechanism and the key behaviour rules are proposed, they are: " Maximum column voltage can not exceed the arc-root voltage. " The arc-root voltage and the initial dv/dt values are influenced by filler characteristics and are able to precisely characterize the filler behaviour. " The dv/dt, and consequently the burn-back are instantaneous current density functions. The application of the above rules allows the fuse designer to tailor the fuse element in order to obtain specific current and arc voltage waveforms. It is believed that the proposed arc mechanism and computer model is able to explain some puzzling are phenomena and eventually could be applied to predicting other low overload H. B.
