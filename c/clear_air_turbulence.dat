In order to utilize measurement data of Doppler LIDAR, we design the model predictive flight controller to avoid accidents caused by microburst wind shear in the landing configuration assuming the prior information would be obtained by Doppler LIDAR.

Horza has kept Balveda alive, and she is taken into the complex. The CATs crew encounter the Idirans in one of the Command System stations, and after a firefight apparently kill one and capture the other. After tracking the Mind to another station, the drone Unaha-Closp discovers it hiding in the reactor car of a Command System train. The second Idiran, who had been mortally wounded but not killed, sets one of the trains for a collision course to the station. The captured Idiran, Xoxarle, frees himself and in the ensuing impact and firefight the remaining members of the <b>Clear</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Turbulence</b> are killed.

40|$|During {{the grant}} period, several tasks were {{performed}} {{in support of}} the NASA Turbulence Prediction and Warning Systems (TPAWS) program. The primary focus of the research was on characterizing the preturbulence environment by developing predictive tools and simulating atmospheric conditions that preceded severe turbulence. The goal of the research being to provide both dynamical understanding of conditions that preceded turbulence as well as providing predictive tools in support of operational NASA B- 757 turbulence research flights. The advancements in characterizing the preturbulence environment will be applied by NASA to sensor development for predicting turbulence onboard commercial aircraft. Numerical simulations with atmospheric models as well as multi-scale observational analyses provided insights into the environment organizing turbulence in a total of forty-eight specific case studies of severe accident producing turbulence on commercial aircraft. These accidents exclusively affected commercial aircraft. A paradigm was developed which diagnosed specific atmospheric circulation systems from the synoptic scale down to the meso-y scale that preceded <b>turbulence</b> in both <b>clear</b> <b>air</b> and in proximity to convection. The emphasis was primarily on convective turbulence as that is what the TPAWS program is most focused on in terms of developing improved sensors for turbulence warning and avoidance. However, the dynamical paradigm also has applicability to <b>clear</b> <b>air</b> and mountain <b>turbulence.</b> This dynamical sequence of events was then employed to formulate and test new hazard prediction indices that were first tested in research simulation studies and then ultimately were further tested {{in support of the}} NASA B- 757 turbulence research flights. The new hazard characterization algorithms were utilized in a Real Time Turbulence Model (RTTM) that was operationally employed to support the NASA B- 757 turbulence research flights. Improvements in the RTTM were implemented in an effort to increase the accuracy of the operational characterization of the preturbulence environment. Additionally, the initial research necessary to create a statistical evaluation scheme for the characterization indices utilized in the RTTM was undertaken. Results of all components of this research were then published in NASA contractor reports and scientific journal papers...|$|R

40|$|Prediction of {{the effect}} of <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> on {{statistics}} relevant to a collision–coalescence process repre-sents a key challenge in the modeling of cloud microphysics. In this paper, collision-related statistics for gravity-driven motion of droplets are considered and various probability distributions associated with geometric configuration and relative motion of colliding droplets are theoretically derived. The theoretical results agree well with numerical results obtained from direct numerical simulations (DNSs). In the absence of <b>air</b> <b>turbulence,</b> the probability distributions, calculated {{at the beginning of the}} time steps used for collision detection, nontrivially depend on the time step size.

To address the effect of stochastic correlations, we derive and validate a true stochastic coalescence equation.
