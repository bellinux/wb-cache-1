The ready-mixed concrete franchise business in Thailand is business format franchise which Hoffman and Prebles (1993) explained the business format franchise that franchisees replicate in their local community an entire business concept, including product or service, trade name and methods of operation and Rubin (1978) stated that business format franchise controls by the franchisor may extend over products sold, price, hours of operation, condition of the plant, inventory, insurance, personnel and accounting and auditing. In driving franchise network competitiveness, there are two keys factors namely Franchisee Perceived Benefits and Franchisor Assistances were identified. The Franchisee Perceived Benefits consist of sales force enhancement, sales referral and tolling, asset networking, access to government projects, access to national and international contractors while Franchisor <b>Assistances</b> consist of <b>commercial</b> <b>assistances,</b> technical assistances, supplier relations and consultation assistances.

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the German {{criminal}} law in regard to euthanasia. Referring to the traditional classification, active indirect euthanasia, passive euthanasia, and assistance in suicide are legal in Germany, whereas active direct euthanasia is a crime. As criminal law is to be interpreted {{in the light of}} the Constitution, the most relevant Constitutional principles such as human dignity, the right to life and physical integrity, and the right to self-determination are presented. This legal overview is complemented by some of the currently most controversial issues within the topic. These include the impact of the new German law on living wills on the criminal law on euthanasia. Among other relevant debates, the issue of the criminalization of <b>commercial</b> <b>assistance</b> in suicide is discussed. The chapter concludes that despite the difficulties in the practical differentiation, the law on euthanasia is rather clear in Germany. The problem that remains, however, is the legal insecurity still largely found among the population and also among physicians and even lawyers. This insecurity leads to a frequent circulation of unqualified warnings, for one of a discussion concerning the legalization of active direct euthanasia, which currently is not at all being considered. ...|$|E

This dissertation examines US efforts to promote social and economic reconstruction in Siberia between 1917 and 1922. After the collapse of the Provisional Government, Siberia became a focal point in the Great Powers' struggle to redivide the existing spheres of influence. This study views the American assistance policy as part of this broader imperial rivalry and necessarily implies a wider perspective on the debate over the American involvement in revolutionary Russia. It demonstrates that this policy simultaneously represented the primary response of American statesmen to events in revolutionary Russia and an important new dimension in their efforts to promote an Open Door political economy. Since American policy-makers considered Bolshevism to be epiphenomenal, the byproduct of widespread instability, the counter-revolutionary tendencies inherent in Wilson's policy toward Siberia were subordinate to the progressive role American Open Door diplomacy played in its struggle against the efforts of the European Powers and Japan to establish spheres of influence in the Russian Empire. Therefore, the American plan for Siberia should be viewed as a distinctly Wilsonian experiment in foreign assistance policy. The Wilson Administration's assistance policy focused on two complementary initiatives: the restoration of operations on the Trans-Siberian Railway and the provision of <b>commercial</b> <b>assistance</b> to the Siberian population via the region's prominent peasant cooperatives. These forms of assistance were aimed at promoting the recovery of Russian civil society in order to help Russia develop its own form of "self-government. " American statesmen believed Siberia would rapidly develop a post-Tsarist civil society because of its rich natural resources and its relatively egalitarian social structure. As this social and economic transformation proceeded, Siberia would provide an unparalleled outlet for American investment and thereby help to solidify an Open Door system. Between 1919 and 1922, the US sponsored the establishment of the inter-Allied Railway Committee for supervision of the Trans-Siberian Railway, an institutional innovation which foreshadowed post-WW II developmental agencies. Finally, this study draws important parallels between the reconstruction efforts in Siberia and the developmental policy the US had been promoting in China since 1900...|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : Assisting UsersInternational audienceIn this paper, we {{describe}} the software architecture of a commercially run home assistance system that allows patients or elderly people to stay longer at home. Since such systems often have to handle sensitive medical information, {{the protection of the}} privacy is a major concern. Also, legislation often restricts access to health information to qualified persons (i. e. medical personnel), who are not always available in a commercial company. The home assistance system can offer several services, going from scheduling necessary tasks and following up their execution, to monitoring the patient’s health status and responding promptly to requests for help or to emergency situations, and all this without the need to maintain personal medical data or identifying information in the home assistance center. This paper focusses on how the <b>commercial</b> home <b>assistance</b> center will keep track of the anonymized patients’ networks.

30|$|Aid {{under this}} {{category}} {{is the sort}} of foreign assistance that donors extend with the objective of obtaining economic benefits. Schraeder et al. (1998 : 9), Woods (2005 : 401), Lancaster (2007 : 14 - 15) and Van der Veen (2011 : 10) note that <b>commercial</b> foreign <b>assistance</b> directly contributes to the economy of the donor by expanding export markets, providing access to raw materials, offering energy supplies or promoting foreign investment. Due to its nature and the related procurement conditions this form of ODA is often referred as ‘tied aid’. The most relevant example in this category is Japan, whose economic interests are the core drivers of its aid. Economic prosperity of neighbours is critical to Japanese economic growth and therefore its aid concentrates in the Asia-Pacific Rim. The business community and the Ministry of Trade and Industry have great influence on ODA policy-making and so Japanese aid allocations tend to be heavily tied compared to other DAC-donors (Mason 1964; Huntington 1970 : 169; Schraeder et al. 1998 : 9 - 10; Lancaster 2007 : 14). This reflects the importance of aid allocations bringing economic benefits to donor countries.|$|R

Most of these were intercontinental, long-haul routes connecting France with West and Southern Africa. On 1 November 1963 UTA introduced DC-8 jets on its flights from Paris to Lagos, Accra, Monrovia and Freetown. UTA's creation coincided with a new French aviation policy that established exclusive spheres of influence for UTA and Air France.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{research}} study discussed and amplified {{in this paper}} consisted of the development and evaluation of two instructional concepts illustrating the procedures for 1) typing an offset master, and 2) duplicating offset copies.

40|$|The {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union created a new region of instability. The former republics of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are situated in a strategic region that has garnered the attention of numerous actors in a competition for influence in Central Asia. It also saw the entrance of a most unlikely player: Israel. Since 1948, Israeli foreign policy has been directed at guaranteeing {{the security of the}} nation. Israel responded to the emergence of an independent Central Asia by evaluating the region's potential to impact its security and engaging the region to prevent the emergence of hostile regimes. Israel's strategic objectives in the region were to block Iranian inroads and to expand Tel Aviv's sphere of influence in order to secure the survival of the Israeli state. By constructively engaging Central Asia in diplomatic, economic, and security relations, Israel exerted its influence over the region. In the first ten years of independence, Israel achieved all its objectives. This thesis examines the reasons behind Israel's interests and evaluates its successes. It will explain what threat perceptions drove Israel's relationship with these states and evaluate these possible threats. This will be accomplished through an examination of the relationship and an evaluation of its successes in the advancement of Israeli national security interests. The focus of this study will be on the complex and multifaceted relations between Israel and the republics of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. This study will examine Israel's multifaceted relationship with these two republics within the framework of Israel's overall nation security policy and foreign policy objectives. This thesis will explore and evaluate Israel's principal relations with these states, including diplomatic relations, development <b>assistance,</b> <b>commercial</b> relations, and security cooperation. These aspects of the relationship will be explored in order to trace Tel Aviv's interest and exposure. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
