2500|$|Harrison's {{handwritten}} lyrics for [...] "Here <b>Comes</b> <b>the</b> Moon" [...] are dated 25 February, the {{day after}} his 35th birthday. The song's nature-related theme matches that of much of his previous work, including [...] "All Things Must Pass", [...] "Here <b>Comes</b> <b>the</b> Sun" [...] and [...] "Blow Away". Due to the similarity of its title with [...] "Here <b>Comes</b> <b>the</b> Sun", the song has invited interpretation as a sequel to that 1969 Harrison composition. Author Ian Inglis writes that the two songs differ significantly, however, in that while [...] "Here <b>Comes</b> <b>the</b> Sun" [...] adopts the arrival of sunshine as a metaphor for hope and an end to a dark emotional mood, [...] "Here <b>Comes</b> <b>the</b> Moon" [...] focuses purely on the moment itself, rather than what the moon's appearance might suggest. While also viewing the songs as having little in common aside from their titles, Harrison biographer Simon Leng considers that [...] "Here <b>Comes</b> <b>the</b> Moon" [...] shares the earlier composition's theme of escape.|$|R

5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} <b>came</b> <b>the</b> augers and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the gravel and dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E
