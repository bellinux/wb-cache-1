25|$|Only one new unit, the Neotank, {{was added}} to the {{original}} set in Advance Wars. Two new terrain features were introduced: the Missile Silo and the Pipeline (along with its breakable Pipe Seams). The Missile Silo can be fired by foot troops to deal area of effect damage, and pipelines act as impassable walls. Because of its function as a wall, players can use it to <b>create</b> <b>maps</b> smaller than the default dimension the map editor provides, something that was not possible in the game's predecessor.|$|E

25|$|Lunar transits {{have been}} used to map X-ray {{emissions}} from the nebula. Before the launch of X-ray-observing satellites, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, X-ray observations generally had quite low angular resolution, but when the Moon passes in front of the nebula, its position is very accurately known, and so the variations in the nebula's brightness can be used to <b>create</b> <b>maps</b> of X-ray emission. When X-rays were first observed from the Crab Nebula, a lunar occultation was used to determine the exact location of their source.|$|E
25|$|Ptolemy also devised and {{provided}} {{instructions on how}} to <b>create</b> <b>maps</b> both of the whole inhabited world (oikoumenè) and of the Roman provinces. In {{the second part of the}} Geographia, he provided the necessary topographic lists, and captions for the maps. His oikoumenè spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean to China, and about 81 degrees of latitude from the Arctic to the East Indies and deep into Africa. Ptolemy was well aware that he knew about only a quarter of the globe.|$|E
25|$|The {{project has}} used crowd-sourcing to <b>create</b> <b>maps</b> which show where sexual assault has taken place. In 2012, Women Under Siege {{put out a}} call to people from Syria and those working with Syrian {{refugees}} {{to provide information about}} rape and sexual assault. The entries were created by collecting information from journalists, human rights activists and individual citizens. Some the reports came via email or by Twitter with the hashtag #RapeinSyria. Women Under Siege mapped these incidents, providing over 117 pieces of data for each entry. The data was documented in real time, using a software developed by Ushahidi. The data was analyzed and put together in a comprehensive report that details a huge amount of human suffering. Not only did the information shine a light on the problem, it also uncovered unexpected findings. For example, the data revealed that Syrian government forces were also largely responsible for much of the sexual violence.|$|E

40|$|A Web based {{application}} {{was designed and}} developed to <b>create</b> a <b>map</b> layer from a centralized tabular database query with the option of invoking an ArcIMS ® session in a separate browser window. Query requests were developed through an easy to use browser container and converted to a data object. The data object was converted to a map layer, an ArcIMS ® container was invoked, and the newly <b>created</b> <b>map</b> layer was then passed to the ArcIMS ® container. The application design was particularly useful for easily querying information from a complex tabular relational database and <b>creating</b> <b>map</b> layers for manipulation with ArcView. Report, chart, and contour map generation were also included as application options...|$|R

500|$|In {{all of its}} {{platforms}} {{except the}} Nintendo Switch, Doom includes a built-in level creation tool called [...] "SnapMap" [...] which allows players to create and edit maps with their own structure and game logic. With SnapMap, players can <b>create</b> <b>maps</b> for different modes, ranging from single-player levels to co-operative or competitive multiplayer maps. When players are building a level, the game will shift to a top-down view. Players can place rooms and hallways to form a level and connect them together. If they are not connected together, {{the color of the}} construction pieces changes to notify the player. Players can also use the X-ray camera which temporarily removes all the walls to allow players to view the objects inside. Players can also place enemies into their maps, {{with the exception of the}} campaign's bosses. Their artificial intelligence and stats, and the player's own movement speed can also be modified. Players can also add additional particle effects, lighting effects, and other gameplay items, such as health packs and ammo pick-ups. Only in-game assets can be used, and players cannot create or import their own models into the game. Levels can be tested before they are published online.|$|E
2500|$|Previous {{versions}} of Google Maps (now called [...] "classic maps") had a feature called 'My Places', allowing users to <b>create</b> <b>maps</b> with many locations saved as markers or 'pins'. These maps {{were used to}} reference places frequently visited or planned to be visited, planning or recording trip itineraries, etc. For example, a person could create a map of their favorite restaurants and share it with friends. Users could customize the look of markers, add comments to each marker, create routes, etc. These maps could easily be shared and were accessible from any browser when signed in, and from the mobile app for android. Multiple users could also collaborate on editing maps, and formerly maps could be made public to search by other users.|$|E
2500|$|Bradley {{continued}} to <b>create</b> <b>maps</b> during Postmaster General Granger's tenure, publishing a significant revision in 1810, but the War of 1812 made reliable mail delivery {{a much more}} hazardous enterprise. Return J. Meigs Jr., former governor of Ohio, was appointed to replace the retiring Granger in March 1814; again the incoming postmaster general kept the first assistant. As the wartime threat to Washington, D.C., grew, Bradley began looking for a farm {{away from the city}} where he and his wife could raise their children; in 1814 Bradley acquired a [...] farm in Montgomery County, Maryland near the tiny community of Chevy Chase. During the burning of Washington in 1814, many of the postal records and a few public officials were transferred for safety to the Bradley farmhouse, [...] north of the White House.|$|E

2500|$|Such as SmartLoader, SpeciMinder, ADAM, Tug Eskorta, and MT 400 with Motivity are {{designed}} for people-friendly workspaces. They navigate by recognizing natural features. 3D scanners or other means of sensing the environment {{in two or three}} dimensions help to eliminate cumulative errors in dead-reckoning calculations of the AGV's current position. [...] Some AGVs can <b>create</b> <b>maps</b> of their environment using scanning lasers with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and use those maps to navigate in real time with other path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms. They are able to operate in complex environments and perform non-repetitive and non-sequential tasks such as transporting photomasks in a semiconductor lab, specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses. For dynamic areas, such as warehouses full of pallets, AGVs require additional strategies using three-dimensional sensors such as time-of-flight or stereovision cameras.|$|E
2500|$|ArcGIS for Desktop {{consists}} of several integrated applications, including ArcMap, ArcCatalog, ArcToolbox, ArcScene, ArcGlobe, and ArcGIS Pro. [...] ArcCatalog is the data management application, used to browse datasets and files on one's computer, database, or other sources. [...] In addition to showing what data is available, ArcCatalog also {{allows users to}} preview the data on a map. [...] ArcCatalog also provides the ability to view and manage metadata for spatial datasets. [...] ArcMap is the application used to view, edit and query geospatial data, and <b>create</b> <b>maps.</b> [...] The ArcMap interface has two main sections, including a table of contents {{on the left and}} the data frame(s) which display the map. [...] Items in the table of contents correspond with layers on the map. [...] ArcToolbox contains geoprocessing, data conversion, and analysis tools, along with much of the functionality in ArcInfo. [...] It is also possible to use batch processing with ArcToolbox, for frequently repeated tasks. ArcScene is an application which allows the user to view their GIS data in 3-D and is available with the 3D Analyst License. [...] In the layer properties of ArcScene there is an Extrusion function which allows the user to exaggerate features three dimension-ally. ArcGlobe is another one of ArcGIS's 3D visualization applications available with the 3D Analyst License. ArcGlobe is a 3D visualization application that allows you to view large amounts of GIS data on a globe surface. [...] The ArcGIS Pro application was added to ArcGIS for Desktop in 2015. It had the combined capabilities of the other integrated applications and was built as a fully 64-bit software application.|$|E
