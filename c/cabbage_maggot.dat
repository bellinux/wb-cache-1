Valued at over $ 62 million per year, cabbage and other crucifers (broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, radishes, kale, collards, turnips, rutabagas, turnip and mustard greens, Chinese cabbage, and several other specialty vegetables) rank second in economic importance among New York vegetables, just after potatoes. Because cabbage represents the great majority (84 %) of acres of crucifers in NY, the information in this Crop Profile pertains to this crop, except where explicitly noted. Crucifers are attacked by a wide variety of pests, and pest management is complex and costly for these extremely important vegetable crops. While producers use a variety of insecticides of varying classes, organophosphates, including chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, endosulfan, and oxydemeton-methyl, play a very important role in cabbage insect management.

40|$|Advances in {{mass-production}} and formulation {{technology of}} entomopathogenic nematodes, {{the discovery of}} numerous isolates/strains and the desirability of reducing pesticide usage {{have resulted in a}} surge of scientific and commercial interest in these nematodes. The lessons learned from earlier problems have encouraged scientists and leading commercial companies to increase their efforts toward improving cost efficiency and better product positioning in the market within the confines of product capabilities. The successes or failures of the nematodes against 24 arthropod pest species of agriculture and animals and against a major slug pest in agriculture are discussed in this review. Commercial successes are documented in markets such as citrus (Diaprepes root weevil), greenhouses and glasshouses (black vine weevil, fungus gnats, thrips, and certain borers), turf (white grubs, billbugs, and mole crickets), and mushrooms (sciarid flies). In addition, the successful commercialization of a nematode (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) against slugs in agricultural systems is presented. Despite this progress, the reality is that nematode-based products have limited market share. Limited share is attributed to higher product cost compared to standard insecticides, low efficacy under unfavorable conditions, application timing and conditions, limited data and cost benefit in IPM programs, refrigeration requirements and limited room temperature shelf life (product quality), use of suboptimum nematode species, and lack of detail application directions. One or more of these factors affected the market introduction of the nematodes despite promising field efficacy against insects such as black cutworm in turf, sugar beet weevil in sugar beet, sweet potato weevil in sweet potato, and house fly adult in animal-rearing farms. Insects such as <b>cabbage</b> root <b>maggots,</b> carrot root weevil, and Colorado potato beetle are listed on the label of certain commercial products despite low efficacy data, due to insect susceptibility, biology, and/or behavior.

40|$|Due to the {{potential}} impact of conventional chemical pesticides on human health and on the environment, governments worldwide are developing policies to reduce the use of these pesticides. Instruments like the EU directive 91 / 414 /EEC, have resulted in the withdrawal of many active ingredients from the market. Furthermore, the new EU directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the sustainable use of pesticides states that non-chemical methods should be given priority wherever possible. To improve the sustainability of agriculture and to avoid resistance development against the receding number of active ingredients remaining on the market, biological alternatives for conventional chemical pesticides are much sought after and even urgently needed. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) are one of those alternatives. They are used for the biological control of an increasing number of insect pests. These bio-insecticides are exceptionally safe for farmers, farm workers, for consumers and for the environment. However, they may have lower efficacy than conventional chemical pesticides. Nonetheless, EPN are equivalent to or even better than conventional chemical insecticides in controlling a number of commercially important pests (e. g., against black vine weevil, citrus root weevil, cranberry girdler, hunting billbug and western corn rootworm). Poor efficacy against other pests can be the result of inappropriate application methods, the use of poor quality products or suboptimal application conditions. This work focused on optimizing the application of EPN in field vegetables. The general aim of this work was to test and, where possible, to improve the control potential of EPN against three difficult to reach pests, described in detail in chapter 1, viz. : the leaf-bound cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) in cauliflower, the soil-bound cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) in cauliflower and the cryptic onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) in leek. Depending on the target pest, the experiments described in chapters 2 to 5 examined the effect of (1) adding adjuvants to the spray suspension, (2) altering the application rate of the EPN and (3) adapting the application technique and/or (4) the timing of the application(s). Chapter 2 focused on improving the formulation and application of EPN on leaves using laboratory tests with special attention to one specific pest: the cabbage moth. Suitable adjuvants for EPN spray applications were selected based on the absence of toxic or immobilizing effects on two EPN species: Steinernema feltiae and S. carpocapsae. The selected humectants and dispersants were further screened for their effects on the sedimentation of these EPN species in a tank suspension. Next, the effect of three suitable surfactants and a humectant and the effect of nozzle size on the deposition of S. carpocapsae on hydrophobic cauliflower leaves was investigated. Subsequently, a laboratory experiment verified whether brewer’s yeast extract can be used as an attractant for the cabbage moth larvae, and whether it improves the mortality caused by EPN to cabbage moth larvae. Finally, the effect of the most suitable surfactant and humectant, selected from the deposition test, on the longevity and on the infectivity of S. carpocapsae, is presented. These experiments have shown that all selected alcohol ethoxylates (Synperonic 91 / 5, Synperonic 91 / 6, Synperonic 10 / 6 and Atplus 245) and the selected alkylpolysaccharide (AL- 2575) immobilized both S. carpocapsae and S. feltiae when mixed in the spray suspension. Xanthan gum remains the best sedimentation-retarding agent. An ISO 02 standard flat fan nozzle can clog when spraying S. carpocapsae. An ISO 04 standard flat fan nozzle provides a higher relative deposition of different S. carpocapsae-adjuvant suspensions on cauliflower leaves than the bigger ISO 08 standard flat fan nozzle. Three spreading agents (Silwet L- 77, SB Plant Invigorator and Addit) roughly doubled the relative EPN deposition with both the ISO 04 and the ISO 08 nozzle when added to the EPN suspension. Addition of xanthan gum did not significantly increase deposition any further. Addition of yeast extract to a foliar spray containing S. carpocapsae significantly increased mortality of the cabbage moth and decreased the amount of leaf damage caused by these caterpillars. And finally, it was shown that adding Addit and xanthan gum to a spray suspension containing S. carpocapsae prolongs the survival of EPN on leaves, and that these adjuvants can cause mortality in larvae of Galleria mellonella. It was however deemed unlikely, and proven in a field test (chapter 3), that Addit and xanthan gum at the used concentrations, would {{have a significant effect on}} insect plagues in field conditions. The field experiments described in chapter 3 implemented the results of chapter 2 and aimed to optimize the control of cabbage moth with S. carpocapsae. A spray application tools test, was performed to select a spray application technique that leads to a maximum of spray coverage on specific parts of the cauliflower plant. The targeted spraying areas were: (1) the central part of the plant, where the cabbage moth larvae can cause direct economic damage to the cauliflower head, and (2) the underside of the leaves, where the young larvae hide during the day and feed during the night. The test showed that two spray boom configurations with vertical extensions in the crop covered the lower side of the outer leaves very well, while also securing statistically equal coverage of the underside of the centre leaves, when compared to all other configurations. Therefore, one of these configurations, a spray boom configuration with TeeJet TP 80 04 EVS nozzles mounted on the horizontal spray boom and TeeJet UB 85 04 nozzles mounted 38 cm long vertical extensions, was selected for the field trial with S. carpocapsae. An adjuvant trial, determined whether S. carpocapsae, applied in the field with this technique, could effectively reduce the cabbage moth numbers in a cauliflower crop and/or the damage to this crop. It also tested if these parameters could be further reduced by adding yeast extract and/or Addit and xanthan gum to the tank suspension. An application rate trial and an application technique trial, were set up (1) to test the effect of different application rates of EPN on cabbage moth control and (2) to confirm if the application technique selected in the spray application tools test was indeed better suited than a standard broadcast spray application, for controlling the cabbage moth. In the adjuvant trial, the numbers of damaged cabbage heads clearly demonstrate a protective effect of spraying with a suspension of S. carpocapsae, when combined with Addit and xanthan gum. It was noticeable that Bt applications outperformed all other treatments, although the difference was not always significant. Based on these results, EPN might provide an extra control option against the cabbage moth, if the efficacy of EPN treatments can be further enhanced. Similar to the adjuvant trial, the numbers of cabbage moth larvae were highly variable between individual plants in both the application rate trial and the application technique trial, making it difficult to distinguish statistical differences between the mean number of caterpillars per plant. However, leaf damage measurements and the number of infected plants proved to be much less variable and thus much more reliable than counting numbers of caterpillars for assessing control by S. carpocapsae and Bt treatments in both trials. Only the Bt applications with the adapted spray boom effectively stopped damage development caused by the cabbage moth. Furthermore, the plots that received Bt with the adapted spray boom were the only plots that contained significantly less infected plants than the control plots. The protection against sunlight on the underside of leaves, together with better placement of the Bt spray may explain the better control of the Bt applications with the adapted spray boom compared with the regular spray boom. This chapter shows that there is much room for improvement in the foliar application of EPN against cabbage moth. Control results were probably largely dependent on the temperature. More cold-tolerant species, strains or breeding products of EPN should be searched for, so that they can be used against the cabbage moth, before any conclusions can be drawn on the optimal application rate of the EPN. The deposition measurements in all trials suffered from high variability. This was most probably caused by the plant architecture of cauliflower: due to the overlap of leaves, some areas of the plant are difficult to spray. This variability is a major concern for biocontrol agents like Bt and EPN, since areas that are not sprayed, are not protected against the targeted pest. When a low temperature active EPN species/strain/breeding product, efficacious against the cabbage moth, becomes available, then EPN applications might be fitted into biological control schemes to prevent development of resistance of cabbage moth against Bt. This is of major importance, since cabbage moth already seems to possess some innate resistance against Bt products. Chapter 4 presents three field tests with applications of IJ of S. feltiae against cabbage root fly in cauliflower. These tests focused on finding an optimal application rate (200, 000 IJ/plant vs. 50, 000 IJ/plant), a suitable application technique (plant tray spraying vs. drench application) and a good timing of the application (application at planting vs. application one week after planting vs. application two weeks after planting, with or without one or two follow-up treatment(s)). The results demonstrated that a plant tray spray with S. feltiae is superior to a drench application in controlling cabbage root fly in cauliflower. Plant tray sprayings with S. feltiae can reduce the percentage of dead plants compared with the non-treated control. The lack of an application rate-effect relationship suggests that it might be possible to further reduce the applied rate of S. feltiae without causing a significant reduction in control. Numbers of <b>cabbage</b> <b>maggots</b> around the plant roots can be temporarily reduced by plant tray sprays with a rate of 200, 000 IJ S. feltiae per cauliflower plant. Mortality results of bait tests with wax moth larvae on soil samples taken from around the cauliflower plants, showed that IJ of S. feltiae, applied as a plant tray spray, take one to two weeks to spread into the soil around the roots of cauliflower. These bait tests also showed that the most effective period of IJ of S. feltiae in the soil is limited up to five weeks, which warrants a follow-up treatment. Further research should examine whether the application rate of IJ of S. feltiae in a plant tray spray can be lowered, while maintaining a good control, and whether a follow-up application of S. feltiae, applied three to five weeks after planting with a better suited technique (e. g., injection), would further improve control of cabbage root fly. Chapter 5 presents two field trials in leek set up to determine and, if possible, to improve the effect of spray applications with S. feltiae against onion thrips in leek. The first trial was carried out on an organic farm and focused on selecting a suitable spray application technique and on testing the effect of an attractant on thrips control. The second trial focused on incorporating spray applications of EPN in a conventional insecticide scheme, and on the effect of mixing the surfactant Addit in the spray suspension on the control of onion thrips. The results show that the selected commercial strain of S. feltiae was not effective against the foliar inhabiting life stages of onion thrips in leek. Mixing a thrips attractant in the spray suspension and spraying with adapted spray equipment (band application and row application) did not improve the efficacy. Compared with the traditional spray boom technique, the row application technique ensured a more even EPN deposition on both the upper side and underside of both old and new leek leaves. This technique offers good potential for improving the applications of fungicides and of contact insecticides in leek. The general discussion in chapter 6 links the obtained results, and suggests directions for future research. The described experimental work with EPN against the cabbage moth, cabbage root fly and onion thrips showed that significant control of the first two pests is certainly possible in outdoor vegetables, but it also showed that there’s still a long way to go before EPN will be applied commercially against these pests in outdoor vegetables. Efficient control of insect pests with EPN requires a perfect match between several factors: the EPN species/strain/breeding product, the pest, the crop, the application (in terms of technique, formulation and application rate) and the environmental conditions. Matching these factors requires the screening and breeding of much more EPN species/strains for different properties (e. g., pathogenicity, temperature tolerance, mobility, drought resistance). In the short term, research on EPN applications against greenhouse pests seems to be the most promising area of research in temperate climates. Only when the prices for EPN drop due to more widespread adoption and when new EPN species/strains/breeding products and application techniques become available, will outdoor applications of EPN become commercially viable. Because pest control with EPN is obviously not a one-size fits-all solution, farmers will need appropriate knowledge to obtain successful pest control with EPN. Moreover, the upcoming EU obligation for farmers to use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) methods to protect their crops will further increase the demand for knowledge on IPM methods. Governmental, NGO and corporate advisory networks will need to be strengthened in order to fulfil this demand and to keep European crops healthy...|$|R

Emergence patterns of F 1 progeny from crosses between early- and later-emerging flies from Scaly Mountain demonstrated that emergence traits were genetically controlled. D. radicum phenology studies in North Carolina suggested that temporal isolation of the two types was halted by an extended period of aestivation during the summer months, which subsequently allowed the two populations to interbreed during the autumn months. The relative proportion of early:late emergers appears to be unstable over time, which may be due to differential mortality factors operating when populations are temporally isolated or due to dominance or recessive factors governing earliness or lateness, or bot...|$|E
40|$|Crucifer root-feeding maggots {{occur in}} field Brassica crops across the prairies, causing the {{greatest}} damage to canola fields {{in central and}} northern Alberta. No chemical options are available for their control in canola. Seed treatments currently utilized for flea beetle control are not efficacious against root maggots, and flies emerge over extended periods, making application of insecticide sprays impractical. Biological and cultural practices are the primary methods of root maggot management in canola. Fall cultivation, the use of vigorous canola cultivars, increased seeding rates, wider row spacings, and suitable fertilization regimes will aid in diminishing root maggot damage. Because natural enemies are an important means of root maggot control, research is needed into co-ordinating cultural management practices with biological control strategies for maximum effectiveness of both strategies and a truly integrated crop management approach to maggot control.

40|$|In 1997 approx. 25 ac. of {{cauliflower}} were {{harvested in}} Minnesota.

Cabbage and broccoli are covered in separate crop profiles for Minnesota. Despite the relatively few acres of cauliflower in the state, the high value of the crop (ca. $ 4, 100 /ac), and traditionally high insecticide use of about 5 - 6 sprays/ season, continues to create a demand for effective integrated pest management (IPM) programs. In response to new IPM information needs generated by the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), this crop profile was developed to a) summarize current IPM practices for insect, disease and weed pests, b) highlight pesticides under review by US-EPA, c) estimate {{the impact of the}} loss of selected pesticides, and d) assess alternatives for such losses.

Climatic data were collected and DDA were calculated using the lower developmental threshold of 4. 3 °C. The efficacy of four insecticides applied either as standard foliar treatment or through dipping the seedlings before transplanting was determined. Seasonal flight activity during the cultivation season of a mid-early variety of white cabbage was correlated with DDA and JD and was characterized by having two peaks. The first peak occurred between 119 ± 7. 5 JD and 125. 5 ± 8 JD when DDA was 471. 35 ± 74. 97 °C. The second occurred between 172. 8 ± 6. 1 JD and 179. 3 ± 6. 7 JD when DDA was 1, 217. 28 ± 96. 12 °C. The DDA, cumulative capture of flies and JD are suitable for predicting the timing of insecticide application. Spraying with insecticides should be applied when the cumulative capture of flies reaches 100 flies/YST and when DDA reaches 400 °C. If only one parameter reaches the threshold, additional visual surveys should be employed to establish the level of infestation. Insecticides were able to ensure only partial control.

The cabbage looper, a lepidopteran migrant from the south, arrives late in the season and usually becomes an additional threat. <b>Cabbage</b> <b>maggot,</b> flea beetle, cabbage aphids, and onion thrips are other insect pests that warrant control measures. Cabbage is also sporadically infected by diseases such as black rot, black leg, downy mildew, club root, and sugar beet cyst nematode, any of which can result in substantial crop loss. Growers must protect their crop from these pests by any means available. Presently, pesticides are the most widely used and effective means of crop protection. However, total reliance upon pesticides, to the exclusion of other control tactics, can be inefficient. Strict adherence to pesticides and regular repetitive spraying may result in: increased pest resistance to pesticides; detrimental effects on non-target organisms; environmental pollution; potential hazard to the pesticide applicator, farm worker, and consumer; spiraling treatment costs; and uneconomical use of energy. Since processing cabbage (for sauerkraut) need not be cosmetically perfect, a certain amount of leaf damage by Lepidoptera or diseases is acceptable. This allows growers to treat sauerkraut cabbage less often than fresh market cabbage (approximately 4 vs 8 sprays/field/season, respectively). Since the return per acre of processed cabbage is considerably less than that of fresh market cabbage ($ 736 and $ 3, 500, respectively), sauerkraut growers must be more economical in their crop protection practices...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{was developed for}} maintaining a stock colony of the <b>cabbage</b> <b>maggot,</b> Delia radicum (Linnaeus), in the greenhouse, A petri dish rearing method producing a high yield of adults was developed for laboratory screening of insect growth regulators against this pest. [...] Topical application of the chitin synthesis inhibitor, diflubenzuron (Dimilin ®), {{at a rate of}} 1. 0 μg per egg significantly reduced hatch of 24 - 28 hour old eggs and caused 100 % mortality of first instar larvae before they could feed on rutabaga slices. Diflubenzuron had no effect on mature larvae or pupae of D. radicum. Methoprene (Alttosid ® 5 E), a juvenile hormone analogue, applied at the same dose, did not adversely affect egg hatch but prevented the eclosion of adults from pupae that subsequently developed from treated eggs. Pupal-adult intermediates were, observed inside treated puparia. Treatment of mature, post-feeding larvae and recently formed pupae with methoprene also produced non-eclosing pupal-adult mosaics. A dose of 0. 05 μg per larva completely suppressed adult eclosion. However, diflubenzuron applied to third instar larvae or pupae did not affect adult eclosion. Juvenile hormone I and the anti-juvenile compound, precocene II, did not affect D. radicum when applied to the egg, larval or pupal stages. [...] Thin-layer chromatography and colorimetric analysis of hemolymph metabolites 36 hours after treatment of post-feeding larvae demonstrated that methoprene caused a significant reduction in trehalose, the predominant carbohydrate in the hemolymph. Methoprene did not disrupt hemolymph amino acid or protein concentrations.

Logarithmically increased dosages between 100 and 100, 000 infective juveniles per plant of S. feltiae (27 strain) linearly reduced the number of D. radicum pupae that developed on potted cabbage plants and the damage caused to the roots by D. radicullarvae.

Soil Guard in its standard yellow color and enhanced with yellow paint were both significantly more attractive to B. brassicae than unmulched control plots. However, when Soil Guard was painted blue, a level of control comparable to that of diazinon was obtained for D. radicum. Weed fabric significantly reduced weed populations, but flea beetle levels in those plots were six times higher than controls. ^ A sensitive trap-lure system was evaluated for monitoring blueberry maggot fly populations. Yellow, green, red, and blue spheres (9 cm diameter) were equal to or better than Pherocon AM yellow boards in attracting blueberry maggot flies. Traps baited with ammonia were significantly more attractive than unbaited traps. More female than male flies were captured on ammonia baited traps which is consistent with findings that Rhagoletis spp. female flies seek a protein source for egg maturation. ^ Varietal trials and blueberry volatiles were evaluated for various blueberry cultivars. Eighteen highbush blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum L., cultivars were evaluated for larval infestation by R. mendax. Significantly fewer maggots were found in berries of early-ripening cultivars, than in later maturing cultivars. The oviposition period of R. mendax is synchronized with the ripening dates of mid-season cultivars in Rhode Island. ^ In 1997, we evaluated the attraction of blueberry maggot flies to blueberry volatiles at various load-rates. The effect of sphere sizes on the capture of bluebefly maggot flies was also investigated. R. mendax flies were attracted to a volatile blend at load-rates of 0. 1 and 0. 3 mg. Load-rates 3 ̆c 0. 03 mg and 3 ̆e 1. 0 mg were not significantly different from controls. More females than males were attracted to volatile blends and volatiles emanating from ripe blueberries.
