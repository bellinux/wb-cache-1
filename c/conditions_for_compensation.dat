40|$|An often {{overlooked}} {{feature of the}} Employees' Compensation Ordinance is that an employee who meets the basic requirements for a claim can nonetheless be denied compensation under certain provisions of the Ordinance, if his misconduct or his contribution to the injury is viewed as sufficiently serious. These provisions are rarely resorted to, but their potential should not be under-estimated. Moreover, these provisions overlap with each other, and contain certain internal contradictions. They also overlap with {{and to some degree}} contradict certain of the provisions establishing the basic qualifying <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>compensation.</b> This article will explore recent and historical case law in which these provisions have been interpreted and applied, and will consider the extent and effect of the overlap between them {{and the extent to which}} they overlap with and contradict the basic qualifying conditions.

40|$|The {{power system}} is very {{advanced}} and complex, {{it is considered}} to be the largest machine ever built in the history of humankind. Its uninterruptable and reliable functioning is the key for further progress of the modern society. The power system includes generation, transportation and consumption of electrical energy and its efficiency on all these stages is determined by losses in the system. Power loss during energy transportation is inversely proportional to the operating voltage. Therefore, the use of higher voltages is desirable. Moreover, with higher voltages it is possible to transport more energy. In order to raise the voltage, transformers are used on both transmission and distribution levels. There are a countless number of them operating around the world. Conventional three-phase transformers are mainly constructed using E-type magnetic cores where magnetic fluxes are generated in each core leg by phase currents flowing in the windings. The arrangement of the core and its non-linear magnetic properties lead to asymmetry and distortion of voltages and/or currents waveforms. In general, presence of harmonics is strongly undesirable due to additional energy losses and their impact on equipment connected to the transformer. One promising way to prevent generation of harmonics in the power system is to arrange the magnetic circuit of a transformer in a special manner that would, e. g., provide <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> or even cancellation of harmonics produced in different phases. Such non-conventional (hexa-core) transformers are manufactured today by the company Hexaformer AB (Västervick, Sweden). Preliminary tests have shown that these machines may have several advantages over traditional technology, in particular, reduced generation of harmonics and better performance in presence of them. The objective of this thesis work is to analyze sources and conditions for generation of harmonics in power distribution transformers and to compare a hexa-core transformer with a conventional E- core transformer. The study is performed by means of computer simulations and experimental studies of the behavior of the machines under different load conditions. The developed computer models are validated with measurements done on real transformers. The data obtained from both measurements and simulations are used to compare the performance of the machines. The results of the work will contribute to further development and better understanding of hexa-core technology...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{extraordinary}} {{properties of}} laser-induced transparency of a negative-index slab and parametric amplification for a backward-wave signal are investigated. The {{effects of the}} idler absorption and phase mismatch on the amplification of the signal are studied, and the feasibility of ensuring robust transparency for {{a broad range of}} control field intensities and slab thicknesses is shown. A particular option consisting of the independent engineering of a strong four-wave mixing response and the negative refractive index is proposed and its specific features are investigated. The feasibility of quantum control over the slab transparency in such a scheme is confirmed through numerical experiments. We thus show opportunities and <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> the <b>compensation</b> of the strong absorption inherent to plasmonic negative-index metamaterials, and we further show achievable transparency through coherent energy transfer from the control optical field to the negative-index signal...|$|R

40|$|The {{criterion}} {{for the design}} of a temperature-compensated reference electrode for non-isothermal galvanic sensors is deduced from the basic flux equations of irreversible thermodynamics. It is shown that when the Seebeck coefficient of the non-isothermal cell using a solid oxygen ion-conducting electrolyte under pure oxygen is equal to the relative partial molar entropy of oxygen in the reference electrode divided by 4 F, then the EMF of the non-isothermal cell is {{the same as that of}} an isothermal cell with the same electrodes operating at the higher temperature. By measuring the temperature of the melt alone and the EMF of the non-isothermal galvanic sensor, one can derive the chemical potential or the concentration of oxygen in a corrosive medium. The theory is experimentally checked using sensors for oxygen in liquid copper constructed with various metal+oxide electrodes and fully stabilised (CaO) ZrO 2 as the electrolyte. To satisfy the exact <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> temperature <b>compensation</b> it is often necessary to have the metal or oxide as a solid solution in the reference electrode...|$|R

Also, the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> a <b>compensation</b> are not considered and it is not dynamic. In some business scenarios, e. g. a complex production process involving several partners, compensation is a commitment under certain conditions. These conditions in turn can be dynamic and interdependent. Often, a lot of human effort is required to perform compensation.

Especially in highly dynamic environment this enables on the one hand a dynamic compensation, and on the other it can support human decision finding in case of failure...|$|R
30|$|Against expectations, being SINGLE has a {{positive}} effect on the unemployment probability. This might be explained by <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> receiving unemployment <b>compensation.</b> The compensation amount is based on requirements of so-called “Bedarfsgemeinschaften” (needs-based-households) following the principle of subsidiary. Unemployment compensation can only be claimed if the sum of income earned by all household members is too low to ensure subsistence level. Since the Hartz reforms, people under 25 years of age are considered to belong to the “Bedarfsgemeinschaft” of their parents. The intention of this reform was to avoid moving out of the parental home only to be entitled to higher unemployment compensation. The same incentive may often apply for couples. The marginal effect of the HH-SIZE variable is positive which is counterintuitive concerning the positive SINGLE variable. Thus, it is the smallest marginal effect of the determinants of unemployment.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} the stock market’s {{capacity}} to aggregate dispersed informa-tion is connected to CEO incentives. In particular, I highlight several informational inefficiencies associated with giving the CEO stock-based compensation and thus discretion when choosing corporate investment. While this scheme leads to high effort provision in equilibrium, it suffers from amplified noise in the stock price and an excessive use of price information (relative to the constrained efficient bench-mark). As a result, stock prices under this compensation mechanism are excessively volatile and exposed to non-fundamental noise. I then compare this incentive struc-ture to a flat wage & fixed investment rule {{environment in which the}} firm owners specify an ex ante optimal rule for the CEO. It follows, that the equilibrium out-come demonstrates undistorted price efficiency, but no incentive for the CEO to invest in a profitable growth opportunity.

40|$|Background: A health {{certificate}} {{is required to}} work on the offshore petroleum installations of the Norwegian Shelf. Loss of {{health certificate}} (“loss of licence”, LOL) may cause economic problems for the individual worker. A private compensation system (OSO) was established for Norwegian offshore workers in 2002, comprising 8000 – 11, 000 individual members of workers organisations: approximately one third of the population offshore. This study aims at describing the reasons <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> of offshore workers who have lost their certificates. Materials and methods: Of 595 workers who applied <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> in the period 2002 – 2010, 38 declined to participate in the study. Of the remaining 557, 507 were granted and 50 were denied compensation. All medical records held by the scheme concerning the 507 compensated applicants were examined. Health data were systematically extracted, analysed, and compared with general population statistics. Results: Musculoskeletal conditions were the most frequent <b>conditions</b> causing LOL <b>for</b> both sexes (42. 5 %), followed by psychiatric, neurological, and malignant diseases for women, and cardiovascular (19 %), neurological, and psychiatric <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> men. Musculoskeletal disorders were more prevalent than in the general population, and the prevalence of knee problems was particularly high. Among malignant diseases we found a high proportion of brain tumours and renal cancer. The causes are unknown and warrant further investigation in this population. Among women granted compensation, 78 % were catering workers, while 50 % of the men were process workers, reflecting the gender distribution in these working groups. Conclusions: Musculoskeletal conditions were the most frequent cause of application <b>for</b> LOL <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> both sexes, followed by psychiatric, neurological, and malignant diseases for women, and cardiovascular, neurological, and psychiatric <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> men. The cause of the higher incidence of musculoskeletal diseases, brain tumours, and renal cancer found in this study compared to the general population warrants further investigation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Gun {{performance}} is usually {{affected by the}} operating temperature of the ammunition or weapon. This is caused by several factors, amongst which the temperature dependency of the propellant ignition and combustion processes. Compensation of temperature effects on weapon or ammunition {{performance is}} possible if these processes are controllable. As the output of plasma igniters depends on the delivered electrical energy, application of plasma ignition facilitates in principle the possibility {{to compensate for the}} temperature effects. Computer simulations show that compensation of propellant temperature effects can be achieved if the initial ignition conditions can be regulated. The feasibility of this principle was verified experimentally. A plasma igniter was designed and manufactured, and ignition experiments were carried out using a closed bomb and a gun simulator. The results show that application of plasma ignition results in a significant reduction of the level and variability of the ignition delay and that variation of the electrical energy results in the desired controllability of the ignition conditions. From the obtained results it is concluded that regulation of the combustion <b>conditions,</b> as required <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> of weapon and ammunition conditions, can be obtained by the application of the developed plasma igniter.
