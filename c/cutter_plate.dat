40|$|The {{objective}} of the invention is to facilitate the cutting of soil layers from a soil probe in an uncomplicated manner, said soil probe being treated previously in the lysimeter. According to the invention, a cutting device is provided with a cutting table (5) having a base frame (6) and a <b>cutter</b> <b>plate</b> configuration (7) and a depositing device (10) below the <b>cutter</b> <b>plate</b> configuration (7). The sample holder (1) containing the soil sample (3) {{is placed on the}} <b>cutter</b> <b>plate</b> configuration (7) and, after lowering the soil sample (3) onto the depositing device (10) by opening the <b>cutter</b> <b>plate</b> configuration (7), a soil layer (2) is cut from the soil sample (3). The invention is used for investigating soil samples...|$|E
40|$|Adhesive {{processes}} {{define the}} character of chips formation and a tool-wear rate. As {{a result of the}} investigation of chip inner surfaces and a cutting face of the tangential cutting plate of LNMX (LNUX) 301940 type (of different manufacturers including Sandvik coromant, Korloy, Kennenmetel, Pramet) after recovery turning a tread of railway thermo-strengthened wheel pairs it is established that there is a possibility of the process control in minimization of continuous chips formation based on the account of peculiarities in the adhesion interaction of the material under machining and the cutting one; a conditional chart of the distribution of bifurcation centers on deformation-energetic scales of tool material and chips is formed; there is developed a <b>cutter</b> <b>plate</b> of the own design minimizing a possibility of continuous chips formation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The short {{shelf-life}} and bulkiness of cassava roots pose a great {{problem in}} transporting these roots {{from the farm}} to the market or factory sites. To overcome this difficulty in the marketing and utilization of cassava and to avoid heavy post-harvest losses, the roots need to be processed into some form of dried product with longer shelf life. The simplest and most common mode of processing cassava is {{the conversion of the}} roots into dry chips. Cassava processing into chips by traditional methods which involve the use of knife is labour- intensive but the application of improved processing technology has reduced processing time and labour and encouraged further production. An improved cassava chipping machine, with chip thickness between 3 - 6 mm was designed to enhance the processing of cassava into chips to catalyze its drying period and preserve its nutritional value. The chipping machine consists of a hopper, a <b>cutter</b> <b>plate</b> and a power transmission system powered by a 1 hp electric motor. Computer Aided Design software was used in the design and appropriate material selection was considered for its fabrication. The cassava chipping machine was also simulated for stress analysis and behaviour of the machine was studied when loaded virtually. Chipping efficiency is 94. 75 %, machine capacity is 0. 04 kg/sec, chipping rate is 0. 034 kg/sec which {{is a function of the}} force applied...|$|E
50|$|Voet {{was very}} {{successful}} as engraver and publisher. Around 1665 he employed between 60 and 70 workers who were illuminators, <b>plate</b> <b>cutters,</b> printers etc. This large workshop allowed Voet {{to carry out the}} entire printing and publishing activity in his workshop.|$|R
50|$|Kotli Loharan {{consists}} of two subtowns. One is Kotli Loharan West (Laandi (meaning West) Kotli) and other is called Kotli Lohraran East (Chardi (meaning East) Kotli). All kinds of articles for use and ornament are made, such as shields and arms, betel-nut <b>cutters,</b> knives, boxes, <b>plates,</b> inkstands, and so on. The material used is iron, and gold and silver are used in inlaying.|$|R
50|$|Upon further investigation, it was {{revealed}} that Cutter had previously assaulted another woman on November 26, 1990. A witness reported seeing Cutter in a Mazda with Oregon license <b>plates.</b> <b>Cutter</b> revealed that he was a resident of Newberg, Oregon and lived in a motel in the town when he was not on the road. Fearing that he was a serial killer, police issued a bulletin for Oregon and Washington for Seth Scott Cutter. Detectives in Newberg recognized Cutter, but knew him as Scott William Cox, his real name. He was charged and convicted of forgery for creating fake identification under a pseudonym. Around the same time, he was also charged and convicted of gun theft in Medford, Oregon in November 1991, and he served a six-month jail sentence. Newberg detectives opened a murder investigation into Cox in 1991 and he ultimately confessed to the murder of Rheena Ann Brunson. Cox claimed he was mad at his girlfriend and wanted to release his anger by beating a prostitute. After drinking whiskey and snorting cocaine, he picked up Brunson in his car and then began beating her. As she attempted to escape, Cox stabbed her once in the heart, left her for dead, and drove away. He also confessed to the murder of Victoria Rhone and to beating several other women, but denied killing anyone else.|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of artistic prints in the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Netherlands was an inherently social process. Turning out prints at any reasonable scale {{depended on the}} fluid coordination between designers, platecutters, and publishers; roles that, by the sixteenth century, were considered distinguished enough to merit distinct credits engraved on the plates themselves: invenit, fecit/sculpsit, and excudit. While any one designer, <b>plate</b> <b>cutter,</b> and publisher could potentially exercise {{a great deal of}} influence over the {{production of}} a single print, their individual decisions (Whom to select as an engraver? What subjects to create for a print design? What market to sell to?) would have been variously constrained or encouraged by their position in this larger network (Who do they already know? And who, in turn, do their contacts know?) This dissertation addresses the impact of these constraints and affordances through the novel application of computational social network analysis to major databases of surviving prints from this period. This approach is used to evaluate several questions about trends in early modern print production practices that have not been satisfactorily addressed by traditional literature based on case studies alone: Did the social capital demanded by print production result in centralized, or distributed production of prints? When, and to what extent, did printmakers and publishers in the Low countries favor international versus domestic collaborators? And were printmakers under the same pressure as painters to specialize in particular artistic genres? This dissertation ultimately suggests how simple professional incentives endemic to the practice of printmaking may, at large scales, have resulted in quite complex patterns of collaboration and production. The framework of network analysis surfaces the role of certain printmakers who tend to be neglected in aesthetically-focused histories of art. This approach also highlights important issues concerning art historians’ balancing of individual influence versus the impact of longue durée trends. Finally, this dissertation also raises questions about the current limitations and future possibilities of combining computational methods with cultural heritage datasets in the pursuit of historical research...|$|R
