40|$|Abstract: During the {{construction}} phase, {{participants in a}} multi-contract project acquire external real-time scheduling information from other involved parties and use this to make appropriate decisions in regard to project control. There are two major obstacles to project participants gaining efficient access to external information in a distributed data environment: (1) the variety of data structures that project members may use, and (2) lack of an automatic mechanism for data acquisition. Based on the ontology defined by eXtensible markup language Schema (XML Schema) and an automatic mechanism <b>called</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Transfer</b> Chain (MTC), an Electronic Acquisition Model for Project Scheduling (e-AMPS) centralized in an information agent, Message Agent (MA), was developed. Each participant equips a Message Agent as his unique information window to automatically acquire external information and provide other participants with scheduling information as well. The ultimate goal {{of this study is}} to build an automatic communication environment for multi-contract projects to solve the abovementioned difficulties, and thus achieve effective communication among project participants...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—M-commerce is {{the buying}} and selling of goods and {{services}} using wireless handheld devices such as cellular telephone and personal digital assistants. One of the main concerns in m-commerce is the lack of verified authentication and key establishment protocols that are secure against fraud, counterfeit, and theft in mobile electronic transactions. In this report, the current m-commerce authentication protocols are studied and one of them named NAETEA is verified formally using Murphi, which is a formal verification tool. The result of formal verification of this protocol shows that it is secure against the attacks in which attacker can replay the previously <b>transferred</b> <b>messages</b> or generate messages using some components of previously <b>transferred</b> <b>messages.</b> I...|$|R

30|$|IEC 62351 {{suggests}} that the confidentiality of MMS is provided by TLS protocol but does not specify details about it, and TLS has deficiencies in real time. In addition, there are different communication services of MMS messages in intelligent substations, such as the device status <b>message</b> and file <b>transfer</b> <b>message.</b> The device status message is a medium-speed message whereas the file <b>transfer</b> <b>message</b> is a low-speed message. They have different requirements of real-time performance for communication services. Therefore, in this paper, different security measures are designed for different services of MMS messages to ensure their confidentiality after considering their real-time requirements: low-speed messages adopt the modified TLS proposed in this paper; medium-speed messages adopt the method of signature-then-encryption on the sending side and decryption-then-authentication on the receiving side. Compared with the RSA algorithm, SM 2 has the advantages of higher security, faster operation, and less resource consumption, so we select SM 2 as the algorithm of authentication and encryption.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In 2007, Camenisch, Neven and Shelat {{proposed}} an adaptive oblivious transfer (OT) {{in which a}} sender has N messages, of which a receiver can adaptively choose to receive k one-after-the-other. In this paper, we show that the scheme has a drawback that the sender can only serve a single receiver only once. The drawback results from the deterministic encryption used. To fix it, we suggest to replace the deterministic encryption with a probabilistic encryption. The OT scheme adopts the paradigm of “encryption and proof of knowledge ” in order to force the sender to keep {{the consistency of the}} <b>transferred</b> <b>messages.</b> We remark that the paradigm is unnecessary. In most reasonable applications of OT, the <b>transferred</b> <b>messages</b> must be recognizable for the receiver or the sender is willing to disclose some messages to the receiver. This property has been explicitly specified in the earlier works by Rabin, Even, Goldreich and Lempel...|$|R

We aimed in this dissertation thesis on improvements in end-to-end communication between two VANET nodes by means of proposing a new application-level communication protocol that is specialised on transferring large object structures. In order to minimise size of <b>transferred</b> <b>message,</b> the protocol makes use of the information about the structure that both communicating parties already share. The protocol uses UDP as an end-to-end datagram transportation service, because it is, according to our simulation results, more efficient than TCP. In order not to waste successfully received datagrams, the proposed protocol uses addressing that allows processing of independently received datagrams and using their contents for reconstructing the <b>transferred</b> <b>message.</b> In case of not receiving all the datagrams the message cannot be reconstructed completely, its missing parts are exactly denoted so that a receiving application is able to make use of at least the received part...|$|R
