50|$|It {{was quite}} {{advanced}} in some ways, using hydraulic disc brakes {{both at the}} front and back as well as a 6 valve head. In other ways, however, it was harking back to the late '70s with its retro styling, semi automatic <b>camchain</b> tensioner and balancer system.|$|E
5000|$|This model {{featured}} a self-adjusting (rather than manually-adjusted) <b>camchain</b> tensioner. For US-only models, an air injection system for emissions reduction was fitted. This model {{was the first}} Kawasaki to use all-weather sintered disc pads and drilled brake discs to improve braking in the wet. A derivative version, the KZ650SR had [...] "chopper styling" [...] with a fat 16-inch rear wheel.|$|E
50|$|The engine had a duplex <b>camchain</b> {{rather than}} the more common inverted-tooth type. Frame numbers started JC05-50 for the 1982-5 CM125CC and JC05-51 for the 1985-6 CM125CF. The {{appearance}} of this model, greatly enhanced by its substantial-looking twin cylinder engine, meant it enjoyed particular popularity in the United Kingdom, where learner motorcyclists are by law restricted to machines of 125 cc and below until they pass their riding test and obtain a full licence. The CM125 Custom was deleted from Honda's United Kingdom line-up in 1986. It continued to be manufactured and sold in Europe and Singapore as the CM125CN (1992, frame numbers (JC05) 5500023-5505185), CM125CP (1993, frame numbers (JC05) 5600001-5608387), CM125CR (1994-1998, frame numbers (JC05) 5700001-5999999) and CM125CX (1999, frame numbers (JH2JC05A*/JH2JC05B*) XK000001-XK099999). Its continuing popularity eventually led to another 125cc custom model being introduced, the Honda CA125 Rebel.|$|E
50|$|The CM250TB {{is based}} on the Honda Superdream CB250N engine but with a {{five-speed}} and not six-speed gearbox. The model is instead characterised by its North American cruiser styling with stepped seat, high handlebars, 'megaphone' exhaust silencers, teardrop-shaped tank and many chromium-plated and polished alloy parts. The quality of the chromium finish and polished alloy meant corrosion was a problem, the outside of the engine casings becoming white and furring up in damp or winter conditions. Particularly vulnerable to deterioration in finish was the exhaust system balance box. Moreover, the front disc brake was also noted as likely to seize as a result of low resistance to corrosion. For the 1982 and 1984 production years, CM250C had a chain drive whilst in the 1983 production year it featured a belt drive. The CM250T has an inverted tooth type <b>camchain</b> and was fitted with Honda Comstar cast alloy wheels as standard.|$|E
