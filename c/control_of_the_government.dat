5|$|Alcibiades, however, did {{not succeed}} in persuading the satrap to ally with the Athenians, and, to hide this fact, demanded (claiming to be {{speaking}} for Tissaphernes) greater and greater concessions of them until they finally refused to comply. Disenchanted with Alcibiades but still determined to overthrow the democracy, Peisander and his companions returned to Samos, where the conspirators worked to secure their control over the army and encouraged a group of native Samian oligarchs to begin planning the overthrow of their own city's democracy. In Athens, meanwhile, a party of young oligarchic revolutionaries succeeded in gaining de facto <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> through assassination and intimidation.|$|E

Constance succeeded her father, who fell in battle, at the age of two, {{although}} his cousin, Roger II of Sicily, laid claim to Antioch. Her mother assumed the regency, but the Antiochene noblemen replaced her with her father (Constance's grandfather), Baldwin II of Jerusalem.

5|$|Grosmont's uncle, Thomas of Lancaster, {{was the son}} and heir of Edward I's brother Edmund Crouchback. Through his {{inheritance}} and a fortunate marriage, Thomas {{became the}} wealthiest peer in England, but constant quarrels with King Edward II led to his execution in 1322. Having no heir, Thomas's possessions and titles went to his younger brother Henry – Grosmont's father. Earl Henry of Lancaster assented to the deposition of Edward II in 1327, but did not long stay in favour with the regency of Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer.

5|$|In 1919, Hess {{enrolled}} in the University of Munich, where he studied geopolitics under Karl Haushofer, a proponent {{of the concept of}} Lebensraum ("living space"), which later became one of the pillars of Nazi Party (National Socialist German Workers Party; NSDAP) ideology. Hess joined the NSDAP on 1 July 1920, and was at Hitler's side on 8 November 1923 for the Beer Hall Putsch, a failed Nazi attempt to seize <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of Bavaria. Whilst serving time in jail for this attempted coup, Hess helped Hitler write his book, Mein Kampf, which became a foundation of the political platform of the NSDAP.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{had made}} clear {{his belief that}} Kenya should become a one-party state, {{regarding}} this as a better expression of national unity than a multi-party system. In {{the first five years}} of independence, he consolidated his control of the central government, seeking to prevent the entrenchment of tribal power bases by removing the autonomy of the country's provinces. He argued that centralised <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> was needed to deal with the growth in demands for local services and to assist more rapid economic development. In 1966, it launched a commission to examine reforms to local government operations. In 1969, it passed the Transfer of Functions Act, which stopped grants to local authorities and transferred major services from provincial to central control.|$|E

5|$|Officials at {{the court}} of Emperor Ai of Han (r. 7–1 BC) {{attempted}} to implement reforms limiting the amount of land nobles and wealthy landowners could own legally, but were unsuccessful. When Wang Mang took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> in 9 AD, he abolished the purchase and sale of land in a system called King's Fields (王田). This was {{a variation of the}} well-field system, where the government owned the land and assured every peasant an equal share to cultivate. Within three years, complaints from wealthy landowners and nobles forced Wang Mang to repeal the reform. After Gengshi (r. 23–25 AD) and Guangwu (r. 25–57 AD) restored the Han dynasty, they relied on the service of great landholding families to secure their position in society. Many of their government officials also became wealthy landowners.|$|E
5|$|Singapore's Prime Minister is the Head of the Government of Singapore. The President {{appoints}} as Prime Minister an MP who, in his judgment, {{is likely}} to command the confidence {{of a majority of}} the MPs. This is a power that the President exercises in his personal discretion. The President then acts in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister to appoint other Ministers from among the Members of Parliament.

5|$|The 1872 gubernatorial {{election}} {{resulted in}} a narrow victory for Minstrel Elisha Baxter over Brindle Tail Joseph Brooks in an election marked by fraud and intimidation. Brooks challenged the result through legal means, initially without success, but Baxter alienated much of his base by re-enfranchising former Confederates and in 1874, Brooks was declared governor by a county judge who declared {{the results of the}} election to have been fraudulent. Brooks took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> by force, but Baxter refused to resign. Each side was supported by its own militia of several hundred Black men. Several bloody battles ensued between the two factions. Finally, President Ulysses S. Grant reluctantly intervened and supported Governor Baxter, bringing the affair to an end.|$|E

5|$|After the {{resignation}} of the last Liberal Cabinet, PedroII invited the rival Conservative Party to form a new cabinet. With his party no longer in control, Paranhos lost much of his influence. The Liberal Party was not willing to accept its loss of power. The most radical faction of the Liberals in the province of Pernambuco, known as the Partido da Praia ("Party of the Beach"), openly advocated a rebellion. Nominally Liberal, the praieiros were associated with the Courtier Faction. The proposed rebellion would be an attempt of this branch of the Courtier Faction to regain <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>government.</b> The praieiros had little support, and public opinion was also against them. The group was unable to convince {{the vast majority of the}} population that a revolt would bring them any benefits. On 2 February 1849, the limited uprising of the praieiros was completely defeated after attacking Recife, the capital of Pernambuco. Even though Paranhos had condemned it, the Praiera rebellion, combined with the downfalls of his patron and the Liberal Party, made a continued political career impossible. He turned his focus once again to his work in journalism.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of Bannockburn, however, Arundel's loyalty began to shift back towards the king. Edward's {{rapprochement}} towards the earl had in fact started earlier, when on 2 November 1313, the king pardoned Arundel's royal debts. The most significant factor in this process though, was the marriage alliance between Arundel and the king's new favourites, the Despensers. Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father Hugh Despenser the elder were gradually taking over <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> and using their power to enrich themselves. While this alienated most of the nobility, Arundel's situation was different. At some point in 1314–1315, his son Richard was betrothed to Isabel, daughter of Hugh Despenser the Younger. Now that he found himself back in royal favour, Arundel started receiving rewards {{in the form of}} official appointments. In 1317 he was appointed Warden of the Marches of Scotland, and in August 1318, he helped negotiate the Treaty of Leake, which temporarily reconciled the king with Thomas of Lancaster.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of his trap-shooting career, Bain {{developed}} an appreciation for nature. He bought an ownership share of the Portage Country Club, on the Delta Marsh near the south shore of Lake Manitoba, and later donated the land to Ducks Unlimited. Bain built the Mallard Lodge as a personal retreat on land adjacent to the club. He strictly enforced his privacy, even building a road to his lodge that he allowed no one else to use; members of the Portage Country Club were required to take a different route. Bain intended to donate his lodge to the government of Manitoba for preservation, though he died before he could do so. The lodge passed into the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> regardless, and was donated to the University of Manitoba as a research facility in 1966 that remains active today.

5|$|In 1819 Buenos Aires was at {{war with}} José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao López, and {{requested}} San Martín and Belgrano to return with their armies {{to take part in}} the conflict. San Martín refused to do so, but Belgrano accepted. However, before his arrival the governors Estanislao López and Juan José Viamonte signed an eight-day truce to start peace negotiations. Belgrano's health was in a very bad state by this point, but he refused to resign, thinking that the morale of the Army would suffer without his presence. He moved to the frontier between Santa Fe and Córdoba, from where he would be able to move to either the litoral or the north if needed. His health continued to worsen, and he was given an unlimited leave from work by the Supreme Director. He handed command to Fernández de la Cruz and moved to Tucumán, where he met his daughter Manuela Mónica, just one year old. The governor of Tucuman, Feliciano de la Motta, was deposed during his stay, and Belgrano was taken prisoner. Abraham González led the uprising and attempted to put Belgrano into a shrew's fiddle, but Belgrano's doctor Josef Redhead objected, because of his delicate health, and his sentence was changed to simple imprisonment. When Bernabé Araoz took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of Tucumán, Belgrano was immediately released.|$|E
5|$|In Donald Nicol's opinion, had Kantakouzenos {{remained}} at Constantinople, his authority might have remained secure. As the megas domestikos and regent however, {{he had the}} duty {{of dealing with the}} Empire's various enemies, who sought to take advantage of Andronikos' death. Dušan had invaded Macedonia, the Emir of Saruhan raided the coasts of Thrace, and Tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria threatened war. In July Kantakouzenos left the capital {{at the head of the}} army, leaving <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> to Apokaukos, whom he still believed loyal to him. Kantakouzenos' campaign proved successful. He persuaded Dušan to withdraw and repulsed the Turkish raiders, while Ivan Alexander, threatened by a fleet from the Emirate of Aydin, renewed his peace treaty with Byzantium. To crown this success, Kantakouzenos received an embassy of the Latin barons of the Principality of Achaea in the Morea. They expressed readiness to surrender the country in exchange for a guarantee of their property and rights. It was a unique opportunity, as Kantakouzenos himself recognized in his memoirs, since if successful, the Catalan-controlled Duchy of Athens was bound to follow, consolidating Byzantine control over Greece.|$|E
