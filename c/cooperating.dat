40|$|Deciding {{whether a}} service S can be {{substituted}} by another service S 0 is an important problem in practice {{and one of the}} research challenges in service-oriented computing. In this paper, we define three substitutability notions for services. Accordance specifies that S 0 <b>cooperates</b> with at least the environments that S <b>cooperates</b> with. S and S 0 are equivalent if they <b>cooperate</b> with the same environments. To guarantee that S 0 <b>cooperates</b> with a fixed subset of environments that S <b>cooperates</b> with, the notion of deprecation can be used. For each substitutability notion we present a decision algorithm. To this end we apply the concept of an operating guideline of a service as an abstract representation of all environments the service <b>cooperates</b> with...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{selection}} favours {{genes that}} increase an organism’s {{ability to survive}} and reproduce. This would appear {{to lead to a}} world dominated by selfish behaviour. However, cooperation can be found at all levels of biological organisation: genes <b>cooperate</b> in genomes, organelles <b>cooperate</b> to form eukaryotic cells, cells <b>cooperate</b> to make multicellular organisms, bacterial parasites <b>cooperate</b> to overcome host defences, animals breed cooperatively, and humans and insects <b>cooperate</b> to build societies. Over the last 40 years, biologists have developed a theoretical framework that can explain cooperation at all these levels. Here, we summarise this theory, illustrate how it may be applied to real organisms and discuss future directions...|$|R
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Kriegsmarine planned Operation Wikinger in {{cooperation}} with the Luftwaffe in the erroneous belief that the British fishing trawlers off the Dogger Bank were <b>cooperating</b> with submarines.

The Luftwaffe promised fighter cover for the ships engaged in the operation as well as bomber support.|$|E

Piattoli, through Czartoryski, briefly worked in the diplomatic service and administration of the Russians, too.

On hearing about Köten's fate, his Cumans decided to leave Hungary and destroyed many villages on their way towards the Balkan Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Evolution {{influences}} {{every aspect}} of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by <b>cooperating</b> with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.|$|E

That September, Italian authorities sent him to an internment camp in Italy after the oubreak of an anti-fascist revolt.
