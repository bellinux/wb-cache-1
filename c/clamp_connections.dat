5|$|The European species Mycena viridimarginata is {{somewhat}} similar to M.intersecta in appearance, {{but may be}} distinguished by its greenish-edged gills, cheilocystidia with abruptly tapering points, and <b>clamp</b> <b>connections.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma vernaticum is {{classified}} in the subgenus Contextocutis of the genus Tricholoma on account of its <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> and interwoven hyphae in the cap cuticle.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius funalis {{differs from}} its closest relative, M.liquidambari, {{due to the}} {{presence}} of cheilocystidia, the lack of <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> {{and the fact that the}} caulocystidia of M.liquidambari do not form bristles; instead, they are club shaped to cylindrical. The species is known from Mexico and Papua New Guinea. M.hudonii, known from Europe, is similar in appearance to M.funalis. However, the former has a cap covered in hairs or bristles, and differs microscopically; for instance, the hyphae feature <b>clamp</b> <b>connections.</b> The Malagasy species Setulipes funaliformis was named after M.funalis due to the morphological similarities between the two. The species can be differentiated by the fact that the basidiospores of S.funalformis are slightly larger and narrower, measuring from 7 to 10 by 3.5 to 4.5μm, and the caulocystidia of M.funalis are significantly longer.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in basidiomycetes {{is similar}} to that of the ascomycetes. Compatible haploid hyphae fuse to produce a dikaryotic mycelium. However, the dikaryotic phase is more extensive in the basidiomycetes, often also present in the vegetatively growing mycelium. A specialized anatomical structure, called a <b>clamp</b> <b>connection,</b> is formed at each hyphal septum. As with the structurally similar hook in the ascomycetes, the <b>clamp</b> <b>connection</b> in the basidiomycetes is required for controlled transfer of nuclei during cell division, to maintain the dikaryotic stage with two genetically different nuclei in each hyphal compartment. A basidiocarp is formed in which club-like structures known as basidia generate haploid basidiospores after karyogamy and meiosis. The most commonly known basidiocarps are mushrooms, but they may also take other forms (see Morphology section).|$|R
50|$|Stereum {{species are}} wood decay fungi {{that do not}} have tubes. They are simply small bracket-shaped {{membranes}} appearing on dead wood. The underside of the membrane contains spores but no ornament, i.e. gills, of any kind. Like most members in the family, Stereums lack <b>clamp</b> <b>connection</b> and have amyloid spores.|$|R
5|$|The {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Cryptothecia has been unclear, and historically, C.rubrocincta has been placed in several different genera. Like all lichens, C.rubrocincta is an association of a fungus (the mycobiont) with a photosynthetic organism (the photobiont), in this case, an algae. Initially, it was unknown whether the mycobiont component of C.rubrocincta was an ascomycete or a basidiomycete. Although {{the vast majority of}} lichen mycobionts are from the Ascomycota, in 1937 German lichenogist Friedrich Tobler believed the mycobiont to be a basidiomycete, because he interpreted some unusual microscopic structures to be <b>clamp</b> <b>connections,</b> structures associated only with the basidiomycete fungi. In another publication later that year, he specified the mycobiont to be a hymenomycete, and described the monotypic genus Herpothallion to supersede the old name Chiodecton sanguineum. Although Vernon Ahmadjian corroborated the presence of <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> in the species when he studied the species' cytology in 1967, other researchers did not find <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> in specimens collected from different countries. Further doubt was cast on the possibility of a basidiomycete mycobiont with the discovery of the depside confluentic acid in 1966, concentric bodies in 1975, and woronin bodies in 1983, as all of these characteristics are restricted to Ascomycetes.|$|E
5|$|All Russulaceae, {{including}} the corticioid species, are characterised by spherical to elliptic basidiospores {{with a faint}} to very distinct (e.g. warty, spiny, or crested) ornamentation that stains bluish-black with Melzer's reagent (an amyloid stain reaction). Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are usually club-shaped and four-spored. Russulaceae species do not have <b>clamp</b> <b>connections.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amanita australis {{mushrooms}} {{that have}} lost their warts and have had the colours faded may resemble another New Zealand species, A.nothofagi. The two species may be distinguished reliably using microscopy—A.nothofagi does not have <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> {{at the base of}} the basidia, unlike A.australis.A.australis also bears some resemblance to the eastern North American and east Asian species A.abrupta, which also has an abruptly bulbous stem base.|$|E
50|$|R. glutinis is an aerobic yeast {{characterized}} by pink, smooth colonies with a moist appearance. Reproduction is typically by multipolar budding although pseudohyphae are occasionally produced. Sexual reproduction is by basidiospores arising from a teliospore developed from a mycelial <b>clamp</b> <b>connection.</b> A distinguishing {{feature of the}} species and its close relatives are the intense yellow and red pigments produced during growth on most substrates.|$|R
50|$|A <b>clamp</b> <b>connection</b> is a hook-like {{structure}} {{formed by}} growing hyphal cells of certain fungi. It is created to ensure each cell, or segment of hypha separated by septa (cross walls), receives {{a set of}} differing nuclei, which are obtained through mating of hyphae of differing sexual types. It is used to create genetic variation within the hypha much like the mechanisms found in crozier during sexual reproduction.|$|R
50|$|Unlike copper, {{aluminium}} has {{a tendency}} to creep or cold-flow under pressure, so older plain steel screw <b>clamped</b> <b>connections</b> could become loose over time. Newer electrical devices designed for aluminum conductors have features intended to compensate for this effect. Unlike copper, aluminium forms an insulating oxide layer on the surface. This is sometimes addressed by coating aluminium conductors with an antioxidant paste (containing zinc dust in a low-residue polybutene base) at joints, or by applying a mechanical termination designed to break through the oxide layer during installation.|$|R
5|$|Amanita ceciliae {{was first}} {{described}} by Miles Joseph Berkeley, an English cryptogamist and clergyman, and Christopher Edmund Broome, a British mycologist, in 1854. It {{is placed in}} the genus Amanita and section Vaginatae. Section Vaginatae consists of mushrooms with special characteristics – such as the absence of a ring, and very few <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> at the bases of the basidia.|$|E
5|$|Mycena mustea {{is similar}} to the North American species M.umbrinovinosa, which is {{distinguished}} by having a vinaceous-brown to purplish-black cap, irregularly shaped cheilocystidia that are covered at their tips with long, flexuous excrescences, and <b>clamp</b> <b>connections.</b> Mycena mustea is also similar to the European species M.urania, which differs in its blackish-violet cap, broadly club-shaped cheilocystidia covered with numerous, evenly spaced warts, and <b>clamp</b> <b>connections.</b> Mycena mustea also resembles the Japanese M.fonticola, a species described concurrently with M.mustea. Unlike that of M.fonticola, the cap of M.mustea typically becomes pale grayish-purple when mature; the cheilocystidia have several short finger-like excrescences at their tips; and the stem cuticle is made up of smooth hyphae. In contrast, the cap of M.fonticola becomes dark violet-brown when mature; there are no excrescences on the cheilocystidia; and the hyphae of the stem cuticle are sparsely covered with diverticulae that resemble warts or fingers.|$|E
5|$|The broadly {{ellipsoid}} {{to roughly}} spherical spores are 5.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5μm. Their surfaces {{are covered with}} small rounded bumps. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–30 by 6–7.5μm. The hyphae of the flesh are brownish with thin walls, and measure 4–6μm; hyphae in the spines are thin-walled, septate, and sometimes branched, measuring 3.5–4.5μm. The hyphae do not have <b>clamp</b> <b>connections.</b>|$|E

50|$|Basidiomycota are {{filamentous}} fungi {{composed of}} hyphae (except for basidiomycota-yeast; refer yeast for more information) and reproduce sexually via {{the formation of}} specialized club-shaped end cells called basidia that normally bear external meiospores (usually four). These specialized spores are called basidiospores. However, some Basidiomycota reproduce asexually in addition or exclusively. Basidiomycota that reproduce asexually (discussed below) can be recognized as members of this division by gross similarity to others, by {{the formation of a}} distinctive anatomical feature (the <b>clamp</b> <b>connection</b> - see below), cell wall components, and definitively by phylogenetic molecular analysis of DNA sequence data.|$|R
5|$|The gill {{tissue is}} made of {{thin-walled}} hyphae containing a septum, which are hyaline to pale yellow, and measure 3–15µm wide. The cap tissue comprises interwoven, inflated hyphae with widths between 2 and 25µm. Neither the gill tissue nor the cap tissue show any color reaction when stained with Melzer's reagent. <b>Clamp</b> <b>connections</b> are rare in the hyphae of Lepiota babruzalka.|$|E
5|$|The spores are elliptical, {{wrinkled}} {{or slightly}} warted, and 10–14 by 5–7.5μm. They are nonamyloid, meaning {{they have a}} negative color reaction with the iodine in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing structures, the basidia, are elongated or club-shaped, hyaline (glassy or translucent), and four-spored, with dimensions of 60–90 by 8.5–11.5μm. G.clavatus does not contain cystidia, the sterile cells associated with basidia in many species. <b>Clamp</b> <b>connections</b> are present.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{spindle-shaped}} or elliptical, thick-walled, smooth, {{and have}} dimensions of 13–16 by 5.5–6.5μm. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are club-shaped (clavate), attached to 1 to 4 spores, and have dimensions of 35–90 by 9–12μm. The cystidia (sterile, non-spore-bearing cells found interspersed among the basidia) in the hymenium have dimensions of 33–60 by 8–12μm. <b>Clamp</b> <b>connections</b> are absent in the hyphae of B.pulcherrimus.|$|E
40|$|Rhizoctonia sp. causes leaf blight on Toona sureni. This {{pathogen}} has {{characteristics such}} as right-angles hyphal branching pattern, the presence of septa, the absence of <b>clamp</b> <b>connection,</b> produced no conidia nor spores, and formed sclerotia. The disease symptom is necrotic type with brownish lesions which develop fast on the leaf. Being covered by the lesions, the leaf will be completely brown, macerated and then become wilt, dry and fall. The dispersal of the disease is mediated by the touching of the infectious leaves with the healthy ones. The experiment showed that Rhizoctonia inoculation on leaf, with or without wound, caused the seedling diseased. Key words: Toona sureni, blight, Rhizoctonia sp., characteristics, symptom</p...|$|R
50|$|The mycelium, which {{grows in}} the host tree, is heterothallic and tetrapolar. Lenzites warnieri has a trimitic trama, meaning a tissue {{comprising}} generative hyphae, binding hyphae, and skeletal hyphae. While the generative hyphae are responsible for growth, the hardened skeletal hyphae and the thick-walled binding hyphae maintain {{the stability of the}} fruit body and provide its corky consistency. The generative hyphae are thin-walled, hyaline, measure 2-3 µm in diameter and have a <b>clamp</b> <b>connection.</b> The binding hyphae are tough, spiral and heavily branched. They are 3-5 µm in diameter and pass over to the skeletal hyphae in the same size. They protrude distinctly into the fruit tissue, a characteristic that differentiates them from the sympatric L. betulinus.|$|R
40|$|Shape-memory-materials show good {{actuating}} properties {{based on}} their high reversible strain potential. The implicit positioning range can profitably be used in micro machines, if detachable connections between shape-memory-elements and adjacent steel-components are sufficiently realized. In this paper theoretical approaches to describe the design principles of the shaft to collar connections are followed by experimental validation of <b>clamping</b> and pressfit <b>connections.</b> The variation of the preload for <b>clamping</b> <b>connections</b> can be predicted if the temperature-dependent elasticity of the shape-memory element is known. The experimental results for longitudinal pressfit connections match the extended theoretical elastic plastic model. The load transfer is characterized by considerable slip between shaft and collar even if small loads are applied. This results in huge hysteresis for cyclic loading. The evaluation of the surface appearance confirms the necessity of the calculated large joint length. Dependent on the temperature and the micro structure of the shape-memory-component different wear mechanisms are of major importance. (orig.)

5|$|The {{thick-walled}} spores {{are roughly}} spherical, rusty-brown, finely and densely warted, and have diameters of 5–6.5µm. Elaters are 50–80 by 4–6µm, and have ring-like or spiral thickenings. The endoperidium consists of densely interwoven hyphae that are 3–9µm {{in diameter and}} walls less than 1µm thick; they are septate, branched, pale yellow, with <b>clamp</b> <b>connections.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{two other}} {{luminescent}} species of Mycena section Exornatae {{are similar in}} appearance to M.chlorophos. M.discobasis fruit bodies have paler caps; microscopically, they have larger spores measuring 9.9 by 6.7μm, and lack the short apical appendage found on M.chlorophos cheilocystidia. M.margarita has smaller spores averaging 6.9 by 4.4μm, smaller cheilocystidia, and loop-like <b>clamp</b> <b>connections.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amanita nothofagi {{mushrooms}} can {{be confused}} with A.australis if the warts have been washed off and the colour has been bleached. A reliable method to distinguish the two is to check {{for the presence of}} <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> at the bases of the basidia, which are present in A.australis and absent from A.nothofagi. Ridley notes that the type collection was made with a dark grey specimen, and later collectors who found browner specimens have had difficulty in correctly identifying the species. Paler specimens resemble A.excelsa, which led some to incorrectly believe that the species occurs in New Zealand. Amanita luteofusca is also similar in appearance, spore size, amyloid reaction, and lack of <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> in the basidia. It is distinguished from A.nothofagi largely on the basis of colour—it is a greyish-brown to yellowish-grey brown that fades to pinkish-buff as it gets older. Tulloss suggests that the resemblance of a number of species from Australasia and Chile which lack brightly coloured fruit bodies and share similar greyish to brownish rings and volvas may indicate that they share Gondwanan ancestors.|$|E
500|$|The basidia of G.quadrifidum have a basal <b>clamp</b> <b>connection,</b> or they narrow into a hyphal {{part that}} ends at a clamp. When they are young, {{they are more}} or less [...] to club-shaped, but in age they often become more or less bottle-shaped, [...] or {{sometimes}} almost , among other shapes; when mature they measure 14–21 x 4.5–7µm (excluding the hyphal part). The hyphal part is less than 1–6 x 1–2µm. The [...] (thin projections of the basidia that attach to the spore) are 4–6µm long and mostly 1–1.5µm thick. The hyphae located immediately underneath the basidia are thin-walled, 1–2µm wide, provided with clamps and densely branched. The hyphae of the tramal plates are roughly parallel, thin-walled, 1–2µm wide, and provided with clamps which may be dilated.|$|R

5|$|Cyathus olla has -shaped spores with {{dimensions}} of 10–146–8µm. In 1927, George Willard Martin examined the microscopic features of {{various members of}} the Nidulariaceae family, including Cyathus olla. He noted that in this species, the basidia—spore-bearing cells—are club-shaped or cylindrical and have long stems, and they sometimes have a <b>clamp</b> <b>connection</b> at the basal end of the structure. Basidia typically hold between two and four sessile spores that are directly attached to the basidium, rather than via a sterigma. Revealed only after the spore is separated, a temporary apiculus marks the point of attachment. The spores are generally separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize; this basidial breakdown typically occurs simultaneously with a gelatinization of cells lining the inside wall of the peridiole. After separating from the basidia the outer wall of the spores may thicken, although they generally do not increase in size.|$|R
5|$|Collected in deposit, {{the spores}} of B. mirabilis are olive-brown. Viewed with a microscope, the spores are {{spindle-shaped}} to roughly elliptical, with smooth, thick walls, and have dimensions of 18–22 by 7–9µm. Overholts' 1940 publication on the species reported spore dimensions of 20–26 by 8–9µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), 4-spored, and have dimensions of 31–36 by 7–11µm. Cystidia (sterile cells {{on the face}} of a gill) are thin-walled, and measure 60–90 by 10–18µm. There are no <b>clamp</b> <b>connections</b> present in the hyphae.|$|E

The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–35 by 7–9µm. Cystidia are present {{on both the}} tube walls (as pleurocystidia) and abundantly on the edges (as cheilocystidia). They are somewhat spindle-shaped, sometimes with a central swelling, and measure 45–70 by 7–12μm. <b>Clamp</b> <b>connections</b> are absent from the hyphae, {{and all of the}} hyphae are inamyloid.|$|E
5|$|Gasteroid {{fruit body}} types are either roughly spherical or tuberous, {{occasionally}} with stipes, and {{usually have a}} peridium that is either simple or multi-layered. Mature gasteroid fruit bodies generally open irregularly at maturity to expose a powdery gleba with a color ranging from white to yellow or black-brown to black. Capillitia are generally absent from the gleba. Spores are spherical or nearly so, and have a surface texture that ranges from smooth to wart-like and spiny, or sometimes with reticulations.

30|$|There is a {{possibility}} that the decreased ability of transformants to decompose wood was caused by protoplast generation. Many basidiomycete fungi exist as dikaryons in which the two genomes exist in separated nuclei. In previous studies, it has been indicated that the nuclei number was changed during the preparation of protoplasts from dikaryotic mycelia of basidiomycetes (Ohmasa et al. 1987). It has also been reported that the characteristics of progenitor basidiomycetes became altered by protoplast isolation, including growth rate changes (Clark and Anderson 2004). In our study, there was some variation in the sizes of protoplasts prepared from MG- 60, and the number of nuclei stained by propidium iodide also varied among the protoplasts (data not shown). It might occur possible that the change in the number of nuclei by protoplast isolation transmuted the original characteristics of MG- 60 with regards to delignification; however, it was unclear whether protoplasts of MG- 60 were haploid or diploid because the <b>clamp</b> <b>connection</b> was not observed in MG- 60.|$|R
40|$|A Total FETI (TFETI) based domain {{decomposition}} algorithm with preconditioning by a natural coarse grid of rigid body motions {{is adapted to}} the solution of two-dimensional multibody contact problems of elasticity with the Coulomb friction and proved to be scalable for the Tresca friction.
