40|$|Abstract. Intrathecal {{implants}} of adrenal medullary <b>chromaffin</b> <b>cells</b> relieve {{chronic pain}} by secreting catecholamines, opioids and other neuroactive substances. Recently, macrocapsules with hollow fibers {{were employed to}} isolate immunologically xenogeneic <b>chromaffin</b> <b>cells,</b> but the poor viability in vivo of the encapsulated <b>chromaffin</b> <b>cells</b> limited the usefulness of this method. In this study, we used microencapsulation technology to increase the viability of <b>chromaffin</b> <b>cells.</b> Bovine adrenal <b>chromaffin</b> <b>cells</b> were microencapsulated with alginate and poly-L-lysine and implanted intrathecally in a rat using the neuropathic pain model. Intrathecal implants of microencapsulated cells relieved cold allodynia, {{which is the most}} prominent symptom of the neuropathic pain model in a rat. Furthermore, the microencapsulated <b>chromaffin</b> <b>cells</b> were morphologically normal and retained their functionality.

[...] These qualities provide advantage even though they have smaller vesicles and quantal size, holding only an average of 1.9x10−19 moles of neurotransmitter released. [...] The vesicles hold catecholamines, mostly dopamine but also limited amount of norepinephrine, and release of these neurotransmitters give rise to spikes due to changes in current similar to chromaffin cells.|$|E

50|$|More recently, the {{technique}} {{has been used}} to study exocytosis in chromaffin cells. When imaged using DIC, chromaffin cells appear as round cells with small protrusions. When the same cell is imaged using IRM, the footprint of the cell on the glass can be clearly seen as a dark area with small protrusions (see Figure 2 in the gallery below). When vesicles fuse with the membrane, they appear as small light circles within the dark footprint (Figure 2, bright spots in the top cell in the right panel). An example of vesicle fusion in chromaffin cells using IRM is shown in movie 1. Upon stimulation with 60 mM potassium, multiple bright spots begin to appear inside the dark footprint of the <b>chromaffin</b> <b>cell</b> as a result of exocytosis of dense core granules. Because IRM doesn't require a fluorescent label, it can be combined with other imaging techniques, such as epifluorescence and TIRF microscopy to study protein dynamics together with vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis. Another benefit of the lack of fluorescent labels is reduced phototoxicity.|$|E

The effects of such implants were evaluated on the pain behavior resulting from a chronic constrictive injury (CCI) of the rat sciatic nerve. Sprague-Dawley rats with a unilateral lesion were implanted in the lumbar subarachnoid space and tested for mechanical/thermal allodynia and hyperalgesia.

40|$|In view of calmodulin's {{widespread}} role in calcium-regulated processes, {{together with}} the requirement of Ca(' 2 +) for <b>chromaffin</b> <b>cell</b> secretion, a possible role for calmodulin in translating the Ca(' 2 +) signal for secretion is suggested. Isolated bovine adrenal medullary cells were maintained in monolayer culture and their morphological and functional characteristics examined. The cultured <b>chromaffin</b> <b>cell</b> was found capable of accumulating exogenous amines via a high affinity uptake(, 1) -like process which closely simulated the neuronal process in many respects but demonstrated neither stereo- nor structural selectivity. The accumulated amines appeared to be uniformly distributed within the <b>chromaffin</b> <b>cell</b> as they were released in parallel with and in equal proportion to the endogenous <b>chromaffin</b> <b>cell</b> catecholamines. This finding proved invaluable in designing a rapid reproducible method for assaying for catecholamine release from the chromaffin cells in culture. Catecholamine secretion from the chromaffin cells in response to stimulation with either acetylcholine or a depolarizing concentration of K('+) is a Ca(' 2 +) -dependent event. The stimulation-induced amine release was reduced {{in the presence of}} trifluoperazine, an antipsychotic agent and potent calmodulin antagonist. However, trifluoperazine blocked catecholamine release from the cultured chromaffin cells at a step distal from Ca(' 2 +) entry, thus providing indirect evidence for a role for calmodulin in the secretory process. More direct evidence for a role for calmodulin in the process of secretion was provided with the use of antibodies raised against calmodulin. In this regard, erythrocyte ghost-mediated microinjection of calmodulin antibodies into viable cell cultures inhibited stimulus-evoked catecholamine secretion from the cultured cells without affecting amine accumulation into these cells. These findings support the hypothesis that calmodulin is important in translating the calcium signal for <b>chromaffin</b> <b>cell</b> secretion.

40|$|Synaptotagmin- 1, the {{canonical}} isoform of the synaptotagmin family, is a Ca 2 + sensor for fast synchronous neurotransmitter release in forebrain neurons and <b>chromaffin</b> <b>cells.</b> Even though deletion of synaptotagmin- 1 abolishes fast exocytosis in <b>chromaffin</b> <b>cells,</b> it reduces overall secretion by only 20 % {{because of the}} persistence of slow exocytosis.

Here, we examined Ca 2 +-triggered exocytosis in <b>chromaffin</b> <b>cells</b> from KO mice lacking synaptotagmin- 7, and from knockin mice containing normal levels of a mutant synaptotagmin- 7 whose C 2 B domain does not bind Ca 2 +.
