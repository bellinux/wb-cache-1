50|$|The Lines saw action {{during the}} Thirteenth Siege of Gibraltar (1726-27), when they mounted two cannon and several swivel guns which were {{reported}} to have caused heavy casualties among the attacking Spanish force. During the Anglo-Spanish War of 1761-63, they mounted two 9-pdrs and five 6-pdrs, and by 1770 they could accommodate up to fifty wall-mounted guns using sockets cut into the eastern end of the parapet's crest. A <b>communication</b> <b>gallery</b> was cut in 1790. The Lines were bombarded again during the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779-83). On 11 June 1782, a Spanish shell exploded inside the magazine of Princess Anne's Battery further up the Rock, causing a massive explosion that blew the flank of the battery into the Prince's Lines, killing fourteen soldiers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1704, an Anglo-Dutch force {{captured}} Gibraltar in {{the name}} of Charles, Archduke of Austria who claimed the crown of Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession. The Lines were named after him. They saw use during the Twelfth Siege of Gibraltar (1704-5), when the Spanish and their French allies succeeded in breaching the defences but were repelled; during the Thirteenth Siege (1727), when they were bombarded by the Spanish; and during the Great Siege (1779-83), when they were again under Spanish bombardment. During the tenure of William Green as Gibraltar's Senior Engineer from 1761-83, the Lines were repaired, improved and fortified, and the cliffs below were scarped to make them impossible to climb. Facing west towards the Bay of Gibraltar, they were intended to make it possible to enfilade any attacking force trying to reach the gates of Gibraltar; they are connected to the Queen's Lines via a <b>communication</b> <b>gallery</b> completed on 13 September 1782.|$|E
2500|$|Located on {{a height}} to the {{southwest}} of Rimplas, the position was originally called Ouvrage de la Madeleine. While it was a prototype for later work, it is not entirely typical of Maginot fortifications, with large expanses of wall armored with 20cm steel plate and other sections overlaid with stone masonry. The construction encountered problems with soil consistency and water infiltration. The underground portion of the ouvrage, containing the ammunition magazines, living quarters, command spaces, generating plant and <b>communication</b> <b>galleries</b> between the combat blocks covers three levels.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} area of DesignArt aiming to {{research}} how design knowledge, design process and coherence with the brief are perceived and valued by the involved parties. We followed the work and <b>communication</b> between Dutch <b>gallery</b> Droog and designer Freddie Yauner, gathering data from the designer, the client and our neutral perspective, using interviews and questionnaires. In the interaction designer-client, each of the parties had different access to information and diverse insights into the project. Our results suggest that intuition based decision-making and factual knowledge is valued differently by each of the parties with a different emphasis on "the outcome". Consequently client and designer understand "the process" as a sum of creative thinking represented by the outcome itself...|$|R
5000|$|The Gorgona Group (named {{after the}} mythological {{creature}} of Gorgon), was a Croatian avant-garde art group {{which consisted of}} artists and art historians: Dimitrije Bašičević-Mangelos, Miljenko Horvat, Marijan Jevšovar, Julije Knifer, Ivan Kožarić, Matko Meštrović, Radoslav Putar, Đuro Seder, , operated {{along the lines of}} anti-art in Zagreb between 1959 and 1966. Beside individual works linked to traditional techniques, the members proposed different concepts and forms of artistic <b>communication,</b> ran a <b>gallery</b> and published the [...] "anti-magazine" [...] Gorgona. In each issue they featured one artist's work such as Dieter Roth or Julije Knifer. Works by the Gorgona Group are widely represented in a number of institutions in Croatia including, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb, the Filip Trade Collection and the Sudac Collection. Several years later, the group was disbanded, some of the members forming the Group of Six Artists.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{important}} things in teaching English in Indonesia is how to give a big chance to the students to improve their communication skills. Communication skills which include oral and written expression are very important because they are parts of the soft skills which give a big contribution in determining someone’s success in career and daily life. Gallery Walk as one of collaborative learning models promotes chances for students to practice their <b>communication</b> skills. <b>Gallery</b> Walk gets students out of their chairs and actively involves them in synthesizing important concepts, in consensus building, in writing, and in public speaking. In Gallery Walk, teams rotate around the classroom, composing answers to questions as well as reflecting upon the answers given by other groups. Questions are posted on charts or just pieces of paper located {{in different parts of}} the classroom. Each chart or "station" has its own question that relates to an important class concept. The technique closes with an oral presentation or "report out" in which each group synthesizes comments to a particular question. Gallery Walk dedicates time for students to practice discussing, debating, organizing, and writing the language of the topic. Besides, it connects learners to both new and old information. Through Gallery Walk students may improve their oral communication skills such as personal communication, presentation, and group discussion. They may also develop their written communication when they write the report of the activity. Key Words: communications skills, <b>gallery</b> walk, oral <b>communication,</b> written communication. ...|$|R
40|$|The Internet plays a {{significant}} role in attracting visitors and facilitating their trip planning and reservations. Therefore, it is essential for city tourism websites to evaluate and improve website performance in order to keep and increase their online presence and competitiveness in the marketplace. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the official websites of City Culture and Tourism Directorates (CCTD) in Turkey based on the facilities and services offered by the websites. In order to examine the content and function of these websites, content analysis is used and a structured around 40 checkpoints. In total of 79 CCTDs websites were analyzed. The survey revealed that websites are generally informative but lacked interactive facilities. Most city tourism websites do not currently maximize the capability of the internet in destination marketing. While the most frequently features in websites are culture/history information, links to main page, <b>communication</b> information, image <b>gallery,</b> video, links to other sites, search capabilities and index page. The results also show that CCTDs are not utilizing the Internet to its full potential to effectively market their destinations. It is recommended that these organizations evolve their websites into marketing tools to capitalise on the potential internet market...|$|R

40|$|This output forms {{part of a}} {{collaborative}} research project 'Flight: Drawing Interpretations between the University of the Arts London and the National Gallery (NG), London'. Bugg conceived, designed and choreographed a live costume dance performance and the screening of the film. The work is experimental in extending design methods for contemporary dance through theoretical and empirical research into the relationship between design, drawing methodologies and cognitive theory to develop garments and choreography as simultaneous practice. Costume design is usually applied to choreography, in this case they were developed simultaneously through improvisational sessions between designer and dancer, analysis of video footage and recorded testimony. The methodology for performance approached the body as a physical drawing and design tool, with the researcher and dancer in continuous verbal and experiential dialogue {{as a means of}} generating performative clothing design and <b>communication.</b> The National <b>Gallery</b> painting ‘The Tempest’ by Peder Balke, inspired both the clothing, and dance development through which the methodology was tested. The methodology is informed by practitioners extending methods in design for dance, such as Maria Blaisse, Rei Kawakubo and choreographers such as Wayne McGregor who works with cognitive and interdisciplinary approaches to develop dance. A related research paper was presented at RMIT Melbourne in 2013, for the conference ‘Drawing Out’. The film was also screened later at Berlin Fashion Film Festival 2013. The research approach was developed through a peer reviewed paper and published e-book ‘Embodied Design and Communication: Drawing with the Body and Cloth’ through the interdisciplinary. net 3 rd Global conference, Salzburg, Austria, November 2012, and is currently being developed into a book chapter...|$|R
