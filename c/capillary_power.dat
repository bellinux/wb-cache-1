The setup under study consists of <b>capillary</b> <b>powered</b> electrode through which helium gas flows and a grounded ring electrode placed a distance of few mm {{in front of the}} capillary. The discharge is excited by sinusoidal voltage with amplitude of 2 kV and 30 KHz repetition rate.

This includes radicals (OH, NO, O,), ions and electrons, UV radiation, electrical fields. PLASIMO modelling toolkit is used to simulate the capillary plasma-jet in order to quantify the delivery of fluxes and fields to the treated tissue.

This article uses Central Park to illustrate how a combination of their insights helps to elucidate the emergence of pedagogical spaces and environmental hegemonies. I first propose a conceptual framework drawing on diverse parallels and tensions in Gramsci’s Quaderni del carcere and Foucault’s investigations in the 1970 s, reassessed here {{from the vantage point}} of the implicit debate with Marxism in La société punitive. Urbanization and the built environment are theorized as material apparatuses of a form of <b>capillary</b> <b>power</b> that reconfigures the relations between state, civil society and individual subjects, striving to forge common senses of space that buttress political hegemony. This analytical toolkit is then applied in a political reappraisal of Central Park, exploring the role of design in the pedagogy of subaltern spatialities and the normalization of a consensual regime of publicity. The discussion pays special attention to the park’s assemblage of liberal and disciplinary spatial techniques, its connection to broader agencies beyond core state apparatuses, and their effect on the advent of an integral state formation...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThis study {{examines}} {{the struggle of}} residents of four slums {{in the heart of}} the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, to remain in the city in the face of commercial redevelopment pressures during the first decade of the 21 st century.; In 2003, following a decade of forced evictions of the poor from the city center, the Royal Government of Cambodia broke with the past and authorized the redevelopment of the four city center slums as pilots for a major slum upgrading campaign, through the technique of land sharing.; The study assesses the extent to which the redevelopment projects succeeded in providing slum dwellers with the basic legal rights promised to them as part of upgrading, which can be regarded as residents’ core citizenship contract with the state—a “citizenship of status”. Second, the {{study examines}} the extent to which slum residents were involved in shaping the redevelopment plans, which can be regarded as a reflection of their “power” and agency—a “citizenship of practice”. The assessment of “citizenship of practice” is based on two theoretical approaches. The first is guided by the propositions of <b>capillary</b> <b>power</b> by Michel Foucault (1978 et al.), for whom power is diffuse and omnipresent, with all actors in the role of subjects as well as agents. The second expands on the typology of options of exit, voice and loyalty developed by the economist Albert Hirschman (1970), and later refined by the political scientists William Lyons and David Lowery (1986 and 1989).; The study concludes that the slum dwellers’ “battle for living space” took the form of an elaborate charade. Commercial developers, with the backing of the Municipality and local authorities, dressed up their slum redevelopment projects with an appearance of inevitability to convince residents that they had the legal right and technical ability to develop the settlements as they saw fit. In response, residents presented an appearance of compliance, even as—below the surface—they were engaged in manifold resistance tactics, not necessarily to oppose the projects, but at least to take from them what little they could for themselves...|$|E
40|$|People create {{profiles}} {{on social}} network sites and Twitter accounts {{against the background}} of an audience. This paper argues that closely examining content created by others and looking at one’s own content through other people’s eyes, a common part of social media use, should be framed as social surveillance. While social surveillance is distinguished from traditional surveillance along three axes (power, hierarchy, and reciprocity), its effects and behavior modification is common to traditional surveillance. Drawing on ethnographic studies of United States populations, I look at social surveillance, how it is practiced, and its impact on people who engage in it. I use Foucault’s concept of <b>capillaries</b> of <b>power</b> to demonstrate that social surveillance assumes the power differentials evident in everyday interactions rather than the hierarchical power relationships assumed in much of the surveillance literature. Social media involves a collapse of social contexts and social roles, complicating boundary work but facilitating social surveillance. Individuals strategically reveal, disclose and conceal personal information to create connections with others and tend social boundaries. These processes are normal parts of day-to-day life in communities that are highly connected through social media...|$|R

Over the past several years, the use of passive cooling devices in electronics such as heat pipes and vapor chambers has increased. Due to their more widespread use, these technologies have a high demand for more adaptable manufacturing and increased efficiency. The choice in wicking structure in these devices has been limited to trading efficiency for manufacturability or vice versa. Using an electroforming process, a new wicking structure has been designed which can optimize the balance between these two extremes. This new process forms a wick which can be grown on virtually any metal surface and on almost any geometry. In addition, the effective thermal conductivity, <b>capillary</b> pumping <b>power,</b> and permeability of this wick can be controlled during its manufacture by varying the electroforming process's parameters. By changing the acidity, salt content, and current density of the electroforming bath, a wick can be generated to meet the requirement of high heat flux applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{capillary}} rheometer {{was designed and}} constructed to carry out studies on the flow behaviour of viscous non-Newtonian fluids. Two capillary tubes were attached to the pressure chamber which increase {{the accuracy of the}} rheological measurements (power law index as well as consistency index). By employing two <b>capillary</b> tubes, the <b>power</b> law index can be calculated directly from the measuring values and the accuracy of consistency index increases as well. Capillary tubes with different diameters and various lengths can be used and a wide range of shear rates can be covered by using different tubes. Tests were conducted with solutions of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) of different concentrations and various temperatures. The CMC solutions exhibited characteristics typical of power law model of non-Newtonian fluids. The measurements illustrated that the consistency index varies significantly with both concentration and temperature. Increasing concentration enhances consistency index while promoting temperature has a reverse effect. Also concentration has noticeable effect on power law Index. As concentration increases the power law index decreases. The effect of temperature on power law index is negligible...|$|R
40|$|Due to its {{potential}} for exquisite mass detection limits and resolving <b>power,</b> <b>capillary</b> electrophoresis is used for biochemical measurements on single cells; however, accurate measurements of many physiological parameters require sampling strategies that are considerably faster than those presently available. We have developed a laser-based technique to lyse single, adherent, mammalian cells on millisecond time scales. The cellular contents are then introduced into a capillary where electrophoretic separation and detection are performed. Improved temporal resolution of biological measurements results from the extremely rapid lysis made possible by this method. Additionally, the cell is not perturbed by mechanical or electrical stresses prior to sampling. Such disturbances can alter cellular physiology, resulting in inaccurate measurements. The fast cell lysis, the absence of cellular stresses prior to lysis, and the application to adherent mammalian cells are significant refinements to CE-based measurements on single cells. With this laser-micropipet combination, {{it will be possible}} to measure the intracellular concentration of molecules that change on subsecond to second time scales, for example, substrates of many cellular enzymes. © 1998 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince the {{pioneering}} works of Taylor and Bretherton, the thickness h {{of the film}} deposited behind a long bubble invading a Newtonian fluid is known to increase with the <b>Capillary</b> number <b>power</b> 2 / 3 (h ∼ RCa 2 / 3), where R is the radius of the circular tube and the Capillary number, Ca, comparing the viscous and capillary effects. This law, known as Bretherton law, is only valid {{in the limit of}} Ca < 0, 01 and negligible inertia and gravity. We revisit this classical problem when the fluid is a Yield-Stress Fluid (YSF) exhibiting both a yield stress and a shear-thinning behaviour. First, we provide quantitative measurement of the thickness of the deposited layer for Carbopol Herschel-Bulkley fluid in the limit where the yield-stress is of similar order of magnitude as the capillary pressure and for 0. 1 < Ca < 1. To understand our observation, we use scaling arguments to extend the analytical expression of Bretherton's law to YSF in circular tubes. In the limit of Ca < 0, 1, our scaling law, in which the adjustable parameters are set using previous results concerning non-Newtonian fluid, successfully retrieves several features of the literature. First, it shows that (i) the thickness deposited behind a Bingham YSF (exhibiting a yield stress only) is larger than for a Newtonian fluid and (ii) the deposited layer increases with the amplitude of the yield stress. This is in quantitative agreement with previous numerical results concerning Bingham fluid. It also agrees with results concerning pure shear-thinning fluids in the absence of yield stress : the shear-thinning behaviour of the fluid reduces the deposited thickness as previously observed. Last, in the limit of vanishing velocity, our scaling law predicts that the thickness of deposited YSF converges towards a finite value, which presumably depends on the microstructure of the YSF, in agreement with previous research on the topic performed in different geometries. For 0. 1 < Ca < 1,the scaling law fails to describe the data. In this limit, non-linear effects must be taken into account...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Techa {{river was}} {{contaminated}} in 1949 - 1956 from the nuclear enterprise "MAYAK". The investigations {{were carried out}} in flood plain of the Techa river in 1992 - 1999. In the upper and middle parts of the river the basic contaminator is I 3 7 Cs; downstream- more active is 9 0 Sr. Density of contamination of soils with 9 0 Sr down the river changes from 600 to 200 kBq/m 2, and that with 1 3 7 Cs- from 2, 000 to 80 kBq/m 2. Radionuclides content in soils of {{the central part of}} the flood plain (30 - 40 m from the river-bed) also decreases further from the discharge point 1 - 2 orders. The Techa flood plain may be considered to be a source of secondary radioactive contamination of the water ecosystem. We evaluated the absorption stability and water migration of radionuclides in its soils under experimental conditions. The main quantity of 9 0 Sr was in exchangeable (41 - 66 %) form. ! 3 7 Cs was in firmly fixed form (80 - 98 %). The study of radionuclides distribution in the liquid fraction of the soil showed that the main part of 9 0 Sr (84 %) was found in gravitation moisture. 1 3 7 Cs (97 %) was in a less mobile form of moisture which was connected with soil by <b>capillary</b> and sorption <b>powers.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Active {{remedial}} {{activities have}} been ongoing since 1996 to address {{low levels of}} solvent contamination at the Miscellaneous Chemical Basin at SRS. Contaminant levels in the subsurface may be approaching levels where mass transfer limitations are impacting {{the efficiency of the}} remedial action. Rate limited mass transfer effects have been observed at other sites in the vadose zone at the SRS, however, detailed measurements and evaluation has not been undertaken. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the mass transfer rates are very slow from the fine grain sediments. This conclusion is based on the observation that measured soil gas concentrations tend to be low in permeable zones relative to the higher concentrations found in fine grain zones. Decreasing soil gas concentration with depth below the ''upland unit'' at several areas at SRS is also evidence of slow diffusion rates. In addition, due to the length of time since disposal ceased at the MCB, we hypothesize that mobile solvents have migrated downward, and the solvent remaining in the upper fine grain zone (''upland unit'') are trapped in fine grain material and are primarily released by gas diffusion (Riha and Rossabi 2004). Natural weathering and other chemical solutions disposed with the solvents can further enhance this effect by increasing the micro-porosity in the clays (kaolinite). This microporosity can result in increased entrapment of water and solvents by <b>capillary</b> forces (<b>Powers,</b> et. al., 2003). Also supporting this conclusion is the observation that active SVE has proven ineffective on VOC removal from the fine grain zones at the SRS. Adsorption and the very slow release phenomenon have been documented similarly in the literature especially for old solvent spills such as at the SRS (Pavlostathis and Mathavan 1992; Oostrom and Lenhard 2003). Mass transfer relationships need to be developed in order to optimize remediation activities and to determine actual loading rates to groundwater. These metrics will aid in answering the question ''How clean is protective of the environment''? For this study, a field test was developed to measure a mass transfer factor by injecting clean air into the subsurface through a sample port or well and measuring the rebound VOC concentration over time. Interpretation of the he results of these tests will provide a mass transfer rate that will be used to determine the appropriate type of SVE for the area (passive, enhanced or active SVE), a measured field parameter to estimate mass loading to the groundwater, and time frame for cleanup...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} heat {{dissipation}} in electrophoresis had been solved by using capillaries. Unprecedented {{high number of}} theoretical plates, more than one million, had been achieved on these narrow bore capillaries. Unfortunately, this high efficiency was not achievable for the separation of biological samples using bare fused silica capillaries. Severe adsorption of proteins caused tailing and distortion of peaks. Coating the internal surface of the silica capillary with an epoxy based neutral coating was effective in eliminating protein adsorption. The separation of model proteins using coated <b>capillaries</b> demonstrated the <b>power</b> of the CE technique in protein separations. ^ Despite the high resolving power of CE, biochemists prefer slab gel electrophoresis, though labor intensive and low resolution, over the CE technique for the separation of proteins, nucleotides, and carbohydrates. Part {{of the reason is}} that CE can not provide biochemists the flexibility and convenience of carrying out various reactions within a homogeneous media. The purpose of this research was to develop new methods using a CE system to carry out reactions usually seen only with slab gel electrophoresis. The characteristics of mixing, as well as separation, in the CE technique were studied, and a new strategy was proposed to assay various reagents, such as enzymes and substrates. The method includes the injection of sample, the separation of an enzyme from other species in the running buffer, stop flow reaction, separation of the product from the enzyme, and transport of the product to the detector. ^ The enzymes assayed in this research include glucose- 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G- 6 -PDH), acid phosphatase (AcP), leucyl aminopeptidase (LAP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). ...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedPulsed power {{technology}} {{is one of}} the tools that is used by scientists and engineers nowadays to produce gas plasmas. The transient ultra high power is able to provide a huge pulse of energy which is sometimes greater than the ionization energy of the gas, and therefore separates the ions and electrons to form the plasma.; Sometimes, the pulsed power components themselves are plasma devices. For example, the gas type switches can "turn on" the circuit by creating the plasma channel between the switch electrodes. Mini Back Lighted Thyratron, or as we call it, mini-BLT, {{is one of the}}se gas type plasma switches. The development of the reduced size and weight "mini-BLT" is presented in this dissertation. Based on the operation characteristics testing of the mini-BLT, suggestions of optimizing the design of the switch are proposed. All the factors such as the geometry of the hollow electrodes and switch housing, the gas condition, the optical triggering source, etc. are necessary to consider when we design and operate the mini-BLT.; By reducing the diameter of the cylindrical gas path between the electrodes in the BLT, a novel high density plasma source is developed, producing the plasma in the "squeezed" <b>capillary.</b> The pulsed <b>power</b> generator, of course, is inevitably used to provide the ionization energy for hydrogen gas sealed in the capillary. Plasma diagnostics are necessarily analyzed and presented in detail to properly complete and understand the capillary plasma. This high density plasma source (10 ^ 19 /cm^ 3) has the potential applications in the plasma wakefield accelerator. The resonant oscillation behavior of the particles in plasmas allows for dynamically generated accelerating electric fields that have orders of magnitude larger than those available in the conventional RF accelerators.; Finally, the solid state switches are introduced as a comparison to the gas type switch. Pulsed power circuit topologies such as the Marx Bank, magnetic pulse compression and diode opening are used to accomplish the pulse generator design. Their applications for the transient plasma car engine combustion and bio-medical skin cancer cell treatments are also introduced...|$|R
40|$|Capitalism goes green, {{not just}} for appearance, but by calculation. This {{dissertation}} explores if and how the greening of capitalism has altered in any way {{the basic structure of}} capitalism and how far capitalism can even legitimately be connected to greenism. ^ Green capitalism is explored through two perspectives—a Foucaultian critique on the problematization of the ecological crisis and a Marxist analysis on the modus operandi of green capitalism. On the one hand, this dissertation examines the inextricable elements of social power, knowledge, and values, in identifying what we call “the ecological crisis. ” It highlights the disciplinary mechanism capitalism exercises on green movements, the <b>capillary</b> mode of <b>power</b> that defines ecological degradation exclusively in terms of capitalist discourses. On the other hand, this dissertation explicates green capitalism as constructed in a specific process following the straining nexus of capital-nature-labor which replaces the traditional antinomy between capital and labor. It studies {{the extent to which the}} greening of capitalism gratifies capitalist imperatives that demand the radical extension of privatization into previously unclaimed spheres of nature. In short, this study addresses the question, “whither capitalism, faced with ecological limits?” ^ The capitalist accommodation of greenism proves, paradoxically, the imminent catastrophe of capitalism. This dissertation clarifies how greenism remains in complicity with the sustainability of capital against nature, not of man in nature. Environmentalism prods capitalism to a reflective recognition of its own limits, while ecologism dilutes everyday struggles in the fantasies of back-to-nature claims. The illusion that capitalism can be either enlightened or ignored constitutes a familiar formula of reformism: the voluntary future for a given past. This dissertation contends that the advance of greenism itself mirrors the capitalist response to ecological challenges; that green capitalism, far from solving the nature question, is a recipe for its aggravation; and that capitalism paves the way for its death knell by greening itself. The dissertation envisions the green society—ecologically viable, socially just, and politically feasible—through the displacement of capitalism, not through a greenism that either attempts to sublimate the indomitable practices of capitalism, or applies a green cosmetic onto the addictive system. ...|$|R

Outside of the prescriptive and diagnostic temporalities that are usual to politics, this locale paces un-thinking intimate attachments to colonial orders. Here, "un-thinking" hosts a double valence. As an adjective, it describes those attachments as unconscious directives of hegemony in everyday movements. As a verb, it acts on those attachments in material things that are inclusive, and in excess, of thought. Things like inheriting a family name, "everyday life," and feelings have political and economic rhythms that suffuse relationships to the colonial state (government, U. S. militaries, juridical institutions) and society (plantation owning elites, the health sector, academia, and the faith community). The decolonial archive is a theoretical apparatus for approaching structures that alternately invest Asian settlers in an American-Hawaii, tense against U. S. hegemony, and recuperate those tensions into attachments to America. To access the micrological textured of colonization, I've looked to the intimate paper-trails that my own family-names generate into one of Hawai'i's defining colonial institutions, the Territorial-era (1900 - 1959) plantation. These plantation communities were crucial arenas of the labor organizing, wartime economic expansion, patriotism and consumer socialization {{that contributed to the}} emergence of a new multiracial local ruling class in a post-Statehood epoch (1959). Their political and economic enfranchisement, gauged in increased property ownership, professional employment and public office-holding, has been adorned with liberatory signs of racial justice. But this format assumes only political-economic investments secure Asian settler allegiance to Hawai'i's U. S. occupation. To stop the translation of this history (acceleration of multiculturalism under globalization) into that evidence (proofs of American capitalism's capacity to incorporate difference), I archive Asian settlers colonialism in new <b>capillary</b> forms of <b>power</b> that target affect, feeling, sensation and memory. My use of the decolonial archive derails kinship's commitments to heteronormative conventions, while exploiting genealogy's idiomatic kinship with reproductive familiality to turn a (hetero) normative narrative of existential continuity into a narrative of political accountability to a Hawaiian-Hawaii.
