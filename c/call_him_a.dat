5|$|An {{individual}} {{identified as}} Mac Ragnaill (son of Ragnall) by the annals {{may have been}} Ragnall's son, though no name is given. In 942 Mac Ragnaill led a raid on Downpatrick, but within a week {{he was killed by}} Matudán, Overking of Ulster. The Annals of the Four Masters call Mac Ragnaill a jarl, but the Annals of Ulster <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> king. The Annals of the Four Masters also suggests he and his fellow plunderers came from an island.|$|E
5|$|When Wilson {{proposed}} {{establishment of}} a League of Nations, with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles, Taft expressed public support. He was {{out of step with}} his party, whose senators were not inclined to ratify the treaty. Taft's subsequent flip-flop on the issue of whether reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides, destroying any remaining influence he had with the Wilson administration, and causing some Republicans to <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party. The Senate refused to ratify the Versailles pact.|$|E
5|$|With {{the growth}} of {{scholarly}} criticism in the 17th and 18th centuries, fewer historians believed Philip to be a Christian. Historians had become increasingly aware of secular texts, which did not describe Philip as a Christianand which, indeed, recorded him participating as pontifex maximus (chief priest) over the millennial Secular Games in 248. Modern scholars are divided on the issue. Some, like Hans Pohlsander and Ernst Stein, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are ambiguous, based on oral rumor, and do not vouch for a Christian Philip; others, like John York, Irfan Shahîd, and Warwick Ball, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are clear and dependable enough that Philip {{can be described as}} a Christian; still others, like Glen Bowersock, argue that the sources are strong enough to describe Philip as a man interested in and sympathetic to Christianity, but not strong enough to <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> Christian.|$|E

Few <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> fighting force, few <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> hasty man. Few <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> political genius.

25|$|In August 2007, Masuzoe was {{appointed}} as Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare. He served {{in this position}} until 2009 under three consecutive prime ministers (Shinzō Abe, Yasuo Fukuda and Tarō Asō). Abe reportedly appointed Masuzoe, a frequent critic of Abe's policies, to silence critics who would <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> factionalist. Masuzoe came under fire during his tenure for an incident {{in which the government}} failed to match 50 million pension records with their owners, which led Democratic Party of Japan head Ichirō Ozawa to call for Masuzoe's censure if he did not apologize.|$|E

25|$|The Child of Thorns, Chise's {{master and}} fiancé, once apprenticed to Master Lindenbaum. A being with both fae and human elements, his origins are a mystery. Known as the Thorn Sorcerer, the other faeries {{see him as}} an abomination, {{something}} he does not mind. Besides using glamour to hide his appearance, he can control and also turn himself into shadows, and when angry enough, he takes on a more monstrous form. He can even change his head to a human’s using magic. Despite claiming to lack human emotions, after some time caring for Chise he has slowly developed a true fondness for her. However, his innate lack of understanding certain human emotions makes Lindenbaum <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> child. He dislikes children. He says {{they do not have}} magic powers, but they are talented in being able to see the true nature of things, so sometimes he is found out. He is called “Pilum Murialis” by the wizards.|$|E
500|$|Penn Jillette, then a {{columnist}} for PC/Computing, accepted that Idol wasn't well versed in computers, but considered it a non-issue.

No details are known of his work, except his assistance in painting costumes and heraldry for tournaments, but the king gave him a salary and accommodation, {{and it is likely}} that Piers made portraits for the court. Piers returned to Flanders from Inverkeithing in July 1508. Some references in the royal accounts <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Frenchman".|$|E

500|$|Geoffrey's ambitions {{may have}} {{included}} becoming King of England, which {{may account for}} some of the harshness that his two legitimate half-brothers displayed towards him. His military abilities, displayed in the rebellion of 1173–1174, as well his custody of castles near Tours, would have also fed into Richard's disquiet over Geoffrey's possible intentions. Geoffrey was known to be ambitious, which led the historian D. L. Douie to <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> [...] "formidable bastard". The historian Ralph Turner said of Geoffrey that [...] "he sought power and wealth despite the handicap of his birth" [...] and that he had [...] "inherited the bad temper of the other Plantagenets".|$|E
500|$|Black Hawk's own account, {{though he}} was not present at the battle's second day, termed the {{incident}} a massacre. Later histories continued to assail {{the actions of the}} whites at Bad Axe. The 1887 Perry A.

In 1898, during events honoring the 66th anniversary of the battle, Reuben Gold Thwaites termed the fight a [...] "massacre" [...] during a speech at the battle site.

500|$|By this time, {{though still}} {{described}} as an asura, Kubera is offered prayers {{at the end of}} all ritual sacrifices. His titles, such as [...] "best of kings" [...] and [...] "Lord of kings" [...] (Harivamsa indicate that Kubera is made [...] "Lord of kings"), in contrast to the god-king of heaven, Indra, whose title of [...] "best of gods" [...] led to the later belief that Kubera was a man. The early texts Gautama Dharmashastra and Apastamba describe him as a man. Only the Grihyasutras of Shankhayana and Hiranyakesin <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> god, and suggest offerings of meat, sesame seeds and flowers to him.|$|E

500|$|The record {{producer}} John Culshaw described Monteux as [...] "that rarest of beings– {{a conductor}} who was loved by his orchestras ... to <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> legend {{would be to}} understate the case." [...] Toscanini observed that Monteux had the best baton technique he had ever seen. Like Toscanini, Monteux insisted on the traditional orchestral layout with first and second violins to the conductor's left and right, believing that this gave a better representation of string detail than grouping all the violins together on the left. On fidelity to composers' scores, Monteux's biographer John Canarina ranks him with Klemperer and above even Toscanini, whose reputation for strict adherence to the score was, in Canarina's view, less justified than Monteux's.|$|E

In an attempt to persuade him, Peter challenges Mickey to a drinking contest, which Peter wins. During the contest, Peter and Mickey talk about American looks and diet in a drunk language.
