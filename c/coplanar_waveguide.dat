40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the use of capacitive loading of <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguides</b> to reduce their line length and, thus the size, of monolithic microwave integrated circuits is presented. The reduced sized <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguides</b> are compared to unloaded transmission lines and to lumped element transmission line segments. The phase bandwidth, defined by 2 percent error in S(sub 21), and the return loss bandwidth, defined by a return loss greater than 15 dB, of <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguides</b> reduced from 0 to 90 percent are compared, and the insertion loss {{as a function of the}} size reduction is presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} detailed {{characterization of}} {{a category of}} edge-suspended <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguides</b> that were fabricated on low-resistivity silicon substrates using improved CMOS-compatible micromachining techniques. The edge-suspended structure is proposed to provide reduced substrate loss and strong mechanical support at the same time. It is revealed that, at radio or microwave frequencies, the electromagnetic waves are highly concentrated {{along the edges of}} the signal line. Removing the silicon underneath the edges of the signal line, along with the silicon between the signal and ground lines, can effectively reduce the substrate coupling and loss. The edge-suspended structure has been implemented by a combination of deep reactive ion etching and anisotropic wet etching. Compared to the conventional silicon-based <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguides,</b> which show an insertion loss of 2. 5 dB/mm, the loss of edge- suspended <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguides</b> with the same dimensions is reduced to as low as 0. 5 dB/mm, and a much reduced attenuation per wavelength (dB/lambda(g)) at 39 GHz. Most importantly, the edge-suspended <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguides</b> feature strong mechanical support provided by the silicon remaining underneath the center of the signal line. The performance of the <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguides</b> is evaluated by high-frequency measurement and full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation. In addition, the resistance, inductance, conductance, capacitance (RLGC) line parameters and the propagation constant of the <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguides</b> (CPWs) were extracted and analyzed...|$|R

50|$|<b>Coplanar</b> <b>waveguide</b> {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} planar transmission line which can be fabricated using printed circuit board technology, and is used to convey microwave-frequency signals. On a smaller scale, <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguide</b> transmission lines are also built into monolithic microwave integrated circuits. Conventional <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguide</b> (CPW) consists of a single conducting track printed onto a dielectric substrate, together with a pair of return conductors, one to either side of the track. All three conductors are {{on the same side of}} the substrate, and hence are coplanar. The return conductors are separated from the central track by a small gap, which has an unvarying width along the length of the line. Away from the cental conductor, the return conductors usually extend to an indefinite but large distance, so that each is notionally a semi-infinite plane.|$|E

50|$|Coplanar waveguides play an {{important}} role in the field of solid state quantum computing, e.g. for the coupling of microwave photons to a superconducting qubit. In particular the research field of circuit quantum electrodynamics was initiated with <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguide</b> resonators as crucial elements that allow for high field strength and thus strong coupling to a superconducting qubit by confining a microwave photon to a volume that is much smaller than the cube of the wavelength. To further enhance this coupling, superconducting <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguide</b> resonators with extremely low losses were applied. (The quality factors of such superconducting coplanar resonators at low temperatures can exceed 106 even in the low-power limit.)

50|$|<b>Coplanar</b> <b>waveguide</b> (CPW) has {{the return}} {{conductors}} {{on top of}} the substrate in the same plane as the main line, unlike stripline and microstrip where the return conductors are ground planes above or below the substrate. The return conductors are placed either side of the main line and made wide enough that they can be considered to extend to infinity. Like microstrip, CPW has quasi-TEM propagation.|$|E
50|$|The {{electromagnetic}} wave carried by a <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguide</b> exists partly in the dielectric substrate, and partly {{in the air}} above it. In general, the dielectric constant of the substrate will be different (and greater) than that of the air, so that the wave is travelling in an inhomogeneous medium. In consequence CPW will not support a true TEM wave; at non-zero frequencies, both the E and H fields will have longitudinal components (a hybrid mode).|$|E
50|$|Transitions between {{conductive}} {{lines and}} dielectric lines or waveguides are more complex. In these cases {{a change of}} mode is required. Transitions of this sort consist of forming some kind of antenna in one format {{that acts as a}} launcher into the new format. Examples of this are <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguide</b> (CPW) or microstrip converted to slotline or substrate integrated waveguide (SIW). For wireless devices, transitions to the external antennae are also required.|$|E

5000|$|Making circuit {{elements}} out of transmission lines is most useful at microwave frequencies. At lower frequencies the longer wavelength makes these components too bulky. At the higher microwave frequencies planar transmission line formats are generally too lossy and waveguide is used instead. Waveguide, however, is more bulky {{and more expensive}} to manufacture. At still higher frequencies dielectric waveguide (such as optical fibre) becomes the technology of choice. However, there are planar formats of dielectric waveguide. [...] The most widely used planar formats are stripline, microstrip, suspended stripline, and <b>coplanar</b> <b>waveguide.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Stripline was {{initially}} preferred to its rival {{because of the}} dispersion issue. However, in the 1960s, the need to incorporate miniature solid-state components in MICs swung the balance to microstrip. Miniaturisation also leads to favouring microstrip because its disadvantages are not so severe in a miniaturised circuit. However, stripline is still chosen where operation over a wide band is required. [...] The first planar slab dielectric line, imageline, is due to King in 1952. Slotline, the first printed planar dielectric line format, is due to Cohn in 1968. [...] <b>Coplanar</b> <b>waveguide</b> is due to Wen in 1969. [...] Finline, as a printed technology, is due to Meier in 1972. [...] However, Robertson created finline-like structures much earlier (1955-56) with metal inserts. Robertson fabricated circuits for diplexers and couplers and coined the term finline.|$|E
