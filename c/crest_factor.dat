25|$|Five signal {{descriptors}} were considered: RMS power, EBU3341/R128 integrated loudness, <b>crest</b> <b>factor,</b> EBU3342 LRA, {{and density}} of clipped samples. RMS power {{accounts for the}} signal's physical level, EBU3341 loudness for the perceived level. The <b>crest</b> <b>factor,</b> which {{is the difference between}} the signal's peak and its average power, is on occasions considered as a basis for the measure of micro-dynamics, for instance in the TT Dynamic Range Meter plug-in. Finally, EBU3342 LRA has been repeatedly considered as a measure of macro-dynamics or dynamics in the musical sense.|$|E
25|$|In other words, fast-attack {{compressors}} increase {{both physical}} and perceptual levels, but only slightly. They decrease the density of clipped samples, and decrease both <b>crest</b> <b>factor</b> and macro-dynamics.|$|E

5000|$|In general, {{modulation}} {{techniques that}} have smaller <b>crest</b> <b>factors</b> usually transmit more {{bits per second}} than modulation techniques that have higher crest factors.This is because(1) Any given linear amplifier has some [...] "peak output power"—some maximum possible instantaneous peak amplitude it can support and still stay in the linear range.(2) The average power of the signal is the peak output power divided by the crest factor.(3) The number of bits per second transmitted (on average) {{is proportional to the}} average power transmitted (Shannon-Hartley theorem).|$|R
30|$|Figure  11 {{also shows}} that with a 64 -QAM {{modulation}} using the same bandwidth a smaller coherence gain of 2.2 dB is achieved. This can be partly attributed to the different <b>crest</b> <b>factors</b> of 16 -QAM and 64 -QAM modulations, which are 2.55 and 3.68 dB, respectively. There is also a 1.2 -dB difference in the output signal levels of the 16 -QAM and 64 -QAM modulations, where 64 -QAM has the higher signal level. This difference {{is caused by the}} scaling done by the RF equipment, which could have been calibrated out. However, this would not change the coherence gain results.|$|R
40|$|Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) is a spectrally efficient multicarrier modulation technique for high speed data transmission over multipath fading channels, but has low power efficiency.

25|$|Since {{the basic}} {{indicator}} system in either an analog or digital meter responds to DC only, a multimeter includes an AC to DC conversion circuit for making alternating current measurements. Basic meters utilize a rectifier circuit {{to measure the}} average or peak absolute value of the voltage, but are calibrated to show the calculated root mean square (RMS) value for a sinusoidal waveform; this will give correct readings for alternating current as used in power distribution. User guides for some such meters give correction factors for some simple non-sinusoidal waveforms, to allow the correct root mean square (RMS) equivalent value to be calculated. More expensive multimeters include an AC to DC converter that measures the true RMS value of the waveform within certain limits; the user manual for the meter may indicate {{the limits of the}} <b>crest</b> <b>factor</b> and frequency for which the meter calibration is valid.

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{a network}} of {{transcription}} factors that specifies neural crest identity in the ectoderm has been defined, expression of neural <b>crest</b> transcription <b>factors</b> does not guarantee eventual migration as a neural crest cell. While much work has gone into determining regulatory relationships within the transcription factor network, the ability of protein modifications like phosphorylation to modulate the function of neural <b>crest</b> regulatory <b>factors</b> and determine when {{and where they are}} active also has crucial implications. Paladin, which was previously classified as a phosphatase based on sequence similarity, is expressed in chick neural crest precursors and is maintained throughout their epithelial to mesenchymal transition and migration. Loss of Paladin delays the expression of transcription factors Snail 2 and Sox 10 in premigratory neural crest cells, but does not affect accumulation of FoxD 3, Cad 6 B or RhoB, indicating that Paladin differentially modulates the expression of genes previously thought to be coregulated within the neural crest gene regulatory network. Both gain and loss of Paladin function result in disrupted neural crest migration, reinforcing the importance of precisely regulated phosphorylation for neural crest migration. Mutation of critical, catalytic cysteine residues within Paladin's predicted phosphatase active site motifs did not abolish the function of Paladin in the neural crest. Collectively, these data indicate that Paladin is an antiphosphatase that modulates the activity of specific neural <b>crest</b> regulatory <b>factors</b> during neural <b>crest</b> development.

In this paper this problematic is investigated by comparing the responses measured by two different isotropic broadband probes typically used to perform electric field (E-field) evaluations. The broadband probes are submitted to signals with variable duty cycles (DC) and <b>crest</b> <b>factors</b> (CF) either with or without Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation but with the same root-mean-square (RMS) power. The two probes do not provide accurate enough results for deterministic signals such as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WIMAX) or Long Term Evolution (LTE) as well as for non-deterministic signals such as Wireless Fidelity (WiFi). The legacy measurement protocols should be adapted to cope for the emerging wireless communication technologies based on the OFDM modulation scheme. This is not easily achieved except when the statistics of the RF emission are well known. In this case the measurement errors are shown to be systematic and a correction factor or calibration can be applied to obtain a good approximation of the total RMS power...|$|R
40|$|Harmonic {{complexes}} {{that generate}} highly modulated temporal envelopes on the basilar membrane (BM) mask a tone less effectively than complexes that generate relatively flat temporal envelopes, because the non-linear active gain of the BM selectively amplifies a low-level tone in the dips of a modulated masker envelope. The present study examines {{a similar effect}} in speech recognition. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured for a voice masked by harmonic complexes with partials in sine phase (SP) or in random phase (RP). The masker's fundamental frequency (F 0) was 50, 100 or 200 Hz. SRTs were considerably lower for SP than for RP maskers at 50 -Hz F 0, but the two converged at 100 -Hz F 0, while at 200 -Hz F 0, SRTs were a little higher for SP than RP maskers. The results were similar whether the target voice was male or female and whether the masker's spectral profile was flat or speech-shaped. Although listening in the masker dips {{has been shown to}} play a large role for artificial stimuli such as Schroeder-phase complexes at high levels, it contributes weakly to speech recognition in the presence of harmonic maskers with different <b>crest</b> <b>factors</b> at more moderate sound levels (65 dB SPL) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{measurement}} of complex waveforms {{such as those}} found in spread spectrum CDMA/W-CDMA and higher order QAM modulation systems has traditionally been a demanding challenge. Analog Devices has developed a range of TruPwr ™ detectors that enable the {{measurement of}} these complex signals at RF frequencies. The TruPwr ™ detectors provide the user with an accurately scaled dc voltage, that is rms equivalent of the input waveform. Within the TruPwr ™ range Analog Devices offers products applicable to both wireless and wireline infrastructure applications. and devices packaged in small footprint for portable applications. Modern communications systems utilize complex modulation schemes to provide increasing data rates. The resulting signals have large and changing <b>crest</b> <b>factors</b> (peak to average ratios). To avoid clipping of these signals, power amplifiers (PAs) must be operated in their linear region where they are less efficient and, thus, consume higher levels of power.

40|$|The {{discomfort}} of standing people experiencing steady-state vibration can be predicted from the root-mean-square (rms) of the frequency-weighted acceleration, but alternative methods are advocated for evaluating motions containing transients. Using {{the method of}} magnitude estimation, 20 standing subjects estimated the discomfort caused by octave-bandwidth random vibrations at two centre frequencies (1 and 8 Hz) in each of three directions (fore-and-aft, lateral and vertical). For motions having seven different <b>crest</b> <b>factors</b> (i. e. {{the ratio of the}} peak to the rms value), the vibration magnitude required for similar discomfort, and a method predicting this equivalence, were determined. The rms method (with an exponent of 2) and the root-mean-quad method (exponent of 4) tended to, respectively, underestimate and overestimate the {{discomfort of}} high-crest factor motions. The optimum evaluation method had an exponent of about 3. 0 for 1 -Hz motions and 3. 5 for 8 -Hz motions. Current standards do not provide reliable indications of when vibration discomfort can be predicted by an rms measure. Statement of Relevance: Current standards recommend alternatives to the root-mean-square method (exponent of 2. 0) for predicting the discomfort caused by transient vibration. The alternatives include the root-mean-quad or vibration dose value (exponent of 4. 0) and peak values. An exponent of 2. 0 underestimates, but an exponent of 4. 0 slightly overestimates, the discomfort of transients experienced by standing people. Peak values are not appropriate. <br/...|$|R

OFDM is being considered for the next-generation of wireless systems both with and without direct sequence spreading and the resultant spreading-based multi-carrier CDMA systems have numerous attractive properties. This volume provides the reader with a broad overview of the research on OFDM systems during their 40 -year history. Part I commences with an easy to read conceptual, rather than mathematical, treatment of the basic design issues of OFDM systems. The discussions gradually deepen to include adaptive single and multi-user OFDM systems invoking adaptive turbo coding. Part II introduces the taxonomy of multi-carrier CDMA systems and deals with the design of their spreading codes and the objective of minimising their <b>crest</b> <b>factors.</b> This part also compares the benefits of adaptive modulation and space-time coding with the conclusion that in conjunction with multiple transmitters and receivers the advantages of adaptive modulation gradually erode both in OFDM and MC-CDMA systems. Part III addresses a host of advanced channel estimation and multi-user detection problems in the context of Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) systems. Aimed at the mathematically advanced reader, this part provides a range of implementation-ready solutions, performance results and future research issues.

40|$|Cellular {{nucleic acid}} binding protein (CNBP) is a strikingly conserved zinc-finger nucleic acid {{chaperone}} required for forebrain development. Its depletion causes forebrain truncation mainly {{as a consequence}} of a reduction in size of craniofacial structures and neural crest derivatives. The CNBP expression pattern is complex and highly dynamic, but little is known of the underlying mechanisms regulating its spatiotemporal pattern. CNBP expression is highly conserved between all vertebrates characterized. In this study we have combined comparative sequence analysis and in vivo testing of DNA fragments in zebrafish to identify evolutionarily constrained regulatory motifs that likely control expression of the cnbp gene in embryos. We found a novel exon sequence located 50 upstream of the Exon 1 -sequence reported in most databases, and two transcription start sites that generate two primary-transcripts that differ in their 50 UTRs and expression profile during zebrafish embryonic development. Furthermore, we found a region inside the intron 1 sequence that controls the cnbp developmental- specific transcriptional activation. Conserved binding sites for neural <b>crest</b> transcription <b>factors</b> were identified in this region.

40|$|Whole-body {{vibration}} exposure of locomotive engineers and the vibration attenuation {{of seats in}} 22 U. S. locomotives (built between 1959 and 2000) was studied during normal revenue service and following international measurement guidelines. Triaxial vibration measurements (duration mean 155 min, range 84 - 383 min) on the seat and on the floor were compared. In addition to the basic vibration evaluation (aw rms), the vector sum (av), the maximum transient vibration value (MTVV/aw), the vibration dose value (VDV/(aw T 1 / 4)), and the vibration seat effective transmissibility factor (SEAT) were calculated. The power spectral densities are also reported. The mean basic vibration level (aw rms) was for the fore-aft axis x = 0. 18 m/sec 2, the lateral axis y = 0. 28 m/sec 2, and the vertical axis z = 0. 32 m/sec 2. The mean vector sum was 0. 59 m/sec 2 (range 0. 27 to 1. 44). The <b>crest</b> <b>factors</b> were generally at or above 9 in the horizontal and vertical axis. The mean MTVV/aw was 5. 3 (x), 5. 1 (y), and 4. 8 (z), and the VDV/(aw T 1 / 4) values ranged from 1. 32 to 2. 3 (x-axis), 1. 33 to 1. 7 (y-axis), and 1. 38 to 1. 86 (z-axis), generally indicating high levels of shocks. The mean seat transmissibility factor (SEAT) was 1. 4 (x) and 1. 2 (y) and 1 (z), demonstrating a general ineffectiveness {{of any of the}} seat suspension systems. In conclusion, these data indicate that locomotive rides are characterized by relatively high shock content (acceleration peaks) of the vibration signal in all directions. Locomotive vertical and lateral vibrations are similar, which appears to be characteristic for rail vehicles compared with many road/off-road vehicles. Tested locomotive cab seats currently in use (new or old) appear inadequate to reduce potentially harmful vibration and shocks transmitted to the seated operator, and older seats particularly lack basic ergonomic features regarding adjustability and postural support...|$|R
