25|$|Nighttime {{wind power}} is {{considered}} the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel, because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day, but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day. Therefore, the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative. Off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the U.S. averaged 1.64 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2009, but only 0.71 cents/kWh during the least expensive six hours of the day. Typically, wholesale electricity costs 2 to 5 cents/kWh during the day. <b>Commercial</b> <b>fuel</b> synthesis companies suggest they can produce fuel for less than petroleum fuels when oil costs more than $55 per barrel. and Water |conference= 4th International Conference on Energy Sustainability, May 17â€“22, 2010 |location= Phoenix, Arizona |publisher= American Society of Mechanical Engineers |url= http://dotyenergy.com/PDFs/Doty-90366-TransportFuels-ASME-ES10.pdf |accessdate= September 7, 2012}} The U.S. Navy estimates that shipboard production of jet fuel from nuclear power would cost about $6 per gallon. While that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010, {{it is expected to}} be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue. Moreover, since the delivery of fuel to a carrier battle group costs about $8 per gallon, shipboard production is already much less expensive. However, U.S. civilian nuclear power is considerably more expensive than wind power. The Navy's estimate that 100 megawatts can produce 41,000 gallons of fuel per day indicates that terrestrial production from wind power would cost less than $1 per gallon.|$|E
