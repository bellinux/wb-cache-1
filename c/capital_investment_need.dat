40|$|The recent global {{economic}} downturn {{in a number}} of economies was preceded by rising credit market risk brought on by a massive financial market failure. This paper develops a small open economy model that analyzes the interaction of business cycle volatilities with capital accumulation and the subsequent impacts on economic growth. We use a stochastic dynamic programming model to test the central hypothesis that rising volatility shocks is an inhibitor to capital accumulation and subsequently economic growth. The model illustrates that traditional capital-based growth models which assume a constant capital stock are not consistent with the business cycle variation in capital accumulation. Furthermore, it appears that an increase in precautionary savings arising from a stochastic shock does not completely translate into productive <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> <b>need</b> for growth, since risk-averse households will seek out risk-free government or foreign assets. We find this conclusion consistent with the empirical findings of Ramey et al (1995) and Badinger (2009) who both argued that, business cycle volatility is important to the growth discussion because of its robust net negative effect on output growth.

The financial incentives and bonds would hopefully cover most of the initial <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> <b>needed</b> {{to build the}} railroad.

Most of the engineers and surveyors who figured out how and where to build the railroad on the Union Pacific were engineering college trained. Many of Union Pacific engineers and surveyors were Union Army veterans (including two generals) who had learned their railroad trade keeping the trains running and tracks maintained during the U.S. Civil War. After securing the finances and selecting the engineering team, the next step was to hire the key personnel and prospective supervisors. Nearly all key workers and supervisors were hired because they had previous railroad on-the-job training, knew what needed to be done and how to direct workers to get it done. After the key personnel were hired, the semi-skilled jobs could be filled if there was available labor. The engineering team's main job was to tell the workers where to go, what to do, how to do it, and provide the construction material they would need to get it done.|$|R

Papers presented at CAES meetings are not subject to the journal’s standard refereeing process. The Issue Over the past 25 years, traditional agricultural co-operatives have been challenged by competition from local investor-owned firms and multinational companies, deregulation and globalization of trade, and increased market concentration in suppliers and purchasers. At the same time, co-operatives have constantly been seeking to add value to their member services through expansion and/or adoption of new technology. The <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> <b>needed</b> for these endeavours has to be financed, and for traditional co-operatives the major source of financing new investments has been long-term borrowing. As a result some co-operatives are characterized by high debt loads, which may result in increased financial risk exposure. Important factors that may influence the level of financial risk exposure are the potential conflicts between managerial self-interest and the interest of the owners of the firm (Jensen, 1986; Jensen and Meckling, 1976) and the impact of these differences on the choice of capital structure (Friend and Lang, 1988...|$|R

The "MESSAGE-Access" model is employed to assess the cost effectiveness of centralized and Decentralized Distributed Generation (DDG) technologies. Delivery mechanisms are modeled to include mini-grid and stand-alone systems and the analysis includes an estimation of rural household electricity demand from lighting and appliances. We assume two future demand scenarios with a minimum threshold and a higher threshold of electricity consumption of 65 and 420 kWh per household per year, respectively. We find {{that the cost of}} delivering electricity by centralized generation and grid distribution is up to four times the cost of stand-alone and mini-grid DDG option in the case of minimum threshold demand scenario. These results are robust to alternate assumptions regarding costs of technologies. We also estimate that public subsidy bill for kerosene can be substantially reduced if all households switch to electricity as their primary source of lighting.

In March 2014 Healthcare at Home said that it was no longer accepting new ‘high risk’ patients such as those suffering from haemophilia or respiratory diseases like cystic fibrosis because it could not guarantee getting their drugs to them on time or in full. The company blamed IT issues and a ‘system failure’ relating to the firm’s outsourcing of its logistics and warehousing departments. Dave Roberts, chief executive of the National Clinical Homecare Association, says there are questions about whether the rapid growth and low profit margins in the sector have contributed to the situation. ‘There’s been 20% growth in this sector year on year for several years now in terms of numbers of patients - that’s a very rapid expansion.

40|$|The {{potential}} of using acid hydrogen peroxide for lowering the electrical energy consumption during production of Black spruce (Picea mariana) thermomechanical pulp (TMP) was investigated. The chemical system, {{which consisted of}} ferrous sulphate, hydrogen peroxide and optionally an enhancer [ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (sodium salt), 3, 4 -dimethoxybenzyl (veratryl) alcohol or oxalic acid/sodium oxalate], was evaluated as an inter-stage treatment where the primary refiner {{was used as a}} mixer. The approach has the advantage of minimising the <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> <b>needed</b> for implementation, thus being directly applicable in a thermomechanical pulping process consisting of two or more refiners in series. The results obtained in a pilot plant trial revealed that is was possible to significantly reduce the specific energy consumption by approximately 20 -and 35 % to a freeness value of 100 ml CSF by using 1 and 2 % hydrogen peroxide, respectively. The energy reduction could be obtained without any substantial change in fibre length, fractional composition of the pulp or tensile strength of the paper. The tear strength was slightly reduced however, as was the pulp yield. The major drawback with the acid hydrogen peroxide system was a reduction in brightness by at least 6 brightness units.

Through our research we were to determine a product and a market that could be manufactured using this fully recycled glass swarf. Background: Mr. Sauer receives the swarf from major glass manufacturers as a fine powder glass suspended in an organic dispersant and water. The swarf is produced through an industrial glass cutting process that results in the glass powder dispersed in water and recyclable glass disks; both are used in the project. Mr. Sauer's swarf studio testing has yet to produce any product with a value great enough to justify processing the swarf. Many of these limitations were believed to be due to the unknown composition and characteristics of the swarf as well as the limited lab testing ability of Mr. Sauer in his studio space.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an estimate of}} the potential for energy efficiency improvements in the U. S. building sector by 2030. The analysis uses the Energy Information Administration's AEO 2007 Reference Case as a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, and applies percentage savings estimates by end use drawn from several prior efficiency potential studies. These prior studies include the U. S. Department of Energy's Scenarios for a Clean Energy Future (CEF) study and a recent study of natural gas savings potential in New York state. For a few end uses for which savings estimates are not readily available, the LBNL study team compiled technical data to estimate savings percentages and costs of conserved energy. The analysis shows that for electricity use in buildings, approximately one-third of the BAU consumption can be saved at a cost of conserved energy of 2. 7 cents/kWh (all values in 2007 dollars), while for natural gas approximately the same percentage savings is possible at a cost of between 2. 5 and 6. 9 $/million Btu. This cost-effective level of savings results in national annual energy bill savings in 2030 of nearly $ 170 billion. To achieve these savings, the cumulative <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> <b>needed</b> between 2010 and 2030 is about $ 440 billion, which translates to a 2 - 1 / 2 year simple payback period, or savings {{over the life of the}} measures that are nearly 3. 5 times larger than the investment required (i. e., a benefit-cost ratio of 3. 5) ...|$|R
