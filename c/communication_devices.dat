Alternative methods of access such as Target Scanning (also known as eye pointing) calibrate the movement of a user's eyes to direct an SGD to produce the desired speech phase.

5|$|Blissymbols {{were first}} used in Canada in 1971 to provide {{communication}} to those {{not able to}} use traditional orthography; their use quickly spread to other countries. With improved technology, keyboard <b>communication</b> <b>devices</b> developed in Denmark, the Netherlands and the US increased in portability; the typed messages were displayed on a screen or strip of paper. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, <b>communication</b> <b>devices</b> were being commercially produced, and a few, such as the HandiVoice, had voice output. Countries such as Sweden, Canada and the United Kingdom initiated government-funded services for those with severe communication impairments, including developing centres of clinical and research expertise.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s, {{improvements}} in technology {{led to a}} greatly increased number, variety, and performance of commercially available <b>communication</b> <b>devices,</b> {{and a reduction in}} their size and price. Alternative methods of access such eye pointing or scanning became available on <b>communication</b> <b>devices.</b> Speech output possibilities included digitized and synthesized speech, with text-to-speech options available in German, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish and Ewe. AAC services became more holistic, seeking to develop a balance of aided and unaided strategies with the goal of improving functioning in the person's daily life, and greater involvement of the family. Increasingly, individuals with acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, head injury, and locked-in syndrome, received AAC services. In addition, with the challenge to the notion of AAC prerequisites, those with severe to profound intellectual impairments began to be served. Courses on AAC were developed for professional training programs, and literature such as textbooks and guides were written to support students, clinicians and parents.|$|E

40|$|A general <b>communication</b> <b>device</b> is {{a device}} that at every {{stage of the game}} {{receives}} a private message from each player, and in return sends a private signal to each player; the signals the device sends depend on past play, past signals it sent, and past messages it received. An autonomous correlation device is a general <b>communication</b> <b>device</b> where signals depend only on past signals the device sent, but not on past play or past messages it received. We show that the set of all equilibrium payoffs in extended games that include a general <b>communication</b> <b>device</b> coincides with the set of all equilibrium payoffs in extended games that include an autonomous correlation device.

5|$|One twin-turreted T-26 {{was given}} to the Research Institute of Communication in March 1932 to develop special tank <b>communication</b> <b>devices.</b> The plan was to equip each tank with a keyphone, while a platoon commander's tank would be {{equipped}} with a telephone switch for 6 subscribers (four for the tanks in the platoon, one for communication with infantry and one for contacting headquarters). A special terminal block was mounted on the rear of the tank so that communication wires could be connected. The work remained experimental.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{progress}} in {{hardware and software}} development continued, including projects funded by the European Community. The first commercially available dynamic screen speech generating devices were developed in the 1990s. At the same time synthesized speech was becoming available in more languages.

High-tech devices have continued to reduce in size and weight, while increasing accessibility and capacities.

5|$|Modern use of AAC {{began in}} the 1950s with systems {{for those who had}} lost the ability to speak {{following}} surgical procedures. During the 1960s and 1970s, spurred by an increasing commitment in the West towards the inclusion of disabled individuals in mainstream society and developing the skills required for independence, the use of manual sign language and then graphic symbol communication grew greatly. It was not until the 1980s that AAC began to emerge as a field in its own right.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel {{communication}} and evaluation scenario for user interaction with a <b>communication</b> <b>device</b> (television). To improve user experience with communication services, we merge three domains: social signal processing, human action recognition and human-computer interaction. Our scenario includes applied and theoretical solutions about user interaction with a <b>communication</b> <b>device.</b> We declared the atom actions, which {{are represented by}} unique hand gestures and replace functions on the remote controller. On the other hand, we include some social signals like agreement and disagreement, which can represent a user’s reaction to currently played content. The advantage of our solution is the hierarchical communication scenario that allows the user to quit the procedure at any step. On the other hand, the computation time of low-level features within a recognition step represents the biggest drawback. The use of our method allows the user to control the <b>communication</b> <b>device</b> using hand gestures. Likewise, the use of social signals in interaction can improves the user experience with the <b>communication</b> <b>device...</b>|$|R
