50|$|The {{innermost}} loop {{regulates the}} current in the torque motor. This type of motor creates torque that is nearly {{proportional to the}} rotor current, {{even if it is}} forced to turn backward. Because of the action of the commutator, there are instances when two rotor windings are simultaneously energized. If the motor was driven by a voltage <b>controlled</b> <b>voltage</b> source, the current would roughly double, as would the torque. By sensing the current with a small sensing resister (RS) and feeding that voltage back to the inverting input of the drive amplifier, the amplifier becomes a voltage controlled current source.

5000|$|An ideal {{voltage source}} is a two-terminal device that {{maintains}} a fixed voltage drop across its terminals. It {{is often used}} as a mathematical abstraction that simplifies the analysis of real electric circuits. If the voltage across an ideal voltage source can be specified independently of any other variable in a circuit, it is called an independent voltage source. Conversely, if the voltage across an ideal voltage source is determined by some other voltage or current in a circuit, it is called a dependent or <b>controlled</b> <b>voltage</b> source. A mathematical model of an amplifier will include dependent voltage sources whose magnitude is governed by some fixed relation to an input signal, for example. [...] In the analysis of [...] faults on electrical power systems, the whole network of interconnected sources and transmission lines can be usefully replaced by an ideal (AC) voltage source and a single equivalent impedance.|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”In a {{conventional}} parallel plate MEMS variable capacitor, the capacitance versus voltage response (C-V response) has been deterministic. In this work, the C-V response is tuned versatilely {{through the application}} of a <b>control</b> <b>voltage</b> to an additional electrode in order that the initial gap between the parallel capacitor plates is set by the <b>control</b> <b>voltage.</b> Then, the capacitor plates are lifted (capacitance decreases) as the actuation voltage applied to the levering actuator increases. In this manner, the shape of the C-V response can be controlled even after the device is fabricated. At a zero <b>control</b> <b>voltage,</b> the fabricated MEMS variable capacitor exhibited a convex shape in the C-V response (i. e. the capacitance decreases slowly in the low actuation voltage region and rapidly in the high actuation voltage region). When 3 V was applied to the <b>control</b> <b>voltage,</b> the capacitor exhibited an almost linear C-V response with a linearity factor of 0. 999. At 5 V of <b>control</b> <b>voltage,</b> the C-V response changed to a relatively concave shape (i. e. the capacitance decreases rapidly in the low actuation voltage region and slowly in the high actuation voltage region). The capacitance tuning ratio of the fabricated device exceeded 120 % at all <b>control</b> <b>voltages.</b> The proposed C-V response tuning capability is vital and amenable to various circuit demands.

These situations are very common when the oscillator {{is part of a}} phase-locked loop (PLL). In PLLs, the reference frequency as well as the divide ratios are known at the time of design. Therefore the desired frequency of the <b>voltage</b> (current) <b>controlled</b> oscillator is known but not the <b>controlling</b> <b>voltage</b> (current). We formulate this problem as the solution of an appropriate nonlinear equation. We present robust and efficient numerical techniques for solving this nonlinear equation both in time and frequency domain. We demonstrate using experimental results that this technique is at par with classical methods of calculating oscillator steady-state and period of oscillation for a given <b>control</b> <b>voltage.</b> We show that compared to a search-based approach to calculating the desired <b>control</b> <b>voltage</b> or current, our direct method is a order of magnitude faster for the same accuracy.
