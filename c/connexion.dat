5|$|In 1779, the {{congregation}} of Hanley Wesleyan Chapel were {{expelled from the}} chapel for supporting Alexander Kilham. Kilham denounced the Methodist conference for giving too much power to church ministers, at the expensive of the laity; his disagreements led to a schism in the Methodist church and his founding of the Methodist New <b>Connexion.</b> In Hanley, the New <b>Connexion</b> congregation, foremost led by William Smith, Job Meigh and George and John Ridgway, initially met {{in the house of}} one of its prominent members, and then acquired a coach-house at the corner of Albion Street that was converted into a meeting house. During the following year the first chapel was built on the site with seating for 600people. It was formally opened by Wiliam Thom, the first president of the New <b>Connexion,</b> and Alexander Kilham, its secretary. This chapel {{was the head of the}} Hanley Circuit, and by 1812 this Circuit was the strongest in the New <b>Connexion.</b> During the previous year the chapel had been expanded to seat 1,000. It was still too small for the size of {{the congregation}} and was demolished and replaced by the present chapel in 1819.|$|E
5|$|The literary, {{as well as}} the historical, {{value of}} the Historia Augusta has {{suffered}} greatly {{as a result of the}} method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to <b>connexion</b> or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no <b>connexion,</b> has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.|$|E
5|$|John Wesley preached in Shakerley four times, between 1748 and 1752, {{laying the}} {{foundations}} for a place of worship. In the 1780s George Whitfield who worked with Wesley early in his ministry also preached there. Tyldesley's first place of worship, Top Chapel {{was built in the}} Square in 1789 for the Countess of Huntingdon's <b>Connexion</b> which had broken from the Church of England. Thomas Johnson, gifted the site on the highest point of Tyldesley and Lady Huntingdon, a supporter of Wesley supplied money for building materials. The chapel became known as Top Chapel from its geographical location.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, an Atari Jaguar port of Another World was {{confirmed}} {{and approved by}} Chahi. It was released as a limited collector's item in cartridge form, complete with a box and manual published by the association Retro-gaming <b>Connexion</b> (RGC) in 2013. The game engine was rewritten especially for the Atari Jaguar {{to make use of}} the console's several processors: the GPU and blitter perform polygon rendering; the GPU performs on-the-fly data decompression; the DSP plays stereo music and sound effects; and the 68000 CPU performs JIT compilation and execution of the scripts. The Jaguar version is playable in the original graphics 16-color mode and Deluxe 15th Anniversary graphics 256-color mode. It can be played in normal and speed-run modes. It supports five languages: English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish.|$|E
5|$|The first Methodist chapel on {{the site}} was built by the Methodist New <b>Connexion</b> in the late 18th century. Finding the {{building}} too small for their growing membership, the congregation replaced it with the current building in 1819, to the designs of a local amateur architect. The chapel is built over two stories {{and is in the}} Italianate style, with further work to expand the building completed in 1859 and 1887. It became a GradeII* listed building in 1972. By the end of the 20th century, the building had deteriorated and the congregation had decreased considerably; it was closed for active worship in 1985. After passing through a number of owners, it was acquired by the Historic Chapels Trust in 2002 and is undergoing an extensive restoration scheme.|$|E
