40|$|AbstractThe {{samples of}} feed coal, <b>cleaned</b> <b>coal,</b> middlings, slime and gangue were {{collected}} from Xiqu, Antaibao and Heidaigou coal preparation plants, China. The analyses of minerals, ash, sulfur and 20 hazardous trace elements were performed on the samples by SEM/EDX, INAA, ICP-AES, CV-AAS, GAAS and also on the samples from experimental products (by heavy-media, electrostatic separation and forth-floatation). Partitioning of sulfur and these trace elements under the conditions of different coal ranks and coal preparation types were discussed. The {{results show that the}} partitioning behavior of a given element during the cleaning processes is mainly controlled by its modes of occurrence, the distribution forms of its carrier minerals and the cleaning technique types. Although hazardous trace elements have diverse degrees of removal due to different coal ranks and coal preparation types, the elements associated with fine minerals (e. g. Pb, U and Be) and organic constituents (e. g. Br and Cl) will not be effectively reduced by physical coal cleaning and may still be enriched in the <b>cleaned</b> <b>coal.</b> As to the coarse sized feeds (particle size > 0. 5 mm), the elements associated with coarse/epigenetic minerals can be removed more easily by gravity separation methods and report to the gangue and slime. As to the finer-grained feeds (< 0. 5 mm), the elements associated with minerals with a high dielectric coefficient are easily removed by electrostatic separation; in comparison with the larger-sized fractions (74 – 150 µm), the smaller-sized fractions (< 74 µm) show a high removability of elements by forth-floatation as a whole. The physical coal cleaning is not only effective in the removal of ash and sulfur, but also in reducing the concentration of most hazardous trace elements. However, as byproducts, the middlings, especially the slimes are preferentially enriched in many hazardous elements (e. g. Cr, Ni and Mo), so that these fractions have a potential of environmental risk and should not be directly used as fuel...|$|E

The effect of treating conditions, including {{the size of}} coal, treatment time, the ratio of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide and microwave radiation power on the rate of desulfurization were studied by single factor method. The result shows that 60.2  % total sulfur can be removed after treated under the conditions: microwave power 850  W, the concentration of coal slurry 3 / 50 (g/mL), the particle size of coal ≤ 0.23  mm, treatment time is 20  min and the ratio of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide 1 : 1 (V/V). Taking acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide as oxygenant, the desulfurization experiments by microwave were carried out by Chen (2013). It is indicated that {{the ratio of the}} acetic acid and H 2 O 2 has great influence on desulfurization efficiency and <b>cleaned</b> <b>coal</b> yield. When the ratio is 1 : 2 (V/V), high desulfurization rate and the <b>cleaned</b> <b>coal</b> yield are obtained. At this ratio, desulfurization rate increases with irradiation time, while bonding index G extend rapidly to decline over time. Microwave desulfurization combined with peracetic acid can get high desulfurization rate, but the time of desulfurization should not be too long. XPS analysis shows that thiophene sulfur removal rate reached 46.03  % under the optimal oxidation conditions. Zhao et al. (2011) also pointed out that oxidant volume ratio has a great influence on desulfurization, and in his study under the condition of the optimal ratio 1 : 1, microwave power 700  W, irradiation time 120  s, the desulfurization rate is 49.19  %. Meanwhile with nitric acid as oxidant, desulfurization experiments by microwave were carried out (Zhao et al. 2011). 1  g of coal and 139  mL nitric acid of 1.4  mol were mixed together, then exposed to microwave with a frequency of 2, 450  MHz, power 700  W for 12  min, and the desulfurization rate of 47.1  % was achieved. In this process, oxidation takes place between pyrite and nitric acid, and sulfur oxides such as sulfate, SO 2 were produced, so as to achieve the purpose of removal of inorganic sulfur.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: China is a {{dominant}} energy consumer {{in a global}} context and current energy forecasts emphasise that China’s future energy consumption also will rely heavily on coal. The coal use is {{the major source of}} the greenhouse gas CO 2 and particles causing serious health damage. This paper looks into the question if coal washing might work as low cost strategy for both CO 2 and particle emission reductions. Coal washing removes dirt and rock from raw coal, resulting in a coal product with higher thermal energy and less air pollutants. Coal cleaning capacity has so far not been developed in line with the market potential. In this paper an emerging market for <b>cleaned</b> <b>coal</b> is studied within a CGE model for China. The macro approach catches the repercussions of coal cleaning through increased energy efficiency, lower coal transportation costs and crowding out effect of investments in coal washing plants. Coal cleaning stimulates economic growth and reduces particle emissions, but total energy use, coal use and CO 2 emissions increase through a rebound effect supported by the vast reserve of underemployed labourers. A carbon tax on fossil fuel combustion has a limited effect on total emissions. The reason is a coal leakage to tax exempted processing industries...|$|E

40|$|Many {{advanced}} {{fine coal}} cleaning technologies {{have been developed}} in recent years {{under the auspices of}} the U. S. Department of Energy. However, they are not as widely deployed in industry as originally anticipated. An important reason for this problem is that the <b>cleaned</b> <b>coal</b> product is difficult to dewater because of the large surface area associated with fine particles. Typically, mechanical dewatering, such as vacuum filtration and centrifugation, can reduce the moisture to 20 - 35 % level, while thermal drying is costly. To address this important industrial problem, Virginia Tech has developed a novel dewatering process, in which water is displaced from the surface of fine particulate materials by liquid butane. Since the process is driven by the hydrophobic interaction between coal and liquid butane, it was referred to as hydrophobic dewatering (HD). A fine coal sample with 21. 4 pm median size was subjected to a series of bench-scale HD tests. It was a mid-vol bituminous coal obtained from the Microcel flotation columns operating at the Middle Fork coal preparation plant, Virginia. All of the test results showed that the HD process can reduce the moisture to substantially less than 10 %. The process is sensitive to the amount of liquid butane used in the process relative to the solids concentration in the feed stream. Neither the intensity nor the time of agitation is critical for the process. Also, the process does not require long time for phase separation. Under optimal operating conditions, the moisture of the fine coal can be reduced to 1 % by weight of coal...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to produce electrode binder pitch with sulfur content below 0. 6 wt% from high-sulfur Illinois coal mild gasification liquids.

In this project, two approaches to sulfur reduction are being explored in conjunction with FTC: (1) the use of conventionally <b>cleaned</b> <b>coal</b> with low ({approximately} 1 %) sulfur as a mild gasification feedstock, and (2) direct biodesulfurization of the liquids prior to FTC.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the accomplishments toward project goals {{during the first}} six months of the third year of the project to assess the properties and performance of coal based products. These products are in the gasoline, diesel and fuel oil range and result from coal based jet fuel production from an Air Force funded program. Specific areas of progress include generation of coal based material that has been fractionated into the desired refinery cuts, acquisition and installation of a research gasoline engine, and modification of diesel engines for use in evaluating diesel produced in the project. Characterization of the gasoline fuel indicates a dominance of single ring alkylcycloalkanes that have a low octane rating; however, blends containing these compounds do not have a negative effect upon gasoline when blended in refinery gasoline streams. Characterization of the diesel fuel indicates a dominance of 3 -ring aromatics that have a low cetane value; however, these compounds do not have a negative effect upon diesel when blended in refinery diesel streams. The desulfurization of sulfur containing components of coal and petroleum is being studied so that effective conversion of blended coal and petroleum streams can be efficiently converted to useful refinery products. Equipment is now in place to begin fuel oil evaluations to assess the quality of coal based fuel oil. Combustion and characterization of fuel oil indicates that the fuel is somewhere in between a No. 4 and a No. 6 fuel oil.
