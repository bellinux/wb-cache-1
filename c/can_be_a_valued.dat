This simulator is based on power electronic converter controlled {{in such a way}} that will behave as a PV panel. Thus, in this paper a PV panel simulator based on a two quadrant DC/DC power converter is proposed. This topology will allow to achieve fast responses, like suddenly changes in the irradiation and temperature. To control the power converter it will be used a fast and robust sliding mode controller. Therefore, with the proposed system I-V curve simulation of a PV panel is obtained. Experimental results from a laboratory prototype are presented in order to confirm the theoretical operation...|$|E
40|$|With {{the rising}} {{prevalence}} {{of children with}} Social, Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties (SEBD) in the secondary sector (Cooper & Whitbread 2007), many schools are establishing Nurture Groups (NGs), a government endorsed intervention (DCSF 2008; 2009; DfEE 1997; 1998; DfES 1999; 2002 a). These were created by Boxall (1976) and are designed to emulate missed or deprived early childhood experiences. The intervention {{has been associated with}} Attachment Theory (Bowlby 1969; 1973; 1981). However, there is little research indicating that an intervention primarily targeted at infant schools can be applied effectively to secondary settings (Cooper & Tiknaz 2007; Cooke, Yeoman & Parkes 2008). Therefore, the main aim of this research was to explore how NGs are implemented into the secondary sector and whether they can be a beneficial intervention for children with SEBD. It examined the implementation of three secondary school NGs through the views of 17 secondary school staff and eight parents using focus groups, and six children who had attended the NGs through individual interviews. The data were then analysed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke 2006). Findings showed that secondary school NGs <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>valued</b> resource and have benefits for those within them. However, they have a different emphasis from those originally devised by Boxall (1976). This was felt to be influenced by the age of the children and subsequent attachment needs. Therefore, practitioners need knowledge of adolescent development and attachment theory to implement NGs successfully. They also need to consider carefully methods of communication and dissemination of NG aims and practices to school and home. Educational Psychologists are strategically placed to help secondary school NGs, due to their knowledge of child development, attachment theory and psychological tools/techniques to aid communication. They could also {{play an important role in}} supporting NG staff to fulfil their pivotal and challenging role in the lives of these children...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Health {{policy in}} the UK and {{elsewhere}} is prioritising patient empowerment and patient evaluations of healthcare. Patient reported outcome measures now take centre-stage in implementing strategies to increase patient empowerment. This article argues for consideration of patient empowerment itself as a directly measurable patient reported outcome for chronic conditions, highlights some issues in adopting this approach, and outlines a research agenda to enable healthcare evaluation {{on the basis of}} patient empowerment. Discussion Patient empowerment is not a well-defined construct. A range of condition-specific and generic patient empowerment questionnaires have been developed; each captures a different construct e. g. personal control, self-efficacy/self-mastery, and each is informed by a different implicit or explicit theoretical framework. This makes it currently problematic to conduct comparative evaluations of healthcare services on the basis of patient empowerment. A case study (clinical genetics) is used to (1) illustrate that patient empowerment <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>valued</b> healthcare outcome, even if patients do not obtain health status benefits, (2) provide a rationale for conducting work necessary to tighten up the patient empowerment construct (3) provide an exemplar to inform design of interventions to increase patient empowerment in chronic disease. Such initiatives could be evaluated on the basis of measurable changes in patient empowerment, if the construct were properly operationalised as a patient reported outcome measure. To facilitate this, research is needed to develop an appropriate and widely applicable generic theoretical framework of patient empowerment to inform (re) development of a generic measure. This research should include developing consensus between patients, clinicians and policymakers about the content and boundaries of the construct before operationalisation. This article also considers a number of issues for society and for healthcare providers raised by adopting the patient empowerment paradigm. Summary Healthcare policy is driving the need to consider patient empowerment as a measurable patient outcome from healthcare services. Research is needed to (1) tighten up the construct (2) develop consensus about what is important to include (3) (re) develop a generic measure of patient empowerment for use in evaluating healthcare (4) understand if/how people make trade-offs between empowerment and gain in health status. </p...|$|E
