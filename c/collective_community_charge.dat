5000|$|In Scotland, {{criticism}} has been levied {{not so much}} at {{the principle of the}} tax, but at its debt collection arrangements: <b>Community</b> <b>Charge</b> and Council Tax debts can be pursued up to 40 years later - few people will have conserved their payment receipts {{for such a long time}} and as such are unable to prove that they paid.

John Wilson MSP presented an Enforcement of Local Tax Arrears (Scotland) Bill on 19 March 2010 in order to try to reduce this collection time from 20 to 5 years.
