25|$|The {{absence of}} a central {{authority}} meant that one band could not force another band to return their <b>captives.</b> Chiefs Buffalo Hump and Peta Nocona never agreed to return any <b>captives</b> to the Texian settlers. <b>Captives</b> were often assimilated into the society and adopted into families, and the Comanche made little distinction between people born Comanche and those adopted. The Comanche practice of taking <b>captives</b> dated back to at least the early 18th century with raids into Spanish New Mexico.

Another large lemur colony the Myakka City Lemur Reserve run by the Lemur Conservation Foundation (LCF), which also hosts lemur research. In Madagascar, Lemurs' Park is a free-range, private facility southwest of Antananarivo that exhibits lemurs for the public while also rehabilitating captive-born lemurs for reintroduction into the wild.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the recent}} successes in Cincinnati, the captive-breeding program has {{remained}} controversial. Proponents {{argue that the}} zoos have not only aided the conservation effort by studying the reproductive habits, raising public awareness and education about the rhinos, helping raise financial resources for conservation efforts in Sumatra but, moreover, to have established a small <b>captive</b> breeding group. Opponents of the <b>captive</b> breeding program argue that the losses are too great; the program is too expensive; removing rhinos from their habitat, even temporarily, alters their ecological role; and <b>captive</b> populations cannot match the rate of recovery seen in well-protected native habitats. In October 2015 Harapan, the last rhino in the Western Hemisphere, left the Cincinnati Zoo to Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|From a {{husbandry}} {{point of}} view, hyenas are easily kept, {{as they have}} few disease problems {{and it is not}} uncommon for <b>captive</b> hyenas to reach 15–20 years of age. Nevertheless, the spotted hyena was historically scantily represented in zoos, and was typically obtained in order to fill empty cages until a more prestigious species could be obtained. In subsequent years, animals considered to be more charismatic were allocated larger and better quality facilities, while hyenas were often relegated to inferior exhibits. In modern times, the species faces spatial competition from more popular animals, especially large canids. Also, many <b>captive</b> individuals have not been closely examined to confirm their sexes, thus resulting in non-breeding pairs often turning out to be same-sexed individuals. As a result, many <b>captive</b> hyena populations are facing extinction.|$|E

Other unsuccessful breeding programs were tried in the 1990s: at ESF at Syracuse; at the Wildlife Conservation Park/Bronx Zoo; an early effort at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo (then called the Burnet Park Zoo); at the Seneca Park Zoo (Rochester, New York); and at the Buffalo Zoo.

5|$|Mortality under captivity is {{generally}} high; reasons include stillbirths, birth defects, cannibalism, hypothermia, neglect of cubs by mothers, and infectious diseases. A study comparing {{the health of}} <b>captive</b> and wild cheetahs noted that despite having similar genetic make-up, wild cheetahs are far healthier than their <b>captive</b> counterparts. The study identified possible stress factors such as restricted habitat and interaction with human beings and other carnivores, and recommended private and spacious areas for <b>captive</b> cheetahs. A study of diseases suffered by <b>captive</b> cheetahs in the period 1989–92 in several North American zoos showed that hepatic veno-occlusive disease, a disease of the liver, had affected 82% of the deceased cheetahs, caused nine deaths, and occurred in 51% of living females. Chronic gastritis was detected in 91% of the population. Glomerulosclerosis, a disease of the kidneys, emerged as another significant disease, affecting 84% of the cheetahs; another renal disease, nephrosclerosis, affected 39% of the cheetahs. Feline infectious peritonitis caused two deaths. Pneumonia was a major cause for juvenile deaths. Another study concluded that excess of vitaminA in their diets could result in veno-occlusive disease in their livers.|$|E
