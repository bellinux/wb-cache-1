5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a <b>class</b> is too big to be a set {{if it can be}} put into one-to-one correspondence with the <b>class</b> of all sets. He defined a set as a <b>class</b> that is a member of some <b>class</b> and stated the axiom: A <b>class</b> is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the <b>class</b> of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any <b>class.</b> Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the <b>class</b> of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this <b>class</b> and the <b>class</b> of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the <b>class</b> of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the U <b>class</b> is complex as it {{is linked to the}} fate of the 2-cylinder K ("River") <b>class</b> 2-6-4 tank locomotives. The design work had for a new {{passenger}} 2-6-0 with 6ft (1.83 m) driving wheels was complete by 1927, when the involvement of a K <b>class</b> locomotive in the Sevenoaks rail crash presented an opportunity to bring forward construction of the <b>class.</b> The K <b>class</b> tank engines were the passenger counterpart to the N <b>class</b> 2-6-0 mixed-traffic design, and were noted for rough-riding over the cheaply laid track of the former SECR. The <b>class</b> was withdrawn from service, and the inquiry that followed determined that the rough-riding contributed to the crash. Its recommendation was that the K <b>class</b> should be rebuilt to 2-6-0 tender locomotives, using tried and tested features used by Maunsell and his assistant, the former GWR engineer Harold Holcroft on the N <b>class.</b>|$|E

5|$|All {{members of}} the <b>class</b> entered British Railways service in 1948, and from 1955 23 of the U <b>class</b> {{received}} chimneys of the British Railways Standard <b>Class</b> 4 variety and replacement cylinders, which had become worn through intensive use. A few {{members of the}} <b>class</b> were given replacement frames at overhaul with a shallower curve between the front buffer beam and smokebox. During the early 1960s, {{the withdrawal of the}} ageing T9 <b>class</b> designed by Dugald Drummond saw the U <b>class</b> replacing them on services west of Exeter, though their large wheels offered little advantage on the steeper gradients that characterised this part of the railway network. The favoured form of 2-6-0 motive power west of Exeter was the smaller-wheeled N <b>class,</b> while heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid’s Unrebuilt Light Pacifics, which were within the weight restrictions imposed in this area. The U <b>class</b> represented one of the less glamorous classes of passenger locomotive {{due to the fact that}} they were used mainly on mixed-traffic and secondary passenger duties.|$|E

5|$|<b>Class</b> III {{dollars are}} {{identical}} to the <b>Class</b> II dollar, except lettering similar to that on the <b>Class</b> I dollars {{was applied to the}} edge of the coins. Based on the slightly concave appearance of the <b>Class</b> III dollars, it is likely that all were given edge lettering at some point after striking; as the Castaing machine was meant to be used prior to striking, its improper use resulted in a deformation of the coin surface. Newman and Bressett assert that they were struck at approximately the same time as the <b>Class</b> II dollars, and that the edges were lettered and the coins concealed by Mint employees until 1869, when one was offered to a coin collector, who rejected it as a restrike. However, numismatist S. Hudson Chapman believed that some <b>Class</b> III dollars were struck as late as 1876. In 1875, several were sold by Philadelphia coin dealer John W. Haseltine.
