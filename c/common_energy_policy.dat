50|$|On 14 June 2006 Alliance for Sweden {{agreed on}} a <b>common</b> <b>energy</b> <b>policy.</b> It will apply over the next {{parliamentary}} term (2006-2010), and includes a promise not to shut down any more nuclear reactors during that period (Barsebäck 2 was shut down in 2005). The proposal is that no more reactors are to be built, that the nuclear phase-out law will be repealed and that all forms of energy research will be legal and able to receive state grants (research on nuclear power is currently forbidden in Sweden). An Alliance government would also grant any applications to increase {{the output of the}} existing plants, provided that it would be safe to do so. This has been hailed as a historic step, as disagreement over nuclear power has long plagued the centre-right in Sweden: the Centre Party opposes nuclear power, the Moderates and Christian Democrats support its continuing operation while the Liberals want to build more reactors. Some doubts have been raised about the long-term survival of this compromise, as neither the Centre Party nor the Liberals have changed their fundamental positions on nuclear power.|$|E

Based on the experience and observations of the review, I attempt to analyze and explain the current status of the European <b>common</b> <b>energy</b> <b>policy</b> and the issues surrounding it. With regard to the European <b>common</b> <b>energy</b> <b>policy,</b> the situation to date has been that individual directives have been issued for each issue, and a comprehensive energy policy was finally agreed on and shaped in 2007. This European <b>common</b> <b>energy</b> <b>policy</b> is characterized by a unique policy method in which ambitious policy targets are laid down and efforts of individual member countries to achieve them are urged, for example ownership unbundling of gas and electricity supply and distribution, and the achievement of three 20 % targets by 2020 with regard to energy and environmental issues. However, the state of implementation and compliance in individual member countries of past directives such as gas and electricity liberalization, renewable energy, and energy-efficiency are in far from a satisfactory condition. For example it has been observed that, with regard to certain energy policy directives where the actual situation deviates from past targets, these have simply been switched to other long-term targets. Nothing is as hollow as setting policy targets that are not accompanied by sound implementation and compliance. Currently, in individual policies there is seen some partial strengthening of legal force and postponement of targets, but there still remains a concern that unless there is drastic improvement with respect to their implementation and compliance, the European <b>common</b> <b>energy</b> <b>policy</b> could be reduced to being merely a formal procedure for political decisions. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{article will}} analyse the global and geopolitical {{dimensions of the}} future international energy security {{and its implications for}} Europe and the EU- 27. In this context, I will discuss to which extent the EU's newly proclaimed "Energy Action Plan" of the EU Spring summit of 2007 and its declared <b>common</b> <b>energy</b> (foreign) <b>policy</b> are a sufficient strategy to cope with the new global and geopolitical challenges. The article concludes the following: (1) The interlinkage between globally designed traditional energy security concepts - that rely just on economic factors and "market-strategies" - and domestic as well as regional political stability demands new thinking with regard to both energy supply security and foreign and security policies. (2) Although after the Russian-Ukrainian gas conflict in January 2006, energy security has forced its way up the European <b>energy</b> and foreign <b>policy</b> agendas, the EU- 27 member states have largely failed to forge a coherent European energy security and <b>energy</b> foreign <b>policy</b> strategy after their Spring summit of 2007 because its declared political solidarity has been still lacking. But the 2 nd Strategic Energy Review of November 2008 has recommended new initiatives to overcome this lack by promoting concrete infrastructure and other projects for enhancing Europe's supply security and its political solidarity as part of a <b>common</b> <b>energy</b> (foreign) <b>policy.</b> If the EU is able to implement the March 2007 and November 2008 decisions, the EU oil and gas demand will drastically reduce and freeze at current levels. In this case, Putin's <b>energy</b> <b>policies</b> by using Russia's energy resources and pipeline monopolies as a political instrument to enforce its economic and geopolitical interests will be proved as self-defeating in Russia's long-term strategic interests.

TRI controls for gas dependency, transit route diversification, political risks of transit, pipeline rupture probability, and {{the balance of power}} between supplying and consuming countries along the transit route. Evaluating TRI for the EU-Russia gas trade, we show that the introduction of the Nord Stream pipeline would further widen already large disparities in gas risk exposure across the EU Member States. The gas risk exposure of the Member States served by Nord Stream would decline. In contrast, EU countries not connected to Nord Stream, but sharing other Russian gas transit routes with the Nord Stream countries, would face greater gas risk exposure.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{bilateral cooperation}} between developed countries (home country) {{and developing countries}} (host country) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to enhance carbon dioxide sinks. With the home-host country pair as the unit of analysis, our logistic regression model examines 158 Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) investment projects from 1993 until 2002 across 2541 country-pairs. Because the marginal costs of reducing emissions may be lower in developing countries, the AIJ projects served as a policy laboratory to assess whether such investments might be advantageous to both countries in the event future regimes allowed emission credits from such bilateral projects. Instead of investing in home countries where maximum pollution reductions (or carbon sequestration) might be possible, home countries invest in locations where they can conduct their policy experiments at low transaction costs. Prior trade and aid relationships were used as a proxy. Regarding energy projects, location decisions are driven by home countries’ desire to reduce air pollution that they receive from abroad. Geography – proximity of a host country to a home country – in interaction with host country's coal production, {{is a very important}} driver of location decision in AIJ energy sector projects. Location of sequestration projects is impacted by the host country's potential for avoiding deforestation as well as by previous aid and trade patterns between a home and a host country.
