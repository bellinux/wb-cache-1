5|$|Apple modeled {{the design}} of Xgrid on the Zilla program, {{distributed}} with NeXT's OPENSTEP operating system application programming interface (API), which Apple owned the rights to. The company also opted to provide the client version of Mac OS X with only <b>command-line</b> functions and little flexibility, while giving the Mac OS X Server version of Xgrid a GUI control panel and {{a full set of}} features.|$|E
5|$|From version 2.0 to 9.0, FreeBSD {{used the}} sysinstall program as its main installer. It {{was written in}} C by Jordan Hubbard. It uses a text user interface, and is divided {{into a number of}} menus and screens {{that can be used to}} {{configure}} and control the installation process. It can also be used to install Ports and Packages as an alternative to the <b>command-line</b> interface.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{graphical}} BitLocker interface in Windows Vista {{could only}} encrypt {{the operating system}} volume. Starting with Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008, volumes other than the operating system volume could be encrypted using the graphical tool. Still, {{some aspects of the}} BitLocker (such as turning autolocking on or off) had to be managed through a <b>command-line</b> tool called manage-bde.wsf.|$|E
5|$|The {{latest version}} of BitLocker, first {{included}} in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, adds the ability to encrypt removable drives. On Windows XP or Windows Vista, read-only access to these drives can be achieved through a program called BitLocker To Go Reader, if FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT filesystems are used. In addition, a new <b>command-line</b> tool called manage-bde replaced the old manage-bde.wsf.|$|E
5|$|It {{provides}} network administrators {{a method}} of creating a computing cluster, which allows them to exploit previously unused computational power for calculations that can be divided easily into smaller operations, such as Mandelbrot maps. The setup of an Xgrid cluster can be achieved at next to no cost, as Xgrid client is pre-installed on all computers running Mac OS X 10.4 to Mac OS X 10.7. The Xgrid client {{was not included in}} Mac OS X 10.8. The Xgrid controller, the job scheduler of the Xgrid operation, is also included within Mac OS X Server and as a free download from Apple. Apple has kept the <b>command-line</b> job control mechanism minimalist while providing an API to develop more sophisticated tools built around it.|$|E
5|$|PHP code may be {{embedded}} into HTML or HTML5 markup, {{or it can}} be used {{in combination}} with various web template systems, web content management systems and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server software combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a <b>command-line</b> interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.|$|E
5|$|PHP is a {{general-purpose}} {{scripting language}} that is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. Any PHP code in a requested file is executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on websites or elsewhere. It {{can also be used}} for <b>command-line</b> scripting and client-side graphical user interface (GUI) applications. PHP can be deployed on most web servers, many operating systems and platforms, and can be used with many relational database management systems (RDBMS). Most web hosting providers support PHP for use by their clients. It is available free of charge, and the PHP Group provides the complete source code for users to build, customize and extend for their own use.|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} boot loader {{appealing}} to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow {{flexibility in the}} booting process such as network boot using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader can be manipulated at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may boot into a more basic <b>command-line</b> or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action. The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.|$|E
25|$|Graphical user {{interface}} (GUI) wrappers circumvent the <b>command-line</b> interface versions (CLI) of (typically) Linux and Unix-like software applications and their text-based {{user interface}}s or typed command labels. While <b>command-line</b> or text-based application allow users {{to run a}} program non-interactively, GUI wrappers atop them avoid the steep learning curve of the <b>command-line,</b> which requires commands to be typed on the keyboard. By starting a GUI wrapper, users can intuitively interact with, start, stop, and change its working parameters, through graphical icons and visual indicators of a desktop environment, for example.|$|E
25|$|Mac OS X {{users can}} utilize Apple's AAC encoder with the <b>command-line</b> afconvert tool.|$|E
25|$|Added upload and upload-reply capability, <b>command-line</b> {{execution}} for events, explicit credentials, {{and support}} for Windows 2000.|$|E
25|$|A <b>command-line</b> {{interface}} {{is a type}} of {{user interface}} operated entirely through a keyboard, or another device doing the job of one.|$|E
25|$|These <b>command-line</b> {{tools are}} {{commonly}} used by shell scripts and programs like ABCDE, Exact Audio Copy and foobar2000 to convert audio to AAC.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, there was {{considerable}} experimentation with {{ways to improve the}} BBS experience from its <b>command-line</b> interface roots. Almost every popular system improved matters somewhat by adding ANSI-based color menus to make reading easier, and most also allowed cursor commands to offer <b>command-line</b> recall and similar features. Another common feature was the use of autocomplete to make menu navigation simpler, a feature that would not re-appear on the web until decades later.|$|E
25|$|Scripting {{languages}} {{are often used}} to create batch processes. One common scripting language is Unix shell, and its executing environment is called the <b>command-line</b> interface.|$|E
25|$|Users {{can control}} a Windows 9x-based system through a <b>command-line</b> {{interface}} (or CLI), or a {{graphical user interface}} (or GUI). For desktop systems, the default mode is usually graphical user interface, where the CLI is available through MS-DOS windows.|$|E
25|$|Encoding and {{transcoding}} {{video and}} audio from one format to another. <b>Command-line</b> utilities afconvert (to convert audio formats), avconvert (to convert video formats) and qtmodernizer (to automatically convert older formats to H.264/AAC) are provided with macOS for power users.|$|E
25|$|In March 2016, Microsoft {{announced}} that it would support the Ubuntu userland on top of the Windows 10 kernel by implementing the Linux system calls as a subsystem. The focus lies on <b>command-line</b> tools like Bash and is therefore primarily directed towards developers.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} table {{contains a}} selection of the cmdlets that ship with PowerShell, noting similar commands in other well-known <b>command-line</b> interpreters. Many of these similar commands come out-of-the-box defined as aliases within PowerShell, making it easy for people familiar with other common shells to start working.|$|E
25|$|Two <b>command-line</b> {{versions}} are provided: 7z.exe, using external libraries; and a standalone executable 7za.exe, containing built-in modules, but with compression/decompression support limited to 7z, ZIP, gzip, bzip2, Z and tar formats. A 64-bit version is available, with support for large memory maps, leading to faster compression. All versions support multi-threading.|$|E
25|$|A user may install or {{uninstall}} an MSI {{package in}} passive mode or silent mode, bypassing this phase entirely. (Passive mode bypasses the user interface phase but shows a graphical progress bar. Silent mode shows nothing.) During installation, information gathered {{in this phase}} may be supplied beforehand through the <b>command-line</b> interface.|$|E
25|$|His work {{is being}} {{extended}} and carried on by his son Aza Raskin at Humanized, a company that was started shortly after Raskin's death to continue his legacy. Humanized released Enso, a linguistic <b>command-line</b> interface, {{which is based on}} Jef's work and dedicated in his memory. In early 2008, Humanized became part of Mozilla.|$|E
25|$|The user {{interface}}, {{also known}} as the shell, is either a <b>command-line</b> interface (CLI), a graphical user interface (GUI), or through controls attached to the associated hardware, which is common for embedded systems. For desktop systems, the default mode is usually a graphical user interface, although the CLI is commonly available through terminal emulator windows or on a separate virtual console.|$|E
25|$|IIS 7.5 was {{included}} in Windows 7 (but it must be turned on in the side panel of Programs and Features) and Windows Server 2008 R2. IIS 7.5 improved WebDAV and FTP modules as well as <b>command-line</b> administration in PowerShell. It also introduced TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 support and the Best Practices Analyzer tool and process isolation for application pools.|$|E
25|$|Apple's {{original}} {{concept for}} the Macintosh deliberately sought {{to minimize the}} user's conceptual awareness of the operating system. Many basic tasks that had required more operating system knowledge on other systems could then be accomplished by mouse gestures and graphic controls on a Macintosh. This would differentiate it from its contemporaries such as MS-DOS, which use a <b>command-line</b> interface consisting of tersely abbreviated textual commands.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft backs an {{open-source}} {{effort to}} support OpenDocument in Office 2007, {{as well as}} earlier versions (up to Office 2000), through a converter add-in for Word, Excel and PowerPoint, and also a <b>command-line</b> utility. As of 2008, the project supports conversion between ODF and Office Open XML file formats for all three applications. According to ODF Alliance this support falls short and substantial improvements are still needed for interoperability in real-world situations.|$|E
25|$|Applications {{may also}} provide both interfaces, {{and when they}} do the GUI is usually a WIMP wrapper around the <b>command-line</b> version. This is {{especially}} common with applications designed for Unix-like operating systems. The latter used to be implemented first because it allowed the developers to focus exclusively on their product's functionality without bothering about interface details such as designing icons and placing buttons. Designing programs this way also allows users to run the program in a shell script.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the {{permissive}} {{nature of}} the BSD license has allowed many other operating systems, both free and proprietary, to incorporate BSD code. For example, Microsoft Windows has used BSD-derived code in its implementation of TCP/IP and bundles recompiled versions of BSD's <b>command-line</b> networking tools since Windows 2000. Also Darwin, the system on which Apple's macOS is built, is a derivative of 4.4BSD-Lite2 and FreeBSD. Various commercial Unix operating systems, such as Solaris, also contain varying amounts of BSD code.|$|E
25|$|Most recent stable {{versions}} {{run on the}} ARMv3/ARMv4 RiscPC, the ARMv5 Iyonix, ARMv7 Cortex-A8 processors (such as {{that used}} in the BeagleBoard and Touch Book) and Cortex-A9 processors (such as that used in the PandaBoard). There is a development version for the Raspberry Pi. SD card images have been made available for downloading free of charge to Raspberry Pi 1, 2 & 3 users with a full graphical user interface (GUI) version and a <b>command-line</b> interface only version (RISC OS Pico, at 3.8MB).|$|E
25|$|RNA-Seq {{experiments}} {{generate a}} {{large volume of}} raw sequence reads, which have to be processed to yield useful information. Data analysis usually requires a combination of bioinformatics software tools (see also List of RNA-Seq bioinformatics tools) that {{vary according to the}} experimental design and goals. The process can be broken down into four stages: quality control, alignment, quantification, and differential expression. Most popular RNA-Seq programs are run from a <b>command-line</b> interface, either in a Unix environment or within the R/Bioconductor statistical environment.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft {{attempted}} {{to address some}} of these shortcomings by introducing the Windows Script Host in 1998 with Windows 98, and its <b>command-line</b> based host: cscript.exe. It integrates with the Active Script engine and allows scripts to be written in compatible languages, such as JScript and VBScript, leveraging the APIs exposed by applications via COM. However, it has its own deficiencies: its documentation is not very accessible, and it quickly gained a reputation as a system vulnerability vector after several high-profile computer viruses exploited weaknesses in its security provisions. Different versions of Windows provided various special-purpose command line interpreters (such as netsh and WMIC) with their own command sets but they were not interoperable.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the basic}} {{concepts}} and mechanisms of early versions of MS-DOS resembled those of CP/M. Internals like file-handling data structures were identical, and both referred to disk drives with a letter (A:, B:, etc.). MS-DOS's main innovation was its FAT file system. This similarity {{made it easier to}} port popular CP/M software like WordStar and dBase. However, CP/M's concept of separate user areas for files on the same disk was never ported to MS-DOS. Since MS-DOS had access to more memory (as few IBM PCs were sold with less than 64 KB of memory, while CP/M could run in 16 KB if necessary), more commands were built into the <b>command-line</b> shell, making MS-DOS somewhat faster and easier to use on floppy-based computers.|$|E
25|$|Every {{version of}} Microsoft Windows for {{personal}} computers has included a command line interpreter (CLI) {{for managing the}} operating system. Its predecessor, MS-DOS, relied exclusively on a CLI. These are COMMAND.COM in MS-DOS and Windows 9x, and cmd.exe in the Windows NT family of operating systems. Both supports a few basic internal commands. For other purposes, a separate console application. They also include a basic scripting language (batch files), {{which can be used}} to automate various tasks. However, they cannot be used to automate all facets of graphical user interface (GUI) functionality, in part because <b>command-line</b> equivalents of operations are limited, and the scripting language is elementary. In Windows Server 2003, the situation was improved, but scripting support was still unsatisfactory.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} {{problems}} with the Embedded SQL approach. Like the different varieties of SQL, the Embedded SQLs that used them varied widely, not only from platform to platform, but even across languages on one platform – a system that allowed calls into IBM's DB2 would look very different from one that called into their own SQL/DS. Another key problem to the Embedded SQL concept was that the SQL code could only be changed in the program's source code, so that even small changes to the query required considerable programmer effort to modify. The SQL market referred to this as static SQL, versus dynamic SQL which could be changed at any time, like the <b>command-line</b> interfaces that shipped with almost all SQL systems, or a programming interface that left the SQL as plain text until it was called. Dynamic SQL systems became a major focus for SQL vendors during the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} the art in sensory {{intelligence}} for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions, rather than a <b>command-line</b> interface. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It will probably {{be a long time before}} robots interact as naturally as the fictional C-3PO, or Data of Star Trek, Next Generation.|$|E
25|$|On June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs {{announced}} in his keynote {{address at the}} annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference that Apple would be {{making the transition from}} PowerPC to Intel processors over the following two years, and that Mac OS X would support both platforms during the transition. Jobs also confirmed rumors that Apple had versions of Mac OS X running on Intel processors for most of its developmental life. Intel-based Macs would run a new recompiled version of OS X along with Rosetta, a binary translation layer which enables software compiled for PowerPC Mac OS X to run on Intel Mac OS X machines. The system was included with Mac OS X versions up to version 10.6.8. Apple dropped support for Classic mode on the new Intel Macs. Third party emulation software such as Mini vMac, Basilisk II and SheepShaver provided support for some early versions of Mac OS. A new version of Xcode and the underlying <b>command-line</b> compilers supported building universal binaries that would run on either architecture.|$|E
