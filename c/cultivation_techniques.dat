A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques</b> produced {{what was known}} as the Dust Bowl in South Dakota and several other plains states.

The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with local bank foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state. The population of South Dakota declined by more than 7% between 1930 and 1940.|$|E

25|$|Tea was {{introduced}} into India by the British {{in an attempt}} to break the Chinese monopoly on tea. In 1841, Archibald Campbell brought seeds of Chinese tea from the Kumaun region and experimented with planting tea in Darjeeling. The Alubari tea garden was opened in 1856 and Darjeeling tea began to be produced. In 1848, Robert Fortune was sent by the East India Company on a mission to China to bring the tea plant back to Great Britain. He began his journey in high secrecy as his mission occurred in the lull between the Anglo-Chinese First Opium War (18391842) and Second Opium War (18561860). The Chinese tea plants he brought back were introduced to the Himalayas, though most did not survive. The British had discovered that a different variety of tea was endemic to Assam and the northeast region of India and that it was used by the local Singpho people, and these were then grown instead of the Chinese tea plant. Using the Chinese planting and <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques,</b> the British launched a tea industry by offering land in Assam to any European who agreed to cultivate it for export. Tea was originally consumed only by anglicized Indians; however, it became widely popular in India in the 1950s because of a successful advertising campaign by the India Tea Board.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is often}} claimed by growers and breeders of herbal {{cannabis}} that advances in breeding and <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques</b> {{have increased the}} potency of cannabis since the late 1960s and early '70s when THC was first discovered and understood. However, potent seedless cannabis such as [...] "Thai sticks" [...] were already available at that time. Sinsemilla (Spanish for [...] "without seed") is the dried, seedless inflorescences of female cannabis plants. Because THC production drops off once pollination occurs, the male plants (which produce little THC themselves) are eliminated before they shed pollen to prevent pollination. Advanced <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques</b> such as hydroponics, cloning, high-intensity artificial lighting, and the sea of green method are frequently employed as a response (in part) to prohibition enforcement efforts that make outdoor cultivation more risky. It is often cited that the average levels of THC in cannabis sold in the United States rose dramatically between the 1970s and 2000, but such statements are likely skewed because undue weight is given to much more expensive and potent, but less prevalent samples.|$|E

2500|$|The {{forest of}} Skule {{has always been}} a {{topographic}} barrier. For example, it would have perhaps have been the northern frontier of the kingdom of Svealand before the year 1000, and thus the border between adjacent municipalities and parishes. The villages it separated had very limited contact with each other and, because of the poor agricultural potential of the forest, there was never a permanent settlement in the forest. The forest was, however, traversed by a trail, which later took the name of Kustlandsvägen and which corresponded roughly to the path of today's European route E4. For a long time, this path constituted the only road {{to the north of the}} country. The zone was thus the property of the Swedish crown, which could decide who could use the forest as pasture or engage in logging there. In the 17th century, unlike many of the northern Swedish forests belonging to the crown, Skuleskogen did not see any colonization by the Forest Finns (...) , and thus did not undergo slash-and-burn <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques.</b> The forest was instead used as a summer pasture (transhumance), and the hay of the marshes was used as well, although in a very localized fashion. As a result, in today's national park there were four summer pasture cottages, three having existed up until the turn of the 20th century, while the last (Näskebodarna) remained active up until the end of World War II. This last is now used, maintained in its old state, for tourism. The forest would seem to be more open in those days than now.|$|E

Thus, {{the objective of this}} research was to evaluate, in off-season cultivation, the forage and grains production in off-season by interrow intercropping of grain sorghum with brachiaria in two sowing depths. The experiment was carried out in field in Rio Verde-GO, on March 5, 2009. The experimental design used was the randomized blocks in factorial scheme 2 x 3 + 1 + 3 with four replications, corresponding to two brachiaria sowing depths (2 and 10 cm), three brachiaria species (Brachiaria decumbens, B. brizantha cv. Marandú and B. ruziziensis) and four additional treatments of sorghum and three brachiaria species (monocultures). The grain sorghum used was the DKB 599. The evaluation of the brachiaria forage yield was made up at 98 days after the sorghum harvest. The interrow intercropping of sorghum with Brachiaria ruziziensis, regardless the sowing depth, and with B. brizantha, sowed in 2 cm depth, did not cause reductions in grain yield. The interrow intercropping with brachiaria possible increases in dry matter and crude protein total yields of the forage.
