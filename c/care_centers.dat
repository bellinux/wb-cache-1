5|$|Blue's Clues {{was set in}} the home—the {{environment}} that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers—and looked like no other children's television show. Each episode was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed {{and approved by the}} show's creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, day <b>care</b> <b>centers,</b> preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate the story {{in the form of a}} storybook and take notes about the children's responses. The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.|$|E

5|$|Traditional {{values have}} endured the attempt by western {{institutions}} {{to impose a}} positive image of deviant behavior. For instance, {{in spite of the}} removal of homosexuality from the nomenclature of mental disorders, 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the Rostov Region view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior. The psychiatrists sustain the ban on gay parades and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools, child <b>care</b> <b>centers,</b> and other public institutions. The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to Dozhd says that a part of the cases of homosexuality is a mental disorder, he counters the remark that the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true. Homosexuality, which is a mental disorder, was continuously defined as such by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to antipsychiatric actions, and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one. In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality, and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality.|$|E

40|$|Background: These {{two studies}} {{examined}} whether facial expressions in student identification photographs were connected with health <b>care</b> <b>center</b> visitation. Method: In Study 1, participants (N = 267) completed a short online survey that detailed {{the number of}} times they had visited a health <b>care</b> <b>center</b> in the last year. In Study 2, participants (N = 435) answered this same question, but health <b>care</b> <b>center</b> visits were divided into four categories: illness, injury, mood-related, and preventive. In both studies, the photographs on participants’ student identification cards were coded as no smile, non-Duchenne smile, or Duchenne smile. Results: Logistic regressions revealed that in Study 1, participants with non-Duchenne or Duchenne smiles {{were more likely to have}} visited a health <b>care</b> <b>center</b> in the past year than participants with no smile in their photograph. However, Study 2 revealed that this finding was driven by preventive health <b>care</b> <b>center</b> visits: participants with non-Duchenne or Duchenne smiles in their photographs were more likely to have visited a health <b>care</b> <b>center</b> in the past year for preventive purposes than participants with no smile in their photograph. No facial expression differences were found for health <b>care</b> <b>center</b> visits for illness, injury, or mood-related concerns. Conclusions: Smiling in photographs is connected to preventive health <b>care</b> <b>center</b> visits, a positive health behavior. Future research should continue to investigate whether smiles in photographs are connected with other important health outcome...|$|R
