In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the microstructure and mechanical properties of <b>cross</b> <b>roll</b> rolled Ni- 30 Cr alloy, comparing with conventionally rolled material, this work was carried out. The materials were cold rolled to 90 % in thickness reduction by conventional rolling and <b>cross</b> <b>roll</b> rolling methods and subsequently annealed at 700 ℃ for 30 min. After this work, in order {{to evaluate the}} grain boundary character distributions of the materials, electron back-scattered diffraction technique was introduced. The application of <b>cross</b> <b>roll</b> rolling was more effective to develop the microstructure and mechanical properties than those of conventional rolling. As a result, the grain size was significantly refined to 1. 3 µm in conventional rolling and 0. 6 µm in <b>cross</b> <b>roll</b> rolling, compared to initial material (30 µm), respectively. Also, these grain refinements directly affected an increase in mechanical properties.

40|$|The {{effect of}} strain path change during rolling has been {{investigated}} for copper and nickel using X-ray diffraction and electron back scatter diffraction as well as crystal plasticity simulations. Four different strain paths namely: (i) unidirectional rolling; (ii) reverse rolling; (iii) two-step cross rolling and (iv) multi-step cross rolling were employed to decipher the effect of strain path change {{on the evolution of}} deformation texture and microstructure. The <b>cross</b> <b>rolled</b> samples showed weaker texture with a prominent Bs { 1 1 0 } and P(B(ND)) { 1 1 0 } component in contrast to the unidirectional and reverse rolled samples where strong S { 1 2 3 } and Cu { 1 1 2 } components were formed. This was more pronounced for copper samples compared to nickel. The <b>cross</b> <b>rolled</b> samples were characterized by lower anisotropy and Taylor factor as well as less variation in Lankford parameter.

The time period of the cross-roll patterns diverges, and shows scaling behavior near the bifurcation point.

40|$|Spontaneous {{transitions}} between non-equilibrium {{patterns are}} characterised by hydrodynamic calculations of ideal straight roll steady state heat convection. The calculations are tested quantitatively against existing experimental data. It is shown {{that at a}} given Rayleigh number the final wave number depends upon whether the initial state was the conducting state, or, {{in the case of}} the <b>cross</b> <b>roll</b> transition, the wave number of the initial straight roll state. The final wave number does not correspond to the maximum or to the minimum heat flux (entropy production or dissipation), nor to the maximum sub-system entropy. In all cases the entropy of the total system increases monotonically during the spontaneous transition. It is concluded that there does not exist any single time thermodynamic property or variational principle for non-equilibrium systems. It is further concluded that the second entropy is the two time variational principle that determines the optimum non-equilibrium state or pattern. Comment: 25 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|A {{process chain}} for {{manufacturing}} of machine parts in general consists of several process steps, e. g. continuous casting, hot rolling, annealing, pre straightening, cold drawing, straightening and polishing, machining, induction hardening, and grinding. Distortion is frequently observed {{after the final}} heat treatment process. However not only the hardening process, but also {{the history of the}} manufacturing chain is responsible. In the present work several essential manufacturing steps of a process chain were investigated experimentally and the distribution of the residual stresses as an important carrier of distortion potential was analyzed by means of non destructive neutron diffraction over the whole cross section of the shafts. The results showed nonsymmetrical residual stress distribution along the cross section after the pre straightening of the uncoiled wire. The cold drawing created high tensile residual stresses at the surface in radial and tangential directions, while much higher compressive stresses were found, particularly in axial direction, in the core. The residual stresses of the drawn shaft were reduced largely by a following <b>cross</b> <b>roll</b> straightening. The final induction hardening changed the residual stress state again largely in dependence on the process parameters. The influences of the investigated manufacturing steps on the residual stress states are finally discussed in connection with the resulting distortion...|$|E
40|$|Seamless tube {{manufacturing}} utilises {{continuous cast}} cylindrical billets that, after piercing, are rolled until specified diameter, thickness and length are reached. The hollow part can be industrially obtained through <b>cross</b> <b>roll</b> piercing, being the main characteristic {{of this process}} the occurrence of a local failure at the billet centre due to the so-called Mannesmann Effect. The knowledge of those industrial parameters, which determine the start and the propagation of the axial fracture, is crucial because they determine the optimal position of the plug in order to grant both the best quality of the tube and the plug service life. The objective {{of the work is}} to develop a reliable numerical model capable to describe the industrial conditions that lead to Mannesmann fracture through the implementation into a commercial FE code of a coupled damage law based on Continuum Damage Mechanics. The fracture characterization utilises a damage model according to the Lemaitre formulation and the damage parameters identification is based on inverse analysis on hot tensile test results. In particular, a modification to the Lemaitre damage law is adopted in order to describe the different behaviour of the material in the billet section and {{to take into account the}} effect of porosity and phase distribution on the initial damage. Finally, the developed model is validated, through the comparison between numerical results and industrial trials of a non-plug piercing operation, showing that there is a good agreement for what concern the length and the initiation site of the Mannesmann cone fracture...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} resonant temporal forcing on an anisotropic system that exhibits a Hopf bifurcation to obliquely traveling waves {{in the absence of}} this forcing. We find that the forcing can excite various phase-locked standing-wave structures: <b>rolls,</b> rectangles and <b>cross</b> <b>rolls.</b> At onset, at most one of the two - rolls or rectangles - is stable. The <b>cross</b> <b>rolls</b> can arise in a secondary bifurcation and can be stable. Experimentally, they would appear as a periodic switching between a structure in which the `zig'-component dominates and one with dominating `zag'-structure. Since there are two symmetry-related states of this kind one may expect disordered structures to arise due to the break-up of the pattern into domains. The results are consistent with recent experiments on electro-convection in nematic liquid crystals by de la Torre and Rehberg. We also apply the general analysis to a model of the behavior near a Lifshitz point, where the angle of obliqueness vanishes. This analysis indicates that phase-locked standing rectangles are always unstable in this parameter regime. Comment: 36 pages (Revtex 3), 12 figures (postscript...|$|R

40|$|Convection in a {{fluid layer}} is {{affected}} by its orientation {{with respect to the}} gravitational field. In the present work, we investigate numerically pattern selection in a vertical cylindrical cell heated from below for positive Soret coefficient mixtures and analyse the effect of marginal inclinations of gravity in pattern formation. The dynamics of mixtures with a positive value of the Soret coefficient without inclination has essentially been studied in laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations reduce to periodic domains. According to these studies, close to convective onset, the motion is dominated by the solute gradient, and a stationary square pattern with negligible change in heat transport is reached (Soret regime). Far from threshold, convection selects the usual roll structure observed in pure fluid convection, where a strong change in heat transport takes place. In the crossover region, a <b>cross</b> <b>roll</b> regime is observed and the competition between square and roll patterns leads to oscillations. Interestingly, positive Soret coefficient mixtures have been used in the recent experimental work of Croccolo et al. to investigate the effect of inclination of the layer on the long-term stability. At small Rayleigh numbers, the mass transfer is dominated by the induced large scale shear flow, while at larger Rayleigh numbers, it is dominated by solutal convection. Unexpected results are reported at the transition: drifting columnar flows moving in opposite directions along parallel lanes in a superhighway configuration have been observed. We will present simulations corresponding to both non-inclined and inclined cells. In particular, {{we have been able to}} obtain numerically superhighway convection (SHC). The numerical analysis should shed some light on the origin of these fast drifting columnar flows observed in experiments. Postprint (author's final draft...|$|E
