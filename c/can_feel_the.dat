5|$|Yellowfang's Secret was {{released}} on 9 October 2012. It is a Super Edition about the former medicine cat of ThunderClan, Yellowfang and her life in ShadowClan. It follows Yellowfang as she first trains to be a warrior, then a medicine cat, as Sagewhisker tells her that her paws are not meant for shedding blood. She decides to switch {{to the role of}} medicine cat instead because she <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> injuries of all the other cats in ShadowClan. A few moons later she breaks the code of medicine cats when she gives birth to kits; as a result, she and her whole Clan are punished for her disloyalty to the code, as her only surviving kit, Brokenkit proves to be vicious, bloodthirsty, and driven only by ambition, qualities that his own father, Raggedstar, ignores. In the end, Yellowfang herself is cast out of ShadowClan to live as a rogue by her own kit, now having gone on to follow in his father's footsteps and become Brokenstar for a crime she did not commit.|$|E

However, water from ordinary sources (including bottled mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances, that may give it varying tastes and odors. Humans and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the potability of water by avoiding water that is too salty or putrid.|$|E

25|$|Hand {{signals are}} {{a form of}} sign system used by divers to {{communicate}} when underwater. Hand signals are useful whenever divers can see each other, and some {{can also be used}} in poor visibility if in close proximity, when the recipient <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> shape of the signaller's hand and thereby identify the signal being given. At night the signal can be illuminated by the diver's light. Hand signals are the primary method of underwater communication for recreational scuba divers, and are also in general use by professional divers, usually as a secondary method.|$|E
25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. We played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now. When playing those songs, I thought, 'Here's a person {{at the time that}} I don't relate to anymore.' He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot of}} other personal stuff that I won't get into.

[...] Rediff called his performance [...] "excellent", and [...] "...one of the top performances of 2007".

[...] Lon Grahnke from the Chicago Sun-Times thought the show would be a [...] "probable hit" [...] based on the [...] "Pilot". He also observed that the show is [...] "a Cleveland variation of Friends, and thought the early time slot was a turn off, as it required the language to be toned-down.

Olivier was interviewed during the film's production and explained why he agreed {{to be part of}} its cast: [...] "People ask me why I'm playing in this picture. The answer is simple. Money, dear boy. I'm like a vintage wine. You have to drink me quickly before I turn sour. I'm almost used up now and I <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> end coming. That's why I'm taking money now.

500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics.

The Thavil beats, Nadaswara refrains and the honeyed voice all blend into an inviting melody composed by K.V. Mahadevan." [...] For [...] "Maraindhirundhu" [...] she said, [...] "The nadaswaram and thavil back-ups for this song and the jathi-s give it its typical classical flavour. 'Thooyane mayavaa mayane velava ennai aalum Shanmuga vaa'– these lines represent the ideal confluence of raga, bhava and lyric, a perfect foil to each other." [...] Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen in their Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, referred to [...] "Nalandhana" [...] as [...] " [...] major song hit".

500|$|The opening {{number of}} the show {{received}} the most disparate reviews from critics.

[...] He was also pleased that Rory was given solo lines, and Sugar was [...] "being embraced as a part of the group". Lynch thought that [...] "Amber Riley and Chord Overstreet harmonize surprisingly wonderfully", and gave this [...] "easily the most fun {{number of the}} episode" [...] an [...] "A−". Stanhope said that [...] "the energy is infectious and you <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> sparks between the former pair", but the performance was [...] "way too much of a copycat" [...] of the original Grease scene, while Flandez said that the two leads [...] "lacked chemistry" [...] and that the number was [...] "inexplicable". VanDerWerff was similarly unimpressed: [...] "dumb and unnecessary". Chaney wrote that the number [...] "was a high-energy, cute way for the show to mark its comeback", but said that Rory [...] "sounded flat" [...] on one of his lines, and Sam [...] "couldn’t quite hit" [...] the ending high note in the song, and graded it a [...] "B".|$|E

Misemer {{wrote in}} her book Secular saints: {{performing}} Frida Kahlo, Carlos Gardel, Eva Perón, and Selena that Live! and Amor Prohibido (1994) were the two most successful albums of Selena's career. Joey Guerra of Amazon.com wrote that Live! is a [...] "sizzling reminder of [...] electric stage charisma and blossoming talent as a performer". Guerra also stated that the songs performed live had showcased Selena's [...] "uncanny ability to infuse a love song with both girlish innocence and a heated sexuality".

He also states that any listener <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> [...] "heat seeping through your speakers". Guerra ended his review stating that Live!

500|$|According to {{the digital}} sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, {{the song is}} composed in the key of B major and set in common time signature, with it having a dance pop tempo of 110 beats per minute. Lo's vocals span from the low note of B3 to the high note of C5. The song has a minimal and upbeat electronic instrumentation which consists of drums, bass, backup vocals and Lo's voice. The song starts with the words [...] "oh oh", which repeat after every sentence of the verses. The chorus contains the millennial whoop, a vocal melody repeating on the fifth and third notes in a major scale. Some critics noted a contrast between the track's lyrics and production. Carrie Battan of Pitchfork stated that the song [...] "contrasts a giant hook and chorus with snappy verses filled with quietly distinct, often strange imagery: of [...] eating her dinner in the bathtub, getting drunken munchies, seducing dads on playgrounds". Chris Jordan of Asbury Park Press described [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] as a [...] "synth-based pop song with a sweeping chorus", but noted that the lyrical content of the track {{was similar to that}} of rock 'n' roll music. The singer herself stated that: [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> lyrics and the dark and sad but if you combine it with, brings a little to the dark humor as well. I like the thing of dancing along and then listening to what I'm actually saying." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Only One" [...] was {{originally}} called [...] "Tuna Afternoon" [...] and lyrically delves on Lee's experiences with close-mindedness and {{people around her}} who seemed lost {{in a world in}} which they did not belong. It starts with a piano introduction similar to that of the band's Fallen era and songs by Sarah McLachlan. In the song, Lee [...] "decries human guidance" [...] with the chorus lines, [...] "All our lives / We've been waiting / For someone to call our leader / All your lies / I'm not believing / Heaven shine a light down on me". [...] "Your Star" [...] was motivated by Lee's loneliness during the band's tour in support of Fallen. She was inspired to write the chorus in Lisbon when she looked at the night sky and could see no stars. Other inspiration came from the works of [...] Pantera. Guitars and piano provide the track's instrumentation; while Lee sings about God according to Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone. [...] "All That I'm Living For" [...] was co-written by guitarist John LeCompt; it describes Lee's night-time writing process, which is showcased in the opening line, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> night beginning / Separate me from the living". It contains [...] "power chords", elements of electronica, and abrasive guitars. [...] "Good Enough" [...] was solely written by Lee, and was placed at the end of the album for symbolizing its themes and those of the singer's life. While featuring a string section, it resembles Tori Amos' and Sarah McLachlan's songs. Inspired by her then-future husband Josh Hartzler, [...] "Good Enough" [...] has a similar composition to [...] "My Immortal" [...] because of their piano sounds.|$|E
