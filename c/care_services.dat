40|$|Purpose Service {{ecosystems}} are gaining credence among management scholars. However, {{there is still}} little agreement about the distinguishing attributes of service ecosystems in {{both the public and}} the private sectors. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to focus on the health <b>care</b> <b>service</b> system, suggesting a “recipe” for the implementation of a sustainable and innovative health <b>care</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem. Design/methodology/approach A mixed methodology was used. First, a critical literature review was conducted to lay the conceptual foundations of this study. Then a theory about the institutional, organizational and managerial requisites for the implementation of a health <b>care</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem was developed. Findings The health care sector is appropriate for the core tenets of the service ecosystem perspective. Tailored interventions aimed at improving the functioning of the health <b>care</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem should be implemented at the micro, meso, macro and mega levels. Patient empowerment, patient-centered care and integrated care are the fundamental ingredients of the recipe for effective health <b>care</b> <b>service</b> ecosystems. Practical implications The ecosystem approach provides health policy makers with interesting insights to help shape the health <b>care</b> <b>service</b> system of the future. The paper also contributes to the innovation of managerial practices emphasizing the role of patient involvement in the design and delivery of health care. Originality/value This is one of the first attempts to systematize scientific knowledge about service ecosystems in the health care sector. An agenda for further research is suggested, in order to further advance the establishment of an effective and innovative health <b>care</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem...|$|R

Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} was opened in 1933 by the U.S. {{government as a}} United States Marine Hospital Service hospital. Replacing a facility in Port Townsend, it opened with 312 beds in 1933. The hospital originally served veterans, merchant seamen, the US Coast Guard, the US Lighthouse Service, and poor and indigent people defined as “federal compensation cases”. In 1951, it was re-designated as a US Public Health Service facility along with all other Marine hospitals. In 1953, a three-story annex was constructed on {{the east end of}} the building to serve outpatient clinics. Two stair towers were added to the south face in 1975. The building continued to grow in 1980 as a laboratory and primary care addition were built. The federal government ceased operation of the facility and other similar hospitals in 1981. Control was shifted to Seattle, and the city chartered the Pacific Hospital Preservation and Development Authority(PHPDA). The PHPDA owns the property and uses long-term tenants with leases.

40|$|Background : The goal of {{maternal}} and antenatal care is to strengthen to improve access and to omprove maternal {{and child health}} status effectively and efficiency. One of indicators to evaluate the program at health center level is the coverage of pregnant mothers who seek theservice (K 4). The antenatal <b>care</b> <b>service</b> is provided free of charge for underprevilege families at community health centers, village midwives and village health posts under social security community health service. However, the coverage of pregnant mothers who seek the service(K 4) for underprevilege families at Sulang is still under target as recorded on 2005. The coverage of this community health center was still reach 39, 6 %. This condition could be assumed that the utility of antenatal care servese is not at optimum level. The preference of antenatal careservice is a form of behavior in health. This research aims to know the association between demographic factors, maternal knowledge and antenatal <b>care</b> <b>service</b> preference amongst underprevilege families at Sulang Community Health Center, Rembang Regency. Method : This study utilized explanatory survey. The respondents are 35 mothers from underprevilege famil ies who prefer to use the designated antenatal <b>care</b> <b>service</b> base on recommendation by local government and 40 mothers from underprevilege families who prefer to use the others on 2005. Proportionate random sampling was utilized based on randomnumber table. Data was analyzed using Chi-square test. Result : Results showed there was a significant association between age and antenatal <b>care</b> <b>service</b> preference (p-value= 0, 001), a significant association between educational attainment and antenatal <b>care</b> <b>service</b> preference (p-value= 0, 007), a significant association between parity and antenatal <b>care</b> <b>service</b> preference (p-value= 0, 003).
