40|$|The wear {{behaviour}} of a SiAlON and a SiC whisker reinforced Al 2 O 3 composite in {{dry sliding}} contact against Inconel 718 was investigated. For tribological characterization, the worn contact surfaces were analysed using tribometer data and calculation of wear volume {{in addition to}} SEM/EDX analysis. The surface <b>contact</b> <b>temperatures</b> were estimated by finite element simulations. The tribological behaviour is distinct for each ceramic. The wear in SiAlON undergoes an exponential decay with increasing frictional power due {{to the formation of}} lubricous tribolayers that separate both contacting surfaces; once the frictional power is high enough tribochemical wear dominates and delamination of the tribolayers takes place. The wear of Al 2 O 3 -SiC is lower than that of SiAlON especially at high frictional power, which can be mainly attributed to the chemical stability of the alumina matrix and the formation of stable lubricous tribolayers.

50|$|The {{activity}} of halogenated hydrocarbons increases with decreasing {{stability of the}} carbon-halogen bond. At local contact temperatures ranging between 305-330 °C, the additive thermally decomposes and the reactive halogen atoms form a surface layer of iron halides on the part surface. Eventual failure of the contact point comes when the <b>contact</b> <b>temperature</b> exceeds the melting point of the iron halide layer. Under such conditions, small particles of carbon are generated as well. Some compounds used in lubricant additives are chloroalkanes, trichloromethyl phosphine acids, organic esters of a-acetoxy-b,b,b-trichloroethyl phosphonic acid, trichloromethyl esters of phosphoric acid, trichloromethyl derivates of sulfur, trichloroacetoxy compounds, esters or amine salts of chlorendic acid, 1,2,3,4,7,7-hexachloro-5-dimethylbicyclo2.2.1-2-heptene, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The {{assessment}} of the clinker peak temperature has always been problematic. <b>Contact</b> <b>temperature</b> measurement is impossible because of the chemically aggressive and abrasive nature of the hot clinker, and optical methods such as infrared pyrometry are difficult because of the dust and fume-laden atmosphere in the burning zone. The traditional method of assessment was to view the bed of clinker and deduce the amount of liquid formation by experience. As more liquid forms, the clinker becomes stickier, and the bed of material climbs higher up the rising side of the kiln. It is usually also possible to assess {{the length of the}} zone of liquid formation, beyond which powdery [...] "fresh" [...] feed can be seen. Cameras, with or without infrared measurement capability, are mounted on the kiln hood to facilitate this. On many kilns, the same information can be inferred from the kiln motor power drawn, since sticky feed riding high on the kiln wall increases the eccentric turning load of the kiln. Further information can be obtained from the exhaust gas analyzers. The formation of NO from nitrogen and oxygen takes place only at high temperatures, and so the NO level gives an indication of the combined feed and flame temperature. SO2 is formed by thermal decomposition of calcium sulfate in the clinker, and so also gives in indication of clinker temperature. Modern computer control systems usually make a [...] "calculated" [...] temperature, using contributions from all these information sources, and then set about controlling it.|$|E
40|$|Evapotranspiration models require {{thermodynamic}} temperatures as a {{state variable}} characterizing the surface energy balance. The thermodynamic temperature is calculated using the brightness temperature and the emissivity because no effective method exists to measure thermodynamic temperatures in space and time. A method was therefore developed to measure thermodynamic temperatures in time using contact probes and spatial variations of the thermodynamic temperature using a thermal camera. Using an extraction scheme, the brightness temperatures of canopy and soil were extracted from the thermal images and compared with the <b>contact</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The <b>contact</b> <b>temperatures</b> had similar amplitudes and time-variability as the brightness temperatures for both components. The slope and offset parameters of a scatter plot were calculated. The slope of the scatter plot was lower than unity for canopy, and higher than unity for soil. Because of the spread in the scatter plot, the emissivities of the components could not be calculated. We conclude that kinematic <b>temperature</b> measurements by <b>contact</b> probes can be a valuable extension to current techniques for measuring continuous component temperatures. The extraction scheme could be {{a useful tool for}} extracting the component brightness temperatures for low-resolution imagery...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 83 - 90). The need for technological progression {{in the field of}} electronics has been persistently escalating. So far silicon has been the most important fabrication material of preference for meeting the current demands. However, silicon itself has few of its own limitations; Silicon based integrated circuits and the scaling of silicon MOSFET design faces complications like tunneling effect, gate oxide thickness effect etc. which has given the extensive perimeter for new materials with improved characteristics to emerge. In up to date periods, graphene and carbon nanotube have shown huge promise as materials that can swap silicon-based materials in the future due to their outstanding electrical properties and other characteristics. Simulation studies of graphene nanoribbon field-effect transistors (GNRFETs) and carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs) at different <b>contact</b> <b>temperatures</b> are presented in this thesis paper using models that have been methodically developed and are of increasing thoroughness and versatility. This thesis covers the studies and modeling of graphene nanoribbon and carbon nanotube, which includes band structures and current-voltage graphical plots. Also, an analysis has been presented which shows the effect by varying <b>contact</b> <b>temperatures</b> for relative dielectric constant and chirality on the device performance, in particular on the drain current. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to the study behaviour of graphene nanoribbon transistors and carbon nanotube transistors. The simulation is carried out using NanoTCAD ViDES program and the main focus is on the changes in the I-V characteristic curves for transfer and output characteristics for relative dielectric constant and chirality for different <b>contact</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The obtained results were used to make a comparative analysis of the device performance of GNRFET and CNTFET. We confirmed our work by contrasting of our results with other recognized academic papers published under the same category. Md. Reaz Haider PavelMd. Zishan Ibne HussainA. B. M. Rakibul AhsanB.

40|$|The {{operating}} {{conditions under which}} chemical reactions between diamond-like-carbon (DLC) coatings and oil additives occur and the main driving forces, i. e., the activation criteria for these chemical reactions, {{have not yet been}} defined. In order to clarify the difference between the test temperature and real <b>contact</b> <b>temperature,</b> and to determine the effect of the real <b>contact</b> <b>temperature</b> for these reactions, we have calculated the contact temperatures using two well-known models and compare them with results of tribological experiments and some state-of-the-art analyses of wornsurfaces. The results suggest that the actual surface temperatures are 100 - 130 °C higher than the test temperatures. A <b>contact</b> <b>temperature</b> of about 250 - 260 °C was found to be the required key activation criterion for chemical reactions between the dialkyl dithiophosphate extreme-pressure (EP) additive and the DLC coating. Gradual formation of a tribochemical protective film from phosphates and organic sulphur/sulphates suggests a lower chemical reactivity and slower formation of the optimal tribochemical protective layer on DLC coatings than on steels. No tribological effect of anti-wear (AW) or EP additives could be found on the DLC coatings when the surface temperatures were below 120 - 140 °C. The temperature-induced graphitisation of the DLC that occurred in the contacts with the base oils, however, require about 250 °C of <b>contact</b> <b>temperature.</b> Lower surface temperatures or the use of additives suppressed this graphitisation...|$|E
