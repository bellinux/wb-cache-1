50|$|Micronuclei {{formation}} {{may also}} result from <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> during anaphase. Hypomethylation of cytosine in centromeric and pericentromeric areas and higher-order repeats of satellite DNA in centromeric DNA {{can result in}} such chromosomal loss events. Classical satellite DNA is normally heavily methylated at cytosine residues but may become almost fully unmethylated due to ICF syndrome (Immunodeficiency, centromere instability, and facial anomalies syndrome) or after treatment by DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. Since assembly of kinetochore proteins at centromeres {{is affected by the}} methylation of cytosine and histone proteins, a reduction in heterochromatin integrity as a result of hypomethylation can interfere with microtubule attachment to chromosomes and with the sensing of tension from correct microtubule-kinetochore connections. Other possible causes of chromosome loss that could lead to micronuclei formation are defects in kinetochore and microtubule interactions, defects in mitotic spindle assembly, mitosis check point defects, abnormal centrosome amplification, and telomeric end fusions that result in dicentric chromosomes that detach from the spindle during anaphase. Micronuclei originating from chromosome loss events and acentric chromosome fragments can be distinguished using pancentromeric DNA probes.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) {{is associated}} with insulin resistance and reproductive and metabolic abnormalities. The potential genetic contributors to PCOS are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that genomic instability (<b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> and DNA damage) is increased in PCOS. METHODS: Overweight age, weight and BMI-matched women with (n= 14) and without (n= 16) PCOS (age 34. 2 +/- 6. 0 years, weight 90. 7 +/- 14. 5 kg, BMI 34. 0 +/- 5. 6 kg/m(2), mean+/-S. D.) were assessed for <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> (assessed by X chromosome chromogenic in situ hybridisation) and micronucleus frequency (assessed by the cytokinesis block micronucleus index) in lymphocytes. RESULTS: Women with PCOS had significantly elevated genomic instability as demonstrated by a significantly higher number of binucleated lymphocytes containing micronuclei, total number of micronuclei, {{a higher proportion of}} aneuploid X chromosome signals (2 : 1 X and 3 : 1 X) and a lower proportion of normal X chromosome segregation signals (2 : 2 X) in binucleated lymphocytes than women without PCOS. Surrogate measures of insulin resistance positively correlated with the proportion of aneuploid cells (2 : 1; 3 : 1 X chromosome signals) and inversely with the proportion of normal cells (2 : 2 X chromosome signals). CONCLUSION: Women with PCOS display increased genomic instability (higher micronuclei and <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation)</b> compared to women without PCOS and this increase {{may be related to the}} insulin resistance phenotype.

40|$|Micronuclei (MNi) can {{originate}} {{either from}} chromosome breakage or <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> events {{and are therefore}} ideal biomarkers to investigate genomic instability. Studies in peripheral lymphocytes of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, mainly Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), revealed an increased micronucleus (MN) frequency in both disorders but originating mainly from <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> events in AD and from chromosome breakage events in PD. Studies in other neurodegenerative diseases are largely missing, and some data in premature ageing disorders characterised by neurodegeneration and/or neurological complications, such as Ataxia telangiectasia, Werner’s syndrome, Down’s syndrome (DS) and Cockayne’s syndrome, indicate that MNi increase with ageing in cultured cells. An increased frequency of aneuploidy characterises several tissues of AD patients, {{as well as of}} individuals at increased risk to develop AD, such as mothers of DS individuals and DS subjects themselves. The use of the buccal MN cytome assay in AD and DS subjects allowed finding significant changes in the MN frequency as well as other cellular modifications reflecting reduced regenerative capacity compared to age- and gender-matched controls. These changes in buccal cytome ratios may prove useful as potential future diagnostics to identify individuals of increased risk for these disorder...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{observation}} of increased oxidative DNA damage in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA extracted from post-mortem brain regions of patients affected by neurodegenerative diseases, {{the last years of}} the previous century and {{the first decade of the}} present one have been largely dedicated to the search of markers of DNA damage in neuronal samples and peripheral tissues of patients in early, intermediate or late stages of neurodegeneration. Those studies allowed to demonstrate that oxidative DNA damage is one of the earliest detectable events in neurodegeneration, but also revealed cytogenetic damage in neurodegenerative conditions, such as for example a tendency towards <b>chromosome</b> 21 <b>malsegregation</b> in Alzheimer's disease. As it happens for many neurodegenerative risk factors the question of whether DNA damage is cause or consequence of the neurodegenerative process is still open, and probably both is true. The research interest in markers of oxidative stress was shifted, in recent years, towards the search of epigenetic biomarkers of neurodegenerative disorders, following the accumulating evidence of a substantial contribution of epigenetic mechanisms to learning, memory processes, behavioural disorders and neurodegeneration. Increasing evidence is however linking DNA damage and repair with epigenetic phenomena, thereby opening the way to a very attractive and timely research topic in neurodegenerative diseases. We will address those issues in the context of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, which represent three of the most common neurodegenerative pathologies in humans...|$|R
40|$|Rapamycin induces <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> in {{mammalian}} cell lines and yeast. Previous {{studies indicate that}} the function impaired in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients is necessary for both the growth inhibition and the <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> induced by rapamycin, and that treating the non-tumorigenic Chinese hamster cell line CHEF/ 18 with rapamycin results in supernumerary centrosomes and multipolar spindles. In this paper we report that lymphoblastoid cell lines established from A-T patients as well as hamster A-T-like cells are more resistant to rapamycin than the respective normal cell lines. Two cell lines derived from Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) patients, who have clinical symptoms {{similar to those of}} A-T but a different molecular defect, were not resistant to raparrycin. Both A-T lymphoblastoid cells and A-T-like fibroblasts had giant centrosomes formed by more than two areas of gamma-tubulin-reacting material. Such giant centrosomes were also observed in CHEF/ 18 cells after prolonged treatment with rapamycin. Formation of giant centrosomes, possibly due to the coalescence of supernumerary centrosomes, was associated with increased aneuploicly in treated cells. Expression analysis of cell-cycle regulatory genes in rapamycin-treated human lymphoblastoid cells indicated that rapamycin decreased the expression of the tumor suppressor gene GADD 45. The levels of RB, p 21 and p 53 mRNA were also decreased, although to a lesser extent. As raparrycin is often used as an immunosuppressant in pediatric transplant patients, these data indicate that caution should be taken, especially when the drug is given for prolonged periods of time...|$|E
40|$|Aneuploidy plays a {{major role}} in the {{production}} of human birth defects and is becoming increasingly recognised as a critical event in the etiology of a wide range of human cancers. Thus, the detection of aneuploidy and the characterisation of the mechanisms which lead to <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> is an important area of genotoxicological research. As an aid to aneuploidy research, methods have been developed to analyse the mechanisms of <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> and to investigate the role of aneuploidy in tumour progression. The presence of aneuploid cells is a common characteristic of many of tumour cell types as illustrated by the wide range of chromosome number changes detected in post-menopausal breast tumours. To investigate the time of occurrence of aneuploidy during tumour progression, we have studied the chromosome number status of Syrian hamster dermal (SHD) cells cultures progressing to morphological transformation. The production of both polyploid and aneuploid cells is a common feature of progressing cells in this model. The elevation of both progression to morphological transformation and aneuploid frequencies can be produced by exposure to a diverse range of carcinogens and tumour promoters. Analysis of the genotoxic activity of the hormone 17 -beta oestradiol demonstrated its ability to induce both chromosome loss and non-disjunction in human lymphoblastoid cells implicating aneugenic activity in hormone related cancers. Mutations in the p 53 tumour suppressor gene introduced into human fibroblasts produced modifications in chromosome separation at mitosis which may lead to the production of both aneuploidy and polyploid cells. Our studies indicate that the production of aneuploid cells can be influenced by both endogenous and exogenous factors and occur throughout the progression of normal cells to a malignant phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Parthenogenetic cells, {{obtained}} from in vitro activated mammalian oocytes, display multipolar spindles, <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> {{and a high}} incidence of aneuploidy, probably {{due to the lack of}} paternal contribution. Despite this, parthenogenetic cells do not show high rates of apoptosis and are able to proliferate in a way comparable to their biparental counterpart. We hypothesize that a series of adaptive mechanisms are present in parthenogenetic cells, allowing a continuous proliferation and ordinate cell differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Here we identify the presence of intercellular bridges that contribute to the establishment of a wide communication network among human parthenogenetic cells, providing a mutual exchange of missing products. Silencing of two molecules essential for intercellular bridge formation and maintenance demonstrates the key function played by these cytoplasmic passageways that ensure normal cell functions and survival, alleviating the unbalance in cellular component composition...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE:Spontaneous parthenogenetically {{activated}} noninseminated oocytes {{and failed}} fertilized oocytes after ART activated by puromycin were studied to assess cleavage ability and the cytogenetic {{constitution of the}} resulting embryos. METHODS: Failed fertilized oocytes were exposed to puromycin, and whenever activation occurred, they were further cultured until arrest of development. FISH {{was used to assess}} the ploidy of spontaneous (group A) and induced parthenotes (group B). RESULTS: The mean number of oocytes exposed to puromycin and the percentage and type of activation were identical in IVF and ICSI patients. The more frequent types of activation were one or two pronuclei and one polar body suggesting that retention of the second polar body is a common event after parthenogenetic activation. CONCLUSIONS: Retention of the second polar body and <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> were observed after parthenogenetic activation, either spontaneous or induced by puromycin. This means that using parthenogenetic embryos for stem cell research will require great care and attention...|$|E
40|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS) is {{the most}} common disease due to an autosomal aneuploidy in live born children and also the major known genetic cause of mental retardation. The risk of a DS pregnancy increases substantially with increasing maternal age. However, several women aged less than 35 years at conception have a child with DS. The micronucleus (MN) assay can identify chromosome breakage or <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> and is an ideal biomarker to investigate genomic instability. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the frequency of peripheral lymphocytes with MN in the parents of DS individuals. The subjects were 17 couples, 1 father and 9 mothers, and 24 couples who had at least one healthy child formed the control group. For each individual we evaluated the frequency of binucleated micronucleated lymphocytes (BNMN%) as number of binucle-ated lymphocytes containing one or more MN per 1000 binucleated cells. The mean age of DS parents and controls was 32. 6 and 29. 8 years, respectively. The frequency of MN in DS parents was significantly higher compared to controls. The highe...|$|E
40|$|The Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (BMCyt) assay is a {{minimally}} invasive method for studying DNA damage, chromosomal instability, cell death and the regenerative potential of human buccal mucosal tissue. This method is increasingly used in molecular epidemiological studies for investigating the impact of nutrition, lifestyle factors, genotoxin exposure and genotype on DNA damage, <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> and cell death. The biomarkers measured in this assay {{have been associated with}} increased risk of accelerated ageing, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. This protocol describes one of the current established methods for buccal cell collection using a small-headed toothbrush, the generation of a single-cell suspension, slide preparation using cytocentrifugation, fixation and staining using Feulgen and Light Green for both bright field and fluorescence microscopic analysis. The scoring criteria for micronuclei and other nuclear anomalies are also described in detail. The protocol in its current form takes approximately 4 h to complete from the time of buccal cell collection to the generation of stained slides for microscopic analysis.

40|$|Abstract Recent {{findings}} seem {{to converge}} towards a unified hypothesis trying to relate Down’s syndrome (DS), trisomy 21 and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The majority of DS individuals develop neuropathological characteristics of AD {{by the age}} of 40. Previous cytogenetic studies performed by us showed an increased frequency of aneuploidy in peripheral lymphocytes and fibroblasts of AD patients and a preferential occurrence of chromosome 21 in malsegregation events. An increased frequency of AD among young mothers of individuals with DS (MDS) is reported. This study investigates the cytogenetic characteristics and the predisposition to <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> of peripheral blood lymphocytes in a group of women (n = 35) who had a Down syndrome child in young age (< 35 years) and in a control group (n = 30). We applied the micronucleus assay and the dual-color FISH in order to assess the susceptibility to malsegregation events. The results indicate a higher frequency of binucleated micronucleated cells in MDS in respect to the control group (16. 1 ± 9. 1 ‰ versus 8. 7 ± 5. 4 ‰). Moreover, our data reveal that peripheral lymphocytes of MDS are more prone to chromosome non-disjunction with both chromosomes, 13 and 21, equally involved...|$|E
40|$|A {{collection}} of chl mutants characterized by decreased fidelity of chromosome transmission and by minichromosome nondisjunction in mitosis was examined for {{the ability to}} maintain nonessential dicentric plasmids. In {{one of the seven}} mutants analyzed, chl 4, dicentric plasmids did not depress cell division. Moreover, nonessential dicentric plasmids were maintained stably without any rearrangements during many generations in the chl 4 mutant. The rate of mitotic heteroallelic recombination in the chl 4 mutant was not increased compared to that in an isogenic wild-type strain. Analysis of the segregation of a marked chromosome indicated that sister chromatid nondisjunction and sister chromatid loss contributed equally to <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> in the chl 4 mutant. A genomic clone of CHL 4 was isolated by complementation of the chl 4 - 1 mutation and was physically mapped to the right arm of chromosome IV near the SUP 2 gene. Nucleotide sequence analysis of CHL 4 clone revealed a 1. 4 -kb open reading frame coding for a 53 -kD predicted protein which does not have homology to published proteins. A strain containing a null allele of CHL 4 is viable under standard growth conditions but has a temperature-sensitive phenotype (conditional lethality at 36 °). We suggest that the CHL 4 gene is required for kinetochore function in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae...|$|E
40|$|We {{recently}} observed {{an increased}} frequency of binucleated micronucleated lymphocytes {{in women who}} had a Down syndrome (DS) child before 35 {{years of age and}} the fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that micronuclei were mainly originating from chromosomal malsegregation events, including chromosome 21 malsegregation. That study indicated that women who have a DS child at a young age might have a genetic predisposition to <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> in both somatic and germ line cells. Further studies from our group confirmed increased chromosome damage in blood cells of women who had a DS child at a young age and pointed to a possible role for polymorphisms in folate-metabolizing genes in affecting both chromosome damage and DS risk. In the present article, we review the most recent findings on mechanisms and risk factors for chromosome 21 nondisjunction that lead to DS. Multiple risk factors are likely involved in chromosome nondisjunction; they act at different times in the meiotic process and can be of genetic or environmental (epigenetic) origin. We also discuss the increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) later in life that was observed in women who had a DS child at a young age. Studies performed in the last years that have shown that the brain is, in fact, a complex genetic mosaic of aneuploid and euploid cells support the unified hypothesis trying to relate DS, trisomy 21, and AD...|$|E

Others have observed {{an association between}} a methionine synthase (MTR 2756 A > G) gene polymorphism and the risk of a DS offspring in Italy. Moreover, in a separate study, we observed an increased frequency of both binucleated micronucleated cells (BNMN) and <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> events in peripheral lymphocytes of mothers of DS individuals aged less than 35 years at conception (MDS) in respect to controls. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate chromosome damage, measured by means of the micronucleus assay, in peripheral lymphocytes of a group of women (n = 34) who had a DS child in young age (T and 1298 A > C, RFC- 1 80 G > A and MTR 2756 A > G polymorphisms. We observed an increased frequency of BNMN in the MDS group compared to the control group (17. 13 +/- 8. 31 per thousand vs. 10. 28 +/- 4. 53 per thousand; P T polymorphism (P = 0. 038) was also found. Present results indicate that MDS are more prone to chromosome damage than control mothers; moreover the contribution of folate and homocysteine metabolizing gene polymorphisms seems to have an effect on the baseline frequency of BNMN lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|Crown {{copyright}} © 2005 Folic acid deficiency {{can lead}} to uracil incorporation into DNA, hypomethylation of DNA, inefficient DNA repair and increase <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> and breakage. Because ionising radiation increases demand for efficient DNA repair and also causes chromosome breaks we hypothesised that folic acid deficiency may increase sensitivity to radiation-induced chromosome breakage. We tested this hypothesis by using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay in 10 day WIL 2 -NS cell cultures at four different folic acid concentrations (0. 2, 2, 20, and 200 nM) that span the "normal" physiological range in humans. The study showed a significant dose-dependent increase in frequency of binucleated cells with micronuclei and/or nucleoplasmic bridges with decreasing folic acid concentration (P< 0. 0001, P= 0. 028, respectively). These biomarkers of chromosomal instability were also increased in cells irradiated (1. 5 Gy gamma-rays) on day 9 relative to un-irradiated controls (P< 0. 05). Folic acid deficiency and gamma-irradiation were shown {{to have a significant}} interactive effect on frequency of cells containing micronuclei (two-way ANOVA, interaction P= 0. 0039) such that the frequency of radiation-induced micronucleated cells (i. e. after subtracting base-line frequency of un-irradiated controls) increased with decreasing folic acid concentration (P-trend< 0. 0001). Aneuploidy of chromosome 21, apoptosis and necrosis were increased by folic acid deficiency but not by ionising radiation. The results of this study show that folate status has an important impact on chromosomal stability and is an important modifying factor of cellular sensitivity to radiation-induced genome damage.

40|$|The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a {{unicellular}} fungus {{that can}} be cultured as a stable haploid or a stable diploid. Diploid cultures can be induced to undergo meiosis in a synchronous fashion under well-defined conditions. Consequently, yeasts {{can be used to}} study genetic effects both in mitotic and in meiotic cells. Haploid strains have been used to study the induction of point mutations. In addition to point mutation induction, diploid strains have been used for studying mitotic recombination, which is the expression of the cellular repair activities induced by inflicted damage. Chromosomal malsegregation in mitotic and meiotic cells can also be studied in appropriately marked strains. Yeast has a considerable potential for endogenous activation, provided the tests are performed with appropriate cells. Exogenous activation has been achieved with S 9 rodent liver in test tubes {{as well as in the}} host-mediated assay, where cells are injected into rodents. Yeast cells can be recovered from various organs and tested for induced genetic effects. The most commonly used genetic end point has been mitotic recombination either as mitotic crossing-over or mitotic gene conversion. A number of different strains are used by different authors. This also applies to haploid strains used for monitoring induction of point mutations. Mitotic <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> has been studied mainly with strain D 6 and meiotic malsegregation with strain DIS 13.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} clearly {{demonstrated}} that aneuploidy may be induced in about 10 to 20 % of oocytes and recently ovulated eggs when female mice are given an intragastric injection of a dilute solution of ethanol. Similar rates of aneuploidy {{have also been}} observed when recently ovulated eggs are briefly exposed in vitro to a dilute solution of ethanol in tissue culture medium. These findings are briefly reviewed, and observations made on the possible underlying mechanism of induction of <b>chromosome</b> <b>malsegregation</b> in the ethanol exposed groups. Attention is drawn to evidence {{from a wide range}} of studies on the effect of ethanol, acetaldehyde (its primary metabolite), and anaesthetics on cell division and chromosome segregation in an attempt to substantiate an hypothesis regarding the mode of action of these agents. In the light of this information, it is hypothesised that exposure to ethanol probably interferes with the normal functioning of the cytoskeletal elements of the spindle apparatus, or its precursor elements, during the first or second meiotic divisions. An attempt is also made to account for the very high incidence of aneuploid conceptuses in man, a high proportion of which are spontaneously aborted. It is hypothesised that exposure to ethanol and other spindle active agents during appropriate stages of oogenesis (in particular during the first meiotic division), and possibly also during spermatogenesis, may be important aetiological factors in a proportion of those cases of spontaneous abortion with a numerical chromosome anomaly for which no other obvious cause is recognised. If it is valid to extrapolate from these experimental findings to the clinical situation in man, it is suggested that attention should also be drawn to the potentially greater hazard to the conceptus which could result from maternal alcohol consumption at and shortly before conception...|$|E
