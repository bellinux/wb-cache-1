40|$|This {{research}} is {{an analysis of}} the major challenges and barriers confronted when considering <b>civil-military</b> <b>coordination</b> in disaster operations. The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate Swedish civil-military governmental organizations strengths and weaknesses together with the intention of increasing <b>civil-military</b> <b>coordination.</b> This study is conducted, to provide knowledge on progress understanding the challenges for <b>civil-military</b> <b>coordination</b> for Sweden.   The main conclusion of the research addresses the findings from Swedish organizations views about conditions for coordination. Also the implications of coordination based on real-life experiences, such as the Haiti earthquake, into a greater civil-military coordinating in disaster operations. Based on this analysis the Swedish organizations paradox remains that; at the same time of increasing demands on efficiency and effectiveness measuring organization’s performances, it presently has also the further demands and growing requests of military involvement in humanitarian operations. Thus, the issue of coordination becomes even more obvious amongst governmental organizations, in such way that it is challenging the current political policies, strategies and mandates, governing organizations today. Coordination becomes evident and illustrates the need for organizational changes; from traditional methods and processes, to a more useful and business oriented operations. Of which, greater efficiency and effectiveness should be the desired output. The question of coordination in disaster operations represents also motivation for organizations, to develop areas of performance in which greater use of their resources and capabilities can be achieved. In view of these, logistical challenges, including clear differences in capabilities, values and focus that make organizations develop in different ways; good examples of coordination were presented. These were intended as a foundation for further discussions among Swedish governmental organizations. Unresolved still, is whether increasing <b>civil-military</b> <b>coordination</b> is a marginal activity in the logistics area and consequently preventing the duplication and overlapping of tasks. Thus, it is more of an integrated activity that seeks to complement responses only partly, or is it more of a single strategy reaching higher effectiveness and efficiency of national resources?  Finally, the empirical findings are highlighting the need for a coherent governance of the humanitarian issue in Sweden. Therefore signifying, the need for greater trust and understanding of each other which should be regarded as the most important factors in the development of efficient <b>civil-military</b> <b>coordination.</b> Including, the need for a national coordination platform in which organizations can coordinate and develop capability for coordination...|$|E
40|$|The extreme {{pressure}} resulting from modern-day disasters {{in terms of}} severe shortages of resources, mass casualties, infrastructure breakdown, large-scale damage and their impact necessitate coordination between all the agencies involved in disaster response. Better coordination in international disaster response operations will make them more effective in organizing the different phases of relief, rehabilitation and recovery. Recent disasters such as the hurricane Katrina, the Indian Ocean tsunami and the earthquake in Haiti have seen multiple civil agencies and the military working together. However, challenges {{have been identified in}} <b>civil-military</b> <b>coordination.</b> Differences in working procedures and a lack of knowledge on the other's organizational identities resulted in stereotyping and prejudices, which are root obstacles to coordination. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the perception-related challenges in <b>civil-military</b> <b>coordination,</b> and how they are perceived in the field by civil and military teams, and to investigate whether perception-related challenges and their implications have been reported in the international literature.

40|$|The First Malayan Emergency (1948 - 1960) was {{the turning}} point for the British {{military}} forces counterinsurgency doctrines as they were facing a traditional type of war, particularly the guerrilla warfare which was triggered by the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) in June 1948. It was a new challenge for the British since during World War 2; most of their campaign {{was focused on the}} conventional warfare. It was a huge significance to the military development of the British, in assessing their forces’ effectiveness in dealings with the insurgency. Eventually in Malaya, the British came out with the idea to “winning hearts and mind” of the Malayan citizen through the implementation of “The Briggs Plan” which was founded by Lieutenant General Sir Harold Briggs. This paper will briefly explain the importance of the British counterinsurgency doctrine development in Malaya through the manifestation of the Briggs Plan and its significance towards the beginning of the effective countermeasures in dealing with the CPM armed insurrections. Furthermore, there has been limited credits given to Briggs on the success of his plan even though we knew that the plan was carried out in just 18 months: a tight window for the time of execution. The Briggs Plan somehow shows the importance of the <b>Civil-Military</b> <b>coordination</b> in their war against the Communist insurrection in Malaya thus justifying the military intervention as inadequate to hunt down the Communist guerrillas successfully without a good coordination and cooperation from the civil administrative. The conclusion will include the effective outcomes of the Briggs Plan as the pioneer of the future British counterinsurgency programs in Malaya respectively. It is not unwarranted if some historians highlighted that Sir Harold Briggs was the British “saviour” in the early Malaya.

40|$|Over a seven year period, {{culminating}} in 1999, several NATO panels developed a NATO Code of Best Practice (COBP) for C 2 Assessment. That product {{was focused on}} the assessment of C 2 issues in the context of conventional conflict. Subsequently, a follow on Study Group, Studies, Analysis, and Simulation (SAS) – 026, was formed to explore the application and extension of the COBP to C 2 issues in the context of Operations Other Than War (OOTW). In order to achieve that objective, SAS- 026 convened two complementary workshops: a (relatively) well-defined assessment of alternative <b>Civil–Military</b> <b>coordination</b> (CIMIC) centers {{in the context of the}} on-going Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia and a broader assessment of the full set of C 2 issues confronting SFOR.

This article examines how lessons from early protection crises led the UN missions in the DRC to develop a series of innovative tools for a better peacekeeping response based on improved <b>civil-military</b> <b>coordination</b> and enhanced communication with the local population. It analyzes how the need to mitigate {{the negative impact of}} joint UN-Congolese military operations led to a progressive shift from a largely UN-centric and troop-intensive approach to physical protection to a greater focus on the Congolese security forces. As the UN peacekeeping understanding of the protection of civilians – and its concomitant bureaucracy – continues to expand, peacekeeping strategies should refocus on strengthening national protection capacities through security sector reform. This article concludes that the 2012 crisis in DRC could serve as a trigger for such a shift, aimed at building legitimate institutions and encouraging the host government to shoulder its primary responsibility to protect its citizens.

The scenario aims to highlight some {{challenges and opportunities}} for semantic integration and knowledge processing in support of humanitarian relief efforts undertaken {{against a backdrop of}} military conflict. The scenario depicts an earthquake and associated flood event occurring in Afghanistan {{at the time of the}} US-led coalition effort to displace the former Taliban regime. The flood event occurs as a secondary phenomenon to the earthquake and precipitates a full-scale humanitarian relief effort co-opting the resources of both humanitarian and military agencies. This scenario will serve to showcase the capabilities of the AKTiveSA TDS with respect to enhanced situation awareness and improved information fusion. Such capabilities depend on the ability to exploit multiple sources of information and sophisticated query capabilities in order to expedite the dissemination of relevant information to executive agencies in a timely and appropriate fashion.

40|$|What was the idea? Coordination {{is a vital}} {{element of}} crisis {{management}} (Turner, 1978; Minear et al., 1992; Schneider, 1995; Rasmussen, 1997; Strand, 2003; Boin et al., 2005; Kruke and Olsen, 2005; Keen, 2008). The coordination between civil and military actors is especially crucial and complicated if the crisis is characterized by political (military), economic, and social conflict, as displayed in Afghanistan. Civil and military actors have different organizational cultures, standard operating procedures, aims and priorities. Still, they are often forced to coordinate in order to perform their humanitarian, political and military tasks in joint efforts to assist the local populations in a complex emergency. To manage this coordination, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in North-Afghanistan operated under three concepts: the Comprehensive Approach (CA), Counterinsurgency (COIN), and the NATO <b>civil-military</b> <b>coordination</b> (CIMIC) doctrine. These three approaches, to some extent, overlapped, to some extent were contradictory, but most important; they were differently understood and implemented with various levels of success. ISAF, as a powerful military actor in Afghanistan, consists of many high qualified and capable soldiers at all levels. The question is whether {{it is possible for}} such an organization as ISAF to handle crisis management under the guidance of these coordination concepts and the broad mandates operational in Afghanistan? To enlighten this, the structures and processes in ISAF organization are studied in order to assess how these structures/ processes influenced the civil military coordination in the field. With the aim of contributing to the enhanced knowledge about civil military coordination, I put forth the following research question: - How do ISAF structures and processes influence civil military coordination in North Afghanistan? In the analysis I have applied theories of security and the new wars, complex emergencies and, in particular, organizational theories with a basis in bureaucracy-theory and new-institutional perspectives. The rationale behind this choice was that military organizations are normally viewed as representatives of rational bureaucratic organizations, having structures and processes that characterize rational organizations (Weber, 1971; Banfield, 1959; Lindblom, 1959). The new-institutional perspective is meant to be a tool to explain the shortcomings of rationally built organizations and the influence of the surrounding environment (Greenwood et al., 2008; Meyer and Rowan, 1977; DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). Further, the use of Turner (1976 / 1978) and Turner and Pigeon’s (1997) theories of man-made disasters enlighten the crisis management perspective. What was done? To be able to understand and collect genuine data about ISAF’s influence on civil military coordination, it was essential to get personal experiences from the field. After attending pre-deployment courses I was sent to North Afghanistan as a CIMIC officer, doing participant-observer research for a seven month fieldwork. Back home, the data was systematized and followed up the year after by a new field work in the same operation area, then in the role of a declared researcher, for enhanced data collection based on interviews and meetings. As a CIMIC officer I followed the ISAF “project factory” in North- Afghanistan. The “project factory” were local, regional or national ongoing projects characterized by military involvement and extensive civil military coordination, - through which I studied many parallel processes. I did not have the opportunity to follow any of these projects from planning to implementation and evaluation, as projects at this level often were ongoing for years, and my deployment represented seven months in line with the military rotation system. Consequently, to many ISAF officers including myself, these projects represented “a running train” in which one had to jump on and off on the way. Still, the processes in the six projects in which I participated became vital sources of information in my data collection. After getting a picture of ISAF structure and processes during my first fieldwork, I focused more on the understanding and interpretation of ISAF mandate and civil military concepts in the second follow up field-work. Civil and military personnel representing three levels were interviewed: ISAF Joint Command (IJC) in Kabul, the subordinated Regional Command North (RCN) in nearby Mazar-e Sharif and the RCN subordinated Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), representing many countries, stationed in different provinces. Also document analysis, meetings, discussions and field conversations contributed to my data collection. What came out of it? By studying ISAF organization in North Afghanistan, influential aspects to civil military coordination became apparent. It is essential to acknowledge the importance of cultural awareness and understanding of the context in a so-called “out of area” operation such as the one ISAF conducted in Afghanistan. Moreover, the Western way of conflict management based on Western logic, rationality, expectations, and traditions might not be appropriate. One also needs to acknowledge the difference between civilian and military actors. As experienced in the studied projects military tend to be action-minded with a high sense of responsibility and control. This might result in narrower thinking in line with their own training and experience for accomplishing a mission with a specific, usually short timeline. Civilian actors, even though they are very varied, more often have a long term perspective and focus on the local structures and processes. Successful, sustainable projects presuppose local ownership, which mostly requires a long term perspective. Accordingly, when military actors are engaged in the civilian sphere as presupposed in the overall civil military coordination concepts applicable for ISAF, this requires a long term perspective, consistency, and clear lines of role performance and responsibility. This was not the case. ISAF displayed internal diversity in preparedness, priorities, and policy. The practice of ISAF <b>civil-military</b> <b>coordination</b> did not ensure local ownership of projects, as they were mostly ISAF planned and executed, within a strict timeline. An important source of ISAF coordination problems were the unclear civil military concepts of CA, COIN and CIMIC or Civil Affairs doctrine. The concepts were differently understood, prioritized, and interpreted in different NATO and non-NATO ISAF participating nations, {{as well as on the}} different ISAF organizational levels, being well known in upper headquarters and more or less unknown or ignored out in the field. Besides, this diversity of interpretation of the concepts also led to organizational inconsistency, hampering appropriate coordination with the local environment and other actors presupposed for an appropriate crisis management. The ISAF inconsistency gave a picture of an organization with many nuances which coordinating actors found difficult to read. Findings show how ISAF, an intended rational bureaucratic organization, was faced with diversity and inconsistency in organizational structures, as well as training, planning, and role performance. Accordingly, ISAF strove to keep the needed unity of effort that characterizes a functional military organization. Structural problems such as a very top heavy organization, different organized headquarters, and multiple reporting lines influenced and complicated civil military coordination processes in general, as well as in the planning and execution of projects. Military planning and decision-making processes were exigent, with no overall clear end-state 1 or aim to measure the activity against and the multiple reporting lines complicating the information and communication processes. Besides, the vague and broad ISAF mandate gave plenty of room for varied interpretation and practice. Additionally, internal coordination were hampered by different national policies and trainings before mission, as well as the fact that ISAFparticipating nations had different national caveats that blocked the unity of effort as well as an efficient command and control structure. 1 End state is a military term used in this thesis, meaning the set of required conditions that defines achievement of the Commanders’ objectives. Findings also indicate that theories like rational and new-institutional organization theories are applicable when analyzing the military structures, processes, and role performance, and how this affects civil military coordination. Nevertheless, the most important contribution of this thesis is empirical, composed as it is of a data collection that would have been very difficult to achieve without being on the inside of the organization. This research shows how important it is to make clear distinction between civilian and military responsibilities, in time and space, if and when military is involved in civilian projects. If military actors are engaged in civil military coordination tasks and projects they should not be a subject to the same logic of action as the kinetic units. Further, if military is supposed to keep security, a more strict and joint military command and control system, as well as a more specific defined concept of action and tasks is necessary...|$|E
40|$|The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) designates {{homeland}} defense (HD) {{as one of}} {{the three}} core pillars of the nation’s current and future defense strategy. Defending the homeland from external threats and aggression requires a robust military capability. In this sense, both the federal Armed Forces (active and reserve components), as well as state National Guard forces play important roles in the defense of the nation. Further, HD often overlaps with civil support (CS) and homeland security to form a triad of domestic military operational domains. Where the roles, responsibilities, and limitations of the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces are relatively clear in this triad, the National Guard is a unique military entity capable of serving in either a state-controlled or federally controlled status during domestic operations. Whether the Guard operates in a state-funded, state-controlled status (State Active Duty [SAD]); a federally funded, state-controlled status (Title 32); or a federally funded and controlled status (Title 10) is a topic of ongoing debate during CS missions. Regardless of their duty status in such situations, the National Guard contributes to the security, protection, and well-being of the population. As such, it is important to continually assess the roles, responsibilities, and organizational orientation of the National Guard during domestic operations in support of civil authorities, and to ensure the states and federal government maximize the utility of this unique military capability when it matters most. As part of the ongoing effort to improve domestic mission capabilities in support of civil authorities, the Department of Defense (DoD) continually evaluates new and different approaches to achieving enhanced <b>civil-military</b> <b>coordination.</b> In this context, the unique position of the Guard as either a state or federal military forcedepending on duty status designationbrings added complexity to the already difficult task of ensuring a well-coordinated state and federal military response effort. As such, there has been continued debate over whether the National Guardor specific elements thereofshould serve in a permanent federal capacity to better support the nation’s security and disaster response mission. As a result of that ongoing discussion, the 2014 - 2015 Army War College’s Key Strategic Issues List (KSIL) asks: “what would be the benefits and drawbacks of realigning the [National] Guard under the [Department] of Homeland Security to enhance domestic security and disaster response, while retaining utility for overseas missions in support of the Department of Defense?” This monograph details our efforts to research and evaluate the perceived benefits and drawbacks of realigning the National Guard under the DHS, as per the KSIL topic noted above. We begin with a brief review of the relevant literature shaping the current policy and doctrinal approach to military CS operations, including a summary of laws and strategic guidance relevant to the discussion. We then note the important distinctions between homeland security (HS) and HD and the military role in each context. The seam between HS and HD provides a conceptual basis for discussing the roles and responsibilities of the National Guard, the DHS, and the DoD within domestic security and disaster response operations. After evaluating the National Guard’s role in each of the above contexts, we briefly discuss the realignment of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) within the DHS as a proxy for comparison of a similar realignment of a military-style entity under the DHS. Then, drawing from interviews with relevant subject matter experts, we present several potential benefits and drawbacks of a Guard realignment to the DHS as noted by those interviewed for this monograph. Interview subjects represented a broad range of backgrounds, including officers from both the Army and Air National Guard; the Maryland and Delaware state emergency management agencies; active and retired U. S. Coast Guard officers; the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); U. S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM); current and former senior DoD officials with experience in homeland defense and CS operations; as well as representatives from academia with specific interests in military-involved state and federal operations. The study concludes with five short recommendations in summary of the research effort...|$|E
