50|$|Obtaining the ROM data by oneself {{directly}} from the hardware being emulated can be extremely difficult, technical, and expensive, since it may require desoldering of integrated circuit chips from the circuit board of the device they own.

5000|$|Commonly {{referred}} to as a [...] "Chip-Off" [...] technique within the industry, the last and most intrusive method to get a memory image is to desolder the non-volatile memory chip and connect it to a memory <b>chip</b> <b>reader.</b> This method contains the potential danger of total data destruction: it is possible to destroy the chip and its content because of the heat required during desoldering. Before the invention of the BGA technology it was possible to attach probes to the pins of the memory chip and to recover the memory through these probes. The BGA technique bonds the chips directly onto the PCB through molten solder balls, such that it is no longer possible to attach probes.|$|E

Our chip system is based on allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mutations. The probes attached to the chip surface consist of oligonucleotides containing the point mutations and the three corresponding control sequences. The labeled target cDNAs used for hybridization are derived from genomic or subcloned genomic DNA via asymmetric PCR, which is specially adapted for the synthesis of labeled single stranded target DNA. In addition to the useage of a <b>chip</b> <b>reader,</b> evaluation of the hybridized chip is adapted for using enhanced chemiluminescence.

MethodsSerum samples from 63 lung cancer patients with Qi deficiency syndrome and phlegm and blood stasis, and 28 lung cancer patients with non-Qi deficiency syndrome and phlegm and blood stasis were analyzed using SELDI-TOF-MS with a PBS II-C protein <b>chip</b> <b>reader.</b> Protein profiles were generated using immobilized metal affinity capture (IMAC 3) protein chips. Differentially-expressed proteins were screened. Protein peak clustering and classification analyses were performed using Biomarker Wizard and Biomarker Pattern software packages, respectively. ResultsA total of 268 effective protein peaks were detected in the 1, 000 – 10, 000 Da molecular range for the 15 serum proteins screened (P< 0. 05). The decision tree model was M 2284. 97, with a sensitivity of 96. 2 % and a specificity of 66. 7 %.

40|$|Abstract: Multiple {{studies have}} {{reported}} that surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of fl ight mass spectroscopy (SELDI-TOF-MS) is useful in the early detection of disease based on the analysis of bodily fl uids. Use of any multiplex mass spectroscopy based approach as {{in the analysis of}} bodily fl uids to detect disease must be analyzed with great care due to the susceptibility of multiplex and mass spectroscopy methods to biases introduced via experimental design, patient samples, and/or methodology. Specifi c biases include those related to experimental design, patients, samples, protein chips, <b>chip</b> <b>reader</b> and spectral analysis. Contributions to biases based on patients include demographics (e. g., age, race, ethnicity, sex), homeostasis (e. g., fasting, medications, stress, time of sampling), and site of analysis (hospital, clinic, other). Biases in samples include conditions of sampling (type of sample container, time of processing, time to storage), conditions of storage, (time and temperature of storage), and prior sample manipulation (freeze thaw cycles). Also, there are many potential biases in methodology which can be avoided by careful experimental design including ensuring that cases and controls are analyzed randomly. All the above forms of biases affect any system based on analyzing multiple analytes and especially all mass spectroscopy based methods, not just SELDI-TOF-MS. Also, all current mass spectroscopy systems have relatively low sensitivity compared with immunoassays (e. g., ELISA). There are several problems which may be unique to the SELDI-TOF-MS system marketed by Ciphergen®. Of these, the most important is a relatively low resolution (± 0. 2 %) of the bundled mass spectrometer which may cause problems with analysis of data. Foremost, thi...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the development of}} lab-on-a-chip devices have been rapid and broad ranging.

Foremost, this low resolution results in difficulties in determining what constitutes a “peak” if a peak matching approach is used in analysis. Also, once peaks are selected, the peaks may represent multiple proteins. In addition, because peaks may vary slightly in location due to instrumental drift, long term identification of the same peaks may prove to be a challenge. Finally, the Ciphergen® system has some “noise” of the baseline which results from the accumulation of charge in the detector system. Thus, we must be very aware of the factors that may affect the use of proteomics in the early detection of disease, in determining aggressive subsets of cancers, in risk assessment and in monitoring the effectiveness of novel therapies...|$|E
30|$|Nests were {{continually}} monitored using {{a camera}} system {{integrated into the}} nest boxes (Bezouška et al. 2005) from the hatching period {{to the end of}} each nestling period (mean, 16.3 ± 8.0 days/nest). Because Boreal Owls exhibit hatching asynchrony with hatching spans that average 6 to 7 days (Korpimäki 1981 Valkama et al. 2002), both eggs and hatched nestlings were found at nests at the time of camera installation. We recorded the actual foraging situation at these nests at the time of camera installation via the number of nestlings hatched and the number of stored prey items. We had three camera boxes; thus, we could simultaneously monitor three nests. The equipment we used to monitor the parental feeding effort consisted of a camera (DECAM, SINIT, Czech Republic), a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag reader device (PS 02, ELVIS, Czech Republic), a movement infrared detector (KS 96, KOTLIN, Czech Republic), and infrared lighting (IR diodes, SFH 485 – 2 880 nm, SOS electronic, Czech Republic). The camera viewfinder was installed inside the nest box opposite the opening. The camera device and <b>chip</b> <b>reader</b> device were installed in a special wooden box {{on the roof of the}} nest box. Each time an owl entered the nest box, the IR motion detector triggered the camera, taking digital images of the owl in the nest box entrance (n = 1 to 3 pictures, 1, 024 pictures could be stored in total). During the night, the opening was illuminated by infrared diodes at the moment the photos were made by the camera. To determine which individual entered or left the nest box, adults (12 females and 7 males) were fitted with a PIT tag ring (BR chip ring, BENZING, Schruns, Austria, primarily used for homing pigeons). The PIT tag reader (circle aerial with a 12 -cm diameter) was integrated into the entrance hole of the nest box and registered all movements of marked individuals in and out of the box. For camera boxes, we randomly chose among suitable nest boxes (i.e., boxes where it was possible to remove the old box, appropriate timing, and avoiding boxes located close to roads and paths to avoid attracting the attention of members of the public to the camera boxes). Upon finding a suitable nest, we replaced the old box with a camera box (at the time of late incubation or hatching). No female abandoned her nest as a result of nest box transfer. The entire camera system was powered by a 60 -Ah accumulator (DELPHI, AUTO Štangl, Czech Republic) and changed every 6 to 8 days.|$|E
