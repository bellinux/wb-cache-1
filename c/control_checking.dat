5000|$|Several {{sharpened}} {{pieces of}} flint {{dating back to}} the Paleolithic period have been found within the Graves de Vayres appellation. The wine region itself dates back to the Gallo-Roman age. Vayres is situated on the Dordogne, near the Voie impériale, a Roman road that runs from Bordeaux to Périgueux. The Emperor Octavius understood the strategic importance of this place, and based a garrison here under the command of Varius, who would leave the name Vayres (varatedo) to the village. From the mid-19th Century, red and white wines from the Graves de Vayres appellation were renowned, as Cocks and Féret mention in Bordeaux et ses vins ("Bordeaux and its wines"): [...] Without claiming to rival those of Médoc or Saint-Emilion, the red wines of Graves de Vayres are nevertheless full of delicacy. Its Premiers crus are highly sought after for their body and finesse, and can be classed among the best wines of the Libournais, directly after the Deuxièmes crus of Pomerol. Its whites still remain in favour with lovers of Northern-French varieties, and have gained a significant place in several foreign markets. [...] Numerous documents are still around today concerning a sufficient amount of winegrowers to form a collective use of the appellation [...] "Graves de Vayres". It is mentioned in the price lists of Horeau Beylot et Cie (1890), Jacquet et Fils (1895) and Legendre et Cie (1898), as well as in price lists of Libournais traders. The name is also used in the inventory and trade records of numerous Bordeaux wine houses, and began appearing on printed labels in 1904. The exposition of a Monsieur Béchaud at the Bordeaux Wine Market in November 1909 again indicates the existence of the Graves de Vayres appellation. On 3 January 1962, the Winemakers' Union of Graves de Vayres was formed. It decided, by virtue of local, loyal and constant use, to include the gravelly soils of the Arveyres plateau, along with those of Vayres, in the appellation area of Graves de Vayres. This winemakers' union {{was among the first to}} appear in Gironde, and in 1966, it established the institution of quality <b>control</b> <b>checking</b> wine, which was done by taste and analysis. Quality remains a priority for wines made in the 600-odd hectares of this appellation area in the heart of Bordeaux. Pre-approval is arranged with winemakers, and a committee from the wine region tracks the cultivation of the vines.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We propose {{an access}} control model that generalizes Role-Based Access Control {{by making a}} {{distinction}} between what we call ascribed status and action status. The model {{is based upon the}} key notion of an event to enable changes in access control requirements to be performed autonomously. Our access control model is specified as a term rewriting system that permits declarative representation of access control requirements, proving of properties of access control policies defined in terms of our model, and fast prototyping of access <b>control</b> <b>checking.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Encapsulation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} features of objectoriented programming. Reducing the interface where software components can communicate with each other increases software quality, security and decreases development cost. Compile time or runtime visibility and access <b>control</b> <b>checking</b> that support encapsulation is the key part of modern languages and runtime environments. They enforce responsibility separation, implementation and security policies. Most modern programming languages like C++, C # and Java do not have sophisticated access control mechanisms only introduce a subset or combination of the following access modifiers: public, private, protected, internal, and friend while Eiffel defines sophisticated selective access control called selective export. In this paper first we describe the existing access control features of C++, C#, Java, Eiffel and other popular programming languages. After that we show an example where the current access control features of C # (and most object-oriented languages) are insufficient. We introduce a method level access <b>control</b> <b>checking</b> mechanism to C # 3. 0 using extension methods which is able to enforce Eiffel-like selective export in runtime. Our implementation does not require the modification of the compiler and the caller, only the callee, and introduces minimal syntactic and performance overhead. It can be a practical solution for modular systems where runtime security is important...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Despite the {{widespread}} adoption of Role-based Access Control (RBAC) models, new access control models {{are required for}} new applications for which RBAC may not be especially well suited and for which implementations of RBAC do not enable properties of access control policies to be adequately defined and proven. To address these issues, we propose a form of access control model that {{is based upon the}} key notion of an event. The access control model that we propose is intended to permit the representation of access control requirements in a distributed and changing computing environment, the proving of properties of access control policies defined in terms of our model, and direct implementations for access <b>control</b> <b>checking.</b> ...|$|E

Our research program aimed to understand the behavior of individuals when performing label checks on fresh produce in order to inform {{the development of a}} software application designed to support quality control. On a simulated label checking task, eye-tracking data showed that individuals used different checking methods. A more systematic method led to higher accuracy. Two computer-assisted approaches, varying in the level of computer support provided, were then designed to push checkers towards systematic checking. Greater improvements in accuracy were found under the computer-assisted approaches than under a control condition. A three-month onsite trial of a software application designed {{on the basis of these}} research findings led to a 100 % decrease in quality control errors...|$|E

Analysis of an empirical data set of single nucleotide polymorphisms possibly related to colon cancer reveals that missing genotypes are not missing completely at random.

If we want to know better the future development of brown coal consumption in the whole region of Slovakia we have to know the development in smaller territories.

Observing the development of gas distribution is the only way how to find out the decrease of brown coal consumption in smaller territories. The development of gas distribution is better defined, because there is only one gas distributor in Slovakia.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a dependability framework for the call-processing environment in a digital mobile telephone network controller. The target environment includes a database subsystem containing configuration parameters and resource usage status, and call-processing clients for managing individual calls. This environment presents some unique challenges, since a malfunctioning client can write erroneous data to the database, and errors in the database can impact the call-processing clients. The paper describes an integrated dependability framework for the controller. The framework contains a data audit subsystem to maintain the structural and semantic integrity of the database and a preemptive control flow checking technique, PECOS, to protect the clients. Evaluation of the dependability-enhanced system by software-implemented error injection is performed. The evaluation shows that for control flow errors in the client, the combination of PECOS and data audit eliminates fail-silence violations, reduces the incidence of client crashes from 52 % to 19 %, and eliminates client hangs. For database injections, data audit detects 85 % of the errors and reduces the incidence of escaped errors from 63 % to 13 %. Evaluation of combined use of data and <b>control</b> <b>checking</b> (while error injection targets the database and the client) shows coverage of 80 % and indicates data flow errors as a key reason for error escapes.

We developed a new conception and development model for new products and services, betting on a bigger research of information by the company employees before they validate any phase of the project.
