This <b>chapter</b> will <b>counter</b> the assumption that play-based learning is of value only to Early Years teaching and learning by outlining how {{it has been used}} to develop and carry-out research within a Higher Education postgraduate programme. By outlining a number of benefits of play-based approaches to teaching, learning and wider curriculum development at postgraduate level, this chapter demonstrates how a play-based approach to postgraduate programmes can enable programme teams to create transformative learning environments that enable risk-taking and innovation, enhancing the creative practice of learners and meet the changing needs of a contemporary workplace...|$|R
50|$|Real Knockouts made McCaughey's mark {{in feminist}} theory, {{as the first}} {{comprehensive}} attempt {{to bridge the gap}} between academia and mainstream women's self-defense. In it, she defines the self-defense movement serves as a form of feminist empowerment and consciousness raising that can be used to make feminist theory accessible to women who would otherwise be unreceptive. She also proposes the idea that by participating in self-defense, women change the definition of femininity and alter the gender roles, both male and female, that support existing rape culture. Although McCaughey takes a generally positive stance regarding self-defense, and dedicates a <b>chapter</b> to <b>countering</b> various criticisms of women's self-defense from within feminist theory, she does acknowledge and examine several practical and legal concerns with self-defense. As part of that, she analyzes the legal repercussions of violent self-defense, including consideration of the way that racism, classism, sexism, and stereotypes concerning battered wife syndrome affect the legal system's judgement on whether or not a woman's self-defense is legitimate.|$|R
40|$|The comic in Ulysses {{needs more}} attention. The few studies that exist {{disregard}} the problems: {{the adoption of}} assumptions which limit discussion, the inconsistent terminology, the lingering prejudice regarding comedy as inferior to tragedy. This study begins by examining the common assumption that comedy in Ulysses is either a restraint on Joyce's saeva indignatio, or an affirmation of life; and then looks at the difficulties of comic criticism. Chapter two considers modern comedy, distinguishes three schools of theory, and indicates how these will be considered in relation to Ulysses. <b>Chapter</b> three, <b>countering</b> the assumptions observed in chapter one, discusses the book's refusal to indulge the reader's desire for certainty, illustrating this with a criticism of Kenner's conception of Joycean irony and Goldberg's reading of the 'Nausicaa' episode. Chapter four examines Mulligan: " in risu veritas : for nothing so reveals us as cur laughter" (Joyce). Using Freud's study of aggressive jokes, it works backwards from 'Circe,' where Mulligan is revealed in his true (motley) colours. Chapter five evaluates Bloom's comic/ heroism, working with Bergson's study of social laughter and against Darcy O'Brien. The final chapter considers farce, particularly in 'Cyclops' and 'Circe,' using Bergson's body-as-machine theory and Bakhtin's study of the medieval carnival in Rabelais and his World. </p...|$|R
40|$|Relying on Lucien Goldmann's {{theory of}} genetic structuralism, this study {{examines}} the relationship between ideology (world vision) and the autobiographical form in South African writing. The five autobiographers selected for discussion represent different social groups in the South African social formation. The central argument of this thesis {{is that there is}} a relationship between autobiographical self-portraiture and the collective interests, values and attitudes of particular social groups in South Africa. Therefore, most South African autobiographies are more concerned with the articulation of collective consciousness than with the celebration of individual talents and achievements. Chapter 1 on Peter Abrahams explores the values underpinning the ideology of liberal humanism and their influence on the process of self-representation within the mode of autobiography. The second chapter examines the apparently contradictory conceptions of self-identity in Bloke Modisane's autobiography. Chapter three focuses on the conflict between Naboth Mokgatle's ethnic loyalty to the Bafokeng tribe and his newly acquired radical working class consciousness. The fourth chapter examines the liberal-Christian ideology in Alan Paton's two volumes of autobiography. The fifth and final <b>chapter</b> explores <b>counter</b> hegemonic modes of self-definition in Sindiwe Magona's two-volumed autobiography. In all the five chapters there is an attempt to link the authors' self-presentation to specific social classes or groups. The thesis argues for a literary-sociological approach to the analysis of autobiography and seeks to challenge the deconstructive theoretical perspectives on autobiography which, by rejecting the validity of humanist assumptions regarding human subjectivity, deny any possibility of meaningful socio-political action.

40|$|Lewisian Genuine Realism (GR) about {{possible}} worlds is often deemed unable to accommodate impossible worlds and {{reap the benefits}} that these bestow to rival theories. This thesis explores two alternative extensions of GR into the terrain of impossible worlds. It is divided in six chapters. Chapter I outlines Lewis’ theory, the motivations for impossible worlds, and the central problem that such worlds present for GR: How can GR even understand {{the notion of an}} impossible world, given Lewis’ reductive theoretical framework? Since the desideratum is to incorporate impossible worlds into GR without compromising Lewis’ reductive analysis of modality, Chapter II defends that analysis against (old and new) objections. The rest of the thesis is devoted to incorporating impossible worlds into GR. Chapter III explores GR-friendly impossible worlds in the form of set-theoretic constructions out of genuine possibilia. Then, Chapters IV-VI venture into concrete impossible worlds. Chapter IV addresses Lewis’ objection against such worlds, to the effect that contradictions true at impossible worlds amount to true contradictions tout court. I argue that even if so, the relevant contradictions are only ever about the non-actual, and that Lewis’ argument relies on a premise that cannot be nonquestion- beggingly upheld in the face of genuine impossible worlds in any case. Chapter V proposes that Lewis’ reductive analysis can be preserved, {{even in the face of}} genuine impossibilia, if we differentiate the impossible from the possible by means of accessibility relations, understood non-modally in terms of similarity. Finally, <b>Chapter</b> VI <b>counters</b> objections to the effect that there are certain impossibilities, formulated in Lewis’ theoretical language, which genuine impossibilia should, but cannot, represent. I conclude that Genuine Realism is still very much in the running when the discussion turns to impossible worlds...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} eighteenth-century portraiture {{within the}} context of 'norms' propagated in contemporary prescriptive and fictional literature, 'norms' which overlay a heterogeneous reality. The aspirant portraitist had to accord with the desire of sitters to be depicted in a manner that would receive approbation. Thus, disparate relationships were pictorially subsumed within affectionate ideals that burgeoned in the mid eighteenth century, stimulated by the cult of sensibility and disseminated through an expanding body of literature to an expanding readership. However, these did not displace more 'traditional' concerns, but appeared alongside continuing pictorial emphases on patriarchy, hierarchy and dynastic continuity. The introduction outlines the historiography and methodology and provides a detailed summary of each chapter. Chapter one examines the emergence of the companionate marital portrait, together with pictorial condemnations of arranged and romantic unions. Chapter two argues that this new emphasis on affection did not displace patriarchy. Pendants continued to demarcate masculine and feminine domains whilst double portraits emphasised those domains as complementary, but unequal. Chapter three discusses the pictorial and literary sentimentalisation of motherhood and argues that condemnations of female display were acknowledged in portraits of engrossed and self-effacing mothers. <b>Chapter</b> four <b>counters</b> that the sentimentalisation of the patriarch was limited by a continuing preoccupation with his pre-eminence and that later images of playful children maintained earlier concerns with age and gender hierarchies and 'futurity'. Chapter five argues that both an emphasis on heirs and anxiety over the implications of high infant mortality for dynastic succession remained constant. The contextualisation of portraits within the home also reveals an emphasis on unbroken lineage. Chapter six examines satires of transgressions of ideal familial relations by members of a supposedly debauched aristocracy. However, these aristocrats sometimes countered such attacks with portraits emphasising status and domestic virtue. The conclusion summarises the arguments and discusses their implications for debates over class...|$|R
40|$|The {{arrival of}} asylum seekers in Australia during the 1980 s {{through to the}} first decade of the twenty-first century caused much controversy. A number of {{prejudicial}} false beliefs have formed around this phenomenon. This <b>chapter</b> discusses and <b>counters</b> four common false beliefs: ‘most asylum seekers arrive by boat’, ‘seeking asylum without authorisation from Australian authorities is illegal under Australian law’, ‘refugees get all sorts of government handouts’ and ‘giving temporary protection visas will stop asylum seekers coming to Australia by boat’. We note these myths are often found in political rhetoric indicating the social nature of individual attitudes. We also examine refugee advocates’ public rhetoric in challenging common false beliefs by arguing that they are ‘just like us’. While this is a useful strategy to challenge dominant discourse, it can backfire in that it implies the impossibility of social harmony based on diversity. We also examine the need for community-based action to engage with and counter prejudice and its bases. We conclude with an argument for the value of an interdisciplinary approach and the need to address both micro and macro issues within the framework of peace psychology in order to effect social change...|$|R
40|$|Education and {{training}} in ethics has been given increased importance and urgency by recent corporate collapses of high-profile companies. These events have encouraged the media and public to question the ethical standards and behaviours of auditors and accountants. There is {{a high level of}} cynicism and scepticism in the profession that ethics can be ‘taught’ to auditing and accounting students and practitioners. This <b>chapter</b> seeks to <b>counter</b> these perceptions by arguing that the ethical awareness of auditors can be raised by attacking certain widely-held ‘myths’ about the nature and teaching of ethics. These myths include cynicism that the teaching of ethics can make any difference, or that ethics is simply a matter of personal opinion, or that the study of ethics must start with the study of ethical theory rather than practical experience. This chapter emphasises that ethics is about power relationships and responsibility, and that developing the practical skills of students and practitioners in values clarification, ethical decision-making and ethical policy-setting can not only raise ethical awareness in the professions of auditing and accounting, but also improve standards of practice. It is argued that improving ethical competence in the profession and striving for excellence in practice are not just starry-eyed ideals, but achievable with relevant curriculum planning and the use of effective teaching methods...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} Cold War writings {{and activities of}} the American commentator Walter Lippmannin particular his observations about U. S. policy in Vietnam. Lippmann was the preeminent columnist of his era, writing 2, 300 installments of his Today and Tomorrow column between 1945 and 1967. Lippmann crafted a conceptual framework for promoting American internationalism that blended political realism, cosmopolitanism, and classical diplomacy. That approach shaped {{his role as a}} moderator of the domestic and international dialogue about the Cold War, as a facilitator of ideas and policies, and as a quasi-diplomat. Chapter one suggests that based on new archival sources a re-evaluation of Lippmann is necessary to correct inadequacies in the standard literature. Chapter two surveys his strategic internationalist approach to foreign affairs from the publication of his first foreign policy book in 1915 to three influential volumes he wrote between 1943 and 1947. Chapter three explores Lippmann's position on a prominent and controversial Cold War issuethe partition of Germany. Chapter four makes a comparative analysis of Lippmann with the French commentator Raymond Aron, examining Lippmann's part as a dialogue-shaper and public broker during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the subsequent debate about nuclear sharing in the Atlantic Alliance. Chapter five moves the study toward his writings on U. S. policy in Asiaparticularly U. S. -China policy and the Korean War. Chapter six examines Lippmann's analyses of U. S. -Vietnam policy from 1949 to 1963 framed by three consistent arguments: first, that America had no vital interests at stake there; second, that it could not win a military victory there at any reasonable cost; and, third, that its best course was to use diplomacy to promote Vietnamese neutralism. Chapter seven explores Lippmann's efforts to dissuade U. S. officials from intervention in 1964. Chapter eight details policymakers' elaborate efforts to delay Lippmann's public criticisms of the Vietnam policies. Chapter nine explores the Johnson administration's determination to discredit Lippmann's public criticisms of the war after July 1965. <b>Chapter</b> ten <b>counters</b> the standard literature's portrayal of Lippmann's Cold War commentary and suggests that his most influential activity as a public figure may have been as a quasi-diplomatist...|$|R
40|$|This <b>chapter</b> {{seeks to}} <b>counter</b> the ethical apathy French philosopher Alain Badiou {{attributes}} to the ‘victim mentality’ of Western liberal society, a mentality that stems from our over-reliance on the post-Holocaust notion of Radical evil. It does so by revalorising, through a close reading of Jonathan Littell’s fictional 2006 autobiography {{of a former}} Nazi, The Kindly Ones (Les Bienveillantes), an alternative strand of post-Holocaust thought: namely, Hannah Arendt’s notion of the banality of evil. The recent revival of this paradigm by American philosopher Susan Neiman, amongst others, pre-emptively alerts us to our own potential propensity for evil-doing by controversially shifting our focus from the subjectivity of victims to that of perpetrators whose psychological motives are often more similar to ours than we would care to acknowledge. Subverting the conventions of the typical Holocaust novel, Littell’s unique rehabilitation of Arendt’s theory through {{the voice of a}} former perpetrator as opposed to a victim elicits in his reader, especially through his semi-fictional portrayal of ‘ordinary’ real life Nazi Adolf Eichmann, a significant degree of moral self-interrogation that is lacking in standard approaches to this novel. Such approaches include the psychoanalytical theories of Julia Kristeva and Klaus Theweleits or the victim-based ‘ethics of the other’ endorsed by Claude Lanzmann, but denounced by Badiou. The chapter concludes with Littell’s pragmatic suggestion that the ancient Greek system of justice, which punishes evil acts rather than evil intentions, is the most appropriate response to the arbitrariness that is inherent to the banality of evil...|$|R
40|$|Background The tobacco {{epidemic}} {{is a global}} challenge demanding concerted global and national action. The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) contains the blueprint for coordinated global action to address {{one of the most}} significant risks to health. However, national action is critical in order to attain the vision embodied in the WHO FCTC. Building national capacity to carry out effective and sustainable national tobacco control programmes is an urgent priority, and one of the most important measures required to combat the tobacco epidemic. The idea of developing this Handbook arose from the awareness that while various official WHO documents called upon countries to develop national capacity for tobacco control, there was no comprehensive publication to guide them through the process of developing such capacity. Conceived as a “How to” manual, the approach is intentionally pragmatic, addressing ‘real world’ issues and providing practical advice for setting up viable national tobacco control programmes. Overview The Handbook contains three main sections. The Introduction presents the evolving definition of “national capacity”, identifies the types of capacities needed for effective tobacco control and outlines the key features of building capacity. Section 1 provides a descriptive overview of the tobacco epidemic. This section is divided into four chapters. These chapters address tobacco as a risk factor, presenting its health, social and economic costs; the global strategies of the tobacco industry to counteract public health measures; the scientific evidence for effective tobacco control interventions; and the WHO FCTC as a global solution to an epidemic with prominent politico-legal and socio-cultural attributes. Section 2 focuses on the fundamental capacities necessary to empower countries to control the tobacco epidemic successfully. These chapters apply the lessons learned from the experiences of different countries and offer advice and suggestions to enable countries to put the theories of tobacco control into practice. This section begins with the development of a national plan of action as the foundation for successful tobacco control at the country level. It addresses the other important elements in national capacity-building, including establishing an effective infrastructure for a national tobacco control programme, training and education, raising public awareness through effective communications and media advocacy, programming specific tobacco control activities, legislative measures for tobacco control and exploring economic interventions and funding initiatives. Finally, <b>chapters</b> on <b>countering</b> the tobacco industry, forming effective partnerships, monitoring and evaluating progress, and exchanging information and research provide valuable insights to improve tobacco control capacity. By sharing lessons learned from different countries and utilizing numerous examples, it is hoped that this Handbook will assist and inspire national governments to take on the challenge of reducing tobacco consumption and the related mortality and morbidity...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of civil disobedience, or protest against governmental actions and policies, {{has a long}} and varied history. This thesis examines the theories behind, and practice of the concept within a contemporary setting, namely {{from the middle of}} the nineteenth century to the present day. The central theme of the thesis is the extent to which violent actions may be regarded as justifiable means to be used within civil disobedience. Chapter One examines the terminology and interpretation of the phrase 'civil disobedience' itself in order to understand fully the linguistic context within which the discussions will be developed. Nonviolence is regarded most commonly as the sole, or at least primary demeanour to be adopted by civil disobedients. In Chapter Two this concept is considered from the point of view of both theorists and exponents of civil disobedience. Particular attention is paid to those criteria usually regarded as essential prerequisites for nonviolence. The concept of violence itself, within both a general political sense and within the narrower ambit of civil disobedience, is examined in Chapter Three, and this leads on to an analysis of the various arguments put forward for condemning the use of violence in <b>Chapter</b> Four. To <b>counter</b> those arguments, <b>Chapter</b> Five examines the leading theories which seek to provide some support or justification for the use of violent actions. One of the major criticisms levelled at contemporary civil disobedience, especially when violent methods are adopted, is that it has no place within modern 'Western democracies'. Consideration is given to the meaning of the conceptof 'democracy' in Chapter Six, and the jotential impact of available democratic pkocedures. for effectitig change are analysed. Chapter Seven applies the preceding analysis to two contemporary instances of civil disobedience, at Greenham Common and in Toxteth. The extent to which these actions can be supported or should be denounced are considered in this Chapter and in the Conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Fairy floss is pure sugar: {{watching}} someone conjure bolls of pink gossamer from a fairy floss {{machine is}} pure magic. If {{the production of}} confectionery is like alchemy, confectionery counters {{have the power to}} cast a spell upon young consumers and, furthermore, children’s consumption offers escape from the ordinary into the realm of the fabulous and enchanting. Because of this extraordinary appeal, confectionery is still synonymous with childhood, despite David Gillespie’s recent claim that sugar is Sweet Poison (2008), and it performs an ever-increasing number of roles in a multitude of spaces across the physical and cultural landscape of Australia. One might assume that the appeal of confectionery is simply gustatory, but confectionery has more in common with fairytales than food. This is a thesis about lollies, an Australian term for the cheap sugar confectionery bought mostly by children. In particular, it examines the role lollies played in Australian childhood throughout the twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries. By repositioning sugar confectionery as magic, it challenges dominant narratives of devaluation and demonisation that reduce the complexity of lollies and their cultural significance. I propose that the social world is made up of two separate and hierarchical domains—the ordinary world and the magical world—and that lollies belong to the latter, a proposition based on Emile Durkheim’s two-world model. Mikhail Bakhtin’s carnivalesque “second world” (6) corresponds with children’s experience of lollies as magic and reveals the subversive potential of confectionery because it inverts hierarchical norms, thereby elevating coarse laughter, food throwing, and the grotesque body. After first developing the idea of a magical world, this thesis employs five magic tropes from popular literary story lands to explore five aspects of the power that lollies exert over, and bestow upon, children. Using Wonderland as a food model for {{the early decades of the}} twentieth century, Chapters Two and Three link the power of lollies to deprivation and to the jewel-like spectacle of the lolly <b>counter.</b> <b>Chapter</b> Four explores the use of lollies as toys, especially in the postwar period, when the expanding world of children’s entertainment paralleled the lands above Enid Blyton’s Faraway Tree. The child as consumer is then examined: since lollies are cheap, they give children their first taste of consumer power and demonstrate children’s sophistication and influence in the marketplace. Finally, I explore the subversive nature of lollies and the disgust produced by the violation of food norms, both increasingly evident toward the end of the century. Lollies are simultaneously enchanting and empowering. As magical objects in an ordinary world, they represent luxury, beauty, fun, consumer power, and subversive pleasure as well as gustatory adventure...|$|R
40|$|Targeted killing, {{particularly}} {{through the}} use of missiles fired from Predator drone aircraft, has become an important, and internationally controversial, part of the US war against al Qaeda in Pakistan and other places. The Obama administration, both during the campaign and in its first months in office, has publicly embraced the strategy as a form of counterterrorism. This chapter argues, however, that unless the Obama administration takes careful and assertive legal steps to protect it, targeted killing using remote platforms such as drone aircraft will take on greater strategic salience precisely as the Obama administration allows the legal space for it in international law to shrink. Moreover, the chapter argues that non-state enemies of the United States will not always be al Qaeda or groups covered by Security Council resolutions or the US Authorization for the Use of Military Force. Eventually there will emerge other threats that do not fall within the existing armed conflicts, and the United States is likely to seek to address at least some of those threats using its inherent rights of self-defense, whether or not a conflict within the meaning of international humanitarian law (IHL) and its thresholds is underway, and using domestic law authority under the statutes establishing the CIA. In that case, a US administration seeking to offer a legal rationale justifying its use of targeted killing might discover that reliance upon a state of IHL-armed conflict does not provide it the robust authority to use force that the US has traditionally asserted under its rights of inherent self-defense. The author offers blunt advice to the Obama administration and the US Congress with a particular normative goal in mind - to preserve the legal rationales for the use of self-defense in targeted killing, whether or not an IHL armed conflict is underway, consistent with the positions taken by the United States in the 1980 s, and culminating with a statement of the US position on self-defense against terrorism and targeting terrorists in third-state safe havens by then-State Department legal advisor Abraham Sofaer in 1989. The point of the paper is to urge the Obama administration, and offer it advice, on how to preserve the legal category of targeted killing as an aspect of inherent rights of self-defense and US domestic law. As such, the <b>chapter</b> runs sharply <b>counter</b> to the dominant trend in international law scholarship, which is overwhelmingly hostile to the practice. It urges the Obama administration to consider carefully ways in which apparently unrelated, broadly admirable human rights goals, such as accepting extraterritorial application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, or accepting its standards as a complement to the lex specialis of IHL, or accepting recent soft-law standards offered by some influential NGOs such as the International Committee of the Red Cross to define 2 ̆ 2 direct participation in hostilities, 2 ̆ 2 have the effect of making legally difficult, if not legally impossible, a counterterrorism strategy of targeted killing using standoff platforms that the Obama administration has correctly embraced as both more effective and more discriminating from a humanitarian stance. It is frank, practical advice to the Obama administration that it must assert the legality of its practices {{in the face of a}} hostile and influential international soft-law community or risk losing the legal rationale for a signature strategy.
