5|$|Carol {{had been}} in {{development}} since 1997, when Nagy wrote {{the first draft of}} the screenplay. British company Film4 Productions and its then-chief executive Tessa Ross financed development. The film had a troubled development period, facing problems with financing, rights, scheduling conflicts, and accessibility. Number 9 Films <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> as a producer in 2011, when co-founder Elizabeth Karlsen secured the rights to the novel. The film is co-produced by New York-based Killer Films, which joined the project when co-founder and Haynes's collaborator Christine Vachon approached Haynes to direct in 2013. Principal photography began in March 2014, in Cincinnati, Ohio, and lasted 34 days. Cinematographer Edward Lachman shot Carol on Super 16 mm film.|$|E
5|$|Murphy and DeSanto {{developed}} {{the project in}} 2003, and DeSanto wrote a treatment. Steven Spielberg <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the following year, hiring Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman to write the screenplay. The U.S. Armed Forces and General Motors (GM) loaned vehicles and aircraft during filming, which saved money for the production and added realism to the battle scenes. Hasbro's promotional campaign for the film included deals with various companies; advertising included a viral marketing campaign, coordinated releases of , , and books, as well as product placement deals with companies such as GM, Burger King, and eBay.|$|E
5|$|Snyder {{hoped to}} have {{principal}} photography take place from JuneSeptember 2007, but filming was delayed until September 17, 2007. Snyder wanted a $150 million budget, but Warner Bros. preferred the budget remain under $100 million; the film ultimately finished with a budget of approximately $120 million. The production took place in Vancouver, where a New York City back lot was built. Sound stages were used for apartments and offices, while sequences on Mars and Antarctica were shot against green screens. Ten visual effects companies, Sony Pictures Imageworks and Intelligent Creatures among them, <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> {{to work on the}} film, which ended up having 1,100 shots featuring effects, a quarter of them being computer-generated imagery.|$|E

5|$|The first festival {{was held}} in 1974, {{organised}} by Royce Creasey and friends, as a small event, for the local musicians to entertain the local community. The first festival took place over four successive weekends with bands playing from a stage improvised from a flat bed truck. Bristol City Council donated £50. The following year the festival took place over one weekend and was located near to Ashton Court mansion. After this, new organisers <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and fund-raising gigs were held enabling the event to grow steadily through the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the film were derived from Reiner's return to single life after a divorce. An {{interview}} Ephron conducted with Reiner {{provided the basis for}} Harry. Sally was based on Ephron and some of her friends. Crystal <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and made his own contributions to the screenplay, making Harry funnier. Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. The soundtrack consists of standards performed by Harry Connick Jr., with a big band and orchestra arranged by Marc Shaiman. Connick won his first Grammy Award for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance.|$|E
5|$|Jim Thompson {{was hired}} by Foster and McQueen to adapt his novel. He worked on the {{screenplay}} for four months, changing some of the scenes and episodes in his novel. Thompson's script included the borderline surrealistic ending from his novel featuring El Rey, an imaginary Mexican town filled with criminals. McQueen objected to the depressing ending and Thompson was replaced by screenwriter Walter Hill. Hill had been recommended by Polly Platt, Bogdanovich's wife, who was then still attached to direct; Platt had been impressed by Hill's work on Hickey & Boggs (1972). Hill said Bogdanovich wanted to turn the material into a more Hitchcock-type thriller, but he had only gotten twenty-five pages in when McQueen fired the director. Hill finished the script in six weeks, then Peckinpah <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E

5|$|Peter Bogdanovich, whose The Last Picture Show {{impressed}} McQueen {{and producer}} David Foster, was originally hired {{as the director}} of The Getaway. Thompson <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> to write the script of his crime novel's film adaptation. Creative differences ensued between Thompson and McQueen and the author was fired along with Bogdanovichthey were replaced with Hill and Peckinpah. Principal photography commenced on February 7, 1972, on location in Texas. During production, McQueen and MacGraw began an affair, and McQueen and Peckinpah were involved in heated arguments due to the latter's increasing alcohol intake. Originally scored by Peckinpah collaborator Jerry Fielding, McQueen became unimpressed with Fielding's soundtrack and, at his behest, hired Quincy Jones to rescore it. Jones was later nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for his work.|$|E
5|$|In early 1938, both Jefferey and Cooper {{were sent}} back to Britain {{as part of the}} crew rotation. While docked in Hankou, Judy took a liking to another Pointer on board a French gunboat Francis Garnier. The two ship's {{companies}} held an impromptu wedding ceremony for the two dogs. The French Pointer, Paul, remained on the Gnat for three days before returning to his ship. Judy fell pregnant, and gave birth to thirteen puppies. Ten of them survived and were eventually given away to a variety of sources including the Francis Garnier and the American gunboat USS Guam. Judy was involved in an incident in October that year that resulted in the ending of her trips ashore in Hankou. Whilst being walked by two sailors from the Gnat, they were confronted by Japanese soldiers who pointed a loaded rifle at Judy. One of the soldiers was thrown into the Yangtze River by Leading Seaman Jack Law in response. During the following days, several Japanese officers <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the Gnat and it was decided {{that it would be better}} for Judy to stay on the ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} {{by a team}} consisting of Motoi Sakuraba, Yuzo Koshiro, Masafumi Takada, Noriyuki Iwadare, Takahiro Nishi, and Yasunori Mitsuda. Nishi acted as the music director, while orchestration was handled by Mitsuda and his studio assistant Natsumi Kameoka. Early in the game's development, Sakurai and Nishi were in discussions about what the style of Uprisings music would be, and which composers to hire for it. The composers were those who had contributed most prominently to Super Smash Bros. Brawl. The music involved both live orchestral music, synthesized tracks, and tracks that combined both musical styles. The air battle themes were created to match the dialogue and action on-screen, which was stated early on {{to be an important}} goal. Another aspect of the music, as noted by Koshiro, was that it should stand out while not interfering with dialogue. Sakuraba and Koshiro were brought in fairly early, and thus encountered difficulties with creating their music. Sakuraba recalled that he needed to rewrite the opening theme multiple times after his first demo clashed with the footage he saw due to his not knowing much about the game's world. Takada <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> when there was an ample amount of footage, but was shocked when he saw gameplay from the game's fifth chapter and tried to create suitable music within Sakurai's guidelines.|$|E

5|$|The {{previous}} {{title in}} the series, Fire Emblem Awakening, was planned {{to be the last}} in the series due to decreasing sales. The game was a worldwide commercial success, prompting Nintendo to greenlight a new entry. Fates was co-developed by regular Fire Emblem developer Intelligent Systems and Nintendo SPD, with the main staff of Awakening returning to their respective roles for Fates: they were Intelligence System's Kouhei Maeda as director, Nintendo SPD director Genki Yokota, Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami, art director Toshiyuki Kusakihara, and character designer Yūsuke Kozaki. Yokota's work on the game ran parallel with his work on Xenoblade Chronicles X. Masahiro Higuchi, Awakenings project manager, <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> as a producer. According to the original staff, the request for a sequel was a shock as they had all developed Awakening assuming it would be the last in the series. During its early design stages, Fates was given the working title Fire Emblem 3DS II. The game's cutscenes were animated by Studio Anima, while storyboarding was handled by Spooky Graphic. To develop the multiple versions, one core team worked on the game's shared assets, while additional teams handled individual level design.|$|E
5|$|By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put {{the serial}} into {{production}} and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, “Compassionate Leave”, depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as “the most sustained evocation of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember”. The budget was set at £2 million, of which £400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International. Director Martin Campbell <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular {{to the notion that}} Craven had known about Emma's involvement with GAIA right from the start; this was removed at Campbell's behest. Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that “it didn't seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't {{be able to make it}} work for the audience”, a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was “likely not to come off as an effect”. Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, “Burden of Proof”, the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.|$|E

25|$|Officers {{came and}} went just as the crew members did. PC-552 was allotted five {{officers}}, a CO, an XO, and three watch officers. Sometimes the watch officers had special duties such as gunnery officer or communications officer, sometimes they didn't. Patrol craft were informal. Many of the officers were promoted on the ship. For example, Lt. Moll <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> as the XO, rated LTJG; {{he was promoted to}} CO. Future executive officers, LTJG T.F. Finucane and LTJG W.J.
