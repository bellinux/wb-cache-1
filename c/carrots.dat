5|$|<b>Carrots</b> can {{be eaten}} {{in a variety}} of ways. Only 3 percent of the β-carotene in raw <b>carrots</b> is {{released}} during digestion: this can be improved to 39% by pulping, cooking and adding cooking oil. Alternatively they may be chopped and boiled, fried or steamed, and cooked in soups and stews, as well as baby and pet foods. A well-known dish is <b>carrots</b> julienne. Together with onion and celery, <b>carrots</b> are one of the primary vegetables used in a mirepoix to make various broths.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, baby <b>carrots</b> or mini-carrots (<b>carrots</b> {{that have been}} {{peeled and cut into}} uniform cylinders) have been a popular ready-to-eat snack food {{available}} in many supermarkets. <b>Carrots</b> are puréed and used as baby food, dehydrated to make chips, flakes, and powder, and thinly sliced and deep-fried, like potato chips.|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{overnight}} <b>carrot</b> {{broth culture}} using the BD GeneOhm StrepB assay (<b>carrot</b> broth-enhanced PCR) yields increased sensitivity {{compared to that}} of <b>carrot</b> broth culture alone for the detection of Streptococcus agalactiae. We investigated the prospect of reducing the <b>carrot</b> broth incubation time prior to PCR performance. In vitro experimentation demonstrated that <b>carrot</b> broth-enhanced PCR nominally detected 10 CFU S. agalactiae after 4 h of <b>carrot</b> broth incubation with competitive flora. Detection rates improved with inocula of 100 and 1, 000 CFU S. agalactiae, with the majority of these aliquots demonstrating detection after 2 h of <b>carrot</b> broth incubation. <b>Carrot</b> broth was prospectively inoculated with clinical vaginal/anorectal swabs, with 500 -μl aliquots collected. Early aliquots from 227 specimens were subjected to <b>carrot</b> broth-enhanced PCR (early-aliquot <b>carrot</b> broth-enhanced PCR) in instances of subsequent positive <b>carrot</b> broth culture or positive overnight clinical <b>carrot</b> broth-enhanced PCR. The S. agalactiae detection rate by early-aliquot <b>carrot</b> broth-enhanced PCR (66. 1 %) exceeded that observed for 227 remnant swabs retrospectively tested by direct swab PCR (56. 4 %; P = 0. 03). Early-aliquot <b>carrot</b> broth-enhanced PCR detection rate differences were most pronounced in aliquots from 83 <b>carrot</b> broth aliquots collected after 6 h (84. 3 %) compared to detection rates from either direct swab PCR of these samples (51. 8 %; P < 0. 0002) or early-aliquot <b>carrot</b> broth-enhanced PCR of 144 <b>carrot</b> broth aliquots collected after fewer than 6 h of incubation (55. 6 %; P < 0. 0002). Enhanced sensitivity of early-aliquot <b>carrot</b> broth-enhanced PCR versus direct swab PCR suggests that this assay could serve as a surrogate rapid detection method facilitating the prevention of group B streptococcal disease...|$|R

5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. Carrot juice and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be run through a sieve to strain it. The <b>carrots</b> used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled <b>carrots</b> can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions of the dish. Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the <b>carrots</b> used. Young <b>carrots</b> tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger <b>carrots</b> provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked <b>carrots</b> that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carrots</b> {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root fly, and other vegetables that team well with <b>carrots</b> include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. <b>Carrots</b> thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E
5|$|In India <b>carrots</b> {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} ways, as salads or as {{vegetables}} added to spicy rice or dal dishes. A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has <b>carrots</b> grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added. Carrot salads are usually made with grated <b>carrots</b> with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil. <b>Carrots</b> can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.|$|E

5|$|Polyacetylenes can {{be found}} in Apiaceae {{vegetables}} like <b>carrots</b> where they show cytotoxic activities. Falcarinol and falcarindiol (cis-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diyne-3,8-diol) are such compounds.

5|$|The {{provitamin}} A beta-carotene from <b>carrots</b> {{does not}} actually help {{people to see}} in the dark unless they suffer from a deficiency of vitamin A. This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology and the use of red lights on instrument panels. Nevertheless, the consumption of <b>carrots</b> was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use <b>carrots</b> in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food. The British public during WWII generally believed that eating <b>carrots</b> would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000 ton surplus of <b>carrots</b> from the extra production.|$|E
5|$|The {{sweetness}} of <b>carrots</b> allows the vegetable {{to be used}} in some fruit-like roles. Grated <b>carrots</b> are used in carrot cakes, as well as carrot puddings, an English dish thought to have originated in the early 19th century. <b>Carrots</b> can also be used alone or blended with fruits in jams and preserves. Carrot juice is also widely marketed, especially as a health drink, either stand-alone or blended with juices extracted from fruits and other vegetables.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Carrot</b> is a {{frequent}} cause of food allergy in Europe. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate a panel of <b>carrot</b> allergens for diagnosis of <b>carrot</b> allergy in Spain, Switzerland and Denmark. METHODS: Forty-nine <b>carrot</b> allergic patients, 71 pollen allergic but carrot-tolerant patients and 63 nonatopic controls were included. Serum IgE to <b>carrot</b> extract, recombinant <b>carrot</b> allergens (rDau c 1. 0104; rDau c 1. 0201; rDau c 4; the isoflavone reductase-like proteins rDau c IFR 1, rDau c IFR 2; the <b>carrot</b> cyclophilin rDau c Cyc) were analyzed by ImmunoCAP. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the <b>carrot</b> extract-based test was 82 %. Use of the recombinant allergens increased the sensitivity to 90 %. The Dau c 1 isoforms were major allergens for Swiss and Danish <b>carrot</b> allergic patients, the profilin rDau c 4 for the Spanish patients. The rDau c IFR 1 and rDau c IFR 2 were recognized by 6 % and 20 % of the <b>carrot</b> allergics, but did not contribute to a further increase of sensitivity. Among pollen allergic controls, 34 % had IgE to <b>carrot</b> extract, 18 % to each of rDau c 1. 0104, rDau c 1. 0201 and rDau c 4, 8 % to rDau c IFR 1 and 7 % to rDau c IFR 2. Sensitization to rDau c Cyc occurred in one <b>carrot</b> allergic patient and one nonatopic control. CONCLUSION: Component-resolved in vitro analyses revealed a significant difference in IgE sensitization pattern between geographical regions and in the prevalence of sensitization to <b>carrot</b> components between <b>carrot</b> allergic and carrot-tolerant but pollen sensitized patients...|$|R

5|$|<b>Carrots</b> {{are one of}} the ten most {{economically}} important vegetable {{crops in}} the world. In 2014, world production of <b>carrots</b> (combined with turnips) was 38.8 million tonnes, with China producing 45% of the world total (17.3 million tonnes, table).
