5|$|Since then, Clinton {{has been}} {{assigned}} {{a number of other}} diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009. In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti's recovery. Clinton continues to visit Haiti to witness the inauguration of refugee villages, and to raise funds for victims of the earthquake. In 2010, <b>Clinton</b> <b>announced</b> support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of NTR, Ireland's first environmental foundation. At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, <b>Clinton</b> <b>announced</b> {{that she}} would seek a second Senate term. Clinton easily won the Democratic {{nomination}} over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini. The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance. Clinton's eventual opponent {{in the general election}} was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67percent of the vote to Spencer's 31percent, carrying all but four of New York's sixty-two counties. Her campaign spent $36 million for her re-election, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008. In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.|$|E
5|$|Based on his philanthropic worldview, Clinton {{created the}} William J. Clinton Foundation {{to address issues}} of global importance. This {{foundation}} includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and {{has worked with the}} Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict. In 2005, <b>Clinton</b> <b>announced</b> through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools. Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative. The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East. In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30percent in developing nations. Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.|$|E

5|$|The {{end of the}} Cambodian {{conflict}} {{also brought}} an end the ASEAN-imposed trade and aid embargo which had been in place since 1979. In January 1990, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan publicly voiced his support for Vietnam, {{and the rest of}} Indochina, to gain admission into ASEAN. In the period between late 1991 and early 1992, Vietnam restored relations with several member nations of ASEAN. As a result, between 1991 and 1994, investments from ASEAN countries made up 15 percent of direct foreign investment in Vietnam. Aside from the obvious economic benefits, ASEAN also provided a peaceful environment that guaranteed Vietnam's national security against foreign threats in the post-Cold War era, when Soviet aid was no longer available. Thus, on 28 July 1995, Vietnam officially became the seventh member of ASEAN, after leading ASEAN officials invited Vietnam to join at the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Bangkok in 1994. Then, in August 1995, the U.S. Liaison Office in Hanoi was upgraded to Embassy status, after U.S. President Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>announced</b> a formal normalisation of diplomatic relations with Vietnam on 11 July 1995, thereby ending Vietnam’s isolation from the United States.|$|E

Obama announced his candidacy on February 10 in his home state of Illinois. None of the candidates received a significant bounce in their poll numbers after their official announcements. Through most of 2007, even after it was evident that Al Gore would not run, he and Edwards each hovered between the third and fourth place spots in the polls behind Clinton and Obama.|$|E
25|$|On June 28, 2009, President Manuel Zelaya {{was arrested}} and exiled from the country. Obama {{condemned}} the action and described the event as a coup.

25|$|Hagan {{had been}} the target of {{numerous}} negative ads paid for by Americans for Prosperity, which had spent over $7 million on the race by the end of March 2014. As part of a $3 million offensive effort against those efforts in early 2014, the Senate Majority PAC released ads supporting Hagan. In July 2014, Hagan had the largest cash-on-hand advantage of any vulnerable Democratic senator. She was endorsed by Vice President Joe Biden. In September 2014, Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>announced</b> plans to campaign for Hagan. Hagan faced Republican Thom Tillis and Libertarian Sean Haugh in the general election on Tuesday, November 4. Hagan declined to participate in a scheduled October 21 debate. She was a speaker at the state AFL-CIO convention. After a close race, Kay Hagan lost her bid for re-election by roughly 45,000 votes, or by 1.5%.|$|E
25|$|U.S. President Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>announced</b> his {{invitation}} to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat on 5 July 2000, {{to come to}} Camp David, Maryland, {{in order to continue}} their negotiations on the Middle East peace process. There was a hopeful precedent in the 1978 Camp David Accords where President Jimmy Carter was able to broker a peace agreement between Egypt, represented by President Anwar Sadat, and Israel represented by Prime Minister Menachem Begin. The Oslo Accords of 1993 between the later assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat had provided that agreement should be reached on all outstanding issues between the Palestinians and Israeli sides – the so-called final status settlement – within five years of the implementation of Palestinian autonomy. However, the interim process put in place under Oslo had fulfilled neither Israeli nor Palestinian expectations.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} week, {{it became clear}} that a tie on Super Tuesday left Obama better positioned for the upcoming contests in February, where the demographics of several large states seemed to favor him. The day after Super Tuesday, February 6, <b>Clinton</b> <b>announced</b> that she had personally lent her campaign $5 million in January. The news came as a surprise and set off another round of news stories about Clinton donors and supporters concerned about the campaign's strategy. It was particularly striking in contrast to Obama's announcement that he had raised a record-high $32 million in January, tapping 170,000 new contributors. It became clear that Obama's financial advantage had allowed him to organize and compete in a broader set of states on Super Tuesday, an advantage likely to continue in the coming weeks and months. Clinton's supporters responded by raising $6 million online in 36 hours, but Obama's campaign upped the ante, announcing their own total of $7.5 million in 36 hours and starting a new goal of reaching 500,000 new contributors in 2008 by the end of February.|$|E

500|$|During the campaign, {{questions}} of {{conflict of interest}} regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay. Further concern arose when Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>announced</b> that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents [...] "for the price of one".|$|E
500|$|Clinton {{flew back}} to Washington, D.C. from his {{vacation}} at Martha's Vineyard, speaking with legislators from Air Force One, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and Sharif from the White House. <b>Clinton</b> <b>announced</b> the attacks in a TV address, saying the Khost camp was [...] "one {{of the most active}} terrorist bases in the world." [...] He emphasized that [...] "Our battle against terrorism... will require strength, courage and endurance. We will not yield to this threat... We must be prepared to do all that we can for as long as we must." [...] Clinton also cited [...] "compelling evidence that [...] was planning to mount further attacks" [...] in his rationale for Operation Infinite Reach.|$|E
500|$|Maloney drew {{criticism}} {{for the fact}} that he bought a house in Cold Spring before the election, never having previously lived in the district. On June 11, former President Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>announced</b> his endorsement of Maloney, saying [...] "I support Sean because I know he’ll be an outstanding member of Congress." [...] On October 21, The New York Times endorsed Maloney, stating that his opponent [...] "has favored limiting contraception coverage for employees and voted to defund Planned Parenthood. Mr. Maloney promises to support health care reform, help the middle class and oppose tax cuts for the rich. We recommend Mr. Maloney." [...] Maloney also was endorsed by Planned Parenthood, and the AFL-CIO and New York State United Teachers Union.|$|E
