40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} Medicare rebate claim trends under the Australian Chronic Disease Dental Scheme (CDDS) over time, region and type of service. Methods: CDDS data obtained from the Department of Human Services reflected all Medicare item claims lodged under the CDDS by dental practitioners and processed by Medicare. Retrospective analysis of CDDS rebate claims was conducted. Results: The CDDS rebates for the period 2008 – 13 totalled A$ 2. 8 billion. Just under 81 % of claims were from dental practitioners working in major cities. The most frequent rebates were for <b>crown,</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> implant (32. 4 %), removable prostheses (22. 4 %) and restorative services (21. 3 %). The rebate claims of restorative services, <b>crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge,</b> <b>and</b> removable <b>prostheses</b> per dentist in all regional areas increased over the time of the CDDS. Per capita, the rebates for every type of dental service were lower in the more remote regions. Conclusions: Rebate claims increased in each of the last 3 full years of the CDDS across all areas. The majority of Medicare rebate claims were from major city areas <b>and</b> for <b>crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge,</b> removable <b>prostheses</b> <b>and</b> restorative services. The service mix varied between regions. Leonard A. Crocombe, Jennifer Kraatz, Ha Hoang, Daiyi Qin and Diana Godwi...|$|R
40|$|The maxillofacial {{region is}} one of the most injury-prone areas during road traffic accidents, {{personal}} violence, falls and sports. Maxillofacial trauma can lead to breakage or avulsion of upper anterior teeth, which may cause significant aesthetic and functional problems. There are many treatment options available for rehabilitation including removable partial dentures, fixed partial dentures, <b>crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> implant-supported <b>prostheses.</b> Herein, two cases are presented where implant placement was done for upper anterior teeth, which were traumatized or avulsed following maxillofacial trauma. Both patients demonstrated a history of maxillofacial trauma and had undergone open reduction and internal fixation. The first patient had a severe maxillary alveolar defect treated via autogenous bone grafting and a six-month period was given for proper integration of the bone graft. The second patient was a smoker with very poor oral hygiene and a deep bite. Thus, implant placement was not initially justified. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Ni-Cr-Mo alloys {{are used}} as the {{alternative}} for the cobalt alloys {{in the manufacture of}} metal prosthetic elements, i. e. <b>crowns,</b> <b>bridges</b> <b>and</b> frame <b>prostheses.</b> The article attempts at a materials science characterization of the nickel-based alloy of the commercial name Argeloy N.

Observations of the microstructure were performed with the use of optical and electron scanning microscopy. Also, X-ray structural tests were conducted as well as corrosion resistance tests in an artificial saliva solution (pH = 6, 7). It was demonstrated that the examined Ni- 22 Cr- 9 Mo alloy characterized in a dendritic structure typical of the cast materials. The X-ray qualitative phase analysis revealed the phase γ'(Ni) in both examined materials, as well as the presence of Cr 23 C 6 type carbides and Nb 2 C, Ta 2 C (commercial alloy) and NbC, Ta 4 C 0, 04 (cast alloy) phases.

40|$|<b>Crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> {{have life}} span of many years but they fail {{for a number of}} reasons. Over the years, many devices have been {{designed}} to remove <b>crowns</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges</b> from abutment teeth. While the removal of temporary <b>crowns</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges</b> is usually very straightforward, the removal of a definitive cast crown with unknown cement is more challenging. Removal is often by destructive means. There are a number of circumstances, however, in which conservative disassembly would aid the practitioner in completing restorative/endodontic procedures. There are different mechanisms available to remove a failed crown or bridge. But there is no information published about the classification of available systems for <b>crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> removal. So it is logical to classify these systems into different groups which can help a clinician in choosing a particular type of system depending upon the clinical situation. The aim {{of this article is to}} provide a classification for various <b>crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> removal systems; describe how a number of systems work; and when and why they might be used. A PubMed search of English literature was conducted up to January 2010 using the terms: <b>Crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> removal, <b>Crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> disassembly, <b>Crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> failure.

40|$|Impression {{techniques}} for implant restorations can be implant level or abutment level impressions with open tray or closed tray techniques. Conventional implant-abutment level impression techniques are predictable for maximizing esthetic outcomes. Restoration of the implant traditionally requires {{the use of}} the metal or plastic impression copings, analogs, and laboratory components. Simplifying the dental implant restoration by reducing armamentarium through incorporating conventional techniques used daily for <b>crowns</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges</b> will allow more general dentists to restore implants in their practices. The demonstrated technique is useful when modifications to implant abutments are required to correct the angulation of malpositioned implants. This technique utilizes conventional <b>crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> impression techniques. As an added benefit, it reduces costs by utilizing techniques used daily for <b>crowns</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges.</b> The aim of this report is to describe a simplified conventional impression technique for custom abutments and modified prefabricated solid abutments for definitive restorations...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} to {{investigate}} the quality of <b>crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> work among dental practitioners (DP's) in Khartoum state by mean of a questionnaire. This was distributed to 230 individual DP's who work in private clinics or primary health care centers in Khartoum state. A total of 152 completed questionnaire forms were collected, giving a response rate of 66. 09 %. The <b>crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> work was mainly done in private practice (80. 92 %) in comparison to primary health care centers (19. 08 %). Thirty two percent and 38. 1 % of the surveyed DP's never or rarely used study casts respectively. The surveyed DP's often (40. 94 %) and rarely (35. 57 %) use radiographs for the <b>crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> work. Vitality test of abutment teeth was never (45. 64 %) or rarely (22. 82 %) done by the majority of the surveyed DP's. High-speed hand pieces were the instrument of choice in 80. 54 % of the responses. The most common used hand pieces according to number of spray ports were found to be the single port (80. 43 %). Impression materials used by surveyed DP's were as follow: additional cured-silicone 7. 32 %, condensationcured silicone 24. 32 % and alginate 68. 24 %. The putty and wash technique was the most recommended technique for those who used silicone impression material (80. 85 %). Impression trays used by DP's were: metal 23. 53 %, rigid plastic 12. 5 % and both 63. 97 %. Results in relation {{to the use of the}} retracting cord indicated that 53. 69 % never use it, while 9. 4 % always used it in their practice. Disinfection of the impression was not routine. Wax was the most commonly used interocclusal recording material (94. 34 %). Both verbal and written prescriptions (81. 73 %) was the most common way of communication between DP's and dental technicians. Results also showed that 36. 05 % never used temporary restorations before cementation of the definite restorations. Traditional glass ionomer cements and zinc phosphate cements were the most commonly selected material for the luting <b>crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> restorations. It is concluded from the present investigation that the majority of the surveyed DP's rarely used study casts and radiographs for the abutment teeth. 6 It is also, concluded that alginate was the main impression material used for <b>crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> work.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the color stability and flexural strength of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and bis-acrylic composite based provisional <b>crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> auto-polymerizing resins exposed to tea, coffee, cola, and food dye. Materials and Methods: Two provisional <b>crown</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> resins, one DPI self-cure tooth molding powder (PMMA) (Group A), and one Protemp 4 Temporization Material (bis-acrylic composite) (Group B) were used. Disk-shaped specimens for color stability testing (n = 30 for each material) and bar-shaped specimens for flexural strength testing (n = 30 for each material) were fabricated using a metal mold. The specimens were immersed in artificial saliva, artificial saliva + tea, artificial saliva + coffee, artificial saliva + cola, and artificial saliva + food dye solutions {{and stored in}} an incubator at 37 °C. Color measurements were taken before immersion, and then after 3 and 7 days of immersion. Flexural strength was evaluated after 7 days of immersion.
