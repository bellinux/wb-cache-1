[...] "We {{have made the}} decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in The Avengers," [...] stated Feige. [...] "Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and <b>collaborative</b> <b>spirit</b> of our other talented cast members.

[...] In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it [...] "purposefully misleading" [...] and an [...] "inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light". In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be associated with only one character.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies show}} that {{students}} of various grade levels report the Genetics as an abstract theme and difficult to assimilate by the students, with multiple problems in the teaching-learning process and becoming necessary the development of auxiliary practices. Among the teaching tools, the game is the most currently opted playful activity by stimulating multiple intelligences, allowing greater student-teacher interaction. This work seeks the production of an innovative and dynamic educational game, Twister Protein, as a pedagogical resource for Genetics discipline. The development of the game {{was based on the}} use of easily accessible and low cost materials by teachers, allowing the knowledge of transcription, translation and protein folding. The activity was proposed and applied in the classroom with pilot undergraduate students. The fun associated with the knowledge of science not only allowed a better memorization of the content addressed, as aroused the curiosity, theme reflection, character building and <b>collaborative</b> <b>spirits,</b> as well as competitiveness through the interaction between class. This practice proved to be an effective tool in the escape from routine and fault repair of the theoretical process...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{leadership}} gap on the African continent {{that requires the}} development of leaders that can help to transform society by bringing together government, civil society, and business. This study explores the relationship between reflexivity, scholarship programs {{and the development of}} transformational leadership identities and why they are needed to advance positive social impact on the African continent. By examining South African and African scholarship recipients this study focuses on the development of transformational leadership from the perspective of business schools and demonstrates how scholarship initiatives are able to cultivate scholars' ability to think more consciously and innovatively about complex societal issues. The findings indicate that scholarship initiatives and networks, both new and more established, provide an important space for exchange, critical reflection, and self-development. The reflexive practices that emerge during scholarship initiatives act as a catalyst for building the leadership identities of the scholars. These reflexive spaces offer a unique opportunity for scholars to become more self-aware of their capacity and their potential as leaders but more importantly allows for deep conversations and shared meaning-making, which results in shared leadership identities and stronger <b>collaborative</b> <b>spirits.</b> The study offers insights on how transformational leaders are shaped and influenced and how the process of developing transformational leadership as a collective occurs. In addition, this research offers recommendations on how to strengthen the scholarship platform and encourage reflexive practices {{to meet the needs of}} future scholars, business leaders, entrepreneurs and social innovators...|$|R

40|$|The New Zealand early {{childhood}} curriculum, Te Whāriki (Ministry of Education [MoE], 1996), is frequently {{hailed as a}} community inspired curriculum, praised nationally and internationally for its <b>collaborative</b> development, emancipatory <b>spirit</b> and bicultural approach. In its best form community can be collaborative, consultative, democratic, responsive and inclusive. But community and collaboration can also be about exclusion, alienation and loss. This paper engages with Te Whāriki as a contestable political document. It explores this much acclaimed {{early childhood}} curriculum within a politics of community, collaboration and control. Driving {{the direction of the}} paper is a call for a revitalised understanding of curriculum as practices of freedom, raising issues of how to work with difference and complexity in a democratic and ethical manner. The paper concludes that although official curriculum is unavoidably about control, there is a world of difference in the ways such control might be exercised. The real curriculum exists where teachers are working with children - it is in the everyday micro-practices that impacts are felt and freedoms played out...|$|R
40|$|We live in {{interesting}} times. While {{people have}} been “making ” things for quite a while, {{the last few years}} has seen the emergence of a distinctive maker and DIY (“do-it-yourself ”) culture all around the world. One interesting facet of the maker culture is its pervasiveness. One does not need a PhD or professional license {{to be a part of}} this culture. It is pop culture at its finest! The cost of building a small, interesting robot today is really only a few hundred US dollars. A decent 3 D printer can be built for under five hundred (not including ink). There are reasonable digital oscilloscopes that fit inside a watch or plug inside your PC. The precipitous drop in cost of materials and equipment, along with the widespread dissemination of knowledge via low barrier mediums like online videos and the web have all had a hand in making “DIY ” easier than ever before. At the heart of the maker world is a <b>collaborative</b> community <b>spirit,</b> whether it is about sharing designs, working collaboratively in a shared space (a. k. a. “hackerspaces”), raising funds from a broad community of interest, or showing off your cool project at venues such as Makerfaire. The community of makers utilizes traditional manufacturing techniques (e. g., wood- and metal-working). The special twist is that one does not need to go through an apprenticeship process and commit to years of study along with a vocation. Rather, one can simply find the closest hackerspace and join up or organize a course on PCB (“Printed Circuit Board”) design, soldering, or forging pendants by melting discarded coke cans. In addition, there are some enabling technologies – single board microcontrollers and 3 D printers- that became popular among the hobbyist communities over the last few years. These are distinct faces of the maker community. Finally, there are a plethora of applications that the maker community is interested in. This changes over time but recently, there is great interest in small robots, flying drones and quantifying one’s daily routines and habits. In this piece, we’ll be exploring some of these broad trends...|$|R

50|$|Another {{source of}} strain {{was the way}} the {{training}} of faculty was programmed. During the duration of the project, over fifty Cameroonian professionals received graduate training. Sending so many (almost half of UCD staff) for long-term studies put a huge burden on the remaining faculty and students. Only the strong <b>collaborative</b> <b>spirit</b> of the remaining faculty - American, Belgium, Cameroonian, and French - and the use to teaching assistants from external institutions saw UCD through the difficult time.

50|$|The Knights are a New York-based orchestra. While music {{students}} in the late 1990s, brothers Eric and Colin Jacobsen began regular informal chamber music readings at their home, inviting friends with a shared enthusiasm for the discovery and performance of new and historical music.

50|$|As an {{embodiment}} of the true <b>collaborative</b> <b>spirit,</b> {{over the last two}} decades, Dr. Soloway has worked closely in tandem with a former resident and co-faculty member, Dr. Gaetano Ciancio on kidney cancer. Together they have revolutionized the surgical approach for large renal tumors, particularly those in which the tumor extends into the vena cava. Dr. Ciancio is a urologist, who is fellowship trained in renal and liver transplantation. More than 10 years ago, Drs. Soloway and Ciancio worked as a team to reduce the perioperative morbidity and mortality associated with these large tumor masses. Their idea was to incorporate surgical techniques from liver transplantation to increase the exposure of the vena cava with the anticipation that this would reduce blood loss and obviate circulatory arrest. Together they have published over 35 articles beginning with their first description of this technique in 2000. Their most recent publication is an update of their step-by-step approach toward minimizing complications related to renal cell carcinoma with vena cava thrombus. This series emphasizes the improvements in safety and reduction in operative mortality and morbidity related to their technique. Since most tertiary medical centers where these procedures are likely to be performed now have liver transplant surgeons, this technique can easily be duplicated.|$|E
