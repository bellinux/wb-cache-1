5|$|The shell {{consists}} of three layers: the outer layer (the periostracum) made of organic matter, a middle layer made of columnar <b>calcite,</b> and an inner layer consisting of laminated <b>calcite,</b> often nacreous.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell is}} {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either <b>calcite,</b> {{as is the case}} in oysters, or both <b>calcite</b> and aragonite. Sometimes, the aragonite forms an inner, nacreous layer, {{as is the case in}} the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of <b>calcite</b> and aragonite are laid down. The ligament and byssus, if calcified, are composed of aragonite. The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum, a skin-like layer which {{is composed of}} a conchiolin. The periostracum is secreted in the groove between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded. The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.|$|E

Sand <b>calcites</b> constitute a novel proxy to estimate paleo-groundwater levels and the extension of permafrost conditions.

30|$|In {{the former}} case, using the oxygen isotope {{fractionation}} factors (O’Neil et al. 1969; Friedman and O'Neil 1977; Chacko et al. 2001), the formation temperatures of disseminated <b>calcites</b> in the lavas are calculated to be 77 – 130  °C (Table  1 and Fig.  5 a). The δ 18 O {{values of the}} <b>calcites</b> in the undeformed jaspilites provide a slightly higher formation temperature range (105 – 158  °C). The difference in the formation temperatures indicates that the disseminated <b>calcites</b> in the lavas were formed mainly {{as a result of}} interaction with relatively low-temperature downwelling seawater from the seafloor, whereas the precipitation of jaspilites took place with a larger contribution of high-temperature iron-rich hydrothermal fluids derived from {{the lower part of the}} hydrothermal circulation cell. Be that as it may, the temperatures obtained for both <b>calcites</b> in the undeformed lavas and the hydrothermal jaspilites fall within the range of homogenization temperatures of the fluid inclusions (64 – 160  °C) in the Ongeluk hydrothermal quartz precipitates (Gutzmer et al. 2001, 2003; Saito et al. 2016). The consistency of the formation temperatures suggests that the generation of disseminated <b>calcites</b> in the lavas and jaspilites coincided with the precipitation of the hydrothermal quartz during subseafloor hydrothermal circulation. On the other hand, the <b>calcites</b> in the deformed samples show only high formation temperatures (147 – 156  °C), which are consistent with a metamorphic temperature not exceeding prehnite-pumpellyite facies (Gutzmer et al. 2001).|$|R
50|$|A {{major factor}} in drill bit {{selection}} {{is the type of}} formation to be drilled. The effectiveness of a drill bit varies by formation type. There are three types of formations: soft, medium and hard. A soft formation includes unconsolidated sands, clays, soft limestones, red beds and shale. Medium formations include <b>calcites,</b> dolomites, limestones, and hard shale. Hard formations include hard shale, <b>calcites,</b> mudstones, cherty lime stones and hard and abrasive formations.|$|R

5|$|All modern scleractinian skeletons are {{composed}} of calcium carbonate {{in the form of}} crystals of aragonite, however, a prehistoric scleractinian (Coelosimilia) had a non-aragonite skeletal structure which was composed of <b>calcite.</b> The structure of both simple and compound scleractinians is light and porous, rather than solid {{as is the case in}} the prehistoric order Rugosa. Scleractinians are also distinguished from rugosans by their pattern of septal insertion.|$|E
30|$|The {{formation}} {{temperatures of}} <b>calcites</b> in the Ongeluk lavas and hydrothermal jaspilite should—if the <b>calcites</b> were formed {{due to the}} seafloor hydrothermal circulation—ideally {{be consistent with the}} temperatures of seafloor hydrothermal alteration independently estimated from fluid inclusions in the Ongeluk hydrothermal quartz (Gutzmer et al. 2003; Saito et al. 2016). To estimate the formation temperatures of <b>calcites</b> from their δ 18 O values, a δ 18 O value of seawater must be assumed. However, there have long been two different models on the evolution of the δ 18 O value of seawater through the Earth’s history; the one is a constant δ 18 O value (e.g., Muehlenbachs and Clayton 1976; Blake et al. 2010; Tartèse et al. 2017) and the other is a gradually increasing δ 18 O value (e.g., Kasting et al. 2006).|$|R

40|$|Biogenic <b>calcites</b> {{may contain}} {{considerable}} magnesium concentrations, {{significantly higher than}} those observed in inorganic <b>calcites.</b> Control of ion concentrations in the calcifying space by transport systems and properties of the organic matrix of mineralization are probably involved in the incorporation of high magnesium quantities in biogenic <b>calcites,</b> but their relative effects have never been quantified. In vitro precipitation experiments performed at different Mg/Ca ratios in the solution and {{in the presence of}} soluble organic matrix macromolecules (SOM) extracted from sea urchin tests and spines showed that, at a constant temperature, magnesium incorporation in the precipitated minerals was mainly dependent on the Mg/Ca ratio of the solution. However, a significant increase in magnesium incorporation was observed in the presence of SOM compared with control experiments. Furthermore, this effect was more pronounced with SOM extracted from the test, which was richer in magnesium than the spines. According to SEM observations, amorphous calcium carbonate was precipitated at high Mg/Ca solution. The observed predominant effect of Mg/Ca solution, probably mediated in vivo by ion transport to and from the calcifying space, was suggested to induce and stabilize a transient magnesium-rich amorphous phase essential to the formation of high magnesium <b>calcites.</b> Aspartic acid rich proteins, shown to be more abundant in the test than in the spine matrix, further stabilize this amorphous phase. The involvement of the organic matrix in this process can explain the observation that sympatric organisms or even different skeletal elements of the same individual present different skeletal magnesium concentrations...|$|R

Minerals formed by alteration processes include alunite, <b>calcite,</b> cristobalite, illite, jarosite, kaolinite, pyrophyllite, quartz, smectite, sulfur and tridymite.

5|$|Like other elements, {{a variety}} of {{processes}} alter the relative abundance of calcium isotopes. The best studied of these processes is the mass-dependent fractionation of calcium isotopes that accompanies the precipitation of calcium minerals such as <b>calcite,</b> aragonite and apatite from solution. Lighter isotopes are preferentially incorporated into these minerals, leaving the surrounding solution enriched in heavier isotopes at a magnitude of roughly 0.025% per atomic mass unit (amu) at room temperature. Mass-dependent differences in calcium isotope composition are conventionally expressed by the ratio of two isotopes (usually 44Ca/40Ca) in a sample compared to the same ratio in a standard reference material. 44Ca/40Ca varies by about 1% among common earth materials.|$|E
5|$|Oviraptorid eggs {{appear to}} have been 17cm (6in) long on average, and the most {{complete}} eggs found with MPC-D107/15 are thought to have been 5to 6cm (2to 2.3in) wide and 14 to 16cm (5to 6in) long when intact. The eggs are nearly identical to some that have previously been found in Mongolia, and have therefore been assigned to the oofamily (egg-taxon family) Elongatoolithidae. The eggshells are relatively thin, between 1and 1.2mm (0.03and 0.04in), and their outer surface is covered by ridges and nodes that rise about 0.3mm (0.01in) above the shell.

40|$|Late Permian coals {{and coal}} {{measures}} in the Bowen Basin, Australia, are extensively mineralised with carbonates as cleat fillings and veins. The <b>calcites</b> in coal samples exhibit large variations in rare-earth element (REE) patterns and Sm-Nd ratios with some superchondritic values. Samples enriched in heavy REE (HREE) relative to light REE (LREE) define an Sm-Nd isochron corresponding to an age of 235 +/- 15 Ma, {{which is consistent with}} the timing of final contractional phase of the Hunter-Bowen orogeny. The corresponding initial epsilon Nd is + 1. 2 combined with HREE-enriched patterns suggests significant fluid interaction with primitive source rocks, which are consistent with arc-related volcanogenic sediments in the basin. <b>Calcites</b> characterised by HREE depletion relative to LREE are not in Sm-Nd isotopic equilibrium with the former samples that is interpreted to be due to the effect of a later hydrothermal event during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic. Vein <b>calcites</b> in mudrocks from the coal measures display more pronounced HREE depletion and significant positive EuCN anomalies, which is related to the later hydrothermal event. REE distributions, together with the basin burial history, suggest that physico-chemical environments of fluid-flow events during the two separate major tectonic regimes were significantly different. This study shows that a combined application of Sm-Nd dating and REE geochemical tracing of authigenic carbonate minerals is very useful to constrain the evolution of multiple fluid-flow events in a sedimentary basin with a complex history.
