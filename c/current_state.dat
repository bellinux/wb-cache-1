A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters.|$|E

5|$|St. Toros Church (Սուրբ Թորոս եկեղեցի, Surb T'oros yekeğetsi). According {{to local}} tradition, {{the church was}} built between 1270 and 1289 by Hethum I, the Armenian King of Cilicia in memory of his son, Toros, {{who was killed in}} a battle. The church was renovated to its <b>current</b> <b>state</b> in 1727.|$|E

These {{announced}} that the Sultan regretted that his <b>current</b> <b>state</b> of health prevented him from continuing with the successful campaign. His body was returned to Constantinople while the inner circle of officials pretended to keep up communication with him. Turkish sources state that the illusion was maintained for three weeks and that even the Sultan's personal physician was strangled as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|Although Brunner died on February 14, 1925, {{elements}} of his plans were still completed, {{except for his}} People's Court, which became a parking lot. Brunner planned a bridge to cross the railroad tracks and connect the capitol with the highest point in the city at 13thStreet. Brunner had also originally planned to have another bridge span the Susquehanna River, {{on the west side}} of the capitol. After his death, parts of the bridge were redesigned and became the <b>current</b> <b>State</b> Street Bridge, which was completed in 1930. The Education Building, or Forum Building, was completed in 1931.|$|E

Mayor Ferdinand Latrobe issued a proclamation, reciting the riot act and ordering the crowds to disperse, but to no effect. He later sent correspondence to the governor, asking that the garrison not be taken from the city given the <b>current</b> <b>state</b> of affairs. Police commissioners ordered the closing of all barrooms and saloons.|$|E

5|$|Dirge of Cerberus {{was first}} {{announced}} in September 2004, and {{was scheduled for}} release in Japan in 2005. The game's official site went online in April 2005. In May, Nomura stated that several snippets from the game would be revealed during that year's E3. However, no demo was shown at E3, as the staff were still trying to fix some issues with the controls in the game. In September, the beta test program was postponed indefinitely. Listed as 60% complete, the company stated if the beta test started with the game's <b>current</b> <b>state,</b> {{they would not be}} able to fully utilize the beta testers.|$|E
5|$|France's {{blockade}} {{had lasted}} for two years, and the 'American' government, inspired by 'American' spirit, was facing off with France, European principles, European pretensions. The social {{results of the}} French blockade, however, had been fruitful for the Argentine Republic, and served to demonstrate in all their nakedness the <b>current</b> <b>state</b> of mind and the new elements of struggle, which were to ignite a fierce war that can end only {{with the fall of}} that monstrous government.|$|E
5|$|Given its size, rock/ice {{composition}} {{and the possible}} presence of salt or ammonia in solution to lower the freezing point of water, Ariel's interior may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (372km) is about 64% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 56% of the moon's mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Ariel is about 0.3GPa (3kbar). The <b>current</b> <b>state</b> of the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E

In [16], the impulses were not considered in the systems. In [19], the impulses were considered in the systems, but they only depended on the <b>current</b> <b>states</b> of the systems.

5|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, the Zytglogge {{and the other}} Bernese gate towers were {{extended}} and decorated after the Burgundian Romantic fashion. The Zytglogge received a new lantern (including the metal bellman visible today), four decorative corner towerlets, heraldic decorations and probably its stair tower. The astronomical clock was extended to its <b>current</b> <b>state.</b> In 1527–30, the clockwork was completely rebuilt by Kaspar Brunner, and the gateway was overarched to provide a secure foundation for the heavy machinery.|$|E
5|$|Markov {{processes}} are stochastic processes, traditionally in discrete or continuous time, {{that have the}} Markov property, which means the next value of the Markov process depends on the current value, but it is conditionally independent of the previous values of the stochastic process. In other words, {{the behavior of the}} process in the future is stochastically independent of its behavior in the past, given the <b>current</b> <b>state</b> of the process.|$|E
