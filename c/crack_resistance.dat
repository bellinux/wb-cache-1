For these applications, titanium is alloyed with aluminium, zirconium, nickel, vanadium, and other elements to manufacture a variety of components including critical structural parts, fire walls, landing gear, exhaust ducts (helicopters), and hydraulic systems. In fact, about two thirds of all titanium metal produced is used in aircraft engines and frames. The SR-71 [...] "Blackbird" [...] {{was one of the}} first aircraft frames where titanium was used, paving the way for much wider use in modern military and commercial aircraft. An estimated 59 metric tons (130,000 pounds) are used in the Boeing 777, 45 in the Boeing 747, 18 in the Boeing 737, 32 in the Airbus A340, 18 in the Airbus A330, and 12 in the Airbus A320. The Airbus A380 may use 77 metric tons, including about 11 tons in the engines. In engine applications, titanium is used for rotors, compressor blades, hydraulic system components, and nacelles. The titanium 6AL-4V alloy accounts for almost 50% of all alloys used in aircraft applications.|$|E

40|$|Concrete {{structures}} {{are designed to}} be sustained for a specific service life time. When some of these structures age, they undergo deterioration due to their exposure to harsh environmental conditions and thus their structural and aesthetic functionalities get compromised. In order to restore such functionalities, concrete structures can be rehabilitated or repaired using concrete mortars as overlays (Vaysburd et al., 2012). On application, the concrete mortars usually experience substantial differential shrinkage that causes the build-up of internal tensile stress. Shrinkage cracking often happens if the concrete mortar does not exhibit sufficient tensile strength to sustain these stresses. The ingress of aggressive agents that may cause further deterioration on structure becomes easier (Shazali et al., 2012). The <b>cracking</b> <b>resistance</b> of concrete mortars has thus become a major concern in repair and rehabilitation of concrete structures.

5000|$|The high {{fracture}} toughness or <b>crack</b> <b>resistance</b> mentioned above {{is a result}} of the following mechanism: under load the ceramic matrix cracks, like any ceramic material, at an elongation of about 0.05%. In CMCs the embedded fibres bridge these cracks (see picture). This mechanism works only when the matrix can slide along the fibres, which means that there must be a weak bond between the fibres and matrix. A strong bond would require a very high elongation capability of the fibre bridging the crack, and would result in a brittle fracture, as with conventional ceramics. The production of CMC material with high <b>crack</b> <b>resistance</b> requires a step to weaken this bond between the fibres and matrix. This is achieved by depositing a thin layer of pyrolytic carbon or boron nitride on the fibres, which weakens the bond at the fibre/matrix interface (sometimes [...] "interface"), leading to the fibre pull-out at crack surfaces, as shown in the SEM picture at the top of this article. In oxide-CMCs, the high porosity of the matrix is sufficient to establish the weak bond.|$|E

In this paper, an analytical method is developed for determining the <b>crack</b> extension <b>resistance</b> curve of concrete.

According to this assumption, the <b>crack</b> extension <b>resistance</b> curve of concrete is expressed analytically as either the stress intensity factor caused by external forces, or the sum of the initial cracking toughness and the stress intensity factor by the cohesive stress within the fracture process zone. One advantage of this method is that, unlike other methods, the experimentally measured load-crack mouth opening displacement curve is not required in calculating the <b>crack</b> extension <b>resistance</b> curve. Based on numerical results, it is found that the <b>crack</b> extension <b>resistance</b> curve is independent of initial crack length.
