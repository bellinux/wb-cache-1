50|$|The rationalist position, stated simply, is that equal fault deserves equal blame. For example, {{given two}} drivers, {{both of whom}} failed to <b>check</b> their <b>brakes</b> before driving, one of them runs over a {{pedestrian}} as a consequence while the other does not. The rationalist would say that since both of the drivers were equally at fault in failing to <b>check</b> their <b>brakes,</b> it should make no difference {{that one of them}} was lucky in not hitting a pedestrian while the other was unlucky - moral fault is independent of consequence. Since the fault here is equal, the agents should receive equal blame.|$|R

5000|$|In December 2010, certain 2005-2007 model Acura RLs {{were subject}} to a safety recall for {{potential}} leaking of the brake master cylinder seal. [...] A seal in the brake master cylinder may be susceptible to damage following the use of brake fluid other than the recommended Acura or (Honda) Genuine DOT3 brake fluid. If the seal is damaged, it {{can result in a}} brake fluid leak under certain conditions. If a leak should occur, the driver might see a low brake fluid indicator light or a BRAKE FLUID LOW or <b>CHECK</b> <b>BRAKE</b> SYSTEM message. If the driver continues to drive the vehicle after receiving this message without refilling the brake fluid reservoir, it could result in a brake pedal that feels soft or spongy, and may eventually affect braking performance, increasing the risk of a crash. Affected vehicles were to be inspected and repaired, as applicable, at no charge. Reportedly, this recall applied to both 2005-2007 Acura RL and 2005-2007 Honda Odyssey models.|$|R

50|$|Like many early systems a {{mechanical}} train stop does not inherently control speed. There were accidents where trains had overrun the overlap due to excessive speed. In order to externally control {{the speed of}} a train the operation of timed train stops has been deployed as it is widely used on the New York City Subway, where a second trip arm at a distance is folded down only a few seconds after a train has passed a check point. These expensive speed control systems are generally phased out in favour of a cab control computer that can continuously <b>check</b> a <b>braking</b> curve while approaching a signal.|$|R

50|$|After {{repair and}} several <b>checks</b> of the <b>brake,</b> the turbine was {{restarted}} {{in order to}} bring it back into normal operation. At this time the wind was very strong.

After its generator was synchronized to the grid a noise from the nacelle prompted an attempt to stop the turbine manually. A large crashing sound occurred, possibly as a result of the gear failing, at which point the turbine began to oscillate strongly. The rotor then suddenly stopped but immediately started turning again. The rotor did not at first turn very fast, but it was now impossible to control the speed of rotation.|$|R
50|$|The {{two seats}} {{are in a}} tandem {{arrangement}} with dual controls, adjustable rudder pedals and seatbacks. The fuselage consists of a tubular sandwich and thus offers passive safety with low weight. The two-piece, mid-set, cantilever wing is a single-spar glass-fiber construction without flaps, but with upper side Schempp-Hirth-type air brakes. The wingtips curve downward, providing tip skids that allow take-offs without a wing helper (small wheel added with ASK-21 mi). The T-tail possesses a fixed horizontal stabilizer and an elevator with spring trim and automatic connections. The undercarriage consists {{of two or three}} fixed wheels. The main wheel lies behind the centre of gravity and has a hydraulically operated disc <b>brake.</b> <b>Checking</b> the tire pressure is hindered by the need for removing the wheel fairing.

50|$|At the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Räikkönen {{managed to}} out-qualify Vettel as they {{lined up on}} the second row of the grid behind the two Mercedes. A race which saw many crashes and incidents, was also a centre of {{controversy}} for Vettel who, under the safety car, steered his car into Hamilton's in frustration as he claimed that Hamilton had <b>brake</b> <b>checked</b> him just before the restart which caused damage to his front wing. He was awarded a 10 second stop-go penalty for that move. He finished in fourth, ahead of Hamilton who had to make a mandatory pit stop to change his loose headrest. Three penalty points were added to Vettel's licence and he later admitted his mistake and apologised to Hamilton and the FIA which saw him avoid a possible race ban. Räikkönen collided with Bottas on the opening lap. He retired on lap 46 as a precaution to prevent the failure of his suspension which had received damage from the crash with Bottas.|$|R
50|$|Highway 5A {{is often}} {{considered}} to be a back country highway due to its low traffic volumes and features unusual to highways (e.g. cattleguards). Highway 5A between Aspen Grove and Merritt saw major upgrades in the late 1980s to prepare for the opening of the Okanagan Connector, but still remained two lanes for several years after. When the Okanagan Connector opened on October 1, 1990, the Hamilton Hill section was moved to a new four lane alignment north of the former route. Controversial plans once called for the Okanagan Connector to continue past Aspen Grove and Highway 5A to meet with Highway 5 south of Merritt. When it became apparent that this extension was unlikely, the highway was four lanes in stages from Aspen Grove to the Hamilton Hill <b>Brake</b> <b>Check.</b> Although upgraded for Okanagan Connector traffic, Highway 5A from Aspen Grove to Merritt is not {{considered to be}} a freeway, due to its numerous at-grade intersections and undivided nature.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedNaval aviation accounts for 54 % of all naval fuel usage. With {{such a large}} footprint, even small reductions in fuel consumption can {{have a significant impact}} on the bottom line. Recognizing this fact, the Chief of Naval Operations has targeted naval aviation to achieve a 4 % reduction in non-mission fuel burn without adversely affecting mission execution or safety. In this thesis, we model ground operations at Naval Air Station (NAS) Oceana and NAS Lemoore to identify and reduce the time an aircraft spends with engines online during post-flight operations. Specifically, by reducing the processes performed while conducting hot <b>brake</b> <b>checks</b> and reducing resources required at the hot skids, we are able to save over $ 8 million at NAS Oceana and Lemoore alone. In addition, we have identified zero-cost coordination efforts that increase synchronization of fuel truck delivery to their consumers, such as noting refueling intentions on schedules to allow fuel truck managers to allocate trucks more efficiently, leading to additional savings. We provide recommendations specific to each base and recommendations that can be adopted fleet-wide. Finally, we identify that the current allocation of aircraft among bases is suboptimal and provide policy recommendations that would improve overall readiness.
