By relying on access points owned by users for access, wireless <b>community</b> <b>networks</b> provide a wireless infrastructure in an inexpensive way. However, the coverage of such a network is limited by the set of users who open their access points to the social community. Currently, it is not clear to what degree this paradigm can serve as a replacement, or a complimentary service, of existing centralized networks operating in licensed bands.

40|$|<b>Community</b> <b>networks</b> are {{decentralized}} communication networks, {{built and}} operated by citizens for citizens. Most of these networks originated for enabling Internet access for under-provisioned areas. With the consolidation of cloud technology, there is now also the potential to extend the <b>community</b> <b>networks</b> towards the application level, and deploy within these networks cloud-based applications. In this paper we conduct an experimental deployment {{of a set of}} applications on cloud-based infrastructures within <b>community</b> <b>networks.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} understand better the feasibility of running cloud-based applications in the challenging environment of these networks. For our study, we use several nodes inside of two <b>community</b> <b>networks</b> to host our applications and carry out experiments under realistic conditions. The results we obtain with deployments of ownCloud, Tahoe-LAFS and BitTorrent, are a correct functioning of the applications and a promising user experience. Our results could encourage users to contribute and participate in larger scale trials of clouds in <b>community</b> <b>networks,</b> and application developers to envision innovative services based on collective infrastructures.
