40|$|A {{high-speed}} optimal trailer steering controller for a tractor–semitrailer is discussed. A {{linear model}} of a tractor–semitrailer with steered trailer axles is described, and an optimal trailer steering controller is introduced. A path-following controller is derived to minimise the path-tracking error in steady-state manoeuvres using active trailer steering. A roll stability controller is introduced by adding the lateral acceleration of <b>trailer</b> <b>centre</b> of gravity as another objective in the steering controller, so as to improve roll stability in transient manoeuvres. A strategy to switch between these two control modes is demonstrated. Simulation {{results show that the}} steering controller can ensure good path tracking of articulated vehicles in steady-state manoeuvres and improve roll stability significantly in transient manoeuvres, while maintaining the path-tracking deviation within an acceptable range. Tests with an experimental tractor–semitrailer equipped with a high-bandwidth active steering system validate the controller design and simulation results. The roll stability controller reduces the measured rearward amplification by 27 %...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an optimal}} linear quadratic control algorithm {{to improve the}} roll stability of a tractor semi-trailer using active semi-trailer steering. The controller minimises {{a combination of the}} path-tracking deviation of the trailer rear end relative to the path of the hitch point (5 th wheel) and the lateral acceleration of <b>trailer</b> <b>centre</b> of gravity (CoG). First a linear vehicle model of tractor semi-trailer is constructed. Then a ‘virtual driver’ model for trailer steering control is introduced to minimise the path-tracking deviation of trailer rear end. The lateral acceleration of trailer CoG is included as a second objective of the optimal controller so as to improve roll stability. A Kalman filter with linear vehicle model is used to estimate unknown vehicle states, needed by the controller. Simulation results show that optimal control of semi-trailer steering could improve the roll stability significantly during transient manoeuvres while keeping the path-tracking deviation of trailer rear end within an acceptable range...|$|R

5000|$|In August 1951 UTA's York Road works outshopped two {{new power}} cars which, {{following}} {{on the first}} diesel acquisitions, were numbered 6 and 7. They lasted well, 15 July 1966 seeing their last recorded working, after which they were not used again, although not officially withdrawn. On the formation of NIR they {{were included in the}} stock transferred over, to be officially withdrawn in December 1968. To increase capacity the unit ran with coach 279, as a <b>centre</b> <b>trailer</b> car, which was converted to work with this set. It became 528 in 1958 ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{first batch}} of units, {{numbered}} 1101-1118, {{was built in}} 1957 as two-car units and classified as 2H.

However, owing to increasing passenger numbers, all eighteen units were strengthened to three cars in 1958 and 1969, {{with the addition of}} a <b>centre</b> <b>trailer,</b> and therefore were reclassified as 3H units. Upon the introduction of TOPS they were reclassified as Class 205. Some of these were later converted back to 2 car sets, but they retained their Class 205 designation.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1960s the Altrincham Electrics were {{approaching}} {{forty years of}} age. Rather than replace them with new rolling stock operating on the non-standard 1500 V DC system, {{the decision was made}} to withdraw the trains and convert the whole Altrincham line to 25 kV AC. The last 1500 V DC train was the 23.35 from Oxford Road on Friday 30 April 1971. Altrincham depot closed and all the 1931 rolling stock (provisionally assigned to Class 505 by British Rail) was withdrawn from service.On Monday 3 May 1971, a 15-min interval service was introduced from Altrincham, running through Manchester Piccadilly to Alderley Edge and Crewe. The unique 40-year-old, three-car Altrincham Electrics were replaced by 12-year-old, four-car Class 304 25 kV AC EMUs, based at Longsight depot. Three of the 1931 stock <b>centre</b> <b>trailer</b> cars were preserved and two are now undergoing restoration at the Midland Railway - Butterley in Derbyshire. However none of the motor coaches was preserved.|$|E
