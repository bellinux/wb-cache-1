These include Bellevue Beach, the Bellavista housing estate and the Bellevue Theatre, all completed between 1932 - 36 {{as some of the}} earliest Danish examples of Modernism. The area also includes a Jacobsen-designed restaurant, now called Jacobsen, which reopened in 2009 after thorough restoration and to good reviews.|$|E

The investment areas form part of the Katowice Special Economic Zone. The main initiator of activities pertaining to the economic development and investments is the Agency of Regional Development. In 2007, in areas surrounding the ISD Częstochowa Steelworks, the Częstochowa Industry Park was established.

40|$|There are {{increasing}} concerns regarding {{the quality of}} urban public spaces. Wind is one important environmental factor that influences pedestrians ’ comfort and safety. In modern cities there {{are increasing}} numbers of high constructions and complex forms which can involve problems of significant wind discomfort around these buildings. Architects and town planners need guidelines and simple design tools {{to take account of}} wind in their projects. In recent years the numerical investigation has emerged as powerful and sufficient tool for building optimization and a better township planning. Present work proposes the methodology to carry out exterior numerical on a cluster of existing structures and concludes with significant outcomes which are mostly neglected by the planners. Present work uses a three dimensional scale down model of buildings where steady incompressible flow analysis has been done. It has been implemented through ANSYS Fluent 12. 0 using SIMPLE algorithm as solver. The effect of turbulence has been captured using k- � model. Simulated work validates well with the available experimental result. The work progresses with single building simulation to a <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> with common external amenities. Some of the significant conclusion are changing ventilation pattern of air among buildings with wind direction, flow separation, wind shadow effect, location of amenities such as garden, playground etc...|$|E
