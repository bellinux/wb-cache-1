50|$|A <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> is {{an item of}} {{tangible}} personal property that can be physically possessed by the owner and can be transferred by delivery. Possession of a <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> is prima facie evidence of ownership.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> {{is opposed}} to chose in action, and denotes not only the right to enjoy or possess a thing, but also the actual or {{constructive}} enjoyment of it. The possession may be absolute or qualified. It is absolute when the person is fully and completely the proprietor or owner of the thing; it is qualified when he [...] "has not an exclusive right, or not a permanent right, but a right that may sometimes subsist {{and at other times}} not subsist", {{as in the case of}} animals ferae naturae ("of a feral nature", or wild). A <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> is freely transferable by delivery. Previous to the Married Women's Property Act of 1882, a wife's choses in possession became vested in her husband immediately upon her marriage, while her choses in action did not belong to her husband until he had converted them to possession. However, this difference is now practically obsolete.|$|E
5000|$|Chose (pronounced: , French for [...] "thing") is a {{term used}} in common law {{tradition}} in different senses. A chose local is a thing annexed to a place, such as a mill. A chose transitory is something movable, that can be carried from place to place. However, chose in those senses is practically obsolete, {{and it is now}} used only in the phrases chose in action and <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>possession.</b>|$|E

50|$|Punishments for minors <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> {{vary greatly}} from state-to-state. Since alcohol {{enforcement}} (and {{the establishment of}} drinking ages) {{is the responsibility of}} the individual states, only local and state agencies can legally write a minors <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> citation. As such, each state levies its own fines and punishments for a minors <b>in</b> <b>possession.</b>|$|R
50|$|In English law {{and some}} Commonwealth legal systems, items of {{tangible}} property {{are referred to}} as choses in possession (or a <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> in the singular). However, some property, despite being physical in nature, is classified in many legal systems as intangible property rather than tangible property because the rights associated with the physical item are of far greater significance than the physical properties. Principally, these are documentary intangibles. For example, a promissory note is a piece of paper that can be touched, but the real significance is not the physical paper, but the legal rights which the paper confers, and hence the promissory note is defined by the legal debt rather than the physical attributes.|$|E
