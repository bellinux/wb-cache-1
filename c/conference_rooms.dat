5|$|Dugan {{licensed}} {{this more}} practical system to Altec who produced 4- and 8-channel automixers for commercial installations such as hotels, <b>conference</b> <b>rooms,</b> courtrooms and city council chambers. The Dugan Speech System {{was the first}} commercially successful automixing algorithm. Over the next 15 years, other manufacturers designed competing automixers, and the market segment was born.|$|E
5|$|The White House today {{serves as}} a hotel and {{has a number of}} <b>conference</b> <b>rooms</b> on the ground floor, {{following}} extensive renovations in the 1990s.

Aft of the <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> is a projection <b>room</b> serving the <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> and the briefing room. The projection room had the capability of projecting computer graphics, overhead transparencies, or 35 mm slides to either the <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> or the briefing room either singularly or simultaneously.

40|$|Echo {{and sound}} {{resonance}} in a <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> cause obscure speech and make listeners tired. Thus, the acoustical properties of a <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> are vitally important. The <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> 412 at Sharif University Physics Department {{failed to meet}} basic acoustical standards. The aim {{of this research is}} to improve reverberation time (RT) of the <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> using Helmholtz resonators with defined dimensions, diffusers, and sound absorbers. Helmholtz resonators are widely used to absorb sound noise especially at low frequencies. They are particularly useful when noise has a narrow-frequency band. One of the advantages of using Helmholtz resonators is their capacity to be tuned on different frequencies. We enhanced acoustical properties of Helmholtz resonators using proper absorbers and diffusers. In order to decrease the RT, a large number of Helmholtz resonators have been made and installed in proper positions in the <b>conference</b> <b>room.</b> The RT was measured before and after installation. The measurements indicate that the acoustical characteristics of the <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> have been significantly improved...|$|R
5|$|Smoking {{legislation}} in North Korea has tightened in recent years, {{although it is}} still relatively lax and has not had any really meaningful effect on curtailing smoking rates. The rules on where people can or cannot smoke are complex, with smoking prohibited on sidewalks, ferries, airplanes and at stations, in health-care and educational facilities, kindergartens and nurseries, shops, theaters, cinemas, culture halls and <b>conference</b> <b>rooms,</b> historic and battle sites, and hotel lobbies. However, smoking is not prohibited in either private or work vehicles or on-board trains, at bus stops, near entrances to buildings, in universities, government offices, workplaces, restaurants, cafes, bars, or nightclubs.|$|E
5|$|The $2 million project, which {{includes}} a complete overhaul and revisioning of the current library space, added new spaces for resource stacks, new areas for studying and reading, including a casual reading room in the great hall under the tower, new classroom and seminar spaces and <b>conference</b> <b>rooms,</b> a new location for library archives, a listening and viewing room, and office space. Additionally, the new City College library features new computers and access to online databases. Construction of the new library commenced in January 2016.|$|E

5|$|Thirty-five {{years after}} its opening, Baden-Powell House was {{refurbished}} in a six-month Â£2million programme, providing all modern amenities such as private facilities for all rooms, double glazing, and air conditioning, as well as enhancing conference facilities for large and small events. Upon completion of the programme, the house was opened {{by the president of}} The Scout Association, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 5 June 1997. In 2002 a Starbucks coffee (discontinued before 2015) and sandwich bar was opened, as well as an outdoor roof garden adjacent to the meeting <b>conference</b> <b>rooms</b> on the second floor.|$|E
5|$|First {{offered in}} 1946 in the Sandusky area and later {{expanded}} to serve Erie, Huron, Lorain, and Ottawa counties, extension programs established {{a foundation for}} BGSU Firelands, the university's regional campus. The college was established at a site located near Lake Erie in Huron, Ohio when the first building (now Foundation Hall) was opened. In 2003, Cedar Point Center opened its doors on the Firelands campus. The facility houses a 450-seat divisible public meeting area, smaller <b>conference</b> <b>rooms,</b> a cyber cafe, multimedia classrooms, and two distance learning classrooms. In March 2011, BGSU Firelands unveiled a new master plan calling {{for the construction of}} three buildings to handle more students, more college/community partnerships; and expand the James H.

5|$|Although the {{facility}} did attract visitors, local residents' support {{failed to reach}} the numbers expected by the founders. Original projections of 300,000 admissions per year were never met. In October 2006, the museum announced plans to turn galleries into <b>conference</b> <b>rooms,</b> remove most of the museum's focus on art, and lay off 28 of its 85 employees (most of whom were security guards for the art gallery). At the time, Copia had $68 million ($ today) in debt. That year the museum also lowered its original adult admission fee of $12.50 to $5. For three months in 2006, the museum admitted guests free of charge, and attendance and revenue increased. The museum also began hosting weddings and renting its space more frequently {{in order to raise}} revenue. In 2007, the museum altered its theme significantly by removing its focus on food and art, and instead focusing solely on wine. It replaced some of its gardens with vineyards, changed its displays to focus more on the history and aspects of wine and viticulture, and decreased the restaurant's and programs' focus on food.|$|E
