40|$|Stichopus vastus {{is one of}} sea {{cucumber}} resources utilize which has commercial economic value, locally known as “gametes”. Because this species is continuously exploited, while the nature of life has not been known, one of them especially its growth. Aspect of growth is an important parameter which {{is used as a}} basis for evaluating these resources, hence this resource is well managed and can be utilized in a sustainable manner. The study aims to: (1) estimates the growth characteristics mortality rate, recruitment and potential use of {{sea cucumber}} of S. vastus in Karimunjawa. The study is expected to give beneficial to the species of sea cucumber resource management strategy at Karimunjawa waters, Jepara. The analysis of the growth parameters of S. vastus obtained values of growth coeficient (K) of 0. 55 year- 1 and length infinity L ∞ value of 315. 80 mm. Therefore the obtained values of K tend to be close to zero value, it indicates the nature of growth tends to slow and with a relatively long life. Life span of S. vastus is 5. 41 years, which can achieve body lengths of 283. 06 to 296. 91 mm, and the monthly growth rate ranged from 9. 0 to 12. 37 mm. The results of the analysis of mortality showed that S. vastus has value of total mortality (Z) of 0. 98, natural mortality (M) of 0. 298, and catch mortality (F) of 0. 682, with the rate of exploitation (E) of 0. 6963. This suggests that the rate of exploitation is above the threshold standard set by the Government of 0. 5 (BRKP, 2004). The analysis of the S. vastus the recruitment showed that the higest percentage recruit occurred in May-June is 17. 16 - 18. 33 %. This is presumably due to a population increase of the spawning process in those months, although the value of the addition is not very significant. It is suggested the need for regulations regarding: (a) the catchmentseason which is based on the tendency of the reproductive patterns of S. vastus, in Karimujawa, (b) restrictions {{on the size of the}} catch, (c) catch quotas, (d) the methods that are environmentally friendly <b>catch,</b> (<b>e)</b> permits the ship / boat used to catch sea cucumbers business.

The approach can be broadened to allow for uncertainties in the placement of the boundaries assumed to link high latitude catches to breeding stocks. Because of the interaction between populations arising from the procedure to allocate high latitude catches amongst breeding stocks, the conventional SIR-based Bayesian approach proved impractical to expand. Instead uniform priors on the various preexploitation level (K) parameters were assumed with the intent to later iteratively adjust these to account for their being informative about the values of the intrinsic growth rate (r) parameters. Initial results (which will need later refinement) are presented purely for the purposes of illustrating the application of the approach...|$|R
