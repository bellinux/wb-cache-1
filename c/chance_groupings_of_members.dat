50|$|The term {{division}} {{is also used}} in US college sports to indicate the <b>groupings</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> a given conference. However, this usage is more recent. The first conference to divide its teams into divisions was the Southeastern Conference which, upon expanding to 12 members in 1992, divided into Eastern and Western divisions. Other conferences have undergone similar expansion and division. The usage in the section above is still maintained. For example, the Georgia Bulldogs are in Division I, but {{are also in the}} Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference.|$|R
25|$|A number <b>of</b> {{separate}} supranational <b>groupings</b> <b>of</b> countries exist, {{and membership}} in some <b>of</b> these <b>groupings</b> may involve multinational agreements and treaties in which member countries agree {{to some degree}} of reciprocity regarding voting rights.

50|$|Warrego was, as {{with the}} rest of the state, held by independents and loose <b>groupings</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> around the {{government}} of the day until the first years of the twentieth century, when the partisan system took hold. It then became a stronghold of the centre-left Australian Labor Party, who held it without interruption from 1908 to 1974. The decline of the rural working class changed the demographics of the electorate drastically, however, and it fell to the conservative National Party of Australia at the height of the popularity of the Bjelke-Petersen government in 1974. The National Party strongly increased their hold on the seat thereafter, and it is today one of their safest seats. The current member, Ann Leahy, has held the seat since 2015.|$|R
5000|$|The UMP's {{original}} statutes in 2002 {{allowed for}} the organisation of formal factions or movements within the party, to represent the various political families of which it was made up. However, fearing leadership rivalries and divisions, Juppé, Chirac and later Sarkozy 'postponed' the creation of such organised movements indefinitely. Nevertheless, prior to the organisations of formal [...] "movements" [...] in November 2012, there existed informal <b>groupings</b> <b>of</b> like-minded <b>members,</b> either through associations, political clubs, associated political parties or even informal factions.|$|R
5000|$|Elite parties form as <b>groupings</b> <b>of</b> elite <b>members</b> {{particularly}} {{in situations where}} an individual politician's political standing can be secured {{without the support of}} large populations. An elite party can form internally in the parliament and its political power is derived from that <b>of</b> its individual <b>members.</b> Elite parties have practically no extra-parliamentary structure and are generally more flexible than mass parties. The central role of independent, powerful individuals implies that their structure is often loose and that their policy may be internally disputed due to disagreements between individual members. As Duverger states, in elite parties [...] "the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> Parliament play a key role".|$|R

30|$|French {{speakers}} such as Sarkozy or Gomès, who {{are both}} producing elite discourse {{in the context of}} the independence debate, are seen to actively employ the ‘non-dit’ to interact with the audience, thereby relying on shared knowledge as a means of creating a feeling of intersubjectivity or fellowship that connects all French discourse members, while at the same time excluding anyone who does not share the same concerns, such as, for example, some Kanak <b>groupings</b> or <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the local Asian or Polynesian communities.|$|R
50|$|In urban sociology, {{fragmentation}} {{refers to}} the absence or the underdevelopment of connections between the society and the <b>groupings</b> <b>of</b> some <b>members</b> <b>of</b> that society on {{the lines of a}} common culture, nationality, race, language, occupation, religion, income level, or other common interests. This gap between the concerned group and the rest might be social, indicating poor interrelationships among each other; economical based on structural inequalities; institutional in terms of formal and specific political, occupational, educative or associative organizations and/or geographic implying regional or residential concentration. bell hooks coined the term when addressing the problem of 'hierarchy of oppression' within the feminist movement; where some felt experiencing more types of oppression gave greater validity to one's opinion and, therefore undermined group strength and solidarity within the movement as much as non-interscectional identity did in the 1970s female identity was seen predominantly through the lens of white, middle-class women and didn't take into consideration that identity could be made up of many more cultural influences such as race, gender, sexuality, spirituality etc. all intersecting across points of privilege and oppression. hooks argued for greater inclusivity, mutual support and an understanding of various types of feminism within the movement; each sharing the same equity goals, yet having different ideas on the methods to achieve such goals.|$|R

Li has favored an incremental, steady approach, such as fostering checks and balances by giving some real power to the 'democratic parties' as well as other <b>groupings</b> <b>of</b> non-CPC professionals and businessmen. It is at Li's insistence as CPPCC chief that the status <b>of</b> non-CPC <b>members</b> as well as <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the eight [...] "democratic parties" [...] (civic society <b>groupings</b> <b>of</b> academics, professionals and businessmen) has been raised.

Based on observation, interviews, {{participation}} and secondary documents the paper uses Coser's theory of Social Conflict to suggest a four part model of how tourism engenders different forms of social conflict and fluctuating alliances between stakeholders {{in an environment where}} tourism has been introduced by agents external to the indigenous community. The actors are ethnic <b>groupings</b> and <b>members</b> <b>of</b> those groups, governmental officials at local, regional and national level, intermediaries of the tourism industry and private sector entrepreneurs drawn from the majority and minority ethnic groups. Tensions are identified as being based on beliefs, resources and power, and a sequential pattern of primacy is identified consistent with stages of the tourist area life cycle...|$|R
