40|$|Aims and Objectives: To {{validate}} the Parsonnet scoring model to predict mortality following adult cardiac surgery in Indian scenario. Materials and Methods: A total of 889 consecutive patients undergoing adult cardiac surgery between January 2010 and April 2011 {{were included in}} the study. The Parsonnet score was determined for each patient and its predictive ability for in-hospital mortality was evaluated. The validation of Parsonnet score was performed for the total data and separately for the sub-groups coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valve surgery and <b>combined</b> <b>procedures</b> (CABG with valve surgery). The model calibration was performed using Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis for discrimination. Independent predictors of mortality were assessed from the variables used in the Parsonnet score by multivariate regression analysis. Results: The overall mortality was 6. 3 % (56 patients), 7. 1 % (34 patients) for CABG, 4. 3 % (16 patients) for valve surgery and 16. 2 % (6 patients) for <b>combined</b> <b>procedures.</b> The Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic was < 0. 05 for the total data and also within the sub-groups suggesting that the predicted outcome using Parsonnet score did not match the observed outcome. The area under the ROC curve for the total data was 0. 699 (95 % confidence interval 0. 62 - 0. 77) and when tested separately, it was 0. 73 (0. 64 - 0. 81) for CABG, 0. 79 (0. 63 - 0. 92) for valve surgery (good discriminatory ability) and only 0. 55 (0. 26 - 0. 83) for <b>combined</b> <b>procedures.</b> The independent predictors of mortality determined for the total data were low ejection fraction (odds ratio [OR] - 1. 7), preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump (OR - 10. 7), <b>combined</b> <b>procedures</b> (OR - 5. 1), dialysis dependency (OR - 23. 4), and re-operation (OR - 9. 4).

Methods: In this study, we reviewed 45 eyes of 36 patients who underwent the <b>combined</b> <b>procedure</b> (lateral tar-sal strip, retractor tightening, and everting sutures) for the management of involutional lower eyelid entropion and compared the results with 31 eyes of 25 patients who underwent the Wies procedure. Exclusion criteria included previous lower eyelid surgery and follow-up of less than 6 months. Results: No patients demonstrated entropion on the first postoperative day. The mean follow-up period was 18. 4 months (6 to 52 months) in the Wies group and 22. 6 months (6 to 59 months) in the <b>combined</b> <b>procedure</b> group. During the follow-up period, 9 of 31 eyes in the Wies group presented with recurrence and only 1 of 45 eyes in the <b>combined</b> <b>procedure</b> group presented with recurrence (p = 0. 001).

40|$|Study Design: A {{retrospective}} {{review was}} carried out on 23 patients with rigid fixed kyphosis who underwent surgical correction for their deformity. Purpose: To report the results of surgical correction of fixed kyphosis according to the surgical approaches or methods. Overview of Literature: Surgical correction of fixed kyphosis is more dangerous than the correction of any other spinal deformity {{because of the high}} incidence of paraplegia. Methods: There were 12 cases of acute angular kyphosis (6 congenital, 6 healed tuberculosis) and 11 cases of round kyphosis (10 ankylosing spondylitis, 1 Scheuermann’s kyphosis). Patients were excluded if their kyphosis was due to active tuberculosis, fractures, or degenerative lumbar changes. Operative procedures consisted of anterior, posterior and combined approaches with or without total vertebrectomy. Anterior procedure only was performed in 2 cases, while posterior procedure only was performed in 8 cases. <b>Combined</b> <b>procedures</b> were used in 13 cases, including 4 total vertebrectomies. Results: The average kyphotic angle was 71. 8 �preoperatively, 31. 0 �postoperatively, and the average final angle was 39. 2 �. Thus, the correction rate was 57 % and the correction loss rate was 12 %. In acute angular kyphosis, correction rate of an anterior procedure only was 71 %, correction rate of the <b>combined</b> <b>procedures</b> without total vertebrectomy was 49 % and correction rate of the <b>combined</b> <b>procedures</b> with total vertebrectomy was 60 %. In round kyphosis, correction rate of posterior procedure only was 65 % and correction rate of <b>combined</b> <b>procedures</b> was 59 %. The clinical results according to the Kirkaldy-Willis scale demonstrated 17 excellent outcomes, 5 good outcomes and one poor outcome. Conclusions: Our data indicates that the combined approach and especially the total vertebrectomy showed the safety and the greatest correction rate if acute angular kyphosis was greater than 60 degrees.

40|$|Background: First {{described}} by Gonzales-Ullo in 1960, combined augmentation/mastopexy {{has increased in}} popularity amongst patients interested in a single stage procedure that reduces cost and decreases recovery time. The controversy surrounding the combined technique {{stems from the fact}} that augmentation and mastopexy represent conflicting procedures: augmentation expands and stretches breast tissue while mastopexy reduces the size of the skin envelope. Although the <b>combined</b> <b>procedure</b> has been described, there are few large studies comparing a single surgeon's outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 320 consecutive patients from 2000 - 2009 who underwent combined augmentation/mastopexy (113), augmentation (194), and mastopexy (13). Data was collected and compared among the three groups in terms of pre-operative risk factors and ptosis grade, operative technique, implant size, and post-operative complications. Results: The most common complications for the <b>combined</b> <b>procedure</b> were areolar widening (17. 7 %), hypertrophic scarring (8. 8 %), decreased nipple sensation (7. 1 %), implant malposition (6. 2 %), and hematoma formation (6. 2 %). The tissue related complications were similarly higher in the combined and mastopexy groups, but the implant related complications such as implant malposition, capsular contracture, and double bubble occurred less frequently in the combined group than with augmentation alone. Conclusion: Although it has often been suggested that a <b>combined</b> <b>procedure</b> carries a risk higher than performing augmentation and mastopexy individually, our results indicate that a <b>combined</b> <b>procedure</b> can produce excellent results with decreased implant related complications.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with resectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma often present obstructive {{jaundice}} {{and a small}} future remnant liver (FRL) ratio. A sequential approach comprising preoperative biliary drainage followed by portal vein embolization (PVE) is usually performed but leads to long preoperative management (6 - 12  weeks) before patients can undergo resection. To simplify and shorten this phase of liver preparation, we developed a new preoperative approach that involves percutaneous biliary drainage and PVE during the same procedure. We report the outcomes of this <b>combined</b> <b>procedure.</b> METHODS: During 1  year, four patients underwent simultaneous biliary drainage and PVE followed 1  month later by surgical resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Liver volumes were assessed by CT before, and 1, and 3  months after the <b>combined</b> <b>procedure.</b> Serum liver enzymes were assessed before and 1  month after the <b>combined</b> <b>procedure.</b> RESULTS: The <b>combined</b> <b>procedure</b> was feasible in all cases, with no related complications. After the <b>combined</b> <b>procedure,</b> transaminases remained stable or decreased, whereas gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin decreased. During the first month, the left lobe volume increased by + 27. 9  % (range 19 - 40. 9  %). The FRL ratio increased from 24. 9 to 33. 2  %. All patients underwent R 0 liver resection with a favorable postoperative outcome. The remnant liver volume increased by + 132  % (range 78 - 245  %) between 1 and 3  months. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous percutaneous biliary drainage and PVE is feasible. This all-in-one preoperative approach greatly decreases waiting time until surgical resection.

The effect of previous LVRS on lung transplant outcomes has been inadequately studied. We report our experience in the largest single institution series of these <b>combined</b> <b>procedures.</b> MethodsThe records of 472 patients with COPD undergoing lung transplantation or LVRS between 1995 and 2010 were reviewed. Outcomes of patients undergoing transplant after LVRS were compared with outcomes of patients undergoing transplant or LVRS alone. Survival was compared using log-rank tests and the Kaplan-Meier method. ResultsDemographics, comorbidities, and spirometry were similar at the time of transplantation. Patients who had undergone lung transplant after LVRS had longer transplant operative times (mean 4. 4 vs 5. 6 hours; P = . 020) and greater hospital length of stay (mean 17. 6 vs 29. 1 days; P = . 005). Thirty-day mortality and major morbidity were similar. Posttransplant survival was reduced for transplant after LVRS (median, 49 months; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 16, 85 months) compared with transplant alone (median, 96 months; 95 % CI, 82, 106 months; P = . 008). The composite benefit of <b>combined</b> <b>procedures,</b> defined as bridge from LVRS to transplant of 55 months and posttransplant survival of 49 months (total 104 months), was comparable with survival of patients undergoing either procedure alone.

This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the risk of performing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) at the time of diagnostic catheterization (“combined procedures”). Background. Health care providers are under increasing pressure to combine diagnostic and interventional coronary procedures to reduce costs. However, the risk associated with <b>combined</b> <b>procedures</b> has not been rigorously assessed. Methods. A multicenter cohort study of 35, 700 patients undergoing elective PTCA from 1992 through 1995 was performed to determine the risk of major complications (myocardial infarction, emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery or death) from combined relative to staged procedures (i. e., performing PTCA at a session subsequent to diagnostic catheterization). Results. The risks of major complications from <b>combined</b> and staged <b>procedures</b> were 2. 0 % and 1. 6 %, respectively (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 1. 28, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 05 to 1. 57). After adjusting for clinical and angiographic differences and clustering by laboratory, the risk from <b>combined</b> <b>procedures</b> was not significantly elevated (multivariable OR 1. 18, 95 % CI 0. 89 to 1. 55). However, several subgroups of patients did have an increased risk from combined procedures: patients with multivessel disease (multivariable OR 1. 64, 95 % CI 1. 13 to 2. 39); women (multivariable OR 1. 64, 95 % CI 1. 05 to 2. 55); patients > 65 years old (multivariable OR 1. 40, 95 % CI 1. 02 to 1. 93); and patients undergoing multilesion PTCA (multivariable OR 1. 53, 95 % CI 1. 06 to 2. 21). The risk of combined relative to staged procedures decreased over the 4 -year period (multivariable p = 0. 029). Conclusions. Combining PTCA with diagnostic catheterization appears to be safe in many patients. However, several subgroups of patients may be at increased risk.
