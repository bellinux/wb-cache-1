40|$|The cement {{production}} is an {{energy intensive industry}} with energy typically accounting for 50 - 60 % of the production costs. In order to recover waste heat from the preheater exhaust and <b>clinker</b> <b>cooler</b> exhaust gases in cement plant, single flash steam cycle, dual-pressure steam cycle, organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and the Kalina cycle are used for cogeneration in cement plant.

40|$|Clinker burning {{process has}} a decisive {{influence}} on energy consumption {{and the cost}} of cement production. A new problem is to use the process of decarbonization of alternative fuels from waste. These issues are particularly important in the introduction of a two-stage combustion of fuel in a rotary kiln without the typical reactor-decarbonizator. This work presents results of numerical studies on thermal-hydraulic phenomena in the riser chamber, which will be designed to burn fuel in the system where combustion air is supplied separately from the <b>clinker</b> <b>cooler.</b> The mathematical model is based on a combination of two methods of motion description: Euler description for the gas phase and Lagrange description for particles. Heat transfer between particles of raw material and gas was added to the numerical calculations. The main aim of the research was finding the correct fractional distribution of particles. For assumed particle distribution on the first stage of work, authors noted that all particles were carried away by the upper outlet to the preheater tower, what is not corresponding to the results of experimental studies. The obtained results of calculations can be the basis for further optimization of the design and operating conditions in the riser chamber with the implementation of the system...|$|E
40|$|The {{cement clinker}} {{manufacturing}} {{process is a}} complex process which involves energy conversion and consumption.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated reaction engineering based mathematical model for clinker formation in cement industry. Separate models for pre-heater, calciner, rotary kiln and cooler were initially developed and coupled together {{to build an}} integrated simulator. Appropriate models for simulating gas-solid contact and heat transfer in pre-heaters were developed. Calciner was modeled by considering simultaneous combustion of coal particles and calcination of raw meal. Complex heat transfer and reactions (solid-solid, gas-solid and homogeneous reactions in gas phase) in rotary kiln were modeled using three sub-models coupled to each other. Solid-solid reactions in the bed region of the kiln were modeled using pseudo-homogeneous approximation. Melting of solids {{in the bed and}} formation of coating within the kiln were accounted. <b>Clinker</b> <b>cooler</b> was simulated by developing a two-dimensional model to capture cross-flow heat transfer between air and hot clinkers. The individual models were coupled with each other via mass and energy communication through common boundaries. The coupled model equations were solved iteratively. The model predictions agree well with the observations and experience from cement industry. The model was used to gain better understanding of influence of operating conditions on energy consumption in cement plant. Several ways for reducing energy consumption were computationally investigated. The integrated model, the developed software RoCKS (for Rotary Cement Kiln Simulator) and results presented here will be useful for enhancing our understanding and for enhancing the performance of clinker manufacturing.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this master thesis {{have been to}} model and simulate oxy-combustion CO 2 capture in a cement plant. The model developed is a process simulation of the calcination process with varying degree of air in-leakage, where heat is supplied by combustion in an oxygen rich environment, followed by capture of the CO 2. The further gas separation after H 2 O condensation to achieve the required CO 2 quality was evaluated. In addition to the process simulations, a review of literature related to oxy-combustion CO 2 capture and cement production was performed, and an engineering evaluation of the necessary modifications to the cement plant conducted. A simulation model was built in Aspen HYSYS, and student Jelmer de Winter s project work was utilized as a starting point. The model was developed with the aim to achieve results comparable to a process model constructed by the European Cement Research Academy (ECRA) in 2009. The goal was to capture {{as much of the}} CO 2 as possible, and to achieve a CO 2 purity of minimum 95 mol-% after the CO 2 Compression and Purification Unit (CPU). CO 2 purity in the dry flue gas of ~ 85 mol % was achieved, with a CO 2 capture rate up to 96. 4 %. Five different air in-leakages (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 % of total flue gas flow) were tested. The results showed that the CO 2 concentration in the flue gas decreased with increasing degree of air in-leakage. The decrease in CO 2 concentration causes an increase of the power consumption of the CO 2 CPU of ~ 2. 6 % per percentage point of air in-leakage, and the CO 2 capture rate was also reduced when the air in-leakage increased. These results agree well with results from previous oxy-combustion studies, and show the importance of minimizing air in-leakages in the cement plant. If oxy-combustion capture is to be utilized at a cement plant, some process modifications and additional equipment is required. An Air Separation Unit (ASU) is needed to provide almost pure oxygen for the combustion process. A Compression and Purification Unit (CPU) is also required, in order achieve the necessary CO 2 purity and transport conditions. When using oxy-combustion technology, both the material conversion in the cement kiln system and the operational specifications of the overall process are different from those in conventional kiln operation. However, research made by ECRA in 2012 showed that the negative impacts of oxy-combustion on the product quality seem to be negligible. Other necessary process modifications when retrofitting with oxy-combustion are news design of the kiln burner and the <b>clinker</b> <b>cooler</b> in the cement plant. In addition, prevention of excessive air in-leakage by improving sealing locations at the cement plant is necessary, as the simulation results show. This is possible e. g. by waste gas flushed systems, or by an improved maintenance of inspection doors and similar devices. The CPU is up to a certain point capable of handling changes in the flue gas composition at short-term inspections; however it limits its efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{function}} of a cement <b>clinker</b> <b>cooler</b> must always be the adequate cooling of the clinker product; however {{from the point of}} view of fuel economy, such coolers are also designed to utilise the sensible heat of the clinker to preheat the secondary air necessary for combustion. In modern, large capacity plant, the efficiency of heat recuperation has assumed a growing importance because of two related economic factors. The first is cutting fuel costs via the well understood benefits of heat recuperation; the second factor is the gradual improvement in fuel economy of cement kilns in general. As kilns become more finely tuned, the air required for combustion is reduced in direct proportion to the fuel usage, i. e. less air is available to cool a unit quantity of clinker. Hence, in order to avoid the situation where more air is supplied to the cooler than is required for complete combustion of the fuel, more efficient heat recuperation is needed. The Fuels and Energy Research Group at the University of Surrey (FERGUS), first became aware of these kiln/cooler problems in the late 1960 's, during the course of their pioneer work on the aerodynamics of rotary cement kilns. Consequently during the last decade, FERGUS has actively investigated the limitations of grate cooler systems, in general. In the initial stages of the research, a perspex water model was constructed at the University, based on some of the largest kilns in the world, those at. Northfleet Works of Blue Circle Industries. These coolers were experiencing "air sliding" of the clinker bed, causing red hot clinker to be dumped onto the rubber belt conveyors. Using suitable flow tracing media under controlled, scaled flow conditions, the aerodynamics of the Fuller grate cooler were studied, thus revealing that the air flow balance through the chambers at the hotter end of the cooler was more significant in its effect on the clinker bed than the balance at the colder end. A solution to this problem could then be achieved by using a three step grate. Water modelling, although giving quick visual solutions to aerodynamics problems, is only qualitative. In order to quantify results, various models of rotary kiln cooler systems have been constructed, in particular a 1 / 24 th scale model of the No. 2 kiln of Rugby Cement's South Ferriby Works. This kiln had for some time suffered from excessive wear rates in the burning zone refractory lining, an expensive problem in terms of down-time and rebricking. Air model pitot static measurements indicated that the air jet (representing the fuel/primary air stream) was exhibiting a peculiar "corkscrewing" effect, which could possibly be the cause of impingement on the refractory lining, leading to premature failure of the refractory coating. Correct kiln firing practice is to promote recirculation of combustion products; these gases, being cooler than the flame, protect the brickwork from overheating. It was already understood that the primary cause of flame impingement was a lack of recirculation due to insufficient burner momentum flux, the solution being a costly change in the firing system. However, the air model results were later verified by full scale plant trials and a solution was proposed to eliminate the "corkscrewing" effect by means of a wedge- shaped bluff body welded along the jet axis. This study has quantified the macro aerodynamic effects of grate cooler systems, through the media of air and water modelling. Considerable information has also been obtained on the dynamic behaviour and heat transfer mechanisms of a particular polysize bed of clinker particles. From this information, putative predictions can be made regarding the general behaviour of clinker in beds. Recommendations have been made for further studies in this area.

Three types of clinkers were prepared with 0 wt. % (BC), 5 wt. % (BC 5) and 10 wt. % (BC 10) EAFS, respectively. The design of the raw mixes was based on the compositional indices lime saturation factor (LSF), alumina ratio (AR) and silica ratio (SR).

[...] Department of Geosciences. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2015 The {{rate at which}} cement <b>clinker</b> is <b>cooled</b> as it exits the kiln {{has long been known}} to be an important factor in cement quality. Cooling rate is one of the variables that has {{a significant impact on the}} minerals produced during the cement making process. The goal of the industry has been to produce cement clinker containing minerals that are highly reactive with water. Highly reactive clinker minerals will equate to improved mortar strength and faster set times than clinker with minerals that have a lower level of reactivity. This study analyzed five cooling rates of Portland cement clinker produced in a laboratory. Characteristics of clinker minerals were then analyzed with an emphasis on silicate minerals, alite and belite. The fastest cooled sample was determined to be the best quality sample in terms of hydraulic reactivity. Alites and belites in this sample exhibited good crystal form. The belite minerals from this sample had higher levels of foreign ions which yielded more highly reactive belite polymorphs. This sample had less periclase than other samples and small, more amorphous aluminate and ferrite crystals. With progressively slower cooling rates, less hydraulically reactive silicate minerals with increasingly poor crystal form were observed. Periclase content increased in slower cooled samples and aluminate and ferrite crystals were progressively larger.

5000|$|The {{rotary kiln}} {{consists}} of a tube made from steel plate, and lined with firebrick. The tube slopes slightly (1-4°) and slowly rotates on its axis at between 30 and 250 revolutions per hour. Rawmix is fed in at the upper end, and {{the rotation of the}} kiln causes it gradually to move downhill {{to the other end of}} the kiln. At the other end fuel, in the form of gas, oil, or pulverized solid fuel, is blown in through the [...] "burner pipe", producing a large concentric flame in the lower part of the kiln tube. As material moves under the flame, it reaches its peak temperature, before dropping out of the kiln tube into the cooler. Air is drawn first through the cooler and then through the kiln for combustion of the fuel. In the cooler the air is heated by the <b>cooling</b> <b>clinker,</b> so that it may be 400 to 800 °C before it enters the kiln, thus causing intense and rapid combustion of the fuel.|$|R
5000|$|The cement {{is made by}} fusing {{together}} a mixture of a calcium-bearing material (normally calcium oxide from limestone) and an aluminium-bearing material (normally bauxite for general purposes, or refined alumina for white and refractory cements). The liquified mixture cools to a vesicular, basalt-like clinker which is ground alone to produce the finished product. Because complete melting usually takes place, raw materials in lump-form can be used. A typical kiln arrangement comprises a reverberatory furnace provided with a shaft preheater in which the hot exhaust gases pass upward as the lump raw material mix passes downward. The preheater recuperates most of the heat in the combustion gases, dehydrates and de-hydroxylates the bauxite and de-carbonates the limestone. The calcined material drops into the [...] "cool end" [...] of the melt bath. The melt overflows the hot end of the furnace into molds in which it cools and solidifies. The system is fired with pulverized coal or oil. The <b>cooled</b> <b>clinker</b> ingots are crushed and ground in a ball-mill. In the case of high-alumina refractory cements, where the mix only sinters, a rotary kiln can be used.|$|R

The twin pipes in the center of the picture transport 900 °C hot air from the plant’s cooling zone to the calciner to utilize the process heat for combustion. The tower on the right of the picture houses the 5 -stage heat exchanger in two-string design. The central calciner duct can be seen attached to the outside, which branches at the top and leads downward into the two heat exchanger strings. Also in the tower, but concealed by the calciner, are two large CC-type combustion chambers. These combustion chambers have been optimized in recent years for the use of AFR (Alternative Fuels and Raw Materials). The alternative fuels are charged and combusted to a large degree. Full residue-free combustion then takes place in the calciner. The raw material passes through this process in a counterflow, i. e. it is fed into the top of the heat exchanger tower and preheated to around 800 °C on the way down.

40|$|Today {{virtually}} all cement clinker burning processes {{take place in}} rotary kilns. A mixture of calcareous and argilaceous materials is heated to a temperature of about 1450 °C. In this process decarbonation followed by partial fusion occurs, and nodules of so-called clinker are formed. The <b>cooled</b> <b>clinker</b> is mixed with a few percent of gypsum, and ground into a fine meal - cement. The most modern cement kilns are equipped with a precalciner, in {{which most of the}} calcium carbonate decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide, before the precalcined meal enters the rotary kiln, where the rest of the burning takes place. The endothermic cement burning process requires large amounts of thermal energy, which is supplied by fuel combustion in the rotary kiln and in the precalciner. Coal and petcoke are most frequently used, but oil and natural gas, are also burnt in some plants. However, due the negative impact of the fossil fuels on the environment, alternative fuels are utilized to an ever increasing extent. Norcem, Norway's sole cement manufacturer, has experience with alternative fuel combustion since 1987, when combustion of liquid hazardous waste (LHW) was started.

40|$|Clinker {{production}} {{is a high}} impact process in the cement industry due to the elevated emission of gases and the energy consumption, inherent to the calcination of limestone used as raw material. Clinker manufacture {{takes place in a}} kiln system whose configuration varies depending on the technological update. Within the wide spectrum of existing technologies, rotary kiln system will have generally three major heat energy losses: (1) outflow gases after heating the raw material; (2) the air cooler excess required for <b>cooling</b> <b>clinker</b> leaving the furnace tube to handling temperature; and, (3) the radiation through the entire surface of the system. A typical energy balance for a modern kiln, indicates that about 23 % of the heat is lost with waste gases, 11 % with the cooler excess gas and 10 % by radiation throughout the entire system’s surface. In this work, a technical and economic prefeasibility evaluation is developed for a thermal recovery system of wasted heat in a suspension-preheater kiln for clinker production. The alternatives explored are a heat recovery preheating raw material system and power electricity generation using an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). The results of the study show the feed-preheating system is the most attractive alternative in comparison with the option to generate electricity.
