40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we will discuss}} how the value placed on {{increasing}} 2 ̆ 018 choice 2 ̆ 019 {{is a major factor}} determining both childcare and elder care policies, focussing in particular on the increasing emphasis on using cash allowances and tax credits or reliefs to achieve greater diversity of provision and better 2 ̆ 018 value for money 2 ̆ 019. The use of <b>cash</b> <b>means</b> understanding how families and service providers in the market respond to incentives to provide more care and what choices are important both to those who need care and those who give it. However, as Nancy Folbre has pointed out: 'In order to solve the care problems, we need to understand how markets work, but also how they don 2 ̆ 019 t work' (cited in Waerness, 2006 p 76 [ [...] . ]). We therefore begin by examining first, why the cost of care is increasing and second what happens when care is treated in the market {{as if it were a}} commodity like any other. Third, what evidence is there about how the capacity of and willingness to care within families is changing. Does it suggest growth or decline? Does state support for care, especially in the form of cash, substitute for or complement family care? Third, we will examine the circumstances in which 2 ̆ 018 cash for care 2 ̆ 019 policies offer meaningful choices both to those giving care and those who need it. By comparing childcare and elder care policies and practices and analysing their differences, it is easier to evaluate the consequences of treating care provision as a means to achieving other policy objectives rather than as a worthy end in itself...|$|E
3000|$|Wealthy {{families}} {{have an advantage}} {{when it comes to}} access to grazing patches, both distant and local. For example, based on rainfall differences alone, no herder should move to Sukuton for grazing. However, given its close proximity to Mpala (which provides security patrols near the borders and nearby dams), many herders choose to move there, presumably because it is safer and closer to home than more distant patches that may have better quality grazing. Furthermore, herders whose herds are too large to be absorbed by Mpala, which can only accommodate a limited number of animals onto its land during any given season (100 - 150 animals per season from all group ranches), must be moved elsewhere. Typically the grazing patches bordering a rented patch (such as Sukuton/Endana) or patches bordering land on your own patch (Koija in the case of Tiamamut GR) have similar although not ideal conditions to the patches with higher overall rainfall (green up of grass, ease of access, less crowding). Making the [...] "best of a bad situation" [...] means that both poor/middle class families and rich families must make decisions that are not ideal in order to provide some sort of water or grazing support for their animals during hard times. Access to <b>cash</b> <b>means</b> that wealthy families can move their animals farther distances if they choose to do so. As we have seen in this paper, some wealthy families chose to use patches closer to home (Koija for wealthy Tiamamut herders, for example) because they have family relations or social affines in those patches that provide free support. Wealthy families that choose to move to distant patches have to hire herding labour or split their household, both choices that may not be convenient or expedient. Ultimately, wealthy herders, because of their social connectedness and access to cash can choose to move to any patch of land they want, giving them much greater flexibility than their poorer neighbors at home.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} benefits of tourism to local communities and conservation in Batang Ai, Sarawak, Malaysia. The main focus of this study is on the environmental sustainability of Batang Ai National Park, which is dependent on the sustainable extraction of natural resources by local communities with privileges to hunt, fish and gather forest produce from the park. There are seven longhouses in and adjacent to Batang Ai National Park with a total of 592 people having privileges within the park. Research on the use of tropical forests shows that one person per square kilometre is sustainable if people are obtaining all their protein requirements from the forest. Batang Ai National Park, with a total area of 240 square kilometres, is clearly not sustainable if all the protein requirements of the people with privileges are derived from the park. Tourism is seen as a non-consumptive method of providing benefits to the local communities, which is hoped to reduce their dependence on the natural resources of the park. A combination of both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods was used for the study. These methods include questionnaire surveys, community group interviews and key informants interviews. Questionnaire surveys were conducted on people with gazetted rights and privileges within the park, including those who were residing in longhouses in resettlement schemes three to four hours travel from the park. Community 'group interviews' were conducted in eleven longhouses and sixteen in-depth interviews with key informants from government agencies, non-government organisations, private sector, and local organisations were also conducted. Results indicate that local communities believe that tourism can benefit them and they believe that it is important to protect the environment, forest and wildlife in order to attract tourists. However, lack of opportunity for earning <b>cash</b> <b>means</b> that their well-being depends on the continued use of natural resources from the forest. Results also indicate that local communities can benefit from tourism and that tourism can benefit conservation, however, the benefits are dependent on the volume and distribution of tourists. During the survey, only the Rh. Ngumbang community receives regular tourists and correspondingly has a higher income, while other communities rarely had tourists and received little or no benefits from tourism. Overall, tourism in Ulu Batang Ai has few or no effects on the local communities' traditional way of life, and their well being still depends on farming, hunting, fishing and gathering forest produce. For Batang Ai National Park to achieve its conservation goals, it is crucial that the forest areas next to the longhouses in Ulu Batang Ai be able to continue to provide the longhouse communities with their requirements of forest produce. Failing this their well-being will be compromised or they might obtain these requirements from the park thus, compromising the conservation values of the national park...|$|E
