5000|$|Thus, in a basic conveyance, [...] "O grants Blackacre to B for life, then to B's heirs," [...] absent {{the rule}} {{there was a}} life estate in B, and a <b>contingent</b> <b>remainder</b> in B's heirs. The Rule {{converted}} the <b>contingent</b> <b>remainder</b> in B's heirs into a vested remainder in B.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>contingent</b> <b>{{remainder}}</b> {{is created}} when a remainder cannot fully vest {{at the time}} of granting. This normally occurs in two situations: ...|$|E
5000|$|Analysis (B): B has a <b>contingent</b> <b>remainder</b> {{subject to}} {{condition}} precedent, because Blackacre will vest in B, {{but only if}} B is married to C at the moment A dies.|$|E

50|$|Legislatures {{and courts}} tend to prefer vested <b>remainders</b> over <b>contingent</b> <b>remainders,</b> to reduce {{uncertainty}} in ambiguous grants, and {{to speed up}} probate.|$|R
5000|$|Fearne's 1772 work, [...] "Essay on the Learning of <b>Contingent</b> <b>Remainders</b> and Executory Devices", {{is deemed}} {{to have done}} [...] "more than any other to {{preserve}} the Rule in Shelley's Case as black letter law (as distinguished from a rule of construction)." [...] His Essay on the Learning of <b>Contingent</b> <b>Remainders</b> and Executory Devises, the work which has made {{his reputation as a}} legal authority, and which passed through numerous editions, was called forth by a decision of Lord Mansfield in the case of Perrin v.

5000|$|A {{common law}} rule [...] "that a {{freehold}} <b>contingent</b> <b>remainder</b> {{which does not}} vest at or before the termination of the preceding freehold estate is destroyed.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{remainders}} in property law, vested and contingent. A vested remainder is held by a specific person without any conditions precedent; a <b>contingent</b> <b>remainder</b> is one for which the holder has not been identified, or for which a condition precedent must be satisfied.|$|E
50|$|John Trenchard, then Sir John, died in 1495, leaving land in Horringford, which Lady Joan Bowerman {{held for}} life, to his second son Henry in tail-male with <b>contingent</b> <b>remainder</b> to {{his eldest son}} Thomas. In the reign of Edward VI the custody of land in Horringford and the {{wardship}} of Henry Trenchard was granted to John Russell, Earl of Bedford, and in 1560 Henry Trenchard granted the manor to John Collyer. The manor was in 1613-14 {{in the possession of}} Nicholas Deane of Holdenhurst, co. Hants, who settled it at that time on his wife Frances and his heirs by her.|$|E

50|$|Smith {{was best}} known as the author of the Manual of Equity (1845), Compendium of the Law of Real and Personal Property (1855), and Manual of Common Law and Bankruptcy (1864). These {{standard}} works went through many editions. He was the draughtsman of the Consolidated General Orders of the High Court of Chancery (1860), and also edited Charles Fearne's <b>Contingent</b> <b>Remainders</b> and John Mitford's Chancery Pleadings. In addition he compiled manuals of devotion and a Summary of the Law of Christ (1859 and 1860).|$|R
5000|$|In {{property}} {{law of the}} United States and some Canadian provinces, pur autre vie (Old French for [...] "for another's life") is a duration of a property interest. [...] While it {{is similar to a}} life estate, it differs in that a person's life interest will last for the life of another person instead of their own. [...] For example, if Bob is given use of the family house for as long as his mother lives, he has possession of the house pur autre vie. Pur autre vie can occur when a <b>contingent</b> <b>remainder</b> is destroyed, in a Doctrine of Merger situation, where one person acquires the life estate of another and thereby destroys a remainder not already vested.|$|E
5000|$|The rule {{is often}} stated as follows: “No {{interest}} is good unless it must vest, if at all, {{not later than}} twenty-one years {{after the death of}} some life in being at the creation of the interest.” [...] For the purposes of the rule, a life is [...] "in being" [...] at conception. Although most discussions and analysis relating to the rule revolve around wills and trusts, the rule applies to any future dispositions of property, including options. When a part of a grant or will violates the rule, only that portion of the grant or devise is removed. All other parts that do not violate the rule are still valid. The perpetuities period under the common law rule is not a fixed term of years. By its terms, the rule limits the period to at the latest 21 years after the death of the last identifiable individual living at the time the interest was created ("life in being"). This [...] "measuring" [...] life (often incorrectly called the [...] "validating" [...] life) need not have been a purchaser or taker in the conveyance or devise. The measuring life could be the grantor, a life tenant, a tenant for a term of years, {{or in the case of}} a <b>contingent</b> <b>remainder</b> or executory devise to a class of unascertained individuals, the person capable of producing members of that class. Any one of the [...] "measuring" [...] lives that vindicates the conveyance by resolving all contingencies will be called a [...] "validating" [...] life. This is because this [...] "measuring" [...] life has made the conveyance.|$|E
40|$|The {{recent case}} of Bisby v. Walker, 169 N. W. 467, {{decided by the}} Supreme Court of Iowa November 23, 1918, is an {{interesting}} instance of an all too common lack of appreciation {{and understanding of the}} very fundamentals of property law. Under the will of her grandfather B became entitled to a <b>contingent</b> <b>remainder</b> (at least the court treated it as such) in certain lands; the contingency upon which her taking depended was her being one of the surviving children of her mother {{at the time of the}} death of the life tenant, the testator 2 ̆ 7 s widow. During the continuance of the prior estate and therefore while her remainder was contingent B executed several mortgages, some describing the mortgaged property by metes and bounds and some as all her 2 ̆ 2 right, title, and interest 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 in the devised lands. These mortgages all contained covenants for title or recitals indicating an intention to convey 2 ̆ 2 absolute title in fee simple. 2 ̆ 2 While the remainder was still contingent, and after the execution of all of the mortgages but one B went through bankruptcy and received the usual discharge. It was held, undoubtedly correctly so, that the mortgages were enforceable liens upon B 2 ̆ 7 s interest in the devised lands after the death of the life tenant, B having survived her...|$|E
5000|$|Stated more formally, {{the common}} law rule against perpetuities forbids some future {{interests}} (traditionally <b>contingent</b> <b>remainders</b> and executory interests) that may not vest within the time permitted; the rule [...] "limits {{the ability of a}} decedent to exercise dead hand control over property, which the state wishes to be alienable. [...] In essence, the rule prevents a person from putting qualifications and criteria in his/her will that will continue to control or affect the distribution of assets long after he or she has died, a concept often referred to as control by the [...] "dead hand" [...] or [...] "mortmain".|$|R
6000|$|The fact is, society {{considers}} that in certain instances {{it has a}} right to expect the thinker will martyrise himself on its account, while it stands serenely by and heaps faggots on the pile, with every mark of contempt and loathing. But society is mistaken. No man is bound to martyrise himself; in a great many cases a man is bound to do the exact opposite. He has given hostages to Fortune, and his first duty is to the hostages. [...] "We ask you for bread," [...] his children may well say, [...] "and you give us a noble moral lesson. We ask you for clothing, and you supply us with a beautiful poetical fancy." [...] This is not according to bargain. Wife and children have a first mortgage on a man's activities; society has only a right to <b>contingent</b> <b>remainders.</b>|$|R
50|$|A deed dated 12 August 1472 (12 Edward IV.)held at North Devon Record Office is as follows:Arbitration Award by deed poll, by Philip Beaumont, Esq., John Denys, John Orchard, and John Reigny.Deals with {{a dispute}} between James Fleming, Baron of Slane, {{on the one}} side and John Bellewe, Patrick his son, Amy wife of John Bellewe, Walter Delune and Amy his wife, on the other side, over the lands late {{belonging}} to Christopher Fleming, knight, in Devon. The award provides that (1) Patrick Bellewe shall have a moiety of rents worth £10.2s., from lands in South Molton parish, and a moiety of lands called Asshrogus (i.e. Ash Barton Estate), in Braunton, and of Puttesburgh in Georgeham. (2) Walter Delune and his wife Anne to have the other moiety of the rent from South Molton, and of Asshrogus and of Puttesburgh. The <b>contingent</b> <b>remainders</b> to the above lands are set out at length, giving information about the genealogy of the Fleming family. Not executed.|$|R
5000|$|The rule is {{notoriously}} difficult to properly apply, {{as pointed out}} by a 1961 decision of the Supreme Court of California which held {{that it was not}} legal malpractice for an attorney to draft a will that inadvertently violated the rule against perpetuities. Therefore, in the United States it has been abolished by statute in Alaska, Idaho, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and South Dakota. [...] The Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities validates non-vested interests that would otherwise be void as violating the common law rule if that interest actually vests within 90 years of its creation; it has been enacted in 29 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia), the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and is currently under consideration in New York. Other jurisdictions apply the [...] "wait and see" [...] or [...] "cy-près doctrine" [...] that validates <b>contingent</b> <b>remainders</b> and executory interests that would be void under the traditional rule in certain circumstances. [...] These doctrines have also been codified in the United Kingdom by the 1964 statute.|$|R
5000|$|Analysis: The {{class of}} B's {{children}} can't be determined until approximately thirty-eight weeks after A dies, so any {{children who are}} unborn {{at the time of}} the grant have a <b>remainder</b> <b>contingent</b> upon B having offspring. Children of B are fully vested as soon as they are born, provided A is still alive. B's children who are born have vested remainder subject to open, because the conveyance was given to a class of persons (B's Children) and B could still have more children. If A dies before B, then the class is closed, and only those children alive at A's death will have an interest.|$|R
50|$|In the Battle of Minden on 1 August 1759, British and Hanoverian {{infantry}} of {{the centre}} made an advance on the French cavalry and artillery in that sector. They apparently went in without orders and their attacking line formation even repulsed repeated French cavalry charges, holding {{until the last}} moment then firing a massive volley when the charge came within ten yards. As the disrupted French began {{to fall back on}} Minden, Ferdinand called for a British cavalry charge to complete the victory, but Sackville withheld permission for their advance. Ferdinand sent his order several times, but Sackville was estranged from Lord Granby, the force commander. He continued to withhold permission for Granby to gain glory through an attack. For this action, he was cashiered and sent home. Granby replaced him as commander of the British <b>contingent</b> for the <b>remainder</b> of the war.|$|R
500|$|Land mines {{were used}} by the SADF and SWAPO and became a major feature of the war, {{triggering}} the development of mine-protected vehicles (MPV). The SADF typically laid marked, fenced, anti-personnel minefields as perimeter protection for bases and vital assets. It laid a reported 45,000 mines during the conflict, of which 3,000 were unaccounted-for when UNTAG arrived. SWAPO used mines for ambushing or intimidation. Mines were laid individually or in clusters; anti-tank mines were often stacked. The mines were obtained from South Africa, the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. After initial training by the SADF's 25th Field Squadron, an early task of the Field Troop was to conduct mine-awareness training for the other <b>contingents.</b> For the <b>remainder</b> of the deployment, {{much of the work}} of the 75 field engineers was clearing exposed mines, marking minefields and clearing routes. Crocker wrote, [...] "for {{the first time since the}} Vietnam War, Australian Sappers hand cleared their way into live minefields on seven separate occasions to destroy exposed mines. Similar mines killed several civilians and many animals during the mission. Field engineers of the contingent destroyed over 5,000 items of unexploded ordnance (UXO) ranging from artillery shells, through RPG rockets to grenades. UXO, a legacy of the 20-year Bush War, posed a major hazard to local inhabitants in the northern provinces and to UNTAG personnel in that area".|$|R
