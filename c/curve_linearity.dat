The adoption of new and emerging sensor technologies like anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), giant magnetoresistance (GMR) and tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) sensors are mainly driven by their integrability and enhanced sensitivity. At the core of such sensors, a microstructured ferromagnetic thin film element transduces the magnetic signal. Such elements usually switch via multi-domain, C- or S-shaped magnetization states and, therefore, often exhibit an open non-linear hysteresis <b>curve.</b> <b>Linearity</b> and hysteretic effects, as well as magnetic noise are key features in the improvement of such sensors. Here, we report on the physical origin of these disturbing factors and the inherent connection of noise and hysteresis. Critical noise sources are identified by means of analytic and micromagnetic models. The dominant noise source is due to irreproducible magnetic switching of the transducer element at external fields close to the Stoner Wohlfarth switching field. Furthermore, a solution is presented to overcome these limiting factors: a disruptive sensor design is proposed and analyzed which realizes a topologically protected magnetic vortex state in the transducer element. Compared to state of the art sensors the proposed sensor layout has negligible hysteresis, a linear regime about an order of magnitude higher and lower magnetic noise making the sensor ideal candidate for applications ranging from automotive industry to biological application...|$|E

A number of samples based on xLi 2 CO 3 + (100  x) H 3 BO 3, where 10 ≤ x ≤ 25 mol%, have been prepared using melt - quenching technique. The crystalline phases of undoped and doped glasses were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The results of XRD patterns indicated that the glass samples were amorphous. The best TL-response of undoped lithium borate glass was identified with a composition of 85 % H 3 BO 3 + 15 % Li 2 CO 3 and this glass composition was doped with 0. 1 mol% gold nano-particle.

40|$|International audienceSelected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) {{carried out}} on triple-quadrupole mass spectrometers coupled to liquid {{chromatography}} has been a reference method to develop quantitative analysis of small molecules in biological or environmental matrices for years and is currently emerging as a promising tool in clinical proteomic. However, sensitive assays in complex matrices are often hampered {{by the presence of}} co-eluted compounds that share redundant transitions with the target species. On-the-fly better selection of the precursor ion by high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) or increased quadrupole resolution is one way to escape from interferences. In the present work we document the potential interest of substituting classical gas-collision activation mode by laser-induced dissociation in the visible wavelength range to improve the specificity of the fragmentation step. Optimization of the laser beam pathway across the different quadrupoles to ensure high photo-dissociation yield in Q 2 without detectable fragmentation in Q 1 was assessed with sucrose tagged with a push-pull chromophore.

40|$|Mass spectrometric imaging (MSI) is an {{analytical}} technique {{used to determine}} the distribution of individual analytes within a given sample. A wide array of analytes and samples can be investigated by MSI, including drug distribution in rats, lipid analysis from brain tissue, protein differentiation in tumors, and plant metabolite distributions. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is a soft ionization technique capable of desorbing and ionizing a large range of compounds, and it is the most common ionization source used in MSI. MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) is generally considered to be a qualitative analytical technique because of significant ion-signal variability. Consequently, MSI is also thought to be a qualitative technique because of the quantitative limitations of MALDI coupled with the homogeneity of tissue sections inherent in an MSI experiment. Thus, conclusions based on MS images are often limited by the inability to correlate ion signal increases with actual concentration increases. Here, we report a quantitative MSI method for the analysis of cocaine (COC) from brain tissue using a deuterated internal standard (COC-d 3) combined with wide-isolation MS/MS for analysis of the tissue extracts with scan-by-scan COC-to-COC-d 3 normalization.

Within-day variations in endogenous plasma concentrations of the M 30 and M 65 antigens were assessed in two predose blood samples collected from a cohort of 15 ovarian cancer patients receiving carboplatin chemotherapy and were shown to be no greater than the variability associated with methods themselves. Between-day fluctuations in circulating levels of the M 30 and M 65 antigens and in XIAP mRNA levels measured in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} by quantitative (q) RT–PCR were evaluated in two predose blood samples collected with a 5 - to 7 -day gap from 23 patients with advanced cancer enrolled in a phase I trial. The mean variation between the two pretreatment values ranged from 13 to 14 to 25 %, respectively, for M 65, M 30 and qRT–PCR. These data suggest that the M 30 and M 65 Elisa's and qRT–PCR as PD biomarker assays have favourable performance characteristics for further investigation in clinical trials of anticancer agents which induce tumour apoptosis/necrosis or knockdown of the anti-apoptotic protein XIAP...|$|E
40|$|This study {{concerns}} on the thermoluminescence {{properties of}} Al 2 O 3 :C, Mg exposed to cobalt- 60 gamma rays. The thermoluminescence properties investigated were thermoluminescence glow <b>curve,</b> <b>linearity,</b> sensitivity, fading, reproducibility, minimum detactable dose, energy response and thermoluminescence parameters. The samples were supplied by Testbourne Ltd, England {{in the form}} of sputtering target and the samples were crushed into powder form with grain size of 75 µm to 200 µm. The crystalline phase of the samples was identified using X-ray diffraction analysis. The results indicated that the powder samples are in polycrystalline state. Thermoluminescence properties were investigated by irradiating the samples to cobalt- 60 gamma ray with doses from 5 Gy to 70 Gy. The glow curves were analyzed to determine various thermoluminescence properties of the samples. The results clearly show that Al 2 O 3 :C (0. 2 %), Mg (0. 2 %) has better thermoluminescence properties in terms of sensitivity, linearity, reproducibility and fading compared to other samples. Zeff of the samples were calculated as 10. 83 ± 0. 01 and the results are close to Zeff of bone. The total mass absorption coefficients of Al 2 O 3 :C (0. 2 %) and Al 2 O 3 :C (0. 2 %), Mg (0. 2 %) were calculated using WinXCom software in order to calculate the photon energy response of the samples. By using the trumpet graph, the values of R (Dmeasured / Ddelivered) for Al 2 O 3 :C (0. 2 %), Mg (0. 2 %) sample were within the acceptable limit recommended by ICRP. The average activation energy of Al 2 O 3 :C (0. 2 %) and Al 2 O 3 :C (0. 2 %), Mg (0. 2 %) were calculated as 2. 03 eV and 1. 49 eV, respectively. The frequency factor calculated from TL glow curves of Al 2 O 3 :C (0. 2 %) and Al 2 O 3 :C (0. 2 %), Mg (0. 2 %) were 2. 61 ? 1025 s? 1 and 7. 51 ? 1017 s? 1, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Whenmanual assays of antithrombin-IIl {{with use}} of {{different}} synthetic chromogenic peptide substrates are modified for a centrifugal analyzer, the downwarddeflectionof the refer-ence curve at the zero point raises a serious problem, because {{the position of the}} zero value is included in the calculation of the reference <b>curve.</b> Complete <b>linearity</b> was obtained by addition of polyethylene glycol 6000 to the thrombin solution and Tween 80 to the substrate solution in final concentrations of 1 g/L and 100 mg/L, respectively. The additives increased the concentration of active thrombin in thesolutions by preventing its adsorptionand aggregation, and the solubility of the substrates in aqueous media is increased. The precisionof the optimized method, tested in routine assays during three months, yielded an estimated day-to-day CV of 3. 4 %. AddItIonal Keyphras. s: centrifugal analyzer. heritable disor...|$|R
