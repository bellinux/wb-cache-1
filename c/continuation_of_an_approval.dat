40|$|Continuations are {{variously}} {{understood as}} {{representations of the}} current evaluation context and as representations {{of the rest of}} the computation, but these understandings contradict each other: plugging an expression in a context yields a new expression whereas sending an intermediate result to a continuation yields the final answer. We show that continuations-as-evaluation-contexts are the defunctionalized representation <b>of</b> the <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> singlestep reduction function and that continuations-as-the-rest-of-thecomputation are the <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> evaluation function. Furthermore, we show that defunctionalizing the <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> evaluator gives rise to the same evaluation contexts as in the singlestep reducer. The only difference is how these evaluation contexts are interpreted: a `plug' interpretation yields one-step reduction, whereas a `refocus' interpretation yields evaluation...|$|R

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} {{difficulties}} an analyst encounters when modeling suspension and <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> process in contemporary process modeling languages.

The comparison shows that the contemporary process modeling languages cover the defined general lifecycle <b>of</b> <b>an</b> activity only partially. There are picked two popular process modeling languages and there is modeled real example, which reviews how the modeling languages can get along with their lack of native support <b>of</b> suspension and <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> activity. Upon the unsatisfying results of the contemporary process modeling languages in the modeled example, there is presented a new process modeling language which, as demonstrated, is capable of capturing suspension and <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> activity in much simpler and precise way...|$|R
