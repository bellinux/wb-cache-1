A two kilometers causeway construction was built which is situated on the soft clay layer. In order to investigate the behavior of causeway embankment, a full-scale test was conducted of high embankment built on a soft clay deposit. The embankment with 3, 5 m high was supported by two types of reinforcement such as raft and raftaggregate <b>column</b> <b>foundation.</b> Since the ground was undergoing consolidation due to the preload, the raft and raft-aggregate column foundations were monitored in order to analyze the vertical ground movement by inducing the settlement of the foundation.

Hence, the effectiveness of lightweight concrete “cakar ayam” foundation on that soil, have been able to determined according the settlement value was obtained. Implementation of research was doing using Plaxis 3 D foundation software. The foundation design was various according to the several of the column length. The slab thickness, spacing between <b>column,</b> <b>foundation</b> and column size was fixed. Soil parameters to analyse lightweight concrete “cakar ayam” foundation, was obtained from previous studies and Research Center of Soft Soil, Universiti Tun Hussien Onn Malaysia, (RECESS, UTHM).

The settlement value was over 25 mm, when the load 20 kN/m 2 was applied on the foundation, to all length of column on soft clay. However, the settlement value was lower than 25 mm, when the load 40 kN/m 2 was applied on the foundation, to all length of column on sand and clayey silt. From all the settlement value, it could be seen that clayey silt result was more effective than sand. The settlement value also was decrease when the length of pile was increase.

40|$|Soil {{improvement}} using vibro stone column techniques {{consists of}} two main parts: (1) the installed load bearing columns of well-compacted, coarse-grained material and (2) the improvements to the surrounding soil due to vibro compaction. Extensive research work {{has been carried out}} over the last 20 years to understand the improvement in the composite foundation performance due to the second part mentioned above. Nevertheless, few of these studies have tried to quantify some of the key design parameters, namely the changes in the stiffness and stress state of the treated soil, or have consider these parameters in the design and calculation process. Consequently, empirical and conservative design methods are still being used by ground improvement companies with a significant variety of results in engineering practice. Two-dimensional finite element study to develop an axisymmetric model of a single stone column reinforced foundation was performed using PLAXIS 2 D AE to quantify the effect of the vibro installation of this column in soft saturated clay. Settlement and bearing performance were studied as {{an essential part of the}} design and calculation of the stone <b>column</b> <b>foundation.</b> Particular attention was paid to the large deformation in the soft clay around the installed column caused by the lateral expansion. So updated mesh advanced option was taken in the analysis. In this analysis, different degrees of stone column lateral expansions were simulated and numerically analyzed, and then the changes in the stress state, stiffness, settlement performance and bearing capacity were quantified. It was found that application of radial expansion will produce a horizontal stress in the soft clay mass that gradually decrease as the distance from the stone column axis increases. The excess pore pressure due to the undrained conditions starts to dissipate immediately after finishing the column installation, allowing the horizontal stress to relax. Changes in the coefficient of the lateral earth pressure K ٭, which is very important in representing the stress state, and the new stiffness distribution in the reinforced clay mass, were estimated. More encouraging results showed that increasing the expansion during column installation has a noticeable effect on improving the bearing capacity and reducing the settlement of reinforced ground, So, a design method should include this significant effect of the applied lateral displacement during the stone column instillation in simulation and numerical analysis design...|$|E

To prevent instability of the <b>columns,</b> the <b>foundation</b> masonry is injected with a hydraulic grout. For the preservation of the archaeological remains, possibly available in the soil, the penetration of the grout into the layered soil must be prevented. Specific properties of the grout are thus required. The fluidity of the grout must be sufficient during injection, but has to decrease rapidly after a pre-determined period. Combined with an effective injection procedure, only the foundation masonry will be filled. The archaeological artefacts will thus be preserved. The grout has to be stable and bleeding must be under control. The compressive and bending strength must be sufficient and secured in time. The injectability of the grout in the foundations must be assured. The development of an appropriate grout for the injection of the <b>columns</b> <b>foundation</b> masonry will be described in this paper.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a graphical method to optimise {{the position of}} outriggers on shear walls with flexible foundations. This location for the outriggers will cause a maximum reduction in lateral deflection {{at the top of}} the building. The method can be used for preliminary design of high-rise structures subjected to horizontal loading. The method requires the calculation of six structural parameters: bending stiffnesses for the shear wall and outrigger structure, an overall bending stiffness contribution from the exterior columns, rotational stiffnesses for the shear wall and <b>column</b> <b>foundations</b> in addition to a newly suggested bending stiffness parameter representing the structural behaviour of the flexible foundation beam connecting the foundation of the shear wall to the exterior <b>column</b> <b>foundations.</b> These parameters allow the derivation of two compatibility equations for rotations at the intersections of the neutral lines of the shear wall with the outrigger and foundation structures. They yield expressions for the restraining moments at outrigger and foundation levels that act in the opposing direction to the bending moment from the horizontal loading on the structure. Maximising the influence of the restraining moments on the horizontal deflections leads to the optimum location of the outrigger structure. Combining all stiffness parameters into two non-dimensional characteristic structural parameters allows the optimisation procedure for this type of structure to be represented by a single graph that directly gives the optimum level of the outrigger. It is concluded that all six stiffness parameters need to be included in the preliminary analysis of a proposed tall building structure as the optimum location of the outrigger as well as the reductions in horizontal deformations and internal forces in the structure can be significantly influenced by all the structural components...|$|R
