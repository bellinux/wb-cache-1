Numerous prognostic tools have been proposed, including gene signatures. Unlike proliferation-related prognostic gene signatures, many immune-related gene signatures have emerged as principal biology-driven predictors of breast cancer. Diverse statistical methods and data sets were used for building these immune-related prognostic models, {{making it difficult to}} compare or use them in clinically meaningful ways. This study evaluated successfully published immune-related prognostic gene signatures through systematic validations of publicly available data sets. Eight prognostic models that were built upon immune-related gene signatures were evaluated. The performances of these models were compared and ranked in ten publicly available data sets, comprising a total of 2, 449 breast cancer cases. Predictive accuracies were measured as concordance indices (<b>C-indices).</b> All tests of statistical significance were two-sided. Immune-related gene models performed better in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) and lymph node-positive (LN+) breast cancer subtypes. The three top-ranked ER- breast cancer models achieved overall <b>C-indices</b> of 0. 62 – 0. 63. Two models predicted better than chance for ER+ breast cancer, with <b>C-indices</b> of 0. 53 and 0. 59, respectively. For LN+ breast cancer, four models showed predictive advantage, with <b>C-indices</b> between 0. 56 and 0. 61. Predicted prognostic values were positively correlated with ER status when evaluated using univariate analyses in most of the models under investigation. Multivariate analyses indicated that prognostic values of the three models were independent of known clinical prognostic factors. Collectively, these analyses provided a comprehensive evaluation of immune-related prognostic gene signatures. By synthesizing <b>C-indices</b> in multiple independent data sets, immune-related gene signatures were ranked for ER+, ER-, LN+, and LN- breast cancer subtypes. Taken together, these data showed that immune-related gene signatures have good prognostic values in breast cancer, especially for ER- and LN+ tumors.

BackgroundCPX and 6 MW tests are commonly applied as prognostic gauges for systolic HF patients, but few direct comparisons have been conducted. MethodsStable New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II and III systolic HF patients (ejection fraction ≤ 35 %) from the HF-ACTION (Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training) trial were studied. 6 MW distance (6 MWD) and CPX indices (peak oxygen consumption [VO 2] and ventilatory equivalents for exhaled carbon dioxide [VE/VCO 2] slope) were compared as predictors of all-cause mortality/hospitalization and all-cause mortality over 2. 5 years of mean follow-up. ResultsA total of 2, 054 HF-ACTION participants underwent both CPX and 6 MW tests at baseline (median age 59 years; 71 % male; 64 % NYHA functional class II and 36 % NYHA functional class III/IV). In unadjusted models and in models that included key clinical and demographic covariates, <b>C-indices</b> of 6 MWD were 0. 58 and 0. 65 (unadjusted) and 0. 62 and 0. 72 (adjusted) in predicting all-cause mortality/hospitalization and all-cause mortality, respectively. <b>C-indices</b> for peak VO 2 were 0. 61 and 0. 68 (unadjusted) and 0. 63 and 0. 73 (adjusted). <b>C-indices</b> for VE/VCO 2 slope were 0. 56 and 0. 65 (unadjusted) and 0. 61 and 0. 71 (adjusted); combining peak VO 2 and VE/VCO 2 slope did not improve the <b>C-indices.</b> Overlapping 95 % confidence intervals and modest integrated discrimination improvement values confirmed similar prognostic discrimination by 6 MWD and CPX indices within adjusted models.

Two major systems in current use are based on projections of risk or complexity that were predominantly subjectively derived. Our goal was to create an objective, empirically based index {{that can be used}} to identify the statistically estimated risk of in-hospital mortality by procedure and to group procedures into risk categories. MethodsMortality risk was estimated for 148 types of operative procedures using data from 77, 294 operations entered into the European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery (EACTS) Congenital Heart Surgery Database (33, 360 operations) and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Congenital Heart Surgery Database (43, 934 patients) between 2002 and 2007. Procedure-specific mortality rate estimates were calculated using a Bayesian model that adjusted for small denominators. Each procedure was assigned a numeric score (the STS–EACTS Congenital Heart Surgery Mortality Score [2009]) ranging from 0. 1 to 5. 0 based on the estimated mortality rate. Procedures were also sorted by increasing risk and grouped into 5 categories (the STS–EACTS Congenital Heart Surgery Mortality Categories [2009]) that were chosen to be optimal with respect to minimizing within-category variation and maximizing between-category variation. Model performance was subsequently assessed in an independent validation sample (n = 27, 700) and compared with 2 existing methods: Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS- 1) categories and Aristotle Basis Complexity scores. ResultsEstimated mortality rates ranged across procedure types from 0. 3 % (atrial septal defect repair with patch) to 29. 8 % (truncus plus interrupted aortic arch repair). The proposed STS–EACTS score and STS–EACTS categories demonstrated good discrimination for predicting mortality in the validation sample (<b>C-index</b> = 0. 784 and 0. 773, respectively). For procedures with more than 40 occurrences, the Pearson correlation coefficient between a procedure's STS–EACTS score and its actual mortality rate in the validation sample was 0. 80. In the subset of procedures for which RACHS- 1 and Aristotle Basic Complexity scores are defined, discrimination was highest for the STS–EACTS score (<b>C-index</b> = 0. 787), followed by STS–EACTS categories (<b>C-index</b> = 0. 778), RACHS- 1 categories (<b>C-index</b> = 0. 745), and Aristotle Basic Complexity scores (<b>C-index</b> = 0. 687). When patient covariates were added to each model, the <b>C-index</b> improved: STS–EACTS score (<b>C-index</b> = 0. 816), STS–EACTS categories (<b>C-index</b> = 0. 812), RACHS- 1 categories (<b>C-index</b> = 0. 802), and Aristotle Basic Complexity scores (<b>C-index</b> = 0. 795). ConclusionThe proposed risk scores and categories have a high degree of discrimination for predicting mortality and represent an improvement over existing consensus-based methods.

40|$|HCC is {{diagnosed}} in approximately {{half a million}} people per year, worldwide. Staging is a more complex issue than in most other cancer entities and, mainly due to unique geographic characteristics of the disease, no universally accepted staging system exists to date. Focusing on survival rates we analyzed demographic, etiological, clinical, laboratory and tumor characteristics of HCC-patients in our institution and applied the common staging systems. Furthermore we aimed at identifying the most suitable of the current staging systems for predicting survival. Overall, 405 patients with HCC were identified from an electronic medical record database. The following seven staging systems were applied and ranked according to their ability to predict survival by using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the concordance-index (<b>c-index)</b> : BCLC, CLIP, GETCH, JIS, Okuda, TNM and Child-Pugh. Separately, every single variable of each staging system was tested for prognostic meaning in uni- and multivariate analysis. Alcoholic cirrhosis (44. 4 %) was the leading etiological factor followed by viral hepatitis C (18. 8 %). Median survival was 18. 1 months (95 %-CI: 15. 2 - 22. 2). Ascites, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AFP, number of tumor nodes and the BCLC tumor extension remained independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. Overall, all of the tested staging systems showed a reasonable discriminatory ability. CLIP (closely followed by JIS) was the top-ranked score in terms of prognostic capability with the best values of the AIC and <b>c-index</b> (AIC 2286, <b>c-index</b> 0. 71), surpassing other established staging systems like BCLC (AIC 2343, <b>c-index</b> 0. 66). The unidimensional scores TNM (AIC 2342, <b>c-index</b> 0. 64) and Child-Pugh (AIC 2369, <b>c-index</b> 0. 63) performed in an inferior fashion.

AMADEUS was a multicentre, randomized, open-label non-inferiority study that compared fixed-dose idraparinux with conventional anticoagulation by dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonists. We performed a post hoc analysis {{to assess the impact of}} renal function on the outcomes of anticoagulated AF patients. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of stroke/systemic embolism (SE). The principal safety outcome of this analysis was major bleeding. We calculated <b>c-indexes,</b> reflecting the ability for discriminating diseased vs. non-diseased patients, and the net reclassification improvement (NRI, an index of inferior/superior performance of risk estimation scores). Of 4576 patients, 45 strokes and 103 major bleeding events occurred following an average follow-up of 325 ± 164 days. Patients with CrCl > 90 mL/min had an annual stroke/SE rate of 0. 6 % compared with 0. 8 % for those with CrCl 60 - 90 mL/min and 2. 2 % for those with CrCl < 60 mL/min (P < 0. 001 for linear association). After adjusting for stroke risk factors, patients with CrCl < 60 mL/min had more than two-fold higher risk of stroke/SE and almost 60 % higher risk of major bleeding compared with those with CrCl ≥ 60. In patients with the CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score 1 - 2, CrCl < 60 mL/min was associated with eight-fold higher stroke risk. When added to the CHA 2 DS 2 VASc or CHADS 2 scores, CrCl < 60 mL/min did not improve the <b>c-indexes</b> for CHADS 2 (P = 0. 054) or CHA 2 DS 2 VASc (P = 0. 63) but resulted in significant NRI (0. 26, P = 0. 02) in this anticoagulated trial cohort. Renal impairment (CrCl < 60 mL/min) doubles the risk of stroke and increased the risk of major bleeding by almost 60 % in anticoagulated patients with AF.

Logistic regression models were used for falls and death, while survival analyses were conducted for fractures. The FI and PF agreed with each other at a good level of consensus (correlation coefficients ≥ 0. 56) in all the three strategies. Both the FI and PF approaches predicted adverse health outcomes significantly. The FI quantified the risks of future falls, fractures and death more precisely than the PF.

40|$|MOTIVATION: Discrimination {{statistics}} {{describe the}} ability of a survival model to assign higher risks to individuals who experience earlier events: examples are Harrell's <b>C-index</b> and Royston and Sauerbrei's D, which we call the D-index. Prognostic covariates whose distributions are controlled by the study design (e. g. age and sex) influence discrimination and can make it difficult to compare model discrimination between studies. Although covariate adjustment is a standard procedure for quantifying disease-risk factor associations, there are no covariate adjustment methods for discrimination statistics in censored survival data. OBJECTIVE: To develop extensions of the <b>C-index</b> and D-index that describe the prognostic ability of a model adjusted for one or more covariate(s). METHOD: We define a covariate-adjusted <b>C-index</b> and D-index for censored survival data, propose several estimators, and investigate their performance in simulation studies and in data from a large individual participant data meta-analysis, the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration. RESULTS: The proposed methods perform well in simulations. In the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration data, the age-adjusted <b>C-index</b> and D-index were substantially smaller than unadjusted values. The study-specific standard deviation of baseline age was strongly associated with the unadjusted <b>C-index</b> and D-index but not significantly associated with the age-adjusted indices.

Although CAPRA-S was optimistic in predicting the likelihood of being free of recurrence at 5 yr, it outperformed the Stephenson nomogram on both calibration plots and decision curve analysis. The <b>c-index</b> for predicting cancer-specific mortality was 0. 85, with the caveat that this number is based on only 61 events. Conclusions In this external validation, the CAPRA-S score predicted recurrence and mortality after RP with a <b>c-index</b> > 0. 70. The score is an effective prognostic tool that may aid in determining the need for adjuvant therapy. © 2013 European Association of Urology...|$|E
40|$|The {{prognostic}} improvement {{attributed to}} genetic markers over current prognostic system {{has not been}} well studied for melanoma. The goal {{of this study is}} to evaluate the added prognostic value of Vitamin D Pathway (VitD) SNPs to currently known clinical and demographic factors such as age, sex, Breslow thickness, mitosis and ulceration (CDF). We utilized two large independent well-characterized melanoma studies: the Genes, Environment, and Melanoma (GEM) and MD Anderson studies, and performed variable selection of VitD pathway SNPs and CDF using Random Survival Forest (RSF) method in addition to Cox proportional hazards models. The Harrell's <b>C-index</b> was used to compare the performance of model predictability. The population-based GEM study enrolled 3, 578 incident cases of cutaneous melanoma (CM), and the hospital-based MD Anderson study consisted of 1, 804 CM patients. Including both VitD SNPs and CDF yielded <b>C-index</b> of 0. 85, which provided slight but not significant improvement by CDF alone (<b>C-index</b> = 0. 83) in the GEM study. Similar results were observed in the independent MD Anderson study (<b>C-index</b> = 0. 84 and 0. 83, respectively). The Cox model identified no significant associations after adjusting for multiplicity. Our results do not support clinically significant prognostic improvements attributable to VitD pathway SNPs over current prognostic system for melanoma survival...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{incremental}} prognostic {{value of}} admission measurements of biomarkers beyond clinical characteristics {{and extent of}} coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unclear. Methods Centrally analyzed plasma for biomarker measurements was available in 5, 385 of the STEMI patients treated with PPCI in the PLATO trial. Extent of CAD was graded by operators in association with PPCI. We evaluated the prognostic value of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF- 15) beyond clinical characteristics and extent of CAD using Cox proportional hazards analyses, <b>C-index,</b> and net reclassification improvement (NRI). Outcomes were cardiovascular death (CVD) and spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI). Results Angiographic data on extent of CAD improved the prediction of CVD compared to clinical risk factors alone, increasing the <b>C-index</b> from 0. 760 to 0. 778, total NRI of 0. 31. Biomarker information provided additional prognostic value for CVD beyond clinical risk factors and extent of CAD, C-indices ranging from 0. 792 to 0. 795 for all biomarkers, but with a higher NRI for NT-proBNP. Extent of CAD and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T were not associated with spontaneous MI. The prediction of spontaneous MI beyond clinical characteristics and extent of CAD (<b>C-index</b> 0. 647) was improved by both NT-proBNP (<b>C-index</b> 0. 663, NRI 0. 22) and GDF- 15 (<b>C-index</b> 0. 652, NRI 0. 05). Conclusions Biomarker measurement on admission is feasible and provides incremental risk stratification in patients with STEMI treated with PPCI, with NT-proBNP and GDF- 15 being most valuable due to the association with both CVD and spontaneous MI...|$|E
40|$|Background. Bibliometrics are an {{essential}} aspect of measuring academic and organizational performance. Aim. This review seeks to describe methods for measuring bibliometrics, identify {{the strengths and}} limitations of methodologies, outline strategies for interpretation, summarise evaluation of nursing and midwifery performance, identify implications for metric of evaluation, and specify the implications for nursing and midwifery and implications of social networking for bibliometrics and measures of individual performance. Method. A review of electronic databases CINAHL, Medline, and Scopus was undertaken using search terms such as bibliometrics, nursing, and midwifery. The reference lists of retrieved articles and Internet sources and social media platforms were also examined. Results. A number of well-established, formal ways of assessment have been identified, including h- and <b>c-indices.</b> Changes in publication practices {{and the use of}} the Internet have challenged traditional metrics of influence. Moreover, measuring impact beyond citation metrics is an increasing focus, with social media representing newer ways of establishing performance and impact. Conclusions. Even though a number of measures exist, no single bibliometric measure is perfect. Therefore, multiple approaches to evaluation are recommended. However, bibliometric approaches should not be the only measures upon which academic and scholarly performance are evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Background-We aim to {{identify}} and quantify the value of biomarkers for incident new-onset heart failure (HF) in a community-based cohort and subgroups based on cardiovascular risk and evaluate the prognostic value of 13 biomarkers for HF with reduced and preserved ejection fraction. Methods and Results-Thirteen biomarkers reflecting diverse pathophysiologic domains were examined in 8569 HF-free participants in Prevention of Vascular and Renal Endstage Disease (mean age, 49 years; 50 % men). Subjects were categorized in 2 risk groups based on cardiovascular history. Incremental value per biomarker was assessed using Harrell <b>C-indices.</b> One hundred sixty-eight subjects (2. 4 %) were diagnosed with new-onset HF in the low-risk group (n= 6915; Framingham Risk Score, 5. 9 %) and 206 (12. 2 %) subjects in the high-risk group (n= 1654; Framingham Risk Score, 18. 6 %). The association of natriuretic peptides, adrenomedullin, endothelin, and galectin- 3 with new-onset HF was stronger in the high-risk group (all P Conclusions-Risk stratification increases the incremental value per biomarker to predict new-onset HF, especially HF with reduced ejection fraction.

40|$|The patient´s {{survival}} {{estimate is}} important for clinical decision-making, especially in frail patients with multimorbidities. We aimed to develop a multidimensional geriatric prognosis index (GPI) for 3 - and 5 -year mortality in community-dwelling elderly and to validate the GPI in a separate hospital-based population. The GPI was constructed using data for 988 participants in the Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging (KLoSHA) and cross-validated with 1109 patients who underwent a geriatric assessment at the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH). The GPI, with a total possible score of 8, included age, gender, activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, comorbidities, mood, cognitive function, and nutritional status. During the 5 -year observation period, 179 KLoSHA participants (18. 1 %) and 340 SNUBH patients (30. 7 %) died. The <b>c-indices</b> for 3 - and 5 -year mortality were 0. 78 and 0. 80, respectively, in the KLoSHA group and 0. 73 and 0. 80, respectively, in the SNUBH group. Positive linear trends were observed for GPI scores and both 3 - and 5 -year mortality in both groups. In conclusions, using common components of a geriatric assessment, the GPI can stratify the risk of 3 - and 5 -year mortality in Korean elderly people both {{in the community and}} hospital...|$|R
30|$|Kaplan Meier {{method was}} used to {{estimate}} the median OS of the baseline and of the treatment follow-up patient cohorts. Concordance index (<b>C-index)</b> and its standard error (SE) {{was used to}} evaluate the discriminatory strength of the automated BSI in predicting OS [10]. To determine the additive strength of automated BSI as a biomarker, we compared the discrimination, <b>C-index</b> values [11], of the blood-based model to that of the blood-based model incorporating the automated BSI. <b>C-index</b> would allow the evaluation of the additive clinical value of automated BSI as a continuous covariate over the blood biomarkers, without stratifying the data with an arbitrary threshold. A strong concordance would indicate that the covariate is highly informative in predicting the relative risk of death between any two patients at a given time. Statistical significance for each statistical test was set at 0.05 (two-tailed). All statistical analyses were performed using R software version 3.1. 2.|$|E
40|$|Physical {{performance}} {{is an important}} predictor of mortality, but little is known on the comparative prognostic utility of different objective physical performance tests in community-dwelling older adults. We compared the prognostic usefulness of several objective physical performance tests on mortality, adjusting our analyses for potential confounders. Among 3, 099 older community-dwelling participants included in the Progetto Veneto Anziani study, 2, 096 were followed for a mean of 4. 4 years. Physical performance tests measured were Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), 4 -meter gait speed, chair stands time, leg extension and flexion, handgrip strength, and 6 -Minute Walking Test (6 MWT), treated as continuous variables and categorized in gender-specific quartiles. The main outcome was mortality assessed with death certificates. Participants who died during the follow-up (n = 327) scored significantly worse in all physical performance tests measured at baseline than those who survived (n = 1, 769).

40|$|Objectives: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{severity}} {{is associated with}} patient prognosis. However, few efficient scoring systems {{have been developed to}} screen severe CAD in patients with stable angina and suspected CAD before coronary angiography. Here, we present a novel scoring system for CAD severity before elective coronary angiography. Methods: Five hundred fifty-one patients with stable angina who were admitted for coronary angiography were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into training (n = 347) and validation (n = 204) cohorts. Severe CAD was defined as having a Gensini score of 20 or more. All patients underwent echocardiography (ECG) to detect ejection fraction and aortic valve calcification (AVC). Multivariable analysis was applied to determine independent risk factors and develop the scoring system. Results: In the training cohort, age, male sex, AVC, abnormal ECG, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were identified as independent factors for severe CAD by multivariable analysis, and the Severe Prediction Scoring (SPS) system was developed. <b>C-indices</b> of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for severe CAD were 0. 744 and 0. 710 in the training and validation groups, respectively. The SPS system also performed well during calibration, as demonstrated by Hosmer-Lemeshow analysis in the validation group.

40|$|Background—Risk {{stratification}} is {{an integral}} component of clinical decision-making in heart failure (HF). Women with HF have unique characteristics compared to men, and it is unknown whether common prognostic factors are equally useful in both populations. We aimed to investigate whether sex-specific risk models are more accurate for risk prediction in patients with advanced HF. Methods and Results—Advanced HF patients referred to UCLA (n= 2, 255) were stratified by sex into derivation (referred in 2000 - 2007) and validation (referred in 2008 - 2011) cohorts. Cox regression {{analysis was used to}} ascertain key variables predictive of the primary end point of death/urgent transplantation/ventricular assist device in the derivation cohorts and confirmed in the validation cohorts in men, women, and the total population. Women were younger, with higher ejection fraction, and better event-free survival. Despite differences in baseline characteristics, the four strongest predictors of outcome in both women and men, {{as well as in the}} total cohort, were B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), peak oxygen consumption by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (pkVO 2), New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, and use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).

40|$|The {{model of}} end-stage liver disease (MELD) score {{is often used}} for liver graft allocation, and {{patients}} with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receive exception points (22 in the US). A better model is desirable for patients with HCC as {{they tend to have}} a privileged access to transplantation, without taking HCC characteristics into account. A new simpler model designed from a training set of US patients (n = 49 026) was tested on two validation sets (US and UK patient cohorts with, respectively, n = 20 475 and n = 1781). The risk of dropout was between 3. 2 and 7. 8 % at 3 months in patients with HCC, and was captured into a score, including HCC size, HCC number, AFP, and MELD (- 37. 8 + 1. 9 *MELD+ 5. 9 if HCC Nb ≥ 2 + 5. 9 if AFP > 400 + 21. 2 if HCC size > 1 cm). This new model could be validated on external US and UK liver candidate cohorts. It provides a dynamic and more accurate assessment of dropout than the use of exception MELD (<b>C-indices</b> of 66. 2 - 73. 7 % vs. 52. 7 - 56. 6 %). In addition, the model shows a similar distribution as MELD for patients with non-HCC, and both scores could be used in parallel for the management of waiting-list patients with and without HCC...|$|R
