50|$|Traditionally, the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches {{used the}} Julian Calendar to {{calculate}} their feast days. Beginning in 1924 the Patriarchate of Constantinople made an adjustment to their liturgical year {{to bring the}} fixed cycle in conformity to the modern Gregorian Calendar. The Paschal cycle, however, continued to be calculated according to the Julian Calendar. This <b>composite</b> <b>calendar</b> {{is known as the}} Revised Julian Calendar. Constantinople's example was followed by the Church of Greece {{as well as a number}} of other autocephalous churches. Today, some churches continue to follow the Julian Calendar while others follow the Revised Julian Calendar. Only the Orthodox Church of Finland has adopted the Western calculation of the date of Pascha (see computus); all other Orthodox Churches, and a number of Eastern Catholic Churches, celebrate Pascha at the same time, according to the ancient rules.|$|E
