Four soil textures of varying fineness (Loamy Sand, Loam, Silty Loam, and Sandy Loam) and three negative pressure values (0, – 5, and – 10 kPa) were used. As irrigation time increased, wetting front movement speeds decreased, and as negative pressure increased, wetting front size decreased. <b>Coarse</b> <b>soils</b> had the smallest wetting front under greater negative pressure. Next, water infiltration rate decreased as irrigation time increased, and <b>coarse</b> <b>soils</b> had the lowest average infiltration rate under greater negative pressure. Finally, salt content increased with distance from the irrigation emitter and with increased negative pressure. Further, <b>coarse</b> <b>soils</b> {{were found to have}} decreased desalination under greater negative pressure. Thus, soil texture has a strong effect on NPI efficiency. However, by adjusting pressure values in accordance with soil texture, soil water content can be controlled and maintained.

The shear-strength behavior during this drainage period resembles that of uniform coarse sand.

The clay aggregates become unsaturated in the second mode as the pore water drains from the intraaggregate pores.
