5|$|A giant <b>clone</b> of Keniclius, named Keniclius Five, kidnaps First Officer Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy). He {{believes}} the galaxy is as war-ravaged as Earth {{was when he}} left it. He plans to enforce peace on the galaxy {{with the aid of}} a fleet of Phylosian ships and a giant <b>clone</b> of Spock that he's created, at the expense of the original Spock's life. The newly awakened giant Spock <b>clone</b> uses his Vulcan telepathic abilities to mind meld with his original self and save his life. The two Spocks, in concert with Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner), convince Keniclius that the need for his plan no longer exists. Spock Two and Dr. Keniclius Five devote themselves to restoring the Phylosian civilization as the original departs with his shipmates.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe two novel {{methods for}} DNA <b>cloning</b> {{presented}} {{here have been}} developed for the rapid construction of vectors used for insertion of genes in filamentous fungi. The current study shows that both simpleUSER <b>cloning</b> and nicking <b>cloning</b> can substitute USER <b>cloning</b> for insertion of single PCR fragments into plasmids. The simpleUSER <b>cloning</b> method proposed in this paper varies from USER <b>cloning</b> by substituting the dual enzymatic plasmid preparation step with a single enzymatic step. The other method further abolishes the use of USER™ enzyme mix and PfuTurbo Cx polymerase, and is referred to as nicking <b>cloning.</b> We show that both simpleUSER <b>cloning</b> and nicking <b>cloning</b> can substitute USER <b>cloning</b> for insertion of single PCR fragments into plasmids, and that the combination of these two methods works efficiently for the construction of selective plasmids and plasmids for co-transformation. This strategy was applied to genetically modify the filamentous fungus Aspergillus carbonarius. The two methods simplify DNA <b>cloning</b> by reducing time and complexity associated with <b>cloning</b> in filamentous fungi...|$|R

40|$|We find {{an optimal}} quantum <b>cloning</b> machine, which <b>clones</b> qubits of {{arbitrary}} symmetrical distribution around the Bloch vector {{with the highest}} fidelity.

40|$|Imprinting {{disorders}} {{induced by}} somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) usually {{lead to the}} abnormalities of <b>cloned</b> animals and low <b>cloning</b> efficiency. Histone deacetylase inhibitors {{have been shown to}} improve gene expression, genomic methylation reprogramming and the development of <b>cloned</b> embryos, however, the imprinting statuses in these treated embryos and during their subsequent development remain poorly studied. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of H 19 /Igf 2 methylation and transcription in porcine <b>cloned</b> embryos treated with trichostatin A (TSA), and examined H 19 /Igf 2 imprinting patterns in <b>cloned</b> fetuses and piglets. Our results showed that compared with the maintenance of H 19 /Igf 2 methylation in fertilized embryos, <b>cloned</b> embryos displayed aberrant H 19 /Igf 2 methylation and lower H 19 /Igf 2 transcripts. When TSA enhanced the development of <b>cloned</b> embryos, the disrupted H 19 /Igf 2 imprinting was largely rescued in these treated embryos, more similar to those detected in fertilized counterparts. Further studies displayed that TSA effectively rescued the disrupted imprinting of H 19 /Igf 2 in <b>cloned</b> fetuses and piglets, prevented the occurrence of <b>cloned</b> fetus and piglet abnormalities, and enhanced the full-term development of <b>cloned</b> embryos. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that aberrant imprinting induced by SCNT led to the abnormalities of <b>cloned</b> fetuses and piglets and low <b>cloning</b> efficiency, and TSA rescued the disrupted imprinting in <b>cloned</b> embryos, fetuses and piglets, and prevented the occurrence of <b>cloned</b> fetus and piglet abnormalities, thereby improving the development of <b>cloned</b> embryos.

40|$|Abstract—Code <b>cloning</b> {{has both}} {{positive}} and negative impacts on software maintenance and evolution.
