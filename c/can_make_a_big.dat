500|$|Former U.S. Navy admirals who {{head the}} U.S. Naval Institute have raised {{concerns}} about {{what they see as}} the ability to respond to [...] "aggressive moves by Iran and China". As part of the pivot to the Pacific, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said that the Navy would switch from a 50/50 split between the Pacific and the Atlantic to a 60/40 percent split that favored the Pacific, but the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Jonathan Greenert, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, have said that this would not mean [...] "a big influx of troops or ships in the Western Pacific". This pivot is a continuation of the trend towards the Pacific that first saw the Cold War's focus against the Soviet Union with 60 percent of the American submarine fleet stationed in the Atlantic shift towards an even split between the coasts and then in 2006, 60 percent of the submarines stationed on the Pacific side to counter China. The pivot is not entirely about numbers as some of the most advanced platforms will now have a Pacific focus, where their capabilities are most needed. However even a single incident <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> dent in a fleet of modest size with global missions.|$|E

Considerably narrowing the widening state-society gap, however, it has endowed Iran with a normative surge of soft power, ripening the ground for a new way of statecraft that can bring about a whole change of identity for the state.

40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} role of the bio-fuels {{production}} in the transportation sector in the world, for programs of greenhouse gases emissions reductions and sustainable environmental performance. Depending on the methodology used to account for the local pollutant emissions and the global greenhouse gases emissions during the production and consumption of both the fossil and bio-fuels, the results can show huge differences. If it is taken into account a life cycle inventory approach to compare the different fuel sources, these results can present controversies. A comparison study involving the American oil diesel and soybean diesel developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory presents CO 2 emissions for the bio-diesel which are almost 20 % of the emissions for the oil diesel: 136 Â g CO 2 /bhp-h for the bio-diesel from soybean and 633 Â g CO 2 /bhp-h for the oil diesel [National Renewable Energy Laboratory [...] NREL/SR- 580 - 24089].

Regions {{going through a}} natural resource boom tend to have higher average incomes and employment relative {{to the rest of}} the country. For policy analysis, a question that often needs to be answered is to what extent the economic growth in the extraction region spills over to neighboring areas. This thesis develops a detailed methodology for analyzing the economic effects of geographically localized shocks within the framework of a parsimonious spatial general equilibrium model, including various methods for estimating key parameters. This model-based approach is being offered as a complementary tool for applied researchers conducting economic impact analysis. Existing empirical methods such as input-output analysis or difference-in-difference estimation techniques are often not optimal for analyzing spatially correlated data, and this model-based methodology can be used to overcome their limitations. Another important advantage of this methodology is that it is computationally tractable and has a relatively low data requirement, which <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> particularly <b>big</b> difference in studying developing countries where data quality and availability can often be an insurmountable challenge. Following the exposition of the methodology, this thesis presents two separate applications, one involving a developed nation and the other a developing one. In the first case, the methodology is applied to analyze the economic impact of the shale energy boom that's been occurring in and around Bakken counties in western North Dakota and eastern Montana over the past decade. In the second case, the methodology is used to analyze the economic impact of the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mining project in the Southern Gobi region of Mongolia. A common conclusion that is drawn from the two applications mentioned above is that economic booms fueled by natural resource extracting industries are largely local and have limited spillover effects on neighboring regions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we generalize a {{one-dimensional}} optimal control problem with DNSS property to a two-dimensional optimal control problem. This {{is done by}} taking the direct product of the model with itself, i. e. we combine two similar system dynamics under a joint objective functional that is separable in both states and controls. This framework {{can be applied to}} the construction of various optimal control problems, such as optimal marketing of related products, optimal growth of separate but interacting economies, or optimal control of two related capital stocks. We study such a system for a particular case drawn from the domain of drug control. The main result of this paper is that in this domain even a modest amount of interaction <b>can</b> sometimes <b>make</b> <b>a</b> very <b>big</b> difference. Hence, drawing conclusions by simplifying the real world into two independent, one-dimensional models may be problematic. Methodologically the combination of two systems with DNSS property leads to a fascinating series of situations with multiple optimal steady states and associated threshold behavior. These instances reflect some important recent developments in optimal dynamic control theory.

Yes, grantmakers say, as long as members define their goals, set clear operational guidelines, and work from the start to make the collaborative function well for grantees. In this guide, contributors share strategies for structuring a collaborative to fit its purpose, building strong relationships and resolving conflicts, and figuring out if the collaborative you're in is working. Contributors also offer ample proof that collaboratives are leading the field in bringing the voices of nonfunders - grantees, intended beneficiaries, experts, and others - into the process of making grants.

Getting Serious about Funder Collaboration: After years of hearing that more collaboration would be a good thing, funders seem to be getting beyond the talk and finding new ways to work together. Focus and Function: Designing a Collaborative to Fit the Purpose: A collaborative takes shape when a group of grantmakers recognize that they share a common focus [...] and that they might be able to do more together than they can on their own. The next step is figuring out how to structure a collaborative to serve the function they have in mind. This section outlines three basic types, with examples of each. Organizing for Good Relationships and Outcomes: A collaborative runs on the power of its relationships, which can run a little more cleanly if the group takes time to set some simple ground rules.

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 NHL season, Panthers head coach Peter DeBoer, who first saw Horton play at seven years old, said about his hopes for Horton, [...] "If I'm looking for guys to do more, he wouldn't be at the top of the list. If he can give us 30-plus, I'd be happy with Nathan. There's a group of guys {{underneath}} him that I think <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> lot <b>bigger</b> jumps than I need out of Nathan Horton goal-wise." [...] Horton was also moved from his position of right wing to centre before the season. After playing a few games at centre, Horton said, [...] "It's not as easy as wing. You can play wing and all you have to concentrate on is getting the puck and shooting it. At center, you have more responsibilities." [...] Against the Nashville Predators on November 1, Horton played in his 300th career game, but failed to record a point. On November 26, Horton suffered a deep cut in his leg after it was stepped on by a skate. At the time of the injury, Horton had 6 goals and 7 assists. In early December, the Ottawa Sun reported that the Panthers might have been looking to trade Horton after he was reportedly unhappy playing for the team. Horton returned to the lineup on December 17 after missing eight games. After the game, Horton commented, [...] "I'm excited to play. It's kind of a different Panthers team than the past. It's really changed in a matter of a month. Things are going good now, and everybody's really buying into what Pete has been telling us all year." [...] On January 17, Horton recorded 3 assists to help the Panthers defeat Tampa Bay, 43. For the second time during the season, Horton's name came up in trade rumours, this time with the Chicago Blackhawks. In early March, days after the trade deadline, Horton suffered a finger injury that forced him to have surgery. He returned to the lineup on March 23, recording an assist in a Panthers loss to the Carolina Hurricanes. Horton ended the season with 22 goals and 23 assists in 67 games.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I discuss {{two very}} {{different}} language communities: the Kiowa tribe in southwestern Oklahoma and the Saulteaux Ojibwe first nation in Manitoba. Kiowa is a critically endangered language with only 10 native speakers, all nearing the age of 90. Revitalization efforts have been intermittent over the last 40 years, and little has helped. Saulteaux Ojibwe, while also endangered, is much healthier with 10, 000 native speakers, {{some of whom are}} teachers with linguistic training actively conducting their own research. Drawing from my experience, I show that these marked differences lead to distinct needs and thus different directions for researchers to give back to the communities. I detail two general approaches that any linguist should be able to adopt in similar communities. The Kiowa tribe has little access to audio recordings of their language because the recordings were not digitized and/or copies were never provided. They have not seen a number of the resulting papers and books from previous researchers, and the only comprehensive dictionary is from the 1920 s. In the words of one of my consultants: “If there was a dictionary with the sounds, too, I could die. I’m one of the last ones who knows how you’re supposed to pronounce things, and it will be lost forever without something like that. ” While it is true that not everyone is equipped to commit to a full dictionary project, by doing research as we would anyway we <b>can</b> still <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> impact. Namely, <b>a</b> linguist can amass the available data in preparing their own research (search for previous recordings, contact other scholars, scan articles and books) and also be sure to give copies of those materials directly to the community (e. g. a museum, library, or community center). There are already online dictionaries and educational applications for the many dialects of Ojibwe, making research and data more readily available to the community and interested researchers. Thus, the community requires a markedly different approach than that of the Kiowa tribe. Namely, the Saulteaux Ojibwe community’s language teachers and researchers, working {{on the front lines of}} language revitalization, are seeking validation and support. In the spirit of more collaborative fieldwork (e. g., Mannix et al. 2015, Brooke Lillehaugen p. c.), we should look to work with the native community in the production and dissemination of the research (e. g. co-authoring papers, presentations, and grants), bringing our skills (and data) to the table of ongoing projects...|$|R
