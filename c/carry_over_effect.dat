40|$|Task {{demands that}} {{influence}} scanning behaviour in one task can cause that behaviour to persist {{to a second}} unrelated task (carry over). This can also affect performance on a second task (e. g., hazard perception ratings), and {{has been attributed to}} a process of attentional bias that is modulated by top-down influences (Thompson & Crundall, 2011). In a series of experiments we explored how these top-down influences impact upon carry over. In all experiments, participants searched letters that were presented horizontally, vertically, or in a random array. They were then presented with a driving scene and rated the hazardousness of the scene. Carry over of eye-movements from the letter search to the scene was observed in all experiments. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that this <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effect</b> influenced hazard perception accuracy. The magnitude of carry over was correlated with task switching abilities, attentional conflicting, and attentional orienting (Experiment 1), and was affected by predictability of the primary task (Experiment 2). Furthermore, direct current stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal areas affected the magnitude of the effect (Experiment 3). These results indicate that carry over is modulated by the specific ability to orient attention and disengage from this orientation. Over orienting leads to increased carry over and insufficient task switching is detrimental to task performance. As a result the current experiments provide evidence that the <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effect</b> is strongly influenced by attentional processes, namely orienting, inhibition, and task switching...|$|E

Evaluation of agronomic performance of identified elite strains of J. curcas in marginal lands would be of paramount importance for addressing gap areas in their agronomic properties and subsequently for harnessing their optimum economic potentials. The present study undertook the task of analysing the growth performance of a high oil bearing elite strain of J. curcas–DARL- 2 in degraded land in semi-arid zone of Deccan Plateau, India. While undertaking the assessment of growth performance of elite strain DARL- 2, two other native (wild) strains (namely AHN- 1 and AHN- 2) of J. curcas were also considered so that a comparative evaluation could be carried out.

Beginning 21 d before expected parturition, cows were fed either a control diet or a diet containing glycerol (5 % of DM). After parturition, cows were assigned to one of four treatments in a 2 (dietary glycerol; 3. 3 % of DM) X 2 (glycerol drench; 500 ml/d for 5 d beginning at parturition) factorial arrangement. From d 22 through 63 of lactation, cows were fed the same diet. Feeding glycerol during the prepartum period increased prepartum DMI, but feeding glycerol during the postpartum period tended to decrease postpartum DMI and drenching glycerol for the first 5 d of lactation decreased postpartum DMI. Milk yield was not affected by feeding glycerol during either the prepartum or postpartum periods or drenching glycerol during the first 5 d of lactation. Percentages and yields of milk fat and true protein were not affected by feeding glycerol during either the prepartum or postpartum periods; however, drenching glycerol tended to decrease milk protein content and decreased milk lactose content. Glycerol fed during the prepartum period resulted in no significant effects on plasma glucose, NEFA or BHBA concentrations during the prepartum period with no <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effects</b> on postpartum metabolites. Prepartum incorporation of glycerol in the diet resulted in no significant effects in liver triglycerides or glycogen content in liver samples collected d 1 after calving compared with control cows with no <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effects</b> on postpartum liver triglycerides or glycogen content. Postpartum incorporation of glycerol in the diet resulted in no significant effects on postpartum liver composition. Short term (5 -d) oral drenching of glycerol beginning at calving resulted in no significant effects on liver composition (d 10 and 21 postpartum) or on plasma glucose and NEFA. However, there was a trend for an increase in BHBA concentrations for cows drenched with glycerol. Intensive blood sampling performed on d 5 post calving demonstrated that a 500 ml oral bolus of crude glycerine significantly decreased plasma NEFA concentration with no overall significant effects on plasma glucose, BHBA, or insulin. Overall, incorporation of glycerol in to the diets of transition cows or the short-term oral drench of glycerol at calving resulted in few positive performance responses and only modest effects on metabolic variables studied.

The paper looks at this problem of optimal allocation of limited resources to maximize an objective function within the context of media mix modeling.

The algorithm uses an iteration method to obtain the value of the objective function for all potential allocations. The allocation that maximizes the objective function can then be chosen as the most favorable media mix. Since the method works with the transformed variables, non linear transformations and complicated carryover effects can be incorporated within this structure. This allows for a more realistic estimation of media impacts. 2...|$|R

Migratory species, especially long-distance migrants, are ideal models for exploring the relationship between warming temperatures on temperate breeding grounds and decreased precipitation on tropical wintering areas. Few studies have long term data sets to observe species-specific assessments of fitness in relation to changing precipitation and temperature patterns, and those that have assessed these relationships show inconsistent results. We analyzed long-term data of a neo-tropical migratory songbird (Protonotaria citrea) to assess the potential relationships between indices of reproductive success and variation in tropical rainfall and breeding season temperature. We found that the species tended to have longer breeding seasons in years with increased annual temperatures and increased rates of double brooding with increased precipitation in the wintering grounds. Prothonotary warblers had smaller first clutches in stronger El Nino years, though this relationship was weak. Breeding ground precipitation was not correlated with any index of reproductive success.

The correlation of the somatic cell count with bacterial findings in the subclinical range and features of milk production were studied. Total milk count was compared with the quarter foremilk samples. The data for the Study I was collected at two different Brandenburg dairy enterprises. 1570 dairy cows belonging to different lactation were tested monthly between June 1992 and December 1995 from the official milk sample records. In the study II quarter foremilk samples were analysed weekly between day 5 and 90 and biweekly between day 91 and 240 of lactation. Milk samples were collected and cultured for bacteria every six weeks. The average 305 day milk production was 5476 kg (enterprise A) and 5547 kg (enterprise B) and the average somatic cell score was 3. 86 (A) and 3. 48 (B). The somatic cell count was lowest in the first lactation and became larger with later lactations. The greatest difference was found between first and second lactation. Within the lactation the somatic cell count was lowest during the early lactation and rose {{toward the end of}} lactation, especially after week 40 of lactation. The Schwarzbunte Milchrind had the highest somatic cell count compared to Holstein frisian (enterprise A) and tschechisches Fleckvieh and tschechische Schwarzbunte (enterprise B). There was an inverse relationship between the cell count index and the daily milk yield. The phenotypic correlation was slightly negative with rp= -. 24 and was calculated with the total milk count. This correlation was confirmed for later lactations {{as well as for the}} different parts of the lactation. The phenotypic correlation between somatic cell count and the percentage of lactose showed similar values; rp= -. 37. For later lactations as well as for the different stages of lactation the values were similar. Dairy cows with a cell count lower than 50, 000 /ml milk had a significant higher daily milk yield than cows with a cell count of more than 50, 000 /ml milk. For lactose: cows with a cell count of more than 150, 000 /ml milk had a significant lower daily milk yield compared to the cows with a cell count lower than 50, 000 /ml milk. The correlations between somatic cell count and the percentage of fat/protein were 0. The correlation between the cell count index at the end of the first lactation and the beginning of the second lactation was slightly positive with rp=. 29. A <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effect</b> on the influence of the cell count index on health was proven with cows that were healthy at the beginning of the second lactation; the somatic cell score, the daily milk yield and the percentage of the lactose were all affected. The <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effect</b> was not shown in cows with a higher somatic cell score at the beginning of the following lactation as the <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effect</b> was drown by diseases. The most frequent causes for mastitis were: Staphylococci, Sc. Agalactiae and other Streptococci. Pathogen levels were slightly lower in the rear quarter of the udder. Milk samples with positive bacterial cultures had a significantly higher cell count index than milk samples with negative bacterial cultures (SCS= 0. 79). The highest cell count index was found in the milk samples with proof of Streptococci (SCS= 3. 74). It was slightly lower with proof of Sc. Agalactiae (SCS= 3. 1). Staphylococci caused a moderate increase in the cell count index (SCS= 2. 67). The percentage of lactose was substantially lower in the milk samples with positive bacteriological findings and higher (4. 93 %) in milk samples with negative bacteriological findings. In Streptococci positive samples the percentage of lactose was 4. 75 %, Sc. agalactiae 4. 78 % and in Staphylococci positive samples lactose was a little higher at 4. 85 %. When quarter foremilk samples were compared with the total milk count, agreement was found when the limit of the somatic cell count was exceeded. The use of somatic cell count in the total milk count was only moderately suitable for the proof of quarters when the somatic cell count was higher than 100, 000 /ml milk. The higher somatic cell count in one quarter vs the analysis of the total milk count showed only a 59 % sensitivity. The rest of the cows (unhealthy cows?) remain unidentified using only the total milk count.

Despite several merits, metabolomics based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a developing area that is yet attached to several pitfalls and challenges. To reach a level of high reliability and robustness, these issues need to be tackled by implementation of refined experimental and computational protocols. OBJECTIVES: This study illustrates some key pitfalls in LC-MS based metabolomics and introduces an automated computational procedure to compensate for them. METHOD: Non-cancerous mammary gland derived cells were exposed to 27 chemicals from four pharmacological classes plus a set of six pesticides. Changes in the metabolome of cell lysates were assessed after 24  h using LC-MS. A data processing pipeline was established and evaluated to handle issues including contaminants, <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effects,</b> intensity decay and inherent methodology variability and biases. A key component in this pipeline is a latent variable method called OOS-DA (optimal orthonormal system for discriminant analysis), being theoretically more easily motivated than PLS-DA in this context, as it is rooted in pattern classification rather than regression modeling. RESULT: The pipeline is shown to reduce experimental variability/biases and is used to confirm that LC-MS spectra hold drug class specific information. CONCLUSION: LC-MS based metabolomics is a promising methodology, but comes with pitfalls and challenges. Key difficulties can be largely overcome {{by means of a}} computational procedure of the kind introduced and demonstrated here.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} crops or different management practices on water erosion {{have been widely}} evaluated in plot or field experiments. While these experiments focus on the direct effects of a certain crop there is comparably little information on how a crop influences the soil loss during the following years. Our objectives were to evaluate to which extend water erosion differs between potato and maize and how these crops influence soil loss of a following winter wheat. Soil erosion was measured in four small neighboring watersheds (0. 8 to 4. 2 ha in size) during 198 rainfall-runoff events (1994 to 2001). Each watershed includes one field with a crop rotation of winter wheat, potato, winter wheat, and maize. This rotation was shifted by one year for each field, and hence a vertical comparison between the fields {{as well as a}} horizontal comparison over two crop rotations was possible. Runoff and soil loss from potato and maize differed only slightly because the better protection by cover during maize years was compensated by a better protection by contouring with potato ridges. Both effects were adequately described by the CP factor of the RUSLE. A clear difference in the soil loss depending on the preceding crop occurred in the following winter wheat fields. Especially in October, November and February the soil loss after potato was significantly higher. This could be explained by little residue cover, disintegration of large aggregates and low stability of small aggregates following potato. <b>Carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effects</b> should be taken into account optimizing crop rotations in respect to soil-conservation; moreover they are highly relevant for the modeling of water erosion from agricultural areas...|$|R
40|$|Dallas and Merikle (1976 a, 1976 b) {{demonstrated}} that when participants 					were {{presented with a}} pair of words for over 1 s and subsequently cued to 					pronounce one of the words aloud (postcue task) semantic priming effects 					occurred. Humphreys, Lloyd-Jones, and Fias (1995) failed to replicate this postcue semantic priming effect using 					word pairs that were semantic category co-ordinates. The aim of Experiment 1 was 					to determine if the disparate postcue task results reported by these researchers 					could be accounted for by the prime-target contexts or cue types engaging 					different attentional processes or a combination of these factors. A postcue 					pronunciation task was used and word pairs presented were taken from an 					associate-semantic context and a semantic category context. In the Dallas and 					Merikle condition the line cue flanked the location in which the target word was 					previously shown. In the Humphreys et al. condition the cue word 						UPPER or lower was centrally presented and 					indicated the location in which the target word previously appeared. Results 					{{demonstrated that}} the occurrence of semantic and associate-semantic priming 					effects under postcue task conditions varied for the two cue types. Experiment 2 					investigated if these results were attributable to a between subject 					manipulation of cue type. Using a fully repeated measures design priming effects 					were evident for top located targets in both the associate-semantic and semantic 					prime-target contexts. Experiment 3 used a between subjects design to rule out 					the possibility that <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effects</b> between cue and context conditions 					contributed to the postcue task priming effects. Priming was evident for top 					located targets in an associate-semantic and semantic context for the line cue. 					For the word cue there was priming for top located targets from an 					associate-semantic context and a reverse priming effect for top located targets 					from the semantic context. Possible explanations for the occurrence of priming 					effects under postcue task conditions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Zimbabwe’s {{poor are}} {{predominantly}} {{located in the}} semi-arid regions and rely on rainfed agriculture for their subsistence. Decline in productivity, scarcity of arable land, irrigation expansion limitations, erratic rainfall and frequent dry spells, among others cause food scarcity. The challenge faced by small-scale farmers is to enhance water productivity of rainfed agriculture by mitigating intra-seasonal dry spells (ISDS) through the adoption of new technologies such as rainwater harvesting (RWH). The paper analyses the agro-hydrological functions of RWH and assesses its impacts (at field scale) on the crop yield gap {{as well as the}} Transpirational Water Productivity (WPT). The survey in six districts of the semi-arid Zimbabwe suggests that three parameters (water source, primary use and storage capacity) can help differentiate storage-type-RWH systems from “conventional dams”. The Agricultural Production Simulator Model (APSIM) was used to simulate seven different treatments (Control, RWH, Manure, Manure + RWH, Inorganic Nitrogen and Inorganic Nitrogen + RWH) for 30 years on alfisol deep sand, assuming no fertiliser <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effect</b> from season to season. The combined use of inorganic fertiliser and RWH is the only treatment that closes the yield gap. Supplemental irrigation alone not only reduces the risks of complete crop failure (from 20 % down to 7 % on average) for all the treatments but also enhances WPT (from 1. 75 kg m− 3 up to 2. 3 kg m− 3 on average) by mitigating ISD...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{models of}} the {{financial}} theory support {{the proposition that the}} stock prices should be fundamentally a reflection of the discounted value of earnings. Accordingly the investors and analysts should base their expectations on the expected future cash flows that are logically correlated or have a <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effect</b> vis-ŕ-vis present stream of cash flows. This logically implies that the managers would have an incentive to manipulate investor’s expectation of future cash flows. The zeal to maximize the firm’s value based on market capitalization is expected to have a detrimental effect on the investment decisions leading to sub optimality. Given the imperfect information structure and market pressures, the Indian firms suffer from mispricing and as such the conventional robust theoretical models of agency conflicts cannot be refuted. This motivates us to examine the interrelation ship between the concerns for valuation and investment sensitivity. We use a sample statistics of selected listed firms that represent the CNX Nifty Index and test for the dependence of the investment behavior of the firm, on the sensitivity of the firms’ share prices to its current cash flow represented by surprise earings. We use the earnings response coefficient (ERC) framework proposed by Ball and Brown (1968) for 11 key industries in India. We find that the surpise in accounting earnings announcements is negatively associated with abnormal stock returns and the investment decisions taken by the firms are negatively sensitive to changes in investment opportunities...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of plant}} growth {{regulators}} (PGR) in nitrogen (N) fertilization of spring wheat and oats (CCC), fodder barley (etephon/mepiquat) and oilseed rape (etephone) in crop rotation was studied in 19931996 on loamy clay soil. <b>Carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effect</b> of the N fertilization rates (0180 kg ha- 1) was evaluated in 1997. N fertilization {{rate for the}} best grain/seed yield (120150 kg ha- 1) was not affected by PGRs. The seed and N yields of oilseed rape were improved most frequently by recommended use of PGR. The yields of oats were increased in 199596. Even though PGR effectively shortened the plant height of spring wheat, the grain yield increased only in 1995. N yield of wheat grains was not increased. Response of fodder barley to PGR was insignificant or even negative in 1995. The data suggest that PGRs may decrease some N leaching at high N rates by improving N uptake by grain/seeds, if the yield is improved. The carryover study showed that in soils with no N fertilization, {{as well as in}} soils of high N rates, N uptake was higher than in soils with moderate N fertilization (6090 kg ha- 1), independent of PGRs. According to soil mineral N contents, N leaching risk is significant (1535 kg ha- 1) only after dry and warm late seasons. After a favourable season of high yields, the N rates did not significantly affect soil mineral N contents. ...|$|E
40|$|Many organisms {{can alter}} their behavior, life history, and {{morphology}} {{in response to}} their environment. This ability is known as phenotypic plasticity. One of the major environmental cues that triggers a phenotypic plastic response in some organisms is the threat of predation. Predator-induced phenotypic plasticity is finely tuned and organisms can respond differently to different types of predators and responses to a predator can <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> across life stages. These <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effects</b> may represent trade-offs associated with responding to predators because an adaptive response in one life stage may not be adaptive in a later life stage. In addition, many organisms show phenotypic plasticity in response to competitors and competitor-induced responses are often opposite of predator-induced responses. Since responses to predators are finely tuned and competitors also affect phenotypic plasticity, {{it remains to be}} seen as to what extent competitor identity (intra- and interspecific), age, and relative abundance alter the plastic phenotypic response to predators. We sought to determine the extent to which anti-predator responses in an early life stage persist into a later life stage in a natural setting, how competitor age and identity affect the response to a predator, and how the relative strength of intra- and interspecific competition affect the response of two co-occurring prey species to a predator. We used artificial ponds and larval frogs and toads to address these effects. Southern toads altered their life history and morphology in response to predators but the particular response depended on predator identity. Morphological differences that developed in response to aquatic predators during their larval stage <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> into their terrestrial juvenile stage, but differences only persisted for approximately one month after metamorphosis. Competitors alone had little effect on morphology, but they did strongly affect survival and life history. Predators on the other hand had strong effects on morphology, but competitors altered the way that pinewoods treefrogs responded to the predators. In particular, older intraspecific competitors caused pinewoods treefrogs to develop the most extreme defenses to predators. We also found that the relative strength of intra- and interspecific competition depends on the identity of the species involved. Pinewoods treefrogs seem to be poorer competitors than Cope's gray treefrogs and southern leopard frogs, and both pinewoods treefrogs and leopard frogs survived and grew better when there were more pinewoods present than leopard frogs. Predator identity, competitor age, competitor identity, and the relative strength of intra- and interspecific competition all affected the plastic phenotypic response of frogs and toads to a predator. Responses to a predator in one life stage also <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> into later life stages. These results highlight the importance of adding back the complexity of natural systems into experiments to gain a better understanding of how organisms can persist with predators...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effects of different speech tasks (recitation of prose (PR), alliteration (AR) and hexameter (HR) verses) and a control task (mental arithmetic (MA) with voicing of the result) on endtidal CO 2 (ET-CO 2), cerebral hemodynamics; i. e. total hemoglobin (tHb) and tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2). tHb and StO 2 were measured with a frequency domain near infrared spectrophotometer (ISS Inc., USA) and ET-CO 2 with a gas analyzer (Nellcor N 1000). Measurements were performed in 24 adult volunteers (11 female, 13 male; age range 22 to 64 years) during task performance in a randomized order on 4 different days to avoid potential <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effects.</b> Statistical analysis was applied to test differences between baseline, 2 recitation and 5 recovery periods. The two brain hemispheres and 4 tasks were tested separately. Data analysis revealed that during the recitation tasks (PR, AR and HR) StO 2 decreased statistically significant (p < 0. 05) during PR and AR in the right prefrontal cortex (PFC) and during AR and HR in the left PFC. tHb showed a significant decrease during HR in the right PFC and during PR, AR and HR in the left PFC. During the MA task, StO 2 increased significantly. A significant decrease in ET-CO 2 was found during all 4 tasks with the smallest decrease during the MA task. In conclusion, we hypothesize that the observed changes in tHb and StO 2 are mainly caused by an altered breathing during the tasks that led a lowering of the CO 2 content in the blood provoked a cerebral CO 2 reaction, i. e. a vasoconstriction of blood vessels due to decreased CO 2 pressure and thereby decrease in cerebral blood volume. Therefore, breathing changes should be monitored during brain studies involving speech when using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to ensure a correct interpretation of changes in hemodynamics and oxygenation...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} fully {{understand}} factors that affect animals during distinct parts of their annual cycle, {{it is important to}} consider that processes acting in one season may <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> to influence an individual’s success in the following season. Measuring conditions over multiple seasons and life history stages allows <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> <b>effects</b> to be identified and places an individual's current condition into a broader context. Corticosterone levels measured in blood reflect hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity in birds in response to challenges that threaten homeostasis. Circulating corticosterone is integrated into growing feathers and can provide physiological information about birds during times when they are unavailable for blood sampling. Here, we used a commercially-available enzyme immunoassay kit to measure corticosterone in alcid feathers, demonstrated the benefits of acetonitrile/hexane purification of samples, and showed that blood and feather corticosterone are biologically-meaningful, albeit non-identical, measures. We used our enzyme-immunoassay and purification method in tandem with stable isotope analysis to measure corticosterone and stable isotopes in feathers and blood collected from rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata nesting on three widely-dispersed colonies during years with different oceanographic conditions. We found that individuals from different colonies could be distinguished by their δ 15 N and δ 13 C stable isotope values during, but not prior to the breeding season, and that corticosterone levels were consistent with this pattern. Furthermore, we found that rhinoceros auklets had significantly lower corticosterone levels in a year and on a colony assumed to have less favourable feeding conditions, which is opposite to results for other taxa. In a relative of the rhinoceros auklet, the Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica, we found that egg mass increased in relation to female corticosterone and δ 15 N values in feathers grown in the months prior to breeding, indicating that physiological state of females prior to the breeding season can influence egg mass. In contrast, we found that pre-breeding corticosterone and δ 15 N values of rhinoceros auklet females were not correlated with egg mass or egg protein levels (pilot study). Overall our results support our hypotheses that corticosterone levels vary with environmental conditions and that differences in corticosterone levels during pre-breeding correlate with egg size in the subsequent season (breeding). However, our results also indicate that interpreting these relationships requires careful consideration of ecological and physiological characteristics of the individual or taxa in question...|$|R
