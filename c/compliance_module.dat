40|$|Ecotourism in Malaysia {{has proven}} to be a very lucrative market and {{continues}} to grow at phenomenal rates. The ecotourism concept emphasises the maximisation of the ecological interest areas with minimum destruction of the local equilibrium. A systematic expert rating system is developed to maintain a certain level of standards based on different levels of categorisation to ensure the sustainability of these ecotourism sites. The initial study for this research included a literature review on the existing rating and ranking system used in the hospitality and tourism sector. The findings of the research are combined with the opinions among local residents, officers (ecotourism operators) and visitors to make the decision, and to be converted to rules to be used as the basis for the construction of an expert system. The expert system developed used 3 levels of cumulative rating: the filtration module, basic <b>compliance</b> <b>module</b> and the advance <b>compliance</b> <b>module.</b> In the filtration module, sites are rated according to the level of compliance to the ecotourism definition and the existing legislation covering the ecotourism industry in Malaysia. Basic <b>compliance</b> <b>module</b> rates sites according to the compliance of safety, health and environment for the ecotourism value, qualification of th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a robot periphery prototyped for the six-degrees-of-freedom robotic dental testing simulator, simulating the wear of materials on dental components, such as individual teeth, crowns, bridges, or {{a full set}} of teeth. The robot periphery consists of the artificial jaws and <b>compliance</b> <b>module.</b> The jaws have been reverse engineered and represent a human-like mandible and maxilla with artificial teeth. Each clinically fabricated tooth consists of a crown and glass ceramic roots which are connected using resin cement. Normal clinical occlusion of the artificial jaws assembly was emulated by a dental articulator based on ‘Andrew’s six keys to occlusion’. The radii of the von Spee curve, the Monson curve, and the Wilson curve were also measured as important jaw characteristic indicators to aid normal occlusion. A <b>compliance</b> <b>module</b> had to be built between the lower jaw and the robot platform to sustain the fluctuating forces that occur during normal chewing in the occlusal contact areas, where these high bite forces are major causes of dental component failure. A strain gauge force transducer has been integrated into the machined lower jaw, underneath the second molars, to measure axial biting forces applied to the posterior teeth. The experiments conducted have shown that the sensor is able to sense small changes in the compression force satisfactorily, when applied perpendicular to the occlusal surfaces of the teeth...|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007 - 2009 {{and the subsequent}} reaction of the G 20 have created a new global regulatory landscape. Within the EU, change of regulatory institutions is ongoing. The research objective {{of this study is}} to understand how institutional changes to the EU regulatory landscape may affect corresponding institutionalized operational practices within financial organizations and to understand the role of agency within this process. Our motivation is to provide insight into these changes from an operational management perspective, as well as to test Thelen and Mahoney?s (2010) modes of institutional change. Consequently, the study researched implementations of an Investment Management System with a rules-based <b>compliance</b> <b>module</b> within financial organizations. The research consulted compliance and risk managers, as well as systems experts. The study suggests that prescriptive regulations are likely to create isomorphic configurations of rules-based compliance systems, which consequently will enable the institutionalization of associated compliance practices. The study reveals the ability of some agents within financial organizations to control the impact of regulatory institutions, not directly, but through the systems and processes they adopt to meet requirements. Furthermore, the research highlights the boundaries and relationships between each mode of change as future avenues of research...|$|E
40|$|The {{market for}} {{contingent}} workers grows every year. Managing this workforce gets {{more and more}} challenging because of regulatory compliance, the difficulty of finding matching employees, and keeping track of expenses. FleXentral tries to be a platform that solves these issues. The goal of this project was to build a proof-of-concept of this concept, {{that can be used}} to show the potential to customers, but that will also be used as a basis for the final application. We created a set of requirements together with our client that such a system would require, and built the first version in a span of 10 weeks. This version includes a matching module that matches flexworkers to project-managers based on their competences, a negotiation module that simplifies the process of creating a contract and a reporting module where financial and compliance data can be inspected on an organizational-, project- and personal level. The final product we delivered during this project has basic versions of these systems implemented as a modern, responsive web-application. It is far from production ready, but it is demo-ready for potential customers, and of good quality to form a strong foundation for creating a production-ready platform. We recommend that for further development, the focus should be in four directions: the matching algorithm, the <b>compliance</b> <b>module,</b> user testing and non-functional requirements as maintainability and scalability. Each of these directions should be a cycle of continuous improvement. Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer ScienceSoftware EngineeringComputer Scienc...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{moderate}} permanent magnetic field (i. e., 0. 50 Tesla) on a structural epoxy has been investigated. The magnetic field induced-changes on the microstructure of the epoxy system where probed through wide-angle x-ray diffraction (WAXD) and texture analysis. Pole figures were generated for all the samples along the directions parallel and perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. This allowed, quantitatively, comparing the textures and fully understanding the mechanisms that result in a preferred orientation generation. The texture analysis revealed that under such moderate magnetic field and due to the diamagnetism of the epoxy system, the chains and the cross linking reorient biaxially in a plane that shares the magnetic field direction. The evolution of mechanical properties (modulus, hardness and toughness) under different thermo-mechanical environment was investigated using the instrumented nanoindentation. Improvements in both Young’s modulus and hardness by up to 6. 6 % were observed in the transverse direction of the magnetic field. However, evident by the measured elastic and plastic work under nanoindentation, {{it was observed that}} the magnetically annealed sample encountered slight embitterment. Furthermore, the current study reports enhancement on the mechanical properties of the epoxy when the nanoindentation tests are carried out under elevated temperatures (50 - 70 °C) below the glass transition temperature of the epoxy The time-dependent behavior of the epoxy was investigated under different thermal environments on light of the magnetic annealing- induced texture. The storage and loss moduli together with tan-delta as measures of the viscoelastic behavior of the polymer were measured using the continuous contact <b>compliance</b> <b>module</b> of the nanoindenter. The results of the current study showed that even under relatively low magnetic fields the mechanical properties, creep resistance and viscoelastic properties of the structural epoxy have been improved; tan-delta was measured to be 9. 8 % less for magnetically annealed compared to the neat epoxy sample.

40|$|The {{successful}} implementation of a Development Plan depends heavily {{on the ability of}} the implementing agency to understand the contents of the plan and the availability of adequate infrastructure for its execution. Lack of skilled staff, limited understanding of the development plan content and unavailability of executable procedures are among the issues and problems faced by the implementing agencies. The study has developed a Land Use Monitoring System (LUMS) with the capability of providing explicit and systematic explanation on the current status of the implementation of a Development Plan, using a GIS approach. The system consist of two modules namely the Achievement Analysis <b>Module</b> and the <b>Compliance</b> Analysis <b>Module.</b> Through the achievement module, the status of the development plan is monitored by comparing each land use class against the proposed land use in the same land parcel for a projected year.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to carry}} out {{offshore}} wind resource assessment, site suitability and technology selection for Bligh Waters in Fiji, and perform energy calculations for a 10 - 12 MW model offshore wind farm as well as carry out a simple economic analysis. The objectives were achieved by assessing the offshore wind resources employing atmospheric reanalysis data from the WindPRO online database performing the data correlation using the Measure Correlate Predict (MCP) module of WindPRO. The best correlated wind speed closest to the microsite was computed to be about 6. 5 m/s at a height of 10 m, with a dominant East-southeast (ESE) and South-southeast (SSE) wind directions. Furthermore, the wind turbine technology was selected to be Vestas V 80 - 2. 0 MW Offshore wind turbine and Siemens SWT- 2. 3 - 93 (2, 300 kW) wind turbine with wind turbine class IEC IA for the site using the analysis done by the WindPRO site <b>compliance</b> <b>module.</b> Moreover, energy calculations were performed for 10 MW and 11. 5 MW model offshore wind farms using the best correlated datasets close to the micro-site. The best model offshore wind farm {{was found to be}} the 11. 5 MW wind farm, which had an annual energy production of 40, 327. 5 MWh/year, a capacity factor of 40. 0 %, park efficiency of 99. 8 % and full load hours of 3507 hours/year. Each Siemens SWT- 2. 3 - 93 (2, 300 kW) wind turbine of the 11. 5 MW wind farm produces an average of 8, 065. 4 MWh annually. The wind farm has a simple payback time of approximately 8 years with an installation cost of USD $ 51, 750, 000 and AAR of USD $ 6, 452, 400. The cost of energy generation per kWh is computed to be USD $ 0. 12. Thus, comparing this to the cost of energy generation by other renewable and conventional sources in Fiji, it can be concluded that it is feasible and potentially competitive to invest into offshore wind farms to support the national electricity grid in Fiji...|$|E

The feasibility of CCA rests on the reduction of these limiting factors. Accordingly we present two approaches to mitigate these issues...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modular in-pipeline climbing robot {{with a novel}} compliant foldable OmniCrawler mechanism. The circular cross-section of the OmniCrawler module enables a holonomic motion to facilitate the alignment of the robot {{in the direction of}} bends. Additionally, the crawler mechanism provides a fair amount of traction, even on slippery surfaces. These advantages of crawler modules have been further supplemented by incorporating active <b>compliance</b> in the <b>module</b> itself which helps to negotiate sharp bends in small diameter pipes. The robot has a series of 3 such compliant foldable modules interconnected by the links via passive joints. For the desirable pipe diameter and curvature of the bends, the spring stiffness value for each passive joint is determined by formulating a constrained optimization problem using the quasi-static model of the robot. Moreover, a minimum friction coefficient value between the module-pipe surface which can be vertically climbed by the robot without slipping is estimated. The numerical simulation results have further been validated by experiments on real robot prototype...|$|R

A detailed description of the uppermost aquifer is included in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Part B post-closure care permit application for the F-Area Hazardous Waste Management Facility submitted to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) in December 1900. Data from 9 FSL wells are included in this report only to provide additional information for this area; the FSL wells are not part of Permit SCl- 890 - 008 - 989. Monitoring results are compared to the SCDHEC Groundwater Protection Standard (GWPS), which is specified in the approved F-Area Seepage Basins Part B permit (November 1992). Historically and currently, gross alpha, nitrate, nonvolatile beta, and tritium are among the primary constituents to exceed standards. Numerous other radionuclides and hazardous constituents also exceeded the GWPS in the groundwater at the FASB {{during the first half of}} 1995, notably aluminum, iodine- 129, pH, strontium- 90, and zinc.
