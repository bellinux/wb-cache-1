40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the chronic toxicity of methidathion, an organophosphate insecticide, in dogs. Groups of beagle dogs, four/sex/dose, were fed methidathion at <b>constant</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>concentrations</b> of 0, 0. 5, 2, 4, 40, or 140 ppm for 1 year. The equivalent daily dosages were approximately 0, 0. 02, 0. 07, 0. 15, 1. 4, and 4. 7 mg/kg. There were no deaths or adverse clinical signs associated with the treatment. Weekly body weights and weight gains were not affected. Mean daily food consumption was reduced in male dogs given the 140 -ppm diet. Major treatment-related effects were cholestasis, chronic in-flammation in the liver, and cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition. The liver effects were indicated by gross and microscopic patho-logic findings as well as moderate increases in serum bile acids and enzyme activities (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate ami-notransferase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase) in all dogs receiving ^ 40 ppm. RBC ChE was inhibited in males at 5 = 40 ppm and in females at 140 ppm. Brain ChE was inhibited in both sexes at 140 ppm; the magnitude of inhibition relative to control was slightly greater with the cerebellar fraction than with the cerebral fraction. Serum ChE was not affected at any dose level. In conclusion, liver was the target organ in beagle dogs given s* 40 ppm (equivalent to 1. 4 mg/kg/day) methidathion in diet for 1 year. The no-observable-effect level was 4 ppm (0. 15 mg/kg/day) for both liver cholestasis and ChE inhibition. © 199...|$|R
40|$|New Zealand White rabbits {{were used}} to {{investigate}} the influence of increasing <b>dietary</b> P <b>concentrations</b> on growth performance, mineral balance, kidney calcification and bone development. The minimum dietary P requirement of 0. 22 % (National Research Council) is usually exceeded in commercial natural-ingredient chows, leading to undesirable kidney calcifications. In order to study the optimal dietary P level, rabbits were fed semi-purified diets with four different P levels (0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, and 0. 8 %; w/w) at a <b>constant</b> <b>dietary</b> Ca <b>concentration</b> (0. 5 %) during an 8 -week period. Body weight and growth were not influenced by the dietary P level. During two periods (days 20 - 23 and 48 - 51), faeces and urine were collected quantitatively {{for the analysis of}} Ca, Mg and P and balances were calculated. Increased dietary P intake caused increased urinary and faecal P excretion and P apparent absorption and retention. Faecal Ca excretion increased with higher dietary P levels, whereas urinary Ca excretion reacted inversely. The apparent absorption of Ca became reduced at higher <b>dietary</b> P <b>concentrations,</b> but Ca retention was unchanged. The response of Mg was in a similar direction to that of the Ca balance. Kidney mineral content increased with higher dietary P levels, indicating the presence of calcified deposits. Nephrocalcinosis became more severe in kidney cortex and medulla at increasing dietary P levels, as was confirmed by histological analysis. Femur bone length was not differentially influenced by dietary P. Bone density (g/cm(3)) of the femur diaphysis became significantly lower at the 0. 8 % dietary P level as compared with the 0. 2 % P group only. The bone Mg content was significantly increased on the 0. 8 % P diet, both in the diaphysis and epiphysis. Plasma P concentration increased and plasma Ca decreased with higher dietary P levels, whereas plasma Mg levels were unaffected. The present study shows that the current recommended minimum dietary P level of 0. 2 % for rabbits, as advised by the National Research Council in 1977, leads to a normal growth and bone development, but also causes some degree of kidney calcifications at a dietary Ca level of 0. 5 %. As the dietary P level of 0. 1 % virtually prevented kidney calcification {{and at the same time}} did not give evidence for any deleterious effects on growth and bone development, this indicates that the current recommended dietary P level for rabbits should be regarded as a maximum advisable concentration, and that a lower P level may be more optimal...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} percentage of apparent magnesium (Mg) absorption in dry cows with {{a low level of}} dry matter intake is comparable to that in lactating cows with high feed intake, but fed the same diet in terms of composition. Lactating cows were fed rations with an ingredient and nutrient composition which was identical to the rations that were used in a previous study in dry cows. The trial had a 16 × 16 -day cross-over design and was preceded by a 10 -day run-in period. The six non-pregnant, lactating, multiparous cows (Friesian–Holstein × Holstein–Friesian cross) were fed rations with low and high Mg content, the levels being 3. 7 and 6. 3 g Mg/kg dry matter at a <b>constant</b> <b>dietary</b> potassium (K) <b>concentration</b> of 30. 7 g K/kg dry matter. Increasing the level of Mg intake from 68. 1 to 116. 3 g Mg per day resulted in absolute Mg absorptions of 9. 0 and 18. 5 g Mg per day (P = 0. 005). Mg absorption, expressed as a fraction of intake, for the low and high-Mg rations was 0. 131 and 0. 159 (P = 0. 183) these values being similar to those observed earlier in dry cows. Milk production was not significantly influenced by the level of Mg intake (P = 0. 075).

40|$|Marine {{resources}} are today limited, {{and due to}} this there is an increasing inclusion of non-marine lipids in the diet of farmed salmonids. An optimal diet for farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) should not only promote fast growth, but also keep the fish at good health, making it robust to face changes and stressors from the surrounding environment. There is, however, still knowledge lacking about the nutritional needs of Atlantic salmon. Lipid sources vary in their fatty acid (FA) composition, {{as well as in}} content of other lipid soluble compounds, such as sterols and environmental contaminants. The focus of this thesis has been to study the effect of FAs and lipid soluble compounds on Atlantic salmon lipid metabolism and metabolic health. Very long-chained n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC n- 3 PUFAs), typically found in the marine environment, have on several occasions shown to have lipid-lowering properties. The lower <b>dietary</b> and tissue <b>concentrations</b> of these FAs in Atlantic salmon due to the substitution of marine oils with terrestrial oils, may thus have effects on the lipid metabolism. This was studied by performing four dietary trials using feeds with low concentrations of marine oils (0 – 86 g marine oils kg- 1 feed), and thus also low <b>dietary</b> <b>concentrations</b> of VLC n- 3 PUFAs (1. 5 - 8. 5 % eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) of total FAs and 0. 5 – 6. 6 % of diet). Lower <b>dietary</b> <b>concentrations</b> of VLC n- 3 PUFAs tended to increase liver lipids in all the dietary trials. However, the observed changes in liver lipid content could not solely be explained by <b>dietary</b> <b>concentrations</b> of VLC n- 3 PUFAs. Thus, <b>dietary</b> <b>concentrations</b> of saturated fats or plant sterols, commonly known as phytosterols, are hypothesised to affect liver lipid stores. Phytosterols are well-known to lower the uptake and synthesis of cholesterol, and might therefore have caused a cholesterol deficiency in the fish fed the low-marine diets containing low cholesterol levels. The transcription factors affected by phytosterols in the tissues are also involved in processes of lipogenesis, and disturbances in sterol metabolism could therefore affect the lipid storage in the liver. The effects of SFAs could not be separated from the effects of phytosterols with the current experimental designs. Thus, low dietary EPA and DHA concentrations (< 2 % of diet) increased the risk of higher lipid depositions in the liver and changes in lipid metabolism. The magnitude of liver lipid levels were further elevated when low <b>dietary</b> <b>concentrations</b> of EPA and DHA were combined with high dietary phytosterols (1100 mg kg- 1) and low saturated fat (< 5 % of diet). The VLC n- 3 PUFAs are also potent inhibitors of inflammation, and thus help maintaining a balanced function of the inflammatory system. Decreasing the <b>concentrations</b> of <b>dietary</b> VLC n- 3 PUFAs and simultaneously increasing <b>dietary</b> <b>concentrations</b> of the pro-inflammatory n- 6 FAs, common in vegetable oils, might skew the balance of the inflammatory system leading to a chronic low-grade inflammation. Temperature-dependant changes in inflammatory status were seen in Atlantic salmon fed very low <b>dietary</b> <b>concentrations</b> of VLC n- 3 PUFAs (0. 5 % EPA + DHA of diet), indicating dietary EPA and DHA below the minimum requirement for the fish to maintain an optimal inflammatory status. However, no effects on the response to a bacterial infection in vitro or on adiposity were seen due to the low <b>dietary</b> <b>concentrations</b> of VLC n- 3 PUFAs or n- 3 /n- 6 ratios as low as 1 to 0. 3. Concomitant with changes in lipid composition, are the changes in environmental contaminants delivered via the diet when fish oil is replaced by vegetable oils. Many of these contaminants are highly lipid soluble, enabling them to bioaccumulate in the lipid portion of organisms. The same physical properties enable them to be embedded in biological membranes, where they can perturb the structure, and thus also the function, of the membranes. An increased fluidity of model membranes was observed when adding two different types of typical vegetable oil contaminants, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Some of the observed toxic effect of these compounds on fish could therefore be partially due to this membrane perturbing effect of the PAHs. The combined effect of non-optimal concentrations of various lipids and lipid soluble compounds might thus negatively affect the health of Atlantic salmon by affecting the liver lipid metabolism as well as inflammation and the physico-chemical properties of the lipid bilayer. </p...|$|R

Methods A total of 1, 800 21 -day-old Ross 308 growing broiler chickens were allotted to 1 of 6 dietary treatments with 6 replicated cages. Six diets were formulated to provide increasing Ca concentrations of 4. 0, 5. 0, 6. 0, 7. 0, 8. 0, or 9. 0 g/kg in diets. The concentrations of NPP in all diets were maintained at 3. 0 g/kg, and phytase was supplemented to all diets {{at the level of}} 1, 000 fytase units (FTU) /kg. At the end of the 14 -d feeding trial, birds were euthanized for tibia sampling, and litter samples were collected from 3 areas in the cage. The FPD incidence was measured based on a 6 -point scoring system. Results <b>Dietary</b> Ca <b>concentrations</b> had no effect on growth performance of growing broiler chickens. However, a tendency (linear, p = 0. 05) for decreased feed efficiency was observed as <b>dietary</b> Ca <b>concentrations</b> were increased. The concentrations of Ca and P in the tibia of broiler chickens increased (linear and quadratic, p< 0. 01) with increasing Ca concentrations in low NPP diets containing phytase.

Twenty-eight Swedish Red cows were used in a cyclic change-over experiment with 4 periods of 21 d and with treatments in 2 × 4 factorial arrangement (however, the control diet without supplementary protein was not fed in replicate). The diets were fed ad libitum as a total mixed ration containing 600 g/kg of grass silage and 400 g/kg of concentrates on a dry matter (DM) basis. The concentrate without supplementary protein consisted of crimped barley and premix (312 and 88 g/kg of DM), providing 130 g of dietary crude protein (CP) /kg of DM. The other 6 concentrates were formulated to provide 170, 210, or 250 g of CP/kg of DM by replacing crimped barley with incremental amounts of SBM (50, 100, or 150 g/kg of diet DM) or TCM (70, 140, or 210 g/kg of diet DM). Feed intake was not influenced by <b>dietary</b> CP <b>concentration,</b> but tended to be greater in cows fed TCM diets compared with SBM diets. Milk and milk protein yield increased linearly with <b>dietary</b> CP <b>concentration,</b> with greater responses in cows fed TCM diets compared with SBM diets. Apparent N efficiency (milk N/N intake) decreased linearly with increasing <b>dietary</b> CP <b>concentration</b> and was lower for cows fed SBM diets than cows fed TCM diets.

The study was conducted as a 3 × 4 factorial arrangement of treatments with 3 concentrations of phytic acid (10. 4, 11. 8, and 13. 6 g/kg; equivalent to 2. 8, 3. 3, and 3. 8 g of phytate P/kg) and phytase (0, 500, 750, and 1, 000 FTU/kg). One unit of phytase (FTU) {{is defined as the}} quantity of enzyme that releases 1 mol of inorganic phosphorus/min from 0. 00015 mol/L of sodium phytate at pH 5. 5 at 37 °C. The <b>dietary</b> phytic acid <b>concentrations</b> were manipulated by the inclusion of rice bran. Increasing <b>dietary</b> <b>concentrations</b> of phytic acid resulted in reduc-tions (P < 0. 01) in AME. Phytase additions tended to increase AME (P = 0. 07), regardless of <b>dietary</b> phytate <b>concentrations.</b> Apparent ileal digestibility coefficients of protein and most amino acids were influenced by phytate (P < 0. 05 to 0. 001) and phytase (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction: The {{presence}} of melatonin in wine {{contributes to the}} cardioprotective effect of regular and moderate consumption of wine against lethal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Recently, the {{presence of}} melatonin isomers has been identified in red wine, {{but whether or not}} these isomers confer any physiological properties is unknown. Aim: The aim of our study was to establish a cell culture model of simulated ischemia to study and compare the possible cytoprotective effects of dietary melatonin and a melatonin isomer against an ischemic insult and to explore the possible role of melatonin receptors in this effect. Methods: H 9 C 2 cardiac fibroblast cells were subjected to simulated ischemia by exposure to 1 mM H₂O₂ following a 30 min pre-treatment with 75 ng/L (<b>dietary</b> <b>concentration),</b> 1 μM (pharmacological concentration, 0. 232 mg/L) melatonin or/and 75 mg/L (<b>dietary</b> <b>concentration)</b> melatonin isomer. To determine the role of melatonin receptors, cells were pre-treated with the melatonin receptor inhibitor, luzindole (10 μM) for 1 h prior to H₂O₂ treatment. At the end of the simulated ischemic insult, cell viability was assessed using trypan blue staining. Mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized H 9 C 2 cells was measured using the Oroboros Instrument, at two different time points: {{at the end of a}} 30 min pre-treatment with either 75 ng/L melatonin or 75 mg/L melatonin isomer, or the afore mentioned pre-treatments prior to a 15 min treatment of 1 mM H₂O₂. Results: A simulated ischemic insult with 1 mM H₂O₂ reduced cell viability from 92. 9 ± 1. 5 % to 28. 4 ± 1. 4 % (p< 0. 001 vs control). Pre-treatment with the <b>dietary</b> <b>concentrations</b> of melatonin or the melatonin isomer improved the cell viability to a similar extent as a pre-treatment with the pharmacological concentration of melatonin (74. 4 ± 3. 1 %, 73. 9 ± 2. 7 % and 69. 0 ± 1. 2 %, p< 0. 001 vs H₂O₂ and p< 0. 01 vs H₂O₂ respectively). A combined pre-treatment of melatonin and the melatonin isomer did not add further cytoprotective benefit. Addition of luzindole fully abolished the cytoprotective effect of dietary melatonin (29. 7 ± 2. 4 %, p< 0. 001 vs H₂O₂ + Mel), but only partially abolished the cytoprotective effect of the melatonin isomer (41. 4 ± 3. 6 %). Both <b>dietary</b> <b>concentrations</b> of melatonin and the melatonin isomer did not affect mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized H 9 C 2 cells. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that both dietary melatonin and the melatonin isomer confer cytoprotection against a simulated ischemic insult, an effect which is mediated, at least in part, via the activation of melatonin receptors. Both melatonin and melatonin isomers present the advantage to be potentially safe and inexpensive therapies against ischemic heart disease...|$|R

40|$|Pigs were reared via two {{management}} {{schemes to}} create a moderate and high level of antigen exposure in the pigs. In each antigen exposure group, pigs were self-fed one of five <b>dietary</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{of a group of}} five B vitamins (niacin, pantothenic acid, riboflavin, B 12, and folacin) from 22 to 61 pounds body weight. Bioavailable concentrations of the vitamins equivalent to 70, 170, 270, 370, and 470 % of the current estimated need (NRC, 1988) for 11 to 22 pound pigs were provided. Pigs experiencing a moderate versus high level of antigen exposure consumed more feed (+. 54 lb/day) and gained more body weight (. 32 lb/day) but required similar amounts of feed per unit of gain (-. 03). Dietary B vitamin additions at concentrations above current estimated requirements (NRC, 1988) resulted in up to 21 and 19 % faster body growth rates and 10 and 6 % less feed required per unit of gain in pigs experiencing a moderate and high level of antigen exposure, respectively. Based on these data, <b>dietary</b> <b>concentrations</b> of {{one or more of the}} test B vitamin equivalent to 370 % of the current estimated needs (NRC, 1988) are required to optimize rate and efficiency of growth in 20 to 60 pound pigs experiencing a moderate or high level of antigen exposure...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to compare the}} effects of changing energy intake, either by restricting feed intake or by altering <b>dietary</b> energy <b>concentration,</b> on the growth performance of pigs. The relative abilities of the DE, ME and NE systems to predict pig growth performance were also evaluated. A total of 72 barrows, having initial body-weights of 30 ± 2 kg, {{were randomly assigned to}} one of nine dietary treatments. These treatments were organized in a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement consisting of three <b>dietary</b> energy <b>concentrations</b> (2. 18, 2. 29 and 2. 40 Mcal NE/kg) and three levels of feed allowance (80, 90 and 100 % of ad libitum). Actual feed allowances of 79, 91 and 100 % of ad libitum were achieved. No interactive effects of feeding level and <b>dietary</b> energy <b>concentration</b> were observed (P > 0. 10). Increases in feed allowance from 79 to 91 to 100 % of ad libitum resulted in increases in daily intakes of feed (P 0. 10) basis. The efficiency with which dietary energy was used for weight gain was unaffected by feeding level (P > 0. 10). Increases in <b>dietary</b> energy <b>concentration</b> were accompanied by decreases in daily feed intakes (P = 0. 0016); however, <b>dietary</b> energy <b>concentration</b> did not affect daily energy intakes (P > 0. 10). Neither average daily gains nor feed conversion efficiencies were affected by changes in <b>dietary</b> energy <b>concentration</b> (P > 0. 10). Additionally, there were no differences among energy concentration treatments in terms of the amount of dietary energy available for body-weight gain (P > 0. 10) or the efficiency with which it was used (P > 0. 10). No differences were observed between the DE, ME and NE systems in terms of their abilities to predict the growth performance of pigs. The present study demonstrates that the energy intake of pigs can be effectively manipulated via adjustments in feeding level and that changes in dietary energy density, over the range studied here, are unable to affect changes in energy intake. This finding indicates that extreme caution should be used when extrapolating data obtained from studies in which feed allowance was manipulated to scenarios (e. g. commercial practice) in which energy density is to be altered, and vice versa...|$|R
