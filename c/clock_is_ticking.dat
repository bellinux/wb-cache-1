500|$|The {{success of}} the game spawned a franchise, with 16 sequels or {{spin-offs}} released to date. Due to its complex physics engine and abundance of possible shortcuts, Super Monkey Ball has been popular with professional speedrunners. A 2006 {{study conducted by the}} Beth Israel Medical Center found that surgeons who played the game for 20 minutes prior to performing a surgical drill finished slightly faster and made fewer mistakes. Super Monkey Ball inspired Neverball, a free game for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, Dreamcast, and iOS. In 2006, Nintendo Power ranked it the 38th best game available on Nintendo platforms, commenting [...] "who knew that such cute characters with cinnamon roll ears could be the source of so much tension (when the <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> <b>ticking)</b> and so much relief (when they finally break the ribbon)?" [...] In 2009, Edge ranked the game #39 on its list of [...] "The 100 Best Games To Play Today", stating [...] "Seeing its sturdy physics model being used to perform incredible acrobatic feats shows just how finely honed it is." [...] Writing in 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, Christian Donlan described Super Monkey Ball as [...] "one of Sega's grade-A triumphs." ...|$|E
2500|$|... (6) Time {{trouble is}} another {{consideration}} noted by various authors, including Webb himself. This has two aspects; the more obvious is exploiting the opponent's time pressure to perpetrate a swindle. Ali Mortazavi observes that [...] "when the <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> <b>ticking</b> {{and time is}} pressing, a player's intuition {{is most likely to}} let him down, and this is where the swindler will get his opportunity." [...] He writes, [...] "It is of the utmost importance that the swindler conducts himself in the appropriate fashion when his opponent is in time trouble." [...] This includes calmly reflecting rather than rushing one's moves. GM Pal Benko notes that it is unpleasant for the player in time trouble to have to wait at the board, without daring even to get up to get a drink of water; this also makes the player in time trouble impatient, interferes with his concentration, and may cause him to mix up his planned responses. Mortazavi also advocates that, in general, one should avoid playing the most obvious moves (one-move traps, obvious pawn breaks, checks, etc.), since the player in time trouble will likely have analyzed and have responses ready for them.|$|E

40|$|The {{events in}} Egypt in November 2011, and in {{preceding}} months, are stark reminders that the Middle East is changing in ways which {{a decade ago}} were rarely contemplated, either in the countries concerned or beyond them.

In time, they will cool and solidify into more predictable and hopefully more productive forms—but how long that may take is far from certain. The core argument I presented at Durham University in November 2010 was that the coming decade would witness a leadership transition in Egypt whose impact — for better or worse — would be felt across the region. The demographic <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> <b>ticking.</b> The political, economic, and social outlook was uncertain. And political, economic, social and strategic issues were inter-related.

60|$|My father's {{appointment}} with Lord Nelson {{was an early}} one, {{and he was the}} more anxious to be punctual as he knew how much the Admiral's movements must be affected by the news which we had heard the night before. I had hardly breakfasted then, and my uncle had not rung for his chocolate, when he called for me at Jermyn Street. A walk of a few hundred yards brought us to the high building of discoloured brick in Piccadilly, which served the Hamiltons as a town house, and which Nelson used as his head-quarters when business or pleasure called him from Merton. A footman answered our knock, and we were ushered into a large drawing-room with sombre furniture and melancholy curtains. My father sent in his name, and there we sat, looking at the white Italian statuettes in the corners, and the picture of Vesuvius and the Bay of Naples which hung over the harpsichord. I can remember that a black <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> <b>ticking</b> loudly upon the mantelpiece, and that every now and then, amid the rumble of the hackney coaches, we could hear boisterous laughter from some inner chamber.|$|R

[...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> <b>ticking.</b> Write the fucking script! But all I {{had to do was}} watch TV.

[...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|R
