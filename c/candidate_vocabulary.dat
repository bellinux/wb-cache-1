40|$|The chief {{complaint}} (CC) is {{the data}} element that documents the patient’s reason for visiting {{the emergency department}} (ED). The need for a CC vocabulary has been acknowledged at national meetings and in multiple publications, but to our knowledge no groups have specifically focused on the requirements and development plans for a CC vocabulary. The national consensus meeting ‘‘Towards Vocabulary Control for Chief Complaint’’ was convened to identify the potential uses for ED CC and to develop the framework for CC vocabulary control. The 10 -point consensus recommendations for action were 1) begin to develop a controlled vocabulary for CC, 2) obtain funding, 3) establish an infrastructure, 4) work with standards organizations, 5) address CC vocabulary characteristics for all user communities, 6) create a collection of CC for research, 7) identify the best <b>candidate</b> <b>vocabulary</b> for ED CCs, 8) conduct vocabulary validation studies, 9) establish beta test sites, and 10) plan publicity and marketing for the vocabulary...|$|E
40|$|Speech {{directed}} at infants and pets has properties that {{distinguish it from}} speech among adults [6]. Some of those properties are potentially useful for language learning. By careful design of form and behavior, robots can hope to evoke a similar speech register {{and take advantage of}} these properties. We report some preliminary data to support this claim, based on experiments carried out with the infant-like robot Kismet [4]. We then show how we can build a language model around an initial vocabulary, perhaps acquired from “cooperative ” speech, and bootstrap from it to identify further <b>candidate</b> <b>vocabulary</b> items drawn from arbitrary speech in an unsupervised manner. We show how to cast this process in a form that can be largely implemented using a conventional speech recognition system [8], even though such systems are designed with very different applications in mind. This is advantageous since, after decades of research, such systems are expert at making acoustic judgments in a probabilistically sound way from acoustic, phonological, and language models...|$|E
40|$|Estimating the {{parameters}} of sparse multinomial distributions {{is an important component}} of many statistical learning tasks. Recent approaches have used uncertainty over the vocabulary of symbols in a multinomial distribution as a means of accounting for sparsity. We present a Bayesian approach that allows weak prior knowledge, {{in the form of a}} small set of approximate <b>candidate</b> <b>vocabularies,</b> to be used to dramatically improve the resulting estimates. We demonstrate these improvements in applications to text compres-sion and estimating distributions over words in newsgroup data. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} recognizing a vocabulary–a collection of words (sequences) over a finite alphabet–from a potential subsequence {{of one of its}} words. We assume the given subsequence is received through a deletion channel as a result of transmission of a random word from one of the two generic underlying vocabularies. An exact maximum a posterior (MAP) solution for this problem counts the number of ways a given subsequence can be derived from particular subsets of <b>candidate</b> <b>vocabularies,</b> requiring exponential time or space. We present a polynomial approximation algorithm for this problem. The algorithm makes no prior assumption about the rules and patterns governing the structure of vocabularies. Instead, through off-line processing of vocabularies, it extracts data regarding regularity patterns in the subsequences of each vocabulary. In the recognition phase, the algorithm just uses this data, called subsequence-histogram, to decide in favor of one of the vocabularies. We provide examples to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm and show that it can achieve the same performance as MAP in some situations. Potential applications include bioinformatics, storage systems, and search engines. Index terms–Classification, histogram, recognition, search, storage, and subsequence. I...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{construct}} and standardize an Indigenous Intelligence Test (IIT) to measure general intelligence ‘g’ and a screening tool for youth intending to apply in Armed Forces, Public Service Commission and similar organizations where English carries a status of official language. The items of IIT were developed with the help of material obtained from own culture and were constructed in simple English language. The IIT comprises of six sub-scales: Vocabulary, Arithmetic, Analogy, Information, Comprehension, and Similarity. The test was planned to measure various aspects of intelligence verbal ability, to understand concepts, general reasoning factor, element of discovery, acquired knowledge, social intelligence, eduction of relations and correlates. The usefulness of the items was judged through item analysis by administering the test to a sample of 200 subjects with minimum Intermediate qualification. Items were evaluated by considering two main aspects; discrimination power and difficulty level. Items with discriminatory power less than. 30 and level of difficulty below. 30 and above. 70 were discarded. The final draft of the test comprised of 71 items Vocabulary and Arithmetic sub-scales consists of 12 items each, Analogy 14, Information 11, Comprehension 12 and Similarity 10. In the main study the test was administered to 1669 students both male and female, belonging to various Government Colleges & universities of four provinces of the country including AJK and FATA. Candidates both from urban and rural areas were included in the study. Two methods were used to establish reliability of the test i. e., KR 20 and Split-half methods. The estimated indices of reliability were,. 79 and. 69 respectively. To determine validity of indigenous intelligence test different validity criteria were used including urban/rural differences, province wise differences, correlation of the total test and sub-scales (construct validity) and marks in last qualified examination to determine concurrent validity Significant differences in the mean scores of the male and female <b>candidates</b> on <b>vocabulary,</b> arithmetic, analogy and information were found whereas non significant difference was observed on comprehension and similarity subscales. Significant mean differences on vocabulary, arithmetic, analogy and information and non significant difference on comprehension and similarity were also found. Inter-correlation among the subscales and IIT were calculated to determine construct validity of the test. The concurrent validity was determined by correlating scores on IIT with the college marks obtained by each student in the last annual examination. Both indices established the evidence of high validity of the test. Significant differences in urban/rural mean scores on vocabulary, analogy, information, comprehension subscales and IIT were observed. Significant differences were also observed in Province wise mean scores on vocabulary, arithmetic, analogy, information and comprehension subscales. Whereas, non significant mean scores were found on similarity subscale. Income group wise comparison revealed that higher the income groups better the performance. Percentile norms were developed for IIT and subscales while administering the test on a sample of 1669 subjects representative of Pakistani youth. In addition, province wise norms were also developed to gauge true performance of candidates hailing from different province...|$|R
40|$|Language {{teaching}} methods based on traditional grammar rules {{have left their}} places to methods, techniques and strategies that are different and where students are active in learning. Researchers grouped learning in four main categories as Behaviorist Learning Approach, Cognitive Learning Approach, Affective Learning Approach and Brain Based Learning Approach. According to Cognitive Approach, which deals with language learning, a student passes through a cognitive process throughout his languagelearning experience. It is essential to reach the four basic skill (Listening, Speaking, Reading, Writing) of the target language. This approach is effective in emerging learningstrategies, and allows learners to takethe responsibility of their own learning, and participate learning actively. Thus, learners, now, reach their targets easily by adding knowledge to what they already know using direct and indirect learning strategies that helps to code, store and restore information and expand their learning capacities by using learning ways more consciously. According to the studies held in the field, a number of learning strategies has been improved taking four basic language skills into consideration, and these strategies are separated into two groups as Indirect Leaning Strategies and Direct Learning Strategies. It is vital for a language learner who has the knowledge of direct and indirect learning strategies to learn these strategies and use them in his on learning. Herethe learning responsibility lies upon the learner himself. Another problem that learners have to face while learning a second language is vocabulary learning. The larger the vocabulary is {{the easier it is}} to communicate. To speak a language fluently one should know how to produce the sounds in the language properly. However, knowing how to produce sounds alone is not enough to speak the language. What should be done to learn vocabulary, what kind of a why should be followed? Naturally, just learning a vocabulary item is not enough to have an effective communication. The aim in learning a word should be to remember and use it when needed because learning is not only taking the knowledge as it is given, but also interpreting, shaping, and producing new meanings. While learning a Word, it is necessary to learn the meaning, use and grammar of the Word as well. However, Schmitt emphasized that using all the learning strategies while learning vocabulary in a foreign language {{is a waste of time}} and strength, and improved (VLS) Vocabulary Learning Strategies to ease vocabulary learning in five headings; Determination Strategies, Social Strategies, Memory Strategies, Cognitive Strategies and Metacognitive Strategies. The aim of this study is to determine the vocabulary learning strategies that 178 teacher candidates studying at Anadolu university Education Faculty German Language and Education Department at 1., 2., 3., and 4., grades during 2011 - 2012 academic year use while learning German as a second language, and to suggest learning strategies that direct students along with four basic learning skills to help students learn vocabulary more easily. As the data collection tool, a questionnaire based on Schmitt’s Vocabulary Learning Strategies; Determination Strategies, Social Strategies, Memory Strategies, Cognitive Strategies and Metacognitive Strategies was prepared, given to teacher candidates who learn German as a Second Language, and results were analyzed and evaluated. When the data were analyzed and the excess of female teacher candidates was taken into consideration, it is seen that female learners used memory and cognitive strategies more than male students. The results of the study showed that German Language teacher <b>candidates</b> followed some <b>vocabulary</b> learning strategies in the choice, code, store them into their long-term memory, and recall when needed, and became more successful in learning vocabulary items than the students who do not know and use strategies. All the teacher <b>candidates</b> stated that <b>vocabulary</b> learning in language learning is very important. Moreover, the data related to the words that students stated they learn more in some courses provided in Education Faculty German Language and Education Department in 2011 - 2012 academic-year spring term, and the orders students do related to the strategies they use in vocabulary learning were provided in tables. When the grades of the students were taken into consideration, it was revealed that 1. And 2. Grade students were found to use only memory strategies, and 4. And 5. Grade students were found to use memory strategies by attaching cognitive strategies to it. It is determined that teacher candidates chose to learn vocabulary by written forms and pronunciation, relating words with synonyms and antonyms, and using the newly learned words in context. When all these data were evaluated it is revealed that memory strategies have a bigger role in vocabulary learning compared with other strategies, and help memorize and recall the newly learned vocabulary more easily. Moreover, memory strategiesalso consist of strategies that learners could associate and integrate what they learned with what they already know in their mother tongue. Considering that German language is thought and learned as a second language, teacher candidates learning this language stated that they use the methods and techniques used in learning English language which the students learn as first foreign language and that belongs to the same language family as the German language, they use the strategies used when they learn English. Taking all these evaluations into consideration, ways to affect German teacher candidates positively by directing them to strategies that might be helpful for them should be found. As they are the learners of a new foreign language, they should be taught the ways of effective word usage, scientific research methods that they could use, how to prepare a word book, which strategies could be helpful in learning vocabulary. Moreover, they should also be informed about learning strategies where theycould learn vocabulary more easily along with the four main language skills that support the improvement of language skills in language books, and they should be allowed to participate in activities and applications to improve their field knowledge. Entertaining settings where students could share the information they gathered through games, songs, puzzles, etc. should be provided. Moreover, examples and similarities, visual support, and application fields aiming to improve understanding retentionshould be provided, and the scope of the material they use should be extended. According to these results, it could be claimed that teacher candidates should be directed to strategies that could be beneficial for them in learning vocabulary...|$|R
