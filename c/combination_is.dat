Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.|$|E

5|$|After {{the islands}} were {{transferred}} to Scotland, thousands of Scots families emigrated to Shetland in the 16th and 17th centuries but studies of the genetic makeup of the islands' population indicate that Shetlanders are just under half Scandinavian in origin. A sizeable component of Scandinavian patrilineal ancestry {{has been reported in}} Orkney (55%) and Shetland (68%). This <b>combination</b> <b>is</b> reflected in many aspects of local life. For example, almost every place name in use {{can be traced back to}} the Vikings. The Norn language was a form of Old Norse, which continued to be spoken until the 18th century when it was replaced by an insular dialect of Scots known as Shetlandic, which is in turn being replaced by Scottish English. Although Norn was spoken for hundreds of years it is now extinct and few written sources remain. Shetlandic is used both in local radio and dialect writing, and kept alive by the Shetland Folk Society.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Plantae {{belongs to}} Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is {{separately}} classified. The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); Species. The scientific {{name of a}} plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism. For example, the tiger lily is Lilium columbianum. Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the specific epithet. The <b>combination</b> <b>is</b> {{the name of the}} species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).|$|E

5|$|Simple or {{uncomplicated}} malaria may {{be treated}} with oral medications. The most effective treatment for P.falciparum infection {{is the use of}} artemisinins in combination with other antimalarials (known as artemisinin-combination therapy, or ACT), which decreases resistance to any single drug component. These additional antimalarials include: amodiaquine, lumefantrine, mefloquine or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Another recommended <b>combination</b> <b>is</b> dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine. ACT is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria. To treat malaria during pregnancy, the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus clindamycin early in the pregnancy (1st trimester), and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters). In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia. Infection with P.vivax, P.ovale or P.malariae usually do not require hospitalization. Treatment of P.vivax requires both treatment of blood stages (with chloroquine or ACT) and clearance of liver forms with primaquine. Treatment with tafenoquine prevents relapses after confirmed P. vivax malaria.|$|E
5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane begins {{immediately after}} the onset of exposure. The kidney and liver toxicity observed after anesthetic doses is attributable {{to one or more}} metabolites produced by O-demethylation of methoxyflurane. Significant products of this catabolic process include methoxyfluoroacetic acid (MFAA), dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), and inorganic fluoride. Methoxyflurane nephrotoxicity is dose dependent and irreversible, resulting from O-demethylation of methoxyflurane to fluoride and DCAA. This effect is so predictable and reproducible that methoxyflurane now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride-related nephrotoxicity, one with which newer drugs are compared. It is not entirely clear whether the fluoride itself is toxic—it may simply be a surrogate measure for some other toxic metabolite. The concurrent formation of inorganic fluoride and DCAA is unique to methoxyflurane biotransformation compared with other volatile anesthetics, and this <b>combination</b> <b>is</b> more toxic than fluoride alone. This may explain why fluoride formation from methoxyflurane is associated with nephrotoxicity, while fluoride formation from other volatile anesthetics (such as enflurane and sevoflurane) is not. Furthermore, the concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.|$|E
5|$|The {{chromosomal}} region that encodes an antibody {{is large and}} contains several distinct gene loci for each domain of the antibody—the chromosome region containing heavy chain genes (IGH@) is found on chromosome 14, and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes (IGL@ and IGK@) are found on chromosomes 22 and 2 in humans. One of these domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells. Differences, between the variable domains, are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions. The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these genes {{with an array of}} genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies {{with a high degree of}} variability. This <b>combination</b> <b>is</b> called V(D)J recombination discussed below.|$|E

5|$|The {{lower jaw}} is rather robust. It is also {{straight}} in top view, without much expansion at the jaw tip, suggesting the lower jaws as a pair, the mandibula, were narrow. Several traits in 2008 identified as autapomorphies, later transpired {{to have been}} the result of damage. However, a unique combination of traits is present in the wide longitudinal groove on the outer side (shared with Torvosaurus), the small third dentary tooth and a vascular channel, below the row of interdental plates, that only is closed from the fifth tooth position onwards. The number of dentary teeth was probably thirteen or fourteen, though the preserved damaged specimens show at most eleven tooth sockets. The interdental plates have smooth inner sides, whereas those of the maxilla are vertically grooved; the same <b>combination</b> <b>is</b> shown by Piatnitzkysaurus. The surangular has no bony shelf, or even ridge, on its outer side. There is laterally an oval opening present in front of the jaw joint, a foramen surangulare posterior, but a second foramen surangulare anterior to the front of it is lacking.|$|E
5|$|The player, who {{collected}} all the four Kings, {{is entitled to}} declare tute (all), which automatically ends the round with a collector's victory. Having both King and Knight of the trump suit, one can declare las cuarenta (forty), scoring additional 40-round points. The combination of King and Knight of any other suit can be declared as veinte (twenty); it adds 20 round points to the player's score. If possible, a player can declare several combination. In such cases the declarations with the higher round point value must be made first. For example, after declaring veinte the player loses right to declare las cuarenta, though declaring another veinte is still allowed. In Two-player games the declaration order rule only applies to declarations between each trick is played, so the player can declare las cuarenta after veinte if the <b>combination</b> <b>is</b> collected by picking the previously missing card from the stock.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first named by Moses Ashley Curtis as Boletus ananas in 1848, based on {{specimens}} he found near the Santee River, in South Carolina. In 1909, William Murrill described the new genus Boletellus and made Boletellus ananas the type species. According to Murrill, the taxon Boletus isabellinus, described by Charles Horton Peck in 1897 from specimens collected in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, is a synonym of B.ananas; Peck described this species from undeveloped specimens. Wally Snell later doubted Murrill's conclusion in a 1933 publication; {{he considered the}} differences in the spore structure too great to consider the species conspecific with B.ananas, although he admitted it was impossible to come to any definitive conclusions until mature fruit bodies and spore prints were available for study. Rolf Singer and colleagues (1992) suggested the name Boletellus coccineus for Boletellus ananas. Singer created this name, however, in the mistaken belief that the earliest available name for the taxon was Boletus coccineus, proposed by Elias Magnus Fries in 1838. However, Fries’s name is an illegitimate later homonym (compare with Boletus coccineus, named by Bulliard in 1791), and Singer’s <b>combination</b> <b>is</b> actually based on Strobilomyces coccineus, named by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1888. The earliest available name for the species is therefore Boletus ananas M.A. Curtis 1848, the basionym of Boletellus ananas.|$|E
