5000|$|Thomas Frederick Colby FRS FRSE FGS FRGS (1 September 1784 - 9 October 1852), was a British major-general and {{director}} of the Ordnance Survey (OS). A Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and Royal Society, Colby was one of the leading geographers of his time.An officer in the Royal Engineers, Colby overcame the loss of one hand in a shooting accident to begin in 1802 a lifelong connection with the Ordnance Survey. His most important work was the Survey of Ireland. He began planning this enormous enterprise in 1824 and directed it until 1846, in which year the final maps made by the survey were almost ready for issue. He was the inventor of the [...] "Colby Bar" [...] (a <b>compensation</b> <b>bar),</b> an apparatus used in base-measurements.|$|E

40|$|Horne v. Department of Agriculture exposes a {{fundamental}} confusion {{right at the}} nerve of the Supreme Court’s contemporary takings jurisprudence. Since its 1985 decision in Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton, the Supreme Court has insisted that a property owner who wants to raise a takings claim in federal court must first exhaust any post-deprivation remedies made available by state or federal law. The theory {{has been that the}} Fifth Amendment merely requires the government to compensate a property owner for a property invasion, and therefore no taking has occurred unless and until the property owner attempts to obtain compensation and is denied. Any takings claim before the denial of compensation is, in the words of Williamson County, not “ripe. ” But this is a mistake - and quite {{a fundamental}} one. In fact, the availability of compensation {{has nothing to do with}} ripeness. It has to do with remedies. Before Williamson County, courts had held for two centuries that if the government took private property but provided no mechanism for compensating the owner, the owner could obtain equitable relief if the taking was not complete, or damages if it were. No court had ever held that the availability of <b>compensation</b> <b>barred</b> a claim as unripe. This earlier rule reflected an understanding of the Takings Clause markedly different from the one the Court embraced in Williamson County - as a governmental disability, a structural limit on governmental power, rather than as a promise to pay. The Court’s confusion in Williamson County stemmed in large measure from abandoning this older understanding in favor of an interpretation of the Takings Clause as a standing offer to pay. The Horne case suggests how the Court might recover a better conception of the Clause and put its takings jurisprudence back on track...|$|R

[...] Other than his design for the 1867 Assay Commission medal, and his similar, wreathed reverses for the commission medals in 1860, 1861, and 1868, the Ingraham work was Longacre's only medal made for the government.|$|R

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{studied the}} magnetoresistance of a superconducting Al microbridge fabricated {{on top of}} a ferromagnetic BaFe 12 O 19 single crystal. Due to the presence of a one-dimensional domain structure in the ferromagnetic substrate, the superconducting critical temperature reaches its maximal value at the <b>compensation</b> field, vertical <b>bar</b> H vertical bar similar or equal to B- 0, when superconductivity nucleates above magnetic domains of opposite polarity with respect to the applied magnetic field H (so-called reverse-domain superconductivity, B- 0 being the amplitude of the z-component of the nonuniform magnetic field). Such localized superconductivity makes it possible to transfer superconducting currents without dissipation only along the magnetic domains, leading to a pronounced anisotropy of the resistance of this system at low temperatures.

2500|$|The Gemara {{taught that}} the words [...] "eye for eye" [...] in [...] meant pecuniary <b>compensation.</b> Simeon <b>bar</b> Yochai asked those who would take the words {{literally}} how they would enforce equal justice where a blind man put out the eye of another man, or an amputee cut off the hand of another, or where a lame person broke the leg of another. The school of Rabbi Ishmael cited the words [...] "so shall it be given to him" [...] in [...] and deduced that the word [...] "give" [...] could apply only to pecuniary compensation. The school of Rabbi Hiyya cited the words [...] "hand for hand" [...] in [...] to mean that an article was given from hand to hand, namely money. Abaye reported that a sage {{of the school of}} Hezekiah taught that [...] said [...] "eye for eye" [...] and [...] "life for life," [...] but not [...] "life and eye for eye," [...] and it could sometimes happen that eye and life would be taken for an eye, as when the offender died while being blinded. Rav Papa said in the name of Rava that [...] referred explicitly to healing, and the verse would not make sense if one assumed that retaliation was meant. And Rav Ashi taught that the principle of pecuniary compensation could be derived from the analogous use of the term [...] "for" [...] in [...] in the expression [...] "eye for eye" [...] and in [...] in the expression [...] "he shall surely pay ox for ox." [...] As the latter case plainly indicated pecuniary compensation, so must the former.|$|R
40|$|Three sisters lie in {{adjoining}} hospital rooms. A fourth lives a block away. All are in deadly peril. Alice {{is seven}} months pregnant, and the pregnancy threatens her life. Her fetus {{has long been}} viable, so she {{no longer has the}} Roe/Casey right to abortion on demand. But because her life is in jeopardy, she has a constitutional right to save her life by hiring a doctor to perform a post-viability abortion, though it means the death of a viable fetus. She would even have such a right if the pregnancy were only posing a serious threat to her health, rather than threatening her life. Katherine lives next door to the hospital. A person comes into her home and seems to be about to try to kill her (or perhaps to seriously injure, rape, or kidnap her). Katherine may protect her life by killing the invader, even if the invader isn 2 ̆ 7 t morally culpable, for instance if he 2 ̆ 7 s insane or if he mistakenly believes that he 2 ̆ 7 s the one defending himself. Just as Alice may protect herself by killing an innocent fetus who is threatening her life, so Katherine may protect herself by killing even a morally innocent attacker who is threatening her life. And Katherine has a right to self-defense even though recognizing this right increases the chance that some people can use false claims of self-defense to get away with killing the innocent. Ellen, back in the hospital, is terminally ill. No proven therapies offer help. An experimental therapy seems relatively safe, because it has passed Phase I FDA testing, yet federal law bars its use outside clinical trials because it hasn 2 ̆ 7 t been demonstrated to be effective (and further checked for safety) through Phase II testing. Nonetheless, under the D. C. Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs v. Eschenbach, Ellen has a constitutional right to try to save her life by hiring a doctor to administer the therapy. Olivia is dying of kidney failure in the room next to Alice 2 ̆ 7 s and Ellen 2 ̆ 7 s. A kidney transplant would likely save her life, just as an abortion would save Alice 2 ̆ 7 s, lethal self-defense maysave Katherine 2 ̆ 7 s, and an experimental treatment may save Ellen 2 ̆ 7 s. But the federal ban on payment for organs sharply limits the number of available matching kidneys, and Olivia will likely die if she must wait for a donated kidney. <b>Barring</b> <b>compensation</b> for goods or services makes them scarce, and denies many people access to them. Alice and Ellen would be in jeopardy if doctors were only allowed to perform abortions or experimental treatments without compensation. Katherine wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t be able to defend herself with a gun or knife if such weapons could only be donated and not sold. If organ providers, or the heirs of posthumous providers, could be compensated for the organs, many more such organs would be available, and Olivia would be much likelier to get the life-saving kidney. But federal law bans organ sales, and thus frustrates her ability to protect her life. My claim is that all four cases involve the exercise of a person 2 ̆ 7 s presumptive right to self-defense [...] lethal self-defense in Katherine 2 ̆ 7 s case, and what I call medical self-defense in the others. Such a right may be constitutionally founded: Given that Alice has such a right to defend herself by getting an abortion, Ellen and Olivia should have the same right to defend themselves by getting other medical procedures. Alice is entitled to have surgery in which a doctor inserts surgical devices into her body to excise a fetus that, tragically, is threatening her life. Ellen should therefore likewise be entitled to have a procedure in which a doctor inserts chemicals into her body in order to destroy (say) a tumor that is threatening her life. And Olivia should similarly be entitled to have a procedure in which a doctor inserts a replacement organ into her body in order to replace an organ the failure of which is threatening her life. It can 2 ̆ 7 t be that a woman is constitutionally entitled to protect her own life, but only when doing so kills a viable fetus. Such a presumptive right should also be recognized as a moral matter, regardless of one 2 ̆ 7 s views on unenumerated constitutional rights. Even if the Supreme Court stops recognizing unenumerated constitutional rights, legislatures should presumptively protect people 2 ̆ 7 s medical self-defense rights just as they protect people 2 ̆ 7 s lethal self-defense rights, and just as public opinion overwhelmingly supports women 2 ̆ 7 s abortion-as-self-defense rights. While a legislature need not fund the exercise of people 2 ̆ 7 s self-defense, it generally ought not enact laws that substantially burden people 2 ̆ 7 s ability to protect their lives. And while the right [...] like other rights [...] may be trumped by restrictions that are genuinely necessary to serve the most important of government interests, I argue that no such interests justify total bans on compensation for organs, or on the use of experimental drugs...|$|R
