40|$|Purpose: (1) To {{quantify}} {{the effect of}} <b>contact</b> lens wear on straylight in rigid and soft <b>contact</b> lens wearers and (2) to relate findings to morphological changes and subjective complaints. Methods: Straylight was measured using the Oculus C-Quant during <b>contact</b> lens wear and after <b>contact</b> lens removal in 30 rigid <b>contact</b> lens wearers and 30 soft <b>contact</b> lens wearers. Semi-quantitative (0 - 4) slit-lamp grading of anterior segment changes using Efron grading scales and <b>contact</b> lens characteristics were performed. Subjects answered a straylight questionnaire. Results: Soft <b>contact</b> lens wearers had a mean straylight of logarithmic value of the straylight parameter [log(s) ] = 0. 934 during <b>contact</b> lens wear and after <b>contact</b> lens removal [comparable to log(s) = 0. 938 of age-matched normal eyes]. Rigid <b>contact</b> lens wearers had a mean straylight during <b>contact</b> lens wear of log(s) = 1. 167. After <b>contact</b> lens removal, log(s) significantly decreased to 0. 997 (P < 0. 01). Straylight values with rigid <b>contact</b> lenses were strongly increased (P < 0. 001) compared with age-matched normal eyes; after <b>contact</b> lens removal, these values decreased but remained elevated. Straylight in rigid <b>contact</b> lens wearers correlated {{with the amount of}} deposits on the <b>contact</b> lens (P < 0. 01) but not with other variables of the <b>contact</b> lens score. The questionnaire showed more straylight complaints in rigid <b>contact</b> lens wearers than in soft <b>contact</b> lens wearers (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: Rigid <b>contact</b> lens wear leads to increased straylight during <b>contact</b> lens wear and after <b>contact</b> lens removal. This may be because of subclinical effects of <b>contact</b> lens wear on the cornea and is not seen in soft <b>contact</b> lens wearer...|$|R

40|$|The metal <b>contact</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} crucial parts in ohmic-contact {{microelectromechanical}} (MEMS) switches, as it determines the device performance and reliability. It has been observed that there is <b>contact</b> instability when the <b>contact</b> force is below a threshold value (minimum <b>contact</b> force). However, there has been very limited knowledge so far about the unstable electrical <b>contact</b> behavior under low <b>contact</b> force. In this work, the instability of Au-Au micro/nano-contact behavior during the initial stage of <b>contact</b> formation is comprehensively investigated for the first time. It has been found that the alien film on the <b>contact</b> surface plays a critical role in determining the <b>contact</b> behavior at the initial <b>contact</b> stage under low <b>contact</b> force. A strong correlation between <b>contact</b> resistance fluctuation at the initial <b>contact</b> stage and the presence of a hydrocarbon alien film on the <b>contact</b> surface is revealed. The enhancement of <b>contact</b> instability due to the alien film can be explained within a framework of trap-assisted tunneling...|$|R

50|$|In mechanics, a {{unilateral}} <b>contact</b> denotes a mechanical constraint which prevents penetration between two bodies; see figure 1a. These bodies may be rigid or flexible. A unilateral <b>contact</b> is {{usually associated with}} a gap function g which measures {{the distance between the}} two bodies and a <b>contact</b> force. The behaviour of {{a unilateral}} <b>contact</b> is modeled by a force law which states a relation between the gap function and the <b>contact</b> force. Set-valued force laws of type Upr assume a hard <b>contact</b> and clearly distinguish between open <b>contact</b> (<b>contact</b> force equal to zero, gap g is positive) and closed <b>contact</b> (<b>contact</b> force is positive, gap g is zero), see figure 1b.Regularized force laws are associated to compliance models. These laws write the <b>contact</b> force as function of the gap, i.e. the models have the same underlying mathematical structure for closed and open <b>contacts.</b> Unilateral <b>contacts</b> are used in <b>contact</b> dynamics and/or <b>contact</b> mechanics.|$|R

40|$|This {{sequel to}} our {{previous}} paper [MS 11 b] continues {{the study of}} topological <b>contact</b> dynamics and applications to <b>contact</b> dynamics and topological dynamics.

The article includes {{an examination of the}} groups of time-one maps of topological <b>contact</b> and strictly <b>contact</b> isotopies, and the construction of a bi-invariant metric on the latter. Moreover, every topological <b>contact</b> or strictly <b>contact</b> dynamical system is arbitrarily close to a continuous <b>contact</b> or strictly <b>contact</b> dynamical system with the same end point. In particular, the above groups of time-one maps are independent of the choice of norm in the definition of the <b>contact</b> distance. On every <b>contact</b> manifold we construct topological <b>contact</b> dynamical systems with time-one maps that fail to be Lipschitz continuous, and smooth <b>contact</b> vector fields whose flows are topologically conjugate but not conjugate by a <b>contact</b> C^ 1 -diffeomorphism.
