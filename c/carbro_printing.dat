50|$|In 1939 Miller {{decided to}} leave acting for photography. He taught himself the {{difficult}} <b>carbro</b> <b>printing</b> process (which involves lengthy layering of cyan, yellow and magenta pigments individually) and purchased a one-shot color camera which took three images simultaneously, allowing him to render portraits and moving subjects. Before long he had converted a bathroom in his parents' house into a makeshift darkroom so he could begin processing his freelance work, making him the only one at the time working in, and developing, carbro prints.|$|E
50|$|Richard Crump Miller (August 6, 1912 - October 15, 2010) was an American {{photographer}} {{best known}} for his vintage <b>carbro</b> <b>prints,</b> photos of celebrities, and work documenting the Hollywood Freeway.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} fifties and early sixties, Kattelson {{mastered}} the painstaking and almost forgotten technique of <b>Carbro</b> or Carbon <b>print</b> color processing which {{makes use of}} multiple layers of emulsion to create densely saturated, painterly color photographs. The technique, whereby each print is assembled over several days out of individually developed layers of emulsion, dates from the 1870s and by the 1930s had largely fallen out of use {{with the advent of}} dye-transfer <b>printing.</b> Kattelson's <b>carbros,</b> made from images taken in NYC and Mexico, were originally printed on gelatin tissues he obtained from among the last stock manufactured by the McGraw Colorgraph Company in California, a subsidiary of the Carnation Milk Company. When McGraw ceased production he eventually was able to find material from a special run made by a company in Germany. <b>Carbro</b> <b>prints,</b> of which very few exist, have the color density of a gouache painting and are a completely stable, archival color process.|$|R

50|$|In the {{original}} version of the printing process, carbon tissue (a temporary support sheet coated {{with a layer of}} gelatin mixed with a pigmentâ€”originally carbon black, from which the name derives) is bathed in a potassium dichromate sensitizing solution, dried, then exposed to strong ultraviolet light through a photographic negative, hardening the gelatin in proportion to the amount of light reaching it. The tissue is then developed by treatment with warm water, which dissolves the unhardened gelatin. The resulting pigment image is physically transferred to a final support surface, either directly or indirectly. In an important early 20th century variation of the process, known as <b>carbro</b> (carbon-bromide) <b>printing,</b> contact with a conventional silver bromide paper print, rather than exposure to light, was used to selectively harden the gelatin. A wide variety of colored pigments can be used instead of carbon black.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{his return}} to the United States, Kattelson joined the Photo League and studied under Sid Grossman and Paul Strand and later was {{enrolled}} in the Hans Hofmann School of Art. His work was represented in the original 'This is the Photo League' exhibit of 1948 and the 'New Workers' exhibit of 1949. He taught the Basic Technique and Advanced Technique classes in 1949 and 1950 respectively. He served as an executive member and teacher at the Photo League until it disbanded in 1951 during the Red Scare after being declared [...] "subversive" [...] and a front for the Communist Party. The League, while not directly allied with the Communist Party, was originally named the Workers Film and Photo League and had its origins in Europe as the [...] "Workers as Photographers" [...] movement and counted among its members many that were socially and politically progressive. After the disbanding of the League, Kattelson remained close to Grossman and co-edited and <b>printed</b> <b>carbros</b> for Grossman's posthumous 1959 book Journey to the Cape.|$|R
