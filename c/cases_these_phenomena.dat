40|$|The data cache {{organization}} {{of a computer}} can significantly affect overall data access latencies when a program is executed. The cache performance depends on the locality characteristics of the data being processed in a program {{as well as the}} underlying architecture. A typical executing program has a data access profile that exhibits both temporal and spatial locality characteristics. Since most processors contain single data caches at a given level and since the single data cache cannot be optimized for purely spatial nor purely temporal locality data accesses, cache space pollution and inefficient usage of cache resources can occur.

A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was first developed and verified using previously published experimental results. Then two typical beneficial and destructive cyclone cases were studied above different locations of the hills. Results showed that the continuous hilly flow was much more drastic and variable than previously reported normal wind; the mean and turbulent magnitudes became the strongest around the hill top, with the maximum speed-up ratio, turbulence intensity and gust-speed ratio of 1. 1, 0. 32 and 1. 6; the flow over lower hill was greatly affected by the nearby higher hills; the mean and fluctuating quantities were mostly smaller than the corresponding single hill <b>case.</b> <b>These</b> <b>phenomena</b> {{were considered to be}} related with the rather strong detachment and attachment of the cyclone flow around the two hills.

In fact, at T = 0, within a wide range of distance, the potential for two interacting particles is dominated by the pole contribution, which leads to an oscillatory and exponentially damped form (Yukawa oscillations). For the long range, the form of the potential is dominated by the Kohn singularity, which induces oscillatory behavior and is damped as a power-law of the distance (Friedel oscillations).

40|$|How can a {{religion}} be rational and scientific? While formulating my research question {{and preparing for}} my fieldwork among Spiritists in Brazil, that was a recurring question for me. My concern had historical reasons. If for much of nineteenth-century evolutionary thought religion and science were understood to be competitors, {{in the twentieth century}} anthropologists abandoned, for the most part, the idea that religion would be the forerunner of science, a sort of primitive science. Religion was now relegated to a different domain of reality, a matter of inner experience and symbolic meanings. On the other hand, Spiritism takes most of its inspiration from the positivism of Auguste Comte. In this context, Spiritism would be part of the third and last stage of social development proposed by Comte, the positive state, that in which science would be able to explain everything through observation and experimentation.

40|$|The causal {{relationship}} between the biodiversity of natural and modified environments and their net primary production has been a topic of significant scientific controversy and scrutiny. Early theoretical and empirical results indicated that production was sometimes significantly correlated with species richness when species richness was directly manipulated in experimental systems. Possible mechanisms for this phenomenon include statistical sampling effects, complementary resource use and mutualistic interactions. However, the interpretation of experimental results has sometimes confounded species richness with species composition, and disentangling the effects of species diversity from species identity has proved a formidable challenge.

Extinction of operant behavior was facilitated by drug administration following training on either schedule, but this facilitation only occurred once a number of extinction sessions had taken place.

40|$|The Earth is not {{perfectly}} spherical and its {{rotational axis}} is not fixed in space, and these geophysical and kinematic irregularities work as dominant perturbations in satellite orbit propagation. The International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) provides the Conventions as guidelines {{for using the}} Earth’s model and the reference time and coordinate systems defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). These guidelines are directly applied to model orbital dynamics of Earth satellites. In the present work, {{the effects of the}} latest conventions released in 2010 on orbit propagation are investigated by comparison with cases of applying the previous guidelines, IERS Conventions (2003). All seven major updates are tested, i. e., for the models of the precession/nutation, the geopotential, the ocean tides, the ocean pole tides, the free core nutation, the polar motion, and the solar system ephemeris. The resultant position differences for one week of orbit propagation range from tens of meters for the geopotential model change from EGM 96 to EGM 2008 to a few mm for the precession/nutation model change from IAU 2000 to IAU 2006. The along-track differences vary secularly while the cross-track components show periodic variation. However, the radial-track position differences are very small compared with the other components in all <b>cases.</b> <b>These</b> <b>phenomena</b> reflect the variation of the ascending node and the argument of latitude. The reason is that the changed models tested in the current study can be regarded as small fluctuations of the geopotential model {{from the point of view}} of orbital dynamics.

40|$|The {{effects of}} some {{autonomic}} nervous drugs were observ e d in subcutaneous urographies {{as well as}} the different behavior of Pilocarpine and Mecholyl under conditions of parasympathetic nerve block. Their effects up o n intravenous urographies had been studied, and some interesting facts had been found. However, they might be recognizable merely when the concentration of the contrast medium in the blood was so high. Therefore, it seems to be necessary to perform another experiment under a condition in which it is as low as in clinical cases. For this purpose, subcutaneous urography with 30 ml of diluted aqueous Urografin-solution (12. 5 %) containing hyaluronidase (Sprase 500 units per 120 ml of the solution) was undertaken (Exp. I). Dru g s given intramuscularly with or without intravenous Neophyllin-injection were Atropine, Pilocarpine and Mecholyl. The methods of administration and the doses of those drugs were as same as in the previously reported intravenous urographies. The roentgenograms in each animal were obtained at 15, 3 0 and 60 minutes after the injection of the contrast medium. Immediately after th e final roentgenography, urinary quantity, concentration and excreted amount of contrast medium were measured. On such experimental material s {{as well as the}} changes in the sharpness of urograms in each animal, correlations between two phenomena were speculated mathematically. On the other hand, comparisons of those results between intravenous and subcutaneous urographies were made, because the author had expected that the results in the latter would not necessarily coincide with those in the former. By the way, the effects of Pilocarpine and Mecholyl had been studied with a special interest in Part I, and there were found several differences between them, especially the modes of mechanism in affecting the renal tubules and some other secretory glands. And then, the author had concluded the innervation of cholinergic nerve to the urinary secretion as well as the correlation between the systemic autonomic nervous condition and the renal function. But it seems to be too hypothetical to convince them. Hence, their effects to the tubular excretion and the u rograms were observed under a condition of parasympathetic nerve block ensued from intramuscular administration of Triomin-Finalin which {{was supposed to be the}} most effective blocking agent (Exp. II). The main points of the results are as follows : 1) Subcutaneous pyelograms of diagnostic valu e in rabbits can be obtained by use of parasympathicomimetic drugs, such as Pilocarpine and Mecholyl, under a diuretic condition ensued with Neophyllin. 2) It is su g gested that the effect of Neophyllin to promote the excretion of contrast medium is widely different in accordance with the concentration of the latter in the blood. If the concentration is higher than the value of tubular maximum, remarkable increase in excretion of the contrast medium is ensued; and on the contrary, if it is lower than the value, the excretion does not increase essentially, although the urinary quantities increase to some degree to promote the sharpness of pyelograms in both <b>cases.</b> <b>These</b> <b>phenomena</b> can be explained as a result of th e different percentages of its component filtrated by glomeruli and secreted by tubules. 3) The mode of correlation between grades of sharpness of pyelograms and the conditions of excretion of the contrast medium in subcutaneous urographies is somewhat different from that in intravenous urographies, especially in both Neophyllin-groups; namely in Neophyllingroups, i. e., Neophyllin-. Atropine+ Neophyllin-, Pilocarpine+ Neophyllin- and Mecholy 1 + Neophyllin-groups, a positive correlation is recognized between the concentration of excreted contrast medium and the sharpness, and negative one between the urinary quantity and the sharpness. Those are the same relations as in Non-Neophyllin-groups in intravenous urographies. This fact can be explained reasonably from the difference of Neophyllin-effect upon the excretion of the contrast medium in both methods of excretory urographies. 4) It is shown experimentally that the urinary tracts can be cont rasted easily or hardly among various animals and that excretory urography in rabbit is probably one of the most difficult cases. The m ost probable causes for this fact are found in the different states of diuresis and ureteropelvic peristalses. 5) It is con firmed strictly that the grades of sharpness of the pyelograms in excretory urographies are dependent upon the concentration of excreted contrast medium and upon the degree of partial stasis of urine in the renal pelvis. 6) Under the condition of parasympathetic n erve block, Mecholyl can show the same effect upon the tubular secretion as well as the salivary secretion as strong as in the case without nerve block; however, Pilocarpine is quite ineffective upon those secretions. Hence, it is obviously reasonable to conclude that Pilocarpine prod u ces the effects affecting the cholinergic nerve and that, on the contrary, Mecholyl does directly afftecting the cells of secretory glands. 7) It is proved that the changes of the renal function caused by Mecholyl reflect essentially the sensitivity of the secretory cells of renal tubules to the choline-like substances. From the conception, it seems to be possibly true that the diseased kidney of uroli thiasis is in a state of persistent parasympathicotonia. 8) As mentioned above, the effect of Mecholyl does not show the tonus of autonomic nerves itself. Therefore, the value of the Mecholyl-Test is questionable when the result of the test is determined merely by the changes of the blood-pressure. Especially, such conceptions as Type-S=Sympathicotonia and Type-P=Parasympathicotonia should be strictly criticized...|$|E

These cell groups were found chiefly in the interior but also in the peripheral portion of the a. f.; moreover, massive hyaline cartilaginous tissues were scatteringly found in the a. f. That is to say, in the a. f. pretty extensively low-differentiated and progressive changes were seen simultaneously. In addition to these changes, degeneration of cartilaginous tissues was recognized in various portions of the a. f. and especially, usually found in scattered portions of the cartilage cell groups. It may be understood that these pictures are highly significant in respect to the deformation of the vertebral coltumn in the developmental process and moreover, after birth. 4. In the parts of the a. f. constituted of fibrocartilaginous tissue, fish-bone patterned structures were irregular in some places due to the morphological abnormalities of the corpus vertebrae and degenerative changes of the cartilaginous tissue. 5. In the a. f. adjacent to the corpus vertebrae and in the cartilaginous plates adjacent to the corpus vertebrae which were seen on the central surfaces of the epiphysis of the corpus vertebrae and in the parts facing the central portions of bifidities of the corpus vertebrae, the loss of the calcified zones of cartilage was seen in some places, as a result of the degenerative changes of cartilaginous tissue principally, though occasionally, in having no relation to such changes. In the majority of the epiphyseal cartilaginous plates, foci of degeneration were recognized. It may be considered that these changes exert considerable interference in the growth of the corpus vertebrae. 6. In the a. f., free new-formed bone tissues and periostally new-formed bone tissues deposited in the corpus vertebrae were observed here and there. 7. In one place respectively in cases Nos. 1 and 4,fusion of a part of the corpus vertebrae and of the entire vertebrae was recognized. As to the embryological mechanism of these changes further investigation needs to be performed. 8. The areas of clefts of the arcus vertebrae and proc. spinosus were occupied by cartilaginous or fibrous or both; in these cartilaginous tissues, pictures of degeneration were found. Furthermore, as shown in the vertebrae cervicales in case No. 3,there were bifidities of the arcus vertebrae which had been repaired with new-formed bone tissues. 9. In the articulationes intervertebralis, costovertebralis and sacro-iliaca, both degeneration of the articular cartilages and unification of the articular surfaces were observed in many of the joints. A picture of ossification was observable in the peripheral part of the unified articulatio intervertebralis between the os sacrum and the vertebrae coccygeae in case No. 1. It may be understood that in the joints of the vertebral column, degeneration of the articular cartilages and unification of the articular surfaces arise from mechanical factors and, sometimes, that osseous fusion occurs in these joints. 10. The relation between the changes of the ganglia spinalia and nerve bundles of the nervi spinales in the vertebral canal and the deformity of the vertebral column must be a subject for further research. 11. In the costo-chondral junctions foci of degeneration were found in all cases. In case No. 4,the dorsal ends of some costae were articulated with each other. Moreover, in these joints, there were degeneration of articular cartilages, unification of articular surfaces, formation of free new-formed bone tissue and periostal apposition of new bone tissue. It may be considered that the morphological abnormalities of the costae have occurred as secondary results of deformities of the vertebral column. 12. In the bones other than the vertebral column, costae, sternum and os coxae, and in the visceral organs, there was no finding directly related with deformation of the vertebral column. Thus, on the basis of the present pathological findings concerning the "short-spine dogs", the following conclusions may be drawn. It may be regarded that in the vertebral column, low differentiation, progressive changes and degeneration of cartilaginous tissue in the a. f. as well as low accomplishment of ossification occurred in the developmental process and after birth. It may be understood that these processes are principal causes of deformation of the vertebral column and that the morphological abnormalities of the arcus vertebrae and other portions can be induced secondarily...|$|E
40|$|Patchouli oil is {{categorized}} in {{essential oil}} with it’s main component Patchouli Alcohol, patchouli’s leaves and stem contained this oil. Patchouli oil {{widely used in}} perfumes and cosmetic industries. Yield and quality of patchouli oil needs to be improved by using distillation method. Vacuum distillation also called low pressure distillation. To prevent the decomposition of organic coumpounds it is recommended to do distillation with this method. This distillation is mainly used for samples with boiling points above 150 0 C. The principle of heating by using microwave {{is based on a}} direct collision with polar material or solvent and is regulated by two phenomenons which were ionic conduction and dipole rotation. In most <b>cases,</b> <b>these</b> two <b>phenomenon</b> walks simultaneously. Microwave vacuum distillation is a separation of a mixture based on the boiling point’s differences by using a micro wave heatingwhich was more efisient than usual heating. This practicum is a patchouli oil refining which aims to increase patchouli alcohol’s concentration by using micro wave vaccum distillation. While the analysis that conducted are : density analysis, viscosity analysis, acid number analysis, and Patchouli Alcohol’s concentration analysis by using Gas Chromathography. From 6 times practicum with different length refining time obtained Patchouli Alcohol’s concentration average 26, 6 % and a linear regression y= - 0. 0645 x 2 + 2. 2626 x + 14. 811 and R 2 = 0. 9468...|$|R

Although endogenous components captured much of the variance, adding rainfall data improved endogenous ARIMA models and resulted in more realistic forecasts. Using a square-root transformation for the locust data improved the fit. The models were only partially successful when accounting for the dramatic changes in abundance which may occur during locust upsurges and declines, in some <b>cases</b> successfully predicting <b>these</b> <b>phenomena</b> but underestimating their severity. Better fitting models were also produced when rainfall data were added to models of an equivalent series for desert locust hoppers (nymphs) that incorporated lagged data for locust swarms as independent variables, representing parent generations. The results are discussed in relation to predicting likely changes in desert locust dynamics with reference to potential effects of climate change...|$|R

40|$|Context. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are {{the most}} {{luminous}} explosions that we can witness in the Universe. Studying the most extreme <b>cases</b> of <b>these</b> <b>phenomena</b> allows us to constrain the limits for the progenitor models. Aims. In this Letter, we study the prompt emission, afterglow, and host galaxy of GRB[*] 120624 B, {{one of the brightest}} GRBs detected by Fermi, to derive the energetics of the event and characterise the host galaxy in which it was produced. Methods. Following the high-energy detection we conducted a multi-wavelength follow-up campaign, including near-infrared imaging from HAWKI/VLT, optical from OSIRIS/GTC, X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and at submillimetre/millimetre wavelengths from SMA. Optical/NIR spectroscopy was performed with X-shooter/VLT. Results. We detect the X-ray and NIR afterglow of the burst and determine a redshift of z = 2. 1974 ± 0. 0002 through identification of emission lines of [O[*]ii], [O[*]iii] and H-α from the host galaxy of the GRB. This implies an energy release of Eiso,γ = (3. 0 ± 0. 2) × 1054 erg, amongst the most luminous ever detected. The observations of the afterglow indicate high obscuration with AV > 1. 5. The host galaxy is compact, with R 1 / 2 < 1. 6 kpc, but luminous, at L 1. 5 L∗ and has a star formation rate of 91 ± 6 M⊙/yr as derived from Hα. Conclusions. As for other highly obscured GRBs, GRB[*] 120624 B is hosted by a luminous galaxy, which we also prove to be compact, with very intense star formation.
