It is proposed that La/Sm ratios and chrondrite-normalized La abundances of <b>common</b> <b>mare</b> basalts are found in partial melts only if: the mafic cumulate consists mostly of clinopyroxene, a very low fraction of the cumulate melts, and the cumulate represents a moderate to high proportion of the crystallization of the initial magma ocean. Only if the partitioning of clinopyroxene is forced to mimic plagioclase (DLa is greater than DSm) do the present modeling results become compatible with the scenario for producing appropriate parent melts of mare basalts from mafic cumulates. It is found unlikely that parent melts of mare basalts were produced from mafic cumulates of an initial lunar magma ocean that had not had any plagioclase crystallization...|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>mare's</b> tail is a creeping, {{perennial}} herb, {{found in}} shallow waters and mud flats. It roots underwater, {{but most of}} its leaves are above the water surface. The leaves occur in whorls of 6-12; those above water are 0.5 to 2.5 cm long and up to 3 mm wide, whereas those under water are thinner and limper, and longer than those above water, especially in deeper streams. The stems are solid and unbranched but often curve, and can be up to 60 cm long. In shallow water they project 20-30 cm out of the water. It grows from stout rhizomes. The flowers are inconspicuous, and not all plants produce them. Studies of H. vulgaris in the Tibetan Plateau have shown {{that it is a}} prolific methane emitter. H. vulgaris's roots extend into the anoxic zone of wetland soils and create a conduit for methane produced in the anoxic zone to travel to the atmosphere.|$|R

40|$|Phaneritic {{fragments}}, vitrophyres, {{and glass}} beads {{of a new}} very low Ti (VLT) mare basalt {{are found in the}} Apollo 17 drill core. VLT lithic fragments are characterized by TiO 2 content of approximately 0. 5 %, Mg/(Mg + Fe) of approximately 0. 52, CaO/Al 2 O 3 of approximately 0. 9, and low alkali content. Although mineral systematics and modal composition of VLT basalt are similar to Apollo 12 and 15 low Ti basalts, VLT basalts cannot be related to these mare basalts by crystal fractionation. Since VLT basalt is isochemical with some of the less mafic green glasses, fractionation of VLT magma from a liquid of green-glass composition is a possibility.

Crude extracts of mycocin were then extracted by ethyl acetate, and temperature stabilities of them were investigated. The crude extracts of mycocin were tested against pathogenic E. coli and compared both in vivo and in vitro. Three Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and two Kluyveromyces marxianus were isolated from Koumiss in Inner Mongolia. All these yeasts produced mycocin. The two crude extracts of mycocin secreted by K. marxianus were active and stable at temperatures between 25 °C and 45 °C. They had better antibacterial effect in vitro and in vivo and were shown to be effective in preventing E. coli disease in mice.

40|$|In {{light of}} the President s Moon/Mars initiative, lunar {{exploration}} has once again become a priority for NASA. In order to establish permanent bases on the Moon and proceed with human exploration of Mars, two key problems will be addressed: first, the production of O 2 and second, the production of methane (CH 4). While O 2 is required for life support systems (LSS), both liquid O 2 and CH 4 are needed as an oxidizer and a propellant, respectively for the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) and the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV). Unlike previous propulsion systems, the new CEV will use liquid oxygen (LO 2) as an oxidizer and liquid methane (LCH 4) as a propellant. Existing technology (e. g. hydrogen reduction) {{for the production of}} liquid oxygen from lunar regolith is very energy intensive and requires high temperature reactors. We propose an alternative approach using iron-tolerant cyanobacteria. We have found that iron-tolerant cyanobacteria (IT CB) are capable of etching iron-bearing minerals, which may lead to bonds breaking between Fe and O of <b>common</b> lunar <b>mare</b> basalt Fe-oxides including ilmenite, pseudobrookite, ferropseudobrookite, and armalcolite with the subsequent release of both Fe, Ti and oxygen as byproducts. We also propose to use CB biomass for CH 4 production as carbon stock and a propellant. Both processes can be accomplished in an energy and cost effective manner because sunlight will be used as an energy source and allows the reactions at ambient temperatures between 10 - 60 C. Current evaluations include assessing the thermodynamics of such biogenic reactions using a variety of nutrients and atmospheric parameters, as well as assessing the rates and species variation effects of the driving reactions...|$|R
40|$|Recent re-analyses {{of lunar}} samples have {{undoubtedly}} measured indigenous water, challenging {{the paradigm of}} a “dry” Moon, and arguing that some portions of the lunar interior are as wet as some regions of the Earth’s mantle and that water in both planetary bodies likely share a <b>common</b> origin. <b>Mare</b> basalts indirectly sample the lunar mantle and are affected by petrogenetic processes such as crystallization and degassing that can modify characteristics of indigenous water in primary mantle melts. Analyses of apatite in phosphorus-rich KREEP (K + REE [rare earth elements] + P) basalts may provide more reliable estimates for the water content of lunar magmas, as some apatites likely crystallized before substantial degassing occurred. In lunar KREEP basalt sample 15386, apatite H 2 O content and H isotopic composition suggest that degassing occurred during apatite crystallization, the lowest δD value of 90 ‰ ± 100 ‰ representing an upper limit for the isotopic composition {{of water in the}} parental magma. Interpretation of the data for KREEP basalt 15386 suggests that this basalt is characterized by relatively elevated H 2 O contents and CI chondrite–type δD values, similar to those proposed for other mare basalts and pyroclastic glasses. On the other hand, most of the apatites in lunar KREEP basalt 72275 and lunar meteorite NWA 773 crystallized before degassing and H isotope fractionation, and their D/H ratios thus directly reflect those of their source regions. These apatites have an average δD value of – 130 ‰ ± 50 ‰, suggesting the presence of a water reservoir in the Moon characterized by moderate H 2 O contents and H isotopic composition similar to that of Earth’s interior. These findings imply that significant amounts of water in the Moon were inherited from the proto-Earth, surviving the purported Moon-forming impact event...|$|R
50|$|The {{precursor}} to the English parliamentary system was a Magnum Concilium or great council, an advice chamber to the king consisting of peers, ecclesiastics, and Knights of the Shire (with the king summoning two of these from each county). In 1264, this council evolved to include representatives from the boroughs (burgesses), requiring that all members be elected (Montfort's Parliament). The parliament gained legislative powers in 1295 (the Model Parliament). In the following century Edward III split parliament into its current bicameral structure, which includes the House of Commons and the House of Lords, in 1341. It opted in 1376 to appoint Sir Peter de la Mare to convey to the Lords complaints about heavy taxes, demands for an accounting of the royal expenditures, and criticism of the king's management of the military. Although de la Mare was imprisoned for his actions, many recognised {{the value of a}} single representative voice for the Commons.

40|$|AbstractCorticotherapy is a <b>common</b> {{treatment}} in <b>mares</b> susceptible to endometritis. Isoflupredone improves pregnancy rates and affects the protein profile of endometrial fluid {{in comparison to}} untreated mares. Dexamethasone decreases postbreeding fluid accumulation and uterine edema; however, its effects on the protein profile of the endometrial fluid {{have not yet been}} studied. The aim {{of the present study was}} to verify the effect of dexamethasone on the protein profile of endometrial fluid, in the presence or absence of infection, from mares susceptible to persistent postbreeding endometritis. Nine susceptible mares aged between 7 and 18  years were used. After checking for signs of estrus, mares were subjected to four treatments: C: mares received no treatment and served as control; D: mares received 40 -mg dexamethasone at breeding, with collection of samples after 6  hours; I- 6 and I- 24 : intrauterine infusion of 1  ×  109 Streptococcus zooepidemicus/mL and samples collected after 6 and 24  hours; I/D- 6 and I/D- 24 : intrauterine infusion of 1  ×  109 S zooepidemicus/mL and 40 -mg dexamethasone, collecting the sample after 6 and 24  hours. All mares were subjected to all treatments. Samples were collected and subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry for the identification of relevant protein spots. Corticotherapy altered the protein profile of the endometrial fluid of susceptible mares, characterized by an increase and/or decrease in the optical density of inflammatory acute-phase proteins. We conclude that the use of dexamethasone in mares with and without infection alters the protein profile of endometrial fluid of susceptible mares...|$|R
40|$|The broad {{ligament}} is {{a double}} peritoneal membrane connecting the abdominal wall and the uterus, and the blood vessels pass through the broad ligament to supply the uterus. In aged mares, broad ligament hematoma that often leads to the death by blood loss can occur in perinatal period. It is difficult to arrest hemorrhage by surgical procedure and to estimate and prevent the broad ligament hematoma, because there are few case reports on the sites of arterial rupture, etiology and pathogenesis of the broad ligament hematoma in pregnant mares. The present study purposes elucidating 1) clinical findings of broad ligament hematoma by hearing investigation for owners and clinical veterinarians, 2) preferential rupture sites of blood vessels by necropsy, 3) mechanisms of the arterial ruptures by histopathological examination, and 4) aging changes of the arteries predisposed to the broad ligament hematoma. In the first chapter, the breeding site of 36 Thoroughbred mares died of broad ligament hematoma in perinatal period was identified by necropsy. I also interviewed owners and clinical veterinarians treated the horses. The {{mean age of the}} affected mares was 17. 15 ± 3. 43 years (S. D.), and the parity was 9. 86 ± 2. 85 times (S. D.). Thirty mares showed clinical signs after delivery, and 18 of the 19 mares in which the time course between delivery and death could be specified, died within 24 hours after delivery. At necropsy, rupture sites were identified in 31 of 36 mares, and the sites were located in the uterine artery (24 mares), internal pudendal artery (5 mares), caudal mesenteric artery (1 mare), and internal iliac artery (1 mare). Among these, the proximal uterine artery that lies near the bifurcation from the iliac artery was the most frequent site of rupture. The arterial ruptures occurred 4 times more frequently at the left side than the right. The rupture at uterine artery tended to occur in aged mare. The arterial ruptures preferably occurred at arterial bifurcations subjected to severe hemodynamic stress. Most of the ruptures were a tear in the arterial wall, but in other cases, the arteries were completely transected. The broad ligament hematoma usually occurred in mares older than 14 years. The proximal part of uterine artery that is the preferential site for rupture can be monitored by transrectal echography. Therefore, the proximal part of uterine artery should be check primarily using transrectal echography in the mares suspected of broad ligament hematoma. The antemortem identification of rupture sites may enable the arrest of hemorrhage by surgical procedure. In the second chapter, I pathologically examined 31 mares in which the rupture sites were macroscopically identified and investigated the mechanisms of the arterial ruptures. The morphology of the ruptures was classified into three types: rupture with longitudinal fissures, rupture without longitudinal fissures, and transection. The arterial ruptures with fissures occurred only in the proximal uterine artery, and transections mainly occurred in the internal pudendal artery. Histologically, fibrosis of the tunica media and thickened tunica intima were observed adjacent to the arterial ruptures, and these changes were observed commonly {{on both sides of the}} ruptured and apparently intact arterial walls. Therefore, these arterial change might be related with aging and multiparity. The lumen of some proximal uterine artery without rupture was partially dilated with thin arterial wall, forming small aneurism. These changes might be the result of hemodynamic stress to the arterial wall and similar lesions were observed in distal uterine artery forming spiral shape. The middle to distal uterine artery had abundant longitudinal smooth muscle fasicles in the tunica adventitia, and the luminal surface of these area formed circumferential ridges and grooves. These structures might make the middle to distal uterine artery more resistant to mechanical forces such as tugging and increased blood pressure, and might contribute to lower incidence of arterial ruptures in those areas in compare with that of proximal uterine artery. Coagulative necrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells were observed at the rupture sites of the internal pudendal artery. These changes were not observed in other arteries. The internal pudendal artery runs between the uterus and pelvis, and the artery may be injured due to being caught between them during pregnancy or parturition. Therefore, the cause of internal pudendal artery rupture may be physical injury by the external forces. At the ruptured edge of internal iliac artery, circular smooth muscles of the tunica media were crossed with longitudinal smooth muscle bundles and collagen fibers. Due to its structure, the artery might be poorly dilative and increased blood pressure may cause arterial rupture. The caudal mesenteric artery of one mare was transected, and blood cells flooded among smooth muscle cells in tunica media at elongated edge of transected artery. Since this mare suffered dystocia due to an excessively-sized fetus, arterial rupture might occur at parturition by vigorous traction of caudal mesenterium, small colon and rectum. The present study revealed that broad ligament hematoma in mares had preferential site for arterial rupture, the proximal uterine artery, but the rupture may also occur in other arteries with different mechanisms. Therefore, ruptured sites should be sought at necropsy and therapy considering the age of mare, number of delivery, extent of dytocia and size of fetus. In the third chapter, the uterine artery and external iliac artery of mares of variable ages without broad ligament hematoma were histologically examined to determine whether the histological lesions of arteries described in the former chapter at non-rupture sites were the specific change for mares with broad ligament hematoma or aging changes <b>common</b> for <b>mares.</b> The mares had the same arterial changes in uterine artery as observed in the mare with broad ligament hematoma and they were congruent with aging changes of arteries in humans and rats. The aging changes included an atrophy of smooth muscle cells with medial fibrosis. The fibrotic area of the uterine artery appeared irregularly-shaped thick bands in the proximal part and regular thin bands in middle and distal uterine artery. The other aging changes were the disruption of internal elastic lamina and thickening of tunica intima due to an increase of collagenous stroma and proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Tunica intima of the proximal uterine artery was thicker than those of middle and proximal arteries, reflecting the different magnitude of hemodynamic stress on the uterine artery. The results of morphometrical analysis confirmed the aging changes of arterial walls. In the tunica media of external iliac artery, a decrease of elastin and an increase of collagen with aging were detected by routine histopathology, but the age-dependency was not substantiated by the morphometrical analysis. The result of this chapter indicates the histological changes of arteries described in the chapter 2 was aging change <b>common</b> to <b>mares</b> and the degree of the aging changes differed among arteries and areas of arteries. These changes were more prominent at the proximal part of uterine artery, the most frequent site of arterial rupture in aged mares, thus the aging change were considered to be one of the predisposing lesions for the arterial rupture resulting in broad ligament hematoma. Arterial lesions with aging may elevate systolic pressure of arteries and increase the risk of arterial rupture. Therefore, daily monitoring of blood pressure might be helpful in evaluating the risk of broad ligament hematoma in aged mares at perinatal period...|$|R
40|$|Chromosome {{preparations}} {{were derived}} from short-term cultures of blood lymphocytes and from fibroblast-type cell cultures of subcutaneous fascia obtained from 44 clinically normal horses. The quality of mitotic cells compared favourably with similar studies in other species. Some characteristic morphological features were found which aid in the recognition of certain chromosomes, but the identification of many homologous pairs by conventional techniques was difficult. The normal karyotype of the horse (2 n = 64) was characterized following Giemsa staining and C-banding. The latter procedure was {{shown to be a}} valuable aid for the identification of specific chromosomes, in particular the sex chromosomes. After centromere staining, the X chromosome of the horse is characterized by the presence of prominent C-bands on its long arms, while the Y chromosome appears as an intensely-stained block. Analysis of mitotic chromosomes prepared from ten phenotypically normal but infertile mares revealed, in one animal, the consistent lack of one sex chromosome in the four tissues studied. Centromere staining and sex chromatin studies confirmed that this mare had the karyotype 63 XO. Examination of the genitalia of this XO mare disclosed the presence of apparently normal reproductive organs except that macroscopic follicles were absent from both ovaries. Histologically, a number of presumptive atretic Graafian follicles and a discrete area of apparently functional luteal tissue were discovered in the right ovary. The significance of these findings are discussed and compared with the features of the analogous syndromes associated with the XO anomaly in other species. It is suggested that disorders of the sex chromosomes may occur commonly in horses and may contribute significantly towards the low fertility of the thoroughbred mare. Attention is drawn to the important practical applications of cytogenetic studies in the investigation of infertility in broodmares, and in the certification for sale of young horses intended for use as breeding stock. Cytogenetic studies of spontaneous abortions in women have established that a large proportion of pregnancy wastage in humans is due to chromosome aberrations. The counterparts of many of the chromosome errors initially described in humans have now been reported among domestic animals. In particular, the XO anomaly seems remarkably <b>common</b> among infertile <b>mares.</b> These findings have indicated that chromosomal abnormalities may {{play a significant role in}} the aetiology of spontaneous abortion and embryonic loss in domestic animals. To investigate an hypothesis that chromosome anomalies are an important cause of prenatal loss in the mare, an attempt was made to analyze, cytogenetically, a series of equine abortions. From a range of tissues obtained from 26 aborted foals, cell cultures were prepared but failed to grow, and chromosome analysis was therefore not possible for any of these specimens. It seems that the equine foetus is retained in the uterus of the mare for a considerable period after the foetus has died and usually consists of partially-autolyzed non-vital tissues at the time of its expulsion. Consequently, a study was made of the metaphase chromosomes prepared from 22 equine embryos after their surgical removal from mares' uteri. A normal karyotype was found in each specimen. Although inconclusive on their own, the results of this study form an important contribution towards cumulative studies of embryonic loss in the horse. The current findings are discussed in the light of similar studies of induced abortions in women and embryonic loss in animals, and the potential for further investigation in this field is emphasized. From the limited number of cytogenetic studies in domestic animals, it appears that chromosome analyses, particularly with the aid of more refined techniques such as centromere staining, may be of considerable value in investigations of infertility and embryonic loss in the horse...|$|R
