5|$|A {{request by}} the state to dismiss the suit was denied in August 1966, and the case was {{eventually}} heard {{by the state}} Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. In the meantime, the state built the easternmost mile (1.6km) of the new alignment, which was not affected by the lawsuit. On July7, 1967, the court ruled 6–1 in favor of the Sleepy Hollow Valley Committee. As a result, the western half of the new road was moved an additional mile to the north, bypassing North Tarrytown <b>completely.</b> <b>The</b> new alignment of NY117 was completed in November1970 and its former alignment along Bedford Road was redesignated as NY448.|$|E

5|$|At metamorphosis, {{rapid changes}} in the body take place as the {{lifestyle}} of the frog changes <b>completely.</b> <b>The</b> spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a large jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, and a tongue is formed. There are associated {{changes in the}} neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system. All this can happen in about a day. A few days later, the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place.|$|E

Various outlying forts were also strengthened with the aim of obstructing the Portuguese works and forcing them to build a larger circumvallation line.

5|$|As Boyd took off, another C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel John Delmore {{closed in}} on Khâm Đức. At an {{altitude}} of about 300 to 400 feet, Delmore's aircraft began to receive North Vietnamese fire, and {{both sides of the}} cockpit were opened up by bullets that had ripped through the floorboards. Subsequently, just before touch down, Delmore and his co-pilot shut down the engine and forced the aircraft to remain upright. With no brakes and little directional control, the aircraft crashed into the CH-47 that had been destroyed early in the morning, but Delmore managed to turn his aircraft off the runway to avoid blocking it. When the aircraft had stopped <b>completely,</b> <b>the</b> five-man crew got out as quickly as they could. About 20 minutes later, U.S. soldiers on the ground guided them to safety, and they were rescued by a U.S. Marine CH-46. After witnessing the destruction of two C-130 Hercules, Lieutenant Colonel Franklin Montgomery landed his C-130 and extracted more than 150 Vietnamese civilians, and some CIDG and U.S. soldiers. Montgomery's aircraft suffered no hits, but the loadmaster was knocked down and trampled by panic-stricken Vietnamese civilians whilst trying to maintain order.|$|E
5|$|Blackleg is a {{fungal disease}} of canola {{that results in}} major yield loss in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) that is left on farm fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until the stubble is buried or broken down <b>completely.</b> <b>The</b> observation that C.olla grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola stubble, and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne diseases like blackleg and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize canola, wheat, and barley residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue.|$|E
