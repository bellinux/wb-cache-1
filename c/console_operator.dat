50|$|Three days previously, in {{the first}} launch attempt, the launch was stopped at T−7 seconds, {{just prior to the}} SSMEs' {{ignition}} sequence, due to a senior <b>console</b> <b>operator</b> manually triggering a cutoff in the countdown. It was later determined that the <b>console</b> <b>operator,</b> monitoring the hydrogen gas concentration in the Space Shuttle's aft compartment, where the three SSMEs are located, was fooled by the gas detector's purge cycle, which generated a dangerously high, but spurious, reading in the last seconds of the countdown.|$|E

5000|$|The TSPS system {{provided}} a temporary switched {{connection to a}} toll operator who helped facilitate calls requiring human assistance such as person-to-person, collect, third-party-billed, and hotel billing. The TSPS system supported up to seven [...] "Chief Operator Groups" [...] (COGs) with each COG supporting up to 31 <b>operator</b> <b>consoles.</b> <b>Operator</b> <b>consoles</b> initially used nixie tube displays that were quickly replaced by light-emitting diode displays due to reliability issues.|$|R
50|$|The system console, {{computer}} <b>console,</b> root <b>console,</b> <b>operator's</b> <b>console,</b> {{or simply}} console is the text entry and display device for system administration messages, particularly {{those from the}} BIOS or boot loader, the kernel, from the init system and from the system logger. It is a physical device consisting of a keyboard and a screen, and traditionally is a text terminal, but {{may also be a}} graphical terminal. System consoles are generalized to computer terminals, which are abstracted respectively by virtual consoles and terminal emulators. Today communication with system consoles is generally done abstractly, via the standard streams (stdin, stdout, and stderr), but there may be system-specific interfaces, for example those used by the system kernel.|$|R

The output signals from the FOH console connects to a Sound reinforcement system. Other non-audio crew members, such as the lighting <b>console</b> <b>operator,</b> might also work from the FOH position, since they need to be able to see the show from the audience's perspective.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} the Abacab tour started in Barcelona, on September 25, 1981, not only were there 50 active VL1's, plus spares, but also a brand new multi-processor control desk, with {{software}} written by Brooks Taylor.

5000|$|Preset {{boards are}} the most basic {{lighting}} consoles - and also the most prevalent in smaller installations. They consist {{of two or more}} identical fader banks, called scenes. The faders (control slides) on these scenes can be manually adjusted. Each scene has the same number of channels which control the same dimmers. So the <b>console</b> <b>operator</b> can build a scene offline or in [...] "blind", a cross-fader or submaster is used to selectively mix or fade between the different scenes.|$|E
5000|$|Whittle {{was born}} in New York City to a British {{stewardess}} and William Joseph Whittle, a hotel manager. He is the oldest of four children. Whittle spent his youth in Bermuda, where he attended Warwick Academy and Saltus Grammar School, and later moved {{with his family to}} south Florida in the early 1970s. At age 13, he began working at the Miami Space Transit Planetarium and was made a <b>console</b> <b>operator</b> by its director Jack Horkheimer after a few months.

5000|$|The Upper Enclosure (UPE—the [...] "box" [...] {{on which}} a moving head is mounted) {{contained}} the power supply for the lamp (the APS250) and a Data Receiver Card—a PCB which translated the cue information received from the console into low voltages; these were then (mostly) sent via a wiring harness to a servo amplifier card in the head, which provided the actual power that drove the motors. The Data Receiver Card also translated the lamp Start and Douse commands from the console and fed them to the APS, allowing the lamps to be switched on and off remotely, by the <b>console</b> <b>operator.</b>|$|E

5|$|Other major {{subsystems}} in the E-3 Sentry are navigation, communications, and computers. Fourteen consoles display computer-processed data in graphic and {{tabular format}} on video screens. <b>Console</b> <b>operators</b> perform surveillance, identification, weapons control, battle management and communications functions. The radar and computer subsystems on the E-3 can gather and present broad and detailed battlefield information. This includes position and tracking information on enemy aircraft and ships, and location {{and status of}} friendly aircraft and naval vessels. The information {{can be sent to}} major command and control centers in rear areas or aboard ships. In times of crisis, data can be forwarded to the National Command Authority in the U.S. via RC-135 or naval aircraft carrier task forces.|$|R

50|$|The Commodore-64 was {{a simple}} computer, based on the MOS Technology 6502 8-bit microprocessor, with 64 {{kilobytes}} of RAM, only 38k of which was available for program code and variables {{that could be used}} by the built-in BASIC programming language interpreter. Nevertheless, several different BBS programs were developed (including DS2) by various independent programmers (mostly hobbyists not affiliated with any large software publisher) that enabled a System Operator (SysOp) to run a single-user, multiple member online community supporting threaded topical discussions, on-line games; information reference library, live chat mode with the <b>console</b> <b>operator,</b> file-sharing library and the ability to create a customized user experience in BASIC, thus the Developers System title.|$|E
