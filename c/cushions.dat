5|$|During the {{funerals}} of Soviet leaders {{there was a}} custom of displaying their decorations on velvet <b>cushions,</b> which were carried in the procession behind the coffin. This task was traditionally given to an escort of senior officers, each carrying a cushion with one decoration on it.

50|$|The {{amount of}} shock {{transmitted}} {{by a particular}} <b>cushioning</b> material is largely dependent on {{the thickness of the}} <b>cushion,</b> the drop height, and the load-bearing area of the <b>cushion</b> (static loading). A <b>cushion</b> must deform under shock for it to function. If a product is on a large load-bearing area, the <b>cushion</b> may not deform and will not <b>cushion</b> the shock. If the load-bearing area is too small, the product may “bottom out” during a shock; the shock is not <b>cushioned.</b> Engineers use “cushion curves” to choose the best thickness and load-bearing area for a <b>cushioning</b> material. Often two to three inches (50 - 75 mm) of <b>cushioning</b> are needed to protect fragile items.|$|R

5|$|Before take-off, D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam <b>cushions</b> {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under the {{instructor}} navigator's seat in the aft section of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into the heater from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed <b>cushions</b> ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{architecture}} {{is a combination}} between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (fusuma) were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on <b>cushions</b> or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.|$|E
5|$|Most boulderers use {{gymnastics}} chalk {{on their}} hands to absorb sweat. It is stored in a small chalkbag which can be tied around the waist, allowing the climber to reapply chalk during the climb. Brushes are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs; they are often attached {{to the end of}} a stick, pipe, or other straight object in order to reach higher holds. Crash pads, also referred to as bouldering mats, are foam <b>cushions</b> placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls.|$|E
5|$|The lumbar (or lower back) {{region is}} made up of five {{vertebrae}} (L1–L5), sometimes including the sacrum. In between these vertebrae are fibrocartilaginous discs, which act as <b>cushions,</b> preventing the vertebrae from rubbing together {{while at the same time}} protecting the spinal cord. Nerves come from and go to the spinal cord through specific openings between the vertebrae, providing the skin with sensations and messages to muscles. Stability of the spine is provided by the ligaments and muscles of the back and abdomen. Small joints called facet joints limit and direct the motion of the spine.|$|E
40|$|Distribution {{packaging}} design often relies on <b>cushion</b> curves to determine required material thickness needed for product protection during shipment. The material thickness chosen based on <b>cushion</b> curves establishes overall package size, a key determiner of logistics costs. <b>Cushion</b> curves are constructed by dropping a mass onto a <b>cushion,</b> and interpreting the resulting shock pulse deceleration. The reported deceleration {{can be highly}} influenced by applying a “filter ” to the shock pulse, a useful standard prac-tice that removes unwanted high frequency elements superimposed {{on top of the}} basic shock pulse shape. Standard test methods for generating <b>cushion</b> curves generally do not require reporting what filter was used, or whether the filter influenced the resulting <b>cushion</b> curve information. This paper demonstrates quantitatively how shock pulse filtering influences <b>cushion</b> curves and <b>cushion</b> thickness, which in turn affects logistics costs...|$|R
40|$|Stresses {{developed}} within flesh {{in contact}} with a <b>cushion</b> are examined analytically. Compressive, tensile, and shear stresses within flesh in proximity to a bone are given {{as a function of}} <b>cushion</b> stiff-ness (major parameter) and the overall Poisson's ratio of flesh (minor parameter). It is shown that an individual already sitting on a soft <b>cushion</b> re-cieves relatively minor benefit when a still softer <b>cushion</b> is substi-tuted. This result follows from the fairly flat (saturated) trend of both shear and tensile stress with respect to <b>cushion</b> stiffness, once the soft <b>cushion</b> domain (less than 10 PSI) is entered. Only flesh normal stress (compression) responds significantly to incremental changes of stiff-ness within the soft <b>cushion</b> range; reducing the <b>cushion</b> stiffness 50 percent will typically reduce local compressive stress by roughly 20 percent. While such a gain is real, it is also modest...|$|R

5|$|The osteoderms of ankylosaurids were thin in {{comparison}} {{to those of other}} ankylosaurs, and appear to have been strengthened by randomly distributed <b>cushions</b> of collagen fibers. These were structurally similar to Sharpey's fibers, and were embedded directly into the bone tissue, a feature unique to ankylosaurids. This would have provided the ankylosaurids with an armor covering which was both lightweight and highly durable, being resistant to breakage and penetration by the teeth of predators. The palpebral bones over the eyes may have provided additional protection for them. Carpenter suggested in 1982 that the heavily vascularized armor may also have had a role in thermoregulation as in modern crocodilians.|$|E

40|$|Rock shed {{is widely}} used in traffic lines against {{rockfall}}. In order to <b>cushion</b> rockfall impact and dissipate impact energy, <b>cushion</b> layer is usually adopted in rock shed. Used tire <b>cushion</b> layer is proposed in this paper and it can <b>cushion</b> rockfall impact utilizing large radial deformation of tire. Reinforced concrete structure model is built with used tire <b>cushion</b> layer and artificial rockfall test is carried out. Twelve tests are divided into 4 sets with different rockfall mass, rockfall height, and tire filling material. Simplified calculation model with spring-damper is derived from radial repeated compression test of used tire, which improves the calculation efficiency. Test and numerical simulation show that application of used tire <b>cushion</b> layer in rock shed can <b>cushion</b> rockfall impact and effectively reduce peak acceleration and the maximum impact force. Filling sand and gravel in tire can improve tire stiffness and energy absorption capacity but will decrease <b>cushion</b> effect due to its large density.

The original B35/46 specification sought a jettisonable crew compartment, this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment, the rear crew's escape system was often an issue of controversy, such as when a practical refit scheme was rejected. A rudimentary sixth seat forward of the navigator radar was provided for an additional crew member; the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and forward of the AEO.

Shot after shot were made in lightning rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the rail, crossing over, with two <b>cushions</b> and counting, going under hats and in between them, cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds of others too complicated to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty played a game with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left the balls in a scattered position, which were gathered at one shot by Mr. Adams, who made fifty shots in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, making a carom on all of the balls and freezing against the last ball. Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, with wooden pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a small wooden pulpit, which serves as a lectern that is accessible by a small wooden step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped with wooden crown molding. Wooden swag moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and the transom window. The wooden pews are simple, with <b>cushions</b> added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl space. Within the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|E

25|$|Speed <b>cushions</b> are a type {{of speed}} hump {{installation}} designed to alleviate the negative impacts that vertical deflections have on emergency vehicle response times. Speed <b>cushions</b> installations are typically made up of several small speed humps installed across {{the width of the}} road with spaces between them.
