5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered what might have happened if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men <b>could</b> <b>finish</b> off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} first studies at the Real Colegio de San Carlos in February 1777, graduating in philosophy, logic, physics and metaphysics. He studied with Hipólito Vieytes, and ended his {{secondary}} education on 17 February 1779. He moved to Córdoba the following year, to get university studies of theology at the National University of Córdoba. Despite a brief return to Buenos Aires during his second year because of health problems, he <b>could</b> <b>finish</b> all the syllabus. He got his doctorate in theology and physics on 16 July 1785. He got his degree at the Church of the Company from interim provost Fray Pedro Gaitán.|$|E
5|$|Hooper {{produced}} the film {{for less than}} $300,000 (about $ adjusted for inflation) and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from central Texas, where the film was shot. The limited budget forced Hooper to film for long hours seven days a week, so that he <b>could</b> <b>finish</b> {{as quickly as possible}} and reduce equipment rental costs. Due to the film's violent content, Hooper struggled to find a distributor. Louis Perano of Bryanston Pictures eventually purchased the distribution rights. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, as Presley's fame was soaring, he {{received}} a draft notice from the Memphis Draft Board, but was given a deferment so he <b>could</b> <b>finish</b> his latest film production, King Creole. During Presley's two-year military service in Germany, RCA Victor and Paramount Pictures progressively released material he had completed prior to enlistment. During his last months in the Army, Presley experimented with new sounds and worked on further improving his performance. He also prepared material for his first session in Nashville, which was scheduled to take place upon his return. Presley returned to the United States on March 2, 1960. The singer reunited with his original band The Blue Moon Boys, excepting bassist Bill Black. The first session was held on March 20–21 and the second session was held on April 3–4, completing the album.|$|E
5|$|In the 2014–15 season, the Carolina Panthers won the NFC South with a 7–8–1 record. By week 16, no team in that {{division}} <b>could</b> <b>finish</b> {{with more}} than seven wins. The Panthers then defeated the Atlanta Falcons, who were 6–9 and undefeated within the division entering the game, for the division title. They hosted and defeated the 11–5 Arizona Cardinals in the wild card round. The best team to miss the playoffs that year was the Philadelphia Eagles, who finished 10–6. To date, the 2014 Panthers and 2010 Seahawks {{are the only two}} teams to win a division, and a playoff game, with a losing record.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1895, on the orders of the Patriarch of Karlovci, Georgije I, the Congress Board of Sremski Karlovci {{commissioned}} the young realist Paja Jovanović to paint Migration of the Serbs, intending {{for it to be}} displayed as part of the Serb pavilion. Georgije had originally approached the artist Uroš Predić, but Predić said it would take him two years to complete the painting. Jovanović assured the Patriarch that he <b>could</b> <b>finish</b> the work in eight months. The painting was one of two works that Jovanović was hired to paint for the Exhibition, the other being the Vršac triptych, which was commissioned by the Vršac city council.|$|E

5|$|Six {{weeks from}} {{theatrical}} release, no dubbing {{had taken place}} and the score had not been written as Horner was unable to view the completed film. The final cue for the scene in which Ripley battles the alien queen was written overnight. Cameron completely reworked the scene, leaving Horner to rewrite the music. As Gale Hurd {{did not have much}} music production experience, she and Cameron denied Horner's request to push the film back four weeks so he <b>could</b> <b>finish</b> the score. Horner felt that, given more time, he could get the score to 100% of his satisfaction rather than the 80% he estimated {{he had been able to}} achieve. The score was recorded in roughly four days. Despite his troubles, Horner received an Academy Award nomination (his first) for Best Original Score.|$|E
5|$|Safeties are {{the least}} common method of scoring in American {{football}} but are not rare occurrences– since 1932, a safety has occurred once every 14.31 games in the National Football League (NFL), or {{about once a week}} under current scheduling rules. On October 21, 1973, Fred Dryer, playing for the Los Angeles Rams against the Green Bay Packers, became the only player in NFL History to score two safeties in a single game. A much rarer occurrence is the one-point safety, which can be scored by the offense on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt; those have occurred at least twice in NCAA Division I football since 1996, most recently at the 2013 Fiesta Bowl. No conversion safeties have occurred since at least 1940 in the NFL. A conversion safety by the defense is also possible, though highly unlikely; although this has never occurred, it is the only possible way a team <b>could</b> <b>finish</b> with a single point in an American football game.|$|E
5|$|Season ten {{revealed}} that Lex had manufactured {{a number of}} clones {{in an attempt to}} use to heal himself. However, the majority of these clones are flawed and would age at an accelerated rate. One clone of Lex (Mackenzie Gray), aged approximately twenty years older than the original, attempted to get revenge on Clark by trying to kill Lois Lane (Erica Durance) but died before he <b>could</b> <b>finish.</b> The 2-hour series finale reveals Lex had used the parts of other clones to create a composite one but lacked a heart. After an alternate reality version of his father sacrifices himself to Darkseid, Lex is brought back to life through his clone. He speaks with Clark, telling his former friend he accepts they have a destiny as enemies, but neither of them can fulfill their roles unless Clark defeats Darkseid by inspiring humanity. Lex later meets with Tess, and fatally stabs his sister, however, Tess poisons him with a specialized neurotoxin that removes all of Lex's memories. The series ends by shifting seven years into the future, where Lex had been elected as the President of the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{rights to}} Steig's book were {{originally}} bought by Steven Spielberg in 1991, before {{the founding of}} DreamWorks, when he thought about making a traditionally animated film based on the book. However, John H. Williams convinced him to bring the film to DreamWorks in 1994, the time the studio was founded, and the film was put quickly into active development by Jeffrey Katzenberg after the rights were bought by the studio in 1995. Chris Farley was originally cast as the voice for the title character, recording about 80%–90% of his dialogue. After Farley died in 1997 before he <b>could</b> <b>finish,</b> Mike Myers {{was brought in to}} work for the character, who, after his first recording, decided to record his voice in a Scottish accent. The film was also originally planned to be motion-captured, but after poor results, the studio decided to recruit Pacific Data Images to help Shrek get its final computer-animated look.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no.A4850, and {{one more}} on 28 April. This last day's {{fighting}} left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an Albatros D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot {{it out in a}} head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine on the brink of seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he <b>could</b> <b>finish</b> thanking God, then dictating his combat report.|$|E
5|$|Broke himself led {{a charge}} against {{a number of}} the Americans who had managed to rally on the forecastle. Three American sailors, {{probably}} from the rigging, descended and attacked him. Taken by surprise, he killed the first, but the second hit him with a musket which stunned him, whilst the third sliced open his skull with his sabre, knocking him to the deck. Before the sailor <b>could</b> <b>finish</b> Broke off, the American was bayoneted by a British Marine named John Hill. Shannons crew rallied to the defence of their captain and carried the forecastle, killing the remaining Americans. Broke sat, dizzied and weak, on a carronade slide, and his head was bound up by William Mindham, who used his own neckerchief. One of Shannons lieutenants, Provo Wallis, believed that Broke's three assailants were probably British deserters. The desperate and violent attempt on Broke's life made by these men may have been motivated {{by the fact that they}} faced the death penalty under the Royal Navy's Articles of War as deserters. Meanwhile, Shannons First Lieutenant, Mr George T. L. Watt, had attempted to hoist the British colours over Chesapeakes, but this was misinterpreted aboard Shannon, and he was hit in the forehead by grapeshot and killed as he did so.|$|E

5|$|With The Legacy finally formed, Manu and Snuka {{still wanted}} revenge on Orton. Fearing {{they would try}} to {{convince}} Raw general manager Stephanie McMahon to fire him, Orton went to speak to her himself but their conversation ended in an argument. When Vince McMahon, Stephanie's father, made his return that night Orton maintained he was owed an apology. His brashness angered McMahon who responded by trying to fire Orton, but before he <b>could</b> <b>finish</b> his sentence Orton slapped McMahon and gave him a running punt which left him hospitalized in the storyline. During the 30-man Royal Rumble match that Sunday the group worked as a team, making them three of the last four contestants in the ring with Triple H as the other. Ultimately, in throwing out Rhodes and DiBiase, Triple H was distracted enough to allow Orton to throw him over the top rope and win the match. The next evening on Raw, The Legacy came to the ring accompanied by lawyers and doctors, with Orton explaining his outburst against McMahon was a result of intermittent explosive disorder (IED) and threatened to sue the company and cancel WrestleMania XXV if he was fired, as winning the Rumble guaranteed him a championship match at WrestleMania. Instead he was booked for a no holds barred match with Vince's son, Shane, at No Way Out in February, which Orton won. The night after the event, they fought again until Orton punted Shane unconscious. Stephanie McMahon came to the ring to oversee her brother being carried away by the paramedics and shouted at Orton until he performed an RKO, his finishing move, to her.Triple H ran to the ring and chased away the group, standing over the body of Stephanie McMahon.The next week,Orton and The Legacy attacked Triple H.When Stephanie came out to stop The Legacy,Orton attacked and made out with her before hitting Triple H with a sledgehammer.|$|E
5|$|Women {{typically}} {{began working}} at the mines at around the age of 10 or 11, {{although there are some}} cases of girls starting work at as young as six, and in areas such as Camborne with a high demand for workers it was not unusual for girls to start work at age seven or eight. (Charles Foster Barham's enquiry of 1841 found an average age for starting work of 12.) Until the 1870s Cornwall was largely unaffected by legislation which limited child labour in mines elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and the typical ages of bal maidens remained virtually unchanged between the 1841 census and the 1871 census. Women would typically remain at the mine until they married; while this generally meant that they stopped working at between the ages of 19 and 24, it was not unusual for unmarried women and widows to continue working into their 60s and 70s; and a 93-year-old bal maiden was recorded in the 1891 census. A typical working day would last from 7.00am to 5.00pm in summer and from dawn to dusk in winter, (ore dressing by candle-light was not cost effective) with a lunch break of either half an hour or an hour at noon. Lunch typically consisted of pasties, hoggans (hard pasties made with unleavened barley flour and filled with pork, potato or dried fruit) or fish eaten cold or warmed in ovens attached to the mine's furnaces, along with mugwort or pennyroyal tea, and it was not usual even for workers who lived near their workplace to go home for meals. Although still not paid on a piece-rate basis, each bal maiden would be expected to meet a daily quota to earn her pay; some mines operated on the basis that once the quota had been met the bal maidens were allowed to go home, meaning the working day <b>could</b> <b>finish</b> up to two hours early. Although at a few tin mines at which water-powered machinery was in continuous operation bal maidens would work seven days a week, {{in the vast majority of}} the industry they were not expected to work on Sundays. As well as the religious holidays observed in the rest of the United Kingdom, Cornish miners also celebrated St Piran's Day (5March) and Chewidden Thursday (the Thursday before Christmas), purportedly the day on which St Piran rediscovered tin-smelting. Other than religious holidays and parish feast days, Cornish miners had no holidays until labour reforms in the early 20thcentury.|$|E
