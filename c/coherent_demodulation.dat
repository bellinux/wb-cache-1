Synthesis method of mathematical model <b>coherent</b> <b>demodulation</b> of synchronous mutually nonorthogonal digital signals with minimum frequency-shift keying. Coherent demodulations of powerful signal interference with minimum frequency-shift keying and useful digital signal with minimum frequency-shift keying in a channel with additive white noise are showed. In absence of signal interference this procedure degenerates in classic <b>coherent</b> <b>demodulation</b> of digital signal with minimum frequency-shift keying. When the power of signal interference is much greater power of the useful digital signal with a minimum frequency-shift keying the interference protection receiving in the channel with additive white noise there is such when a signal interference missing. Conclusions. This mathematical model procedure {{can be used in}} modem compensators for realization of the repeated use of frequency resource and in development of perspective protection from signal interference of radio contact facilities. ? ?????? ??????????? ?????? ?????????????? ?????? ??????????????? ????????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????????? ?? ? ???. ??? ?????????? ?????? ?????? ????????? ??????????? ? ????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ?? ? ???. ??? ???????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ??? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ?? ? ??? ?????????????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ?????????????????? ?????? ? ?????? ? ?????????? ????? ??????????? ????? ??? ??????. ?????? ?????????????? ?????? ????? ???? ???????????? ??? ?????????? ???????? ?????????????, ?????????????? ????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????, ? ????? ??? ?????????? ????????????? ???????????????? ??????? ??????????...|$|E
40|$|Impulse radio ultra {{wide band}} (UWB) {{communications}} require robust receivers; typically Rake receivers {{are required to}} capture {{a large number of}} resolvable paths, (even hundred of paths), so large number of correlators are needed; otherwise, adaptive receivers use complex filters and channel estimation algorithms. Therefore, traditional Impulse Radio receivers demand non-practical implementation structures. In this paper we propose a novel correlation-adaptive receiver structure with low complexity for indoor high speed ultra wide band systems. This novel structure combines correlation characteristics from rake receivers with recursive filters from adaptive receivers. The receiver includes a low complexity recursive channel estimation filter capable of estimating hundreds of channel impulse responses, and a single filter-correlation filter used for <b>coherent</b> bit <b>demodulation.</b> Furthermore, we derive by simulations the bit error rate for high density multipath environments for several Impulse Radio modulations like TH-PPM, DS-BPSK and TH-BPSK and we compare the performance of the proposed structure with typical Rake receivers. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{discrete}} {{fading channel}} (DFC) {{consisting of a}} binary modulated time-correlated Rayleigh fading channel {{used in conjunction with}} <b>coherent</b> soft-decision <b>demodulation</b> of resolution q is considered. The capacity of the binary input 2 q-ary output DFC, which can be explicitly expressed in terms of a non-binary noise discrete channel with stationary ergodic 2 q-ary noise, is evaluated in terms of q and the fading parameters. It is observed that considerable capacity gains can be achieved due to the channel’s statistical memory and the use of as few as 2 bits for soft-decision over interleaving the channel (to render it memoryless) and hard-decision demodulation (q = 1). The DFC is next fitted by a recently introduced analytically tractable queue-based (QB) Markovian noise model. The QB parameters are estimated via an iterative procedure that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence rate between the DFC and QB noise sources. Modeling results, measured in terms of both channel noise correlation function and capacity reveal a good agreement between the two channels for a broad range of fading conditions. I...|$|R
40|$|Physical-Layer Network Coding has the {{potential}} to greatly increase the throughput of wireless networks. This novel method of operating networks is based on the <b>coherent</b> <b>demodulation</b> of signals containing two waveforms transmitted synchronously. In this thesis, we explore the problems imposed by the physical constraints, in particular the carrier phase offset of the two signals making up the physical network code (PNC). For QPSK transmissions, <b>coherent</b> <b>demodulation</b> of the resulting symbols will be penalized by a decreased minimum distance resulting from carrier phase misalignment. Based on the observation that binary signalling is not affected by this asynchrony, we propose a modulation framework which enables the <b>coherent</b> <b>demodulation</b> of PNC symbols with arbitrary phase offsets. The framework is based on bit-offset modulation by the sources and Maximum-Likelihood Sequence Detection by the receiver. The spread in receiver performance for a range of phase offset PNC signals is less than 2 dB at moderate SNR for transmissions at a rate of 2 bits/symbol. These results confirm that the proposed solution is able {{to solve the problem of}} phase asynchrony for PNC QPSK and higher order modulations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Relaying and {{cooperative}} diversity allow multiple wireless radios to effectively share their antennas {{and create a}} virtual antenna array, thereby leveraging the spatial diversity benefits of multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems. This paper examines the benefits of cooperative diversity for scenarios in which the receivers cannot exploit accurate channel state information (CSI). In particular, noncoherent demodulation is explored for two classes of relay processing, namely, detectand-forward and amplify-and-forward. A complete maximum likelihood (ML) framework for noncoherent demodulation is developed for detect-and-forward, and is shown to naturally extend the corresponding framework for <b>coherent</b> <b>demodulation.</b> By contrast, the intractability of ML demodulation for noncoherent amplify-and-forward is demonstrated, suggesting a disconnect from the well-developed framework for <b>coherent</b> <b>demodulation.</b> Simulation results exhibit the diversity benefits of the detect-andforward algorithms.

40|$|Abstract—A code {{acquisition}} technique {{based on}} active optical correlation detection is introduced for coherent optical pulse code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems implemented through <b>coherent</b> correlation <b>demodulation.</b> Passive matched filter acquisition, commonplace in most radio CDMA systems, does not translate {{directly into the}} optical domain since synchro-nization between the incoming optical signal and a local optical code of the intended user at the receiver has {{to take place in}} several picosecond duration. Parallel and serial acquisition schemes under the same search algorithm are described and the effect of optical device noise, partial autocorrelation, and multiuser interference on acquisition performance is theoretically analyzed. Numerical results are given for Gold codes. In general, the degree of parallelism inherent in code acquisition techniques for radio systems allows a tradeoff between acquisition speed and hardware cost; however, in optical acquisition schemes, increasing the degree of parallelism with the concomitant hard-ware cost penalty does not necessarily reduce the time to acquisi-tion. This is due to optical power budget limitations brought about by the need to split the optical signal, although optical amplifier technology can improve the performance of these parallel search schemes. The expressions for the partial correlation and multiuser inter-ference derived in the paper can also be utilized for the analysis of other radio and optical acquisition schemes.
