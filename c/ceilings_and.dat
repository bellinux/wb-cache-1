40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Integrated Terminal Weather System (ITWS) is {{supporting}} {{the development of}} weather products important for air traffic control ni the terminal area. These products {{will take advantage of}} new terminal area sensors, including Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR), Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD), and the Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting System (MDCRS). Some of these ITWS products will allow air traffic managers to anticipate significant short-term changes in <b>ceiling</b> <b>and</b> visibility. This report focuses on the scientific data requirements for supporting prototype model-system development and diagnostics. Model diagnostics can include case studies to determine the most important physical processes that were responsible for a particular <b>ceiling</b> <b>and</b> visibility-event, " providing the insight necessary for the development of effective <b>ceiling</b> <b>and</b> visibility product algorithms. In time such case study diagnostics could also include careful off-line "failure analyses " that may affect the design of the operational system. General <b>ceiling</b> <b>and</b> visibility test beds are discussed. Updated reports will be released periodically as the ITWS <b>ceiling</b> <b>and</b> viaibility project proceeds...|$|R

5|$|Mosaics {{are among}} the most {{enduring}} of Roman decorative arts, and are found on the surfaces of floors and other architectural features such as walls, vaulted <b>ceilings,</b> <b>and</b> columns. The most common form is the tessellated mosaic, formed from uniform pieces (tesserae) of materials such as stone and glass. Mosaics were usually crafted on site, but sometimes assembled and shipped as ready-made panels. A mosaic workshop was led by the master artist (pictor) who worked with two grades of assistants.|$|E
5|$|The common {{element to}} both church and palazzi {{interior}} design was the stucco work. Stucco {{is an important}} component of the Baroque design and philosophy, as it seamlessly combines architecture, sculpture, and painting in three-dimensional form. Its combination with trompe l'oeil <b>ceilings</b> <b>and</b> walls in Baroque illusionistic painting confuses reality and art. While in churches the stucco could represent angels and putti linked by swags of flowers, in a private house it might represent the owner's favourite foods or musical instruments.|$|E

Woodlea has 140 rooms, which were designed not to be drafty, and with important rooms not too remote. The rooms are all over-scaled {{in terms of the}} height of the <b>ceilings</b> <b>and</b> size of the doors, with large fireplaces, and the length and breadth of the stairway to the house's second floor. The staircases have recesses with intricate decorative panels.|$|E

5|$|Under the Act, {{regulations}} and rules came into force on 2 December 1802 {{and applied to}} all mills and factories employing three or more apprentices (unless the total workforce was less than twenty). It stated that all mills and factories should be cleaned at least twice yearly with quicklime and water; this included <b>ceilings</b> <b>and</b> walls. There was a requirement that the buildings have sufficient windows and openings for ventilation.|$|E
5|$|Æthelbert rebuilt York Minster, {{which had}} been {{destroyed}} by fire in 741, giving Eanbald and Alcuin the job of overseeing the construction. Alcuin wrote that it had bright windows and <b>ceilings</b> <b>and</b> that the liturgical vessels and altars were decorated with precious metals and gems. The new building also had 30 altars as well as upper apartments. Æthelbert dedicated one of the altars to Saint Paul and it was located on the location where Edwin, the first Christian king of Northumbria, was baptized.|$|E
5|$|Beyond: Two Souls is an {{interactive}} drama action-adventure game, requiring the player {{to move and}} guide the character into interactions with objects and other non-player characters in the scene to progress the story. The player primarily controls Jodie through the in-game environments. At almost any time, however, the player (or second player during a two-player game) can switch to control Aiden instead. Aiden, as an incorporeal entity, exists permanently in noclip mode and can move through walls, <b>ceilings,</b> <b>and</b> other obstacles; however, he is limited to moving only within a certain radius around Jodie due to their spiritual tethering.|$|E

5|$|One {{result was}} a flourishing of Scottish Renaissance painted <b>ceilings</b> <b>and</b> walls in estate houses. These {{included}} detailed coloured patterns and scenes, of which over a hundred examples survive. The designs relied upon continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, as well as elements that called on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory. The earliest example still extant is at the Hamilton palace of Kinneil, West Lothian, decorated in the 1550s for the then regent the James Hamilton, Earl of Arran. Other examples include the ceiling at Prestongrange House, undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle, and the long gallery at Pinkie House, painted for Alexander Seaton, Earl of Dunfermline in 1621.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Baronet who {{was also}} Edward Strachey, a Liberal politician, was {{returned}} to Parliament for Somerset South at the 1892 general election. He served under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and later H. H. Asquith as Treasurer of the Household from 1905 to 1909 and under Asquith as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries from 1909 to 1911. He was raised to the Peerage as Baron Strachie in 1911. During the 1970s major restoration work was undertaken to deal with dry rot and replace wiring {{which resulted in the}} removal of several <b>ceilings</b> <b>and</b> decorations from many of the rooms.|$|E
5|$|The convent, {{which was}} built around 1854, {{was used as the}} central {{residence}} of Jesuit missionaries in Bohol. It was built parallel to the transept and was an unusual three-storey structure, with a two-storey outdoor gallery (called a volada) and thick walls. It is the only convent in the Philippines with three storeys. An extension perpendicular to the convent was built {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. The convent was also adorned with paintings on its walls and <b>ceilings,</b> <b>and</b> with colored glass on its windows and cornices on the kitchen. The roof was replaced with galvanized iron in 1888. The third floor of the convent is now used as an ecclesiastical museum (known as Loboc Museum), containing several religious artifacts, such as a 1786 silver missal and 18th century wooden Santo Niño.|$|E

5|$|The {{governors}} remained {{without an}} official residence until 1919 {{when the state}} purchased a home located at 101 East 27th St., Indianapolis, for $65,000 and furnished it for an additional $20,000. It was built by Henry Kahn in 1908 and had the design of an English country house. The home had a Gothic interior with high, beamed <b>ceilings</b> <b>and</b> luxurious Wilton carpeting. After a brief renovation, the home was inhabited by the governor starting in 1919 and remained so until 1945. The building was sold {{by the state to}} the Marott Hotel, which intended {{to turn it into a}} clubhouse, but eventually demolished it in 1962 to clear land for a parking lot.|$|E
5|$|The loss of ecclesiastical {{patronage}} {{that resulted}} from the Reformation created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of Scottish Renaissance painted <b>ceilings</b> <b>and</b> walls. Other forms of domestic decoration included tapestries and stone and wood carving. In {{the first half of}} the eighteenth century there was an increasing professionalisation and organisation of art. Large numbers of artists took the grand tour to Italy. The Academy of St. Luke was founded as a society for artists in 1729. It included among its members Allan Ramsay, who emerged as one of the most important British artists of the era.|$|E
5|$|These {{top stories}} are very narrow with low, sloped <b>ceilings,</b> <b>and</b> are useful only for holding {{radio-broadcasting}} and other mechanical and electrical equipment. Television station WCBS-TV (Channel 2) originally transmitted {{from the top}} of the Chrysler starting in 1938. The installation continued through the early 1950s, when it moved to the Empire State Building due to competition from RCA's transmitter at the latter tower. For many years, WPAT-FM and WTFM (now WKTU) also used the Chrysler Building as a transmission site, but they also moved to the Empire State Building by the 1970s. Since then, there have not been any commercial broadcast stations located at the Chrysler Building.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} heavy {{emphasis on}} environmental destruction using a procedural destruction system. Players can break structures by planting explosives on them, or shoot walls to make bullet holes. Players may gain tactical advantages through environmental destruction, and the system aims at encouraging players to utilize creativity and strategy. A bullet-penetration system is featured, in which bullets that pass through structures deal less damage to enemies. In addition to destruction, players can also set up heavy-duty fortifications on walls and deployable shields around them for protection; these can be destroyed through breaching or by utilizing operator specific melee-weapons like sledgehammers. In order to stop attackers' advance, defenders can place traps like barbed-wire and explosive laserwire traps around the maps. Vertical space is a key gameplay element in the game's maps: players can destroy <b>ceilings</b> <b>and</b> floors using breach charges and can ambush enemies by rappelling through windows. Powerful weapons like grenades and breach charges are valuable, as only limited numbers {{can be used in}} a round.|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{each level}} {{is to protect}} Baby Mario, who rides on Yoshi's back. If Yoshi is hit by an enemy or obstacle, Baby Mario will float off into a bubble and a timer will start {{counting}} down. If the player fails to recover Baby Mario before the counter reaches zero, Baby Mario will be taken away by Koopas and Yoshi will lose a life. The timer can recover up to ten seconds, and Yoshi can collect stars {{to increase the amount}} of time on the counter. However, if Yoshi falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or comes into contact with spikes or lava, he will automatically lose a life. In some areas, players can collect a Starman that transforms Baby Mario into Super Baby Mario. During these areas, players take control of Baby Mario who, for a short period, is invincible, can run on walls and <b>ceilings,</b> <b>and</b> can float using his cape. Additionally, some areas transform Yoshi into various vehicles, such as a helicopter or digger, allowing him to reach otherwise inaccessible areas for a short amount of time.|$|E
5|$|The loss of ecclesiastical {{patronage}} {{that resulted}} from the Reformation, created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of Scottish Renaissance painted <b>ceilings</b> <b>and</b> walls, {{with large numbers of}} private houses of burgesses, lairds and lords gaining often highly detailed and coloured patterns and scenes, of which over a hundred examples survive. These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, with elements that call on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory.
