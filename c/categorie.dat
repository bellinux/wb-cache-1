5|$|The third {{classification}} was {{the mountains}} classification. Most {{stages of the}} race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and hors <b>catégorie,</b> with the more difficult climbs rated lower. Fourth-category awarded 1 rider with 1 point; third-category awarded 2 riders, the first with 2 points; second-category awarded 4 riders, the first with 5 points; and first-category awarded 6 riders, the first with 10 points; and hors <b>catégorie</b> awarded ten riders, the first with 25 points. Double points were awarded on the summit finishes on stages 1, 11 and 20. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.|$|E
5|$|The third {{classification}} was {{the mountains}} classification. Points were {{awarded to the}} riders that reached {{the summit of the}} most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second-, first-category and hors <b>catégorie,</b> with the more difficult climbs rated lower. In the 2010 Tour, any hors <b>catégorie,</b> first-, or second-category climb awarded double points if it was the last of the stage. In 2011, only the summit stage finishes awarded double points, specifically stages 12, 14, 18 and 19. Pre-race analysis speculated that the winner would be more likely, under this system, to be a general classification contender than in years past. This speculation proved accurate, as Samuel Sánchez, who finished sixth in the general classification, won the mountains classification, and the top three finishers in the general classification were in the top five of the mountains classification. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.|$|E
5|$|Stage 11 of the 2012 Tour de France was contested on 12 July and {{the race}} {{concluded}} with Stage 20 on 22 July. The {{second half of the}} race was situated entirely within France; starting with a mountain stage from Albertville to La Toussuire-Les Sybelles – incorporating two hors <b>catégorie</b> climbs during the stage – before the customary race-concluding stage finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The third {{classification}} was {{the mountains}} classification. Points were {{awarded to the}} riders that reached {{the summit of the}} most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and hors <b>catégorie,</b> with the more difficult climbs rated lower. Double points were awarded on the summit finishes on stages 9, 12, 17 and 19. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, the riders {{were faced with}} the Giro's longest stage, with {{numerous}} high mountain climbs along the course and {{the distinction of being}} the race's queen stage. It was originally scheduled to include the Col d'Izoard, which has been featured numerous times in the Tour de France as an Hors <b>Categorie</b> climb. Race officials later decided to alter the course, staying on the Italian side of the Alps, believing the stretches that were to take place in France were too remote and that radio communication in the area could not be assured. The course as it originally was designed mimicked exactly a course used in the 1949 Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification, the leadership of which was marked by a red and white polka-dot jersey. In the mountains classification, points were won by reaching {{the top of a}} climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorised as either hors, first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. Hors <b>catégorie</b> climbs awarded the most points, with 20points on offer for the first rider across the summit; the first ten riders were able to accrue points towards the mountains classification, compared with the first eight on first-category passes and the first six riders on second-category climbs. Fewer points were on offer for the smaller hills, marked as third-category or fourth-category.|$|E
25|$|This was a {{mountain}} stage with four categorized climbs: the Col du Galibier (Hors <b>categorie)</b> with a 4.5% ascent over 42.8km, the Col de la Croix-de-Fer (Hors <b>categorie)</b> with a 6.9% ascent over 22.7km, the Col du Mollard (Category 2) with a 6.8% ascent over 5.8km, and La Toussuire (Category 1) with an ascent of 6% over 18.4km. It began at Bourg-d'Oisans and ended at La Toussuire.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification. The organisation had categorized some climbs as either hors <b>catégorie,</b> first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that {{reached the top of}} these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a polkadot jersey.|$|E
25|$|The third {{classification}} was {{the mountains}} classification. Points were {{awarded to the}} riders that reached {{the summit of the}} most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorized, in order of increasing difficulty, as fourth-, third-, second-, and first-category and hors <b>catégorie.</b> Double points were awarded on the summit finish of the Col d'Izoard on stage 18. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.|$|E
25|$|Similarly {{the split}} {{categories}} over E form a 2-category Scin(E) (from French <b>catégorie</b> scindée), where {{the category of}} morphisms between two split categories F and G is the full sub-category ScinE(F,G) of E-functors from F to G consisting of those functors that transform each transport morphism of F into a transport morphism of G. Each such morphism of split E-categories is also a morphism of E-fibred categories, i.e., ScinE(F,G) ⊂ CartE(F,G).|$|E
25|$|Stage 11 is a {{mountain}} stage with five categorized climbs: the Col du Tourmalet (Hors <b>catégorie)</b> with an ascent of 7.7% over 18.4km, the Col d'Aspin (Category 1) with an ascent of 5.2% over 12.3km, the Col de Peyresourde (Category 1) with an ascent of 7.1% over 9.5km, the Col du Portillon (Category 1) with an ascent of 8.4% over 7.9km, and the Pla-de-Beret (Category 1 in Spain) with an ascent of 5.4% over 13.5km. It begins at Tarbes at 325 m and ends at Val d'Aran at 1830 m.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} awarded no {{jersey to}} the leader until the 1975 Tour de France, when the organizers decided to award a distinctive white jersey with red dots {{to the leader}}. The climbers' jersey is worn by the rider who, {{at the start of}} each stage, has the largest number of climbing points. If a rider leads two or more of classifications, the climbers' jersey is worn by the rider in second, or third, place in that contest. At the end of the Tour, the rider holding the most climbing points wins the classification. Some riders may race with the aim of winning this particular competition, while others who gain points early on may shift their focus to the classification during the race. The Tour has five categories for ranking the mountains the race covers. The scale ranges from category 4, the easiest, to hors <b>catégorie,</b> the hardest. During his career Richard Virenque won the mountains classification a record seven times.|$|E
25|$|On 16 December 2011, it was {{revealed}} that Feyenoord had been placed in the more favorable second category (<b>Categorie</b> 2). Meaning that Feyenoord were no longer in debt according to the KNVB. They have earned this by the transfer of significant players and a large capital injection made by the organisation VVF (Friends of Feyenoord, Vrienden Van Feyenoord). However to stay in the second category, Feyenoord needed to obtain the same amount of points earned rounding up to or higher than 65 points. On 13 April 2012 Feyenoord was officially out of what has been described as the 'financial dangerzone' and was officially placed in the second Category. According to chairman of the club Eric Gudde the placing in the more favourable category came earlier than anticipated, he also congratulated the fans and promised to maintain the same policy until Feyenoord was completely healthy again and will never fall back into the 1st Category.|$|E
500|$|The {{final day}} in the {{mountains}} saw the race cross the first-category Col de Menté and the second-category Col des Ares before reaching the last hors <b>catégorie</b> climb of the Tour, the Port de Balès. The race then dropped down, before returning over the [...] uncategorised Col de Peyresourde – crossing the summit {{for the second consecutive}} day – followed by a summit finish at the Peyragudes ski resort. With a scheduled parcours of , the stage was the shortest of the mountain stages of the 2012 Tour.|$|E
500|$|After a rest day, the Tour {{remained}} in the Jura Mountains, {{with much of the}} day's route the same as that followed on stage five of the 2012 Critérium du Dauphiné, including the Tour's first passage over the hors <b>catégorie</b> climb of the Col du Grand Colombier; a [...] long climb, reaching an altitude of [...] at an average gradient of 7.1%, but with sections in excess of 12%. The Tour then passed over the [...] Col de Richemond, [...] before the finish; the race descended towards Billiat before a gradual uphill finish in Bellegarde-sur-Valserine.|$|E
500|$|After {{the second}} and final rest day, the race entered the high {{mountains}} with the queen stage crossing two hors <b>catégorie</b> climbs – the Col d'Aubisque and the Col du Tourmalet – followed by the first-category climbs of the Col d'Aspin and the Col de Peyresourde, completing the so-called [...] "Circle of Death", before dropping down to the finish in Bagnères-de-Luchon. The first rider over the Tourmalet – the highest point reached in both the Pyrenees and the 2012 Tour as a whole at [...] – received the Souvenir Jacques Goddet.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} of the three stages in the Pyrenees, the sixteenth, a {{breakaway}} group of 21 riders formed [...] in. The group reduced to five after the final climb, the hors <b>catégorie</b> Port de Balès with [...] remaining, out of which came the winner, Michael Rogers of (...) , who attacked [...] from finish in Bagnères-de-Luchon. The group of general classification favourites came in over eight minutes down. Majka led the mountains classification. The Tour's queen stage, the seventeenth, featured three first-category climbs and the hors <b>catégorie</b> climb to the finish at Saint-Lary Pla d’Adet. An early nine-strong breakaway was pulled back before the first climb by [...] for their rider Rodríguez to take the mountains classification points and the temporary lead of the competition. This {{led to the formation of}} a large lead group which gradually split across the middle climbs. Rodriguez and Majka led the lead group race over the penultimate climb, with the former first. On the final climb, a group of four that had escaped were caught by Majka, who had dropped Rodríguez, and he soloed to claim his second stage win and the large amount of points for the summit finish. Nibali had split apart the group of chasing overall favourites and came in third. Second-placed overall Valverde lost a minute to Thibaut Pinot in third.|$|E
500|$|The overall standings did {{not change}} until stage 12, on Bastille Day, which ended with the hors <b>catégorie</b> climb to Luz Ardiden. Voeckler {{finished}} ninth on the day, ceding 20 seconds {{to most of the}} race's top overall riders, but still had sufficient time in hand to remain race leader by nearly two minutes. Rolland finished at his side for tenth on the day. Voeckler had said the night before that he expected to lose the jersey on this stage. After the peloton mostly stayed together in stage 13, popular expectation for stage 14, including two first-category climbs on course and another hors <b>catégorie</b> climb at the finish (Plateau de Beille), again was for Voeckler to lose the jersey. But he not only retained the jersey, he also finished with the main group of overall favorites, losing time to only three riders and actually putting time into other riders such as Damiano Cunego and Tom Danielson. Voeckler himself again expressed his surprise at his successes, saying [...] "I was very surprised to be with the best riders up the Plateau de Beille climb. I don't know how far I can go." [...] Stage 16 ended with a lengthy descent, from the second-category Col de Manse. Voeckler lost time to nearly all the race's top riders, and expressed after the stage his certainty that he could not win the Tour, but he remained race leader.|$|E
500|$|In {{the sixteenth}} stage, the race entered the high {{mountains}} with the queen stage crossing two hors <b>catégorie</b> climbs– the Col d'Aubisque and the Col du Tourmalet– {{followed by the}} first-category climbs of the Col d'Aspin and the Col de Peyresourde, completing the so-called [...] "Circle of Death". A 38-rider breakaway crossed the Aubisque, before fracturing on the Tourmalet. Voeckler attacked on the Peyresourde and took the stage win with a margin of one minute and forty seconds. Voeckler's stage victory and maximum points over all summits {{put him in the}} lead of the mountains classification. Wiggins, Froome and Nibali came in seven minutes after Voeckler, while Evans lost almost five minutes to the trio, falling from fourth to seventh in the general classification. In the final stage in the Pyrenees, the seventeenth, after a number of attacks on the leading group containing the overall contenders, Alejandro Valverde moved clear over the hors <b>categorie</b> Port de Balès. He held his lead to the summit finish at the Peyragudes ski resort. In the group behind, Wiggins and Froome attacked their rivals to finish nineteen seconds later. Nibali came in seventh, a further eighteen seconds down. In the following stage, six riders from a breakaway were caught on the finishing straight in Brive-la-Gaillarde by the head of the chasing peloton, with Cavendish taking the victory ahead of Matthew Goss and Sagan respectively. Wiggins secured the general classification in the penultimate stage's [...] individual time trial. Froome placed second, one minute and sixteen seconds in arrears, with Sánchez a further 34 seconds behind in third.|$|E
500|$|Stages ten {{and eleven}} {{ended with a}} bunch sprints, with the victors André Greipel and Cavendish, respectively. The latter took {{the lead of the}} points classification. Stage twelve was the first to enter the high mountains, and {{included}} two climbs that were rated hors <b>catégorie,</b> the La Hourquette d'Ancizan and the climb to the finish at Luz Ardiden. An early breakaway of six riders were caught and passed in the final [...] by Jelle Vanendert (...) and Samuel Sánchez). They held off the chasing group that included the main general classification contenders and a late attack by Fränk Schleck, with Samuel Sánchez crossing the finish line first. Of the general classification favourites, Contador lost the most time in the stage, 33 seconds down on third-placed Fränk Schleck (the highest placed overall contender). The mountains classification points Samuel Sánchez received at the summit finish put him in the polka dot jersey. In the thirteenth stage, a three-rider breakaway went clear over the hors catégorie-rated Col d'Aubisque, and after the long descent to Lourdes, they finished with a margin of five minutes; Hushovd took the stage win. Jérémy Roy (...) , {{who was one of the}} three, took the polka. The fourteenth stage was last in the Pyrenees and it included six categorised climbs. As the race reached the hors <b>catégorie</b> climb to Plateau de Beille and the finish, the main group of overall favourites took control, and with [...] to go, Vanendert attacked and won with a margin of 21 seconds. His win put Vanendert in the polka.|$|E
500|$|The queen {{stage of}} the 2012 Dauphiné, the {{penultimate}} stage consisted of six categorised climbs during its [...] parcours, {{the first of which}} coming after only [...] with the first-category Col de Plainpalais. After a pair of third-category passes, the field tackled another first-category climb, the Col de la Colombière coming with [...] remaining of the stage. Inside the final , the day's two remaining climbs were ascented; the third-category Côte de Châtillon, and the race's second and final hors <b>catégorie</b> climb, with the Col de Joux Plane– reaching an altitude of – being the start of the run-in towards Morzine, with the summit of the climb coming with [...] to go of the stage.|$|E
500|$|The {{stage was}} spent {{entirely in the}} Alps with two hors <b>catégorie</b> climbs – the Col de la Madeleine after [...] and the Col de la Croix de Fer after both of which had summits at [...] or higher – before the finish at La Toussuire-Les Sybelles. The Col de la Croix de Fer was the highest point reached in the Alps in the 2012 Tour, so the leader across the summit would win the Souvenir Henri Desgrange. The finish was a first-category climb of [...] at an average {{gradient}} of 6.1%. Much like the previous day, a large breakaway was formed after several different groups advanced clear of the main field {{as they approached the}} first climb of the day, at the Col de la Madeleine.|$|E
500|$|There were 21 {{stages in}} the race, {{covering}} a total distance of , [...] longer than the 2015 Tour.

500|$|There were 21 {{stages in}} the race, {{covering}} a total of , [...] shorter than the 2012 Tour. The longest mass-start stage was the fourth at , and stage 20 was the shortest at [...] Eight stages were officially classified as flat, three medium mountain, seven high mountain, two individual time trial and one team time trial. There were four summit finishes: stage 8, to Ax 3 Domaines; stage 15, to Mont Ventoux; stage 18, to Alpe d'Huez; and stage 20, to Semnoz; The highest point of the race was the -high Port de Pailhères mountain pass on stage eight. It was among seven hors <b>catégorie</b> (English: beyond category) rated climbs in the race. The final stage ending on the Champs-Élysées was an evening finish for the first time. There were ten new stage start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage 9, in Saint-Nazaire, and 15, in Vaucluse.|$|E
500|$|The fifth {{stage was}} the first to be {{categorised}} as a mountain stage, with a summit finish at the ski resort of Valmorel, just outside Les Avanchers. After an opening loop around the start town of Grésy-sur-Aix, the Côte de Trévignin {{was the first}} of four categorised climbs on the day's route. The climb of [...] averaged 6.6% over the ascent, and from there the race progressed to the Massif des Bauges. After a period of undulating terrain, the short, sharp fourth-category Col du Frêne was next on the route, at 6% over just under [...] of climbing. After the descent down to Saint-Pierre-d'Albigny, the [...] parcours headed towards Valmorel via Albertville, the intermediate sprint point at La Bâthie and the fourth-category Côte de la Croix. The final climb, an hors <b>catégorie</b> ascent, averaged 7% over , which was somewhat ameliorated by several hairpin bends towards the finish, which provided any attacking rider with a perfect kick towards the finish.|$|E
500|$|The queen {{stage of}} the 2013 Critérium du Dauphiné, the {{penultimate}} stage steadily rose out of the start town in Le Pont-de-Claix towards {{the first of the}} day's five categorised climbs. The first test, a climb to Alpe d'Huez, was seen as a dress rehearsal for the Tour de France, to be held in July, with the , 8.6% average hors <b>catégorie</b> climb featuring twice on that race's eighteenth stage. From there, it was a short descent to the second climb, the second-category Col de Sarenne, which averaged almost 7% over [...] of climbing. An immediate long descent followed, before the first-category Col d'Ornon, which averaged 6.1% over its [...] duration. The riders enjoyed a respite from the climbs for around an hour across the Valbonnais, passing through the intermediate sprint at Corps. The final portion of the [...] parcours saw the riders climb the Col du Noyer, with portions at 11%, before a descent and a , 5.7% kick up to the finish at SuperDévoluy.|$|E
500|$|There were 21 {{stages in}} the race, {{covering}} a total distance of , [...] shorter than the 2011 Tour. The longest mass-start stage was the twelfth at , and stage 21 was the shortest at [...] The race featured twice the time trialling distance of the previous Tour, a total of , with the prologue, stage nine and stage nineteen. Of the remaining stages, nine were officially classified as flat, four as medium mountain and five as high mountain. There were three summit finishes: stage 7, to La Planche des Belles Filles; stage 11, to La Toussuire-Les Sybelles; and stage 17, to Peyragudes. The Col du Grand Colombier, in the Alps, was included for the first time, and was among six hors <b>catégorie</b> (English: beyond category) rated climbs in the race. The highest point of the race was the -high Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage sixteen. There were nine new stage start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage nine, in Mâcon, and fifteen, in Pau.|$|E
500|$|The {{first of}} three mountainous stages to {{conclude}} the Dauphiné, the fifth stage of the race {{was seen as a}} precursor to the tenth stage of July's Tour de France, with the majority of the day's route making up the parcours of that stage to be held on 11 July. Three categorised climbs were part of the [...] parcours of the day, notably the hors <b>catégorie</b> Le Grand Colombier– making its début in the race– with an average gradient of 6.9%, reaching up to an altitude of , but the summit of the final climb– the Col de Richemond– came with [...] remaining of the stage. Mini-attacks set the course of the early running of the stage, which was carried out a quick pace, with the peloton covering [...] in the first hour of racing. After [...] rider Blel Kadri escaped out of the peloton to take the honours at the first summit of the day, the Côte de Corlier, {{it was not until the}} uncategorised Col de la Berche several kilometres later that a group of riders managed to get clear.|$|E
500|$|Voeckler {{crossed the}} summit of the climb first, taking the 25 points on offer for the hors <b>catégorie</b> climb. The peloton crossed five-and-a-half minutes later. Voeckler also took maximum points at the Col de Richemond, and as a result, took the polka-dot jersey for the {{mountains}} classification lead from [...] rider Fredrik Kessiakoff. Sagan had dropped back to aid his teammate Vincenzo Nibali, who had attacked on the descent of the Col du Grand Colombier, but both riders were not to stay in front ahead of the -led peloton. 's Jens Voigt made up a minute on the lead quartet to join them, with around [...] remaining; Devenyns looked to go clear in the closing stages, but Voeckler had kept most in hand to take his third career Tour stage victory, three seconds ahead of Scarponi and seven ahead of Voigt. Wiggins remained on the wheel of his closest rival, Cadel Evans of the , to maintain his 1' 53" [...] lead in the general classification into the Alps.|$|E
500|$|Stage 18 was {{undoubtedly}} {{the most difficult}} in the Tour, incorporating three hors <b>catégorie</b> climbs, including the Col du Galibier at the finish; as such, race organisers defined the stage as the race's queen stage. When Andy Schleck, who began the day two minutes and 36 seconds behind Voeckler, surged away from the race's top riders [...] from the finish and quickly {{made it to the}} morning breakaway, it seemed all but certain that he would become the new race leader. While Schleck easily won the stage, Voeckler followed Evans as the Australian made a strenuous pull {{at the end of the}} stage to limit his time losses. At the very end, Voeckler lost Evans' wheel and fell to fifth on the day, two minutes and 21 seconds behind Schleck. Visibly so spent that he could not sit upright on his bicycle after crossing the finish line, Voeckler had retained the yellow jersey by a margin of 15 seconds. He said afterwards that while he had expected to lose the jersey earlier in the Tour, on this day all the team's efforts were put into retaining it. Post-race analyses called Voeckler a [...] "survivor" [...] and [...] "astonishing." ...|$|E
500|$|Stage eleven's rolling terrain {{resulted}} in a final peloton that included mainly puncheurs; Gallopin won the stage after an attack [...] from the finish in Oyonnax split the peloton and a second with [...] remaining that successfully held off the chasers. The twelfth stage was won by Alexander Kristoff from a bunch sprint. Nibali took the stage win the following stage, making his move from the leading group in the final [...] on the hors <b>catégorie</b> climb to Chamrousse. He extended his lead over the second-placed overall rider Alejandro Valverde to 3 min 37 s. Richie Porte, who was second overall before the stage and the new leader of , lost around nine minutes and dropped to sixteenth. Nibali took {{the lead of the}} mountains classification. In stage fourteen, Rafał Majka (...) attacked from a reduced breakaway on the climb to the finish in Risoul with [...] remaining and managed to hold off chasing the group of overall favourites and soloed to victory. Nibali, third in the stage, extended his lead further by one minute as Valverde lost time and Rodríguez regained the polka dot jersey. Kristoff won the bunch sprint in the transitional stage fifteen.|$|E
500|$|Stage 12, the Bastille Day stage, was {{the first}} {{particularly}} difficult mountain stage in this Tour. It ended at the hors <b>catégorie</b> climb Luz Ardiden, and also visited the hors <b>catégorie</b> Col du Tourmalet and a never-before-seen first category climb La Hourquette d'Ancizan. Sánchez effectively stayed with the group of overall favorites throughout the day, and attacked with 's Jelle Vanendert {{on the way up}} to Luz Ardiden, surpassing the morning breakaway. Starting his sprint for the finish line from [...] out, Sánchez won so convincingly that he opened up a 7-second time gap on Vanendert. It was Sánchez' first Tour stage win of his career and just the third in the team's history [...] one of them had come from former rider Roberto Laiseka on this very mountain in the 2001 Tour de France. Given the new points system for the mountains classification, Sánchez took the polka-dot jersey as mountains leader due to this win, even though he had not previously scored a single point. The result also installed him into the top ten overall for the first time, as he occupied eighth place. The next day, by winning the Col d'Aubisque climb, Jérémy Roy took the mountains classification lead from Sánchez. In stage 14, the overall favorites chased down a breakaway {{on the way to the}} Plateau de Beille summit finish. Once they occupied first position on the road, Andy Schleck tried numerous times to escape but was unable. Vanendert went, and no one but Sánchez put in any serious attempt to chase him down. Vanendert won the stage, and took the mountains classification lead, with Sánchez finishing second, exactly reversing their fates from stage 12. Sánchez also improved to sixth overall with this result. Sánchez improved further in stage 16. While previous race leader Thor Hushovd won the stage from a breakaway, Sánchez, as well as Cadel Evans and Alberto Contador, took time out of some of the race's other top riders by riding away from them on the descent to the finish. Evans was three seconds the better of Sánchez and Contador, who were in turn 18 seconds faster than race leader Thomas Voeckler, Fränk Schleck, Damiano Cunego, and others. They were also 51 seconds the better of Ivan Basso and more than a minute better than Andy Schleck. This result moved Sánchez up to fifth place. Sánchez lost time on stage 18 on the Col du Galibier, finishing 18th almost five minutes behind stage winner Andy Schleck and between one and three minutes behind the race's other top riders. He fell back to eighth because of this.|$|E
500|$|The tenth {{stage was}} the first {{classified}} as mountainous. The Col du Grand Colombier broke apart a 25-rider breakaway, leaving a small group to contest the finish at Bellegarde-sur-Valserine; Thomas Voeckler (...) claimed the stage win and the polka dot jersey. Another mountain stage followed the next day, which again saw a large breakaway. The break crossed the two hors <b>catégorie</b> climbs– the Col de la Madeleine and the Col de la Croix de Fer– before being caught by the chasing group, which contained the overall contenders. A number of attacks followed, until 's Pierre Rolland escaped with [...] to go and took the win at the Les Sybelles ski resort. The group of overall contenders followed 55 seconds later. Evans {{was not in the}} leading contenders group and, due to the time lost, he dropped from second to fourth overall, over three minutes in arrears. Kessiakoff took back the lead of the mountains classification. In stage twelve, a large breakaway formed [...] in, before later reducing to five riders across the Col du Granier. They stayed together until the finish, where, with a kilometer remaining, David Millar (...) escaped to take victory, closely followed by Jean-Christophe Péraud (...) [...] The next stage finished with a bunch sprint won by Greipel, with Sagan second.|$|E
500|$|There were 21 {{stages in}} the race, {{covering}} a total distance of , [...] shorter than the 2010 Tour. For {{only the second time}} since the 1967 Tour, the race started with a mass-start stage instead of a prologue (an individual time trial under [...] ), the last occasion being in 2008. The longest mass-start stage was the seventh at , and stage 21 was the shortest at [...] The race featured only [...] of time trialling, with stage two's team time trial and stage twenty's individual time trial. Of the remaining stages, ten were officially classified as flat, three as medium mountain and six as high mountain. There were four summit finishes: stage 12, to Luz Ardiden; stage 14, to Plateau de Beille; stage 18, to Col du Galibier-Serre Chevalier; and stage 19, to Alpe d'Huez. It was the first time a stage had finished on the -high Galibier. It was the highest summit finish in Tour history, beating the finish of the -high Col du Granon during the 1986 Tour. The highest point of the race was the -high Col Agnel mountain pass on stage 18. It was among nine hors <b>catégorie</b> (English: beyond category) rated climbs in the race. There were fifteen new stage start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage 9, at the Le Lioran mountain resort, and after 15, in the department of Drôme.|$|E
500|$|With Voeckler having visibly {{given it}} {{everything}} he had in stage 18, and another hors <b>catégorie</b> finish looming (at Alpe d'Huez) in stage 19, {{he was no longer}} the favourite to keep the yellow jersey to Paris, as Evans and the Schleck brothers held an advantage over him in the high mountain stages. Though stage 19 was also the Tour's shortest, Voeckler was indeed dropped between the Col du Galibier (visited again in stage 19) and Alpe d'Huez, finally ceding the jersey to Schleck. However, the day was still a very good one for the team. On the ascent of the Galibier, Voeckler told Rolland not to work for him any further and to ride his own race, and Rolland rode at or near the front of the race the rest of the day. Together with Spaniards Alberto Contador and Samuel Sánchez as the leading group on Alpe d'Huez, Rolland rode away from them with [...] to race and took the day's honors, the first and only stage win for a French rider in this Tour. He also claimed the best young rider white jersey by finishing two minutes the better of ' Rein Taaramäe, who had begun the day in the lead in that classification. Voeckler finished 20th on the stage, losing three minutes to most of the other top riders, but this dropped him only to fourth place overall.|$|E
