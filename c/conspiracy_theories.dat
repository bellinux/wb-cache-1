5|$|Skeptics of New World Order <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> accuse {{its proponents}} of indulging in the furtive fallacy, {{a belief that}} {{significant}} facts of history are necessarily sinister; conspiracism, a world view that centrally places <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> in the unfolding of history, rather than social and economic forces; and fusion paranoia, a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever.|$|E

5000|$|Clare Birchall at King's College London {{describes}} <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> as a [...] "form {{of popular}} knowledge or interpretation". The {{use of the}} word 'knowledge' here suggests ways in which <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> may be considered in relation to legitimate modes of knowing. The relationship between legitimate and illegitimate knowledge, Birchall claims, is closer than common dismissals of <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> contend.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{doctoral}} project is to explore the epistemic issues surrounding {{the concept of the}} <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> and to advance the analysis and evaluation of the <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> as a mode of explanation. The candidate is interested in the circumstances under which inferring to the truth or likeliness of a given <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> is, or is not, warranted...|$|R
40|$|Two studies {{examined}} {{correlates of}} belief in a Jewish <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> among Malays in Malaysia, {{a culture in which}} state-directed conspiracism as a means of dealing with perceived external and internal threats is widespread. In Study 1, 368 participants from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, completed a novel measure {{of belief in}} a Jewish <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory,</b> along with measures of general conspiracist ideation and anomie. Initial analysis showed that the novel scale factorially reduced to a single dimension. Further analysis showed that belief in the Jewish <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> was only significantly associated with general conspiracist ideation, but the strength of the association was weak. In Study 2, 314 participants completed the measure of belief in the Jewish <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory,</b> along with measures of general conspiracist ideation and ideological attitudes. Results showed that belief in the Jewish <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> was associated with anti-Israeli attitudes, modern racism directed at Chinese, right-wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation. General conspiracist ideation did not emerge as a significant predictor once other variables had been accounted for. These results suggest that there may be specific cultural and social psychological forces that drive belief in the Jewish <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> within the Malaysian context. Specifically, belief in the Jewish <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> among Malaysian Malays appears to serve ideological needs and as a mask for anti-Chinese sentiment, which may in turn reaffirm their perceived ability to shape socio-political processes...|$|R
5|$|It {{has never}} been fully {{explained}} what motivated the attack: the gunmen {{claimed to have been}} acting on their own initiative, and despite abundant <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories,</b> no convincing evidence surfaced to suggest that any political leader or party was behind the attack. Nevertheless, the killings left a leadership void in the political establishment. <b>Conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> immediately flourished that the gunmen had been acting on orders to sabotage a Karabakh peace deal, but a decade on, the available evidence still pointed to the leading gunman being a loner with a grudge against the Armenian political elite.|$|E

5|$|There {{are those}} who, despite {{evidence}} to the contrary, deny that the moon landings took place. The Apollo moon landing hoax claims helped propel <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> into a quasi-political narrative.|$|E
50|$|Various {{versions}} of the chemtrail <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> have been propagated via the Internet and radio programs. There are websites dedicated to the <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory,</b> and it is particularly favored by right-wing groups because it fits well with deep suspicion of government.|$|R
50|$|The reddit {{group was}} {{additionally}} involved in promoting another falsehood, the Seth Rich murder <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory,</b> with several members planning a march on Washington D.C..

50|$|The Black Knight {{satellite}} <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> {{claims that}} there is a spacecraft in near-polar orbit of the Earth that is of extraterrestrial origin, and that NASA is engaged in a cover-up regarding its existence and origin. This <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> combines several unrelated stories into one narrative.|$|R
5|$|As {{with his}} brother John's death, Kennedy's {{assassination}} and the circumstances surrounding it have spawned a variety of <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories.</b> Kennedy and Huey Long (in 1935) {{are the only two}} sitting United States Senators to be assassinated.|$|E
5|$|Freemasonry has {{attracted}} criticism from theocratic states and organised religions for supposed competition with religion, or supposed heterodoxy within the fraternity itself, and {{has long been}} the target of <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories,</b> which assert Freemasonry to be an occult and evil power.|$|E

5|$|The {{shooting}} led {{to significant}} changes in the country's political landscape. It remains a subject of numerous <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories,</b> mostly involving President Kocharyan, whose tenure thereafter was frequently criticized as authoritarian. Sargsyan and Demirchyan were posthumously honored with National Hero of Armenia titles.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} 1990s, New World Order conspiracism {{was limited to}} two American countercultures, {{primarily}} the militantly anti-government right and secondarily that part of fundamentalist Christianity concerned with the end-time emergence of the Antichrist. Skeptics such as Michael Barkun and Chip Berlet observed that right-wing populist <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> about a New World Order had not only been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but had seeped into popular culture, thereby inaugurating a period during the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the United States where people are actively preparing for apocalyptic millenarian scenarios. Those political scientists are concerned that mass hysteria over New World Order <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> could eventually have devastating effects on American political life, ranging from escalating lone-wolf terrorism to the rise to power of authoritarian ultranationalist demagogues.|$|E
5|$|Fictional {{portrayals of}} Walsingham tend to follow Catholic interpretations, {{depicting}} him as sinister and Machiavellian. He features in <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> surrounding {{the death of}} Christopher Marlowe, whom he predeceased. Charles Nicholl examined (and rejected) such theories in The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe (1992), which {{was used as a}} source by Anthony Burgess for his novel A Dead Man in Deptford (1993).|$|E

5|$|Icke {{combines}} New Age philosophical {{discussion about}} the universe and consciousness with <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> about public figures being reptilian humanoids and paedophiles. He argues in favour of reincarnation; a collective consciousness that has intentionality; modal realism (that other possible worlds exist alongside ours); and the law of attraction (that good and bad thoughts can attract experiences).|$|E
5|$|Inconsistencies in the {{official}} accounts of Scott's death have been cited in <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories,</b> which suggest that Scott died of a heroin overdose, or was killed by exhaust fumes redirected into the car, or that Kinnear did not exist.

5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the head has long been debated, and has resulted in several scientific analyses. The most notable and detailed of these was Karl Pearson and Geoffrey Morant's study conducted in the 1930s, which concluded that the Wilkinson head was that of Cromwell. Rumours and <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> have circulated since Cromwell's head fell from Westminster Hall.|$|E

5|$|A {{debate on}} whether the {{military}} photos {{should or should not}} be released to the public has taken place. Those supporting the release argued that the photos should be considered public records, that the photos are necessary to complete the journalistic record, and that the photos would prove bin Laden's death and therefore prevent <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> that bin Laden is still alive. Those in opposition to a release of the photos expressed concern that the photos would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the film}} was not a major success, former Research Fellow at Australia's National Film & Sound Archive Robert Cettl, in his 2009 book Terrorism in American cinema: an {{analytical}} filmography, 1960–2008 argues that the film reveals an alarmingly realist insight into US-Middle Eastern politics and terrorism since the 2000s, dealing with an al-Qaeda-esque terrorist organization and the <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> that some believe the US government is using the Middle East as a cover-up.|$|E
5|$|American {{televangelist}} Pat Robertson, {{with his}} 1991 best-selling book The New World Order, {{became the most}} prominent Christian popularizer of <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> about recent American history. He describes a scenario where Wall Street, the Federal Reserve System, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission control the flow of events from behind the scenes, nudging people constantly and covertly {{in the direction of}} world government for the Antichrist.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} aims to {{understand}} victim blaming of Ahmadiyya group by majority Sunni Islam in Indonesia. We included ingroup essentialisation, outgroup essentialisation, identity undermining {{and belief in}} <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> as predictors of victim blaming. Results of a survey among 147 Muslims majority Sunni Islam shows {{that the relationship between}} identity undermining and victim blaming is stronger for individuals holding ingroup de-essentialisation compared to those with ingroup essentialisation. Moreover, belief in <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> was found to mediate the effect of the interaction variable of identity undermining and ingroup essentialisation on victim blaming. In addition, outgroup essentialisation was found correlated with belief in <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> but did not play a significant role to moderate the effect of identity undermining on belief in <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> and victim blaming. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. Conspiracy theory; essentialism; identity undermining; victim blamin...|$|R
