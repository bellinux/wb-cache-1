40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the creation of}} an arbitrary κ-discontinuity of the Josephson phase in a long Nb-AlO_x-Nb Josephson junction (LJJ) using a pair of tiny current injectors, and study the formation of fractional vortices formed at this discontinuity. The current I_inj, flowing from one injector to the other, creates a phase discontinuity kappa I_inj. The <b>calibration</b> <b>of</b> <b>injectors</b> is discussed in detail. The small but finite size of injectors leads to some deviations of the properties of such a 0 -kappa-LJJ from the properties of a LJJ with an ideal kappa-discontinuity. These experimentally observed deviations in the dependence of the critical current on I_inj and magnetic field can be well reproduced by numerical simulation assuming a finite injector size. The physical origin of these deviations is discussed. Comment: Submitted to Phys. Rev.

40|$|The {{complete}} {{or partial}} deployment of liquid samples in low gravity is primarily {{influenced by the}} interfacial properties of the specific liquid and solid materials used because the overwhelming bias of the Earth gravitational acceleration is removed. This study addresses the engineering aspects of injecting and deploying drops of prescribed volume into an acoustic positioning chamber in microgravity. The specific problems of interest are the design, testing, and implementation <b>of</b> <b>injector</b> tips {{to be used in}} a simultaneously retracting dual-injector system in the Drop Physics Module microgravity experiment facility. Prior to release, the liquid to be deployed must be retained within a restricted area at the very end <b>of</b> the <b>injectors</b> under dynamic stimuli from the continuous injection flow {{as well as from the}} stepped motion <b>of</b> the <b>injectors.</b> The final released drop must have a well determined volume and negligible residual linear or angular momentum. The outcome of Earth-based short-duration low gravity experiments had been the selection of two types <b>of</b> <b>injector</b> tips which were flown as back-up parts. They were successfully utilized during the USML- 1 Spacelab mission as the primary tips. The combination of a larger contact surface, liquid pinning with a sharp edge, and selective coating of strategic tip surfaces with a non-wetting compound has allowed a significant increase in the success rate of deployment of simple and compound drops of aqueous solutions of glycerol and silicone oil. The diameter of the samples studied in the Drop Physics Module range between 0. 3 and 2. 7 cm. The tests conducted on-orbit with a manually operated small device have allowed the <b>calibration</b> <b>of</b> the volume deployed for a few drop sizes.

40|$|In liquid {{propellant}} engines, the propellants (fuel and oxidizer) after passing the injectors, are injected to combustion chamber. Generally, in {{liquid propellant}} engines, two types <b>of</b> <b>injectors</b> - direct flow and centrifugal flow - are used. The direct flow injector, actuates as an orifice. The input flow to a centrifugal injector, gets the angular momentum and goes out conically. The angular momentum causes the powdering of output fluid. The injecting cones collide {{to each other}} and the mixing operation is accomplished. The mixing and powdering of droplets in the centrifugal injectors are accomplished better than the direct flow injectors. To this reason, in modern liquid propellant engines, the centrifugal injectors are used. The centrifugal injectors are divided to two types : one component and two components. At one component injectors, the fuel and oxidizer are injected separately, but at two components injectors, both oxidizer and fuel are injected from a complex structure. The injection rate at injector plate, is one of the effective parameters on walls cooling, combustion stability and propulsive force (thrust) in the combustion chamber. In order to attaining the suitable injection rate, the effect <b>of</b> <b>injector</b> arrangement must be investigated. In this paper, after designing five different plans, the optimum injection rate has been investigated and selected. The method is the meshing <b>of</b> <b>injector</b> plate, determining the input value of oxidizer and fuel rates into each element and then computation of injection rate by means of a computer code. The mentioned code computes the distribution of flow rate at the lateral section of combustion chamber by using the geometric conditions <b>of</b> <b>injector</b> plate, the position and the flow rate <b>of</b> <b>injectors.</b> This code is usable for all kinds of one and two components injectors and has been validated by using of experimental test possilbilities and the error has been lower than six percent...|$|R
