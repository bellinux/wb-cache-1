5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{discovery}} of the Watkins memo, and based upon a suggestion from the Office of Independent Counsel, on March 20, 1996, Attorney General Janet Reno requested that Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr expand his inquiry to specifically include the travel office affair, in particular allegations that White House employees had lied about Hillary Clinton's role in the firings, and that David Watkins or Hillary Clinton had made false statements in previous testimony to the GAO, <b>Congress,</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Independent Counsel.|$|E
5|$|With no {{resources}} available from either <b>Congress</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Continental Army, Irvine gave permission for volunteers to organize their own offensive. Detroit {{was too far}} and too strong for a small-scale operation, but militiamen such as David Williamson believed that an expedition against the American Indian towns on the Sandusky River was feasible. It {{was to be a}} low-budget campaign. Each volunteer had to provide at his expense a horse, rifle, ammunition, rations, and other equipment. Their only payment would be an exemption from two months of militia duty, plus whatever plunder might be taken from the Indians. Because of ongoing Indian raids—the wife and children of a Baptist minister were killed and scalped in western Pennsylvania on May 12, 1782—there was no shortage of men willing to volunteer.|$|E
25|$|Before 1938, {{the federal}} courts, like almost all other common law courts, decided {{the law on}} any issue where the {{relevant}} legislature (either the U.S. Congress or state legislature, depending on the issue), had not acted, by looking to courts in the same system, that is, other federal courts, even on issues of state law, and even {{where there was no}} express grant of authority from <b>Congress</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Constitution.|$|E

Up to a point, the rules and regulations of the many federal executive agencies have a similar effect.

25|$|On 21 June 2008, the Bahujan Samaj Party, or the BSP, with 18 seats, {{announced}} {{withdrawal of}} its support after the Congress starting opposing the UP government where the BSP was the ruling party.

She also accused both parties of misusing the Central Bureau of Investigation or the CBI and attempting to implicate her in the Taj Corridor Case. She also accused Congress of making false promises {{to help the people}} of Bundelkhand and Poorvanchal regions as they were suffering from drought.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, through its power of {{judicial}} review, the Supreme Court has defined {{the scope and}} nature of the powers and separation between the legislative and executive branches of the federal government; for example, in United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp. (1936), Dames & Moore v. Regan (1981), and notably in Goldwater v. Carter (1979), (where it effectively gave the Presidency the power to terminate ratified treaties without the consent of <b>Congress</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Senate). The Court's decisions can also impose limitations on the scope of Executive authority, as in Humphrey's Executor v. United States (1935), the Steel Seizure Case (1952), and United States v.

25|$|Lincoln's {{assassination}} {{had taken}} place roughly sixteen years before in the closing stages of the Civil War. On the other hand, Garfield's term was marked (for the most part) by peacetime, and a general complacency with respect to presidential security had developed by this time. Garfield, like many other presidents, often preferred to interact directly with the public and although some form of security was almost certainly in place, a comprehensive security detail had not been seriously considered by either <b>Congress</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> president up to that point. Remarkably, {{it would not be}} until the assassination of William McKinley some twenty years later that Congress would finally task the United States Secret Service (founded to prevent counterfeiting) with the responsibility of ensuring the president's personal safety.|$|E
25|$|Marbury posed a {{difficult}} {{problem for the}} court, which was then led by Chief Justice John Marshall, the same person who had neglected to deliver the commissions {{when he was the}} Secretary of State. If Marshall's court commanded James Madison to deliver the commissions, Madison might ignore the order, thereby indicating the weakness of the court. Similarly, if the court denied William Marbury's request, the court would be seen as weak. Marshall held that appointee Marbury was indeed entitled to his commission. However, Justice Marshall contended that the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional, since it purported to grant original jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in cases not involving the States or ambassadors. The ruling thereby established that the federal courts could exercise judicial review over the actions of <b>Congress</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> executive branch.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution {{does not}} {{explicitly}} give judicial review to the Court, and Jefferson {{was very angry}} with Marshall's position, for he wanted the President to decide whether his acts were constitutional or not. Historians mostly agree that {{the framers of the}} Constitution did plan for the Supreme Court {{to have some sort of}} judicial review; Marshall made their goals operational. Judicial review was not new and Marshall himself mentioned it in the Virginia ratifying convention of 1788. Marshall's opinion expressed and fixed in the American tradition and legal system a more basic theory—government under law. That is, judicial review means a government in which no person (not even the President) and no institution (not even <b>Congress</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court itself), nor even a majority of voters, may freely work their will in violation of the written Constitution. Marshall himself never declared another law of Congress or act of a president unconstitutional.|$|E
2500|$|Such considerations, however, do {{not allow}} us to set aside first principles. The President's {{authority}} to act, as with the exercise of any governmental power, 'must stem either from an act of <b>Congress</b> <b>or</b> from <b>the</b> Constitution itself.' ...|$|R

500|$|Generally, a {{nomination}} from {{a member of}} <b>Congress</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> vice president is required to receive an appointment to the United States Naval Academy. [...] A nomination does not guarantee an appointment and in a typical year only about 38% of nominees receive an appointment. [...] Currently each member of Congress {{and the vice president}} can have five appointees attending the Naval Academy at any time. [...] Other nomination sources include the secretary of the Navy, who may appoint 170enlisted members of the regular and reserve Navy and Marine Corps to the Naval Academy each year, and the president may nominate an unlimited number of children of career military personnel for up to 100appointments each year. [...] Additionally, children of Medal of Honor recipients and select cadets of JROTC Honor Unit with Distinction units do not need {{a nomination}} but need only qualify for admission. The United States Merchant Marine Academy only accepts nominations from members of Congress. [...] There are no Presidential, Vice-Presidential, military-affiliated, JROTC-honor unit, ROTC or Unit Commander, or Medal of Honor nominations permitted to the USMMA.|$|E
500|$|A {{congress}} of states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed.

Hereafter, they will be referred to as the 'Allies'. Sparta and Athens had {{a leading role in the}} congress but interests of all the states played a part in determining defensive strategy. Little is known about the internal workings of the <b>congress</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> discussions during its meetings. Only 70 of the approximately 700 Greek cities sent representatives. Nevertheless, this was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.|$|E

500|$|In 1857, the Supreme Court held in Dred Scott v. Sandford that African slaves, former slaves, {{and their}} {{descendants}} were not eligible to be citizens. After the Civil War (1861–65) and the resulting abolition of slavery in the United States, steps were taken to grant citizenship to the freed slaves. Congress first enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which included a clause declaring [...] "all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power" [...] to be citizens. Even as the Civil Rights Act was being debated in Congress, its opponents argued that the citizenship provision was unconstitutional. In light of this concern, {{as well as to}} protect the new grant of citizenship for former slaves from being repealed by a later Congress, the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution included a Citizenship Clause, which would entrench in the Constitution (and thereby set beyond the future reach of <b>Congress</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> courts) a guarantee of citizenship stating that [...] "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States". [...] The Fourteenth Amendment—including the Citizenship Clause—was ratified by state legislatures and became a part of the Constitution in 1868.|$|E
500|$|In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors to city states {{throughout}} Greece, {{asking for}} food, land, and water as tokens of their submission to Persia. [...] However, Xerxes' ambassadors deliberately avoided Athens and Sparta, hoping thereby that those {{states would not}} learn of the Persians' plans. States that were opposed to Persia thus began to coalesce around these two city states. A congress of states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed. This confederation had powers both to send envoys to ask for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. Herodotus does not formulate an abstract name for the union but simply calls them [...] "οἱ [...] Ἕλληνες" [...] (the Greeks) and [...] "the Greeks who had sworn alliance" [...] (Godley translation) or [...] "the Greeks who had banded themselves together" [...] (Rawlinson translation).
