5|$|<b>Corrective</b> rape is on {{the rise}} in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped weekly, as {{estimated}} by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit. It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of <b>corrective</b> rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the Western Cape live in fear of being sexually assaulted, as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008. Yet, victims of <b>corrective</b> rape are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|In other instances, {{managers}} deliberately {{used the}} reforms {{as an opportunity}} to cut wages, exaggerating wage cuts made by the ministries so that {{they would be able to}} cut back on overall expenditure.

5|$|The <b>Corrective</b> Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) {{system was}} {{designed}} to correct the spherical aberration for light focused at the FOC, FOS, and GHRS. It consists of two mirrors in the light path with one ground to correct the aberration. To fit the COSTAR system onto the telescope, {{one of the other}} instruments had to be removed, and astronomers selected the High Speed Photometer to be sacrificed. By 2002, all of the original instruments requiring COSTAR had been replaced by instruments with their own <b>corrective</b> optics. COSTAR was removed and returned to Earth in 2009 where it is exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum. The area previously used by COSTAR is now occupied by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.|$|E

5|$|Discarding one's <b>corrective</b> lenses, as Bates recommended, or wearing lenses {{weaker than}} one's {{prescribed}} correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations, especially {{when one is}} operating a motor vehicle. James Randi related that his father, shortly after discarding glasses {{on the advice of}} Bates' book, wrecked his car. Bates method teachers often caution that when driving, one should wear the correction legally required.|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} about the metaphysics of management is considered especially {{from the point of}} view of the subject, acts and object of management. Management is understood holistically, in connection to production, rather than as an independent domain in itself. In terms of metaphysics, the time-honoured {{question about}} the superiority of thing (substance, matter) ontology or process ontology is addressed. The determination of metaphysical commitments is discussed. Empirical evidence on the appropriateness of alternative metaphysical assumptions in management is forwarded. It is concluded that Western management thinking has been dominated by thing metaphysics. This has led to deficient conceptualizations and counterproductive methods, present in the 20 th century. There have been process metaphysics based <b>correctives,</b> which include Japanese-originated methods and out-of-the box methods developed by Western parties. These <b>correctives</b> have often outperformed their substance based counterparts, but their adoption in the West has been slow. It is concluded that the Western metaphysical assumptions, especially when implicit, hinder learning, understanding and implementation of the process based <b>correctives</b> in the realm of management. However, even if the dominant Western metaphysics constrains our thinking, it might be possible to break out of it, through appropriate ontology training...|$|R

Encyclopædia Britannica, however, describes the regime as authoritarian and nationalistic rather than fascist.

5000|$|LFM {{curricula}} generally {{consists of}} discrete topics which all students begin together. After beginning a unit, {{students will be}} given a meaningful and formative assessment so that the teacher can conclude whether or not an objective has been mastered. At this step, instruction goes in one of two directions. If a student has mastered an objective, he or she will begin on a path of enrichment activities that correspond to and build upon the original objective. Students who do not satisfactorily complete a topic are given additional instruction until they succeed. If a student does not demonstrate that he or she has mastered the objective, then a series of <b>correctives</b> will be employed. These <b>correctives</b> can include varying activities, individualized instruction, and additional time to complete assignments. [...] These students will receive constructive feedback on their work and will be encouraged to revise and revisit their assignment until the objective is mastered.|$|R
40|$|Brazil {{is one of}} {{the major}} coffee {{producers}} in the world, because of this, the goal of this study was to assess the regional differences of coffee cultivation for the reference crops 2001 / 2002 and 2002 / 03 by means of a life cycle assessment (LCA) in order to generate detailed production inventory data as well as quantify the potential environmental impacts of this crop. All information considered in this study (use of water, fossil based energy, fertilizers, pesticides and <b>correctives)</b> was taken from data collected from the producing farms. Four Brazilian coffee producer regions located at the Southeastern region were evaluated: Sul de Minas Gerais and Cerrado Mineiro in Minas Gerais State, and Mogiana and Alta Paulista regions in São Paulo State. The data refer to a production of 25. 2 million kg of green coffee. Depending on the considered region, the production of 1, 000 kg of green coffee requires, on average, approx. 9, 300 to 13, 000 kg of total energy, 70 to 130 kg of diesel, 6, 500 to 12, 700 kg of process water, 270 to 340 kg of fertilizers (NPK), 2. 0 to 13. 0 kg of pesticides, 230 to 600 kg of <b>correctives,</b> and yield around 1, 600 to 1, 900 kg/ha. Despite 20 % of the coffee growers showing a good environmental performance, i. e. consumption of pesticides, fertilizers and <b>correctives</b> lower than the regional averages, this study has also identified some farms that can probably reduce the amount of some inputs and enhance their environmental performance...|$|R
