40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} the levels of hormone, Lipid, Iron and Vitamins in the serum of the primary infertility women. There are many biological causes of infertility, including some that medical intervention can treat. The blood samples collected were analysed for hormone (LH,FSH,PROLACTIN,ESTRADIOL),LIPIDS (cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL VLDL,LDL), Iron, Haemoglobin, Serum, Ferritin and vitamins (D,E,C). The results were analysed with graph pad prism software and are tabulated as follows. The level of LH, FSH, PROLACTIN and ESTRADIOL were found to be increased in the test group on <b>comparison</b> <b>with</b> control. The level of CHOLESTEROL, LDL, VLDL were found to be increased in the test group on <b>comparison</b> <b>with</b> control.
