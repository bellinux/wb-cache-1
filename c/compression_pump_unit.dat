40|$|A solar {{trigeneration}} system, {{based on}} photovoltaic-thermal (PV/T) collectors, photovoltaic (PV) modules and a heat <b>pump</b> <b>unit</b> for heating and cooling, is modelled to forecast the thermal and electric yields of the system. The {{aim of the}} trigeneration system is to provide enough electricity, domestic hot water (DHW), heating and cooling power to meet the typical demand of an urban single family dwelling with limited roof area and allow the household to achieve a positive net energy status. The PV/T collectors and PV modules provide the electricity while the former also powers the DHW component of the trigeneration system. The heating and cooling components rely on a vapour <b>compression</b> cycle heat <b>pump</b> <b>unit</b> powered by electricity. In Fong et al. (2010), solar-powered electric compression refrigeration {{was found to have}} the most energy saving potential in subtropical climates. Thus, a heat pump based cooling system is a cost effective solution for residential applications in Lisbon, Portugal. Thus, according to the dwelling's location, construction details and energy demand patterns, the model computes the system's net results by comparing the dwelling demand with the trigeneration system supply. The paper presents a breakdown of the proposed trigeneration system model and describes each component briefly. Preliminary results produced by the model are presented and analysed in order to identify possible ways of improving the overall system performance. 2...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES Indoor {{residual}} spraying (IRS) is {{a proven}} tool to reduce visceral leishmaniasis vectors in endemic villages. In India IRS {{is being done}} with stirrup pumps, whereas Nepal, Bangladesh, and other countries use <b>compression</b> <b>pumps.</b> The present {{study was conducted with}} the objectives to compare the efficiency, cost and user friendliness of stirrup and <b>compression</b> <b>pumps.</b> METHODS The study was carried out in Gorigawan village of the Vaishali district in north Bihar and included a total population of 3259 inhabitants in 605 households. Spraying with 50 per cent DDT was done by two teams with 6 persons per team under the supervision of investigators over 5 days with each type of pump (10 days in total using 2 stirrup <b>pumps</b> and 3 <b>compression</b> <b>pumps)</b> by the same sprayers in an alternate way. The spraying technique was observed using an observation check list, the number of houses and room surfaces sprayed was recorded and an interview with sprayers on their satisfaction with the two types of pumps was conducted. RESULTS On average, 65 houses were covered per day with the <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> and 56 houses were covered with the stirrup pump. The surface area sprayed per squad per day was higher for the <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> (4636 m²) than for the stirrup pump (4102 m²). Observation showed that it was easy to maintain the spray swath with the <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> but very difficult with the stirrup pump. The wastage of insecticide suspension was negligible for the <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> but high for the stirrup pump. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS The <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> was found to be more user friendly due to its lower weight, easier to operate, lower operation cost, higher safety and better efficiency in terms of discharge rate and higher area coverage than the stirrup pump.  A A...|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{efficiency}} of a rotary <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> is the ratio between the volume {{in contact with}} the vacuum and the smallest contracted volume {{in contact with the}} valve. If the ratio is 1:1000 and the pump is exhausting to atmospheric pressure, the highest achievable vacuum is 1/1000 of atmospheric pressure. This corresponds to 0.76 Torr or 101.3 Pa. This limitation makes rotary <b>compression</b> <b>pumps</b> very hard to construct if lower pressures than about 1 Torr is to be achieved. The simplicity of the process makes the rotary <b>compression</b> <b>pump</b> cheap and it is widely used as a low vacuum pump or a fore pump to a diffusion pump.|$|R

Due to the inherent structure of the beam <b>pumping</b> <b>units,</b> the balanced torque curve of gearbox has a bigger fluctuation ratio and negative torque that results low motor efficiency and load impact. Because the motor efficiency is directly proportional to the fluctuation ratio of gearbox torque, many researchers designed many types of energy-saving devices to improve the system efficiency.

As a special case, Russian gas pumping system has the longest pipes with large diameter, which carry great amounts of natural gas. So, as reconstruction and modernization needs large investments, a need of more effective and low cost tool appeared. As a result diagnostics became the most wide-spread method for lifecycle assessment, and lifecycle extension for gas <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> and pipelines. One of the most effective method for diagnostics of gas <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> is parametric diagnostics. It is based on evaluation of measurement of several termo-gas dynamic parameters of gas <b>pumping</b> <b>units,</b> such as pressures, temperatures and rotational speed of turbines and compressors.
