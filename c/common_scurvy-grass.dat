The river drains a watershed including parts of the Northern Pennine Orefield, {{as a result of}} which high levels of heavy metal have built up in the river shingle, and on this thrive a community of metal-tolerant plants. Common across the site are alpine penny-cress (Thlaspi alpestre), spring sandwort (Minuartia verna), <b>common</b> <b>scurvy-grass</b> (Cochlearia officinalis agg.), mountain pansy (Viola lutea) and thrift (Armeria maritima).|$|E
5000|$|Menawethan (Men an Wedhen, {{the tree}} stone) (...) , is a steep-sided island to the {{south-east}} {{of the group}} with vegetation that is typical of islands with breeding seabirds. It {{was one of the}} first islands where Natural England carried out rat eradication. Some areas are covered in hottentot fig (probably carried to the island by gulls); thrift and sea campion also dominate in some areas. Other species recorded include Yorkshire fog, orache, <b>common</b> <b>scurvy-grass</b> and tree-mallow which forms temporary stands in some years. Brookweed (Samolus valerandi), a plant restricted to cliff flushes in Cornwall and an unusual plant in Scilly, grows among rocks above the shore. The rocky shore is used by grey seal for haul outs. There is a Bronze Age cairn on the summit. The island is recorded as Mynangwython c1588.|$|E

Verrucaria species such as V. maura are black; Xanthoria parietina and Caloplaca marina are bright yellow and orange; Lecanora atra is grey; and Ramalina siliquosa is green. Rock samphire (Crithmum maritimum) is found on rock ledges and crevices, 6-10 m above the high water mark along with sea spleenwort (Asplenium marinum), <b>common</b> <b>scurvy-grass</b> (Cochlearia officinalis), buck's-horn plantain (Plantago coronopus), thrift (Armeria maritima) and rock sea-spurrey (Spergularia rupicola). Cliff breeding birds along the coast are fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), peregrine (Falco peregrinus), raven (Corvus corax) and rock pipit (Anthus petrosus). The chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), last bred on the north Cornwall coast in 1952 and is currently breeding in the Land's End and Lizard areas.|$|E
