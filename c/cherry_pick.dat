40|$|This paper {{provides}} comprehensive, detailed {{documentation of}} major corporate governance reforms (CGRs) undertaken by 26 advanced and emerging economies.

To answer this question, we estimate the CGRs’ impacts on foreign acquirers’ tendency to pick better performing firms in emerging markets. We argue the <b>cherry</b> <b>picking</b> is {{partly due to}} emerging countries’ weaker IP than acquirer countries’, predicting a positive relation between the degree of <b>cherry</b> <b>picking</b> and the gap in the strength of IP. If the CGRs strengthen IP, the gap will decrease (increase) following a CGR in a target’s (acquirer’s) country, moderating (intensifying) the <b>cherry</b> <b>picking</b> tendency. This is what we find when we estimate difference-in-differences in <b>cherry</b> <b>picking</b> before and after a CGR.
