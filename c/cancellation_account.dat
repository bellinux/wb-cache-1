30|$|It is {{important}} to note that the two types of cancellability rely on two types of cancellation which are called explicit and contextual cancellation. In a sense, these two types of cancellation are rather different. While explicit cancellation pertains to a particular utterance context, contextual cancellation refers to a sentence uttered and the meanings that can be communicated with it in different utterance contexts. Accordingly, Jaszczolt maintains that explicit cancellation is an empirically verifiable phenomenon, whereas contextual cancellation is just a kind of thought experiment (see Jaszczolt 2009 : 261). However, in what follows I argue that this view on the two types of cancellation is highly misleading and that both of them should be considered thought experiments: either we have to imagine a cancellation clause which cancels the implicature, or we have to imagine an utterance context in which the utterance does not give rise to the implicature. 2 This view on explicit and contextual <b>cancellation</b> <b>accounts</b> for the fact that both are part of the Gricean cancellability test which is nothing else than one of several diagnostic tools used to distinguish between conventional and conversational implicatures.|$|R
40|$|Background: This study investigates case {{cancellations}} on {{the intended}} day of surgery (DOS) at a paediatric hospital in Melbourne, Australia. The hospital in Melbourne treats over 32 000 inpatients annually and handles both elective and emergency cases. Methods: The {{data for this}} paper were collected {{over a period of}} 12 months, from June 2004 to June 2005. The data were extracted retrospectively from the theatre computer system. A nurse researcher reviewed the full written details of all cancellations to clarify their cause and confirm the reasons for cancellation; the reasons for cancellation were then sorted into one of 14 groups. Results: There were 16 559 theatre bookings, and of these, 1198 (7. 2 %) were cancelled on the DOS. There was a mean of 3. 28 cancellations of surgery on the intended day. The hospital-initiated postponements accounted for 18. 5 % of DOS cancellations. The top four reasons for <b>cancellation</b> <b>accounted</b> for 65 % of all cancelled surgeries and were all patient initiated. Conclusions: There was also evidence that some specialties were more susceptible to DOS cancellation than others.

40|$|The long awaited baryonic B decay B̅^ 0 → pp̅ was {{recently}} observed by LHCb with a branching fraction of order 10 ^- 8. All the earlier model predictions are too large compared with experiment. In this work, we {{point out that}} for a given tree operator O_i, the contribution from its Fiertz transformed operator, an effect often missed in the literature, tends to cancel the internal W-emission amplitude induced from O_i. The wave function of low-lying baryons are symmetric in momenta and the quark flavor with the same chirality, but antisymmetric in color indices. Using these symmetry properties and the chiral structure of weak interactions, we find {{that half of the}} Feynman diagrams responsible for internal W-emission cancel. Since this feature holds in the charmless modes but not in the charmful ones, we advocate that the partial <b>cancellation</b> <b>accounts</b> for the smallness of the tree-dominated charmless two-body baryonic B decays. This also explains why most previous model calculations predicted too large rates as the above consideration was not taken into account. Finally, we emphasize that, contrary to the claim in the literature, the internal W-emission tree amplitude should be proportional to the Wilson coefficient c_ 1 +c_ 2 rather than c_ 1 -c_ 2.

40|$|In many {{application}} {{areas such}} as airlines and hotels {{a large number of}} bookings are typically cancelled. Explicitly taking into <b>account</b> <b>cancellations</b> creates an opportunity for increasing revenue. Motivated by this we propose a revenue management model based on Talluri and van Ryzin (2004) that takes <b>cancellations</b> into <b>account</b> in addition to customer choice behaviour. Moreover, we consider overbooking limits as these are influenced by cancellations. We model the problem as a Markov decision process and propose three dynamic programming formulations to solve the problem, each appropriate in a different setting. We show that in certain settings the problem can be solved exactly using a tractable solution method. For other settings we propose tractable heuristics, since the problem faces the curse of dimensionality. Numerical results show that the heuristics perform almost as good as the exact solution. However, the model without cancellations can lead to a revenue loss of up to 20 percent. Lastly we provide a parameter estimation method based on Newman et al. (2014). This estimation method is fast and provides good parameter estimates. The combination of the model, the tractable and well-performing solution methods, and the parameter estimation method ensures that the model can efficiently be applied in practice.

The fundamental problem of MIMO feasiblity refers to whether it is possible to sup- port specified numbers of streams allocated to the links of a MIMO network while cancelling all interference. In unilateral interference <b>cancellation,</b> nodes <b>account</b> only for interfering links that they have been assigned to cancel and ignore other interfering links. This can be safely done because, under a proper interference cancellation assignment, the ignored interference is assigned to other nodes for handling. We present several different formulations of the unilateral feasibility problem and use these formulations to analyze the problem?s complexity and develop heuristic feasibility algorithms. We first prove that the general unilateral feasibility problem is NP-complete. We then identify several special cases where the problem is solvable in polynomial time. These include when only receiver-side interference cancella- tion is performed, when all nodes have two antenna elements, and when the maximum degree of the network?s interference graph is two. Finally, we present several heuristic feasibility algorithms derived from different problem formulations and we evaluate their accuracies on randomly generated MIMO networks...|$|R

40|$|The {{rotation}} {{states of}} kilometer sized near earth asteroids {{are known to}} be affected by the YORP effect. In a related effect, Binary YORP (BYORP) the orbital properties of a binary asteroid evolves under a radiation effect mostly acting on a tidally locked secondary. The BYORP effect can alter the orbital elements in ∼ 10 ^ 4 - 5 years for a D_p= 2 km primary with a D_s= 0. 4 km secondary at 1 AU. It can either separate the binary components or cause them to collide. In this paper we devise a simple approach to calculate the YORP effect on asteroids and BYORP effect on binaries including J_ 2 effects due to primary oblateness and the sun. We apply this to asteroids with known shapes as well as a set of randomly generated bodies with various degrees of smoothness. We find a strong correlation between the strengths of an asteroid's YORP and BYORP effects. Therefore, a statistical knowledge on one, could be used to estimate the effect of the other. We show that the action of BYORP preferentially shrinks rather than expands the binary orbit and that YORP preferentially slows down asteroids. This conclusion holds for the two extremes of thermal conductivities studied in this work and assuming the asteroid reaches a stable point, but may break down for moderate thermal conductivity. The YORP and BYORP effects are shown to be smaller than what could be naively expected due to near cancellation of the effects on small scales. Taking this near <b>cancellation</b> into <b>account,</b> a simple order of magnitude estimate of the YORP and BYORP effects as function of the sizes and smoothness of the bodies is calculated. Finally, we provide a simple proof showing that there is no secular effect due to absorption of radiation in BYORP. Comment: Accepted to Astronomical Journa...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Ambulatory {{surgery is}} a {{standard}} of care for many surgical procedures due to cost-effectiveness and benefits to patients including the reduced risk of contracting hospital infection by reducing the hospital stay. However, late cancellations can be costly. We examined the utilisation of the surgical day ward in our institution over a four-year period. Methods: A retrospective study of surgical day ward records from September 2007 to September 2011 in one institution. Parameters investigated included the number of planned admissions. Reasons for cancellations were also collected. Results: A total of 17, 461 procedures were intended as a day ward admission during the study interval. There were 3, 539 procedures that were cancelled (20. 3 %). The prevalent proportion of cancellations (n = 1, 367) (38. 6 %) were due to patients not showing up for their procedures (7. 8 % of planned admissions); 1, 188 (33. 6 %) patients were cancelled by the admissions office due to bed shortages, accounting for 6. 8 % of planned admissions and 650 (18. 4 %) of cases were due to last minute <b>cancellations</b> by patients, <b>accounting</b> for 3. 7 % of all planned admission. The remaining 334 (9. 4 %) of cases were cancelled on medical grounds including patients who were considered unfit for the intended procedure, or anti-coagulations not appropriately ceased prior to surgery, accounting for 1. 9 % of all planned admissions. Conclusion: The cancellation rate {{in this study was}} high, mainly due to failure of patients to attend or signal their intentions, inadequate bed capacity and bed closure strategies.

40|$|Flight {{cancellations}} are costly {{events for}} both airlines and passengers, yet are poorly understood. This dissertation expands upon literature that has studied flight cancellations by incorporating more variables and using advanced model specifications. In addition, {{it is necessary}} to understand the drivers of flight cancellations to quantify the relationship between flight cancellations and flight delay forecasts, which has been poorly documented in the literature. This dissertation investigates the factors leading to flight cancellations and quantifies the effect of flight cancellations on flight delay forecasts. First, econometric choice models are applied to a large dataset of historical flight information to determine the preferences and behaviors of airlines with respect to flight cancellations. The binary logit estimation results show that flight characteristics, such as load factor, distance, and flight frequency, are significant for determining the likelihood of flight <b>cancellations,</b> even when <b>accounting</b> for adverse weather effects. Airline-specific logit models indicate large heterogeneity with respect to flight cancellation tendencies across the industry. Inter-flight heterogeneity is explored through the use of mixed logit and latent class models, but lack of significant heterogeneity and long computation times provide evidence that a basic binary model can be sufficient for capturing the flight cancellation behavior of airlines. Cancellation predictions are made at an airport-level, but the distribution of predicted cancellations does not match well with the actual distribution observed in the data. Second, deterministic queueing methods are used to quantify the effect flight cancellations have on queueing delay forecasts. The cancellation model estimates are used to predict flight cancellations for a sample of all flights for 160 airport-days. The reductions in delay due to cancellations are captured using Monte Carlo simulation and a first-order approximation. The simulation results show that delays are reduced by 22 % when considering the effect of cancellations and the first-order approximation results are no more than 4 % larger than those from the Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, a case study was performed based on the current operating environment at San Francisco International Airport, where capacity reductions are expected during the summer of 2014 due to runway construction. Moreover, airlines are proposing schedules with 5 % more demand. The increased schedule combined with the capacity decrease leads to an large increase in the queueing delay forecasts. A cancellation model is used to predict the changes in delay that result from cancellations induced by the change in operating conditions. The results from the cancellation model indicate that departure cancellations will increase at an almost one-to-one ratio with the proposed demand increase, thus negating any benefit to airlines from a denser schedule. The feedback of cancellations on queueing delay is further explored with analytical models. As witnessed in the case study, queueing delay can reach a theroetical maximum where any additions to the flight schedule results in higher queueing delays and an associated increase in flight cancellations that compensate for the additional flight and return the demand, and queueing delay, to its original level...|$|R
