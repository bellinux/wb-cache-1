On August 22, convection organized while the system was over the western Bahamas, and it developed into Tropical Depression Eleven later that day. <b>Conditions</b> <b>were</b> only marginally favorable due to lack of outflow to its west, but the depression strengthened to reach tropical storm status on August 23.|$|E
5|$|A weak surface trough, located to {{the west}} of an upper-level low, {{developed}} convection to the east of the Bahamas on July 26. A tropical wave entered the area two days later, resulting in an increase of convective organization and area. Although <b>conditions</b> <b>were</b> not favorable for tropical cyclone formation, it sped to the northwest and steadily organized, developing a surface area of low pressure on the 30th. On July 31, the system continued to organize, and developed into Tropical Depression One while located 200miles (320km) to the east of Jacksonville, Florida.|$|E

After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
