Roughly, a student scores <b>a</b> 5.5 (<b>pass)</b> when 2/3 (67%) of an exam is correct.

40|$|According to Claude Lévi-Strauss, {{the cuisine}} <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> link from stage of nature to stage of culture. Based on ethnographic {{research}} among the Mbyá-Guarani, this article analyzes this assertion under {{the light of}} the Amerindian cosmology. However, the dichotomy between nature and culture does not apply to indigenous groups, since for these nature and culture <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> hybrid. To this hybridism might also be added the domain of supernatural. In terms of analysis this hybrid configuration does not allow any kind of transition from one domain to another. Yet the transition is possible among the three possible conditions of life in cosmos – animality, humanity and divinity. Human beings may perform the transition to animality as well as the transition to divinity. But no matter the course of the transition, although in different conditions in cosmos, from humanity one will always achieve animality. As conceptualized by Lévi-Strauss, from culture always occurs the trasition to nature. However, in one direction ex-humans will control nature beings, in another one, they will be controlled by nature. This isn’t just about a peculiarity of indigenous groups, it may also be found in societies so-called “modern”, however under others shapes...|$|R

40|$|Interventionist {{research}} (IVR), {{such as the}} constructive {{research approach}} (CRA), has been suggested as a method to improve the relevance of management accounting (MA) research. Although literature identifies several perspectives on relevance, the current assessment of CRA focuses on practical relevance. Moreover, an overreliance on pragmatism in assessing CRA research {{in the form of}} CRA market tests has been criticized. This article analyses the challenges inherent in conducting and assessing CRA research, both conceptually and with a CRA case example. In order to overcome these possible CRA challenges, we suggest analyzing CRA relevance from multiple perspectives. The perspectives in question are those of practical value relevance, legitimative decision relevance, academic value relevance, and instrumental decision relevance. Further, we suggest that indications of relevance in CRA studies can be analyzed during the research project. In particular, we introduce the relevance test as an explicit part of the CRA research process. We suggest a new tool, the Relevance Diamond would facilitate conducting the relevance test and aid the analysis of CRA relevance from multiple perspectives. Furthermore, we suggest new interpretations of what should <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> in the CRA market tests under special circumstances, thereby contributing to CRA methodology, and especially to the analysis of relevance and ‘battlefields’ of different interests in CRA/IVR projects...|$|R
5000|$|The {{conversion}} of the lowest passing grade may present another problem. A grade of 4 is a clear [...] "fail", which may be compensated as described above. A mark 5, on the other hand, is [...] "almost satisfactory" [...] and may be about that of the D in many systems, which counts as <b>a</b> weak <b>pass,</b> but as <b>an</b> average is too low for admission into a higher cycle of education. This however depends {{on the level of}} training the grade is compared to, as a D would not <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> level at vwo level but may reach equivalence for the havo level when the differences between philosophies and methods are being taken into account. There is also some ambiguity in the interpretation of the 5 mark in the Dutch educational system. For purposes of assessing a pupil's progress throughout the year, a 5 is usually considered to be good enough, provided the pupil does better on following tests. For final examinations, a 5 is unacceptable as an average, but in high schools one mark 5 is condoned for one profile subject (except for maths in some cases) and one subject in either the compulsory or free choice segment. In higher education, most courses require a minimum average of 6 on all subjects. Moreover, in the Dutch system resits of examinations are more common, allowing pupils who did not attain a sufficient grade to redeem it one or several times, whereas in other systems candidates may be sent away sooner. Furthermore, Dutch pupils are more likely to return and retry applying for the desired level of vocational education, while British candidates would continue at a lower level instead.|$|R
5000|$|People {{applying}} to become citizens must satisfy certain requirements. For example, {{there have been}} requirements that applicants have been permanent residents for five years (three if married to a U.S. citizen), be of [...] "good moral character" [...] (meaning no felony convictions), be of [...] "sound mind" [...] in the judgment of immigration officials, have knowledge of the Constitution, {{and be able to}} speak and understand English unless they are elderly or disabled. Applicants must also <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> simple citizenship test. Up until recently, a test published by the Immigration and Naturalization Service asked questions such as [...] "How many stars are there in our flag?" [...] and [...] "What is the Constitution?" [...] and [...] "Who {{is the president of the}} United States today?" [...] At one point, the Government Printing Office sold flashcards for $8.50 to help test takers prepare for the test. In 2006, the government replaced the former trivia test with a ten-question oral test designed to [...] "shun simple historical facts about America that can be recounted in a few words for more explanation about the principles of American democracy, such as freedom". One reviewer described the new citizenship test as [...] "thoughtful". While some have criticized the new version of the test, officials counter that the new test is a [...] "teachable moment" [...] without making it conceptually more difficult, since the list of possible questions and answers, as before, will be publicly available. Six correct answers <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> grade. The new test probes for signs that immigrants [...] "understand and share American values". A unique way to become a permanent resident is to apply to the US government DV lottery. This program is a drawing for foreigners to apply for a drawing to become a permanent resident.|$|R
5000|$|Possible {{scores on}} an {{individual}} test within the GED battery, range from a minimum of 100 {{to a maximum of}} 200. [...] A score of 200 {{on an individual}} test puts the student in the top 1% of graduating high school seniors. ACE issues recommendations for what <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> minimum <b>passing</b> score for any given sub-test (currently 145) and for the test as a whole (currently 580—i.e., an average of 145 per test across all four sub-tests). Although most GED-issuing jurisdictions (for the most part, Boards of Education of U.S. states) adopt these minimum standards as their own, a jurisdiction may establish higher standards for issuance of the certificate if it chooses. Many jurisdictions award honors-level equivalency diplomas to students meeting certain criteria higher than those for a standard diploma in a given jurisdiction. Some districts hold graduation ceremonies for GED Tests passers and/or award scholarships to the highest scorers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) {{and type}} 2 both target T lymphocytes, yet induce radically {{different}} phenotypic outcomes. HTLV- 1 is a causative agent of Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), whereas HTLV- 2, highly similar to HTLV- 1, causes no known overt disease. HTLV gene products {{are engaged in}} a dynamic struggle of activating and antagonistic interactions with host cells. Investigations focused on one or a few genes have identified several human factors interacting with HTLV viral proteins. Most of the available interaction data concern the highly investigated HTLV- 1 Tax protein. Identifying shared and distinct host-pathogen protein interaction profiles for these two viruses would enlighten how they exploit distinctive or common strategies to subvert cellular pathways toward disease progression. Results We employ a scalable methodology for the systematic mapping and comparison of pathogen-host protein interactions that includes stringent yeast two-hybrid screening and systematic retest, as well as two independent validations through an additional protein interaction detection method and a functional transactivation assay. The final data set contained 166 interactions between 10 viral proteins and 122 human proteins. Among the 166 interactions identified, 87 and 79 involved HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2 -encoded proteins, respectively. Targets for HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2 proteins implicate a diverse set of cellular processes including the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the apoptosis, different cancer pathways and the Notch signaling pathway. Conclusions This study <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> first <b>pass,</b> with homogeneous data, at comparative analysis of host targets for HTLV- 1 and - 2 retroviruses, complements currently existing data for formulation of systems biology models of retroviral induced diseases and presents new insights on biological pathways involved in retroviral infection. </p...|$|R

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{historical}} compromise between Labour and Capital—the so-called “Swedish model”—and the abandonment of this compromise {{in connection with the}} third industrial revolution. The focus of the study lies in the transformations in working life and labour internationalism from 1973 to 1993. The strategies of the trade union regarding the protection of workers’ rights at local, national and international levels are of particular interest. The relations between the Company Union Group at LM Ericsson, the Swedish Metalworkers’ Federation and the local union at Ericsson’s work premises in Colombia (Sintraericsson) are examined in depth. The research is conducted through archive studies and interviews according to oral history theories. The theoretical perspectives in the dissertation are mainly inspired by postcolonial and materialist world system theories. The examined relations took place in a time that {{from the point of view}} of the trade union was characterized by uncertainty and anxiety about the future. The visible effects of the technological and industrial processes of transformation in Sweden as well as in Colombia had increased, and one of the main manifestations of the changes was the decreasing demand of manual labour. The introduction of the electronic AXE-system at LM Ericsson industries <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> significant <b>pass</b> toward increasingly minimized and decreasing labour-intensive telecommunication systems. In Colombia, the local management took advantage of both the political unrest and instability and the absence of functional legislation praxis of work in order to set back and, finally, repudiate Sintraericsson. Many obstacles were mounted impeding the realization of collected and vigorous international labour actions which, had these been successful, would have <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> response to the union-hostile actions initiated by the company. The Swedish Metalworkers’ Federation and the Company Union Group at LM Ericsson in Sweden were faced with several strategical and ideological issues resulting in their support of Sintraericsson appearing as obligatory or even absent. The study further shows that LM Ericsson as a company had advantages when compared with the Labour Organizations in Sweden and Colombia. The company early established business connections in Colombia and had knowledge about, and was an active part of, the Colombian society. The company was not driven by moral principles though it on the one hand could point at Colombian laws and norms, and on the other hand at overreaching economical “laws” when it came to motivating the politics vis-à-vis the employees, the local union and the frequent dismissals of union activists at Ericsson de Colombia...|$|R
