5|$|Among the {{folklore}} {{that has}} developed around the film over the years, there is a belief that Blade Runner cursed the <b>companies</b> <b>whose</b> logos were displayed prominently as product placement. While they were market leaders at the time, Atari, Bell, Cuisinart, and Pan Am all experienced setbacks after the film's release. The Coca-Cola Company suffered losses when it introduced New Coke in 1985, but soon regained market share.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery <b>companies</b> <b>whose</b> traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} reasons for the {{reluctance}} of some dealers to sell plug-in electric vehicles. PEVs do not offer car dealers the same profits as gasoline-powered car. Plug-in electric vehicles take more time to sell because of the explaining required, which hurts overall sales and sales people commissions. Electric vehicles also may require less maintenance, resulting in loss of service revenue, and thus undermining the biggest source of dealer profits, their service departments. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADS), dealers on average make {{three times as much}} profit from service as they do from new car sales. However, a NADS spokesman said there was not sufficient data to prove that electric cars would require less maintenance. According to the New York Times, BMW and Nissan are among the <b>companies</b> <b>whose</b> dealers tend to be more enthusiastic and informed, but only about 10% of dealers are knowledgeable on the new technology.|$|E

Scott Nova, executive director of Worker Rights Consortium, said the donation is too little to make the industry safe, particularly because many factories do not even have basic safety features such as fire escapes.
