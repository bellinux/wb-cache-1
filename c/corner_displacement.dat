40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a finite-difference computational method, which describes the plane {{state of stress}} of the orthotropic materials. By using {{a function of the}} displacement potential, the determination of boundary condition as load for the vertical side on the left is exemplified. The convex corner case is treated separately, when the <b>corner</b> <b>displacement</b> is free and when it is prevented or prescribed. When displacement is imposed in both directions, we analyze the situation in which only one side is leaning, and when both sides are embedded. Depending on the number of points inside, on the sides and the number of convex and concave corners, the number of points on the imaginary boundary and inside the domain under analysis can be established.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} an idealised {{solar sail}} {{consisting of a}} uniform, elastic, isotropic square membrane that is prestressed by two pairs of equal and opposite forces applied at the corners. Two wrinkling regimes are identified. The first regime occurs for symmetric and moderately asymmetric loading; {{it is characterised by}} small, radial corner wrinkles. The second regime occurs for strongly asymmetric loading and is characterised by a single, large diagonal wrinkle, plus small radial corner wrinkles. An analytical method for predicting wrinkle wavelengths and out-of-plane wrinkle displacements, as well as in-plane <b>corner</b> <b>displacements</b> of the membrane, is presented. The analytical predictions are validated against experimental measurements and detailed finite element simulation results. The accuracy achieved is typically better than 20 % on wavelengths and 30 % on amplitudes. Finite element analysis using thin shell elements is shown to be able to replicate real physical experimentation with an accuracy better than 20 %.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the visual characteristics of some Italian phones (/’a/, /b/, /v/) are modified in emotive speech by {{the expression of the}} "big six" emotions: joy, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, and fear. In this research we specifically analyze the interaction between the articulatory lip targets of the Italian vowel /’a/ and consonants /b/ and /v/, defined by phonetic-phonological rules, and the labial configurations, peculiar to each emotion. This interaction was quantified {{on the basis of the}} variations of the following parameters: lip opening, upper and lower lip vertical displacements, lip rounding, anterior/posterior movements (protrusion) of upper lip and lower lip, left and right lip <b>corner</b> horizontal <b>displacements,</b> left and right <b>corner</b> vertical <b>displacements,</b> and two asymmetry parameters, calculated as the difference between right and left corner position along the horizontal and the vertical axes. The first aim of this research is to quantify the modifications of the lip articulatory parameters due to the emotions; the second aim is to analyze the parameters which are subject to phonetic-phonological constraints and are consequently less influenced by emotions. The results are useful to define the emotive speech production models and are presently employed in researches conearning audiovisual speech synthesis (Talking Heads). Â© 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multiscale finite element homogenization technique (MFEH) for modelling nonlinear deformation of multi-phase materials. A novel condensation technique to relate force variations {{acting on the}} representative volume element (RVE) – involving antiperiodicity of traction forces at RVE <b>corners</b> – and <b>displacement</b> variations on boundary-nodes is proposed. The formulation to accommodate the condensation technique and overall tangent modulus is presented in detail. In this context, the effective homogenised tangent modulus is computed {{as a function of}} microstructure stiffness matrix which, in turn, depends upon the material properties and geometrical distribution of the micro-constituents. Numerical tests concerning plastic materials with different voids distributions are presented to show the robustness of the proposed MFEH...|$|R

40|$|Visual {{tracking}} is {{very important}} for many applications in computer vision, such as traffic control, intelligent surveillance, industry automation, human computer interaction, etc. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical framework for estimating displacement vectors at feature points with the coarse-to-fine block matching method. Feature points are chosen to be the image locations having large curvature, i. e., the corners. First, we calculate the pyramid for each image. At the toppest layer of the pyramid, <b>corners</b> and their <b>displacement</b> vectors are estimated with the block matching method. These displacement vectors are used to predict and narrow down the search region of the following lower layer of the pyramid. Early jump-out technique is also used to enhance the efficiency of block matching. Reliable displacement fields are obtained efficiently at the lowest layer of the image pyramid. 1 Introduction Visual tracking {{is very important}} for many applications in computer vision, such [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the results of steady and {{unsteady}} aerodynamic computations for the design of the IWEX model (German for: Unsteady Vortex Experiment). The main character of the thickness caused vortex developing at the round leading edge of the lambda wing is analyzed. The experimental concept of the new test rig, the new wind tunnel walls and the half wing model is briefly described. The characteristics of the main and the smaller tip vortex are specified. The inboard movement of the main vortex with the angle of attack and the consequences for the suction peak and the load distribution is determined. As the whole free stream Mach number range of the test envelope from 0. 3 – 0. 7 was important for the structural design, transonic effects, especially shock - vortex interactions triggering vortex development, were studied. During the design of a peniche, the differences of the flow character to the reference results without wind tunnel walls were minimized. The effects of <b>corner</b> separation and <b>displacement</b> are specified at different stages of the iterative process. Finally, the basic unsteady results for a pitching motion are discussed, mainly considering global and distributed coefficients...|$|R
40|$|Multiphase flow in porous {{media is}} {{important}} in many natural and industrial processes, including geologic CO 2 sequestration, enhanced oil recovery, and water infiltration into soil. Although {{it is well known}} that the wetting properties of porous media can vary drastically depending on the type of media and pore fluids, the effect of wettability on multiphase flow continues to challenge our microscopic and macroscopic descriptions. Here, we study the impact of wettability on viscously unfavorable fluid-fluid displacement in disordered media by means of high-resolution imaging in microfluidic flow cells patterned with vertical posts. By systematically varying the wettability of the flow cell over a wide range of contact angles, we find that increasing the substrate's affinity to the injected fluid results in more efficient displacement of the defending fluid up to a critical wetting transition, beyond which the trend is reversed. We identify the pore-scale mechanisms [...] -cooperative pore filling (increasing <b>displacement</b> efficiency) and <b>corner</b> flow (decreasing <b>displacement</b> efficiency) [...] -responsible for this macroscale behavior, and show that they rely on the inherent 3 D nature of interfacial flows, even in quasi- 2 D media. Our results demonstrate the powerful control of wettability on multiphase flow in porous media, and show that the markedly different invasion protocols that emerge [...] -from pore-filling to post-bridging [...] -are determined by physical mechanisms that are missing from current pore-scale and continuum-scale descriptions...|$|R
40|$|The IWEX {{wind tunnel}} model (Instationäres Wirbelexperiment, German for: Unsteady Vortex Experiment) was {{developed}} to study vortical flow at static and oscillating angles of attack. Numerical computations were performed beforehand to study important aerodynamic aspects. The focus {{of this paper is}} on those results that were affecting the design of the model. The experimental concept of a new test rig, wind tunnel walls and the new half wing model is briefly described. The lambda wing has a purely round leading edge with a constant nose radius to chord ratio of 0. 5 %. The flow characteristics of the main vortex, generated at the nose of the main wing, and the smaller tip vortex are specified. The inboard motion of the main vortex with increasing angle of attack and the consequences for the load distribution are described. The free stream Mach number range of the test envelope is from 0. 3 to 0. 7. Therefore, transonic effects, especially shock–vortex interactions triggering vortex development, had to be analyzed for a safe design of the model. A peniche was designed to minimize the differences of the flow character compared to reference results of the model without wind tunnel walls. The effects of <b>corner</b> separation and <b>displacement</b> are specified at different stages of the iterative process.

40|$|Abstract We analyze seismic and {{acoustic}} {{data from}} a series of controlled truck bomb explosions to develop scaling laws and functional relations between charge size and various waveform properties. The explosions had yields of 3 – 12 103 kg trinitrotoluene (TNT), and the receivers were placed at distances of 1 – 16 km, so the data mimic the data previously recorded from actual terrorist truck bombings. We examine four airblast properties (peak overpressure, impulse per unit area, pulse duration, and average shock velocity) and three seismic properties (peak displace-ment of P wave, low-frequency asymptote of displacement spectrum, and the <b>corner</b> frequency of <b>displacement</b> spectrum) as potential yield estimators. Impulse per unit area and pulse duration observations prove to be the most robust yield indicators; however, peak overpressure, peak displacement, and low-frequency spectral asymp-tote have significant utility as well. The acoustic scaling laws are more portable than the seismic scaling laws because regional differences in atmospheric structure can be well described by pressure and temperature observations, while regional differ-ences in geologic structure are dependent on a large number of less accessible pa-rameters. We apply the scaling laws developed here to seismic waveforms of the 1998 Nairobi bombing and find a yield of 2. 0 – 6. 0 103 kg TNT. This value is consistent with but more precise than a previous estimate made via a time domain waveform inversion. Additional testing indicates that our functional relations are likely applicable to surface chemical explosions in general and not limited solely to truck bombs...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{kinematics}} of a third-order zig-zag plate model {{accounting for}} the zero transverse shear stress conditions at upper and lower free surfaces irrespective for the lay-up, a eight-noded, 56 d. o. f. curvilinear plate element is formulated and tested. Nodal parameters are membrane displacements, transverse shear rotations, deflections, slopes and curvatures for <b>corner</b> nodes, membrane <b>displacements</b> and transverse shear rotations for mid-side nodes. Suitably defining the parameters appearing in the plate model, some higher-order plate elements, comprising previous zig-zag elements and some smeared-laminate plate elements, are obtained as particular cases. The benchmark problem is the cylindrical bending of simply-supported, symmetric and antisymmetric cross-ply plates under a sinusoidally distributed transverse loading. The body of numerical results is as follows. Closed-form solutions for the present plate model, together with the ones that can be particularized in it, are given that provide analytical comparison results. Finite element results by the present element and by {{the ones that are}} particularized in it are compared with closed-form solutions and with the exact three-dimensional elasticity solution, available for this benchmark problem. A great importance of stress-free conditions appears when plates are thick and unsymmetric. This justify development of present element accounting for unsymmetry in the lay-up. The quadratic approximation makes the present element able to accurately predict stresses by integrating local equilibrium equations. Inclusion of the layerwise kinematics of zig-zag models allows for satisfactory predictions of transverse shear stresses via constitutive equations. Use of C 2 approximation for deflections, instead of C 1 approximation required for obtaining conforming elements, appear to little improve accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the early}} age {{behavior}} of concrete {{is an important}} issue in construction of concrete structures since different factors during construction, such as design consideration, material usage, and environmental influence, can alter the original configuration of the structure intended by the engineers and hence the structure may experience and exhibit undesired consequences. The primary interest of this research was to model the behavior of concrete under environmental excitations, such as the variation of temperature and relative humidity, during the early age after concrete placement. Experimental test results were obtained and mathematical models were developed for this research. Modeling the effect of curing process in response to the relative humidity variation {{was one of the main}} objectives of this research. A mathematical model for back-calculating the diffusion coefficient of cured concrete from experimental test was proposed. This back-calculated diffusion coefficient of concrete was indicative of the effectiveness of curing application provided during construction. Corner deflection model for predicting lift-off displacement and climatic stress model for predicting crack formations were formulated in order to predict the distress behavior of concrete for a given design and construction scenario. Probabilistic models for lift-off displacement and cracking were formulated to predict the probabilities of such distresses. Material properties, such as strength, elastic modulus, creep, drying shrinkage, were obtained from experimental program and were used as input in these distress prediction models. In order to assess the effectiveness of different curing compounds, two indices, such as curing index and overall curing index, were proposed. These indices were able to distinguish the difference in performance among different curing compounds. For validating the proposed <b>corner</b> lift-off <b>displacement</b> model and climatic stress model, numerical simulations were performed and the obtained results were compared with the field observations. The probabilistic models for predicting lift-off displacement and cracking behavior were validated by comparing the numerical simulation results with the field observations at Houston Intercontinental, TX. The predictions from these models were found to be in close agreement with the experimental observations. Furthermore, in order to assess the impact of a given design and construction, analytical study was performed with these models. In the sensitivity analysis, parameters of interest were the geometry of the structure, the effect of curing application, and the influence of time as well as the season of construction on the distress potentials. Numerical simulations indicated that the curing application was able to lower the early age distress potentials. The thicker slabs/overlays versus the thinner ones exhibited differences in performance in terms of distress potentials. The analytical study also revealed that it was possible to vary the distress potentials by varying the time as well as the season of construction. Finally, a constructability index was proposed in order to assist in decision making with regard to different designs and construction scenarios with a view to minimize the distress potentials in concrete structure. The results indicated that the constructability index was able to capture and demonstrate the effect of different parameters mentioned above on the constructability of rigid pavement/overlay projects...|$|R
40|$|This report reviews four of {{the main}} {{approaches}} (two band-limited and two broadband) currently used for estimating the site κ 0 : the acceleration slope (AS) above the <b>corner</b> frequency, the <b>displacement</b> slope (DS) below the corner frequency, the broadband (BB) fit of the spectrum, and the response spectral shape (RESP) template. Using these four methods, estimates of κ 0 for rock sites in Central Eastern North America (CENA) in the shallow crustal dataset from NGAEast are computed for distances less than 100 km. Using all of the data within 100 km, the mean κ 0 values are 8 msec for the AS approach and 27 msec for the DS approach. These mean values include negative κ estimates for some sites. If the negative κ values are removed, then the mean values are 25 msec and 42 msec, respectively. Stacking all spectra together led to mean κ 0 values of 7 and 29 msec, respectively. Overall, the DS approach yields 2 – 3 times higher values than the AS, which agrees with previous observations, but {{the uncertainty of the}} estimates in each case is large. The AS approach seems consistent for magnitudes down to M 3 but not below. There is large within-station variability of κ that may be related to differences in distance, Q, complexity along the path, or particular source characteristics, such as higher or lower stress drop. The station-to-station differences may be due to site-related factors. Because most sites have been assigned Vs 30 = 2000 m/sec, {{it is not possible to}} correlate variations in κ 0 with rock stiffness. Based on the available profile, the individual spectra are corrected for crustal amplification and only affect results below 15 Hz. Since the AS and DS approaches are applied over different frequency ranges, we find that only the DS results are sensitive to the amplification correction. More detailed knowledge of individual near-surface profiles may have effects on AS results, too. Although κ is considered to be caused solely by damping in the shallow crust, measurement techniques often cannot separate the effects of damping and amplification, and yield the net effect of both phenomena. The two broadband approaches, BB and RESP, yield similar results. The mean κ 0 _BB is 5 ± 0. 5 msec across all NEHRP class A sites. The κ 0 _RESP for the two events examined is 5 and 6 msec. From literature, the average value of κ 0 in CENA is 6 ± 2 msec. This typical value is similar to the broadband estimates of this study and to the mean κAS when all available recordings are used along with all flags. When only recordings with down-going FAS slope are selected from the dataset, the mean value of κAS increases by a factor of 2 – 3. To evaluate the scaling of high-frequency ground motion with κ, we analyze residuals from ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) versus κ estimates. Using the κ values from the AS approach, the average trend of the ln(PSA) residuals for hard-rock data do not show the expected strong dependence on κ, but when using κ values from the DS approach, there is a stronger correlation of the residuals, i. e., a κ that is more consistent with the commonly used analytically based scaling. The κDS estimates may better reflect the damping in the shallow crust, while the κAS estimates may reflect a net effect of damping and amplification that has not been decoupled. The κDS estimates are higher than the κAS estimates, so the expected effect on the high-frequency ground motion is smaller than that expected for the κAS estimates. An empirical hard-rock site factor model is developed that represents the combined Vs-κ 0 site factor relative to a 760 m/sec reference-site condition. At low frequencies (10 Hz), the residuals do not show the strong increase in the site factors as seen in the analytical model results. A second hard-rock dataset from British Columbia, Canada, is also used. This BC hard-rock residuals show an increase in the 15 – 50 Hz range that is consistent with the analytical κ 0 scaling for a hard-rock κ 0 of about 0. 015 sec. The variability of the PSA residuals is also used to evaluate the κ 0 scaling for hard-rock sites from analytical modeling. The scatter in existing κ 0 values found in literature is disproportionately large compared to the observed variability in high-frequency ground motions. We compared the predicted ground-motion variability based on analytical modeling to the observed variability in our residuals. While the hard-rock sites are more variable at high frequencies due to the additional κ 0 variability, this additional variability is much less than the variability predicted by the analytical modeling using the variability from κ 0 -Vs 30 correlations. This is consistent with weaker κ 0 scaling compared to that predicted by the analytical modelling seen in the mean residuals...|$|R
