50|$|Another {{problem for}} General Host {{was that a}} <b>competing</b> <b>offer</b> by Greyhound Corp. for Armour had secured that company a one-third interest, keeping General Host from authorizing a merger with Armour or a {{consolidation}} for tax purposes. Accordingly, General Host sold its Armour stock to Greyhound in May 1970 for $211 million, of which nearly $100 million was in not easily traded Greyhound warrants and convertible preferred stock. General Host reported a $67.3 million loss for 1969, including an extraordinary loss of $58.3 million, mainly from the Armour transactions. To fend off a possible challenge from unhappy shareholders, the managers had pushed {{through a series of}} far-reaching amendments to General Host's certificate of incorporation in October 1969, making it harder to oust them from office.|$|E
