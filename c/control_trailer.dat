Between 1935 and 1950, the District line had a weed-killing train, initially consisting of a 1905-built B stock driving motor car and a <b>control</b> <b>trailer.</b> The two cars were kept at Ealing Common depot, but the <b>control</b> <b>trailer</b> was scrapped in 1937 and replaced by a second motor car, to provide more power. Weed-killing duties were not carried out during the Second World War, and the vehicles were not refurbished subsequently. They were scrapped in 1950.|$|E
2500|$|... the MBTA owned 481 coaches. Of these, 420 were {{in active}} service and 61 {{inactive}} for various reasons. Coaches whose designations start with BTC (Blind Trailer Coach) are conventional coaches, while those starting with CTC (<b>Control</b> <b>Trailer</b> Coach) are cab cars. [...] Cab cars will occasionally also {{appear in the}} middle of a consist. Coaches acquired before 1990 were single-level cars with 88 to 127 seats; those since are bilevel cars with 173 to 185 seats.|$|E

50|$|By {{the time}} the final cars had been delivered, the {{standard}} stock was operating on the Northern, Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines. There were 724 cars on the Northern line, consisting of 336 motor cars, 243 <b>trailers</b> and 145 <b>control</b> <b>trailers.</b> This group comprised all of the cars made in 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1926, supplemented by 62 per cent of the 1927 build by Metropolitan, and 13 of the 1927-built Feltham cars. The Piccadilly line had 509 cars, comprising some of the 1927 Metropolitan and Feltham batches, most of the 1929 Feltham stock, the experimental 1930 Feltham train, {{and all of the}} 1931 and 1934 stock. The Bakerloo line also had some of the 1927 Metropolitan and Feltham batches, four cars from the 1929 Feltham build and the 1930 Metropolitan stock. This was a total of 198 cars, made up of 82 motor cars, 62 <b>trailers</b> and 54 <b>control</b> <b>trailers.</b> To make up the number of trains, an additional 20 <b>trailers</b> and 20 <b>control</b> <b>trailers</b> were needed, and these were cars of 1920 Cammell Laird air-door stock.|$|R

50|$|There are {{fifteen of}} these units {{throughout}} the state; each has the capabilities to treat upwards of 100 people with medical supplies and equipment inside a temperature <b>controlled</b> <b>trailer,</b> enabled with H.E.A.R.S. radios, generators, and outdoor lighting.|$|R
50|$|A Tangara is a {{double-deck}} four-car set, {{with the}} two outer cars being driving <b>control</b> <b>trailers</b> fitted with one pantograph each and the middle two cars being non-control motor cars. They are equipped with air conditioning and chopper control.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the total}} of {{fourteen}} cars, four were End Driving Motors, located {{at the ends of}} each unit, two were Middle Driving Motors, located {{in the middle of the}} unit, and eight were trailers. Later, two of the trailers were rebuilt into <b>Control</b> <b>Trailers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 201-207 (odd numbers only) were wood body 52 seat coaches {{built by}} Jewett in 1905. They had four [...] motors as built. Car 205 was later {{converted}} into a <b>control</b> <b>trailer.</b> All were still in service in 1957.|$|E
50|$|For {{stopping}} trains (including the Alton line), 38 two-car units designated 2-BIL were produced; {{these had}} side corridors and lavatories, but no corridor {{connection between the}} coaches. They had one <b>control</b> <b>trailer</b> coach and one motor coach equipped with two 275 hp (205 kW) motors and Metrovick control equipment.|$|E
50|$|In 1928-30 {{the cars}} were {{converted}} to use electro-pneumatic brakes and the formation changed to 7-cars DM-T-T-SM-CT-T-DM, the SM cars having only one motored bogie. After 1938 guard control air-operated doors were installed and a <b>control</b> <b>trailer</b> bogie motored with equipment from the recently scrapped electric locomotives. The formation was DM-T-T-SM-SM-T-T-DM.|$|E
5000|$|... 316-321 were wood body 52 seat coaches {{built by}} Jewett in 1913-1914. These {{were the last}} wood body cars bought. #319-321 {{received}} new model [...] motors, control equipment, and brake equipment around 1922. These three cars were usually assigned together and/or with <b>control</b> <b>trailers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 140 {{cars were}} built, divided equally {{between the two}} suppliers, in Britain by both Brush Traction and Metropolitan Cammell, with the {{remaining}} 280 built in France by Ateliers. 192 of the cars were driving motors, thirty-two were <b>control</b> <b>trailers</b> and the remaining 196 cars were trailers.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, the Neuchâtel tram system took {{delivery}} of four matching double-sided motor cars and <b>control</b> <b>trailers,</b> to a design derived {{from that of}} the Forchbahn cars. These built by SWS, whilst two further motor cars were added in 1988 with bodies built by Schindler Waggon and trucks by SIG.|$|R
50|$|Three {{of these}} trains had the cars streamlined, based upon trial with a 1923 Standard Stock <b>Control</b> <b>Trailer</b> built by Metropolitan Cammell. The {{cars in the}} fourth set had flat fronts almost {{identical}} to the later 1938 stock, for which the cars of the 1935 Stock were in effect the prototypes.|$|E
50|$|Mobile <b>Control</b> <b>Trailer</b> (MCT) is {{a control}} systems trailer {{used by the}} United Lands Central Security Agency. It is {{primarily}} used as an equipment carrier and mobile control systems transporter. It {{is designed to be}} towed by an ATV due to its lightweight, and is able to reach remote areas. There is a civilian version as well available to the public.|$|E
5000|$|Carolyn and Florence were wood body parlor cars built Niles in 1904 and 1906. Carolyn was a <b>control</b> <b>trailer.</b> Florence had two [...] motors. At first special {{services}} seemed important, but as business increased and more seats were needed Carolyn was converted to 52 seat coach #209 in 1924. Florence was converted to parlor-buffet car #601, then was rebuilt into 53 seat coach #435 in 1929.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cars were}} {{initially}} {{used on the}} Piccadilly tube. The trailer cars were numbered 800-819, the converted motor cars were 480-499, and the <b>control</b> <b>trailers</b> were initially 700-719, but were renumbered to 1700-1719 in 1926. The trailers became 1316-1335 and the <b>control</b> <b>trailers</b> 2043-2062 in 1930, and in 1934, following the formation of London Transport {{and the introduction of}} a standard numbering scheme, the trailers became 7230-7249, while the <b>control</b> <b>trailers</b> were given the numbers 5170-5189. The cars were considered to be drab, when compared with new stock being delivered to the Hampstead Line around 1930, and they were refurbished. [...] As built the cars had longitudinal seating through the length of the car, providing seats for 44 passengers. As part of the refurbishment, the central bay was fitted with transverse seats, increasing the capacity to 48, and armrests were fitted to the remaining seats. The cement floors were replaced by wooden slat flooring, and the lighting was improved. Changes were also made to the couplers between the cars, and the air-doors on the driving cabs of the <b>control</b> <b>trailers</b> were replaced by swing doors. The 1906 motor cars were withdrawn, and the trains were completed by the addition of Standard Stock motor cars, built by the Metropolitan Carriage & Wagon Company in 1927. At the time, the Piccadilly line was being extended, with the extensions involving open-air running, and the 1920 stock was unsuitable for use in wet conditions. It was therefore transferred to the Bakerloo line between January and October 1932. Following the introduction of the 1929/30 batch of Standard Stock, which was the first to be fitted with electro-pneumatic brakes, a decision was taken to convert all of the Standard Stock to use this system. Most had been fitted with the new equipment by 1936, but the exceptions were the motor cars running with the 1920 stock. These were not converted until 1938 when the 1920 stock was withdrawn from passenger service.|$|R

50|$|The set was {{originally}} numbered 900 {{in the old}} hauled carriage set number series, but this was amended in February 1966 to 701 in the new series for <b>trailer</b> <b>control</b> units. Despite this, and its designation as 7-TC (7-car <b>Trailer</b> <b>Control</b> stock), {{it was not a}} real <b>trailer</b> <b>control</b> unit in that a locomotive could not be operated remotely from the unit's driving cars.|$|R
50|$|In 1925, two {{driving motor}} cars were built as prototypes {{for what would}} later become the T stock. In the London Passenger Transport Board {{numbering}} scheme, they became 2598 and 2599. After the trailer cars were withdrawn from service in the 1940s, the two driving motor cars remained in service on the East London Line, being used with a 1923-built <b>control</b> <b>trailer.</b> These three cars were withdrawn in 1950.|$|E
50|$|The Millennium train, {{like the}} Tangara, {{is a double}} decker. It is a four car consist, with the middle two cars being {{non-control}} motor cars and the two outer cars being driving <b>control</b> <b>trailer</b> cars fitted with the pantograph. The Millennium train is equipped with an AC drive system, whereas the Tangara has a DC drive system. The sets usually operate in eight-car formations with two four-car sets combined.|$|E
5000|$|The Northern City Line had {{previously}} been served by surface stock, {{and had to be}} modified to accommodate the Standard Stock. Additionally, it had a non-standard arrangement of the third and fourth rails which supplied power to the cars, and these were modified to the same configuration as on the Northern line during the refurbishment. The use of control trailers at one end of a short train was virtually discontinued during the 1930s, because of the risks of disruption to services. A 3-car train consisted on a driving motor car, a trailer and a <b>control</b> <b>trailer</b> (DM-T-CT) and only had one compressor on the motor car. If it failed, the train was stranded, causing delays, whereas a 4-car short train had two motor cars (DM-T-T-DM) and hence two compressors. Failure of one did not prevent the train continuing. The exception to the use of control trailers was the off-peak trains on the Northern City Line, which consisted of a driving motor car and a <b>control</b> <b>trailer,</b> and these 2-car trains continued to run until October 1964.|$|E
5000|$|In 1919, the Metropolitan Railway {{converted}} six 1904 saloon stock cars {{into the}} [...] "Hustler train". These {{were the only}} cars of this type: two were driving motors, two were <b>control</b> <b>trailers,</b> which the Metropolitan called driving trailers, and the remaining two were trailers. In 1936, the two driving motors were converted into trailers, and all six cars were used with two 1925-built prototype driving motors.|$|R
5000|$|... 600-604 were 54 seat coach {{trailers}} {{built by}} Cincinnati in 1913 for the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway. They were bought in 1937 after that railway ceased service. Originally motor cars, their motors were removed {{to make them}} <b>control</b> <b>trailers.</b> Their bodies were modified with tapered vestibules and curved ends, like the new all-steel cars. After modifications they were used system-wide with other cars.|$|R
2500|$|The report, {{published}} February 1902, {{found that}} the multiple unit was superior, and in May 1902 the CLR ordered 64 motor cars, 40 from Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon and 24 from Metropolitan Amalgamated Railway Carriage & Wagon. Seating 42 passengers, 24 in transverse bays and 18 on longitudinal seating, these were powered by two GE66 [...] traction motors. Deliveries started in January 1903 and by June the railway had converted its fleet. The locomotives were offered for sale, and 24 sold for scrap in 1906. Two were kept by the CLR for shunting in the depot yard, the last withdrawn in 1942. In 1904 six additional trailers from Birmingham arrived and sixty-six trailers were converted into <b>control</b> <b>trailers.</b> Normally trains were formed of six cars with motor cars at either end and <b>control</b> <b>trailers</b> in the centre, although sometimes seven-car trains were formed. Between 1912–14 tripcocks and deadman handles were fitted to the motor cars and control trailers; before then there were two men in the cab.|$|R
5000|$|... the MBTA owned 481 coaches. Of these, 420 were {{in active}} service and 61 {{inactive}} for various reasons. Coaches whose designations start with BTC (Blind Trailer Coach) are conventional coaches, while those starting with CTC (<b>Control</b> <b>Trailer</b> Coach) are cab cars. Cab cars will occasionally also {{appear in the}} middle of a consist. Coaches acquired before 1990 were single-level cars with 88 to 127 seats; those since are bilevel cars with 173 to 185 seats.|$|E
50|$|The {{builders}} {{were given}} a partial specification, which ensured that each car would have 48 seats and two sets of air-operated double doors on each side, providing an opening which was 4.5 ft wide. Beyond these basic guidelines, each builder was allowed to build a trailer car to its own design, although externally, they looked very similar. The <b>control</b> <b>trailer</b> was designed by the Underground Electric Railways.The stock {{became known as the}} 1922 Stock or Competition Stock and was considered part of the Standard stock fleet.|$|E
50|$|A control car, <b>control</b> <b>trailer</b> {{or driving}} trailer is a generic {{term for a}} non-powered {{railroad}} (US) or railway (UIC) vehicle that can control operation of a train from the end opposite {{to the position of}} the locomotive. They can be used with Diesel or electric motive power, allowing push-pull operation without the use of an additional locomotive. They can also be used with a power car or a railcar. In a few cases control cars were used with steam locomotives, especially in Germany and France (see article Voiture État à 2 étages).|$|E
5000|$|Full triple circuit air [...] "S" [...] {{cam drum}} brakes acting on all wheels drums via slack adjuster, all brake {{cylinders}} were remotely vented. First brake circuit acts on front wheels, the second on rear wheels {{and the third}} <b>controls</b> <b>trailer</b> service brakes. Unique design feature was remotely mounted brake valve which was operated via hydraulic master and slave cylinder principle on the Hauler 6x6 or via mechanical linkage on 8x8 models.|$|R
50|$|The TVR {{used the}} system in both rural and {{suburban}} situations, and it was commercially successful for some time; the TVR had 19 steam railcars at the peak, with first and third class accommodation. They had the disadvantage of inflexibility at busy times, and the small traction units became worn out after {{a decade and a}} half. At that stage the TVR converted the coaches to push-and-pull <b>control</b> <b>trailers,</b> using small independent locomotives as the power unit.|$|R
