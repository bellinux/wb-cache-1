50|$|In the C0 {{control code}} set used in ASCII, ETB {{is a short}} name for the End-of-Transmission-Block {{character}} (code 23, or 0x17, or ^W in caret notation). It is a <b>communication</b> <b>control</b> <b>character</b> used to indicate {{the end of a}} block of data for communications purposes. ETB is used for blocking data when the block structure is not necessarily related to the processing function. The symbol's ASCII number is 2417.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between the two sets of printer <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> might be the portability of ASA <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> versus the hardware dependency of machine <b>control</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Also {{note that}} C0 and C1 <b>control</b> <b>character</b> sets are independent; the C0 <b>control</b> <b>character</b> set {{designated}} by [...] (which {{happens to be}} the NATS control set for newspaper text transmission) {{is not the same as}} the C1 <b>control</b> <b>character</b> set designated by [...] (the CCITT attribute control set for Videotex).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a distributed networked control system (DNCS) consisting of multiple agents communicating over a lossy communication channel, e. g., wireless channel. Two aspects of DNCSs are studied {{in this paper}} – state estimation and stabilizing <b>communication</b> <b>control.</b> Based on the Kalman filter, optimal linear filtering algorithms are derived for the discrete-time linear dynamic models of the DNCS with lossy links. Then, the problem of finding a <b>communication</b> <b>control</b> which stabilizes a DNCS is considered. The stabilizing <b>communication</b> <b>control</b> problem seeks the acceptable ranges of packet loss rates at which the overall system is stable. Efficient algorithms based on convex optimization are developed for solving the stabilizing <b>communication</b> <b>control</b> problem...|$|R
50|$|Many {{computer}} systems allow {{the user to}} enter a <b>control</b> <b>character</b> by holding down Ctrl and pressing the letter used in the caret notation. This is practical, because many <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> (e.g. EOT) cannot be entered directly from a keyboard. Although {{there are many ways}} to represent <b>control</b> <b>characters,</b> this correspondence between notation and typing makes the caret notation suitable for many applications.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{software}} requires {{using the}} HTML code [...] or [...] {{instead of the}} invisible Unicode <b>control</b> <b>character</b> itself. Using the invisible <b>control</b> <b>character</b> directly could also make copy editing difficult.|$|R
50|$|There are {{additional}} (rarely used) features for switching <b>control</b> <b>character</b> sets, {{but this is}} a single-level lookup: the 0x00-0x1F range is the C0 <b>control</b> <b>character</b> set, the 0x80-0x9F range is the C1 <b>control</b> <b>character</b> set, and there are escape sequences which switch in various alternatives. It is required that any C0 character set include the ESC character at position 0x1B, so that further changes are possible.|$|R
5000|$|Link <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> {{start with}} odd parity, {{followed}} by a one bit, followed by two bits. Odd-1 means that the character is a link <b>control</b> <b>character.</b> 00 is the flow <b>control</b> <b>character</b> FCC, 01 is a normal end of packet EOP, 10 is an exceptional end of packet EEOP, and 11 is an escape character ESC. A NULL is the sequence [...] "ESC FCC".|$|R
50|$|<b>Control</b> <b>characters</b> {{are often}} {{rendered}} into a printable form known as caret notation by printing a caret (^) {{and then the}} ASCII character that has a value of the <b>control</b> <b>character</b> plus 64. <b>Control</b> <b>characters</b> generated using letter keys are thus displayed with the upper-case form of the letter. For example, ^G represents code 7, which is generated by pressing the G key when the control key is held down.|$|R
50|$|Textual {{characters}} come in standardized {{character sets}} containing also <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> such a newline character, which arrange text.

Second, we formalize the 2 ̆ 2 optimum window size 2 ̆ 2 that keeps the increase of communication time in minimum. Third, we implement a <b>communication</b> <b>control</b> mechanism and evaluate it on the environment that simulates satellite communication line.

50|$|An ASCII <b>control</b> <b>character</b> under quoted-printable or UTF-7 may be {{represented}} {{either directly or}} encoded (escaped). The need to escape a given <b>control</b> <b>character</b> depends on many circumstances, but newlines in text data are usually coded directly.|$|R
50|$|A form of <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> were {{introduced}} in the 1870 Baudot code: NUL and DEL.The 1901 Murray code added the carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF), and other versions of the Baudot code included other <b>control</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|R

50|$|Printer <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> and Carriage <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> are IBM {{mainframe}} {{terms that}} denote the special meaning {{which the first}} character on a line of printable text may have. The first character of each line of text is interpreted as a <b>control</b> <b>character</b> or printer command instead of a character to be printed if a corresponding attribute is set for the print data set (data set is mainframe speak for {{what is known as}} a file on other operating systems).|$|R
50|$|These provide Unicode {{with native}} {{paragraph}} and line separators {{independent of the}} legacy encoded ASCII <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> such as carriage return (U+000A), linefeed (U+000D), and Next Line (U+0085). Unicode does not provide for other ASCII formatting <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> which presumably then {{are not part of}} the Unicode plain text processing model. These legacy formatting <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> include Tab (U+0009), Line Tabulation or Vertical Tab (U+000B), and Form Feed (U+000C) which is also thought of as a page break.|$|R
40|$|A Dialogue of Forms is an {{investigation}} of typeface design tools and processes. The aim of this investigation is to develop techniques of deriving letterforms automatically from a subset of letters called the <b>control</b> <b>characters.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> are representative letters that contain the primary structural elements, design attributes, and proportional rela-tionships that characterize a typeface. Design information derived from the <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> is used to constrain the design of other letterforms. The lower case letters o, h, v, and p are the <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> studied in this investigation. The <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> are interactively created and edited by the designer, and stored as sets of primitive parts. These parts are used as building blocks to construct other letters automatically. Knowledge about letterform structure and font design consistency is represented and used to manage the derivation process. Generated designs may be edited by the designer and changes to parts can be propagated. Automatic letterform derivation can aid the designer by reducing time consuming labor...|$|R
50|$|Machine <b>control</b> <b>characters,</b> in contrast, are {{the very}} {{commands}} which IBM line printers understand. This is why they are hardware dependent or hardware determined. IBM defined this set of commands for their line printers and made sure all their line printers understand them. Other (mainframe) line printer manufacturers also {{had to make sure}} their printers understood those commands. Since machine <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> are hardware commands, many of them are not displayable characters and therefore machine <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> are always specified as hexadecimal values.|$|R
5000|$|For example, {{character}} 10 {{represents the}} [...] "line feed" [...] function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents [...] "backspace".

50|$|Normal mode {{starts with}} three players. There are captive {{characters}} littered across all levels, {{which can be}} rescued by walking over, then escorting the <b>controlled</b> <b>character</b> to the exit point. If a player <b>controlled</b> <b>character</b> is killed, that character turns into a captive, except that they will disappear if the next active player <b>controlled</b> <b>character</b> dies, exits the level without them, or the player has no characters left in their party. In Hard mode, you start the game with all twenty characters, but all the captive characters are removed from the levels.|$|R
5000|$|A {{common use}} of escape {{sequences}} {{is in fact}} to remove <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> found in a binary data stream {{so that they will}} not cause their control function by mistake. In this case, the <b>control</b> <b>character</b> is replaced by a defined [...] "escape character" [...] (which need not be the US-ASCII escape character) and another character; after exiting the context where the <b>control</b> <b>character</b> would have caused an action, the sequence is recognized and replaced by the removed character. To transmit the [...] "escape character" [...] itself, two copies are sent.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, {{an escape}} {{character}} {{is not a}} particular case of (device) <b>control</b> <b>characters,</b> nor vice versa. If we define <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> as non-graphic, or as having a special meaning for an output device (e.g. printer or text terminal) then any escape character for this device is a control one. But escape characters used in programming (such as the backslash, [...] "\") are graphic, hence are not <b>control</b> <b>characters.</b> Conversely most (but not all) of the ASCII [...] "control characters" [...] have some control function in isolation, therefore are not escape characters.|$|R
