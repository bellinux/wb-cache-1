5|$|J. R. Miller, relying {{more and}} more on Pflueger's {{hard-working}} energy, social conviviality and artistic talent, gave him a wide variety of assignments including designs for an automobile showroom, a firehouse and a number of private homes. Pflueger extended his proposed styles to include Aztec elements and Spanish Colonial Revival themes, the latter favored by several <b>clients</b> <b>for</b> their homes.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin {{had hoped}} to read Classics at Merton College, Oxford, but the end of National Service in the United Kingdom meant there was more {{competition}} for university places. He was forced to consider other options. His parents discouraged the ideas he offered—an acting career or work in the Colonial Service in Kenya. Instead, Chatwin's father asked one of his <b>clients</b> <b>for</b> a letter of introduction to the auction house Sotheby's. An interview was arranged, and Chatwin secured a job there.|$|E
5|$|Enron's auditor firm, Arthur Andersen, {{was accused}} of {{applying}} reckless standards in its audits because of {{a conflict of interest}} over the significant consulting fees generated by Enron. During 2000, Arthur Andersen earned $25 million in audit fees and $27 million in consulting fees (this amount accounted for roughly 27% of the audit fees of public <b>clients</b> <b>for</b> Arthur Andersen's Houston office). The auditor's methods were questioned as either being completed solely to receive its annual fees or for its lack of expertise in properly reviewing Enron's revenue recognition, special entities, derivatives, and other accounting practices.|$|E

5|$|The V7 {{client is}} {{the seventh and}} latest {{generation}} of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior <b>clients</b> <b>for</b> Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. It was released on March22, 2012. Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low priority, allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients. V7 uses Trac for managing its bug tickets so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.|$|E
5|$|The team {{developing}} the Linux client {{had been working}} for a year before the announcement to validate that such a port would be possible. As of the official announcement, a near-feature-complete Steam client for Linux had been developed and successfully run on Ubuntu. Internal beta testing of the Linux client started in October 2012; external beta testing occurred in early November the same year. Open beta <b>clients</b> <b>for</b> Linux were made available in late December 2012, and the client was officially released in mid-February 2013. At the time of announcement, Valve's Linux division assured that its first game on the OS, Left 4 Dead 2, wpuld run at an acceptable frame rate and with a degree of connectivity with the Windows and OS X versions. From there, it began working on porting other games to Ubuntu and expanding to other Linux distributions. Linux games are also eligible for SteamPlay availability. Versions of Steam working under Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux were released by October 2013. By June 2014, the number of Linux-compatible games on Steam had reached over 500, surpassing over 1,000 by March 2015. A year later, this number doubled to over 2,000.|$|E
