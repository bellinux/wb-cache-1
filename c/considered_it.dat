5|$|Poe eschewed the {{scientific}} method in Eureka and instead wrote from pure intuition. For this reason, he <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> a work of art, not science, but insisted that it was still true and <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> to be his career masterpiece. Even so, Eureka is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions ignored Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets.|$|E
5|$|Another species {{complex in}} Attalea {{includes}} A.speciosa and related species. Henderson (1995) recognised A.speciosa and A.spectabilis, considering {{the latter to}} either be an acaulescent form of A.speciosa or a hybrid between it and A.microcarpa. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted A.spectabilis, but Glassman <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> a dubious taxon. Attalea vitrivir was recognised as a distinct species by Michael Balick and coauthors; Glassman and Govaerts and Dransfield concurred, but Henderson <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> part of A.speciosa. Glassman also described a fourth member of this group, A.brejinhoensis, and it is accepted by Govaerts and Dransfield.|$|E
5|$|German ornithologist Gustav Hartlaub {{separated}} the Madagascan {{population of the}} Mascarene martin as a full species, P.madagascariensis, but more recent authorities have <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> {{to be only a}} subspecies, P.b.madagascariensis.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was {{of the opinion that}} the name may not be as rare as some people have thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> possible that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think it could have been in the male-line.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg's theory {{centers on}} the notion that justice is the {{essential}} characteristic of moral reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to {{the short}} was positive, and reviewers of WALL-Es home media release <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> to be an enjoyable special feature. Presto was {{nominated}} for an Annie Award and Academy Award. It {{was included in the}} Animation Show of Shows in 2008.|$|E

50|$|The Baja {{pygmy owl}} or cape pygmy owl (Glaucidium hoskinsii) is a {{subspecies}} of northern pygmy owl {{restricted to the}} Mexican state of Baja California Sur. Although some taxonomists, including the International Ornithologists' Union, <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> to be a distinct species, other authorities, including the American Ornithological Society, do not <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> separate, and <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> to be a subspecies of the northern pygmy owl.|$|R
5000|$|Corobicí is an extinct Chibchan lect of Costa Rica. Many authors <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> a dialect of Guatuso; others <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> (or {{at least}} the words which are claimed to be {{recorded}} in it) as Rama.|$|R
5|$|Russia and Poland {{remained}} {{divided on}} the legal description of the Katyn crime. The Poles <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> a case of genocide and demanded further investigations, as well as complete disclosure of Soviet documents.|$|E
5|$|The {{cladistic}} analysis done by Selles and Galobart in 2015 recovered Cairanoolithus as {{a sister}} taxon to the clade of ornithopod eggs Guegoolithus, Spheroolithus, and Ovaloolithus. Therefore, they <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> likely that Cairanoolithus {{belongs to a}} non-ornithopod ornithischian dinosaur.|$|E

5|$|When {{the islanders}} were reproached with their ignorance or {{insensibility}} of {{the wonders of}} Staffa, they had not much to reply. They had indeed <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> little, because they had always seen it; and none but philosophers, nor they always, are struck with wonder otherwise than by novelty.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} was first described by Swiss paleontologist Louis Agassiz in 1844. He named the genus Stagonolepis from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in Elgin, Scotland, but <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> to be a Devonian fish {{rather than a}} Triassic reptile. This may be because he considered the strata {{to be part of}} the Old Red Sandstone, and thus Paleozoic in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were arranged in a similar pattern to those of gars. He also thought that these supposed scales were very similar to those of the lobe-finned fish Megalichthys due to their large size.|$|E

5|$|After this, Khrushchev {{made many}} desperate {{attempts}} to reconstitute the Sino-Soviet alliance, but Mao <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> useless and denied any proposal. The Chinese-Soviet animosity spilled {{out in an}} intra-communist propaganda war. Further on, the Soviets focused on a bitter rivalry with Mao's China for leadership of the global communist movement.|$|E
5|$|Alfre Woodard {{was cast}} as Lily Sloane, Cochrane's assistant. When Frakes {{first moved to}} Los Angeles, Woodard {{was one of the}} first people he met. During a {{conversation}} at a barbecue, Woodard said she would become Frakes' godmother, as he did not have one. Through this relationship, Frakes was able to cast Woodard in the film; he <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> a coup to land an Academy Award-nominated actress. Woodard considered Lily to be the character most like herself out of all the roles she has played.|$|E
5|$|Although the Dirty War {{ended in}} the eighties, Kirchner <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> an {{unresolved}} issue. In his inaugural speech, he supported human rights organizations which sought the incarceration of the military connected with the National Reorganization Process. He also ordered the top military leadership to retire. Kirchner sent a bill to the Congress to annul the full stop law and the Law of Due Obedience, which had halted trials of the military for crimes related to the Dirty War. The laws had been repealed in 1998, but that repeal had little legal significance, as only an annulment would reopen the cases. Although this initiative was opposed by Duhalde and Scioli, most legislators <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> a symbolic gesture since the laws' constitutionality would {{be decided by the}} Supreme Court. Both laws were annulled by the Congress in August 2003, and many cases were reopened as a result. The Supreme Court declared the laws, and Menem's presidential pardons, unconstitutional in 2005. Jorge Julio López, witness in a trial of police officer Miguel Etchecolatz, disappeared in 2006. This caused a national scandal, as it was suspected that he was disappeared to intimidate other witnesses in the upcoming trials, and the government was unable to locate him.|$|E

5|$|An early {{structural}} {{application of}} the Pythagorean tiling appears {{in the works of}} Leonardo da Vinci, who <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> among several other potential patterns for floor joists. This tiling has also long been used decoratively, for floor tiles or other similar patterns, as can be seen for instance in Jacob Ochtervelt's painting Street Musicians at the Doorway of a House (1665). It has been suggested that seeing a similar tiling in the palace of Polycrates may have provided Pythagoras with the original inspiration for his theorem.|$|E
5|$|Army Group North {{had already}} {{considered}} abandoning Estonia in February 1944, during the Soviet Kingisepp-Gdov Offensive. A {{large number of}} units would have been freed up with changes to the front, but the Narva front continued to be defended on Hitler's orders. The German Command <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> important to maintain control over the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland to ease the situation in Finland and keep the Soviet Baltic Fleet trapped in the eastern bay of the gulf. The retention of the oil shale reserves and oil shale industry in Ida-Viru was important for economic reasons.|$|E
