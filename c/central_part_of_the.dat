5|$|Animal {{entertainments}} {{formed a}} <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> games and normally {{took place in}} the morning. Dio says that {{over the course of the}} inaugural games upward of nine thousand tamed and wild animals were slain sometimes by women of no particular prominence. This conflicts with the work of Eutropius who wrote, in the later part of the fourth century, that 5,000 animals were slain during the games.|$|E
5|$|De Iniusta is {{actually}} a composite work. The account of the trial itself, often termed the Libellus, is the <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work, and is probably the original account. To the Libellus was added an introduction which summarises St-Calais' career prior to the trial. A conclusion which relates the bishop's life after the trial is appended {{to the end of}} the work. The introduction and conclusion are often referred to as the Vita, or Life.|$|E
5|$|Every {{year the}} Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts {{a series of}} surveys on its {{highways}} {{in the state to}} measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2009, WSDOT calculated that as few as 2,000cars traveled through the <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway, and as many as 2,500cars at the interchange with SR22.|$|E

5|$|Various {{parts of}} the main volcano have been {{subjected}} to hydrothermal alteration. The Azufrera stage edifice was subject to the most alteration; especially in the summit area and between the Angulo and Azufrera summits lie sulfur rich talus deposits. The <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex is heavily altered by fumarole activity. Hydrothermal alteration may be driven by the formation of a deep magma reservoir and resulting hydrothermal circulation in overlying rocks.|$|E

5|$|A <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{non-discrimination}} {{policy is}} the Mining Code of 7 August 1925. It is uncertain if the code is internationally binding, or {{if it can be}} amended unilaterally by Norway. Specifically, the commissioner issues licenses to search for minerals and state-owned and other owner's land and to register claims. To maintain a claim, the owner must work 1,500 man-hours per five years and pay an annual fee of 6,000 Norwegian krone. However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry may grant exceptions from the work obligation under specific conditions.|$|E
5|$|A <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show's premise {{was that}} the main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained {{that he did not}} want the character to be that young.|$|E
5|$|During the war era, Nguyễn Ánh had {{maintained}} an embryonic bureaucracy {{in an attempt}} to prove his leadership ability to the people. Due to the incessant warfare, military officers were generally the most prominent members of his inner circle. This dependency on military backing continued to manifest itself throughout his reign. Vietnam was divided into three administrative regions. The old patrimony of the Nguyễn formed the <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empire (vùng Kinh Kỳ), with nine provinces, five of which were directly ruled by Gia Long and his mandarins from Huế.|$|E

5|$|Green Creek rises near Waller {{and heads}} roughly south to Rohrsburg {{and on to}} Orangeville, where it joins Fishing Creek. It drains the <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fishing Creek watershed. Little Fishing Creek starts just in Lycoming County near the Columbia County Line. It winds through rural areas before {{reaching}} Pennsylvania Route 42, which it runs parallel to {{for the remainder of}} its length. It drains {{the western part of the}} Fishing Creek watershed. Four covered bridges cross Little Fishing Creek; these are the Wanich Covered Bridge No. 69, the Sam Eckman Covered Bridge No. 92, the Jud Christie Covered Bridge No. 95, and the Creasyville Covered Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Highway16 is {{a provincial}} paved highway in the Canadian {{province}} of Saskatchewan. It is the Saskatchewan {{section of the}} Yellowhead Highway, and also the Trans-Canada Highway Yellowhead section. The main purpose of this highway is to connect Saskatchewan with Canadian cities such as Edmonton and Winnipeg. The highway runs from the Alberta boundary in Lloydminster (50thAvenue or Highway17) to the Manitoba boundary near Marchwell. Major cities it passes through are Saskatoon, North Battleford in the <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province, Yorkton {{in the far east}} and Lloydminster to the far west.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 {{an island}} {{was found in}} the <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake. Then, in January 2006, the {{discovery}} of two nearby smaller lakes under the ice cap was published; they are named 90 Degrees East and Sovetskaya. It is suspected that these Antarctic subglacial lakes may be connected by a network of subglacial rivers. Centre for Polar Observation & Modelling glaciologists propose that many of the subglacial lakes of Antarctica are at least temporarily interconnected. Because of varying water pressure in individual lakes, large subsurface rivers may suddenly form and then force large amounts of water through the solid ice.|$|E
