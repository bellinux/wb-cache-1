40|$|Abstract – The rural {{distribution}} transformer <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> due to lightning activity {{is a critical}} matter in several regions of Colombia. Different research projects have been funded by Colombian electrical companies in order to solve this problem. In some colombian regions, such as Rionegro, Cundinamarca, the tramsformer <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> has been as high as 50 %. In different {{places around the world}} with a lightning activity similar to our country, the <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> has been kept close to 1 %. The problem could be solved by developing an integral solution that includes: reduction of grounding resistance and inductive loops, specific transformer design and extensive use of surge arresters on the low and medium voltage transformer windings. The hygroscopic properties of granular materials against lightning-like current and voltage impulses were used to develop an economic surge protection device based on sand. The transformers with the highest <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> were selected to install this new type of surge protection device.

Results Tracings of 76 pediatric patients (32 males; 9. 1 +/- 0. 7 years) and 25 healthy adult controls (7 males; 36. 1 +/- 2. 2 years) were analyzed. Patients mostly had normal motility (50 %) or a category 4 disorder and usually weak peristalsis (31. 5 %) according to the Chicago Classification. PFA of healthy controls defined reference ranges for PFI <= 142 and impedance ratio <= 0. 49. Pediatric patients with pressure-flow (PF) characteristics within these limits had normal motility (62 %), most patients with PF characteristics outside these limits also had an abnormal Chicago Classification (61 %). Patients with high PFI and disordered motor patterns all had esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction.

40|$|An even {{distribution}} of preservatives is favoured as non-impregnated parts of wood {{will lead to}} a less durable material. Plenty of factors could be the reasons for the observed un{{even distribution}} of preservatives, such as wood products dimension, moisture content, drying process, wood extractives and structure. In this study, the influence of drying conditions, extractives and wood structure to uneven distribution of preservatives was studied. 294 Scots pine (Pinus Sylvestris) boards were treatment with copper based preservatives. The boards were kiln dried under two different drying temperatures (dry temperature was 60 and 80 °C, respectively) to three different target MC (10 - 12, 18 and 24 %). Before drying and impregnation, green and dried test samples (2 × 400 mm) from these boards were taken and stored in freezer at - 24 °C, respectively. The total <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> (boards which have failure/total boards) was 31 %. The highest <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> occurred in group whose drying temperature was 80 oC and MC was 13. 8 %, and the minimum <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> occurred group whose drying temperature was 80 oC and MC was 20. 2 %. Quantitative analysis of extractives on matched impregnated and umimpregnated areas of dried and green samples were done by GC-FID. The microstructure of wood on the areas with impregnation failures was also studied by SEM. The results showed that fatty acids, resin acids and fats could {{play an important role in}} explaining uneven distribution of preservatives. The areas with impregnation failures contained more fatty acids, resin acids and fats than impregnated areas on dried samples. Those extractives could block resin canal as well as parenchyma cells which will hinder liquid penetration. Also, the drying process has an influence to presence of fatty acids, resin acids and fats, which could well explain the impregnation <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> of the whole batch. In addition, the influence of reconditioning to uneven distribution of preservatives was investigated with the help of CT-scanner.

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the limited}} {{transmission}} resources for data relay in the tracking and data relay satellite system (TDRSS), there are many job requirements in busy days which will be discarded in the conventional job scheduling model. Therefore, the improvement of scheduling efficiency in the TDRSS can not only help to increase the resource utilities, but also to reduce the scheduling <b>failure</b> <b>ratio.</b> A model of nonhomogeneous parallel machines scheduling prob-lems with time window (NPM-TW) is firstly built up for the TDRSS, considering the distinct features of the variable preparation time and the nonhomogeneous transmission rates for different types of antennas on each tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS). Then, an adaptive subsequence adjustment (ASA) framework with evo-lutionary asymmetric path-relinking (EvAPR) is proposed to solve this problem, in which an asymmetric progressive crossover ope-ration is involved to overcome the local optima by the conventional job inserting methods.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} efficient approximate learning by multilayered feedforward circuits subject to two objective functions. First, we {{consider the}} objective to maximize the ratio of correctly classified points compared to the training set size (e. g., see [3, 5]). We show that for single hidden layer threshold circuits with n hidden nodes and varying input dimension, approximation of this ratio within a relative error c/n 3, for some positive constant c,is NP-hard even {{if the number of}} examples is limited with respect to n. For architectures with two hidden nodes (e. g., as in [6]), approximating the objective within some fixed factor is NP-hard even if any sigmoid-like activation function in the hidden layer and ε-separation of the output [19] is considered, or if the semilinear activation function substitutes the threshold function. Next, we consider the objective to minimize the <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> [2]. We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> within every constant larger than 1 for a multilayered threshold circuit provided the input biases are zero. Furthermore, even weak approximation of this objective is almost NP-hard. ...|$|R
