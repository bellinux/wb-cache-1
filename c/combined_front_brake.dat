5000|$|The 1968 Mark IV Spitfire was {{the last}} year of the 'Mark' Spitfires made. Amal's Concentric carburetors were <b>combined</b> with twin-leading-shoe <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> and {{independently}} adjustable Lucas ignition points for easier starting and tuning. Engine power output was increased to [...] A total of 1291 true 1968 model year Spitfires were produced, not counting the 478 'hybrid' 1968 Spitfires that have 1967 style numbers. The 'hybrids' were dispatched in March to May 1968 {{near the end of the}} 1968 model year.|$|R
25|$|The {{rear linkage}} {{mechanism}} {{is complicated by}} the need to allow rotation where the fork and handlebars attach to the frame. A common setup was to <b>combine</b> a <b>front</b> rod <b>brake</b> with a rear coaster brake. Although heavy and complex, the linkages are reliable and durable and can be repaired or adjusted with simple hand tools. The design is still in use, typically on African and Asian roadsters such as the Sohrab and Flying Pigeon.|$|R
50|$|A bicycle's <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> lever is {{typically}} {{installed on the}} side of the handlebar closest to the center of the road (front-left for right-side driving). In many countries, the hand signal for stopping/braking requires that the cyclist signal with the hand used for the <b>front</b> <b>brake.</b> The <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> is the most effective method of stopping a bike under normal road conditions.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> are two-piston design, {{while the}} single rear caliper houses four pistons. Both <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{activated}} {{by the right}} hand lever. The rear brake is activated by the foot pedal on the right.|$|R

5000|$|Since 1996 {{the brake}} {{specification}} {{has gone from}} a single <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> disc 300 mm in carbon steel to a single brake in carbon, with a diameter of 275 mm disc; in 2000 the bike returned to a double disc <b>front</b> <b>braking</b> system [...]|$|R
50|$|Slidepad is an Intelligent Brake Distribution (IBD) technology, {{aimed at}} making braking easier for novice or casual cyclists, {{integrates}} into V-brake systems to provide single-lever braking. It modulates the <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> force in real time, {{based on the}} road surface and rider weight position, and avoids front wheel lockup accidents when applying the <b>front</b> <b>brake.</b> It was designed to prevent riders from flipping over their handlebars when applying the <b>front</b> <b>brake.</b> Once the brake pads {{make contact with the}} rear wheel, the Slidepad slides forward, which pulls a cable that is connected to the <b>front</b> <b>brakes.</b> Similar to the anti-lock brake system in cars, the mechanism prevents the front wheel from locking, no matter how hard the brake is pressed or how slippery the road conditions are.|$|R
50|$|The chassis with MacPherson strut {{front and}} {{multilink}} rear suspension was {{common to all}} S13 and RS13 models. The European 200SX initially had 257mm <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> and rear disc service brakes with drum parking brakes in the rotor hubs. Later models had larger 280mm <b>front</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The alloy wheels were spoked {{and wore}} tubed tyres. The <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> had twin 230 mm disks and ATE callipers; the rear brake was a 200 mm SLS drum. The R90S {{and the other}} BMW [...] "/6" [...] series <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> had an unusual system whereby a master {{cylinder}} on the top frame tube was activated by a cable from the <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> lever. This arrangement was supposed to protect the master cylinder {{in the event of}} a crash; but later [...] "/7" [...] machines adopted a conventional handlebar-mounted Brembo master cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are solid}} disks, and the rears are drum brakes. The AE86 has {{ventilated}} <b>front</b> disk <b>brakes</b> on the GT-Apex, GT-S, GT-V, and GT models, but has solid rear disks. The North American AE86 SR-5 also features solid <b>front</b> disk <b>brakes,</b> with drum type brakes at the rear.|$|R

50|$|A {{variety of}} options is {{commonly}} found on flatland bikes. The most unifying feature of flatland bikes {{is the use}} of four pegs, one on the end of each wheel axle. Flatlanders will choose to run a <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> (or a dual front brake; one <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> with two brake levers using one <b>brake</b> cable), <b>front</b> and rear <b>brakes,</b> or no brakes at all, depending on stylistic preference.|$|R

2500|$|The motion {{dynamics}} of a bicycle {{will cause a}} transfer of weight to the <b>front</b> wheel during <b>braking,</b> improving the traction on the front wheel. If too much power {{is applied to the}} <b>front</b> <b>brake,</b> momentum may cause the rider and bike to flip over - a type of crash sometimes called an [...] "endo". The skidding of the rear wheel can serve as a signal to reduce force on the <b>front</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|R

50|$|BMW Motorrad uses {{a system}} called Integral ABS, {{in which the}} <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> lever {{operates}} both the <b>front</b> and rear <b>brakes,</b> while the brake pedal operates only the rear brake. In the inverse, Honda's system that features both combined brakes and anti-lock brakes is dubbed Combined ABS. In this system, the rear brake pedal operates both <b>front</b> and rear <b>brake,</b> and the <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> lever operates the front calipers, which in turn activates a secondary master cylinder to engage the rear brake. ABS modulators are installed on both {{the front and rear}} wheel.|$|R
50|$|Modified <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> {{calipers}} {{with improved}} seals taken into use early in model year.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the bicycle}} rider {{does not have}} a <b>front</b> <b>brake,</b> then {{experienced}} riders may jam a foot in between the tire and front fork while pushing forward. Stoppies can also be accomplished without <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> {{with the aid of a}} roadside curb. If the bike's wheels are 24" [...] or larger they will normally mount the curb instead of being stopped by it.|$|R
50|$|Shock {{absorbers}} were fitted all round. <b>Front</b> <b>braking</b> was now by <b>brakes</b> on the <b>front</b> wheels.|$|R
5000|$|October: Suzuki recalls 210,228 {{motorcycles}} in the U.S. {{because the}} <b>front</b> <b>brakes</b> {{might not work}} properly.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, trail braking is done {{exclusively}} with the <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> even though trailing the rear brake will effectively slow the motorcycle, also decreasing the turning radius. If the motorcycle is leaned over, {{forces from the}} <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> and the deceleration causes the motorcycle to yaw (lean), while use of the rear brake generates a torque that tends to align (straighten) and stabilize the motorcycle.|$|R
50|$|Motorcycle {{braking systems}} have varied {{throughout}} time, as motorcycles evolved from bicycles with an engine attached, to the 220 mph prototype motorcycles seen racing in MotoGP. Most systems work by converting kinetic energy into thermal energy (heat) by friction. On motorcycles, approximately 70% of the braking effort is {{performed by the}} <b>front</b> <b>brake.</b> This however can vary for individual motorcycles; longer-wheelbase types having more weight biased rearward, such as cruisers and tourers, can have a`greater effort applied by the rear brake. In contrast, sports bikes with a shorter wheelbase and more vertical fork geometry can tolerate higher <b>front</b> <b>braking</b> loads. For these reasons, motorcycles {{tend to have a}} vastly more powerful <b>front</b> <b>brake</b> compared to the rear.|$|R
