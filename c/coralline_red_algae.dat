40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{an unusual}} encrusting calcareous organism found growing on upper intertidal rocks {{along the coast}} of the Minas Basin, Nova Scotia, Canada, which was thought to potentially represent a new, perhaps invasive species to the area. Methods: Observations were made of the organism growing in situ and of intact and dissected specimens under microscopes in the laboratory. Taxonomic keys were used to determine probable identity of the organism as a tunicate, sponge, bryozoan, marine lichen, or <b>coralline</b> <b>red</b> <b>alga.</b> These keys were then further used to identify samples to species. Results: The organism was determined to be Phymatolithon lamii (Me. Lemoine) Y. M. Chamberlain 1991, an encrusting <b>coralline</b> <b>red</b> <b>alga</b> native to the study region. This species normally occurs in the subtidal zone, so its occurrence in the high intertidal zone was unusual and resulted in the alga becoming bleached and taking on an unusual appearance. Conclusions: The sample did not represent a new or invasive species to the study area. However, occurrence of this species on the high intertidal zone was novel and may have resulted from unusual climatic and/or oceanographic conditions in the study area in 2015 that allowed this alga to settle and grow in the intertidal zone for a time before death and bleaching occurred.

5000|$|Marl or marlstone is a calcium {{carbonate}} or lime-rich mud or mudstone which contains variable amounts of clays and silt. The dominant carbonate mineral in most marls is calcite, but other carbonate minerals such as aragonite, dolomite, and siderite may be present. Marl was originally an old term loosely {{applied to a}} variety of materials, most of which occur as loose, earthy deposits consisting chiefly of an intimate mixture of clay and {{calcium carbonate}}, formed under freshwater conditions; specifically an earthy substance containing 35-65% clay and 65-35% carbonate.

It has a blocky subconchoidal fracture, and is less fissile than shale.

50|$|The rhodolithic {{growth habit}} has been {{attained}} {{by a number}} of unrelated <b>coralline</b> <b>red</b> <b>algae,</b> organisms that deposit calcium carbonate within their cell walls to form hard structures that closely resemble beds of coral. Unlike coral, rhodoliths do not attach themselves to the rocky seabed. Rather, they roll like tumbleweeds along the seafloor until they become too large in size to be mobilised by the prevailing wave and current regime. They may then become incorporated into a semi-continuous algal mat. While corals are animals that are both autotrophic (photosynthesize via their symbionts) or heterotrophic (filter plankton from the water for food), rhodoliths produce energy solely through photosynthesis (i.e. they can only grow and survive in the shallow photic zone of the ocean). Scientists believe rhodoliths have been present in the world's oceans since at least the Eocene epoch, some 55 million years ago.|$|E

40|$|Marine {{ecosystems}} {{are threatened by}} CO 2 -driven global change, such as ocean warming and acidification (OA). The primary objectives {{of this study were}} to: 1) assess the response of the <b>coralline</b> <b>red</b> <b>alga,</b> Calliarthron cheilosporioides, to global change; and 2) investigate the responses of California’s kelp forest communities to OA and sea urchin grazing. Results indicated that C. cheilosporioides growth and calcification were reduced under both increased temperatures and increased pCO 2 despite increased photosynthetic rates in high pCO 2 conditions. Mineralogy did not differ among treatments as a function of warming or acidification. Differences were observed in Mg incorporation into calcified walls of different cell types. Impacts of OA and sea urchin grazing on community structure differed in central and southern CA. In central CA, community structure, calcification and juvenile kelp density showed strong effects of grazing, but no effect of pCO 2. Conversely, southern CA showed minor effects of grazing, but strong effects of pCO 2 on community structure and calcification, with the strength of response depending on the initial assemblage. These findings suggest that some species of coralline algae may be negatively affected by increased pCO 2 and temperature and that the emergent effects of ocean acidification may differ both within a reef as well as across broad spatial scales...|$|R
50|$|Crustose is a {{habit of}} some types of algae and lichens in which the plant grows tightly appressed to a {{substrate}} forming a biological layer of the adhering organism. Crustose adheres very closely to the substrates at all points. Crustose is found on rocks and tree bark.5 Some species of marine algae of the Rhodophyta, in particular members of the order Corallinales, family Corallinaceae, subfamily Melobesioideae with cell walls containing calcium carbonate grow to great depths in the intertidal zone, forming crusts on various substrates.

50|$|One of {{the largest}} {{potential}} threats of ocean acidification to marine invertebrates is the corrosive properties of undersaturated waters with respect to calcium carbonate skeletons/shells, and a theoretical inability to calcify under these conditions. Ocean acidification is a lowered pH of ocean waters caused by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, which results in more CO2 dissolving into the ocean. This {{poses a threat to}} corals and calcifying macroalgae, two main calcifying groups that occur in reefs, as well as other shelled organisms and the organisms that depend on them. Corals and calcifying macroalgae such as <b>coralline</b> <b>red</b> <b>algae</b> and calcifying green algae are extremely sensitive to ocean acidification because they build their hard structures out of calcium carbonate. The sinking pH of ocean waters makes it difficult for these shelled creatures to produce enough calcium carbonate to build and maintain their skeletal structures. Echinoderms, such as sea stars and sea urchins, and mollusks, including squid and clams, as well as many other species are also at risk because of thinning shells and weakened skeletal structures. By targeting calcifying organisms, ocean acidification threatens the health of reef ecosystems as a whole.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. A taxonomic and biostratigraphical re-assessment of Subterraniphyllum Elliott (Corallinales, Rhodophyta) is presented.

Alizarin red S staining was used to mark 43 rhodolith branches and helped determine extension rates over the rhodoliths' last living year. A combination of radiocarbon dating, major Mg/Ca ratio cycles and growth band determinations provided a chronological approach to characterise extension rates for 5 branches over the last 5 decades. A seasonal asymmetry in the extension rates was observed, with higher extension during the austral summer-fall-winter period, indicating that variations in ambient seawater temperature are not of major influence in the seasonal growth pattern of S. durum. At the sub-seasonal level, minor growth bands were observed with a maximum frequency of 14 d but were too variable to {{be considered as a}} reliable chronological tool. The concordance of the results from both the monitoring experiment over the year 2010 to 2011 and the chronological approach applied to the period 1968 to 2008 suggests that an extension rate (mean +/- SD) of 0. 6 +/- 0. 2 mm yr(- 1) is typical of the S. durum community at the study site. However, annual extension rates varied considerably among branches and individuals. Long-term trends still appeared, such as a decrease during the early 1970 s attributed to the impact of mining activity. A slight but consistent decrease was observed in the annual extension rates throughout the record and may reflect an ontogenic effect potentially enhanced by reduced light penetration due to increasing suspended particulate matter in the water column...|$|R
