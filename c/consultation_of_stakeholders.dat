The reform was implemented {{under the umbrella of}} the One UN programme, which had been launched the previous year, inspired by a report by a high-level task force proposing that the United Nations focus on Delivering as One. Within the One UN programme, several United Nations agencies worked together to formulate joint programmes for each of the eight pilot countries, with funding originating mainly from the One UN Fund. Tanzania was one of these eight pilot countries. (The One UN programme has since become the United Nations Development Assistance Programme.)UNESCO’s participation in the One UN Programme for Tanzania came in response to the request made by the President, His Excellency Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, for UNESCO’s assistance in conducting a comprehensive review of Tanzania's first National Science and Technology Policy (1996), in a June 2007 letter to UNESCO’s Director-General. In August 2007, the heads of UN agencies agreed to UNESCO’s proposal for science components {{to be included in the}} One UN programme for Tanzania, in support of the government’s Vision 2025 (1998) objective of ‘transforming the economy into a strong, resilient and competitive one, buttressed by science and technology’. Peter Msolla, Tanzanian Minister of Communications, Science and Technology, told fellow ministers attending the High-level Segment of the meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission on 1 July 2008 that, ‘without a dose of innovation Tanzania, the macro-economic gains achieved over the years through the implementation of sound economic policies would be wiped out.’ ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Governmental {{organizations}} are facing challenges in adjusting procedures providing equitable assistance to consumers with amputation choosing newly available osseointegrated fixations for bone-anchored prostheses (BAPs) over socket-suspended prostheses. Objectives: The aims {{of this study}} were to (1) present a procedure focusing on tasks, documents and costs of prosthetic care, and (2) share observed obstacles and facilitators to implementation. Methods: This research aimed at developing a governmental procedure for the provision of BAPs was designed as an action research study. A total of 18 individuals with transfemoral amputation solely funded by a Queensland State organization were considered. Results: The procedure, developed between January 2011 and June 2015, included seven processes involving fixed expenses during treatment and five processes regulating ongoing prosthetic care expenses. Prosthetic care required 22 h of labor, corresponding to AUD$ 3300 per patient, during rehabilitation. Prosthetists spend 64 and 36 % of their time focusing on prosthetic care and other activities, respectively. The procedure required adjustments related to the scope of practice of prosthetists, funding of prosthetic limbs during rehabilitation, and allocation of microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knees. Approximately 41 % (7) and 59 % (10) of obstacles were within (e. g. streamlining systematic processes, sustaining evaluation of this complex procedure) or outside (e. g. early and consistent <b>consultations</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakeholders,</b> lack <b>of</b> a definitive rehabilitation program) governmental control, respectively, and approximately 89 % (17) of the facilitators were within governmental control (e. g. adapting existing processes).

40|$|This {{test method}} was {{developed}} by the National Research Council Canada (NRC) to determine the initial performance of indoor passive panel technologies (IPPT) in their removal of formaldehyde and toluene gas as well as assess re-emissions of captured gases and harmful by-product formation. This new protocol builds on existing sorption-based standards to evaluate performance of both sorptive- and PCO-based IPPT in removing indoor formaldehyde and toluene. Considering that some PCO-based IPPT may be influenced by sorptive effect, this new protocol differentiates removal performance attributed to light illumination and sorption. This protocol uses an improved chamber with proper control of air velocity and turbulence level to simulate indoor conditions instead of a photoreactor chamber. In addition, the chamber utilises indoor lighting (as opposed to UV) as a source of illumination to better represent indoor applications. By testing by-product formation, this new protocol is the first to address protection of building occupants to harmful pollutant exposures. The project was funded by the Government of Canada 2 ̆ 019 s Clean Air Regulatory Agenda to develop three protocols for evaluating the effectiveness of 2 ̆ 01 cIAQ Solutions 2 ̆ 01 d.

40|$|Abstract Background Reducing {{the burden}} of disease relies on {{availability}} of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). There is limited data on availability, quality and content of guidelines within the Southern African Development Community (SADC). This evaluation aims to address this gap in knowledge and provide recommendations for regional guideline development. Methods We prioritised five diseases: HIV in adults, malaria in children and adults, pre-eclampsia, diarrhoea in children and hypertension in primary care. A comprehensive electronic search to locate guidelines was conducted between June and October 2010 and augmented with email contact with SADC Ministries of Health. Independent reviewers used the AGREE II tool to score six quality domains reporting the guideline development process. Alignment of the evidence-base of the guidelines was evaluated by comparing their content with key recommendations from accepted reference guidelines, identified with a content expert, and percentage scores were calculated. Findings We identified 30 guidelines from 13 countries, publication dates ranging from 2003 - 2010. Overall the ' scope and purpose' and ' clarity and presentation' domains of the AGREE II instrument scored highest, median 58 %(range 19 - 92) and 83 %(range 17 - 100) respectively. ' Stakeholder involvement' followed with median 39 %(range 6 - 75). ' Applicability', ' rigour of development' and ' editorial independence' scored poorly, all below 25 %. Alignment with evidence was variable across member states, the lowest scores occurring in older guidelines or where the guideline being evaluated was part of broader primary healthcare CPG rather than a disease-specific guideline. Conclusion This review identified quality gaps and variable alignment with best evidence in available guidelines within SADC for five priority diseases. Future guideline development processes within SADC should better adhere to global reporting norms requiring broader <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakeholders</b> and transparency of process.

A Unesco report affirms the role of engineering as driver of innovation, social and economic development, but emphasises the need to transform engineering education to give more attention to a problem-solving approach. The Community Service Engineer (CSE) project starts from experience with the CERA Award. The CERA award is an existing concept that bridges between technological challenges in the social profit sector and master thesis work of engineering students. Two notable results are observed:(1) The social profit sector has benefitted from the skills of engineers, (2) Engineers have been more successful when t 11 ey better understood the needs of people and organisations their engineering projects serve. The CSE project is developing a European multi-campus joined curriculum that will offer engineers: a sound background in the social profit sector; insights in human-centred design, focusing on end users; thorough insights in assistive technology; practical experience in real settings; more social and intercultural skills to interact with the social profit sector; and a collaborative place to learn in an international environment. The project team is currently putting together the curriculum, based on a broad <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakeholders.</b> The first try out starts in October 2013. For the practical experience CSE builds on the CERA Award experience. Engineering students select a probl 1 am, listen to the needs and translate the problem into technological questions and solutions. Associated partners (enterprises, chambers of commerce) are involved as link to the market. Via these channels students look for existing technology and translate it for use within the social profit sector. At the final stage, compendia of project results are communicated through the communication channels of the associated partners to screen market potential. Throughout the CSE course, students will be confronted with students from other disciplines, countries and age (secondary level) to present project results and interact. CSE will start as postgraduate course and work towards translation into undergraduate engineering curricula and a networked learning environment. Design objects include: instruction, fostering reflection and critical thinking, creating access to resources, networks and ecologies.

In this paper, we discuss current work in stakeholder identification, propose an approach to identifying relevant stakeholders for a specific system, and propose future directions for the work. 1. What is a ÔstakeholderÕ? There is a large body of literature in the strategic management area which discusses organisations in terms <b>of</b> a <b>stakeholder</b> model. Stakeholder analysis, it is claimed, can be used to analyse an organisationÕs performance and determine its future strategic direction. An oft-quoted definition of ÔstakeholderÕ, taken from a key reference in this literature is: ÔA stakeholder in an organisation is (by definition) any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organisationÕs objectives. Õ [10] A much broader definition, which has also been attributed to Freeman, is that a stakeholder is Ôanything influencing or influenced byÕ the firm, but it has been claimed that this definition is problematic because it leads to the identification of a very broad set <b>of</b> <b>stakeholders.</b> It is important to distinguish between influencers and stakeholders because while some potential stakeholders may indeed be both stakeholders and influencers, some who have a real stake in an enterprise may have no influence, e. g. a job applicant, while some influencers may have no stake, e. g. the media [8]...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change will}} place {{increasing}} {{pressure on the}} functioning of agricultural and natural areas in the Netherlands. Strategies to adapt these areas to stress are likely to require changes in landscape structure and management. In densely populated countries such as the Netherlands, the increased pressure of climate change on agricultural and natural areas will inevitably lead, through the necessity of spatial adaptation measures, to spatial conflicts between the sectors of agriculture and nature. An integrated approach to climate change adaptation may therefore be beneficial in limiting such sectoral conflicts. We explored the conflicting and synergistic properties of different climate adaptation strategies for agricultural and natural environments in the Netherlands. To estimate the feasibility and effectiveness of the strategies, we focussed on three case study regions with contrasting landscape structural, natural and agricultural characteristics. For each region, we estimated the expected climaterelated threats and associated trade-offs for arable farming and natural areas for 2040. We describe a number of spatial and integrated adaptation strategies to mitigate these threats. Formulating adaptation strategies requires <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> different <b>stakeholders</b> and deliberation between different interests.

40|$|Increased {{interest}} in the issue of evaluation of public policies {{dates back to the}} 1990 s. This was partly due to budget stringency and the need to better allocate increasingly scarce public resources. More fundamentally, however, the focus on evaluation was emblematic of a broader reassessment and examination of the appropriate role of government and of market mechanisms across a number of policy areas. Accountability, transparency and the desire to minimise distortions arising from government policies while maximising their leverage effect were all driving this trend towards more evaluations (Papaconstantinou and Polt, 1997, p. 9). The aim of this Chapter is to define impact assessment and to position ex-post impact assessment - the focus of this work - in the broader activity of evaluation. The concept of ‘impact’ and methodological difficulties related to its measurement are highlighted. The focus of the Chapter is on the practice of impact assessment in Europe and particular attention is paid to the place of ex-post IA in the policy cycle. Like ex-post evaluation in the 1990 s, ex-post impact assessment is currently enjoying increased attention. Assessing the socio-economic impacts of public policy is becoming increasingly important as the changing role and position of government has resulted in a growing demand for evidence-based policies (OECD, 2007, p. 4). In the field of RTDI, expectations from public policies have increased along with public funding. As a result, impact assessment is being increasingly called for. Once the decision has been made to conduct a new policy, this should be done in the best possible way. Government intervention is {{based on the idea that}} it can remedy some of the aforementioned market failures. But government intervention itself can also fail and social costs may end up higher than social benefits. Examples include institutional inertia, a lack of reliable information (e. g. on the impact of policies), a lack of continuity and a long-term perspective, excessive red tape, bureaucratic rivalry, unintended side effects, and so on. Therefore, the benefits of solving market failures must exceed the costs of government failure. First, a careful choice has to be made as to the area of intervention. The combination of finite resources and a multitude of new emerging research opportunities mean that careful attention must be paid to funding priorities and requires wise choices by policy-makers. Is R&D support provided across the board, to all S&T areas, or is it concentrated in a smaller number of S&T priorities, and if so which ones? Is R&D support provided in research infrastructure, basic research, applied research, and human resources too, or is it concentrated in a single or just a few components of the innovation system, and if so which ones? Second, the right choice has to be made as to the instrument of intervention. A wide range of possible instruments have emerged since the shift from the linear to the innovation systems paradigm. Governments make use of a flexible and evolving toolkit of instruments adapting to the specific dynamics and composition of the innovation system and addressing existing bottlenecks in the system. Third, care should be taken not to introduce an excessive number of different instruments and to maintain clear and understandable policy intervention logic. Consistency across instruments should also be ensured (policy mix). Different instruments can work together to alleviate a particular problem, or they can counteract each other, sometimes in unanticipated ways. Finally and closely related to the third point, policy support has to be provided at the most appropriate level of governance, and consistency in support has to be ensured across all policy levels. In a world that is increasingly interlinked, government measures will generate effects that go beyond the sheer local, regional and national level. Multi-level governance means finding the most optimal combination of government intervention at all policy levels in order to create synergies which none of the policy actors will be able to achieve on their own. From the above it is clear that, prior to public intervention, government must carefully design the way in which it will intervene. This will help to ensure that R&D support is provided in the most appropriate areas (with large spill-over effects and where the private sector would not get involved on its own) and through the most effective instruments. A wide range of tools are available to optimise the research policy formulation process. These include the comparative analysis of S&T input and output indicators, foresight and technological assessment analysis, the benchmarking of national R&D policy actions and instruments, growth and competitiveness analysis, the <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakeholders,</b> the ex-post evaluation and impact assessment of past R&D programmes, and the take-up of the feedback thereof in ex-ante evaluation/impact assessment. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Changes in the {{healthcare}} sector make hospitals more responsible for their investment decisions. There {{is a need to}} focus more on the investment decision making process and to determine the consequences of these investments. For this reason, this thesis discusses the ways in which a model is developed to assist the real estate decision making process regarding the investment opportunities at the UMCG. The goal of the thesis was to: Develop a model by which decisions, regarding investments in the real estate at the UMCG, can be made. From this goal, two central questions were derived. The first focuses on the method used in the model: What {{is the best way to}} analyse investment opportunities to serve as the foundation of the model and that fits with the UMCG and its surroundings? The second question focuses on the development and working of the model itself: In which way can a model be developed that assists the decision making process for real estate projects at the UMCG? Method Literature study, <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakeholders</b> and testing the model. The literature study focuses on the methods of investment decisions that exist within the academic community. Stakeholders were consulted to discuss the progress thus far, to list possible improvements and to obtain information. When the model was developed and applied to an old case, the future users of the model tested it to see if the model and the manual that supports the model were understandable and usable. Results The literature provided information for comparison of three different methods of analysing investment opportunities: the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Real Options Analysis (ROA) and Direct Capitalisation (DC). The DCF method was favoured, mainly because it is accurate and easily understandable. This last argument allows the model to be used by financial and non-financial persons. The Net Present Value (NPV) of all possible different alternatives was given as output and was compared to each other to determine the best alternative. This NPV lists the total present value of all the cash flows during the lifespan of a project. The Weighted Average cost of Capital (WACC) is the weighted average between the cost of debt and cost of equity and was used to determine the discount factor. Calculating this for the UMCG resulted in a WACC of 6, 07 %. The input consists out of the operational income and expenses, the initial investment income or expenses and the duration of the project. The output was given by the NPV and a sensitivity analysis to see what happens if the revenues rise of fall up to 5 %. An important feature of the model was its flexibility so it can be used for real estate investments for any project within the UMCG. The model was applied to a current case where the psychiatric department for adults (UCP) and children (UCKJP) need new housing. Please note that the absolute values of the NPVs contain a large degree of uncertainty, because the allocating of the Academisch Component en Rijksbijdrage (AC&R) and the overhead expenses may not be fully accurate. Any improvements that are done to make these input parameters more reliable would greatly improve the accuracy of the NPV. This lack of accuracy on the NPV was not a great problem since the main function of the model is to compare different alternatives and the uncertain input was the same for each alternative. This means that the ranking of the alternatives remains the same regardless of the height of the AC&R and overhead expenses. Another limitation was that the model can only list options that are available now, not ones that may come available in the future. This limits the number of alternatives that can be listed. Further improvements on this matter can be made by expanding the model to include option or decision trees that can list all possible options. Conclusion The best way to analyse investment opportunities to serve as the foundation of the model and that fits with the UMCG and its surroundings is to use the DCF method in which the NPV is used as output. The WACC is used to determine the discount factor. By listing the requirements of the model, the input and output parameters became clear. Applying the model to a case and testing it by the future users showed that the model works as it should. Further improvements to the model can be made by finding a better peer group when calculating the WACC, using option trees to add flexibility and improving the allocation of certain centralized budgets. ...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of DaCoTA WP 1, an Experts Panel was created and a consultation was launched for the preliminary assessment of knowledge, data and analysis needs within road safety management. The objective of the consultation of this Experts Panel was the assessment of current needs for evidence-based road safety decision making in the European countries, to be used also by other DaCoTA activities. In particular, {{it was intended to}} identify specific needs for knowledge, data and tools, which will be taken into account {{for the development of a}} data warehouse (DaCoTA WP 3) and for the creation of useful and relevant road safety decision support tools (DaCoTA WP 4). Moreover, this preliminary consultation of the Experts Panel serves as a first step towards the full assessment of current practices and future needs of knowledge-based road safety management, which will be carried out later on within DaCoTA WP 1 by means of a broader <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakeholders.</b> The members of the Experts Panel included members of the CARE National Experts group of the European Commission, as well as persons within the national road safety administration or scientific community of each country suggested by the National Experts. The Panel was complemented with additional persons suggested by the DaCoTA partners. The Panel eventually covers 20 EU Member States and 3 other European countries with different histories and experiences of RS management. The Experts have in-depth knowledge of road safety management processes and needs in their country, being either directly involved in decision making, or working closely with decision makers as advisors. Two parallel consultation methods were implemented; the first concerned semi-directive interviews carried out by members of the DaCoTA WP 1 partners with members of the Panel mainly from their own countries, and the second concerned a request for written contributions in case of language or time constraints. Particular emphasis was given to the open nature of the questions, both within the interviews and the written contributions, allowing the experts to describe their own experiences, views and messages and to put emphasis on the issues they consider themselves important, without being "directed" by a detailed questionnaire to specific judgments. The consultation provided a wealth of information on all aspects of road safety management in the European countries. A synthesis of the results of this open consultation was carried out by means of a predefined matrix. In this matrix, the basic road safety management tasks were decomposed into their particular components, and were then cross-tabulated with distinct categories of needs (knowledge needs, data needs, methodological needs, tools needs etc.), allowing the linking of specific aspects of road safety policy making to specific benefits from using the necessary knowledge, data, methods and tools. The matrix allowed for a classification of the opinions provided by the experts in the written contributions as well as in the interviews. Overall, the consultation of the Experts Panel provided valuable information about the current practices and future needs and priorities for evidence-based road safety management in Europe. It was stressed that only through the establishment of appropriate structures and procedures can evidence-based road safety management be achieved. Specific recommendations on such structures and procedures include the institutional arrangements for road safety management to be carried out centrally (at national level) by a single dedicated organization, the establishment of links and processes for smooth and efficient interaction between national and local road safety policies, and the introduction of compulsory consideration of scientific evidence for each road safety decision. Several useful remarks and recommendations on the various road safety management tasks, from fact-finding and assessment of problems to the development of road safety strategies and programmes, and from the planning and implementation of these programmes to the monitoring and evaluation of their effectiveness, were also derived from this preliminary consultation. First of all, the need for setting ambitious yet realistic targets for the improvement of road safety was confirmed. As regards the development of road safety programmes and the selection of measures, a need for methodological advances was identified, including the improvement of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses, so that they can serve both for setting priorities and for assessing the combined effects of road safety measures. Moreover, the creation of handbooks and databases with accumulated international experience on these questions was proposed, with emphasis on the country-specific conditions necessary to take into account in order to reach the maximum benefit of each measure. With respect to the planning and implementation of road safety programmes and measures, the need to gather and harmonise the available information from the international experience of measures implementation was frequently expressed. In particular, the information and data on the procedures, the conditions, the time frame and the costs for implementing the measures need to be made available at European level. Furthermore, the monitoring and evaluation task is considered to be most essential, not only for assessing the effectiveness of road safety measures, but also for identifying needs for further improvement. Several methodological needs were also mentioned, including the need for standardized assessment tools (statistical models, analysis techniques etc.), that will allow for the identification of the reasons and mechanisms leading to the observed safety effect of the measures. Finally, a number of issues concerning the availability and quality of data for knowledge-based road safety management were outlined. They include the need to address the injury under-reporting problem at European level, the need for improved methods for determining accident locations by means of GIS technologies and tools, the need for improved exposure data, for increasingly reliable behavioural data and the need to promote the collection and use of in-depth accident investigation data. The Experts also stressed the need for road safety databases of different types (accident data, health data, exposure data etc.) to be linked and to be made more accessible. The synthesis of the results of the consultation may serve as a first overview of experiences with road safety management in the European countries. Furthermore, it may serve as an outline of expert opinions on the needs and priorities for knowledge, data and tools to support road safety management, as well as on the related needs for better processes and structures, allowing the integration of knowledge and decision support tools into policy making. It is noted that such a consultation was launched for the first time at European level. The main directions and priorities identified for knowledge-based road safety management are presented in detail in the present report. These can be useful not only for the collection (WP 3) and analysis (WP 4) of data and information intended to support road safety decision making, but they can also be used as a broader guide towards the improvement of road safety management processes and practices both by individual countries and at European Union level (WP 1). Finally, the information gathered in this consultation is also relevant for further developments of the ERSO, given the many suggestions made concerning the type of information and tools that should be made available at a European level.; RAPPORT DE CONTRA...|$|E

En 2008, le programme national «Priorité aux malades chroniques !" mettait surtout l'accent sur linformation du patient et sur l'accessibilité des soins. Dans une seconde étape, la ministre de la Santé Publique a demandé au Centre fédéral dexpertise des soins de santé (KCE) de développer, en concertation avec ladministration de la Santé Publique et l'INAMI, une vision relative à lorganisation future des soins chroniques. Le KCE a analysé la littérature scientifique internationale et les initiatives actuellement en cours, en Belgique et à létranger, pour la prise {{en charge}} des maladies chroniques. Les experts du terrain et les décideurs ainsi que les représentants des organisations de patients ont également été impliqués dans cette étude.

40|$|VIII, 166 p. Ill. Meer dan een kwart van de Belgische bevolking zegt aan een chronische aandoening te lijden, en door de vergrijzing neemt dit aantal steeds toe. In 2008 werd het nationaal programma Prioriteit aan de chronisch zieken gelanceerd, dat sterk de nadruk legde op goede informatie en op de toegankelijkheid van de zorg. In een volgende stap vroeg de {{minister}} van Volksgezondheid het Federaal Kenniscentrum voor de Gezondheidszorg (KCE) om samen met de FOD Volksgezondheid en het RIZIV een toekomstvisie voor de chronische zorg te ontwikkelen. Het KCE bestudeerde de internationale, wetenschappelijke literatuur, en keek naar het werk dat in binnen-en buitenland reeds rond chronische zorg gebeurde. Het betrok ook uitgebreid de mensen van het terrein, het beleid en de koepels van patiëntenverenigingen bij het onderzoek. Het resultaat: een Position paper die meer dan 50 concrete acties voorstelt om de organisatie van de chronische zorg fundamenteel te hervormen. SCIENTIFIC REPORT 11 [...] 1.

40|$|England {{contains}} extensive {{areas of}} beautiful and wild natural landscapes {{of which the}} English public are justifiably proud. A highly controlled and scientific trial reintroduction of Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) (herein referred to as lynx) to a specifically selected wild area of England {{is the first step}} in a process that could see the lynx return to the nation after 1300 years of absence – a vital part of England's natural heritage. This document represents the first stage in the <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> the national <b>stakeholders</b> in a trial reintroduction of lynx to England (the "Project"). The Project will bring millions of pounds of economic benefits to the English economy, improve the health of natural environments in England and, above all else, will be a symbol for the pride that the English public have in their nation's wild places.

40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} work presents a conceptual modelling framework for integrated {{water resources management}} at {{the scale of the}} river basin, developed in the frame of the European project GOUVERNe. This paper presents an attempt to develop an integrated model of a watershed {{to be used as a}} tool to facilitate debates between stakeholders and thus to enhance the participatory process. From a modelling development viewpoint, the work aims at evaluating the potentialities and limitations of this kind of approach compared to more classical determinist and distributed hydrological models. Based on a comprehensive knowledge and expertise of geological, hydrogeological and hydrological features of the basin, as well as on extensive <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stakeholders</b> involved in the water resource management of the basin, a conceptual model of the sociohydrosystem of the Hérault floodplain (100 km) was proposed. A simulator was then developed using Matlab/Simulink © software to ensure the numerical translation of the conceptual model. This simulator is problem-solving oriented allowing to investigate the responses of the hydrosystem according to various scenarios defined by the <b>stakeholders</b> <b>of</b> the basin. It has been used to compute groundwater and river flows. Compared to observed data, the first numerical results are convincing regarding the simulated groundwater and river water levels. But the simulator also predicted unrealistic hydrological situation caused by mis-translation of the action rules attributed to certain stakeholders. In that sense, the simulator is seen as a powerful modelling concept to assess the correct understanding and mathematical coding of social or economic behaviour of actors...|$|R
40|$|Engaging {{communities}} in forest landscape restoration {{is indeed a}} great challenge. The forest landscape in Barangay Kawayanon has been a recipient of several reforestation programs in the early 1980 s, but illegal logging, fuelwood gathering, grazing, frequent forest fires and the lukewarm involvement of local people have kept the area as permanent grassland {{for more than three}} decades. Community people do not engage in forest restoration activities out of interest but rather due to the cash incentive they have from their involvement. After reforestation project implementation, their participation greatly declines. In support of the National Greening Program of the Philippine Government, a pilot reforestation project was implemented in May 2014 in Kawayanon by the ACIAR Watershed Rehabilitation Project Team. A series <b>of</b> meetings, <b>consultations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stakeholders,</b> community mapping and an information campaign were undertaken by the team prior to the implementation of the project. Consequently, community members have been actively engaged in this project. They planted and are maintaining nearly 20 ha of trees which are growing vigorously and have not been damaged by forest fires or grazing. This research has identified a number of keys to successful engagement of {{communities in}} forest landscape restoration. These include social preparation, deployment of community organizers, encouraging cooperation among stakeholders, an information and education campaign, and capacity building. Responsive leadership, weekly meetings with the community organizers and the people's organization, transparent financial accounting, and support for livelihoods (i. e. payments for seedling production, and plantation and agroforestry system establishment) likewise enhanced community engagement...|$|R
