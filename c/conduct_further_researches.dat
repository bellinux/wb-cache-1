40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the phenomenon of networked symbolic violence in the Chinese micro-blog sphere. The main research questions are: (1) what are the main features of networked symbolic violence on the Chinese micro-blog Weibo, and (2) what are the main aspects of networked symbolic violence? In this study, the theory of structural violence, symbolic violence and {{the law of the}} mental unity of crowds will be used as the theoretical framework. Through a literature review and two case studies using content analysis, {{the findings of this study}} reveal that networked symbolic violence has four different stages: the beginning phase, the rising phase, the explosive phase and the dying down phase. And there are four main types of networked symbolic violence on Chinese micro-blog, they are aggressive language, aggressive symbols which contain metaphorical expressions of insult to attack others online, malicious rumors, and revealing others’ privacy. Furthermore, the networked symbolic violence on micro-blogs has four phases: a beginning phase, a rising phase, an explosive phase, and a dying-down phase. In the discussion part, the phenomenon of the crowd in the micro-blog era is discussed. Some tentative measures are also provided to prevent and stop networked symbolic violence on Chinese micro-blogs. Finally, the author indicates that it is necessary to <b>conduct</b> <b>further</b> <b>researches</b> on the cause of networked symbolic violence in Chinese society...|$|E

40|$|The purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the work of}} passenger locomotive protective devices in the test scenarios of collisions adopted in the Russian requirements to the passive safety system. Methodology. Minimization {{of the effects of}} incident collisions is done by inclusion of the passive safety devices designed to absorb the kinetic energy of collision in the car bodies bearing constructions. To estimate the maximum accelerations of the train, as well as the compressing longitudinal forces arising in the intercar connection during collisions the discrete mass model of the train is used. Interaction of the train cars was simulated by introducing intercar connections. Findings. At collision of a locomotive at 20 km/h speed (both in separate and in standard train), which does not have a passive safety system, with a vehicle of 10 tones weight the plastic deformations in the locomotive structural elements are observed. At collision of a locomotive with a vehicle, which a mass is comparable to the mass of the loaded car, the plastic deformations in the locomotive structural elements occur at the 10 km/h speed of collision. Originality. It is shown that to decrease the maximum longitudinal force occurring between the locomotive and an obstacle like a freight car of 80 tons mass to the standard value it is necessary to equip the end parts of locomotive with safety devices, which deformation is about 1. 5 m. Practical value. To preserve the car structures integrity and passengers, staff and locomotive brigade safety at the incident collisions, a new generation passenger locomotives have to be equipped with the passive safety system devices. On this basis, it is necessary to <b>conduct</b> <b>further</b> <b>researches</b> in the field of passive safety systems for carriages...|$|E
40|$|Background: Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) is an {{acceptable}} treatment method in patients suffering from life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias. In spite of many advantages, ICD {{can lead to}} many challenges in living for these patients. Therefore, understanding these experiences can lead to improvement of holistic care and treatment of these patients. Objectives: This study aimed to identify and describe the patients’ experiences of living with ICD. Materials and Methods: This qualitative study was conducted using interpretative phenomenological approach. The participants who were selected through purposive sampling included 4 women and 6 men (mean age: 43. 1 ± 1. 6 years). The data were gathered through semi-structured interviews and field notes from November 2013 to December 2014. The data were also analyzed simultaneously using Van Manen’s proposed stages. Results: Analysis of the data resulted in emergence of 4 themes and 11 subthemes representing {{the dimensions of the}} patients’ lived experiences with ICD. These themes included “compromised self-identity”, “crossing the border of the unknown”, “fluctuation in the adjustment path”, and “surrounded by changes”. Compromised self-identity was manifested through “loss of prestige”, “changes in body image”, and “being hurt by the battery label”. “Unpredictable situation”, “rise and fall”, and “internal turmoil” were the main axes of crossing the border of the unknown. In addition, fluctuation in the adjustment path included “wandering to cope with ICD” and “institutionalization of ICD in life”. Considering the patients’ descriptions of surrounded by changes, “family changes”, “social role changes”, and “change in manifestation of routines” were of great importance. Conclusions: This study allowed in-depth identification of aspects of living with ICD. The results also promoted the ability of nurses to understand and interpret the views of patients about living with ICD. In this way, the quality of patient care becomes more favorable, resulting in improvement of the patients’ satisfaction. It can also provide a basis to <b>conduct</b> <b>further</b> <b>researches</b> on different aspects of prevention, care, treatment, and rehabilitation of these patients, leading to strengthening of the nursing research body...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The United Nations (UN) Property Management Unit (PMU) {{under the}} Logistics Support Division (LSD) of the Department of Field Support (DFS), in exercising {{effective}} stewardship over United Nations Owned Equipment (UNOE), sought {{to develop a}} Property Management Performance Management Framework. The present research was written to assess the current performance of the Property Management Performance Management Framework (PMPMF) and suggest further improvements. The scope of the PMPMF was also envisioned to be expanded to include other services with emphasis on the overall end to end processes of DFS/UN supply chain. Design/Methodology/Approach: Both qualitative and quantitative based approaches were adopted in this study. Several Academic literatures were reviewed to develop a robust performance management framework, TOTS Canvas. KPI categorization under the TOTS Canvas includes: Technological, Operational, Tactical and Strategic (TOTS). Findings: The research provides a novel framework for measuring the overall end to end processes within organizations with special emphasis on supply chain. The research results showed, that 91. 2 % of the users of the framework agree that the PMPMF has helped their missions to exercise good stewardship over UN assets. Consequently some benchmarking KPIs were identified and deemed as very significant to PMU/LSD/DFS/UNHQ end-to-end Supply Chain. These KPIs were categorized under eight sub-groupings. Other services under LSD were also identified {{to be included in}} the expansion of the current PMPMF. Research Limitations/Implications: Future studies can be conducted to validate the TOTS Canvas in different organizational settings. The envisioned end to end processes of the United Nations supply chain is still ongoing, certain Organizational principles might not be applicable in the near future so it will be vital to <b>conduct</b> <b>further</b> <b>researches</b> to validate the results and findings of this present research. Practical Implications: The thesis provides robust practical contribution applicable to mainstream supply chain performance management initiatives. This is achievable by applying the TOTS Canvas offered in this research. Practitioners and researchers who seek to identify an extensive end to end performance management involving several downstream and upstream processes can apply the TOTS Canvas Originality/Value: To the candid knowledge of the researcher, the categorizations of KPIs have not been done in a way reflecting the TOTS Canvas. It's tested with United Nations Supply Chain and proven relevant to PMU/LSD/DFS PMPMF...|$|E
30|$|Underground {{coal mining}} {{resulted}} in the overburden collapse and deformation, furthermore, caused the movement and deformation of the land surface (Gray 1990; Hu and Xiao 2013, 2014 a, b, c), which are the main forms of the mining impact to the eco-environment and is crucial for ecological restoration (Hu et al. 2014 a, b, c; Xiao et al. 2014 a, b). There are abundant coal resources in the windy and sandy region of northwestern China, and its occurrence characteristics, including shallow cover depth, thin bedrock, overlying hard strata, near-flat seam with thick sand on the surface, which are suitable for high-intensive coal mining characterized with large advancing speed, high recovery rate and big width/depth ratio, are significantly different from those in eastern China (Du 2010; Zhang et al. 2011; Liu 2014). The coal mines in the eastern China {{has long been the}} major mining areas (Xiao and Hu 2014), as China’s energy strategy moving westward, high-intensive coal mining is and will be in operation in the Shendong coalfield where the ecological environment is fragile, thus, the surface movement and deformation due to coal mining will be a prominent ecological problem, which poses a great threat to the ecological safety, however, few studies regarding the windy and sandy region can be referred (Wang et al. 2015). With the continually innovation of fully high-intensive mechanized technology, the high-intensive coal mining with super-large working (SLW) face has been widely applied in large coal bases due to its advantages as diverse as large panel dimensions, large advancing speed (10  m/d at least), high recovery rate, etc. (Wang 2014). Wu et al. (2010) considered that the large working face reduced the disturbance magnitude compared with the conventional working face in Yanzhou coalfield. Tan et al. (2008) had revealed the surface movement and deformation characteristics of a large working face in eastern China based on field measurements. The research of Teng and Liu (2002) in Wuyang coal mine with high-intensive mining shows similar results to Wu. Li (2010) applied the 3 D laser scanning technology in the research on the surface movement characteristics in Yanzhou coalfield, found the convergence of deformation values. Besides, the numerical simulation of mining subsidence cracks is also a research focus (Peng et al. 2009, 2010; Zhang et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2015). The methods of simulation and calculation have been recently applied in the research on overlying strata movement characteristics, ground pressure behavior, subsidence prediction associated with high-intensive mining in the windy and sandy region (Huang 2002; Wang et al. 2007; Xuan 2008; Fan et al. 2011; Ju et al. 2015). Sun (2008) compared the surface movement and deformation characteristics in the windy and sandy region with that in the loess area by using numerical simulation, Tang et al. (2007) proposed a subsidence prediction model and a parameter confirmation method in the windy and sandy region based on the stochastic medium theory. Gu et al. (2014) has obtained the surface movement and deformation characteristics under the condition of subcritical extraction in similar coal mines. The researches concerning the surface movement and deformation characteristics under the condition of high-intensive mining increase annually, however, there are still some unsatisfactory phenomena and need to <b>conduct</b> <b>further</b> <b>researches,</b> those are: (1) many achievements in the similar mining and geological conditions are mostly in the eastern China, theories and methods are more mature, and less researches concerned about the surface movement and deformation characteristics under the condition of critical extraction in the windy and sandy region; (2) most of the existing researches in the windy and sandy region are based on the numerical simulation and functional model, lacking comparison with measured data; (3) It is still unclear whether there is generality of surface movement and deformation characteristics under the condition of high-intensive mining, with certain mining and geological conditions in the windy and sandy region.|$|E
