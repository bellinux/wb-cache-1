40|$|Stereology is {{the science}} that uses {{geometric}} probability {{to extract the}} internal quantitative properties of a three dimensional object based on lower dimensional information. It is a valuable research tool in biological science and relies heavily on statistical principles. In this dissertation, we focus on studies that examine the number of neurons in a brain region of interest using stereological techniques in order to compare subjects in different diagnostic groups, e. g., subjects with schizophrenia and control subjects. A large number of <b>counting</b> <b>frames</b> are usually used to obtain a prespecified precision for an individual {{in these kinds of}} studies. Typically, researchers determine the number of <b>counting</b> <b>frames</b> for each individual by controlling the coefficient of error for the individual. However, the researchers from the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders (CCNMD) at University of Pittsburgh primarily focus on comparing biomarkers among different diagnosis groups rather than evaluating individuals. A design goal for such stereological studies is to keep study cost within budget and time constraints, while maintaining sufficient statistical power to address the research aims. Statistical power can be increased by either adding more subjects or more <b>counting</b> <b>frames.</b> And the cost of a study can be approximated by a linear combination of the number of subjects and number of <b>counting</b> <b>frames.</b> To address this need, we have developed new technologies that enable researchers to design a cost efficient study balancing the number of subjects with the number of <b>counting</b> <b>frames</b> for each subject. We also develop adaptive designs to conduct stereological studies. Adaptive designs allow the opportunity to look at the data at an interim stage, and to modify the design based on the information obtained from the first stage data. In our adaptive design, we estimate the stereological variance without breaking the blind of the Stage I data, and re-design the second stage based on the stereological variance estimator obtained from the first stage. Based on our procedure, we show researchers can cost-effectively modify the design while maintaining the desired study power...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of carrots for the German market comes mainly from domestic production. To ensure {{the efficiency of}} chemical weed control and to minimize the damage of the crop a splitting of the recommended dosage up to three times is often practiced. Because of large field areas of the carrot cropping and processing enterprises, the potential to save herbicides by practicing an herbicide application adapted to the weed occurrence is high. The efficiency of a site-specific herbicide splitting on the late weed occurrence {{as well as on}} yield parameters was tested in field strip trials. Weed species and abundance were determined manually by raster sampling using a <b>counting</b> <b>frame</b> in spring before spraying. Afterwards in the three leaf growth stages of the carrots the weed coverage level was detected online using a camera sensor developed by the Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering (ATB). Based on weed coverage level maps three application zones (200 L ha- 1, 300 L ha- 1, 400 L ha- 1) were defined. On both sides of the site specific splitting strip a uniform splitting strip (400 L ha- 1) was applied.

Sprague-Dawley rats aged 1 - 70 days were fixed by immersion or perfusion and embedded in Epon Araldite. Blocks of tissue were sectioned at 1. 5 pm and stained with toluidine blue dye. Sections were systematically scanned and the area! density of nuclear profiles counted using an unbiased <b>counting</b> <b>frame.</b> Numerical density and absolute number of germ cells in the processed block were then estimated. Corrections for processing shrinkage were determined by comparing the volume of processed and unprocessed samples.

All patientshad angiographically proven normal coronary arteries. Left bundle branch block was determined according to standart electrocardiographic criteria. The TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> was measured for each major coronary artery in each patient.

40|$|The disector is {{the only}} {{objective}} method for quantifying particles of variable size in a given volume. With this method, cell organelles are identified on adjacent sections, but only those present in one section are counted. When counting extremely rare structures in transmission electron microscope sections (physical disector), the usual procedure of counting on electron micrographs is limited for economic reasons (e. g. micrographs highly outnumbering the investigated structures). Hence, to apply this unbiased stereological method, a modification of the physical disector concerning 3 aspects has been developed. (1) The prerequisite of screening large corresponding tissue areas (here ∼ 65000 μm 2) was fulfilled by examining tissue areas {{along the edges of}} ultrathin sections. (2) The size of the <b>counting</b> <b>frame</b> was determined by measuring the lengths of the section margins (minus a guard area) by means of a Morphomat. This value was multiplied by the width of the investigated tissue zone, corresponding to the diameter of the electron microscope viewing screen. (3) Disector counting was carried out simultaneously on both sections (bidirectional disector) to improve efficiency. In the present study tiny synaptic bodies (SBs) were quantitated by disector in a rat pineal gland, yielding ∼ 30 SBs/ 1000 μm 3. By contrast, single section profile counts of SBs amounted to 90 SBs/ 20000 μm 2. Since the presently described adaptation of the disector is time-consuming, it is proposed to determine a proportion factor allowing to estimate number of structures per volume based on single section profile counts. This would decrease the evaluation time by more than 50 %...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Data on the {{distribution}} of primordial (single layer of squamous granulosa cells), early primary (some granulosa cells cuboidal) and primary (all granulosa cells cuboidal) follicles, grouped together as small follicles (SF) within the ovary of the elephant is lacking, yet such information is necessary to be able to estimate accurately the total numbers of small follicles in the ovaries of elephant throughout their lifespan. AIM: To determine if the density of SF differs between ovaries, between the surfaces of an ovary, or between the interpolar and intermarginal zones of an ovary. MATERIALS/METHODS: Stereological techniques were employed on 25 μm thick histological sections of the ovaries recovered from 12 prepubertal elephant calves aged 2 months to 4. 5 years. Cell densities were calculated using the optical brick method and Cavalieri's principle for volume calculation. RESULTS: The density of SF (numbers of SF per unbiased <b>counting</b> <b>frame</b> [UCF]) did not differ between the left (1. 11 ± 0. 39 (mean ± sd)) and right (1. 10 ± 0. 39) ovaries (P = 0. 82, n = 12), or between the lateral (median 1. 24; interquartile range 0. 85 – 1. 39) and medial (1. 03; 0. 76 – 1. 36) surfaces of the ovary (P = 0. 22, n = 24) or among the 5 segments of the ovary between the two poles (P = 0. 20, n = 24). The third of the cortex nearest to the mesovarial margin of the ovary had fewer small follicles per UCF (0. 85; 0. 51 – 1. 28) than the middle third (1. 01; 0. 78 – 1. 42; P = 0. 034), and the third adjacent to the free margin (1. 27; 0. 79 – 1. 51; P = 0. 0024), n = 24 per group. CONCLUSION: Providing a random sample is taken from the full interpolar and intermarginal dimensions of ovary of a non-pregnant elephant, the density of small follicles throughout the cortex may be accurately measured using stereological techniques applied to one of its surfaces.

40|$|The number zero {{represents}} an integer, {{that can be}} found between the number 1 and - 1 on the number line. The number zero separates natural numbers and divides them into positive and negative integers. The Babylonians were allegedly the first to use the number zero; as far back as 300 BC they added zero to the abacus, a simple <b>counting</b> <b>frame,</b> by marking empty space with two wires. In the 5 th Century, the mathematicians of India gave the number zero a numerical value and a regular fixed position on the number line. The number zero always played a special role in history, for it differs from any other number. Even today, it has a specific role - e. g. we always start counting with the number 1 and leave zero out. A similar example is the way we count time, as the calendar year zero was left out and we started with year 1. Because we were interested if the number of zero today is a student problem, we decided to examine this in the empirical part. In the practical part of this BA thesis we researched the role of the number zero in numerical operations as well as the comprehension of its positional value. The data was gathered via a written test taken by 10 randomly chosen pupils of the 5 th grade of the Primary School. It has been established that the most mistakes occur when dividing by zero and when dividing in cases, where the zero occurs in the process of computation. When estimating the comprehension of the positional value of the number zero, the most mistakes occurred when estimating the result, where zero in record define the size of number, less at written record of the positional value of the number, that the record contains the number zero. Arithmetic operations of addition, substraction and multiplication aren't causing problems to students and they were, on everage, very successful. ...|$|E

However, such data in syndrome X was lacking. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the prognostic value of the TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> in syndrome X patients, compared with the normal population. Methods: The TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> was measured in 2, 049 consecutive patients referred for coronary angiography from March 2003 to February 2005. Results: Among 308 patients with normal coronary angiograms, 44 undergoing the procedure for electrophysiologic studies or valvular heart disease surveys other than angina were designated normal controls. Another 155 patients with positive stress test results were diagnosed as syndrome X. Comparisons of the two groups showed that the syndrome X patients had higher <b>frame</b> <b>counts</b> in the left anterior descending artery (40. 9 ± 15. 7 vs. 47. 8 ± 25. 4; p < 0. 05) and left circumflex artery (35. 2 ± 11. 7 vs. 42. 0 ± 18. 7; p < 0. 05). A similar trend was found in the right coronary artery (29. 3 ± 13. 5 vs. 31. 9 ± 15. 9; p = 0. 2). The TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> in each artery of the syndrome X group was related to the patients' variables (sex, age, and body mass index), clinical variables (medication use, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and family history), and hemodynamic variables (aortic systolic blood pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure). By multivariate analysis, the TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>counts</b> in all arteries were significantly higher in women and lower with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use (both p < 0. 05). The <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> in the left anterior descending was associated with diuretics use (p < 0. 05).

30|$|Luci’s {{first moment}} of {{applying}} the symbolic activity of counting and creatively re-assigning meaning {{to a new}} material artefact, (the felt bead necklace), was received in amazement and surpise by her grandparents. Already the subject of deep interest, the fifty second video capture of Luci’s momentary interaction, opened up opportunities to share and celebrate Luci’s growing skills {{and understanding of the}} world around her. Moyles et al. (2002) for example, support the idea that “Play and playful forms of activity potentially lead towards increasingly mature forms of knowledge, skills and understanding (p. 21).” In the mobile phone video data there is evidence that Luci’s playful forms of activity with the felt bead necklace, led her towards imaginative expression of symbolic knowledge. It also showed her agentic imagination in the way her playful activity was unified and embodied in layered influences of emotion, cognition and the surrounding environment (Ridgway et al. 2016). The transcript reveals that a simple walk in the stroller with Luci became an impressionable and affective activity for all participants. Having grandparent’s supportive attention, provided Luci with established, familiar, responsive and reciprocal relations. Grandparents know and love Luci. They had thought that the qualities of granny’s necklace would be alive with imaginative and creative possibilities for Luci’s already established interest in combinations of colour and pattern. Luci’s attention to details of colour and pattern are continually educated at home in her mother’s art studio and embodied in Luci’s playful thoughts, actions and expressive, colourful creations. “A child’s play is not simply a reproduction of what he has experienced, but a creative re-working of the impressions he has acquired” (Vygotsky 2004, p. 5). The surprising creative re-working, occurs in Luci’s action of using the felt bead necklace like a <b>counting</b> <b>frame</b> or abacus. From Bruner (1973 p. 209) comes the idea that “an act that produces effective surprise – this I shall take as the hallmark of a creative enterprise.” Luci’s capacity to initiate counting in a one to one sequence surprised her grandparents, and could certainly be considered an act of creative enterprise.|$|E

In this prospective observational study, relationship between final TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>counts</b> of the culprit coronary artery and admission glucose values was investigated in patients who underwent successful primary PCI due to acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods: During a 6 - month period of time, 73 non-diabetic patients presented with acute STEMI who have undergone primary PCI with final TIMI 3 flow were consecutively included in the study. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to final TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>counts.</b> Group 1 (n= 53) consisted of patients with final TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>counts</b> of the culprit coronary artery within the two standard deviation of predefined values and Group 2 (n= 20) consisted of those with higher TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>counts.</b> Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U tests and multiple linear regression analysis. Results: Despite similar fasting glucose values, admission glucose levels were significantly higher in Group 2 as compared to Group 1 (138 [114 - 165] vs. 123 [97 - 143] mg/dl, p= 0. 03).

Conclusion: We have shown that patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and angiographically normal coronary arteries have higher TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>counts</b> for all three coronary vessels, indicating impaired coronary blood flow, compared to control subjects without dilated cardiomyopathy...|$|R
3000|$|... a {{shows the}} number of {{redundant}} frames accumulated in the network until the destination is reached when the network size is increased while keeping the average network density constant at 10. Accordingly, SNCF shows the highest <b>frame</b> <b>counts</b> and it grows faster than for CA protocol. For example, in a 50 -node network SNCF caused accumulation of around 250 frames while CA protocol resulted in a number {{less than half of}} that. Furthermore, <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> increases from around 75 to 250 by SNCF in static network when the network size increases from around 10 to 50 nodes. The growth of <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> is even steeper for SNCF when the nodes are mobile as it increases from about 75 to 400. In contrast CA protocol shows only an increase from about 20 to 150 when the network size increases from 10 to 50 nodes.|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to compare the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> (CTFC) with coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BackgroundThe relationship between CTFC and CFVR has not been adequately assessed in patients with coronary artery disease. MethodsWe studied 62 patients who underwent successful non-emergent PCI. All patients had Doppler evaluation of CFVR, CTFC, and quantitative coronary angiography. In an additional 17 patients, a <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> reserve was calculated as baseline CTFC/CTFC at peak hyperemia, induced by intracoronary adenosine after PCI. ResultsThe CTFC decreased from 27 ± 13 to 18 ± 8, and CFVR increased from 1. 5 ± 0. 4 to 2. 6 ± 0. 7 (both p < 0. 0001). The pre-PCI CTFC and the CFVR were closely related to minimal lumen diameter (p < 0. 0001). After PCI, there was no correlation between CFVR and CTFC. In addition, no relationship was observed between CFVR and the <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> reserve. ConclusionsThere was no significant correlation between CFVR and CTFC in patients undergoing coronary intervention. The relative utility of these measures in predicting outcomes in this setting requires further evaluation, but CTFC (or <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> reserve) {{does not appear to be}} an adequate surrogate measure of Doppler-derived CFVR...|$|R
