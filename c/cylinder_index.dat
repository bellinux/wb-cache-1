50|$|The <b>Cylinder</b> <b>Index</b> (or C.I.) was {{established}} {{on the basis}} of Soucheray's enthusiastic fascination with internal combustion engines. It is a measurement device in which the total number of internal combustion engine cylinders (working or non-working) owned by an individual (single-cylinder chainsaws, lawnmowers, 2-cycle, 4-cycle, multi-cylinder diesels, trucks and farm tractors) are tallied. The Garage Logician who attains a C.I. in excess of his age is revered.|$|E
40|$|A 32 -wk-gestation female {{with type}} II achondrogenesis-hypochondrogenesis has been studied. The {{clinical}} features were typical, and radiographs revealed short ribs, hypoplastic ilia, absence of ossification of sacrum, pubis, ischia, tali, calcanei, and many vertebral bodies; the long bones were short with mild metaphyseal flaring. The femoral <b>cylinder</b> <b>index</b> was 6. 3. Comparison with previous cases placed the patient toward the mild {{end of the}} achondrogenesis-hypochondrogenesis spectrum (Whitley-Gorlin prototype IV). Light microscopy revealed hypercellular cartilage with decreased matrix traversed by numerous fibrous vascular canals. The growth plate was markedly abnormal. Ultrastructural studies revealed prominently dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum containing a fine granular material with occasional fibrils in all chondrocytes. Immunohistologic studies indicated irregular large areas of cartilage matrix staining with monoclonal antibody to human type III collagen. The relative intensity of matrix staining for type II collagen appeared diminished. More striking, however, were intense focal accumulations of type II collagen within small rounded perinuclear structures of most chondrocytes but not other cell types. These results strongly suggest intracellular retention of type II collagen within vacuolar structures, probably within the dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum observed in all chondrocytes by electron microscopy (EM), and imply {{the presence of an}} abnormal, poorly secreted type II collagen molecule. Biochemical studies (see companion paper) suggest that this patient had a new dominant lethal disorder caused by a structural abnormality of type II collagen...|$|E

40|$|The Rotating Cylinder Valve (RCV) Engine {{is a novel}} 4 {{cycle engine}} that is a {{practical}} alternative to conventional 2 and 4 stroke designs, in particular for small capacity single cylinder applications. It is primarily intended to address applications where emissions legislation is forcing manufacturers to abandon the traditional carburetted 2 stroke. It has particular benefits for the moped/light motorcycle market. The engine operates on a simple principle. The cylinder liner is rotated around the piston at half engine speed via a pair of bevel gears. A port {{in the side of}} this <b>cylinder</b> <b>indexes</b> with inlet and exhaust ports in the surrounding casing. This rotary valve serves the cylinder as the engine cycles through the conventional 4 stroke cycle. The main technical issue that has been addressed is the design of a practical rotary valve seal. The RCV seal design provides a gas-tight compression seal, accommodates large thermal distortions, and takes up both production tolerance and longer term wear. The design is low cost, and simple to assemble and service. The rest of the components within the engine are conventional. The RCV engine offers all the normal emissions advantages that a 4 stroke has over a conventional 2 stroke. It also has many benefits compared to a conventional poppet valve 4 stroke, in particular a predicted production cost comparable to a conventional 2 stroke. The design has other significant technical benefits, including excellent thermal distribution, and good breathing characteristics. For moped applications the rear wheel power output of the engine will be competitive with current 2 stroke designs and exceeds the power output of typical small capacity poppet valve 4 stroke designs...|$|R

40|$|We propose for {{the first}} time a simple {{realization}} of a two-dimensional Parity-Time symmetric hexagonal shaped photonic structure composed of honeycomb lattice. The structure has a symmetric periodic modulation of the refractive index on the wavelength scale, which is combined with an anti-symmetric gain/loss distribution on the same scale. That leads to non-reciprocal light coupling at resonant frequencies. The design of the realistic structure is based on a simple physical concept: alternating low <b>index</b> <b>cylinders</b> with gain and loss in a honeycomb configuration, embedded in a higher index dielectric background.

40|$|The Rudin, NIBEM, lacing <b>index,</b> <b>cylinder</b> pour {{and shake}} foam quality tests were {{comprehensively}} compared {{to evaluate their}} utility and responsiveness to beer components that are regarded to influence foam quality. It was found {{that each of the}} tests responded differentially to beer characteristics that influence beer foam quality. The Rudin and shake tests were found to respond positively to the level and content of foam promoting proteins (i. e., protein Z 4) and also to the level of isomerised hop-a-acids in beer. However, the shake test did not differentiate between isomerised and hydrogenated hop-a-acids while the Rudin test did. Lacing index was found to respond positively to isomerised hop acids, hydrogenated in particular, but negatively to alcohol. Hydrogenation of hop acids and protein Z 4 increased foam stability as measured by the cylinder pour test while alcohol, higher pH and CO 2 level tended to reduce foam stability. A positive association was not observed with the level of isomerised hop acid, but further investigation is required to clarify this. Finally, the NIBEM test results were influenced positively by the level of isomerised hop acids and protein Z 4, while negatively correlated with viscosity and final gravity. Hop acid hydrogenation substantially improved NIBEM foam stability compared to isomerised hop acids. The NIBEM test was positively correlated with the Rudin, <b>cylinder</b> pour, lacing <b>index</b> and shake (foam quality generated) tests. These comparisons and observations suggest how these foam quality evaluation tests may be best used for quality control/assurance and beverage development...|$|R

40|$|We {{experimentally}} and numerically investigate femtosecond {{pulse propagation}} in a microstructured optical fiber {{consisting of a}} silica core surrounded by air holes which are filled with a high index fluid. Such fibers have discrete transmission bands which exhibit strong dispersion arising from the scattering resonances of the high <b>index</b> <b>cylinders.</b> We focus on nonlinear propagation near the zero dispersion point {{of one of these}} transmission bands. As expected from theory, we observe propagation of a red-shifted soliton which radiates dispersive waves.

40|$|Abstract—A {{simple and}} {{accurate}} model is presented for computation {{of the electromagnetic}} induction (EMI) resonant frequencies of canonical conducting and ferrous targets, in particular, finite-length cylinders and rings. The imaginary resonant frequencies correspond to the well known exponential decay constants of interest for time-domain EMI interaction with conducting and ferrous targets. The results of the simple model are compared to data computed numerically, via method-of-moments (MoM) and finiteelement models. Moreover, the simple model is used to fit measured wideband EMI data from ferrous cylindrical targets (in terms of {{a small number of}} parameters). It is also demonstrated that the general model for the magnetic-dipole magnetization, in terms of a frequency-dependent diagonal dyadic, is applicable to general rotationally symmetric targets (not just <b>cylinders</b> and rings). <b>Index</b> Terms—Induction, magnetization, resonance, sensing.

50|$|Here, nondegeneracy {{means that}} 1 {{is not an}} {{eigenvalue}} of the derivative of the symplectomorphism at any of its fixed points. This condition implies that the fixed points are isolated. SFH is the homology of the chain complex generated by the fixed points of such a symplectomorphism, where the differential counts certain pseudoholomorphic curves in {{the product of the}} real line and the mapping torus of the symplectomorphism. This itself is a symplectic manifold of dimension two greater than the original manifold. For an appropriate choice of almost complex structure, punctured holomorphic curves (of finite energy) in it have cylindrical ends asymptotic to the loops in the mapping torus corresponding to fixed points of the symplectomorphism. A relative index may be defined between pairs of fixed points, and the differential counts the number of holomorphic <b>cylinders</b> with relative <b>index</b> 1.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} what today is called a revolver were made in Germany in the late 16th century. These weapons featured a single barrel with a revolving cylinder holding the powder and ball. They would soon be made by many European gun-makers, in numerous designs and configurations. However, these weapons were difficult to use, complicated and prohibitively expensive to make, and as such they were not widely distributed.

40|$|In 1979 ECMA {{published}} {{its first}} Standard ECMA- 58 for file structure and labelling of 200 mm flexible disk cartridges. Further work {{led to the}} development and publication in 1984 of Standard ECMA- 91 which is applicable to all flexible disk cartridges, in particular to those with FM recording on the <b>Index</b> <b>Cylinder.</b> For many purposes this Standard ECMA- 91 provides a satisfactory data interchange pathway between different types of information-processing systems. However, it imposes some restrictions on the operation of a system as follows: a) Each individual file must be recorded on the disk in a sequential, “batch-processing ” mode. After a set of files has been recorded on the disk, a file cannot be extended beyond its pre-determined length. It is common practice in small systems for the user to inter-act continuously with the system to update files. Files having a suitable structure for this purpose are not within the provisions of ECMA- 91. It is necessary for the interchange cartridge to be created by an “export ” copy process from the application’s files, after the application has terminated. A similar “import ” process is required in the receiving system. b) Limitations on the number of file labels permitted on an inter-change FDC prevents the full use of the disk space if the average size of files is significantly less than, say 20 Kbytes. For conventional data processing purposes this is mostly satisfactory. However, the file size typically encountered in text processing and small single-user systems are very much smaller and would lead to very inefficient use of the disk space...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} experimental {{measurements of}} the absorption and scattering cross sections and the spectral complex index of refraction of filamentous cyanobacteria. Filamentous heterocystous cyanobacterium Anabaena cylindrica was chosen as a model organism. Its filaments consisted of long chains of polydisperse cells. Their average mass scattering and absorption cross sections were measured from 400 to 750 nm at four different times during their batch growth in medium BG- 11 (-N) under 3000 lux of white fluorescent light. The effective real (or refraction index) and imaginary (or absorption index) parts of the complex index of refraction were retrieved using an inverse method based on a genetic algorithm. The microorganisms were modeled as infinitely long and ran-domly oriented volume-equivalent <b>cylinders.</b> The absorption <b>index</b> featured peaks corresponding to chlorophyll a (Chl a) at 436 and 676 nm and phycocyanin (PCCN) at 630 nm and a shoulder around 480 nm, corresponding to photoprotective carotenoids. The absorption peaks of Chl a and PCCN concentrations increased and the shoulder due to carotenoids decreased in response to photolimitation caused by biomass growth. Subsequent nitrogen limi-tation caused the PCCN absorption peak to decrease significantly due to degradation of PCCN as an endogenous source of nitrogen for nitrogenase maintenance and synthesis, as confirmed by increasing heterocyst differentia-tion.
