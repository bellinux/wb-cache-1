5|$|Rebeccah Cradock, Matthew's second wife, {{remarried}} to Benjamin Whichcote, another senior {{figure of}} the Cambridge Platonists, Provost of King's College, Cambridge, a close <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Ralph Cudworth's. Both were closely associated with Mathew Cradock's nephew, Samuel Cradock (a pupil of Whichcote's), whose brother Zachary was Provost of Eton College. Cudworth, Whichcote and Samuel Cradock had all been students at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|Ancient authors {{agreed that}} the worship of Terminus was of Sabine origin, ascribing its {{introduction}} to Rome either to Titus Tatius, the Sabine <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Rome's founding king Romulus (traditional reign 753717 BC), or to Romulus' successor Numa Pompilius (717673 BC). Those authors who gave the credit to Numa explained his motivation as the prevention of violent disputes over property. Plutarch further states that, in keeping with Terminus's character as a guarantor of peace, his earliest worship did not involve blood sacrifices.|$|E
5|$|Before {{creating}} Shaman King, Takei, {{an assistant}} of Nobuhiro Watsuki's Rurouni Kenshin, exchanged {{ideas about the}} series with the other assistants. As a <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Watsuki, he worked primarily as a manga assistant, only focusing on his own projects during his days off. He was influenced by street art from hip-hop and rap culture, which is apparent in his manga artwork. For drawing, he used calligraphy inks and pen nibs. When illustrating, he used Copic brand color markers.|$|E

5|$|Detectives also {{investigated}} {{the death of}} a woman who had been a <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Smith at the Rainbow. Patricia Lynott, a divorced mother of two from Ireland who had moved to Birmingham, had been found dead in her flat in October 2000. Police had not treated the death as suspicious, but after they discovered her connection to Smith, her body was exhumed for a second post mortem. This proved to be inconclusive, and in January 2003 a coroner's jury in Birmingham recorded an open verdict after hearing that the cause of her death could not be determined.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 Reich {{began an}} affair with a female patient, an actress who had been married to a <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> his. According to Sigurd Hoel, the {{analysis}} would stop because of the relationship, then the relationship would end and the analysis would start up again. The patient eventually threatened to go to the press, but was persuaded that it would harm her as much as it would Reich. Around the same time, Reich also had {{an affair with}} Gerd Bergersen, a 25-year-old Norwegian textile designer.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Court {{upheld a}} federal statute banning partial-birth {{abortion}} in Gonzales v. Carhart. University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey R. Stone, a former <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Scalia's, criticized Gonzales, stating that religion had influenced the outcome because all five justices {{in the majority}} were Catholic, whereas the dissenters were Protestant or Jewish. This angered Scalia {{to such an extent}} that he stated he would not speak at the University of Chicago as long as Stone was there.|$|E

5|$|James Frain plays Kieran Ashton, {{a former}} <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Karl, who faked his suicide {{and became the}} Truth Terrorist, serving as the primary antagonist. The {{character}} is motivated {{by the loss of}} his identity and family, as well as betrayal from Karl by his affair with Kieran's wife before her death. Frain believed that Kieran is the most disturbing character he has played. Portraying the character, the actor wanted to make his actions understandable, though not justifiable.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{supporting}} {{characters were}} given expansive and recurring {{appearances in the}} progressive storyline, including Samaire Armstrong as Anna Stern, Alan Dale as wealthy businessman and father of Kirstin, Caleb Nichol. Taylor Handley played Oliver Trask, a psychotic character who viewers loved to hate. Amanda Righetti starred as Kirstin's younger sister Hailey Nichol. Navi Rawat played Theresa Diaz, childhood sweetheart of Ryan. Bonnie Somerville acted as Rachel Hoffman, a former <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Sandy, and Ashley Hartman portrayed Holly Fischer a friend of Marissa and Summer.|$|E
5|$|Poliphilus {{is named}} after the book Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, one of Manutius's most famous books in the Latin alphabet, which was printed with the same roman as De Aetna but recut capitals; it was made for the Medici Society, who planned to create an English translation. Blado {{is named after}} the printer Antonio Blado, a <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Arrighi. Morison {{preferred}} Bembo's roman and was somewhat dismissive of Poliphilus. Unlike Bembo, both in metal featured a Greek-influenced Y with a curving head, as in the original.|$|E

5|$|Scalia {{enjoyed a}} warm {{relationship}} with fellow Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, considered {{a member of}} the court's liberal wing, with the two attending the opera together and even appearing together onstage as supernumeraries in Washington National Opera's 1994 production of Ariadne auf Naxos. Ginsburg was a <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Scalia's on the D.C. Circuit, and the Scalias and the Ginsburgs had dinner together every New Year's Eve.|$|E
5|$|The {{connection}} between M and {{the inspiration for}} his character, Rear Admiral John Godfrey, was made apparent with Bond visiting Quarterdeck, M's home. He rings the ship's-bell for HMS Repulse, M's last command: it was Godfrey's ship too. Godfrey was Fleming's superior officer in Naval Intelligence Division {{during the war and}} was known for his bellicose and irascible temperament. During their Christmas lunch, M tells Bond of an old naval acquaintance, a Chief Gunnery Officer named McLachlan. This was actually an old <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> both Godfrey and Fleming's in the NID, Donald McLachlan.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. When Mulder and Scully aid a former <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Mulder's in an {{investigation}} {{into a series of}} robberies, it becomes apparent that the culprit is an old nemesis of Mulder's—who had seemingly died in prison several years previously.|$|E

5|$|There {{were several}} {{bystanders}} {{who witnessed the}} murder and managed to see {{the faces of the}} assassins, including Juan Manuel Bautista, a <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Buendía; Rogelio Barrera Galindo, a man who had parked his vehicle close to the journalist's; and Felipe Flores Fernández, a bus driver. Among the first to arrive at the murder scene was José Antonio Zorrilla Pérez, then-head of the Federal Security Directorate (DFS), Mexico's equivalent of the FBI, and one of Buendía's main sources for his political publications. Photos of Buendía's corpse circulated across Mexico {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|After Trestman's hiring, {{he hired}} New Orleans Saints' {{offensive}} line coach Aaron Kromer as offensive coordinator, and the Dallas Cowboys later reported that Joe DeCamillis, who had been among the Bears' 13 head coaching candidates, would join the Bears as the team's assistant head coach/special teams coordinator. Trestman also hired Andy Bischoff and Michael Sinclair as tight ends and defensive line coaches, respectively; both coaches had worked with Trestman in Montreal. Alouettes offensive coordinator Pat Meyer also joined the Bears as {{offensive line coach}}, along with Purdue defensive coordinator and <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Trestman, Tim Tibesar, as linebackers coach. Former Alouettes coaches Brendan Nugent and Carson Walch were hired as offensive quality control assistants.|$|E
5|$|After a rough {{position}} of the burst had been determined, Enrico Costa of the BeppoSAX team contacted astronomer Dale Frail at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array. Frail began making observations at a wavelength of 20centimeters at 01:30UTC, less than four hours after the discovery. While preparing for his observations Frail contacted astronomer Stanislav Djorgovski, who was working with the Hale telescope. Djorgovski immediately compared his images of the region with older images from the Digitized Sky Survey, but he found no new sources of light within the error box. Mark Metzger, a <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Djorgovski at the Caltech observatory, conducted a more extensive analysis of the data, but was also unable to identify any new light sources.|$|E
