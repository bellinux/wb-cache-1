It {{is assumed that}} there can be positional restriction on the installation of <b>optical</b> <b>mice</b> {{at the bottom of a}} mobile robot. First, the velocity kinematics of a mobile robot with an array of <b>optical</b> <b>mice</b> is obtained and the resulting Jacobian matrix is analysed symbolically. Second, the isotropic, anisotropic and singular <b>optical</b> <b>mouse</b> placements are identified, along with the corresponding characteristic lengths.

Finally, simulation results for several different placements of three <b>optical</b> <b>mice</b> are given...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{in order}} to develop an {{accurate}} localization for mobile robots, we propose a dead-reckoning system based on increments of the robot movements read directly from the floor using <b>optical</b> <b>mouse</b> sensors. The movements of two axes are measurable with an <b>optical</b> <b>mouse</b> sensor. Therefore, {{in order to}} calculate a robot’s deviation of position and orientation, it is necessary to attach two <b>optical</b> <b>mouse</b> sensors in the robot. However, it is also assumed that a sensor cannot read the movements correctly due to the condition of the floor, the shaking of the robot, etc. To solve this problem, we arrange multiple <b>optical</b> <b>mouse</b> sensors around the robot and compare sensor values. By selecting reliable sensor values, accurate dead-reckoning is realized. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of this algorithm through several experiments with an actual robot. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The 1980 Xerox <b>optical</b> <b>mouse</b> invention, and {{subsequent}} product, {{was a successful}} deployment of embedded vision, {{as well as of}} the Mead–Conway VLSI design methodology that we developed at Xerox PARC in the late 1970 s. The de-sign incorporated an interpretation of visual lateral inhibition, essentially mimicking biology to achieve a wide dynamic range, or light-level-independent operation. Con-ceived in the context of a research group developing VLSI design methodologies, the <b>optical</b> <b>mouse</b> chip represented an approach to self-timed semi-digital design, with the analog image-sensing nodes connecting directly to otherwise digital logic using a switch-network methodology. Using only a few hundred gates and pass tran-sistors in 5 -micron nMOS technology, the <b>optical</b> <b>mouse</b> chip tracked the motion of light dots in its field of view, and reported motion with a pair of 2 -bit Gray codes for x and y relative position—just like the mechanical mice of the time. Besides the chip, the only other electronic components in the mouse were the LED illuminators.

The path following performance of the robot was tested in both open-loop and closed-loop modes and the <b>optical</b> <b>mice</b> were found to be a promising but inexpensive sensor to the dead-reckoning for robot motion control [...] Keywords: Mecanum wheel, <b>optical</b> <b>mouse,</b> motion control, mobile robot...|$|R
