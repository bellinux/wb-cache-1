40|$|In {{a simple}} model of {{segmented}} markets and exogenous liquidity shock, the closed-end <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> premium is negatively {{affected by the}} illiquidity in the host market where shares of the <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> are traded, and positively affected by the illiquidity in the home market where the underlying assets are traded. To the extent that expected and unexpected liquidity affects asset prices and returns, the closed-end <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> premium should reflect {{the difference between the}} illiquidity of the fund shares and its underlying assets. Using the Amihud (2002) measure of illiquidity, we examine this hypothesis for U.

Moreover, this relation is much stronger for funds investing in emerging markets where market segmentation {{is more likely to be}} binding.

Moreover, an index of <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> premiums differentiates size-ranked U. S. portfolio returns and forecasts <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> stock returns.

40|$|Using data on country funds, {{the authors}} study how {{differential}} {{access to information}} affects international investment.

The price (NAV) adjustment coefficients are low and negatively correlated with the local (foreign) market variability [...] {{but not with the}} fund price (NAV) variability. NAVs seem to be closer to local information. They are the asset prices that react first to local news. Later the <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> holders receive the information and those prices react after NAVs have reacted. The 1995 Mexican crisis and the 1997 Asian crisis are two examples of this type of behavior. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of asymmetric information, according to which the holders of the underlying assets have more information about local assets than the <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> holders do. The authors empirically test the asymmetric information hypothesis against the noise traders hypothesis. A theoretical model is presented in the appendix.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the behavior of}} closed-end <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> discounts, including evidence from the Mexican and East Asian crises. It finds that the ratio of fund prices to their fundamental value increases dramatically during a crisis, an anomaly that we denote the "closed-end <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> puzzle. " Our {{results show that the}} puzzle relates directly to the fact that international investors are less (more) sensitive to changes in local (global) market conditions than domestic investors. This asymmetry implies that foreign participation in local markets can help dampen the effect of a crisis in asset prices in the originating country, at the cost of amplifying contagion to noncrisis countries.

40|$|In a {{segmented}} {{international capital}} market, the illiquidity of a <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> {{in the market}} in which its shares are traded affects only the share price of the fund (S), while the illiquidity of its underlying assets in the market in which these are traded affects only the fund net asset value (NAV). In an integrated market, illiquidity in one market can easily spill over to another and affect both the fund share price and its underlying asset value. It follows that the closed-end <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> premium, P[reverse not equivalent]ln(S) -ln(NAV), is negatively (positively) affected by the fund (underlying asset) illiquidity in segmented capital markets, but has only an ambiguous association with either fund or underlying asset illiquidity in an integrated market. Empirical evidence for the 8 / 1987 to 12 / 2001 period from U. S. -traded single-country closed-end funds shows that the fund premium has a negative (positive) association with the fund (underlying asset) illiquidity, and the relation is much stronger for funds investing in segmented markets.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Mexican investors were the "front-runners" in the peso crisis of December 1994, turning pessimistic before international investors. Different expectations about their own economy, perhaps due to asymmetric information, prompted Mexican investors to be the first ones to leave the country. This paper investigates whether data from three Mexican country funds provide evidence that supports the "divergent expectations" hypothesis. We find that, right before the devaluation, Mexican <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> Net Asset Values (driven mainly by Mexican investors) dropped faster than their prices (driven mainly by foreign investors). Moreover, we find that Mexican NAVs tend to Granger-cause the <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> prices.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of the {{dissertation}} describes the two competing explanations that have been offered attempting to explain the puzzle. The proponents of the Efficient Market Hypothesis, argue that such apparent mispricing results from rational pricing in an efficient market where some frictions may be present, while critics of this hypothesis argue that such phenomenon {{is the result of}} noise traders in the market for CEF shares and rational traders in the market for the underlying stocks that comprise the Net Asset Value of the CEF (the Investor Sentiment Hypothesis). The second chapter examines the behavior of closed-end country funds and investment trusts discount/premiums following the Asian financial crisis of 1997 ‚Äì 98. More specifically, we document and analyze the puzzling large premiums developed by country funds dedicated to Asian and other emerging stock markets after the crises erupted. We also determine that none of the existing hypothesis that attempt to explain the closed-end fund discount puzzle can account for the emergence and time-series behavior of such large premiums, and propose a new explanation which assumes that money and capital markets are partially segmented. We perform a number of time series techniques such as cointegration tests and error correction models to test our hypothesis. The third chapter studies whether increases in implied volatilities on national stock indices, a proxy for increases in risk premia, affect the prices, net asset values (NAVs), and premiums of closed-end country Rinds (CEFs) and investment trusts (ITs). We conclude that changes in implied volatilities on the S 2 ÃÜ 6 P 500 (FTSE- 100) are generally not significant explaining either <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> (investment trust) prices or <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> (investment trust) NAVs, whereas changes in domestic implied volatilities affect a large number of <b>country</b> <b>fund</b> prices and NAVs, but are generally not significant in the case of investment trusts. ...|$|E
