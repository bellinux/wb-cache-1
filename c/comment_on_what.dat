5|$|Nixon {{instructed}} Agnew {{to avoid}} personal {{attacks on the}} press and the Democratic presidential nominee, South Dakota Senator George McGovern, to stress the positives of the Nixon administration, and not to <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> might happen in 1976. At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates who saw him as the party's future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration's accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting busing, and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew's exclusion from Nixon's inner circle worked in his favor, as he knew nothing of the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from Jeb Magruder that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern's initial running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past mental health treatment, the president renewed those instructions for the new candidate, Sargent Shriver.|$|E

25|$|Most of what {{is known}} about the actual {{proceedings}} of the meetings comes from notes kept by Durant which were later submitted as a memo to the NSC and commonly referred to as the Durant Report. In addition, various participants would later <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> transpired from their perspective. Captain (later Major) Edward Ruppelt, then head of Project Blue Book, first revealed the existence of the secret panel in his 1956 book, but without revealing names of panel members.|$|E
25|$|The show {{also has}} a number of less {{frequently}} appearing characters. Damian's bodyguard, Fyb3roptik, had an interesting habit of shooting at Damian every time he appeared. This running gag is a fan favorite, hence its continued appearances, but has not happened recently as of Episode 5. Also included is Gunnery Sergeant Spillane, voiced by John Keith, who also writes the show. He has only appeared once, to run the bodyguard competition. Peaches and Sherry, the camera operators, occasionally <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> is going on, but otherwise have a small role in the show. Clarence, Damian's Guardian Arbiter, appeared in Episode 4, but it was later seen that he was killed by a plasma grenade.|$|E

25|$|In drawing {{attention}} {{to a number of}} preliminary studies, the so-called primary project, that show an atelier installation incorporating the central triangular shape which reappears in the final version of Guernica, Becht-Jördens and Wehmeier interpret the painting as a self-referential composition in the tradition of atelier paintings such as Las Meninas by Diego Velázquez. In his chef d'oeuvre, Picasso seems to be trying to define his role and his power as an artist in the face of political power and violence. But far from being a mere political painting, Guernica should be seen as Picasso’s <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> art can actually contribute towards the self-assertion that liberates every human being and protects the individual against overwhelming forces such as political crime, war, and death.|$|E
25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E
500|$|On 27 April 2007, a new search {{involving}} {{some twenty}} investigators was launched at Van der Sloot's parents' home on Aruba. Dutch authorities searched {{the yard and}} surrounding area, using shovels and thin metal rods to penetrate the dirt. A spokesman for the prosecutor's office, Vivian van der Biezen, stated [...] "The investigation has never stopped and the Dutch authorities are completely reviewing the case for new indications". A statement released directly from the prosecutor's office stated: [...] "The team has indications that justify a more thorough search."

I think we're lucky because the guests we have on the show often <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> a good atmosphere Holby has. [...] Paul Bradley who plays Elliot is one of the funniest people to work with - when the cameras aren't rolling he's very good at turning difficult moments into humour when everyone's feeling the strain to finish the day." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening {{segment of}} the episode, which was leaked onto the {{internet}} weeks before the episode aired, features Homer voting for Barack Obama. Rather than taking sides in the election, executive producer Al Jean says it is [...] "mostly a <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> many people to {{believe to be the}} irregularities in our voting system." [...] "Untitled Robot Parody" [...] is modeled on the live action Transformers film, rather than the cartoon. Al Jean said it was [...] "just really fun to do transformations [...] you can see why they enjoyed doing that film." [...] "How to Get Ahead in Dead-Vertising" [...] featured a parody of the title sequence of Mad Men. Jean was a fan of the series and pitched the scene.|$|E
500|$|On April 27, 2007, a new search {{involving}} approximately 20 investigators {{was launched}} at the Van der Sloot family residence in Aruba.

According to Paulus van der Sloot, [...] "nothing suspicious" [...] was found, and all that was seized were diary entries of him and his wife, and his personal computer—which was subsequently returned. According to Jossy Mansur, managing editor of Aruba's Diario newspaper, investigators were following up on statements made during early suspect interrogations regarding communications between the Kalpoe brothers and Van der Sloot. He also said investigators could be seen examining a laptop at the house.|$|E

500|$|... ere we have John Wayne, {{who was a}} major {{artistic and}} {{psychological}} figure on the American scene, ... who at one point used to make movies of soldiers who had a certain validity, ... {{a certain sense of}} honor [...] what the soldier was doing.... Even if it was a cavalry movie doing a historically dishonorable thing to the Indians, even as there was a feeling of {{what it meant to be}} a man, what it meant to have some sense of duty.... Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because that would make a very striking <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> has happened to America in general.|$|E
500|$|Although gruesome for {{the most}} part, some segments, such as [...] "Citizen Kang" [...] in [...] "Treehouse of Horror VII", satirize {{political}} issues. The opening segment of [...] "Treehouse of Horror XIX" [...] featured Homer attempting to vote for Barack Obama but a rigged electronic voting machine instead registers a vote for John McCain. Rather than taking sides in the election, Al Jean says it is [...] "mostly a <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> many people to {{believe to be the}} irregularities in our voting system." [...] In [...] "Treehouse of Horror XVII", a segment called [...] "The Day the Earth Looked Stupid" [...] ends with Kang and Kodos taking over Springfield as part of a mission called [...] "Operation: Enduring occupation". The script originally called for Kodos and Kang to look over the smoking ruins of Springfield and say [...] "This sure is a lot like Iraq will be." [...] The Fox network did not have any objection to the line, but it was rejected by some of the writers as too obvious and was cut from broadcast. While cut from the aired version, the line does appear in the [...] "review" [...] version sent to newspapers and magazines.|$|E
500|$|Tesla {{had been}} working at the Machine Works {{for a total of}} six months when he quit. What event precipitated him leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for {{redesigning}} generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved. Tesla had previous run-ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned. In his own biography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design [...] "twenty-four different types of standard machines" [...] "but {{it turned out to be}} a practical joke". Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal quipping [...] "Tesla, you don't understand our American humor." [...] The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay and the company did not have that sort of cash (equivalent to $12 million today) on hand. Tesla's diary contains just one <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering December 7, 1884 to January 4, 1885 saying [...] "Good by to the Edison Machine Works".|$|E

2500|$|Pop, {{speaking}} of Bowie, described the Krautrock-influenced [...] "Nightclubbing" [...] as [...] "my <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> {{it was like}} hanging out with him every night". The track was recorded one night after the other musicians had left, Bowie playing the melody on piano with an old rhythm machine for backing. When Pop pronounced himself happy with the result, Bowie protested that they needed real drums to finish it off. Pop insisted on keeping the rhythm machine, saying [...] "it kicks ass, it's better than a drummer". Pop largely wrote the lyrics on the spot [...] "in ten minutes", Bowie suggesting that he write about [...] "walking through the night like ghosts".

2500|$|These accounts, written {{long after}} the Persian conquest, {{contradict}} {{many aspects of the}} contemporary cuneiform evidence, which does not mention any sieges, engineering works or battles near Babylon. The cuneiform descriptions of a peaceful surrender of Babylon are corroborated by archaeological evidence from the city, as no evidence of conflagrations or destruction have been found in the layers corresponding to the fall of the city to the Persians. Scholars are in general agreement that Herodotus's account is an invention, while Kuhrt comments that Xenophon's account in his Cyropedia is [...] "virtually impossible to use ... as a strictly historical source" [...] due to its literary form, as a moral treatise on Cyrus {{in the form of an}} historical novella. Paul-Alain Beaulieu suggests that the Greek accounts may constitute an aggregate of various folk tales and legends which came to be associated with the fall of Babylon."

2500|$|Politician and {{minister}} Jesse Jackson, {{a friend}} of Michael Jackson's family, said that the family was concerned about Murray's role. [...] "They {{have good reason to}} be [...] he left the scene." [...] Over the next few weeks, law enforcement grew increasingly concerned about the doctor, and on July 22 detectives searched Murray's medical office and storage unit in Houston, removing items such as a computer and two hard drives, contact lists and a hospital suspension notice. On the 27th, an anonymous source reported that Murray had administered propofol within 24 hours of Jackson's death. Murray's lawyers refused to <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> they called [...] "rumors, innuendo or unnamed sources." [...] The following day it was reported that investigators had searched Murray's home and office in Las Vegas, and that Murray had become the primary focus of the investigation. On August 11, a Las Vegas pharmacy was searched by investigators looking for evidence regarding Murray, according to an anonymous police source. Murray's lawyer advised patience until the toxicology results arrived, noting that [...] "things tend to shake out when all the facts are made known". [...] On February 8, 2010, Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter by prosecutors in Los Angeles. Murray pleaded not guilty and was released after posting $75,000 (USD) bail. Shortly after, the California Medical Board issued an order preventing Murray from administering heavy sedatives.|$|E
