5000|$|The {{first product}} {{released}} by the new subsidiary was MG1212, a 12 channel, 12 track recorder in 1984. This innovative device used a special VHS-like cartridge (a MK-20), and was good for 10 minutes of continuous 12 track recording (19 cm per second) or 20 minutes at half speed (9.5 cm per second). One track (14) was permanently dedicated to recording absolute time, and another one for synchronization such as SMPTE or MTC. Each channel strip included dbx type-1 noise reduction and semi-parametric equalizers (with fixed bandwidths). The unit also had innovations like an electronic 2 bus system, a 12 stereo <b>channel</b> <b>patch</b> bay and auto punch in and out, among others. The unique transport design and noise reduction gave these units a recording quality rivaling that of more expensive 16 track machines using 1" [...] tape. The MG-1212 was later replaced by the MG-1214, which improved the transport mechanism and overall performance.|$|E

It is unknown whether a ‘pure' anti-oestrogen such as ICI 182, 780 (Faslodex™), that has no known oestrogenic properties, would have any effect on BKCa channels. Using single <b>channel</b> <b>patch</b> clamp techniques on canine colonic myocytes, the hypothesis that ICI 182, 780 would activate BKCa channels was tested. ICI 182, 780 increased the open probability of BKCa channels in inside-out patches with an EC 50 of 1 μM. These data suggest that molecules with the ability to bind nuclear oestrogen receptors, regardless of oestrogenic or anti-oestrogenic nature, activate BKCa channels through this nongenomic, membrane-delimited mechanism.

This study has defined more clearly the basolateral K+ conductive properties of human colonic crypts using patch clamp recording techniques. High conductance (138 pS) K+ channels were seen in 25 % of patches (one or two <b>channels</b> per <b>patch),</b> and significantly inhibited by the addition of 5 mM Ba 2 +, 1 mM quinidine or 20 mM tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) to the cytosolic side of excised inside-out patches, whereas 1 mM diphenylamine- 2 -carboxylic acid (DPC) had no effect.

Channel conductance was 242 ± 33 pS (n= 67) in symmetrical KCl (140 mM). The channel was activated by membrane depolarization and increased cytosolic Ca 2 +. High selectivity was observed for K+ over Rb+(0. 49) >Cs+(0. 14) >Na+(0. 09). Open probability was significantly decreased by Ba 2 + (5 mM) and quinidine (5 mM) to either surface, but TEA (5 mM) was only effective when added to the external surface. All effects were reversible. Increasing cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration from 10 − 7 to 10 − 6 M caused an increase in open probability from near zero to fully activated. ATP decreased open probability at ∼ 2 mM, but the effect was variable. The channel was almost always observed together with a smaller conductance channel, although they could both be seen individually.

Ang II-induced hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes is mediated by nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a Ca 2 +-responsive transcriptional factor. It is believed that phospholipase C (PLC) -mediated production of inositol- 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) is responsible for Ca 2 + increase that is necessary for NFAT activation. However, we demonstrate that PLC-mediated production of diacylglycerol (DAG) but not IP 3 is essential for Ang II-induced NFAT activation in rat cardiac myocytes. NFAT activation and hypertrophic responses by Ang II stimulation required the enhanced frequency of Ca 2 + oscillation triggered by membrane depolarization through activation of DAG-sensitive TRPC channels, which leads to activation of L-type Ca 2 + <b>channel.</b> <b>Patch</b> clamp recordings from single myocytes revealed that Ang II activated DAG-sensitive TRPC-like currents.

Results We recorded currents of P 2 X 2 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes from outside-out patches and have found that currents recorded from patches containing a single or multiple P 2 X 2 channels differ in a manner suggesting positive cooperativity. First, the currents from multichannel patches exhibit simultaneous transitions more frequently than predicted from the activity of independent channels. Second, the mean open lifetime at {{the current level of}} a single channel in a multichannel burst is about six times longer than the open time of currents from single <b>channel</b> <b>patches,</b> a trend opposite to what is expected of independent channels. These results indicate that the channels have positive cooperativity and that the longer opening is due to a slower closing rate. Third, from kinetic analysis the likelihood of the cooperative model is significantly larger than that of the independent model. Fourth, the open channel noise of currents from <b>patches</b> containing multiple <b>channels</b> is less than half that from a single channel, which is consistent with the channel properties being different when they are active in groups.

40|$|Calcium microdomains {{generated}} by tight clusters of calcium channels regulate fusion of small vesicles at the synaptic terminal and {{have also been}} suggested to trigger exocytosis of large dense-core vesicles from neuroendocrine cells. To test this idea, we have compared sites of exocytosis and the spatial distribution of calcium channels in chromaffin cells. Fusion of individual vesicles was visualized using interference reflection microscopy and the submembranous calcium signal was assessed using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Depolarization triggered a burst of exocytosis from up to seven sites in a membrane area of 11 μm 2, but these sites did not colocalize with calcium microdomains. Instead, calcium influx occurred in large patches (averaging 34 μm 2) containing a mixture of P/Q- and N-type channels. About 20 % of fusion events occurred outside calcium <b>channel</b> <b>patches.</b> Further, the delay between the onset of stimulation and a burst of exocytosis was prolonged for several seconds by increasing the concentration of the slow calcium chelator EGTA from 1. 5 to 5 mm.

There is also good agreement between values of cell membrane resistance obtained by the microelectrode technique, the whole cell patch clamp technique, and the single <b>channel</b> <b>patch</b> clamp technique. These results indicate that our microelectrode measurements are not dominated by leak-induced artifacts, and that the spontaneous membrane potential activity is not induced by Ca 2 + leakage around the microelectrode. The spontaneous membrane potential activity is eliminated {{in the presence of}} the Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187, also in serum-free medium, and by K+ and Ca 2 + channel blockers, but it is not affected by the hyperpolarizing responses to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and dibutyryl cAMP, which persist under all of these conditions. These results support the hypothesis that the spontaneous membrane potential activity is related to repeated fluctuations of internal [Ca 2 +] and that such fluctuations result from a feedback loop involving Ca 2 + channels or Ca 2 + pumps in the cell membrane.

In wetlands and <b>channels,</b> <b>patches</b> of vegetation are rarely isolated and neighboring patches influence one another during their development. In this experimental study, an adjacent pair of emergent vegetation patches were modeled by circular arrays of cylinders with their centers aligned in a direction that was perpendicular to the flow direction. The flow and deposition patterns behind the pair of patches were measured for two stem densities and for different patch separations (gap widths). The wake pattern immediately behind each individual patch was similar to that observed behind an isolated patch, with a velocity minimum directly behind each patch that produced a well-defined region of enhanced deposition in line with the patch. For all gap widths (Δ), the velocity on the centerline between the patches (U[subscript c]) was elevated to a peak velocity U[subscript max] that persisted over a distance L[subscript j]. Although U[subscript max] was not a function of Δ, L[subscript j] decreased with decreasing Δ. Beyond L[subscript j], the wakes merged and U[subscript c] decayed to a local minimum. The merging of wakes and associated velocity minimum produced a local maximum in deposition downstream from and on the centerline between the patches. If this secondary region of enhanced deposition promotes new vegetation growth, the increased drag on the centerline could slow velocity between the upstream patch pair, leading to conditions favorable to their merger.

Using a wide range of techniques including dynamic two photon imaging, whole-cell or single <b>channel</b> <b>patch</b> clamp recording in slices from Nkx 2. 1 -GFP mice, we now report a silencing of MSNs that timely coincides with locomotion. At embryonic stage (as early as E 16) and during early postnatal days, genetically identified MSNs have a depolarized resting membrane potential, a high input resistance and lack both inward rectifying (IKIR) and early slowly decaying (ID) potassium currents. They generate intrinsic voltage-gated clustered calcium activity without synaptic components. From postnatal days 5 to 7, the striatal network transiently generates synapse-driven giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) when activation of cortical inputs evokes long lasting EPSCs in MSNs. Both are mediated by NR 2 C/D-receptors. These immature features are abruptly replaced by adult ones before P 10 : MSNs express IKIR and ID and generate short lasting, time-locked corticostriatal AMPA/NMDA EPSCs with no NR 2 C/D component. This shift parallels the onset of quadruped motion by the pup. Therefore, MSNs generate immature patterns that are timely shut off to enable the coordination of motor programs...|$|E
40|$|CLC-type {{chloride}} channels {{exhibit a}} unique double-barreled architecture with two independently functioning ion conduction pathways, the so-called protopores. There exist gating processes that {{open and close}} individual protopores as well as common processes that jointly mediate slow opening and closing of both protopores. Different isoforms exhibit distinct voltage dependences and kinetics of gating. Whereas opening {{of the individual and}} common gate of homo-dimeric ClC- 1 is promoted by membrane depolarization, ClC- 2 is closed at positive potentials and opens only at negative voltages. To characterize the functional interaction of protopores we engineered a concatameric construct linking the coding regions of ClC- 1 and ClC- 2 in an open reading frame, expressed it in mammalian cells and measured anion currents through whole-cell and single <b>channel</b> <b>patch</b> clamping. In the hetero-dimeric assembly, each protopore displayed two kinetically distinct gating processes. Fast gating of the ClC- 1 protopore closely resembled fast protopore gating of homo-dimeric channels. The voltage dependence of ClC- 2 fast gating was shifted to more positive potentials by the adjacent ClC- 1 protopore, resulting in open ClC- 2 protopores at positive voltages. We observed two slow gating processes individually acting on ClC- 1 and ClC- 2 protopores, with distinct time and voltage dependences. Single channel recordings demonstrated that hetero-dimerization additionally modified the unitary conductance of ClC- 2 protopores. Our findings suggest that inter-subunit interactions do not only affect common gating, but also ion permeation and gating of individual protopores in hetero-dimeric ClC channels...|$|E
40|$|Sodium {{currents}} {{were recorded}} from frog skeletal muscle by using fire-polished micropipettes to electrically isolate and voltage clamp {{a small patch}} of sarcolemma. Sodium current amplitude served as an assay for the number of functional sodium <b>channels</b> in the <b>patch.</b> With the pipette as a light guide, these channels were irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light directed through a quartz fiber into the back end of the pipette. The UV light emerging from the pipette tip caused localized destruction of the sodium <b>channels</b> in the <b>patch,</b> reducing sodium current 3 - to 5 -fold during a 30 - 90 s irradiation. If sodium channels could diffuse laterally in the membrane, current from the patch should recover with time as fresh channels enter from neighboring areas. No such recovery was observed during observation for 1 hr after irradiation. Our results set an upper limit of 10 (- 12) cm 2 /s for the diffusion coefficient [...] 1 / 1000 th that of rhodopsin, a membrane protein in the cell membrane of retinal rods. It is suggested that sodium channels are anchored in the sarcolemma...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} {{glutathione}} were studied on the gating behaviour of sodium <b>channels</b> in membrane <b>patches</b> of rat axons. Depolarizing pulses from- 120 to- 40 mV elicited sodium currents {{of up to}} 500 pA, indicating the simultaneous activation of up to 250 sodium channels. Inactivation of these channels in the excised, inside-out configuration was fitted by two time constants (rhl = 0. 81 ms; rhZ = 5. 03 ms) and open time histograms at 0 mV revealed a biexpo-nential distribution of channel openings (7 "shot t = 0. 28 ms; rlong = 3. 68 ms). Both, the slow time constant of inactivation and the long lasting single channel openings disappeared after addition of the reducing agent glutathione (2 - 5 mM) to the bathing solution. Sodium <b>channels</b> of excised <b>patches</b> with glutathione present on the cytoplasmatic face of the membrane had inactivation kinetics similar to channels recorded in the cell-attached configuration. These observations indicate that redox processes {{may contribute to the}} gating of axonal sodium channels.

40|$|Segment-specific {{expression}} of 2 P domain potassium channel genes in human nephron. BackgroundThe 2 P domain potassium (K 2 P) channels are a recently discovered ion channel superfamily. Structurally, K 2 P channels are distinguished {{by the presence}} of two pore forming loops within one channel subunit. Functionally, they are characterized by their ability to pass potassium across the physiologic voltage range. Thus, K 2 P channels are also called open rectifier, background, or leak potassium <b>channels.</b> <b>Patch</b> clamp studies of renal tubules have described several open rectifier potassium channels that have as yet eluded molecular identification. We sought to determine the segment-specific {{expression of}} transcripts for the 14 known K 2 P channel genes in human nephron to identify potential correlates of native leak channels. MethodsHuman kidney samples were obtained from surgical cases and specific nephron segments were dissected. RNA was extracted and used as template for the generation of cDNA libraries. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (TaqMan®) was used to analyze gene expression. ResultsWe found significant (P < 0. 05) expression of K 2 P 10 in glomerulus, K 2 P 5 in proximal tubule and K 2 P 1 in cortical thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (cTAL) and in distal nephron segments. In addition, we repeatedly detected message for several other K 2 P channels with less abundance, including K 2 P 3 and K 2 P 6 in glomerulus, K 2 P 10 in proximal tubule, K 2 P 5 in thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, and K 2 P 3, K 2 P 5, and K 2 P 13 in distal nephron segments. ConclusionK 2 P channels are expressed in specific segments of human kidney. These results provide a step toward assigning K 2 P channels to previously described native renal leaks...|$|R
