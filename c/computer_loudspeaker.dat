5000|$|A third {{method is}} a {{response}} to the deficiencies of the first two methods. It uses a smaller (e.g., 10 ohm) series resistor and measurements are made of the voltage across the driver, the signal generator, and/or series resistor for frequencies around resonance. Although tedious, and not often used in manual measurements, simple calculations exist which allow the true impedance magnitude and phase to be determined. This is the method used by many <b>computer</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> measurement systems. When this method is used manually, the result of taking the three measurements is that their ratios are more important than their actual value, removing the effect of poor meter frequency response ...|$|E

40|$|The set {{of audio}} {{treatment}} methods {{commonly used in}} the mastering process of commercial music tend to increase the loudness perception of the final audio product, obtaining a “fat ” sound that can be played with sufficient quality on low level audio devices, such as small radios or <b>computer</b> <b>loudspeaker.</b> The side effect of these audio processes are the loss of transients and dynamic variations, with a resulting “flat ” sound. The widely diffused compressed audio formats (mp 3, wma) introduce further degradation of the recorded music. In this paper we describe a method for time domain transient enhancement of recorded music, which can be easily implemented with low-cost Digital Signal Processors in stand alone device or included in HW (iPod like) or SW (Winamp like) audio player applications. 1...|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{educational}} software for intuitive {{understanding of the}} basic dynamic processes of semiconductor lasers is presented. The proposed tool is addressed to the students of optical communication courses, encouraging self consolidation of the subjects learned in lectures. The semiconductor laser model {{is based on the}} well known rate equations for the carrier density, photon density and optical phase. The direct modulation of the laser is considered with input parameters which can be selected by the user. Different options for the waveform, amplitude and frequency of the injected current are available, together with the bias point. Simulation results are plotted for carrier density and output power versus time. Instantaneous frequency variations of the laser output are numerically shifted to the audible frequency range and sent to the <b>computer</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b> This results in an intuitive description of the “chirp ” phenomenon due to amplitude-phase coupling, typical of directly modulated semiconductor lasers. In this way, the student can actually listen to the time resolved spectral content of the laser output. By changing the laser parameters and/or the modulation parameters, consequent variation of the laser output can be appreciated in intuitive manner. The proposed educational tool has been previously implemented by the same authors with locally executable software. In the present manuscript, we extend our previous work to a web based platform, offering improved distribution and allowing its use to the wide audience of the web...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to estimate the impulse response of a filter that describes the transformation in sound that takes place between a close-mic recording of a vehicle engine {{and the sound of}} the same engine at another point in or near to the vehicle. The proposed method makes use of the Dual Channel FFT Analysis technique and does not require the use of <b>loudspeakers,</b> <b>computer</b> modelling or mechanical devices. Instead, a minimum of two microphones is required and the engine itself is used as the source of sound. This is potentially useful for virtual reality applications or in sound design for computer games, where users select their virtual position at points inside or outside the vehicle. A case study is described to examine the method in practice and the results are discussed. The described method can be readily extended for surround sound applications using spatial microphone array recording techniques...|$|R
40|$|This papers {{deals with}} a 3 -D audio system that has been {{developed}} for desktop multimedia environments. The system {{has the ability to}} place virtual sources at arbitrary azimuths and elevations around the listener's head based on HRTF binaural synthesis. A listener seated in front of a <b>computer</b> and two <b>loudspeakers</b> placed at each side of the monitor have been considered. Transaural reproduction using loudspeakers has been used for rendering the sound field to listener ears. Furthermore the system can cope with slight movements of the listener head. Head position is monitored by means of a simple computer vision algorithm. Four head position coordinates (x,y,z,f) in order to allow free movements of the listener are continuously estimated. Cross-talk cancellation filters and virtual sources locations are updated depending on these head coordinates. 1.

In Chapter 2, the research begun in {{the most important and}} most widely used neural network algorithm for logical operations: AND, OR, and XOR using a three-layer neural network structure is discussed. Different levels of noise to the algorithm performance are compared and analyzed from a theoretical and a simulation point of view. In Chapter 3, nonlinear system identifications are discussed and three different system models are used to verify the effectiveness of algorithm and structure.

40|$|OFDM is a {{fast growing}} {{technology}} {{in the area of}} wireless communication due to its numerous advantages and applications. The current and future technologies in the area of wireless communications like WiMAX, WiFi, LTE, MBWA and DVB-T uses the OFDM signals. The OFDM technology is applicable to the radio communication as well as the acoustic communication. Though the licensed spectrum is intended to be used only by the spectrum owners, Cognitive radio is a concept of reusing this licensed spectrum in an unlicensed manner. Cognitive radio is motivated by the measurements of spectrum utilization. Cognitive radio must be able to detect very weak primary users signal and to keep the interference level at a maximum acceptable level. Hence spectrum sensing {{is an essential part of}} the cognitive radio. Spectrum is a scarce resource and spectrum sensing is the process of identifying the unused spectrum, without causing any harm to the existing primary user’s signal. The unused spectrum is referred to as spectrum hole or white space and this spectrum hole could be reused by the cognitive radio. This thesis work focuses on implementing primary acoustic transmitter to transmit the OFDM signals from a <b>computer</b> through <b>loudspeaker</b> and receive the signals through a microphone. Then by applying different detection methods on the received OFDM signal for detection of the spectrum hole, the performance of these detection methods is compared here. The commonly used detection methods are power spectrum estimation, energy detection and second–order statistics (GLRT approach, Autocorrelation Function (ACF) detection and cyclostationary feature detection). The detector based on GLRT approach exploits the structure of the OFDM signal by using the second order statistics of the received data. The thesis mainly focuses on GLRT approach and ACF detectors and compare their performance...|$|R
