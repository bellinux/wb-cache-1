40|$|A {{phase lock}} loop is a {{closed-loop}} system that causes one system to track with another. More precisely, a PLL can {{be perceived as a}} circuit synchronizing an output signal with a reference or input signal in frequency as well as phase. High-performance {{phase lock loop}}s are widely used within a digital system for <b>clock</b> generation, <b>timing</b> <b>recovery,</b> and to efficiently sequence operations and synchronize between function units and ICs As the digital system grows the role of phase lock loop increases. Achieving low jitter and phase noise in phase lock loop with less area and power consumption is challenging. The present research relates to characterization and redesign of individual blocks of Phase lock loop (PLL) to improve its characteristics. More specifically redesigning of individual blocks like: Phase Frequency Detector to reduce area and static phase error, Voltage to Current converter to linearly increase the current input to the current controlled oscillator, Current Controlled Oscillator to reduce phase noise, amplitude distortion, area and power consumption. We also introduce an additional feedback loop to increase the gain of the charge pump in a manner that linearizes the overall loop gain over wide bandwidth.

In many applications PLL’s are embedded into larger digital systems, in consequence, analogue test access is often limited. Test motivation is thus towards methods that can either aid digital only test of the PLL, or alternatively facilitate complete self testing of the PLL. One useful characterisation technique used by PLL designers is that of closed loop phase transfer function measurement. This test allows, an estimation of the PLL’s natural frequency, damping, and 3 dB bandwidth to be made from the magnitude and phase response plots. These parameters relate directly to the time domain response of the PLL and will indicate errors in the PLL circuitry. This paper provides suggestions towards test methods that use a novel maximum frequency detection technique to aid automatic measurement of the closed loop phase transfer function. In addition, techniques presented have potential for full BIST applications. Keywords: PLL, CP-PLL, BIST, TEST, DfT. 1...|$|R

40|$|Digital {{communication}} systems invariably employ an underlying analog communication channel. At the transmitter, data is modulated {{to obtain an}} analog waveform which is input to the channel. At the receiver, {{the output of the}} channel needs to be mapped back into the discrete domain. To this effect, the continuous-time received waveform is sampled at instants chosen by the <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> block. Therefore, <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> is an essential component of digital {{communication systems}}. A widely used <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> method is based on a phase-locked loop (PLL), which updates its timing estimates based on a decision-directed device. Timing recovery performance is a strong function of the reliability of decisions, and hence, of the channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Iteratively decodable error-control codes (ECCs) like turbo codes and LDPC codes allow operation at SNRs lower than ever before, thus exacerbating <b>timing</b> <b>recovery.</b> We propose iterative <b>timing</b> <b>recovery,</b> where the <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> block, the equalizer and the ECC decoder exchange information, giving the <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> block access to decisions that are much more reliable than the instantaneous ones. This provides significant SNR gains at a marginal complexity penalty over a conventional turbo equalizer where the equalizer and the ECC decoder exchange information. We also derive the Cramer-Rao bound, which is a lower bound on the estimation error variance of any timing estimator, and propose <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> methods that outperform the conventional PLL and achieve the Cramer-Rao bound in some cases. At low SNR, <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> suffers from cycle slips, where the receiver drops or adds one or more symbols, and consequently, almost always the ECC decoder fails to decode. Iterative <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> has the ability to corrects cycle slips. To reduce the number of iterations, we propose cycle slip detection and correction methods. With iterative <b>timing</b> <b>recovery,</b> the PLL with cycle slip detection and correction recovers most of the SNR loss of the conventional receiver that separates <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> and turbo equalization.

40|$|Timing {{recovery}} is {{the processing of}} synchronizing the sampler with the received analog signal. Sampling at the wrong times can have a devastating impact on performance. Conventional <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> techniques {{are based on a}} decision-directed phase-locked loop (PLL). They are adequate only when the operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is sufficiently high, but recent advances in error-control coding have made it possible to communicate reliably at very low SNR, where conventional techniques fail. This thesis develops new techniques for <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> that are capable of working at low SNR. We propose a new <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> scheme based on per-survivor processing (PSP), which jointly performs <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> and equalization, by embedding a separate PLL into each survivor of a Viterbi algorithm. The proposed scheme is shown to perform better than conventional scheme, especially when the SNR is low and the timing error is large. An important advantage of this technique is its amenability to real-time implementation. We also propose a new iterative <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> scheme that exploits the presence of the error-control code; in doing so, it can perform even better than the PSP scheme described above, but at the expense of increased complexity and the requirement of batch processing. This scheme is realized by embedding the <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> process into a trellis-based soft-output equalizer using PSP. Then, this module iteratively exchanges soft information with the error-control decoder, as in conventional turbo equalization. The resulting system jointly performs the functions of <b>timing</b> <b>recovery,</b> equalization, and decoding. The proposed iterative <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> scheme is shown to perform better than previously reported iterative <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> schemes, especially when the timing error is severe. Finally, performance analysis of iterative <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> schemes is difficult because of their high complexity.
