40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{stabilization}} {{and control of}} mechanical, mechantronic systems. Such dynamical systems usually contain several non-linearities which are essential. Linearization of the design model <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> often <b>done,</b> because the discussed systems usually perform large motions in state space. Along these trajectories unacceptable differences between linearized model and real system occur. Thus the non-linear control and stabilization techniques are investigated in this thesis. There are 2 approaches introduced. The 1 st one is based on fuzzy logic theory. Until now fuzzy control has been designed ad-hoc. But the developed approach of fuzzy controller design is systematic. The algorithm is based on generalization of the MOPO method. The 2 nd approach is based on optimal control theory. The design algorithm is developed for broad class of non-linear systems. Stability of this control design approach has been studied as well. The described methods are demonstrated on several case studies.

60|$|There is {{a radical}} {{distinction}} between controlling the business of government and actually doing it. The same person or body {{may be able to}} control every thing, but can not possibly do every thing; and in many cases its control over every thing will be more perfect the less it personally attempts to do. The commander of an army could not direct its movements effectually if he himself fought in the ranks or led an assault. It is the same with bodies of men. Some things <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> except by bodies; other things can not be well done by them. It is one question, therefore, what a popular assembly should control, another what it should itself do. It should, as we have already seen, control all the operations of government. But, in order to determine through what channel this general control may most expediently be exercised, and what portion of the business of government the representative assembly should hold in its own hands, it is necessary to consider what kinds of business a numerous body is competent to perform properly. That alone which it can do well it ought to take personally upon itself. With regard to the rest, its proper province is not to do it, but to take means for having it well done by others.|$|E

I said I had been remarking at home, à propos of the London, that I knew of no shipwreck of a large strong ship (not carrying weight of guns) in the open sea, and that I could find none such in the shipwreck books. They all agreed that the unfortunate Captain Martin must have been unacquainted with the truth as to what can and what <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> with a Steamship having rigging and canvas; and that no sailor would dream of turning a ship's stern to such a gale--unless his vessel could run faster than the sea. ---- said (and the other two confirmed) that the London was the better for everything that she lost aloft in such a gale, and that with her head kept to the wind by means of a storm topsail--which is hoisted from the deck and requires no man to be sent aloft, and can be set under the worst circumstances--the disaster could not have occurred. If he had no such sail, he could have improvised it, even of hammocks and the like. They said that under a Board of Enquiry into the wreck, any efficient witness must of necessity state this as the fact, and could not possibly avoid the conclusion that the seamanship was utterly bad; and as to the force of the wind, for which I suggested allowance, they all had been in West Indian hurricanes and in Typhoons, and had put the heads of their ships to the wind under the most adverse circumstances.|$|E

PPP as one form of risk sharing in infrastructure investment should not release the role and government support to private parties / investors.

So, in a perfect world, we would like to implement applications using a general purpose programming language, but use a set of different DSL to handle specific domains' tasks.
