5|$|Calvin {{provided}} many of {{the foundational}} documents for reformed churches, including documents on the catechism, the liturgy, and church governance. He also produced several confessions of faith in order to unite the churches. In 1559, he drafted the French <b>confession</b> <b>of</b> faith, the Gallic Confession, and the synod in Paris accepted it with few changes. The Belgic <b>Confession</b> <b>of</b> 1561, a Dutch <b>confession</b> <b>of</b> faith, was partly based on the Gallic Confession.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the denomination's existence, {{theological}} battles were {{fought over}} how the <b>Confession</b> <b>of</b> Faith would be interpreted. During the 19th century, Old School Presbyterians insisted that the Confession be interpreted according to strict Calvinism, while the New School Presbyterians favored a looser interpretation. From 1910 to 1927, the <b>Confession</b> <b>of</b> Faith was officially interpreted with reference to five fundamental beliefs: biblical inerrancy, the virgin birth, substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection, and the miracles of Christ.|$|E

5|$|Wittgenstein {{believed}} {{that religion is}} significant because it offers a particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God.

Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of McCarthy's speech, {{communism}} was a significant concern in the United States. This concern was exacerbated {{by the actions of}} the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, the victory of the communists in the Chinese Civil War, the Soviets' development of a nuclear weapon the year before, and by the contemporary controversy surrounding Alger Hiss and the <b>confession</b> <b>of</b> Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs. With this background and due to the sensational nature of McCarthy's charge against the State Department, the Wheeling speech soon attracted a flood of press interest in McCarthy's claim.|$|E
5|$|In {{her next}} letter Hańska made {{arrangements}} for a trusted courier to collect letters from Balzac, and thereby {{allow for a}} direct correspondence.

They would also travel to the Swiss village of Neuchâtel, to visit the family of her daughter's governess. Contradicting her vow of eternal anonymity, she suggested a meeting.

5|$|Scholars {{divide the}} {{ministry}} of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the Judaean Desert after rebuffing the temptation of Satan. Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in , his first disciples, who will eventually form {{the core of the}} early Church, encounter him and begin to travel with him. This period includes the Sermon on the Mount, one of Jesus' major discourses, as well as the calming of the storm, the feeding of the 5,000, walking on water {{and a number of other}} miracles and parables. It ends with the <b>Confession</b> <b>of</b> Peter and the Transfiguration.|$|E
5|$|The Presbyterian Church in the USA was {{organized}} according to presbyterian polity.

5|$|A <b>Confession</b> <b>of</b> Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record {{of the actions of}} the Assembly during the writing of the Confession, it is clear that there were {{significant}} debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.|$|E

5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a <b>confession</b> <b>of</b> that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had wanted}} to study for a {{doctorate}} and proceed with a career in archaeology, Buczynski was dying. He became ill with the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which took advantage of his weakened immune system. He suffered partial paralysis on his right side as well as brain lesions, leaving him irritable and withdrawn, and required hospitalization. Upon release, he moved to Atlanta to be with Muto in January 1989. By this stage, he was unable to attend to basic tasks on his own, including eating and dressing himself, and required almost constant care, from both Muto and from carers based at St. Joseph Hospital. He began to talk with the hospital's Roman Catholic priest and finally decided to return to the faith of his birth, undertaking his <b>confession</b> <b>of</b> reconciliation in February. In March, his condition deteriorated, and he was admitted to the hospital, where he fell into a coma and died on the morning on Thursday, March 16.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the urge to {{identify}} scapegoats for the fire is {{the acceptance of the}} <b>confession</b> <b>of</b> a simple-minded French watchmaker named Robert Hubert, who claimed that he was an agent of the Pope and had started the Great Fire in Westminster. He later changed his story to say that he had started the fire at the bakery in Pudding Lane. Hubert was convicted, despite some misgivings about his fitness to plead, and hanged at Tyburn on 28 September 1666. After his death, it became apparent that he had been on board a ship in the North Sea, and had not arrived in London until two days after the fire started. These allegations that Catholics had started the fire were exploited as powerful political propaganda by opponents of pro-Catholic Charles II's court, mostly during the Popish Plot and the exclusion crisis later in his reign.|$|E
