She opposes the Trans Pacific Partnership (a switch from being for it), supports a higher minimum wage (she has said she supports a $12 minimum wage, but would sign a $15 minimum wage if it passed through Congress; Obama has said he supports a $10.10 minimum wage), and Hillary had a more liberal voting record in the Senate than Obama, according to Vox.|$|E

Despite his promise, <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> sure where he will get the support money for Ruth, and is anxious about his job security.

We would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in history." [...] Unlike Sanders, <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a supporter of the Nordic model, saying in the same debate: [...] "We are not Denmark.

40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom in American politics {{has long been}} that {{someone who is not}} religious cannot be elected president of the United States. Most Americans have consistently said {{that it is important to}} them that the president have strong religious beliefs. And a new Pew Research Center survey finds that being an atheist remains one of the biggest liabilities that a presidential candidate can have; fully half of American adults say they would be less likely to vote for a hypothetical presidential candidate who does not believe in God, while just 6 % say they would be more likely to vote for a nonbeliever. On the other hand, the share of American adults who say they would be less likely to vote for an atheist candidate has been declining over time. Moreover, one of the candidates who is widely viewed by Republicans as a potentially "good" or "great" president, Donald Trump, is not widely viewed as a religious person, even by those in his own party. And on the Democratic side, the share of Americans who say Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a religious person now stands at 43 %, which is sharply higher than it was in the summer of 2007, when she was seeking the presidential nomination for the first time. These are among the key findings of a new Pew Research Center survey conducted Jan. 7 - 14, 2016, on landlines and cellphones among a national sample of 2, 009 adults. This is the latest in a long line of research the Center has conducted on the role of religion in presidential campaigns...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Title:CLINTON VS TRUMP -An {{investigation}} {{of how the}} leadership of US presidential candidates is being designed discursively in Metro and Dagens Nyheter Author: Ewelina Bosak & Sandra Stefanovic In 2016 {{a man and a}} woman competed for the first time in history in becoming the President of the United States. In 2016 one could read about the American presidential election every day in any newspaper. With this in mind, we want to examine the leadership being applied to the candidates by the news sources Metro and Dagens Nyheter. As leadership traditionally is considered a masculine feature, we apply a gender perspective to this study. The questions we intend to answer: - What discourse is construed by Metro and Dagens Nyheter regarding the leadership of Clinton and Trump? - How are Clinton and Trump being portrayed from a gender perspective? We used the method of discourse analysis, as it advocates the principle of language being the primary tool in shaping our realities. The theoretical framework we use to interpret and explain our results is based on discourse theory as well as the social construction of age and gender. Our research shows that Trump is generally being portrayed in a way not considered to be "right" in accordance to the leadership- or age norm. The discourse of Trump presents him as an inexperienced, dishonest and attempted leader with an childish behaviour. Trump is also often described through typically considered feminine features. Clinton, being perceived as almost invisible and often depicted in comparison to Trump or other male leaders, is at the same time portrayed as a successful, experienced, driven and intelligent leader. However, we have discovered that in spite of Clinton’s described leadership features she is constantly also criticised for being cold and not evoking any feelings or engagement. <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> only being questioned on the basis of the masculine leadership norms, but also on the lack characteristics in line with the feminine norm...|$|E
