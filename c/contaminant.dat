The <b>contaminants</b> described in this overview are various metals (Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn) and various organic <b>contaminants</b> (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and lindane (hexachlorocyclohexane, γ-HCH)). In addition, information is presented about other and emerging <b>contaminants</b> such as antifouling biocides (e. g. TBT and Irgarol), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), poly- and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). Special attention is given to biogeochemical processes {{that contribute to the}} mobilization of <b>contaminants</b> in the surface sediments of the Wadden Sea. Finally, the effects on organisms of <b>contaminants</b> are reviewed and discussed. The main source of <b>contaminants</b> in the Wadden Sea are the rivers Rhine (via de Dutch coastal zone), Elbe and Weser. The Wadden Sea is not a sink for <b>contaminants</b> and adsorbed <b>contaminants</b> are transported from east to west. The surface sediments of the Wadden Sea are an important source for <b>contaminants</b> to the water above. The input and concentration of most <b>contaminants</b> have significantly decreased in water, sediments, organisms (e. g., mussel, flounder and bird eggs) {{in various parts of the}} Wadden Sea in the last three decades. Remarkably, the Cd concentration in mussels is increasing the last decades. In recent decades, the effects of <b>contaminants</b> on organisms (e. g., flounder, seal) have fallen markedly. Most of the affected populations have recovered, except for TBT induced effects in snails. Little is known about the concentration and effects of most emerging <b>contaminants</b> and the complex environmental mixtures of <b>contaminants.</b> It is recommended to install an international coordinated monitoring programme for <b>contaminants</b> and their effects in the whole Wadden Sea and to identify the chemical <b>contaminants</b> that really cause the effect. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|AbstractFreshwater {{ecosystems}} {{are threatened by}} multiple anthropogenic stressors, which might be differentiated into two types: those that reduce biological activity at all concentrations (toxic <b>contaminants),</b> and those that subsidize biological activity at low concentrations and reduce it at high concentrations (assimilable <b>contaminants).</b> When occurring in mixtures, these <b>contaminants</b> can have either antagonistic, neutral or synergistic effects; but little is known on their joint effects. We assessed the interaction effects of a mixture of assimilable and toxic <b>contaminants</b> on stream biofilms in a manipulative experiment using artificial streams, and following a factorial design with three nutrient levels (low, medium or high) and either {{presence or absence of}} a mixture of emerging <b>contaminants</b> (ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diclofenac, methylparaben, and sulfamethoxazole). We measured biofilm biomass, basal fluorescence, gross primary production and community respiration. Our initial hypotheses were that biofilm biomass and activity would: increase with medium nutrient concentrations (subsidy effect), but decrease with high nutrient concentrations (stress effect) (i); decrease with emerging <b>contaminants,</b> with the minimum decrease at medium nutrient concentrations (antagonistic interaction between nutrients subsidy and stress by emerging <b>contaminants)</b> and the maximum decrease at high nutrient concentrations (synergistic interaction between nutrients and emerging <b>contaminants</b> stress) (ii). All the measured variables responded linearly to the available nutrients, with no toxic effect at high nutrient concentrations. Emerging <b>contaminants</b> only caused weak toxic effects in some of the measured variables, and only after 3 – 4 weeks of exposure. Therefore, only antagonistic interactions were observed between nutrients and emerging <b>contaminants,</b> as medium and high nutrient concentrations partly compensated the harmful effects of emerging <b>contaminants</b> during the first weeks of the experiment. Our results show that <b>contaminants</b> with a subsidy effect can alleviate the effects of toxic <b>contaminants,</b> and that long-term experiments are required to detect stress effects of emerging <b>contaminants</b> at environmentally relevant concentrations...|$|R
5|$|Research {{and studies}} were {{initiated}} {{to find a}} safe method to destroy the materials and it was discovered they could be incinerated safely under special conditions of temperature and dwell time. However, these herbicides were expensive and the Air Force wanted to resell its surplus instead of dumping it at sea. Among many methods tested, a possibility of salvaging the herbicides by reprocessing and filtering out the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) <b>contaminant</b> with carbonized (charcoaled) coconut fibers.

The brittle titanium around the impurity then cracked during forging and fell out during final machining, leaving a cavity with microscopic cracks at the edges. For the next 18 years, the cracks all grew slightly each time the engine was powered up and brought to operating temperature and finally broke open, causing the disk to fail.|$|E

Several Guam veterans have collected {{an enormous amount of}} evidence to assist in their disability claims for direct exposure to dioxin containing herbicides such as 2,4,5-T which are similar to the illness associations and disability coverage that has become standard for those who were harmed by the same chemical <b>contaminant</b> of Agent Orange used in Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, an {{independent}} Health Advisory Panel - appointed by then-Governor Roy Romer - oversaw {{a series of}} reports, called the Historical Public Exposure Studies. The 12-member Health Advisory Panel included multiple medical doctors, scientists, PhDs, and local officials. The Rocky Flats Historical Public Exposure Studies involved nine years of research. The Studies had three main objectives: (1) create a public record of plant operations and accidents that contributed to <b>contaminant</b> releases from the Rocky Flats Plant between 1952 and 1989; (2) assess public exposures to contaminants and potential risks from past releases; and, (3) determine the need for future studies. The Studies' research included identification and assessment of chemicals and radioactive materials from past releases; estimates of risk to residents living or working in surrounding communities during the Plant's operation from 1952 to 1989; an evaluation of possible exposure pathways; and, dose assessments for historical releases.|$|E

Later research demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of violent criminals), the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E

Benthic invertebrates are swamped when the oil sinks, fish are poisoned, and the food chain is disrupted. In the short term, oil spills result in wildlife populations being decreased and unbalanced, leisure activities being affected, and the livelihoods of people dependent on the sea being devastated.

25|$|The {{retardation}} {{factor is}} another very important feature {{that make the}} motion of the <b>contaminant</b> to deviate from the average groundwater motion. It is analogous to the retardation factor of chromatography. Unlike diffusion and dispersion, which simply spread the <b>contaminant,</b> the retardation factor changes its global average velocity, {{so that it can be}} much slower than that of water. This is due to a chemico-physical effect: the adsorption to the soil, which holds the <b>contaminant</b> back and does not allow it to progress until the quantity corresponding to the chemical adsorption equilibrium has been adsorbed. This effect is particularly important for less soluble contaminants, which thus can move even hundreds or thousands times slower than water. The effect of this phenomenon is that only more soluble species can cover long distances. The retardation factor depends on the chemical nature of both the <b>contaminant</b> and the aquifer.|$|E
