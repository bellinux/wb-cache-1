40|$|The aim of {{this study}} focuses on the {{relationship}} between walking activity and <b>cultural</b> <b>facilities.</b> Recently, the researches on <b>cultural</b> <b>facilities</b> were found numerously in the directions of public cultural locations, dimensions of improvement, operation systems, and development. On the other hands, it is hard to find any research which is directly focused on the relationship between walking activity and <b>cultural</b> <b>facilities.</b> Therefore, the association factors between walking activity and <b>cultural</b> <b>facilities</b> in Seoul city are raised as the main discussion for this research. The data of New Address Project Database were gathered from Ministry of Security and Public Administration and Walking Activity Survey Data from The Seoul Institute. The multiple regression analysis was significantly used for defining the relationship between walking activity and <b>cultural</b> <b>facilities.</b> Finally, the results of this research show the significant value on the relationship between walking activity and <b>cultural</b> <b>facilities</b> which based upon the types of <b>cultural</b> <b>facilities.</b> ? ??? ????? ????????????(12 ????C 18) ? ??? ??? ?? ??????, 2013 ?

500|$|Soon {{after being}} elected, Williams {{announced}} the province's debts were so burdensome {{that he had}} no choice but to cut spending and freeze wages. Based on the projected $840million budget deficit for 2004, the government announced sweeping cuts. A number of projects would be cut, and others delayed. Cuts included three health care facilities and a school; delayed projects included, most notably, the opening of The Rooms, the province's <b>cultural</b> <b>facility</b> that was under construction. Spurred by the administration's announcement of pay-freeze and plan to eliminate 4,000 public sector jobs, a strike was declared among the 20,000 public sector employees two days following the announcement, at midnight April 1, 2004. The strike ended nearly a month later when Williams reneged on a campaign promise and legislated the employees back to work. Later that year the Williams government compressed health and education boards in an attempt for a more efficient delivery of services, a move that still receives criticism in the province.|$|E

2500|$|On November 6, 2003, Mayor Williams {{announced}} that the project had been awarded to the Hines Interests/Archstone/The Georgetown Co. group. The Hines group was chosen because of its track record, its proposal, and because it also {{had a history of}} working with minority-owned businesses. The group's financial package was also superior. The city had been willing to use up to $20 million annually in tax revenues generated by the project to help finance construction. But the Hines-led group was able to secure financing without city assistance, a much more favorable financial deal for the District of Columbia. (In a separate report, however, The Bond Buyer reported that it was yet unclear whether the project would require city financial backing, and that individual projects within the development might use city-issued tax-exempt bonds for funding.) The development group also said it would make a cash payment to the city immediately upon approval of the deal and give the city a portion of the profits from the project, a combined income which city officials said was worth $250 million. The winning proposal included [...] of ground level retail space; 600 apartments and 275 condominiums; [...] of office space; a 200 to 300 room boutique hotel; and a [...] "cultural facility" [...] (whose use was not yet determined) that included a 3,000-seat theater. (At least one report gave the size of the <b>cultural</b> <b>facility</b> as just [...]) Each of the buildings in the project was 11 stories high, and construction was anticipated to begin in late 2005. Hines executives said construction of the project would indirectly contribute $350 million to the local economy, and when complete the development would generate $15 to $20 million a year in property tax revenues for the city.|$|E
