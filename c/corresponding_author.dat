50|$|The DNA {{sequence}} for Escherichia coli {{was first}} published in 1997 and is publicly available to anyone who wanted to use it for research or replicate this work. In addition, the article provides the following figures that show the pieces of DNA that they changed to produce the DSRS system. However, the entire system that they created is not in the article; if one wanted the entire sequence for this system they would have to contact the authors, which is possible through a <b>corresponding</b> <b>author</b> online. This creates a barrier to future research because access to the system is restricted, and {{it is possible that the}} authors could chose to copyright it or otherwise not disclose it to others doing research. This would severely slow the speed at which more DSRS systems can be developed and used to increase yields of biodiesel and other products.|$|E
5000|$|A {{recently}} developed biosynthetic strain of E. Coli {{has been developed}} that covnerts glucose into FAEE biodiesel at 9.4% of the theoretical maximum. This is called the A2A E. Coli strain. The problem with the Escheria Coli was that the A2A strain was unstable and produced “toxic intermediates”. The cell metabolism could not be regulated, creating bottleneck effects or the production of unnecessary proteins. That is where the DSRS came in, stabilizing the cell metabolism and increasing titer and yield. Although this process does increase the yield of biodiesel to 28% (compared to 9.4% without the DSRS), there is a cost associated with implementing the DSRS. Several steps were taken in this process, including construction of FA biosensors, cell culture fluorescence measurement, construction and characterization of hybrid fatty-acid regulated promoters, construction of DSRS into FAEE biosynthetic pathway, and FAEE production and analysis. The {{question is whether or}} not this process is inexpensive enough to be worth the cost in order to increase production threefold. “The need for new transportation fuels that are renewable and can be produced in a sustainable fashion has never been more urgent. Scientific studies have consistently shown that liquid fuels derived from plant biomass are one of the best alternatives if a cost-effective means of commercial production can be found.” [...] Because the market for new fuels is high, the cost of production of biofuels with the DSRS system is likely to lower quickly due to the market forces of supply and demand. Information on the current costs of the production of the DSRS system was not available in the report not through the <b>corresponding</b> <b>author.</b>|$|E
50|$|Description of {{the human}} {{clinical}} phenotype of an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by deficiency of the mitochondrial intermediate presequence protease (MIP), encoded by the gene MIPEP, was first reported by lead author Mohammad Eldomery and senior <b>corresponding</b> <b>author</b> V. Reid Sutton in 2016 in the journal Genome Medicine. The index subject was diagnosed with left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) and Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome at 5 1/2 months of age. In an attempt to identify the etiology of this cardiac phenotype, {{a series of tests}} were performed, including clinical whole exome sequencing. Because the clinical diagnostic laboratory did not identify pathogenic variants in known disease-associated genes, re-analysis of the exome data was performed by Dr. Mohammad Eldomery as part of the Baylor-Johns Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics. Biallelic variants were identified in the MIPEP gene, which was known in yeast and other organisms to be important in mitochondrial protein processing. Because LVNC is seen in other mitochondrial disorders, this was considered the best candidate gene. After interrogating the Baylor Genetic Laboratory clinical database and submitting the MIPEP gene to GeneMatcher, four other affected individuals from three families were identified with biallelic variants in MIPEP. In all cases, the phenotype is LVNC with severe hypotonia and developmental delay. All of the affected individuals, {{with the exception of the}} index case, died before 2 years of age from cardiac failure. Seizures and cataracts were also noted in some of the affected individuals. The MIPEP variants included missense variants, stop variants as well as a 1.4 Megabase deletion involving the MIPEP gene. Confirmation of the pathogenicity of these variants in MIPEP was performed in a yeast model system by Nora Vögtle and Chris Meisinger at the University of Freiburg, Germany.|$|E

5000|$|In June 2010 (though dated May 2010), {{a second}} {{description}} of the new species by Carantón and another biologist in Colombia, Katherine Certuche, appeared in Ornitología Colombiana, {{the journal of the}} Asociación Colombiana de la Ornitología, edited by the ornithologists Carlos Daniel Cadena and F. Gary Stiles. It was accompanied by an editorial describing Stiles's and Cadena's involvement with Carantón and Certuche's paper starting shortly after Fundación ProAves found out about the work. In this account, Cadena attempted to mediate but withdrew because of conflicts with Fundación ProAves. [...] The editorial adds a reason that Carantón's collection of specimens may have been lawful, and notes that in any case, none of the legal accusations against him had been decided by a court. Further, the attempt at joint publication by Carantón, Certuche, and Fundación ProAves scientists failed because Fundación ProAves insisted that Carantón could not be the <b>corresponding</b> <b>author</b> and that Fundación ProAves had to have full control over the final text. After The Condor rejected Carantón and Certuche's manuscript, they submitted it to Ornitología Colombiana, which decided to publish it despite the previous {{description of the}} species. Cadena and Stiles noted that ProAves had not given Carantón the possibility to answer their accusations before they were published and said the description by Barrera and Bartels could be a violation of Carantón's moral rights, which are protected under the Colombian law. They also stated that the description by Barrera and Bartels was in violation of the ICZN Code of Ethics, which Barrera and Bartels denied and in any case the Code of Ethics is part of a section that zoologists are urged to follow (unlike most other sections of the ICZN code, which zoologists have to follow).|$|E
