The algorithm chosen for bad pixel handling is that of[30] with some minor changes. More sophisticated algorithms have been proposed (see for example[31]), but in this article, a simple bad pixel handling {{is assumed to be}} sufficient. Each pixel in the flat field is compared to the median of its neighbors (15 [*]×[*] 15 px kernel). If the absolute deviation from the median is larger than 2.9 standard deviations, it is <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> a <b>bad</b> pixel. Typically, around 3 % are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> (fixed bad pixel map); this is expected and is caused by the special kind of scintillator used. As a third pre-processing step, each pixel labeled <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> is then substituted in the current radiograph by the median value of its neighbors (5 × 5 px kernel). Often, there are clusters of bad pixels, and of course, any indication at the same size and inside such a cluster would be averaged away. In the fourth and final pre-processing step, the pixels are averaged 2 [*]×[*] 2 into pixel size 0.027 mm (binned) to increase the CNR at the cost of resolution.|$|R

Based on this, a method which combines both preprocessing techniques is presented and it outperforms the results obtained with the methods working individually in face recognition under varying lighting conditions. Although the performance is degraded on good quality images, on which the best results are obtained when no preprocessing technique is applied. Then, a method to determine if a face image is affected or not by illumination is also presented in this work and it is used in a general framework for face recognition, in which the combination of preprocessing methods is only applied when the image is <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> illuminated while is directly classified if not, obtaining in this way very good results for both cases, permitting to apply this framework when the illumination conditions are variable and unknown...|$|R

40|$|The {{outstanding}} {{level of}} external debt of non-oil developing countries raises problems of collective {{action on the}} part of lenders. To begin with, there is the issue ofthe appropriate action to ensure the stability of the international banking system. For that we argue that the Federal Reserve System must be ready to extend the lender-of-last-resort service to all banks, domestic and non-domestic, trans-acting in U. S. dollars. But even without immediate danger of a global dollar liquidity crisis, what is the optimal response of lenders as a group? The international banking system can be likened to a club whose cohesiveness depends on one or a few members having the dominant share of benefits and costs, The United States remains the leader of this club,which faces three challenges: moral hazard, adverse selection, and free-riding. The existence of these problems gives lenders incentives to take collective action. A significant part of the outstanding international debt should be <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> loans, for it is unlikely that dollar real interest rates will return to the low levels of the 1970 s. On the other hand, since 1980 these real rates of interest have been unusually high and have prompted undue pessimism about the capacity ofborrowers to repay their debts. International bankers will find itin their own self-interest to lend new funds to some debtor countries to ensure that they can ride out the period of unusually high real interest rates.

At each sampling point water samples were collected at five occasions in the raining season (October - March) and in the dry season (April - June) at three sampling points: (P 1) upstream the solid waste facility, (P 2) downstream nearby the point of influx from the sewage treatment plant in the sanitary landfill, or at the drainage point from the surface flow of the dump and controlled landfill, and (P 3) downstream the solid waste facility. Physicochemical and bacteriological analyses were performed, and the results were analyzed based on descriptive statistics. The data were also compared with reference values from the National Environmental Council (CONAMA) Resolution 357 / 2005 and were used to calculate the water quality index (WQI). It was not possible to detect a significant effect of the solid waste facility on the water quality indicators. The water conditions were unsatisfactory due to violations of the concentrations of phosphorus, ammonia, fecal coliform, and the biochemical oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand ratio (BOD/COD), probably related to other uses along the drainage area upstream the solid waste facility.

40|$|Personal {{stories are}} always {{told in the}} context of broader {{cultural}} narratives. Thus, in the contemporary U. S., stories of personal experience of illness and disability are usually informed by Western notions of health and illness, and a binary classification system of normative/non-normative bodies and behaviors. The emerging field of disability studies represents a socially progressive attempt to interrogate and reconfigure discourses that pathologize and medicalize non-normative bodies, challenging medical discourses with an alternate framework of evidence that emphasizes the personal experiences of individuals who have experienced disability or illness and who conceive of these experiences in different ways. 	 Whose Story Is It Anyway? is an interdisciplinary examination of how the cultural authority of medicine compresses a range of individual experiences into narrow, standardized narratives of the experience of depression, for instance, or other phenomena <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> illness. Specifically, my study makes a three-part argument: first, that biological psychiatry has eclipsed psychoanalysis and that medical definitions of mental illness have become the culturally dominant way of determining what kinds of physical or psychological phenomena are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad,</b> e. g., pathological. Second, these definitions then inform and shape stories of personal experience with such phenomena, enough so that standard narrative formats emerge for describing "individual" experiences of both physical disability and madness/mental illness. The personal stories of madness/mental illness then become, in essence, universalized narratives of illness and recovery that reinforce notions of pathology. Third, this standardization of the personal story often aligns with medical narratives in a way that reflects the storytellers' disempowered position in the medical industry, in that telling the "right" story positions them to receive the benefits of working within the medical system, and telling the "wrong" story becomes an act of political activism. Such de facto coercion has substantial implications for intellectual projects, such as disability studies, that rely heavily on the articulation of personal experience as evidence for the need for change. Finally, this study argues for a re-examination of experience-based, identity-focused activism, and for an invigorated humanities project in science studies...|$|R

Thirty-two lowland small and large lakes sampled using a grab in soft substrate were selected to develop biotic indices. Diversity indices based on species numbers - abundances and indices using species sensitivity values were compared. The lakes selected were all situated in the Alpine Ecoregion below 800 m a. s. l. and had similar chemical composition but different levels of anthropogenic pressure. Lakes with data available in different years were included as separate lakes in the analysis; littoralsublittoral samples of large lakes were also separated from profundal samples yielding a total of 41 sites for analysis. Seven different biotic indices were compared: (1) Shannon diversity index (H), (2) weighted Shannon diversity index (Hw) including in the calculation a sensitivity value assigned to each species, (3) a benthic quality index based on means of three different environmental variables, measuring trophic status, weighted by species abundances (BQITS), (4) an index based on weighted means using a larger set of environmental variables (BQIENV), (5) a modified BQITS, which included both species numbers and total abundance of individuals (BQIES), (6) an index calculated according to a rarefaction method (ES), (7) an index considering indicator species based on experts judgment (BQIEJ). The indices were compared with a trophic status index (TSI) constructed by joining three environmental variables: O 2 % saturation in the hypolimnion during summer stratification, total phosphorous and transparency during full circulation. Comparisons were also made with another environmental stress index (ENI) constructed on {{a larger number of}} variables. All the biotic indices had significant correlations with both TSI and ENI. BQIES, WFD compliant and well correlated with TSI and ENI, was selected to tentatively assign the investigated lakes into 5 quality classes: high (H), good (G), moderate (M), poor (P) and bad (B).
