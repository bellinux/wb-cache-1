For Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf 0 – 1, c-di-GMP impacts the secretion and localization of the adhesin LapA, which is absolutely required for stable surface attachment and biofilm formation by this bacterium. In {{this study we}} characterize LapD, a unique c-di-GMP effector protein that controls biofilm formation by communicating intracellular c-di-GMP levels to the membrane-localized attachment machinery via its periplasmic domain. LapD contains degenerate and enzymatically inactive diguanylate cyclase and c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase (EAL) domains and binds to c-di-GMP through a degenerate EAL domain. We present evidence that LapD utilizes an inside-out signaling mechanism: binding c-di-GMP in the cytoplasm and communicating this signal to the periplasm via its periplasmic domain.

40|$|Gram-negative {{bacteria}} of {{the genus}} Serratia are opportunistic human, plant, and insect pathogens. Serratia sp. strain ATCC 39006 secretes pectinases and cellulases and produces the secondary metabolites carbapenem and prodigiosin. Mutation of a gene (pigX) resulted in an extremely pleiotropic phenotype: prodigiosin antibiotic biosynthesis, plant virulence, and pectinase production were all elevated. PigX controlled secondary metabolism by repressing the transcription of the target prodigiosin biosynthetic operon (pigA-pigO). The transcriptional start site of pigX was determined, and pigX expression occurred in parallel with Pig production. Detailed quantitative intracellular proteome analyses enabled the identification of numerous downstream targets of PigX, including OpgG, mutation of which reduced {{the production of the}} plant cell wall-degrading enzymes and virulence.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the identification and}} functional characterization of cdgB (SCO 4281), a recently discovered target of BldD, a key regulator of morphological differentiation and antibiotic production in the mycelial bacteria of the genus Streptomyces. cdgB (<b>cyclic</b> dimeric <b>GMP</b> [c-di-GMP] B) encodes a GGDEF-containing protein that has diguanylate cyclase activity in vitro. Consistent with this enzymatic activity, heterologous expression of cdgB in Escherichia coli resulted in increased production of extracellular matrix in colonies and enhanced surface attachment of cells in standing liquid cultures. In Streptomyces coelicolor, both overexpression and deletion of cdgB inhibited aerial-mycelium formation, and overexpression also inhibited production of the antibiotic actinorhodin, implicating c-di-GMP in the regulation of developmental processes in Streptomyces. Bis-(3 - 5) -cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) was discovered in 1987 (33).

40|$|Many {{bacteria}} build biofilm matrices using a conserved exopolysaccharide named PGA or PNAG (poly-β- 1, 6 -N-acetyl-D-glucosamine). Interestingly, while E. coli {{and other}} members of the family Enterobacteriaceae encode the pgaABCD operon responsible for PGA synthesis, Salmonella lacks it. The evolutionary force driving this difference remains to be determined. Here, we report that Salmonella lost the pgaABCD operon after the divergence of Salmonella and Citrobacter clades, and previous to the diversification of the currently sequenced Salmonella strains. Reconstitution of the PGA machinery endows Salmonella with the capacity to produce PGA in a <b>cyclic</b> dimeric <b>GMP</b> (c-di-GMP) dependent manner. Outside the host, the PGA polysaccharide does not seem to provide any significant benefit to Salmonella: resistance against chlorine treatment, ultraviolet light irradiation, heavy metal stress and phage infection remained the same as in a strain producing cellulose, the main biofilm exopolysaccharide naturally produced by Salmonella. In contrast, PGA production proved to be deleterious to Salmonella survival inside the host, since it increased susceptibility to bile salts and oxidative stress, and hindered the capacity of S. Enteritidis to survive inside macrophages and to colonize extraintestinal organs, including the gallbladder. Altogether, our observations indicate that PGA is an antivirulence factor whose loss may have been a necessary event during Salmonella speciation to permit survival inside the host...|$|R

Furthermore, by measuring phosphodiesterase enzyme activity in extracts from cells containing the pdeA pdeB double mutant, we demonstrate that no additional phosphodiesterases are present in B. burgdorferi. pdeB single mutant cells exhibit significantly increased flexing, indicating a role for c-di-GMP in motility.

High concentrations of this nucleotide prevent swarming and promote adhesiveness. Further, we demonstrate that ScrC has intrinsic diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities, and these activities are controlled by ScrAB. Specifically, ScrC acts to form c-di-GMP in the absence of ScrA and ScrB; whereas ScrC acts to degrade c-di-GMP in the presence of ScrA and ScrB.

Although structures of single-domain BLUF proteins have been determined, none are available for a BLUF protein containing a functional output domain; the mechanism of light activation in this new class of photoreceptors has thus remained poorly understood. Here we report the biochemical, structural and mechanistic characterization of a full-length, active photoreceptor, BlrP 1 (also known as KPN_ 01598), from Klebsiella pneumoniae. BlrP 1 consists of a BLUF sensor domain and a phosphodiesterase EAL output domain which hydrolyses <b>cyclic</b> dimeric <b>GMP</b> (c-di-GMP).

The postendotoxin serum was not directly cytotoxic to TA 3 -Ha tumor cells in vitro, nor did it contain significant amounts of residual endotoxin, but it was rich in colony-stimulating factors (CSFs). High-titer CSF serum could be induced by endotoxic lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Nonendotoxic, lipid-free, and polysaccharide-rich hydrolytic breakdown product of LPS (called PS) was less potent but still active in CSF induction. There was a correlation between the level of CSF stimulation and the capacity of the sera to transfer tumor resistance (TUR). Those LPS preparations that had the highest CSF-inducing capacity were the most potent in TUR enhancement. Suppression of CSF production by treatment with theophylline or epinephrine, enhancers of <b>cyclic</b> AMP/cyclic <b>GMP</b> ratios, lowered the enhancement of TUR by endotoxic LPS.

To identify AI-regulated target genes in Vibrio cholerae El Tor (V. choleraeEl), the strain responsible for the current cholera pandemic, luciferase expression was assayed in an AI− strain carrying a random lux transcriptional reporter library in the presence and absence of exogenously added AIs. Twenty-three genes were identified and shown to require the QS transcription factor, HapR, for their regulation. Several of the QS-dependent target genes, annotated as encoding hypothetical proteins, in fact encode HD-GYP proteins, phosphodiesterases that degrade the intracellular second messenger <b>cyclic</b> dimeric <b>GMP</b> (c-di-GMP), which is important for controlling biofilm formation. Indeed, overexpression of a representative QS-activated HD-GYP protein in V. choleraeEl reduced the intracellular concentration of c-di-GMP, which in turn decreased exopolysaccharide production and biofilm formation. The V. cholerae classical biotype (V. choleraeCl), which caused previous cholera pandemics and is HapR−, controls c-di-GMP levels and biofilm formation by the VieA signaling pathway. We show that the VieA pathway is dispensable for biofilm formation in V. choleraeEl but that restoring HapR in V. choleraeCl reestablishes QS-dependent repression of exopolysaccharide production.
