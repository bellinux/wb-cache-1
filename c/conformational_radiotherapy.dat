40|$|BACKGROUND: The authors {{present their}} current {{attitude}} towards management of craniopharyngiomas in children. Radical surgery cannot be performed {{when one is}} not sure about its potential danger to the visual pathways and the hypothalamus. METHODS: Most of the surgeries that have been performed in our institution via an intracranial approach were incomplete and followed by radiotherapy, in the last 10 years with stereotactic <b>conformational</b> <b>radiotherapy.</b> DISCUSSION: Considering our past and present experience concerning the transphenoidal approach for treatment of craniopharyngiomas, we make a plea for the consideration of this approach in children whenever feasible (around 25 % of the cases in children older than 5 years). Craniopharyngiomas that can be removed by this approach represent a milder form {{of the disease and}} the results concerning the visual, hypothalamic functions and quality of life are significantly better than that obtained via an intracranial approach. When the craniopharyngioma cannot be removed by this approach because of tight hypothalamic adherences, the technique of cystosphenoidostomy with a custom-made shunt plus adjuvant stereotactic <b>conformational</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> is an alternative for its total removal...|$|E

On the basis of our previous cases, in the latter five of this series, the following therapeutic protocol was adopted. In those cases in which total removal was achieved, no further treatment was given if the MIB- 1 index was 4 %, a course of <b>conformational</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> was delivered. In subtotally removed cases, radiosurgery with linac was also performed (median dose 20 Gy) as well as <b>conformational</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> whenever there was a recurrence of the lesion (median dose 45 Gy). In cases in which there was only partial cytoreduction, <b>conformational</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> was administered with the adjunct of polychemotherapy if the MIB- 1 was > 4 %. Twenty patients were surgically treated: 11 men and nine women, with an average age of 26 years (range 17 years to 42 years). Total, subtotal and partial removals were achieved in, respectively, ten, three and seven cases. At average follow-up of 7 years, 16 patients had been cured, had significantly improved or were at least stable [Karnofsky performance status score (KPS) ] > 70 or more) ]. On the other hand, four patients had worsened; of these, two had died and two had a KPS= 50 and an unfavourable prognosis. The presence of histological atypia {{has proved to be a}} significantly negative risk factor for survival (P= 0. 02) while an MIB score > 4 % was significantly correlated with an unfavourable outcome (death or worsening of neurological status).

40|$|Background: <b>Conformational</b> {{thoracic}} <b>radiotherapy</b> (CTR) is a key-treatment in locally advanced nonsmall cell {{lung cancer}} (LA-NSCLC). Acute radiation pneumonitis (ARP) {{is one of}} the major complications. Aims: To evaluate the predictors of ARP after CTR in the treatment of LA-NSCLC. Materials and methods: A total of 47 consecutive patients (pts) were treated with CTR for LA-NSCLC and retrospectively analyzed. The mean total dose of radiation therapy (RT) was 65 Gy, with respiratory gating (RG) in 19 cases. Induction and concomitant chemotherapy was performed in 33 pts (70 %) and 41 pts (87 %), respectively. Results: Eleven pts (23 %) had an ARP resulting in death for one pt. In univariate analysis, age, sex, pretherapeutic value of forced expiratory volume (FEV), not-gated radiotherapy and type of concomitant chemotherapy did not appear as contributing factors in contrast to the administration of induction gemcitabine (p = 0. 03). The occurrence of ARP was significantly associated with nontumor lung volumes irradiated to 13 Gy (V 13, p = 0. 04), 20 Gy (V 20, p = 0. 02), and 25 Gy (V 25, p = 0. 006), the mean lung dose (p = 0. 008) and lung normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) (p = 0. 004). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the occurrence of ARP was significantly associated with age > 75 years (odds ratio (OR) = 16. 72, confidence interval (CI) 95 % 1. 77 - 157. 87) and administration of induction gemcitabine (OR = 18. 08, CI 95 % 1. 09 - 300. 08). Conclusion: ARP is a common acute complication, requiring close posttreatment follow-up, particularly for elderly patients. The use of gemcitabine before radiation should be avoided. The benefits and risks of CTR must be carefully analyzed, according to the dosimetric parameters...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAmong {{the current}} {{innovations}} to treat radioresistant tumors, improvement of radiotherapy relies {{on either the}} delivery of a higher dose of radiation to the target volume by focused beams (3 D <b>conformational</b> or intensity-modulated <b>radiotherapy,</b> hadrontherapy with protons or carbon ions…) while limiting their delivery to critical normal structures or {{the increase in the}} local effect of a given dose of radiation by radiosensitizing agents (metallic nanoparticles…). This presentation will summarize our current results with carbon ions and AGuIX® nanoparticles in different tumor models. We demonstrated the superior relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of carbon ions at different levels:- Gene and chromosomal damage induced by carbon irradiation are so complex that they cannot be transmitted in the progeny of irradiated tumor cells, thus limiting genomic instability and improving local control. Chromosome/chromatid loss appears as a specific signature of carbon ion exposure in sensitive and resistant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells (Hanot et al. Plos One, 2012). Furthermore, the response to carbon ions is independent of the telomeres’ size. The presence of long telomeres in tumor cells of patients with glioblastoma is a well-known factor of poor prognosis as they become more resistant to oxidative stress induced by conventional radiotherapy. Thus, our data first underlines that patients with long telomeres can advantageously benefit from carbon-therapy (Ferrandon et al., Mol Neurobiol, 2013). - Cell death is triggered earlier and more significantly by carbon ions in HNSCC or glioblastoma cellular models. It involves either early apoptosis in radiosensitive cells or mitotic catastrophe followed by late apoptosis in radioresistant ones. Apoptosis is activated through a pathway independent of p 53, but dependent on ceramide (a lipid signaling mediator) (Alphonse et al, BMC Cancer, 2013; Ferrandon et al., Cancer Letters, 2015), giving carbon ions a significant advantage since 50 % of tumors have a mutated p 53 gene. - Carbon ions are more effective than photons in killing cancer stem cells (CSCs) in HNSCC (Bertrand et al., Stem Cell Rev, 2014). Furthermore, molecular connections between the stem-cell state and epithelio-mesenchymal transition program have recently emerged, pointing out a double danger for cancer patients since CSCs have the ability to renew indefinitely and are resistant to apoptosis. Our investigations point out a significant decrease in the migration and invasion of both parental and CSC populations irradiated with carbon ions, thus highlighting the great interest of carbontherapy in the prevention of recurrences and metastases (Moncharmont et al., Oncotarget 2016). Hypoxia seems to have {{a key role in the}} self-renewal of CSCs (located in hypoxic niches), their stemness maintain, tumor angiogenesis, growth tumor and therapeutic resistance. The protein HIF- 1 α (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 α) is considered as the major transcriptional regulator of the cellular and developmental response to oxygen homeostasis. In hypoxic conditions, HIF- 1 α plays a central role in radioresistance (OER> 1. 2) and the increased invasion and migration phenomenon activated by a photonic irradiation. Conversely, since carbon ions appear unable to stabilize HIF- 1 α in CSCs, there is neither resistance linked to the oxygen effect (OER = 1) nor activation of the migration and invasion pathways (Wozny et al., Br J Cancer, 2017). AGuIX® (Activation and Guidance by Irradiation X) is a non-toxic gadolinium-based nanoparticle (GBNs) developed by the Lyon University. It accumulates in the tumor through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and clears rapidly through the kidneys due to its small size (sub- 5 nm). We performed a proof of concept on HNSCC, metastatic melanoma and chondrosarcoma tumors, known for their low survival rates, demonstrating the radiosensitizing efficacy of the AGuIX® nanoparticles in cellular (2 D and 3 D cultures) and preclinical models. GBNs enter HNSCC cells by passive diffusion and macropinocytosis (Rima et al, 2013), localize in cytoplasm, as free particle or entrapped in lysosomes, in close vicinity to mitochondria. GBNs combined with irradiation can produce a large variety of secondary emissions, such as secondary Auger and Compton electrons, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species that trigger an intra‐mitochondrial stress (ROS production, transmembrane potential decrease, mtDNA deletion) and nuclear DNA damage leading to cell death. The RBE in cancer cells is quite comparable to that observed in response to carbon ions, suggesting the existence of common mechanisms through the amplification of the local dose (Miladi et al., Nanomedicine 2015). The radioenhancing effect of AGuIX® was also observed when combined to carbon ion irradiation (Wozny et al., in revision). The efficacy of AGuIX® has also been demonstrated in orthotopic xenograft models of HNSCC and metastatic melanoma (Miladi et al., 2015; Kotb et al., Theranostics 2016); the experiments are ongoing for chondrosarcoma. Regulatory toxicity studies were conducted in rats and monkeys and a first human clinical study is ongoing in patients with multiple brain metastases (clinicaltrial. gov) ...|$|R

40|$|Surgery for jugular paraganglioma (PGL) tumors {{often results}} in the {{acquisition}} of neurological deficits where none had been present previously. This has {{a significant impact on}} the quality of life. Radiotherapy is a recognized alternative therapy. The aim of this study was to compare the results of radiotherapy and surgery for the management of jugular PGL in terms of function and tumor control to define a treatment algorithm. We conducted a retrospective and comparative analysis of the treatment of 41 patients by conventional radiotherapy and 47 patients by surgery via tertiary referral at an academic medical center. Forty-seven patients with type C and/or D jugular PGLs (mean age, 46 years) underwent surgery after endovascular embolization between 1984 and 1998 using an infratemporal fossa type A approach. The facial nerve was transposed in 18 patients. An adjunctive neurosurgical procedure was required in 14 patients. Mean follow-up was 66 months (range, 17 months to 14 years). Forty-one patients with type C jugular PGLs (mean age, 59. 5 years) were treated by external beam or <b>conformational</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> between 1988 and 2003 with a total mean dose of 45 Gy (range, 44 to 50 Gy). Mean follow-up was 50 months (range, 18 months to 13 years). The primary outcome measures were tumor control and cranial nerve status. Surgical resection, total or subtotal, yielded an overall 86 % rate of either cure or tumor stabilization. Radiotherapy achieved local control in 96 % of patients. For surgery, the main postoperative complications were dysphagia, aspiration, and facial paralysis. Patients treated by radiotherapy developed minor disabilities. We concluded that radiotherapy and surgery achieve similar oncologic outcomes, but the former achieves tumor control with less morbidity. Our data favor radiotherapy as treatment for jugular PGLs, but we acknowledge that the aims of these two treatment modalities are different, namely, eradication of tumor by surgery versus stabilization of tumor with radiotherapy. The search for the better quality of life has to be weighed against the uncertainty of the long-term behavior of the tumor...|$|E
40|$|The {{first chapter}} of the {{theoretical}} part of my bachelor's thesis {{is focused on the}} theme of radiotherapy in general as well as to its history. Radiotherapy is a young medical field which treats both malignant and non-malignant diseases by ionizing radiation. The roots of this discipline go {{back to the beginning of}} the 20 th century, when German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen discovered X-rays. These rays started to be used in the treatment of tumorous diseases; the first case of tumour elimination by these rays was described in 1896. The second theoretical chapter outlines the types of radiotherapy and their clinical applications. The first type of radiotherapy is curative (radical), which is the primary choice for treatment of tumours, with the aim to eradicate the tumour completely and cure the patient. Another type of radiotherapy is adjuvant. This is a "securing" method, indicated in case of assumption that there are still microscopic tumour remains in the patient's body. There is also neoadjuvant radiotherapy, so-called preoperative. It is applied before the medical procedure when it is necessary to reduce the size of the tumour. Another clinically applied type is radiotherapy with palliative intent. This treatment is indicated to patients whose disease is incurable and serve to remove or alleviate the symptoms. The last type is non-tumorous radiotherapy. This method of treatment is used for non-tumorous diseases and it is always the method of the last resort. The following chapter discusses the theme of radiotherapeutic irradiator. These devices include simulator which simulates the irradiation plan and is very important for planning and control in radiotherapy. Linear accelerators are the most often tools used for irradiation. These accelerators use high-frequency beam of photons or electrons for irradiation. Other devices used in radiotherapy include cobalt and cesium irradiators. The fourth chapter deals with planning in radiotherapy. Irradiation plan, which must be approved by a doctor, is put together in the process of planning. This plan is approved in case when the created combination of irradiation fields achieves the most accurate covering of the target volume by a required dose, and at the same time healthy tissues and organs are spared as much as possible. This chapter also mentions the theme of phantoms that are very important for planning in radiotherapy. Phantoms were also used during the measurement within the practical part of the thesis. The fifth chapter is devoted to irradiation techniques used in radiotherapy. All basic techniques used for irradiation are described here one-field irradiation technique, which is the simplest one, two-field irradiation, i. e. contralateral, convergent or tangential techniques. Also three-field irradiation technique the T and Y techniques, as well as the four-field technique BOX and Crossfire techniques. The most complex techniques include five and more fields where three-dimensional <b>conformational</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> is used. The last chapter describes individual planning systems used at the Department of Oncology of České Budějovice Hospital, with which the objectives of the practical part of the bachelor's thesis were achieved. These planning systems include Mephysto mc 2, Diamond and Eclipse programs. Independent measurements were carried out within the practical part of the bachelor's thesis, on the basis of which the following hypothesis was confirmed: "A procedure implemented in compliance with methodology No. 4 can shorten the time of measuring of parameters of ionizing radiation beams from linear accelerator to be entered into the DIAMOND computing system. " The aim of the thesis was to get data files for entering the source of ionizing radiation (linear accelerator) into the DIAMOND computing system.

40|$|Objetivo: Este estudo objetivou avaliar a {{xerostomia}} por meio de questionário e objetivamente analisou-se o volume das glândulas salivares maiores pela TC e a função e excreção por meio de cintilografia, antes e após a radioterapia. Materiais e Métodos: Neste estudo prospectivo foram selecionados 28 pacientes, 22 homens e 6 mulheres, com idade que variou entre 18 e 75 anos, com diagnóstico histopatológico de carcinoma espinocelular na região de cabeça e pescoço. Os pacientes foram examinados clínica e radiograficamente para verificar as condições bucais antes da radioterapia. Todos receberam atendimento odontológico. Para avaliar subjetivamente a xerostomia utilizou-se um questionário, a TC para avaliar o volume das glândulas salivares maiores e a cintilografia para análise da função e excreção, antes e após a radioterapia. Resultados: Da aplicação do questionário de xerostomia: foi possível verificar que os respondentes do questionário de xerostomia apresentaram tendência à elevação de seus escores de qualidade de vida ao final do tratamento, quando comparados ao início do tratamento. A elevação dos escores indica a alteração da qualidade de vida, considerada inicialmente como regular passando para ruim ao final do tratamento. Sobre a questão relativa ao gradiente de secura, verificou-se que inicialmente os pacientes classificavam como muito confortável e passaram a sentir, ao final do tratamento, um gradiente de secura moderado. Por fim, em relação ao RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group), verificou-se a alteração significativa dos gradientes dos pacientes. Foi possível analisar que inicialmente os pacientes classificaram-se sem alterações, e ao final do tratamento, passaram a classificação para grau II tendendo a grau III. Os exames tomográficos revelaram que ao avaliar as dimensões das glândulas salivares por meio de tomografia, foi possível verificar que, em comparação ao período inicial, houve redução significativa do volume médio das glândulas parótidas e submandibulares (exceto as esquerdas) após o término do tratamento radioterápico. Em relação à função e excreção (exames cintilográficos) : ao avaliar a função das glândulas parótidas direita e esquerda foi possível verificar que houve elevação significativa dos escores. Já nas glândulas submandibulares direitas verificou-se que estas passaram de função normal, observada no início do tratamento, para uma disfunção leve. Um comportamento semelhante fora observado nas glândulas submandibulares esquerdas, porém apenas uma tendência à significância estatística. Em relação à excreção, verificou-se que houve uma redução das glândulas, sendo que apenas a glândula submandibular esquerda apresentou redução estatisticamente significativa de sua excreção. Conclusão: Os pacientes apresentaram alterações estatisticamente significativas nas glândulas salivares maiores após a radioterapia conformacional nas três modalidades de análise. Pela facilidade de aplicação do questionário esse estudo propõe como protocolo de atenção ao paciente submetido à radioterapia, no contexto do acompanhamento multidisciplinar antes, durante e depois da radioterapia. _______________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTObjectives: This {{study has}} the aim to evaluate xerostomia, {{by means of}} a questionnaire and to objectively analyze the volume of major salivary glands by CT (computerized tomography), and the function and excretion by means of scintigraphy before and after radiotherapy. Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, 28 patients between 18 and 75 years old were selected: 22 men and 6 women, with a histopathologic diagnosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The patients were clinically and radiographically examined to verify mouth conditions before radiotherapy. All patients received dental treatment. A quantitative analysis of salivary flow was made as well as a subjective analysis of xerostomia, using questionnaires. The CT was used to evaluate the volume of the major salivary glands and the scintigraphy for the analysis of function and excretion before and after radiotherapy. Results: From the xerostomia questionnaire, it was possible to verify that those who answered it showed a tendency of a significant raise of their scores on life quality in the treatment end when compared to the treatment start. The score raise shows the change of life quality, which was initially considered as regular and was bad in the treatment end. In relation to the mouth dryness gradient question, it was verified that, initially, the patients classified it as very comfortable and after as a moderate mouth dryness gradient in the treatment end. Finally, in relation to the RTOG (radiation toxicity group), a significant change was verified in patients’ gradient. It was possible to analyze that, initially, the patients classified themselves as having no changes, and in the end of treatment, they changed their classification to level II, tending to III. The tomographic exams revealed: when evaluating the salivary glands dimensions by means of tomography, it was possible to verify that, in comparison to the initial period, there was a significant reduction of the averages of parotid and submandibular glands (except the left one) after the end of radiotherapy treatment. In relation to function and excretion (scintigraphic exams) : when evaluating the function of right and left parotid glands, it was possible to verify that there was a significant score rise. However, in relation to the right submandibular glands, it was verified that these ones changed from normal function, as observed in the treatment start, to light dysfunction. A similar behavior has been observed in the left submandibular glands, although only a tendency to significant statistics was noticed. In relation to excretion, it was verified that there was a tendency to a reduction by the glands, being the left submandibular gland the only one to show that there was a statistically significant reduction of its excretion. Conclusion: The patients showed changes that were statistically significant in major salivary glands after <b>conformational</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> in the three kinds of analysis. Due {{to the fact that it}} was easy to apply the questionnaire, this study proposes this questionnaire as a protocol of patient attention to those subjected to the radiotherapy, in the context of multidisciplinary follow-up before, during and after radiotherapy...|$|E
