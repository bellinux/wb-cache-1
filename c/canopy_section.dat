Also, because of the engine's enlarged crankcase and the oil return lines which ran in front of it, these G-10s had small blister fairings incorporated into the lower engine cowlings, forward of and below the exhaust stacks. The radio antenna mast was also removed from atop the rear fuselage turtledeck, and replaced with {{what appears to be the}} swept-back antenna from the Me 163B Komet rocket fighter, but oriented in reverse from the rocket fighter's mount, in being swept forward instead from its port wing leading edge underside mount on the G-10 subtype.|$|E

The maximum number of occupants is two. If the sailplane is to be flown solo, the pilot must be {{sitting in the front}} seat and his weight (including parachute and ballast) must be at least 70 kg (154 lb). If the pilot's weight is less than 70 kg (154 lb), it is necessary to use ballast to bring the total weight in the front to at least 70 kg (154 lb). A weighted cushion weighing 15 kg (33 lb) is available to replace the soft seat cushion bottom in the front seat. Additional ballast may need to be added to bring the total to at least 70 kg (154 lb).|$|E
5000|$|Referred {{to as the}} [...] "bastard {{aircraft}} of the Erla factory" [...] in the Luftwaffes Aircraft Variants Book of December 1944, the G-10 was a Bf 109 G airframe {{combined with}} the new DB 605 D-2 engine, created to maintain production levels with minimal disruption of the assembly lines until production of K-series airframes would reach sufficient levels. Despite what the designation would suggest, it appeared in service after the G-14 in November 1944, largely replacing previous G-series aircraft on the production lines of Erla, WNF and Messerschmitt Regensburg factories. Contrary to popular belief the G-10 were not rebuilt older airframes but new production.

It had a two-seat cabin (front: instructor, rear: student) with a common closed <b>canopy</b> (front <b>section</b> opening to the right, rear section sliding). Landing gear was conventional (Junak 2) or tricycle (Junak 3) and fixed. A 5-cylinder M-11FR radial engine gave 119 kW (160 hp) of maximum power and 104 kW (140 hp) normal power. The cylinders have individual cowls, which were often removed. The {{aircraft was}} fitted with a two-blade fixed pitch wooden propeller. It carried 80 liters (Junak 2) or 100 liters (Junak 3) of fuel. The plane had no armament. The Junak 3 was fitted with a radio.|$|R
40|$|Ground-based {{proximal}} sensing of vineyard features {{is gaining}} interest {{due to its}} ability to serve in even quite small plots with {{the advantage of being}} conducted concurrently with normal vineyard practices (i. e., spraying, pruning or soil tilling) with no dependence upon weather conditions, external services or law-imposed limitations. The purpose of the present work was to test performance of the new terrestrial multi-sensor MECS-VINEÂ® in terms of reliability and degree of correlation with several canopy growth and yield parameters in the grapevine. MECS-VINEÂ®, once conveniently positioned in front of the tractor, can provide simultaneous assessment of growth features and microclimate of specific <b>canopy</b> <b>sections</b> of the two adjacent row sides. MECS-VINEÂ® integrates a series of microclimate sensors (air relative humidity, air and surface temperature) with two (left and right) matrix-based optical RGB imaging sensors and a related algorithm, termed Canoyct). MECS-VINEÂ® was run five times along the season in a mature cv. Barbera vineyard and a Canopy Index (CI, pure number varying from 0 to 1000), calculated through its built-in algorithm, validated vs. canopy structure parameters (i. e., leaf layer number, fractions of canopy gaps and interior leaves) derived from point quadrat analysis. Results showed that CI was highly correlated vs. any canopy parameter at any date, although the closest relationships were found for CI vs. fraction of canopy gaps (R 2 = 0. 97) and leaf layer number (R 2 = 0. 97) for data pooled over 24 test vines. While correlations against canopy light interception and total lateral leaf area were still unsatisfactory, a good correlation was found vs. cluster and berry weight (R 2 = 0. 76 and 0. 71, respectively) suggesting a good potential also for yield estimates. Besides the quite satisfactory calibration provided, main improvements of MECS-VINEÂ® usage versus other current equipment are: (i) MECS-VINEÂ® delivers a segmented evaluation of the canopy up to 15 different sectors, therefore allowing to differentiate canopy structure and density at specific and crucial canopy segments (i. e., basal part where clusters are located) and (ii) the sensor is optimized to work at any time of the day with any weather condition without the need of any supplemental lighting system...|$|R

40|$|From 2002 to 2006, adult avocado trees, Persea {{americana}} Miller cv. Hass, {{located in}} the subtropical-fruit-producing area of Andalucia (southern Spain) developed symptoms of dieback characterized by death of twigs and branches in the tree <b>canopy.</b> <b>Sections</b> of surface-disinfested, necrotic branch tissues were plated on Difco potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Sparks, NV) and a Neofusicoccum-like fungus was isolated. On PDA, the isolates had white, appressed mycelium that turned dull gray as the colony aged, although conidia were not formed. Abundant pycnidia and conidia developed when isolates were cultured on 2 % water agar with sterilized pine needles as substratum at 25 Â°C under near-UV light for 2 weeks. Conidia were hyaline, unicellular, ellipsoid with an obtuse apex and subtruncate base, averaged 16. 2 Â¿m long by 5. 8 Â¿m wide and ranged from 12. 0 to 20. 0 by 4. 0 to 8. 0 Â¿m, and becoming brown {{with one or two}} septa with age. Sequenced rDNA fragments (ITS 1, 5. 8 S rDNA, and ITS 2, amplified with ITS 1 and ITS 4 primers) of two avocado isolates were 100 % homologous with Neofusicoccum parvum (Pennycook & Samuels) Crous, Slippers, & A. J. L. Phillips (1) (GenBank Accession Nos. AM 410965 and AM 410966). Morphological and molecular results confirmed this species as N. parvum, reported as the anamorph of Botryosphaeria parva (1). A pathogenicity test was conducted using two isolates on sets of five 2 -year-old avocado plants produced from seeds of cv. Topa-Topa growing in 5 -liter pots with soil. Unwounded and wounded plants were used for inoculations. Plants were wounded 2 to 3 cm below the apical tip with a lance (4 mm long and 1 mm deep). For inoculation, 4 -mm 2 -week-old PDA culture plugs were placed in contact with wounded tissues and covered with Parafilm. Five noninoculated plants treated similarly served as controls. Plants were maintained in the greenhouse with a temperature range of 18 to 26 Â°C, and 1 month later, brown stem lesions, as much as 5 cm, originating from the inoculation site followed by dieback of branches were observed. Reisolations from necrotic branches were successful, and both isolates with identical morphology to those used for inoculations were recovered. Pathogenicity tests of seedlings using the same methods also caused stem lesions on unwounded plants and the pathogen was reisolated. To our knowledge, this is the first report of N. parvum causing dieback of avocado trees in Spain. Previously, B. parva has been reported causing stem-end rot of avocado fruit in New Zealand (2). In Spain, since diseased orchards are increasing rapidly, this pathogen could be efficiently distributed by pruning activities (tools and vegetal debris) as observed with other diseases (3). The presence of N. parvum in this subtropical area presents a serious disease problem not only to avocado but also to mango (Mangifera indica L.), which is another susceptible host (4).

40|$|Super {{high density}} (SHD) olive has been {{introduced}} in Italy, mainly in the southern regions (flat areas of Apulia and Sicily), {{in the middle of}} 2000 s, using only three cultivars of low vigour: 'Arbequina', 'Arbosana' and 'Koroneiki'. Since the limited cultivar choice is still considered one of the main issue for SHD in central Italy, a comparative trial was set up in 2006 to evaluate the suitability of 4 Italian olive cultivars to a planting density of 1667 treesha- 1. Vegetative vigour, productivity and oil quality were evaluated for four local cultivars ('Frantoio', 'Leccino', 'Maurino' and 'Moraiolo') in comparison with the standard 'Arbequina'in a SHD orchard. 'Frantoio' and 'Leccino' were more vigorous than 'Arbequina' and 'Maurino'; the most precocious were 'Arbequina' and 'Maurino', and the most delayed 'Frantoio'. After 8 years form plantation, 'Arbequina' and 'Maurino' provided significantly higher accumulated yield when compared to 'Leccino'. Considering all the vegetative tree characteristics (<b>canopy</b> volume, trunk <b>section</b> area and removed wood by pruning) the most vigorous cultivars were 'Frantoio' and 'Leccino'. The crop efficiency of 'Maurino' was similar to that of 'Arbequina' and higher than those of the other 3 Italian cultivars. Concerning the oil quality, the highest phenols content was recorded in 'Frantoio' and 'Leccino' oil; the lowest in 'Arbequina' oil. On the contrary 'Frantoio', 'Leccino' and 'Moraiolo' had the highest oleic acid contents while 'Arbequina' and 'Maurino' had similar values. Polyunsaturated fatty acid content was significantly higher in olive oil from 'Maurino'. To conclude we can say that 'Maurino', showing low vegetative vigour and compact growth, early and high yield, adaptation to mechanization, good oil quality and shelf life, resulted to be the most suitable cultivar for SHD system in this trial...|$|R
5000|$|The {{use of a}} nose-mount annular {{radiator}} for the forward engine (much like a Jumo 211-powered Ju 88, or Jumo 213-powered Focke-Wulf Fw 190D-9) and a ventral-fuselage mount airscooped radiator installation for cooling the rear engine (appearing like that on a P-51 Mustang) was distinctive. When fitted with DB 603A engines delivering 1,750 PS (1,287 kW, 1,726 hp) at takeoff it {{had a pair of}} the largest displacement (at 44.52 litres) inverted V12 aircraft engine design mass-produced during the Third Reich's existence. The Do 335 V1 first prototype, bearing the Stammkennzeichen (factory radio code) of CP+UA, flew on 26 October 1943 under the control of FlugkapitÃ¤n Hans Dieterle, a regular Heinkel test pilot and later primary Dornier test pilot. However, several problems during the initial flight of the Do 335 would continue to plague the aircraft through most of its short history. Issues were found with the weak landing gear and with the maingear's wheel well doors, resulting in them being removed {{for the remainder of the}} V1's test flights. The Do 335 V1 made 27 flights, flown by three different pilots. During these test flights the V2 (W.Nr 230002), Stammkennzeichen CP+UB was completed and made its first flight on 31 December 1943, again under the control of Dieterle. New to the V2 were upgraded DB 603A-2 engines, and several refinements learned from the test flights of the V1 as well as further windtunnel testing. On 20 January 1944, the Do 335 V3 (W.Nr. 230004), Stammkennzeichen CP+UC was completed and flown for its first time by Werner Altrogge. The V3 was powered by the new pre-production DB 603G-0 engines which could produce [...] at take-off and featured a slightly redesigned canopy which included twin rear-view mirrors in blisters, one in each of two matching side panels of the well-framed, eleven-panel main <b>canopy's</b> openable <b>section.</b> Following the flights of the V3, in mid January 1944, RLM ordered five more prototypes (V21-V25), to be built as night fighters. By this time, more than 60 hours of flight time had been put on the Do 335 and reports showed it to be a good handling, but more importantly, very fast aircraft, described by Generalfeldmarschall Erhard Milch himself as [...] "...holding its own in speed and altitude with the P-38 and it does not suffer from engine reliability issues". Thus the Do 335 was scheduled to begin mass construction, with the initial order of 120 preproduction aircraft to be manufactured by DWF (Dornier-Werke Friedrichshafen) to be completed no later than March 1946. This number included a number of bombers, destroyers (heavy fighters), and several yet to be developed variants. At the same time, DWM (Dornier-Werke MÃ¼nchen) was scheduled to build over 2000 Do 335s in various models, due for delivery in March 1946 as well.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScConsEcol(Conservation Ecology and Entomology) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Riparian {{areas are}} highly complex systems with {{varying levels of}} {{disturbance}} that are highly susceptible to invasion by alien plants. Once invaded, riparian areas {{play a major role}} in the dispersal and spread of invasive alien plants (IAPs) through the river system and, in some cases, to neighbouring landscapes. Riparian areas have therefore been prioritized by many alien clearing initiatives in South Africa. Current practice for the restoration of cleared areas is minimal and relies mainly on the un-aided recovery of native species from residual individuals and soil stored seed banks. Little research, however, has been done on the effectiveness of this approach or the extent to which riparian seed banks contribute towards community restoration. This study is part of a national research initiative (Targets for Ecosystem Repair in Riparian Ecosystems in Fynbos, Grassland and Savanna Biomes) funded by Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, in collaboration with Working for Water, The Centre for Invasion Biology and the Universities of Cape Town, Stellenbosch, Rhodes and Witwatersrand. The initiative undertook to investigate different restoration techniques on various invaded sites for their cost-effectiveness, efficiency, practicality and conservation integrity. This study has three aims. The first is to determine the composition of seed banks in un-invaded riparian areas within the fynbos biome to be used as a benchmark for future research, restoration grading and other management requirements. The second aim is to determine the composition of seed banks in heavily invaded riparian areas, and thus to assess the impact of invasion on the integrity of the seed banks. The third aim is to evaluate the restoration potential of riparian seed banks following the clearing of invasive alien plants (IAPs). Study sites were selected within four river systems in the south-western part of the Western Cape Province in South Africa: the Berg, Eerste, Molenaars and Wit Rivers. Plots were selected in both invaded (> 75 % IAP canopy cover; considered âclosedâ alien stands) and un-invaded (also termed reference, with < 25 % IAP <b>canopy</b> cover) <b>sections</b> of the river. Replicate plots were established along varying gradients of elevation (mountain stream and foothill) and moisture regimes (dry, wet and transitional bank zones). Soil samples were collected together with above-ground vegetation surveys and comparisons were made. Results from this study confirm those of previous studies that seed banks offer little reference to current aboveground vegetation, but rather offer insight into past vegetation history as well as future vegetation assemblages. Worldwide, many of the species that characteristically form seed banks are early successional species. A community study was done for the seed bank based on the species that germinated and were identifiable at termination of the project (6 months after initiation). Three clusters of species could be identified. One group comprised 32 generalist species that occurred in both reference and invaded sections of the rivers. A second group comprised 39 species associated with invaded sites, and a third group of 40 species that was associated with reference sites. A few sub-community groups were found within both the âreferenceâ and âinvadedâ community groups which were assumed to be habitat specific. Most species were âpioneerâ or relatively-short lived, early-successional species which play a vital role in the initial post-disturbance vegetation cover, and facilitate establishment of later successional species. Seed banks are notoriously variable over space and time, and floristic representation is often biased as a result of differences among species in seed production, dispersal and longevity in the soil. The general consensus is that seeds have an irregular, clustered spatial distribution that is dictated by both biological and environmental factors. Within river systems, the irregular clustering can be exceptionally skewed with the influence of pockets of high sediment deposition along the bank. Environmental factors that were found to significantly skew germination results were the presence of fire, as well as the extent and intensity of invasion (duration and cover). The high level of diversity and abundance in reference Berg River mountain stream seed banks was perceived to be a direct result of a moderate fire frequency (between 8 - 15 years) and the relatively natural state of the vegetation (i. e. very little invasion). Also, diversity and richness of indigenous species from the Wit and Molenaars Rivers were substantially higher in the invaded samples than the reference samples, probably because both river systems have a long history of invasion and other anthropogenic disturbances which would have an effect on the samples from âreferenceâ sections (i. e. even a 25 % presence of IAPs seems adequate enough to alter the composition of the seed bank). Correspondence analyses showed that species had clear affinities towards different levels of âkeyâ riparian environmental variables (fire, invasion and anthropogenic disturbance). Most species were associated with moderate levels of fire frequency, invasion history, and anthropogenic disturbance. Comparisons of seed bank species assemblages between the lateral and longitudinal variables of the rivers offered insights into the habitat requirements of certain fynbos and riparian species. Most significant were the results from bank zone comparisons which showed distinct species groupings along the different moisture bands. As could be expected, riparian species were best represented within the wet bank zones and fynbos species within the dry bank zone, while species characteristic of both zones occurred in the transitional zone, making this seed bank zone the richest in species. Mountain stream sections were richer and more diverse than foothill sections over both invaded and reference samples. This is hypothesised to be linked to lower levels of anthropogenic disturbance experienced in the mountain stream sections. The impact of invasion on the riparian seed bank was most clearly shown through the correspondence analyses for the 20 most frequently occurring species. The seed bank assembly patterns were clearly defined by the state of the river (reference or invaded). Interestingly, this pattern was evident at all three spatial scales; landscape (rivers), reach (mountain stream and foothill sections) and habitat (dry, wet and transitional zones). The reference seed bank assemblage was more tightly grouped, implying that the species were more closely associated with each other and less variable than those of the invaded seed bank assemblages. The species groupings within the invaded seed banks were influenced by variables such as reach and zone, whereas the reference seed bank assemblages seem relatively unaffected by these variables. This implies that the presence of invasive alien plants creates additional variation within the seed bank which alters the natural groupings. At a broad scale, the invaded seed banks were less species rich. This means that not only will the resulting seedling community be harder to predict, but it will also have fewer species. However although generally lower in species richness, the seed banks from almost all invaded rivers interestingly showed a higher diversity of indigenous species than their reference counterparts. This is very promising in terms of rehabilitation of post-cleared riparian sites, but more information is needed to understand the seed bank composition and determine how sustainable the seed banks are for rehabilitation in the long-term. All invaded sections had fewer herbaceous perennial species but more herbaceous annual species. Graminoids made up 50 % or more of the seed bank regardless of state (reference or invaded), while woody species (shrubs/shrublets) were generally more prevalent in the reference samples. These results imply that following the removal of invasive alien plants, the vegetation to regenerate from the seed bank is likely to comprise of short-lived, herbaceous species that are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the indigenous riparian community. It is however important to note that this study investigated only the species that were able to germinate over the study period (6 month germination period). Many riparian species may not have been represented because they are either late germinators or may not be present in the soil seed bank at all. In order to gain a holistic understanding of riparian community recruitment, it is recommended that seed bank studies such as this one be included in a more broad scale, long term investigation which takes into account various reproductive strategies used by riparian species. Research of this nature is in its infancy worldwide and there are many challenges involved in measuring diversity and change in these systems. However, within the scope of this study, I suggest that these results shed light on previously unanswered and important questions regarding the ecology of seed banks in the riparian ecosystems of the Western Cape...|$|R
