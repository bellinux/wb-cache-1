40|$|We study {{under the}} linear {{approximation}} {{the stability of}} planar motions [...] a one parameter family of partial solutions of the equations describing the satellite attitude motion in a circular orbit. Keywords: attitude dynamics, stability of motion 1. Introduction When a satellite moves in the central gravity field, its attitude motion can be a planar motion, in which case one of the <b>principal</b> <b>central</b> <b>axes</b> of inertia is perpendicular to the orbital plane (Beletsky, 1975). If the satellite orbit is elliptical, such planar motions have rather complicated behavior (in particular, chaotic motions are possible). The situation is simplified for a circular orbit: the equation describing the discussed class of motions represents the mathematical pendulum equation in this case. Properties of the planar satellite motions in a circular orbit were investigated previously by Kane and Shippy (1963), Markeev and Sokolsky (1977) and other specialists. 2.

The {{problem of}} {{development}} of the microsatellite attitude control system {{on the base of}} reaction wheels positioned along its <b>principal</b> <b>central</b> <b>axes</b> of inertia is considered in this article. As difference from the classical mathematical models describing the microsatellite motion, this article includes the mathematical model of reaction wheel which is controlled by the input voltage of the electric motor. PD-controller is used {{as the basis for the}} {{development of the}} control law for microsatellite attitude. The stability analysis of the microsatellite attitude control process was carried out with the help of Lyapunov function method. This analysis allowed to prove that obtained attitude control law provides the asymptotic stability of the microsatellite rotational motion. Further, the function of control voltage for the reaction wheel’s electric motor with account of its technical specifications was obtained based on the derived mathematical model of the reaction wheel’s dynamics. The results of performed simulation showed the effectiveness of developed control. Obtained results of the study provide a base for the use of presented approach to the development of attitude control system for microsatellites with various missions...|$|R
40|$|Modeling of multi-dimensional ground {{motions for}} {{earthquake}} response analyses of 3 D structural systems {{require that the}} <b>principal</b> <b>axes</b> of ground motions be accurately determined. The Penzien-Watabe model is commonly used to define an orthogonal set of <b>principal</b> <b>axes</b> in which the major principal axis is correlated with the direction from the recording station to the earthquake epicenter and the minor principal axis is directed vertically.

40|$|Member, IEEE Abstract—Visual {{surveillance}} {{using multiple}} cameras has attracted increasing interest in recent years. Correspondence between multiple cameras {{is one of}} the most important and basic problems which visual surveillance using multiple cameras brings. In this paper, we propose a simple and robust method, based on <b>principal</b> <b>axes</b> of people, to match people across multiple cameras. The correspondence likelihood reflecting the similarity of pairs of <b>principal</b> <b>axes</b> of people is constructed according to the relationship between ”ground-points ” of people detected in each camera view and the intersections of <b>principal</b> <b>axes</b> detected in different camera views and transformed to the same view. Our method has the following desirable properties: 1) Camera calibration is not needed. 2) Accurate motion detection and segmentation are less critical due to the robustness of the principal axis-based feature to noise. 3) Based on the fused data derived from correspondence results, positions of people in each camera view can be accurately located even when the people are partially occluded in all views. The experimental results on several real video sequences from outdoor environments have demonstrated the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our method.
