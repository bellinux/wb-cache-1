40|$|Many {{industrial}} structures associated with railway infrastructures {{rely on a}} large number of bolted joint connections to ensure safe and reliable operation of the track and trackside furniture. Significant sums of money are spent annually to repair the damage caused by bolt failures and to maintain the integrity of bolted structures. In the U. K., Network Rail (the organization responsible for rail network maintenance and safety) conducts corrective and preventive maintenance manually on 26, 000 sets of points (each having approximately 30 bolted joints per set), in order to ensure operational success and safety for the travelling public. Such manual maintenance is costly, disruptive, unreliable and prone to human error. The aim of this work is to provide a means of automatically measuring the clamping force of each individual bolted joint, by means of an instrumented washer. This paper describes the development of a sensor means {{to be used in the}} washer, which satisfies the following criteria. 1. Sense changes in the clamping force of the joint and report this fact. 2. Provide compatibility with the large dynamic range of clamping force. 3. Satisfy the limitations in terms of physical size. 4. Provide the means to electronically interface with the washer. 5. Provide a means of powering the washer in situ. 6. Provide a solution at an acceptable cost. Specifically the paper focuses on requirements 1, 2 and 3 and presents the results that support further development of the proposed design and the realization of a pre-prototype system. In the paper, various options for the force sensing element (strain gage, capacitor, piezo-resistive) have been compared, using design optimization techniques. As a result of the evaluation, piezo-resistive sensors in concert with a proprietary force attenuation method, have been found to offer the best performance and cost trade-off The performance of the novel <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> has been evaluated experimentally and the results show that a smart washer can be developed to monitor the condition of bolted joints as found on railway track and points.

50|$|A <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> is a {{relatively}} expensive component in an EMB caliper. The cost is derived from its high unit value from a supplier, as well as marked production expenses because of its inclusion. The later emanates from the complex assembly procedures dealing with small tolerances, as well as on-line calibration for performance variability from one <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> to another. The successful use of a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> in an EMB system poses a challenging engineering task. If a clamp forcesensor is placed close to a brake pad, {{then it will be}} subjected to severe temperature conditions reaching up to 800 Celsius that will challenge its mechanical integrity. Also temperature drifts must be compensated for. This situation can be avoided by embedding a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> deep within the caliper. However, embedding this sensor leads to hysteresis that is influenced by friction between the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> and the point of contact of an inner pad with the rotor. This hysteresis prevents a true <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> to be measured. Due to the cost issues and engineering challenges involved with including the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> <b>sensor,</b> it might be desirable to eliminate this component from the EMB system. A potential opportunity to achieve this presents itself in accurate estimation of the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> based on alternative EMB system sensory measurements leading to the omission of a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the problem of}} estimating <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> in an electro-mechanical brake (EMB) for an automotive brake-by-wire (BBW) system. A <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> is typically used in EMB designs {{and the elimination of}} this component is strongly demanded due to implementation difficulties and cost issues. The motivation behind this thesis is to make developmental inroads into the deficiencies provided by previous attempts to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force.</b> Previous attempts have deficiencies for high speed braking applications as well as handling thermally dependent parameter variations. A dynamic stiffness model to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> is developed that relies on the actuator resolver sensor and two additional temperature sensors. Previous attempts to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> have been stiffness based and have not been capable of successfully modelling parameter variations in response to heating. This thesis introduces new developments on how to model stiffness parameter variations under the influence of heating. Two temperature sensors are required to be employed in this new approach. These additional sensors will not have a considerable impact towards the cost savings created by omitting a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> <b>sensor.</b> A torque balance model to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> is also developed that relies on the actuator resolver sensor and actuator motor current sensors. A training strategy is used for the dynamic stiffness and torque balance models to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> so that wear dependent parameters can be adapted. The two independent models to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> are fused using various sensor fusion algorithms to give improved estimates of <b>clamp</b> <b>force.</b> A maximum-likelihood estimator is used to optimize the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of estimation. This is followed by implementing a Kalman filter to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> in an EMB. The dynamic stiffness model is used as the state space equation in the Kalman filter, whilst the torque balance model is used to give measurement updates. Experimental verification showed that the Kalman filter was more accurate than the maximum-likelihood estimator as expected, however the Kalman filter required more computational burden. A RMSE of 0. 5 kN was attained for the Kalman filter and 0. 56 kN for the maximum-likelihood estimator...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} an electro-mechanical dual acting pulley {{continuously variable}} transmission (EMDAP CVT) system and presents a method of measuring belt-pulley <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> indirectly using a DC motor current sensor. The EMDAP CVT mainly consists of two movable primary (input) and secondary (output) pulley sheaves connected by metal pushing V-belt. Two DC motor’s actuation systems adjust the CVT ratio. Additionally, the secondary actuation system controls belt-pulley <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> by adjusting the flatness of the spring discs placed {{at the back of}} each secondary pulley sheave to keep the belt tight and prevent belt slip. Ideally, a <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> is used to measure the belt-pulley <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> however the use of <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> inside transmission gearbox is not feasible due to high temperature and oily environment. A viable solution for indirectly measuring the <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> using current <b>sensor</b> for DC motor is proposed. Since the DC motor actuates the movable pulleys to clamp the belt, the relationship between the DC motor current and belt-pulley <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> can then be investigated experimentally.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two {{practically}} important {{issues associated with}} the development of an electromechanical brake (EMB, Brake-by-wire) and its safety control in early design stage. ^ The first issue is the development of an analytical dynamic model which should have all relevant degrees of freedom without being unnecessarily complex so as to be useful in PC simulation environment. This objective is achieved through the analytical model development of all relevant hardware components of EMB and modal analysis of its linearized approximation for model reduction. This model fulfills the need arising due to the nonexistence of an analytical model for EMB. The developed model has six degrees of freedom (DOF) and includes essential nonlinearities such as gear backlashes, Coulomb frictions, and disk air gap clearance. ^ The second issue is concerned with the safety control of EMB, either in case of <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> failure or without using expensive <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> for cost-saving purposes. To establish a force feedback structure without using <b>force</b> <b>sensor,</b> two simplified models are developed for contacting phase and non-contacting phase respectively, and a novel model based edge detection method is proposed and evaluated. Various parameter estimations are then performed to find realistic ways to obtain accurate and reliable estimates of key system parameters on-line to deal with the large operating ranges and changing working conditions of EMB. In addition, to deal with various nonlinearities and uncertain system parameters associated with an EMB, an advanced indirect adaptive robust controller (IARC) incorporated with the air gap management is designed for the entire brake operation to ensure a robust control performance. Extensive simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the analytical model and the achievable control performance of the imbedded IARC design without <b>force</b> <b>sensor.</b> Simulation results reveal that, in terms of transient tracking performance for ABS cycling, the proposed IARC <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> controller without using <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> shows much better results than the conventional PI controller with using <b>force</b> <b>sensor.</b> Thus, aside from the benefit of providing a fail-safe control strategy for <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> failure, a much more stringent ABS cycle than currently used can be achieved with the proposed IARC to improve the friction force between the tire and the road for a shorter stopping distance. Such a much improved <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> control performance is also vital for future advanced vehicle control using EMB. ...|$|R

40|$|Cutting {{forces are}} {{important}} parameters {{to describe the}} manufacturing process. For an adjustment with regard to optimal cutting parameters and minimal tool wear {{it is necessary to}} know the quantity and components of the forces. The direct measuring of cutting forces by means of <b>force</b> <b>sensors</b> demands an intervention {{in the construction of the}} tool. Therefore <b>force</b> <b>sensors</b> seldom can be applied on working machine tools. On the other hand the indirect determination of cutting forces by measuring strain of machine components is possible without changing the machine characteristic or its construction in many cases. The sensors may be attached on components in the main flux of force or secondary flux of force. The position of tool and workpiece, different workpiece geometry and setting of tools are varying parameters that have a great influence on the deformation of machine components. In the beginning of the development stage of a sensor system these parameters are not known or hardly to es timate. FEM calculations have been done on two examples, a chuck and a revolver, to analyze the behaviour of strain with different loads and geometry. The results of the FEM calculation are implemented into a linear mathematical model as a basis for the development of a sensor system. In this model Hooke's law of material behaviour is assumed for the use of strain sensors. Installed on a chuck this sensor system rotates with the spindle speed. In addition to the cutting forces the influences of centrifugal <b>force</b> and <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> have to be taken into account.
