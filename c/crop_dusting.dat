25|$|From 1963 Fjellfly started <b>crop</b> <b>dusting</b> forests with {{fertilizer}} on {{a contract}} with Felleskjøpet. A Cessna 185 seaplane was bought for the job, which allowed it {{to be used for}} <b>crop</b> <b>dusting</b> in May and June, and be used for passenger flights the rest of the year. The first such mission took place on 3 May 1963. Although some of the operations took place from airstrips, most of the work was carried out using seaplanes. At the peak, four aircraft were used for crop dusting: two 185s, a Piper Super Cub and a Pilatus Porter. During the 1960s, Fjellfly had two domesticated bears which were held at the airport.|$|E

2500|$|On March 29, 1995, during congressional {{hearings}} on the US War on Drugs, Burton proclaimed that the US military [...] "should place an aircraft carrier {{off the coast of}} Bolivia and <b>crop</b> <b>dust</b> the coca fields." [...] It was later pointed out to him that (a) Bolivia is landlocked and has no coast (Burton was chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee); (b) the Bolivian coca fields (in the yungas and Amazon lowlands) are beyond the reach of any carrier-borne crop-duster, being separated from the nearest coastline (the Pacific coast of Peru and Chile) by the 20,000+ feet high peaks of the Andes; and (c) F-18s cannot crop-dust. While criticism of this misstatement was muted in Washington, it sparked a major anti-American backlash in Bolivia, derailing the same War on Drugs that Burton purported to be speaking for.|$|R
500|$|The airline was {{established}} as Vestfoldfly by Øyvind Skaunfelt in 1961. He {{had been working}} at Thor Solberg's aviation school at Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg, and offered to purchase the school and airplanes when Solberg retired. Two years earlier, Sandefjord Airport, Torp had opened a civilian sector and Skaunfelt decided to establish his company there. In May 1961, he received government permission for commercial flying. He started a newspaper route to Oslo Airport, Fornebu, and could also carry three passengers in his single-engined Cessna. The route continued onwards from Sandefjord to Tønsberg, Larvik and at Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. Vestfoldfly also started offering scenic trips and charter. During the summer, the airline also flew seaplanes south along the coast to Kragerø, Risør and Arendal. Other activities involved <b>crop</b> <b>dusting</b> of forest for Felleskjøpet. The airline also provided a target service for the military. Four aircraft were permanently used to tow a target about [...] behind the aircraft, and military personnel would practice shooting at the target.|$|E

40|$|Idaho’s {{tradition}} for famous potatoes {{is rooted in}} dust: long-term addition of dust creates rich, fertile soils. While fine air-borne silt provides nutrients and water-holding capacity important for <b>crops,</b> <b>dust</b> {{is also an important}} but understudied aspect of soil development. On a global scale, soils provide an important storage location for carbon, and constitute a reservoir for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Plants, microbes, and microorganisms are responsible for organic carbon formation, but inorganic carbon requires the presence of mobile Ca+ ions to mix with water and CO 2 from the atmosphere to produce calcium carbonate CaCO 3. Natural traps provide a unique opportunity to analyze the geochemistry of pure dust in the absence of pedogenesis, or soil-formation. We collected dust from crevices in rhyolite, basalt and granite outcrops, and compared major element oxides and trace element geochemistry using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS). This study (1) explores the chemical composition of pure dust as a primary soil forming material, (2) compares dust heterogeneity among different lithologies and throughout the watershed, and (3) constrains the origin of dust...|$|R

40|$|A {{decline in}} water quality {{attributed}} to excessive inputs of phosphorus {{has been observed}} in Lake Simcoe {{over the past few}} decades. Various studies have estimated that 25 – 50 % of the total phosphorus entering the lake is from atmospheric deposition. Bare soil exposure in the spring due to lack of vegetative cover, along with soil disturbance related to agricultural activities, results in higher susceptibility to wind erosion and dust emission. This study introduces the new concept of Dust Response Units (DRUs), which combine soil type and land use to determine the dust emission susceptibility based on the hourly variation of wind speed and monthly changes in soil cover due to crop growth. The Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) was used to determine dust emission suppression factors for a combination of 11 different soils and 6 dominant agricultural land uses, totaling 66 different DRUs in the Lake Simcoe airshed. Employing a widely used dust emission model and applying these dust emission suppression factors resulted in the identification of high risk DRUs. Twelve of the potential 66 DRUs were determined to contribute 85 % of the total <b>crop</b> <b>dust</b> emissions within the Lake Simcoe airshed, including sand, loam, sandy loam, and loamy sand soils combined with row crop, mixed, and hay and pasture land management operations. This study demonstrates a new method to map high priority areas for targeted implementation of dust control best management practices that could be useful in agri-cultural areas both within and beyond the Lake Simcoe airshed...|$|R

The Ag-1, designed by Fred Weick, was the first outcome of this programme and led some eight years later to the Piper PA-25 Pawnee, another Weick design. A CAA contract was awarded on 7 December 1949 which provided input from the CAA, the Department of Agriculture and two aircraft manufacturers. A country-wide survey conducted by the CAA, backed up with a series of personal interviews, established a user view of the necessary features of an aircraft intended for <b>crop</b> spraying, <b>dusting</b> and fertiliser application.

50|$|The Spellbinders travel large {{distances}} {{in their}} metal flying ships. Unlike aeroplanes, which operate on aerodynamic principles, flying ships generate lift through powerful magnetic fields. Each flying ship {{is equipped with}} a pair of large power stones on either side, which rotate slowly as the ship moves. This motion creates a magnetic field powerful enough to repel against another magnetic field created by the summoning towers. Flying ships can be used for transportation and also to <b>dust</b> <b>crops</b> with pesticide. Although the technology that powers them is impressive, flying ships generally move somewhat slowly. By the time of Paul's visit to the Spellbinder's world, only six remain in operation.|$|R

40|$|Crop {{seeds are}} often treated with {{pesticides}} before planting. Pesticide-laden dust particles can be abraded from the seed coating during planting and expelled into the environment, damaging non-target organisms. Drift of these dust particles {{depends on their}} size, shape and density. In this work, we used X-ray micro-CT to examine the size, shape (sphericity) and porosity of dust particles from treated seeds of various <b>crops.</b> The <b>dust</b> properties quantified in this work were very variable in different crops. This variability may {{be a result of}} seed morphology, seed batch, treatment composition, treatment technology, seed cleaning or an interaction of these factors. The intra-particle porosity of seed treatment dust particles varied from 0. 02 to 0. 51 according to the crop and generally increased with particle size. Calculated settling velocities demonstrated that accounting for particle shape and porosity is important in drift studies. For example, the settling velocity of dust particles with an equivalent diameter of 200 µm may vary between 0. 1 and 1. 2 m s- 1, depending on their shape and density. Our analysis shows that in a wind velocity of 5 m s- 1, such particles ejected at 1 m height may travel between 4 and 50 m from the source before settling. While micro-CT is a valuable tool to characterize dust particles, the current image processing methodology limits the number of particles that can be analyzed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Early-life {{experiences}} and environmental exposures {{have been associated}} with childhood asthma. To investigate further whether the timing of such {{experiences and}} exposures is associated with the occurrence of asthma by 5 years of age, we conducted a prevalence case-control study nested within the Children's Health Study, a population-based study of > 4, 000 school-aged children in 12 southern California communities. Cases were defined as physician-diagnosed asthma by age 5, and controls were asthma-free at study entry, frequency-matched on age, sex, and community of residence and countermatched on in utero exposure to maternal smoking. Telephone interviews were conducted with mothers to collect additional exposure and asthma histories. Conditional logistic regression models were fitted to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Asthma diagnosis before 5 years of age was associated with exposures {{in the first year of}} life to wood or oil smoke, soot, or exhaust (OR = 1. 74; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 2. 96), cockroaches (OR = 2. 03; 95 % CI, 1. 03 - 4. 02), herbicides (OR = 4. 58; 95 % CI, 1. 36 - 15. 43), pesticides (OR = 2. 39; 95 % CI, 1. 17 - 4. 89), and farm <b>crops,</b> farm <b>dust,</b> or farm animals (OR = 1. 88; 95 % CI, 1. 07 - 3. 28). The ORs for herbicide, pesticide, farm animal, and crops were largest among children with early-onset persistent asthma.
