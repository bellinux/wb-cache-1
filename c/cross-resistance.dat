Based on a strain collection of 1, 062 yeast isolates from a German/Austrian multicentre study, susceptibility pattern analysis (SPA) was used to determine the proportion of parallel and <b>cross-resistances</b> to eight antifungal agents (AFAs) encompassing flucytosine, amphotericin B, azoles (fluconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) and echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin).

30|$|Disinfectants are {{chemicals}} that {{are able to}} reduce the amount of germs on objects to be disinfected. They are regulated mainly in the EU Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR) 528 / 2012 [1]. They are used in several sectors by professional and non-professional users. The BPR separates disinfectants in five product types (Annex V): human hygiene, disinfectants and algaecides not intended for direct application to humans or animals, veterinary hygiene, food and feed area and drinking water [1]. In the professional sector, the use of disinfectants is very important to avoid infections, e.g. in hospitals or the food industry. The use of disinfectants in private homes by non-professional users however is intensely debated amongst scientists: In Germany, it is widely accepted that disinfectants should only be used by private persons if there are medical indications [2]. These might be infectious diseases of family members or if people in need of care are living in the household. The limitation of uses is due to the fact that disinfectants do not only inherit benefits but also might pose risks to humans and the environment [2]. Studies show that the use of disinfectants is only significantly reducing bacterial contamination in households if users follow a strict cleaning protocol [3, 4]. In a setting where households were not informed how to use a disinfectant, the prevalence of bacterial contamination was not reduced [3]. A study on the effects of antibacterial products on infectious disease symptoms showed that using antibacterial products did not result in a reduction of the primarily viral infectious disease symptoms [5]. Reports of resistances are often accompanied by reports of wrong uses or insufficient cleaning [6]. This may also cause <b>cross-resistances</b> to antibiotics [7]. For example, it is under discussion whether a resistance to benzalkonium chloride, a disinfectant, might lead to a resistance to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin [8]. For many disinfecting substances, data on possible <b>cross-resistances</b> is not available; and for this reason, it is unclear which active substances pose the highest risks of these <b>cross-resistances</b> [7]. However, quaternary ammonium compounds, biguanides (i.e. surface active agents) and phenolics are considered as high-risk biocides concerning resistance problems [7]. For several substances (isothiazolones, anilides, diamidines, inorganic acids and their esters, alcohols), little information is available on resistance or tolerance [7]. Due to ‘the nature of their interaction with the bacterial cell and their antimicrobial efficacy’ [7], the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) considers them as medium-risk biocides. Several disinfectants have irritating or sensitising properties. A study showed that concentrations of the sensitising substances CMI/MI, glutardialdehyde, formaldehyde and chloroacetamide in disinfectants are in the same order of magnitude that leads to sensitising effects in laboratory tests [9]. Risks for the human health were especially high for spray applications or the use of concentrates for the cleaning of surfaces [9]. Some disinfectants or their metabolites can reach the environment. For example, the metabolite of triclosan, methyl-triclosan, was detected in surface waters [10] and biota [11]. Triclosan is also used in cosmetic products and in these cases does not fall under the BPR. Especially disinfection-by-products (DBP) which result from the reaction of halogenated oxidising substances with organic matter might pose risks that we are not aware of at the moment [12].|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa is {{the third}} most common {{pathogen}} responsible for nosocomial infections and the prevalence of multiple resistant isolates has been increasing. Ninety-nine clinical isolates were studied {{in order to assess}} the current levels of susceptibility and <b>cross-resistances</b> of widely used antipseudomonal antibiotics against P. aeruginosa and to determine some resistance mechanisms by phenotypic methods. Methods MICs of isolates for nine antipseudomonal antibiotics were determined by the E test method. Results Thirty-six percent of isolates were resistant to more than one group of antibiotics. The rates of susceptible isolates were ciprofloxacin 75 %, amikacin 73 %, ceftazidime 65 %, meropenem 63 %, imipenem 63 %, piperacillin/tazobactam 60 %, cefoperazone/sulbactam 59 %, cefepime 54 % and tobramycin 44 %. The majority of carbapenem resistant isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and amikacin.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{spread of}} antibiotic-resistant bacteria has lent urgency {{to the search}} for antibiotics with new modes of action that are devoid of preexisting <b>cross-resistances.</b> We previously described a unique class of acyldepsipeptides (ADEPs) that exerts prominent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens including streptococci, enterococci, as well as multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we report that ADEP prevents cell division in Gram-positive bacteria and induces strong filamentation of rod-shaped Bacillus subtilis and swelling of coccoid S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It emerged that ADEP treatment inhibits septum formation at the stage of Z-ring assembly, and that central cell division proteins delocalize from midcell positions. Using in vivo and in vitro studies, we show that the inhibition of Z-ring formation is a consequence of the proteolytic degradation of the essential cell division protein FtsZ. ADEP switches the bacterial ClpP peptidase from a regulated to an uncontrolled protease, {{and it turned out that}} FtsZ is particularly prone to degradation by the ADEP–ClpP complex. By preventing cell division, ADEP inhibits a vital cellular process of bacteria that is not targeted by any therapeutically applied antibiotic so far.

40|$|Based on {{the current}} literature, a risk/benefit {{analysis}} of the antimicrobial impregnation of surgical sutures with triclosan is performed, focussing on efficacy and indication, risk of resistance development, toxicological characteristics, and environmental tolerance. From a toxicological point of view, there are no restrictions for triclosan-impregnated suturing materials. Environmental tolerance is also acceptable for this application area, because the amounts of triclosan involved pose no problems in terms of degradability. The use of surgical suturing material coated with triclosan is seen especially in contaminated wounds or where the risk of infection is high. In order to meet this requirement, the antimicrobial properties of triclosan are particularly emphasized. Both in vitro and in vivo, triclosan is highly effective against Staphylococcus spp., including MRSA, the pathogens most frequently involved in postoperative wound infections. Triclosan is not effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Alcaligenes spp., due to their intrinsic resistance against this agent. As long as the inducible resistance in vitro against triclosan is not clinically relevant, it does not speak against triclosan use in suturing material, especially because pure triclosan is applied only to a specific, limited area for a short time. However, because triclosan can induce in vitro the development of <b>cross-resistances</b> to antibiotics, the implementation of this agent must be exclusively limited to medically founded indications...|$|R

40|$|The {{resistance}} to detergents and detergent-induced tolerance of a gastrointestinal organism, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, were examined. The most remarkable observation was the rapid response of cells in contact with bile salts and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The killing by high concentrations of detergents was nearly instantaneous. A 5 -s adaptation with moderate sublethal concentrations of bile salts or SDS (0. 08 or 0. 01 %, respectively) was sufficient to induce significant adaptation against homologous lethal conditions (0. 3 % bile salts or 0. 017 % SDS). However, {{resistance to}} a subsequent lethal challenge progressively increased further to a maximum reached after 30 min of adaptation. Furthermore, extremely strong <b>cross-resistances</b> were observed with bile salts- and SDS-adapted cells. However, no relationship seems to exist between levels of tolerance and de novo-synthesized proteins, since blockage of protein synthesis during adaptation {{had no effect on}} induction of resistance to bile salts and SDS. We conclude that this induced tolerance to detergent stress is independent of protein synthesis. Nevertheless, the stress-induced protein patterns of E. faecalis ATCC 19433 showed significant modifications. The rates of synthesis of 45 and 34 proteins were enhanced after treatments with bile salts and SDS, respectively. In spite of the overlap of 12 polypeptides, the protein profiles induced by the two detergents were different, suggesting that these detergents trigger different responses in E. faecalis.

Only the availability of new pharmacological models will make it possible to select molecules with novel mechanisms of action, thus delaving resistance and allowing the development of new chemotherapeutic strategies. We reached this objective in mice. Our approach is hunged on fundamental and applied research begun in 1980 to investigate to phospholipid (PL) metabolism of intraerythrocytic Plasmodium. This metabolism is abundant, specific and indispensable for the production of Plasmodium membranes. Any drug to interfere with this metabolism blocks parasitic development. The most effective interference yet found involves blockage of the choline transporter, which supplies Plasmodium with choline for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, its major PL, this is a limiting step in the pathway. The drug sensitivity thereshold is much lower for the parasite, which is more dependent on this metabolism than host cells. The compounds show in vitro activity against P. falciparum at 1 to 10 nM. They show a very low toxicity against a lymphblastoid cell line, demonstrating a total abscence of correlation between growth inhibition of parasites and lymphoblastoid cells. They show antimalarial activity in vivo, in the P. berghei or P. chabaudi/mouse system, at doses 20 -to 100 -fold lower than their in acute toxicity limit.

40|$|In 1875, 7 {{years prior}} to the {{description}} of the Koch bacillus, Klebs visualized the first Streptococcus pneumoniae in a pleural fluid. Since then, this organism has played a determinant role in biomedical science. From a biological point of view, it was largely implicated in the development of passive and active immunization by serotherapy and vaccination, respectively. Genetic transformation was also first observed in S. pneumoniae, leading to the discovery of DNA. From a clinical point of view, S. pneumoniae is still today a prime cause of otitis media in children and of pneumonia in all age groups, as well as a predominant cause of meningitis and bacteremia. In adults, bacteremia is still entailed with a mortality of over 25 %. Although S. pneumoniae remained very sensitive to penicillin for many years, penicillin-resistance has emerged and increased dramatically over the last 15 years. During this period of time, the frequency of penicillin-resistant isolates has increased from &lt; or = 1 % to frequencies varying from 20 to 60 % in geographic areas as diverse as South Africa, Spain, France, Hungary, Iceland, Alaska, and numerous regions of the United States and South America. In Switzerland, the current frequency of penicillin-resistant pneumococci ranges between 5 and &gt; or = 10 %. The increase in penicillin-resistant pneumococci correlates with the intensive use of beta-lactam antibiotics. The mechanism of resistance is not due to bacterial production of penicillinase, but to an alteration of the bacterial target of penicillin, the so-called penicillin-binding proteins. Resistance is subdivided into (i) inter mediate level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] of penicillin of 0. 1 - 1 mg/L) and (ii) high level resistance (MCI &gt; or = 2 mg/L). The clinical significance of intermediate resistance remains poorly defined. On the other hand, highly resistant strains were responsible for numerous therapeutical failures, especially in cases of meningitis. Antibiotics recommended against penicillin-resistant pneumococci include cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and in some instances vancomycin. However, penicillin-resistant pneumococci tend to present <b>cross-resistances</b> to all the antibotics of the beta-lactam family and could even become resistant to the last resort drugs mentioned above. Thus, in conclusion, the explosion of resistance to penicillin in pneumococci is a ubiquitous phenomenon which must be fought against by (i) a strict utilization of antibiotics, (ii) the practice of microbiological sampling of infected foci before treatment, (iii) the systematic surveillance of resistance profiles of pneumococci against antibiotics and (iv) the adequate vaccination of populations at risk...|$|R

30|$|Because {{extensive}} {{information regarding}} both pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics {{is needed to}} actually judge the similarity of the mode of action {{of two or more}} chemicals [23], the preference of IA above CA based on the known or assumed mode of action has been questioned [23 – 26]. The classification of similar and dissimilar modes of action as applied in the present study relates to the pesticidal mode of action of the a.s., hence to the specific toxicity towards the target organisms based on the known molecular target and the development of <b>cross-resistances</b> in target organisms. No difference in the frequency distribution of MDR values was found between products with similarly and dissimilarly acting a.s. based on this pesticidal mode-of-action classification. Although the low percentage of products that contained a.s. with similar pesticidal modes of action among the investigated products may have limited the ability to detect systematic differences, the absence of differences indicates that the here assumed dissimilarity of the mode of action did overall not interfere with the applicability of CA. The available information about the mode of action of pesticidal a.s. in non-target organisms is generally limited and thereby hardly supporting a sound decision about the choice between IA and CA. Toxicity may be imposed by the same mode of action particularly when the targeted molecules mediate identical functions in the target organisms and the species used in the ecotoxicological testing, e.g., photosynthesis in weeds as target organisms of herbicides and algae or higher aquatic plants as non-target organisms. For other pesticidal a.s., the mode of action may differ between target and non-target organisms. Baseline toxicity (narcosis), i.e., a similar mode of action, is often assumed in the absence of documented specific toxicity, as for example regarding the toxicity of photosynthesis inhibitors towards heterotrophic organisms [8, 14]. Another example are de-methylation inhibitors (DMI fungicides, FRAC group G 1) that are designed to interfere with cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases in target fungi but can affect diverse and different biochemical pathways in various species and thereby display different modes of actions in non-target organisms [27]. These authors reported that in Daphnia magna, DMI fungicides from four different chemical classes were found to exhibit baseline toxicity as well as specific toxicity. The latter differed among substances, i.e., fenarimol and triadimefon affected embryonic eye development while pyrifenox affected molting [27]. Likewise, Ankley et al. [28] reported multiple modes of actions of the DMI fungicides prochloraz and fenarimol in fish. A classification of the similarity of the mode of action strictly with regard to the non-target test species in question would therefore likely result in a different classification of similarity and dissimilarity for these a.s. than that solely based on the pesticidal mode of action. In theory, this could allow detecting a bias related to the default application of the CA concept. However, the necessary detailed information about the modes of action of pesticides in various non-target test species will hardly ever be available, which precludes a verification of this hypothesis.|$|R
40|$|The {{quantity}} of infections caused by enterococci, in particular E. faecalis and E. faecium, {{has been increasing}} {{in the field of}} human medicine within the last years. Resistances to important antimicrobial agents have been increasing in this genus simultaneously. A connection with the application of antimicrobial agents in livestock farming is supposed. The target {{of this study was to}} determine the resistance behaviour of strains of enterococci isolated from cattle, pigs and food made of these animal species. Minced meat, raw sausages, ham and soft cheese were chosen for the analysis in particular since these could contain enterococci of animal origin and are intended to be consumed uncooked. Sixty herds of cattle (young bulls and calves), ninety seven herds of pigs and one hundred and sixty-six food samples from different regions of Germany were investigated. 1257 strains of enterococci were isolated out of them and identified to the species level. The genus Enterococcus was confirmed using the catalase test, pyrrolidonylarylamidase test and testing for growth in BHI broth with 6. 5 % NaCl. The species was diagnosed by examining haemolysis behaviour, pigment production, motility, the ability to reduce tetrazolium, the presence of arginine dihydrolase and a series of hydrocarbonate splitting tests. The resistance of five hundred and sixty-nine selected strains was determined to penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, gentamicin, tetracycline, erythromycin, tylosin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, enrofloxacin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, chloramphenicol, bacitracin, flavomycin and avilamycin using the microbroth dilution method. Strains possessing a mimimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to gentamicin higher than or equal to 256 mg/l were checked for high-level resistance with the Etest method. Glycopeptide-resistant strains were tested for the resistance genes vanA, vanB, vanC 1 and vanC 2 using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Resistance to penicillin occured in 11 %, 31 % and 4 % of the E. faecium strains isolated from cattle, pigs and food, respectively. Resistance to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was found in 3 % of the E. faecium isolates from pigs. The remaining strains (with the exception of one E. durans/hirae isolate) were susceptible to these beta-lactam antibiotics. High-level resistance to gentamicin was restricted to 2 % of the E. faecalis strains isolated from pigs and 1 % of the E. faecalis strains isolated from food. VanA-mediated high level resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics was found exclusively in three E. faecium strains isolated from pigs. Resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was observed in 56 %, 57 % and 23 % of the E. faecium strains isolated from cattle, pigs and food, respectively. The resistance rates of E. faecalis and E. faecium to tetracycline ranged between 16 % (E. faecalis isolated from cattle) and 37 % (E. faecalis isolated from pigs), to erythromycin between 6 % (E. faecalis isolated from cattle) and 49 % (E. faecium isolated from pigs) and to chloramphenicol between 4 % (E. faecium isolated from food) and 22 % (E. faecium isolated from cattle). E. faecalis (33 % susceptible strains isolated from cattle) was more susceptible to enrofloxacin than E. faecium (0 % susceptible strains isolated from cattle). The resistances to the antimicrobial growth promoters ranged from 0 % (E. faecium isolated from cattle to tylosin) to 100 % (E. faecium isolated from food to flavomycin). Cattle and pigs seem to have only little importance as a reservoir of enterococci with resistances to ampicillin, gentamicin and the glycopepetide antibiotics, which are the agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections in human medicine. The risk for the consumers to acquire such resistant enterococci via the food chain seems to be very small. Compared with this the resistance rate to the recently approved antimicrobial agent quinupristin/dalfopristin is rather high in E. faecium isolated from cattle, pigs and food. This problem is probably caused by the former use of the antimicrobial growth promoter virginiamycin in conventional animal fattening. Virginiamycin causes <b>cross-resistances</b> to quinupristin/dalfopristin in enterococci and has been banned in the EU since 1999. This ban is probably followed by a decrease of resistances to quinupristin/dalfopristin. Resistances to antimicrobial agents, which have importance in veterinary and human medicine but only a low significance in the treatment of enterococcal infections, e. g. tetracycline or erythromycin, were partly found quite frequently. A transfer of resistance genes to other genera of bacteria cannot be ruled out. This may imply a risk for the consumers, on the other hand the use of a certain {{quantity of}} antimicrobial active agents for the treatment of bacterial infections in farm animals seems to be indispensible. The risk for the consumers to acquire enterococci, which are resistant to the agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections, via the food chain seems to be very small...|$|R
50|$|The use of anti-malarials {{developed}} from similar basic chemical compounds {{can increase the}} rate of resistance development, for example <b>cross-resistance</b> to chloroquine and amiodiaquine, two 4-aminoquinolones and mefloquine conferring resistance to quinine and halofantrine. This phenomenon may reduce the usefulness of newly developed therapies prior to large-scale usage.|$|E
