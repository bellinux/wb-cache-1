5|$|Between the two {{unstable}} regimes {{mentioned in}} the previous section, and influenced by all the factors described above that contribute to balance (trail, mass distribution, gyroscopic effects, etc.), {{there may be a}} range of forward speeds for a given bike design at which these effects steer an uncontrolled bike upright. It has been proven that neither gyroscopic effects nor positive trail are sufficient by themselves or necessary for self-stability, although they <b>certainly</b> <b>can</b> enhance hands-free control.|$|E
25|$|It {{is the job}} of {{the system}} {{administrator}} force to deal with low-level conflict, and there must be both resources and a smooth transition plan from Leviathan to System Administrator responsibility, of which a classic successful example were the Operation Rankin plans that covered several ways in which Nazi power might end which is more a mission for police, which <b>certainly</b> <b>can</b> include a militarized force like the Constabulary in the post-WWII occupation of Germany.|$|E
25|$|His legacy <b>certainly</b> <b>can</b> be {{credited}} with {{contributions to the}} constitutional recognition of Muslims (historically revived as Bosniaks in 1993) as a constituent people within Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with the already recognised Croats and Serbs, and his persistent position in protecting those rights. He has also continually worked on protection of the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina within the Yugoslav federation and while he did begin some processes for which he would be criticized, many consider that without {{his involvement in the}} Yugoslav politics at the time Bosnia may have not had the political nor other potency to pursue the independence in the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|In many {{cultures}} of the Old and New Worlds, this gemstone has been esteemed {{for thousands of years}} as a holy stone, a bringer of good fortune or a talisman. The oldest evidence for this claim was found in Ancient Egypt, where grave furnishings with turquoise inlay were discovered, dating from approximately 3000BCE. In the ancient Persian Empire, the sky-blue gemstones were earlier worn round the neck or wrist as protection against unnatural death. If they changed colour, the wearer was thought to have reason to fear the approach of doom. Meanwhile, it has been discovered that the turquoise <b>certainly</b> <b>can</b> change colour, but that this is not necessarily a sign of impending danger. The change can be caused by the light, or by a chemical reaction brought about by cosmetics, dust or the acidity of the skin.|$|E
500|$|The Orr-led lineup also {{recorded}} That'll Work, a collaborative album with Chuck Berry's pianist, Johnnie Johnson. It was released later in 1993 via Nonesuch Records, and it comprised twelve songs which Johnson {{and the band}} wrote {{over the course of}} four days. The album featured Johnson on piano, as well as lead vocals on the title track and one other song; Jimmy Hall of Wet Willie also played harmonica and saxophone, and sang backing vocals. Thom Owens of Allmusic wrote of this album that [...] "They <b>certainly</b> <b>can</b> work a heavy, bluesy groove with dexterity, but they lack the gonzo charm they had on their debut, Pickin' on Nashville [...] — there simply isn't the sense of careening fun, nor is there the reckless fusions that resulted in such an invigorating listen." [...] One year later, Mercury released a greatest hits package, [...] It reprised singles and other songs from the band's first three albums, as well as [...] "Let's Work Together" [...] and a cover of The Beatles' [...] "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away," [...] which The Kentucky Headhunters had previously recorded on the 1994 tribute album Shared Vision: The Songs of the Beatles. After Still Pickin, The Kentucky Headhunters left Mercury.|$|E
2500|$|William Muir, {{like many}} other 19th century {{scholars}} divides Muhammad's life into two periods – Meccan and Medinan. He asserts that [...] "in the Meccan period of [...] life there <b>certainly</b> <b>can</b> be traced no personal ends or unworthy motives," [...] painting {{him as a man}} of good faith and a genuine reformer. However, that all changed after the Hijra, according to Muir. [...] "There [...] temporal power, aggrandisement, and self-gratification mingled rapidly with the grand object of the Prophet's life, and they were sought and attained by just the same instrumentality." [...] From that point on, he accuses Muhammad of manufacturing [...] "messages from heaven" [...] in order to justify a lust for women and reprisals against enemies, among other sins.|$|E

2500|$|Using a {{press release}} issued by the Archdiocese of Detroit, the Catholic Diocese of Scranton issued this {{statement}} {{in response to a}} planned speaking engagement of Voris in that diocese: [...] "The Diocese of Scranton has determined that Mr. Voris {{will not be allowed to}} speak in a Diocesan or parish facility. After these engagements were scheduled, the Diocese became aware of concerns about this individual’s views regarding other religious groups. In videos posted on the Internet, Mr. Voris makes comments that <b>certainly</b> <b>can</b> be interpreted as being insensitive to people of other faiths. The Catholic Church teaches us to respect all people, regardless of their faith tradition. Although the Diocese shares Mr. Voris’ support of efforts to protect human life, his extreme positions on other faiths are not appropriate and therefore the Diocese cannot host him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The unknown killer did not {{acquire a}} {{nickname}} {{until after the}} death of Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin. In the April 16 edition of the Texarkana Daily News, a heading read, [...] "Phantom Killer Eludes Officers as Investigation of Slayings Pressed". The story from the front page continued on page two with the title, [...] "Phantom Slayer Eludes Police". The Texarkana Gazette contained a small title on April 17 which read, [...] "Phantom Slayer Still at Large as Probe Continues". J.Q. Mahaffey, executive editor of the Texarkana Gazette in 1946, said that Calvin Sutton, the managing editor of the Gazette, had an acute sense for the dramatic in the news, which impelled him to turn to him and ask if they could not start referring to the unknown murderer as [...] "The Phantom". Mahaffey replied, [...] "Why not? If the SOB continues to elude capture, he <b>certainly</b> <b>can</b> be called a phantom!" ...|$|E
