A multicenter qualitative study with four patients included due to the rare combination of hereditary ataxia and ITB therapy was designed to elucidate participants experiences through semi-structured interviews. The transcribed text was analyzed according to content analysis guidelines. Overall we identified living in the present/taking {{one day at a time}} as the main theme covering the following categories: 1) Uncertainty about the future as a consequence {{of living with}} a hereditary disease; The disease; 2) Impact on life as a whole, 3) Influence on personal life in terms of feeling forced to terminate employment, 4) Limiting daily activities, and 5) ITB therapy, advantages, and disadvantages. Uncertainty about the future was the category that affected participants personal life, employment, and daily activities. The participants experience of receiving ITB therapy was expressed in terms of improved quality of life due to better body position and movement as well as better sleep and pain relief...|$|R

Benign <b>hereditary</b> <b>chorea</b> is a rare disorder. It was first described in 19671 2 and is characterised by the onset of non-progressive chorea in childhood. There is an absence of mental deterioration, although in one family recently reported the affected subjects had a lower IQ than their unaffected family members. 3 The pattern of inheritance {{is thought to be}} autosomal dominant; male to male transmission is known to occur, 4 5 and in reviewing the families reported up to 1975, Harper 6 suggested that there i...|$|R

50|$|Benign <b>hereditary</b> <b>chorea</b> (BHC), {{also known}} as benign {{familial}} chorea, is a rare autosomal dominant neurogenetic syndrome.

40|$|Aim Benign <b>hereditary</b> <b>chorea</b> is a dominantly inherited, childhood-onset hyperkinetic {{movement}} disorder characterized by non-progressive chorea and variable degrees of thyroid and respiratory involvement. Loss-of-function mutations in NKX 2. 1, a gene {{vital to the}} normal development and function of the brain, lungs, and thyroid, {{have been identified in}} a number of individuals. Method Clinical data from individuals with benign <b>hereditary</b> <b>chorea</b> identified through paediatric neurology services were collected in a standardized format. The NKX 2. 1 gene was analysed by Sanger sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and microarray analysis. Results Six of our cohort were female and four male, median age at assessment was 8 years 6 months (range 1 y 6 mo– 18 y). We identified 10 probands with NKX 2. 1 mutations; nine of these mutations are novel (including two whole-gene deletions) and one has been previously reported. Of the 10 individuals, eight presented with muscle hypotonia and four had evidence of hypothyroidism or respiratory involvement. Only three out of the 10 individuals had the full triad of ‘brain–lung–thyroid syndrome’ symptoms. Additional clinical characteristics occurring in individual participants included growth hormone deficiency, pes cavus, kyphosis, duplex kidney, and obsessive–compulsive disorder. Interpretation Our data suggest that the neurological phenotype is prominent in this condition and that many patients with benign <b>hereditary</b> <b>chorea</b> do not have the classic triad of brain–lung–thyroid syndrome. The extended phenotype may include obsessive–compulsive disorder and skeletal abnormalities...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackgroundBenign <b>hereditary</b> <b>chorea</b> {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} {{which is}} characterized by early onset, non-progressive choreic movement disturbance, with other hyperkinetic movements and unsteadiness also commonly seen. Hypothyroidism and lung disease are frequent additional features. The disorder is caused by mutations of the NKX 2 - 1 gene on chromosome 14. Case presentationA Norwegian four-generation family with eight affected was identified. All family members had an early onset movement disorder, starting before one year of age with motor delay and chorea. Learning difficulties were commonly reported from early school years. The family presented with choreic movements at rest, but other movements were seen; myoclonus, dystonia, ataxia, stuttering and tics-like movements. All patients reported unsteadiness and ataxic gait was observed in two patients. Videos are provided in the supplementary material. Most affected family members had asthma and a subclinical or clinical hypothyroidism. Sequencing revealed a mutation in the NKX 2 - 1 gene in all eight affected family members. ConclusionsThis is the first Norwegian family with benign <b>hereditary</b> <b>chorea</b> due to a mutation in the NKX 2 - 1 gene, c. 671 T[*]>[*]G (p. Leu 224 Arg). This family demonstrates well the wide phenotype, including dystonia, myoclonus and ataxia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is an inflammatory, autoimmune, {{demyelinating disease}} of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) that usually starts as a relapsing-remitting disease. In most patients the disease evolves into a <b>chronic</b> <b>progressive</b> phase characterized by continuous accumulation of neurological deficits. While treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) has improved dramatically over the last decade, the therapeutic options for <b>chronic</b> <b>progressive</b> MS, both primary and secondary, are still limited. In order to find new pharmacological targets for the treatment of <b>chronic</b> <b>progressive</b> MS, the mechanisms of the underlying neurodegenerative process that becomes apparent as the disease progresses need to be elucidated. New animal models with prominent and widespread progressive degenerative components of MS have to be established to study both inflammatory and non-inflammatory mechanisms of neurodegeneration.

40|$|In {{a search}} for early {{prognostic}} features in multiple sclerosis, the progression rate was calculated in 200 consecutive multiple sclerosis patients who had had a lumbar puncture, and correlated with age at onset, type of disease course, the patient's sex, {{as well as with}} indices of blood-brain barrier breakdown and intrathecal IgG synthesis. The present study demonstrates that age at onset plays a role in determining whether the disease will be remitting-relapsing or <b>chronic</b> <b>progressive.</b> Age at onset is also a factor determining the rate of progression of the remitting-relapsing form, but is without influence on the progression of the <b>chronic</b> <b>progressive</b> form.
