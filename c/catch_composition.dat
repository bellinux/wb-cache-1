40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This study {{estimates}} {{rates of}} shark depredation in the charter boat fishery on Protea Banks, KwaZulu-Natal. Previous estimates based on fisher surveys suggested that shark depredation {{is a concern}} locally and may distort fishing mortality estimates. Methods involved quantitative data collection by an onboard observer from November 2013 to January 2014. <b>Catch</b> <b>composition</b> data were collected to enable comparisons with the commercial and recreational catch returns used in monitoring and assessment. Results revealed an average depredation rate of 8. 4 % that varied depending on the species fishers targeted. Depredation was highest when catching pelagic species (18. 6 %) and lowest when catching reef species (1. 9 %). Depredation rates were highest in November (19. 6 %) and lowest in January (5. 3 %). Observed rates were highest on the Banks itself and immediately offshore (9. 9 %), but no depredation was observed inshore of the Banks. The most commonly identified sharks involved in depredation incidents were the dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) and the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus). Multi-dimensional scaling showed commercial <b>catch</b> <b>composition</b> to be significantly different from recreational and charter <b>catch</b> <b>composition,</b> mainly due to abundance of tuna in the recreational and charter sectors. No significant relationship was found between <b>catch</b> <b>composition</b> and shark depredation. Depredation is estimated to cost charter fishing operators 8 % of their revenue.

Spatial distribution of sets and differences in fishing operations among clusters were then compared to reveal apparent differences in fishing strategies. Three clusters comprised N 80 % of the total sets, and the <b>catch</b> <b>compositions</b> suggested targeting for either broadbill swordfish (two clusters) or bigeye tuna. The other two clusters were most similar to the tuna cluster, but their <b>catch</b> <b>compositions</b> indicated a mixed-species fishing strategy. Fishing operations were most different between sets in the tuna and swordfish clusters. Swordfish sets were characterized by (1) the largest vessels, (2) the least number of hooks per set, (3) the greatest number of lightsticks, (4) the longest set duration, (5) the highest percentage of night sets, (6) a larger percentage of sets within the full moon phase, and (7) the lowest percentage of sets within the main Hawaiian Islands Exclusive Economic Zone. Time series of CPUE for three species (bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and swordfish) based on different clusters were compared, and the most appropriate CPUE time series for resource monitoring are recommended. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.

The socio-economic conditions of the fishers are varied to fishing ground, type of fishing gear and marketing. The average total cost of CGN was higher than CT due to fishing grounds of CGN are further than those of CT and maintenance including replacement costs of CGN were rather high. However, the total revenue of CGN was higher than CT. The <b>catches</b> <b>composition</b> of CT mainly is small size crabs, thus the fishers have to boil and picking the meat for value added.

The average catch per trip is varied to seasons, the catch in rainy season was higher than dry season significantly. At present, the management of crab fishery is not well established. Any proper management measure did not apply to this fishery and results to the declining of swimming blue crab stock in the study area. Thus, in order to sustain crab fishery in Sikao District, appropriate management measures should be urgently implemented. The recommended measures are mesh size limit, size of crab to be caught, limit amount of fishing effort of individual fisher, and seasonal and area closure.

40|$|The Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR) holds a {{significant}} amount of scientific data covering various disciplines of the marine environment in the Greek Seas. The Institute of Marine Biological Resources (IMBR/HCMR) endeavors to assess the fishery resources by undertaking fishery independent experimental surveys, as well as monitoring the commercial fisheries activities with on-board observers. However, accession to these data and furthermore compatibility of the available formats was a complicated task, since data were either stored on a local intranet database or on many individual PCs. “IMAS-Fish” was developed to overcome these issues by: (i) homogenizing all the available datasets under a relational database, (ii) facilitating quality control and data entry, (iii) offering easy access to raw data, (iv) providing processed results through a series of classical and advanced fishery statistics algorithms, and (v) visualizing the results on maps using GIS technology. Available datasets cover among others: Fishery independent experimental surveys data (locations, species, <b>catch</b> <b>compositions,</b> biological data); Commercial fishing activities (fishing gear, locations, <b>catch</b> <b>compositions,</b> discards); Market sampling data (species, biometry, maturity, ageing); Satellite derived ocean data (Sea surface temperature, Salinity, Wind speed, Chlorophyll-a concentrations, Photosynthetically active radiation); Oceanographic parameters (CTD measurements); Official national fishery statistics; Fishing fleet registry and VMS data; Fishing ports inventory; Fishing legislation archive (national and EU); Bathymetry grids. Currently, the homogenized database holds a total of more than 100, 000, 000 records.

The purpose of study {{is to examine the}} fish <b>catch</b> <b>compositions</b> and kinds of fish species of the small pelagic purse seiner boat, the PPP and PHP influences on the purse seiner fishermen incomes, and compare the amount of PHP determined by the Government and of the study result PHP. Case study method was used the study about existing of purse seiner boat fishermen in Pekalongan City as the study location. The sampling technique was carried out systematically. The data analysis used the qualitative descriptive and t-test statistic analysis. The qualitative descriptive analysis was used for analyzing the fish <b>catch</b> <b>compositions</b> and kind of fish species and determining the fish prices. The t-test was used for analyzing the significant differences of the PPP and PHP influences on determind the small pelagis purse seiner boat fisherman incomes, and comparing the amount of PHP by Goverment and study result PHP too. The result of study showed that the fish <b>catch</b> <b>compositions</b> of the 30 GT or more purse seiner boat {{for the last five years}}, namely in the 1997 — 2001 in Pekalongan, indicated that there were fluctuations of the production amounts. From the average production amount of each fish kind of purse seiner boat fish catches for the last five years the largest fish kind composition was Layang followed by Lemuru, then Banyar, Tembang, Selar and the other fish kinds have the least compositions. Of the fish kinds the salted fish composition was larger than the fresh or iced fish composition. The highest price of the purse seiner boat fish catches was the species of Banyar/Kembung and the lowest one was Tembang species. Based on the fish quality price of fresh or iced fish price was higher than the salted one. The PPP and PHP influenced the incomes of fishermen, especially of the purse seiner boat owner. Income at the first trip of the boat owner who has paid the PPP and PHP has a negative value or the boat owner suffered a financial loss. Mean while the boat owner who has not paid the PPP and PHP yet has a high income per trip. For the income per trip of captain, motorist, skilled worker, and crew who both has and has not paid PPP and PHP yet was not influenced by the magnitude of fishery levies. The one-year income of the purse seiner boat owner who has paid the PPP and PHP were lower than the owners who have not yet. While the incomes among their captains, motorist, siklled worker, crews were not much different. The PHP value of the government calculation based on the old HPI (Floor Price of Fish; The Decision of Trade and Industry Minister No. 213 / 2001) was much higher than the one based on the study calculation.

Bycatch-related problems and knowlegde of king crabs’ behavior in relation to fishing gear are explained in detail. Escape vents which are implemented into the side panels of the presently used rectangular pots can faciliate the egress of captured sublegal-sized animals while the pot is on the seafloor and are regarded as a commom tool to reduce their unintentional retention.
