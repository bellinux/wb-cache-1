As a percentage of dry matter, the fruit bodies contain 39.0% <b>crude</b> <b>protein,</b> 1.4% lipids, 50.8% carbohydrates, and 8.8% ash.

5|$|A {{nutritional}} {{analysis of}} P.indusiatus (based on specimens collected from Nigeria) {{determined that the}} egg stage of the fungus contains (per 100g of fungus, dry weight) 33.6g of <b>crude</b> <b>protein,</b> 1.66g of fat, and 3.98g of carbohydrates. The egg stage was also measured to comprise 20.9g dietary fibre, and 88.76% moisture. The high levels of protein and fibre (which are comparable to values found in meat and vegetables, respectively) suggest that the egg form of P.indusiatus is a good food source. The concentration of several mineral elements, including potassium, sodium, and iron, was also favourable compared to fruits and vegetables, although the mineral composition in the fungus is dependent on their corresponding concentrations in the soil in which they grow.|$|E
5|$|Being herbivores, {{blackbuck}} graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing as well. They prefer sedges, fall witchgrass, mesquite, {{and live}} oak. They have occasionally been observed browsing on acacia {{trees in the}} Cholistan Desert. Oats and berseem {{were found to be}} palatable and nutritious to captive populations in a study. A study in the Velavadar Black Buck Sanctuary (Gujarat, India) showed that Dichanthium annulatum comprised 35 percent of their diet. Digestion of nutrients, especially crude proteins, was poor in summer, but more efficient in the rainy and winter seasons. Consequently <b>crude</b> <b>protein</b> intake in summer was very low, even below the recommended value. Blackbuck had a lower food consumption in summer. The fruits of Prosopis juliflora are often eaten, and blackbuck {{may play a role in}} their dispersal. Prosopis becomes a significant food item if grasses are scarce. Water is a daily requirement of the blackbuck.|$|E
40|$|Ten alfalfa {{varieties}} {{were tested}} at the Rimski Sancevi Experiment Field {{in the period}} 1991 - 1994. The following characteristics were analyzed: yield of dry matter, yield of green forage, stem length and diameter, lamina length and width, regeneration rate, number of intemodes, proportion of leaves {{and the content of}} <b>crude</b> <b>proteins.</b> Stem length, yield of green forage, regeneration rate and the proportion of leaves exhibited direct positive effects on dry matter yield. Number of internodes, lamina length and the content of <b>crude</b> <b>proteins</b> exhibited negative direct effects. Yield of green forage, stein length and regeneration rate exhibited also indirect positive effects, via other characteristics. They may be used as selection criteria in alfalfa breeding for increased yield of dry matter. In addition to the significant positive direct effect, the portion of leaves had negative indirect effects, via green forage yield, stem length, growth rate and the content of <b>crude</b> <b>proteins.</b> It is therefore not applicable in alfalfa breeding for increased yield of dry matter. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} resolve {{the problem of the}} {{excessive}} growth of phumdis that affects the lake ecosystem and local community, a study sponsored by the IndiaCanada Environment Facility was undertaken by the Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) to examine efficient ways of converting phumdis into briquettes as fodder and fuel pellets, which could be used to meet both energy demands within the region. Two options for the biomass conversion were studied. The first involved making briquettes of vegetative part of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to pelletise the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel. The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as feed material due to its higher crude fibre and <b>crude</b> <b>protein</b> content, but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose. The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12% de-oiled rice bran was found to be feasible for using them as fodder. The lower portion, which was densified to make fuel pellets, was found to be suitable for use as fuel. Such pellets were found to have an average calorific value of 3,400calories per kilogram (14,200kJ/kg) with ash content of 27%. Cost economics were worked out and the study had found it to be “an economically viable and an attractive proposition for the benefit of local population.” The study concluded that extraction of phumdi from the lake could also generate income for the local people who are dependent on the lake for their livelihood. Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake, thus converting the waste into wealth. The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners; this is reported to have been implemented.|$|E
