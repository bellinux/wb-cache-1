40|$|A new modular helical {{configuration}} named ""Modular Heliotron"" {{with clean}} and efficient helical magnetic divertor is proposed {{as an extension}} of the present conventional design of the <b>continuous</b> helical <b>coil</b> system. The sectored helical coils on one plane of the torus and the sectored returning vertical field coils on the other plane are combined. This coil system produces magnetic surfaces nearly equivalent to those of the l= 2 helical system with one-pair poloidal coils, and overcomes the defects of construction and maintenance difficulties of the <b>continuous</b> <b>coil</b> systems. This concept satisfies the compatibility between the coil modularity and the sufficient divertor-space utilization, different from previous modular coil designs.

This molecule is called coil-VaLd because it contains valine in the a heptad positions and leucine in the d heptad positions. In the trigonal crystal, three molecules, related by a crystallographic threefold axis, form a parallel three-helix bundle. The bundles are stacked head-to-tail to form a <b>continuous</b> <b>coiled</b> coil along the c-direction of the crystal.

40|$|Alpha-helical coiled coils {{represent}} a widespread protein structure motif distinguished by a seven-residue periodicity of apolar residues {{in the primary}} sequence. A characteristic "knobs-into-holes" packing of these residues into a hydrophobic core results in a superhelical, usually left-handed, rope {{of two or more}} alpha-helices. Such a geometry can be parameterized. For this purpose, a new computer program, TWISTER, was developed. With the three-dimensional coordinates as input, TWISTER uses an original algorithm to determine the local coiled-coil parameters as a function of residue number. In addition, heptad positions are assigned based on structural criteria. It is known that frequently encountered discontinuities in the heptad repeat, such as stutters and skips, can be tolerated within a <b>continuous</b> <b>coiled</b> coil but result in a local distortion of its geometry. This was explored in detail with the help of TWISTER for several two- and three-stranded coiled coils. Depending on the particular protein, stutters were found to be compensated locally by an unwinding of the superhelix, alpha-helical unwinding, or both. In the first case, there is often a local switch from a left-handed to a right-handed superhelix. In general, the geometrical distortion is confined to about two alpha-helical turns at either side of the stutter. Furthermore, stutters result in a local increase of the coiled-coil radius. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Transcription {{elongation}} {{is regulated}} by the cellular protein Hexim 1, which inhibits phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II by interacting with the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb. Hexim 1 binds directly to Cyclin T 1 of P-TEFb with its coiled coil domain that is subdivided into a highly polar N-terminal segment containing nonconservative residues in the dimer interface and a C-terminal segment with an evolutionarily conserved sequence composition. Here we show that the noncanonical sequence composition of the first coiled coil segment {{is required for the}} interaction with Cyclin T 1 while the second segment keeps the Cyclin T-binding domain dimeric upon binding. Both coiled coil segments exhibit distinct melting points as shown by heat denaturation experiments using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Deletion of the central stammer motif (Delta 316 - 318) leads to a single denaturation reaction, suggesting formation of a <b>continuous</b> <b>coiled</b> coil. Mutation of noncanonical coiled coil residues K 284 and Y 291 to valines in the dimer interface of the first segment only slightly increases its stability. Concomitantly, deletion of the stammer but not the double point mutation led to a reduced affinity for Cyclin T 1 as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry. Moreover, Cyclin T 1 bound Hexim 1 with a 1 : 2 stoichiometry, whereas truncation of the C-terminal coiled coil led to formation of an equimolar complex. These observations suggest that binding to Cyclin T 1 induces an asymmetry or sterical hindrance in the first coiled coil segment of dimeric Hexim 1 that disallows formation of a 2 : 2 complex as further supported by analytical ultracentrifugation and cross-linking experiments...|$|R

40|$|The {{stellarator}} system {{offers a}} distinct {{alternative to the}} mainline approaches to magnetic fusion power and has several potentially major advantages. Since the first proposal of the stellarator concept many reactor studies have been published and these studies reflect the large variety of stellarator configurations. The main representatives are the continuous-coil configurations and the modular-coil configurations. As {{a continuation of the}} LHD experiment two reactor configurations, FFHRI and FFHR 2, have been investigated, which use continuous helical windings for providing the magnetic field. The modular coil concept has been realized in the MHH-reactor study (USA 1997) and in the Helias reactor. The Helias reactor combines the principle of plasma optimisation with a modular coil system. The paper also discusses the issues associated with the blanket and the maintenance process. Stellarator configurations with <b>continuous</b> <b>coils</b> such as LHD possess a natural helical divertor, which can be used favourably for impurity control.

40|$|The physics {{studies have}} been carried out to {{optimize}} l= 2 heliotron/torsatron configurations having <b>continuous</b> <b>coil</b> system for the Large Helical Device (LHD), focusing on beta-orbit-divertor compatibility requirement, neoclassical & anomalous transports, bootstrap & Ohkawa currents, and divertor layer analysis. The optimal m number is found ~ 10 for the LHD system based on three physics criteria: MHD stability (beta is {{greater than or equal to}} 5 %), particle orbit confinement (loss-cone-free radius gamma_L is greater than or equal to 1 / 3 a_p (plasma minor radius)) and clean divertor layer (divertor-wall clearance Delta_dw is greater than or equal to 3 cm). The pitch parameter of helical coil gamma_c is determined mainly from the beta-divertor condition. For the detailed prediction of LHD plasma parameters, 2. 5 -dimensional equilibrium-transport simulations including empirical or drift wave turbulence models are carried out, which reveal that the global confinement time is sensitive to the edge electron anomalous transport although ripple loss through the ion channel is dominant in the plasma core. When ripple-transport-optimized configurations are adopted, the bootstrap current is increased; however, the Ohkawa current may be utilized cancel this current. The divertor layer study clarifies peculiar magnetic properties of thin curved divertor layers and suggests the effectiveness of helical divertors. From these physics considerations within the related engineering constraints, a final standard LHD configuration (m= 10, gamma_c= 1. 25, alpha^ast= 0. 1, where m, gamma_c and alpha^ast are toroidal mode, pitch and pitch modulation parameters of the helical coil, respectively) is determined. ...|$|R

40|$|Scalings of plasma {{configurations}} {{and engineering}} device parameters for l= 2 helical systems with <b>continuous</b> <b>coils</b> {{are derived from}} a wide range of computations. Using these scalings, typical optimized designs of heliotron/torsatron experimental devices with NbTi superconducting (SC) coils are obtained after maximizing a fusion product ntauT within both physics and engineering constraints. Optimization studies have been carried out for the next-generation Large Helical Device (LHD) having a major radius of ~ 4 m and magnetic field of ~ 4 Tesla, in which to demonstrate a divertor concept is one of key experiments. These studies clarified that higher gamma_c (helical coil pitch parameter) configurations (gamma_c is greater than or equal to 1. 25) with a larger plasma minor radius are not acceptable from the requirement of the clean divertor configuration. More compact lower-m systems (m is less than or equal to 8) are bounded by the equilibrium beta limit of the plasma and the stability limit of the SC coil current due to higher maximum magnetic field strength. Larger-aspect-ratio larger-m systems (m is greater than or equal 12, gamma_c ~ 1. 2 - 1. 3) with better neoclassical confinement properties are not effective because of a lower stability beta and a narrower clearance between the divertor layer and the wall. The divertor clearance becomes more severe in normal-conducting (NC) designs than in SC systems, and more than 5 -second plasma operations are not possible. An l= 2 /m= 10 /gamma= 1. 2 SC system is found as one of optimized high ntauT configurations for 4 m/ 4 T next-generation experiments with respect to the high-beta requirement, the clean divertor installation, the SC coil engineering and the cost optimization. ...|$|R

40|$|A new helical system(""Modular Heliotron"") with {{improved}} modular coils compatible with efficient closed helical divertor and good plasma confinement property is proposed {{based on a}} Heliotron system with <b>continuous</b> helical <b>coils</b> and one pair of poloidal coils. The physics optimization of this system {{as a function of}} the gap angle between adjacent modular coils has been carried out by means of vacuum magnetic surface calculations and finite-beta plasma analyses, and a new improved coil system is invented by combining sectored helical field coils with sectored returning poloidal field coils. The Modular Heliotron with standard coil winding law (reference Modular Heliotron) was previously proposed, but it is found that this is not appropriate to keep clean helical divertor and high beta configuration when the coil gap becomes large. By modulating the modular coil winding with outside-plus and inside-minus pitch modulation, almost the same good magnetic configuration as that of a conventional Heliotron can be produced. The optimal gap angle is determined {{as a function of the}} modulation parameter. This improved Modular Heliotron permits larger gap angle between adjacent modules and produces more clean helical divertor configuration than the reference Modular Heliotron. All these helical system are created by only modular coils without poloidal coils. ...|$|R

Evaluation of the industrial potential of the most prospective developments is underway. One of these areas being covered more in detail comprises high speed coating of fibers. The fibres are used for manufacturing damage-tolerant fiber reinforced ceramic composites.

The laser CVD method is characterized by several significant advantages, among them deposition rates of typically > 1 m/s, small volume cold-wall reactors, and short residence time of the fibers in the deposition chamber, which avoids fiber degradation.

40|$|Representation of {{the vacuum}} {{magnetic}} field {{by a set}} of harmonic functions is useful for an analysis of a magnetic configuration. To analyse a helical configuration precisely, a harmonic function describing a pure helicity of the configuration is desired specially in heliotrons, where the good quasi-symmetry is regarded as an advantage for a helical built-in divertor. Owing to the specific mode numbers in both the toroidal and the poloidal directions, the toroidal harmonic function is appropriate for a study of the helical field, when a practical method for a numerical calculation is provided. The helical components are analysed by a numerical calculation with high accuracy. From a spectral analysis of the field generated by a <b>continuous</b> helical <b>coil</b> the natural winding law was found to be peculiar by the fact that only the components resonant with the helicity of the coil are dominant. A deviation from the natural winding law, such as in a traditional winding law, causes an enhancement of off-resonant components. The unique toroidal coordinates, and hence, the unique spectral representation is practically determined from the condition that the field expression by a spectral series has the maximum area for the convergence. The high accuracy of the representation was applied to a numerical investigation of the intricate structure of a helical divertor. A reticular structure of the scrape-off layer in a helical system is visualizecl with a trace of unclosed separatrix. The field line at the X-point is a nearly pure helix in the toroidal coordinates, and it was confirmed that the deviation is sufficiently small for divertor baffles to be rigidly installed, even when some additional field is expected in an experiment. ...|$|R

The helical magnet system is comprised of modular units, with the coils connected through demountable, resistive joints at the module interfaces. Reactor maintenance can be performed through the access existing between the helical coils (without moving the coils). This design feature combines desirable features of both the <b>continuous</b> and modular <b>coil</b> concepts; the <b>continuous</b> current paths provide more vacuum rotational transform (i) and reduce the out-of-plane forces on the coils, while the demountable joints allow for magnet maintenance and replacement.

40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} {{mechanism}} of granule centralization in platelets, we permeabilized with saponin in either EGTA (5 mM) or calcium (1 or 10 t~M). Under all conditions, platelets retained 40 - 50 % of their total actin and> 70 % of their actin-binding protein (ABP) but lost> 80 % of talin and myosin to the supernatant. Thin sections of platelets permeabilized in EGTA showed a microfilament network under the residual plasma membrane and throughout the cytoplasm. Platelets permeabilized in calcium contained a microfilament shell partly separated from the residual membrane. The shell stained brightly for F-actin. A less dense microfilament shell was also seen in sections of ADP-stimulated intact platelets subsequently permeabilized in EGTA. In the presence of 1 mM ATP~S and calcium, myosin was retained (70 %) and was localized by indirect immunofluorescence in bright central spots that also stained intensely for F-actin. Electron micrographs showed centralized granules surrounded by a closely packed mass of microfilaments much like the structures seen in thrombin-stimulated intact platelets subsequently permeabilized in EGTA. Permeabilization in calcium, ATE and okadaic acid, produced the same configuration of centralized granules and packed microfilaments; myosin was retained and the myosin regulatory light chain became phosphorylated. Microtubule coil disassembly before permeabilization did not inhibit granule centralization. These results suggest a possible mechanism for granule centralization in these models. The cytoskeletal network first separates from some of its connections to the plasma membrane by a calcium-dependent mechanism not involving ABP proteolysis. Phosphorylated myosin interacts with the microfilaments to contract the shell moving the granules to the platelet's center. ESTING discoid platelets, when stimulated by various agonists, rapidly undergo striking changes in shape and structure.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{residual}} stress measurement in industrially manufactured tempered glass components has been {{addressed by the}} development and application of an experimental stress analysis technique known as pulsed magneto-photoelasticity. In the manufacture of tempered glass, residual stress is intentionally introduced in order to strengthen the material. However, {{the exact nature of}} the stress distribution remains unknown and, as a consequence, the strength of tempered glass products can vary significantly. A pulsed magneto-polariscope has been developed to allow the residual stress in glass to be quantified both through the thickness of the material and over the surface plane. Developments to the theory of the technique have enabled optical data, collected in the presence of multiple magnetic fields, to be used to provide a more detailed analysis of the residual stress distribution than has previously been possible. In the first phase of development, a pulsed magneto-polariscope with a <b>continuous</b> bore solenoid <b>coil</b> was designed and constructed. This enabled the proposed developments to be validated by testing birefringent specimens of epoxy resin and sectioned tempered glass test specimens. In addition, computer programs were developed to reduce the experimental complexity of the technique and to provide a platform upon which further research can be undertaken. The technique was extended by the design and inclusion of a novel component termed the dual coil solenoid which enabled high instantaneous magnetic flux densities to be generated, homogenously, over a wo. rking volume thereby allowing industrially manufactured tempered glass products to be analysed. Furthermore, this enabled test specimens of glass to be placed under known loads in order to precisely validate the proposed methodology. The pulsed magneto-polariscope was used to successfully quantify the residual stress distribution within a selection of automotive tempered glass products. The results demonstrated the ability of the developed technique to measure the residual stress in these components and to detect defects incurred in the manufacturing process.

40|$|Continuous {{counter current}} {{extraction}} (CCCE) or dual flow counter current chromatography (DFCCC) is a promising technique where components can be separated continuously by two liquid phases that flow {{in opposite directions}} through a <b>continuous</b> length of <b>coiled</b> tubing. Specially designed end connectors and a coil planet centrifuge allow each respective phase to be pumped into {{each end of the}} tubing and the other phase to elute at each opposite end. In this thesis the feasibility and the mechanics of CCCE are investigated using stroboscopic photography on an experimental rig and a specially built pilot-scale CCCE centrifuge. The mechanics of the hydrodynamics in the coil was investigated systematically by comparing the measured volumes with photographic images of the process. This investigation revealed that the phases are not distributed evenly throughout the coil, which was previously assumed, but that there is a transition area where the phases switch from mainly upper phase at the head end of the tubing to mainly lower phase at the tail end. This means that the sample encounter three different phase distribution zones in the coil. At the head the upper phase is the dominant phase with a small volume of lower phase running through. At the tail the reverse situation is found and lower phase is dominant. The third zone is a short segment of the coil where there is a transition between the dominant phase conditions that exist at each end. The position of the transition zone and the volume of the other two zones are profoundly affected by the relative flow rates of the two phases. This work indicates that the volume distribution in the coil is affected most by the upper phase flow rate. The pilot-scale CCCE centrifuge was used to successfully separate industrially supplied samples. Crude reaction liquor was processed in both batch and continuous modes achieving the separation of the multi-component mixture into two groups. Changing the flow rate combinations changed the location of elution of some of the components in the mixture. Separation efficiency was maintained even when sample loading was increased.

Continuous counter current extraction (CCCE) or dual flow counter current chromatography (DFCCC) is a promising technique where components can be separated continuously by two liquid phases that flow in opposite directions through a <b>continuous</b> length of <b>coiled</b> tubing. Specially designed end connectors and a coil planet centrifuge allow each respective phase to be pumped into {{each end of the}} tubing and the other phase to elute at each opposite end. In this thesis the feasibility and the mechanics of CCCE are investigated using stroboscopic photography on an experimental rig and a specially built pilot-scale CCCE centrifuge. The mechanics of the hydrodynamics in the coil was investigated systematically by comparing the measured volumes with photographic images of the process. This investigation revealed that the phases are not distributed evenly throughout the coil, which was previously assumed, but that there is a transition area where the phases switch from mainly upper phase at the head end of the tubing to mainly lower phase at the tail end. This means that the sample encounter three different phase distribution zones in the coil. At the head the upper phase is the dominant phase with a small volume of lower phase running through. At the tail the reverse situation is found and lower phase is dominant. The third zone is a short segment of the coil where there is a transition between the dominant phase conditions that exist at each end. The position of the transition zone and the volume of the other two zones are profoundly affected by the relative flow rates of the two phases. This work indicates that the volume distribution in the coil is affected most by the upper phase flow rate. The pilot-scale CCCE centrifuge was used to successfully separate industrially supplied samples. Crude reaction liquor was processed in both batch and continuous modes achieving the separation of the multi-component mixture into two groups. Changing the flow rate combinations changed the location of elution of some of the components in the mixture. Separation efficiency was maintained even when sample loading was increased. The separations were shown to be predictable with the dual flow theoretical model. EPSR...|$|R
