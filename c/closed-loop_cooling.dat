40|$|Sample surface {{charging}} and {{electron beam}} damage are common problems in scanning electron microscopy. In {{the case of}} serial block‐face electron microscopy (SBEM), sample charging prevents or restricts stack acquisition of non-conducting samples in high vacuum; beam damage imposes a lower limit on the cutting thickness (z-resolution). In this dissertation, I present three approaches that aim to overcome these limitations. To solve the charging problem, I implemented and evaluated two charge elimination techniques for SBEM: surface charge neutralization with an ion gun and automated in-chamber specimen coating with an electron beam evaporator. The ion gun method provides only partial charge neutralization in many cases, although high positive ion current densities are achieved. The automated in-chamber coating method, on the other hand, provides reliable charge elimination in all cases and allows the acquisition of SBEM stacks of non-conducting samples in high vacuum. Thin metallic films provide charge elimination for large sample surfaces and high beam currents, and reduce the signal-to-noise ratio less than the widely-used low-vacuum method. To reduce the effects of beam damage – {{with the aim of}} allowing thin cutting at higher electron doses – I have explored imaging and cutting at low temperatures (~ 100 K) using a <b>closed-loop</b> <b>cooling</b> system and a custom-built cryo-microtome.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to provide a}} foundation for evaluating the water costs associated with electricity production to calculate the avoided water cost of energy for solar PV and wind technologies relative to coal, natural gas, nuclear, geothermal, concentrated solar thermal, and biomass. Water consumption is estimated for energy production (fuel extraction and preparation) and electricity generation (power plant operation) using the best available information from published articles. The quantity of water consumed for electricity production is monetized for a Southern California case study based on the water rates of Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MET), which is the largest wholesale supplier of surface water in the United States. Water withdrawals are addressed but not included in the monetization of water consumption. Case studies of specific power plant’s water costs are used for comparison and demonstrate variation in water costs due to variations in water consumption. Water costs are estimated in terms of water cost ($) per unit energy generated (MWh). Since solar PV and wind energy are shown to have negligible water consumption relative to the other technologies, the water costs for each of the other electrical generation methods are equivalent to the water savings potential of solar PV and wind generated electricity. Compared to other evaluated electricity sources that could provide electricity to Southern California, solar PV and wind energy can save water worth $ 0. 76 /MWh for natural gas combined-cycle plants, $ 0. 94 /MWh for geothermal power plants, $ 1. 01 /MWh for biomass power plants, between $ 1. 14 and $ 1. 82 per MWh for concentrated solar thermal plants, $ 1. 43 /MWh for nuclear power plants, and $ 1. 49 /MWh for coal power plants. Results indicate that there are three processes that use substantial amounts of water: fuel extraction (for coal, natural gas, and nuclear), thermoelectric cooling of power plants and emissions controls such as carbon capture and sequestration. Carbon capture and sequestration are estimated to almost double the water consumption costs of coal and natural gas power plants. Of the evaluated technologies, only solar PV and wind do not require any of those three steps. Solar PV and wind energy can thus save the greatest value of water when displacing power plants that utilize (or may someday be required to utilize) all three of the major culprits of water consumption. Even the use of one of these processes (particularly thermoelectric cooling) results in substantial water consumption. Total water costs for each technology were normalized to the total expected electrical output of a typical capacity natural gas combined-cycle power plant to demonstrate the economies of scale of power production. Over a forty year lifespan of a typical natural gas power plant, total water consumption would result in $ 67 million worth of water (southern CA wholesale prices). To generate the same amount of electricity the total value of water consumption is estimated to be $ 83 million for geothermal plants, $ 89 million for biomass plants, $ 100 million to $ 160 million for concentrated solar thermal plants, $ 126 million for nuclear plants, and $ 131 million for coal power plants. The use of carbon capture and sequestration is expected to nearly double these total water costs. Compliance with environmental regulations can cause expenses much greater than water consumption. For example, mitigation costs for impingement and entrainment (a consequence of cooling water withdrawals) as well as the cost to convert to <b>closed-loop</b> <b>cooling</b> for environmental compliance can be considered costs associated with water usage. This is demonstrated by a case study about the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power regarding the elimination of once through cooling. The conversion to <b>closed-loop</b> <b>cooling</b> for the Haynes natural gas power plant is expected to cost $ 782 million, resulting in an estimated unit cost of $ 10. 66 /MWh. Finally, the economic benefits of the California Renewables Portfolio Standard are calculated with respect to water consumption. By holding hydroelectricity, geothermal, biomass and CST production constant and utilizing solar PV and wind to meet the 33 % renewables target by 2020, a water value of $ 28. 5 million/year can be conserved relative to meeting rising electricity demand with only natural gas combined-cycle generation. MET water rates increased 70 % from 2008 to 2014. If water rates increase at the same rate over the next six years, the water savings of the Renewable Portfolio Standard would be 70 % higher in 2020 dollars, equating to water savings of $ 48. 4 million per year...|$|E
40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION OF Usama Al-qalawi, For the Doctor of Philosophy {{degree in}} Economics, {{presented}} on Oct 10 th, 2008, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: On Estimation of Efficiencies of Hospitals and Electric Power Plants MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Subhash C. Sharma Our {{objective of this}} dissertation was to estimate the efficiencies and the sources of total factor productivity (TFP) of hospitals and the efficiency of electrics power plants. In addition, we investigate the effect of some factors {{that are associated with}} the variation in efficiency. A translog functional form is estimated using Stochastic Frontier analysis. Then we decompose productivity growth to its main components: the economic of scale effect, the technical progress effect and the change in inefficiency effect. The dissertation is divided to three main subjects. The first subject is about Californian hospitals, the second one is about Veterans hospitals and the last one is about the electricity power plants. The results indicate that the average cost efficiency of Californian hospitals is 90. 0 % during the period between 1995 and 2005. It implies that those hospitals on average have a cost about 10 % above the cost frontier that represent the minimum possible cost. Furthermore, the state of California lost $ 3. 28 billion a year on average as consequence of this cost inefficiency. The results also indicate that inefficiency increases over time and by raising the unoccupied beds. In addition, the results suggest that inefficiency decreases as the severity of inpatient increases, and is lower for psychiatric, big and DSH reporting hospitals. The average cost efficiency of the V. A. Hospitals was 81. 39 % during the period 2003 and 2007. The average annual total cost for VA hospitals during the period of study was $ 27. 4 billion; out of which $ 5. 4 billion can be attributed to inefficiency. Further more, the total annual cost of VA hospitals rise during the period of the study from $ 23. 3 billion to $ 31. 15 billion. With average growth rate equal to 7. 53 %. Cost efficiency of Californian hospitals increased during the period between 2003 and 2006 while it slightly decreases in the 2007. Moreover, a concave relation between the number of beds and the efficiency of VA hospitals are founded. As the number of beds increases, efficiency of hospitals increases until it reaches the highest point of efficiency when hospitals have between 100 and 149 beds. Then, it goes back down until it reaches its lowest value for hospitals that have more than 350 beds. Furthermore, average growth of TFP was - 0. 0320 during the period of study and this suggests that productivity of VA hospitals decreases due to technological recess. The results specify that the technical efficiency of electric power plants was 23. 63 %. Moreover, it indicates that older plants are more inefficient, and inefficiency will be lower for those plants that face higher net peak demand and have smaller size measured by the maximum generator name plate. In addition, we found that storage plants are more efficient than hydro electric plants and the latter plants are more efficient than renewable energy plants and all are more efficient than fossil energy fueled plants. Furthermore, we found that the most efficient generators are associated with gulf cooling water, used <b>closed-loop</b> <b>cooling</b> systems and are using a mix of petroleum and renewable fossil material as a fuel...|$|E
40|$|Introduction It {{is shown}} that a very simple model reproduces the {{pressure}} versus beam current characteristics of elongated single-cavity boiling water targets for 18 F production surprisingly well. By fitting the model calculations to measured data, values for a single free parameter, namely an overall heat-transfer coefficient, have been extracted for several IBA Nirta H 218 O targets. IBA recently released details on their new Nirta targets that have a conical shape, which constitutes an improvement over the original Nirta targets that have a cylindrical shape [1, 2]. These shapes are shown schematically in FIGURE 1. A study by Alvord et al. [3] pointed out that elevated pressures and temperatures {{in excess of the}} saturation conditions may exist in a water target during bombardment. However, as long as the rate of condensation matches the rate of vaporization, the bulk of the system should remain at saturation conditions. Superheated regions are therefore likely to form but also likely to disappear rapidly, typically on the scale of a few milliseconds. Even though the boiling process is generally quite complex, enhanced by radiation-induced nucleation, the presence of fast mixing mechanisms in the water volume justifies some simplifications to be made. Materials and Methods The simplified model assumes that the bulk of the target water has a constant temperature, which {{is the same as the}} inner wall temperature of the cavity, Tw. A second simplification is to neglect the temperature difference across the target chamber wall, which is only justified if the wall is thin. The boiling is not explicitly taken into consideration, including the rather complex boiling behaviour at the Havar window, except to acknowledge that it is the main mixing mechanism. Large temperature gradients can briefly exist in the water medium but they also rapidly disappear. A further assumption is that a single, overall convective heat-transfer coefficient can be applied, which is constant over the entire water-cooled surface. As the wall thickness is neglected, the heat-transfer surface is assumed to be the inner surface of the cavity, excluding the surface of the Havar window. One can then write down an energy balance between the beam heating and the convection cooling (Newton’s law of cooling), where Ib is the beam intensity, ΔE is the energy windows of the target (taken as 18 MeV), h is the convective heat-transfer coefficient, A is the inner cavity surface through which the heat has to be transferred from the target-water volume to the cooling water, and T 0 is the cooling-water temperature. The saturated vapour pressure of water versus temperature is a characteristic curve, given by the steam tables [4]. Assuming the bulk of the system at saturation conditions, one gets from (1) and (2). The function f is represented by a polynomial. The only unknown in Equation (3) is the overall convective heat-transfer coefficient h. Our approach was to adjust h until a good fit with a set of measured data was obtained. It also has to be mentioned that subtle differences in the physical properties between 18 O-water and natural water have been neglected. All in all, quite a few assumptions and simplifications are made in deriving Equation (3) and the system is, admittedly, much more complex. Nevertheless, the results obtained by applying Equation (3) are rather interesting. Results and Conclusion Measured data and corresponding calculations are shown in FIGURE 2 for three different conical targets and one cylindrical target. The extracted convective heat-transfer coefficients are pre-sented in TABLE 1 for the four cavities. As can be seen in FIGURE 2, while there are some differences between the data and calculated curves, especially towards lower beam currents, the overall agreement is remarkably good. It is possible that the better agreement towards higher beam intensities is related to more ebullient boiling and more rapid mixing, i. e. closer to the conditions that the model assumes. The values obtained for the overall convective heat-transfer coefficient are also remarkably similar. This tells us that, by and large, all the cavities perform in a similar way and the performance in terms of maximum operational beam current depends largely on the available surface to effectively remove the heat from. The values of h increase marginally if a smaller value is adopted for the cooling water. Note that the choice of T 0 = 30 ᵒC used to obtain the results in TABLE 1 is typical for the room temperature <b>closed-loop</b> <b>cooling</b> system used at iThemba LABS, once it has stabilized under operational conditions. A study by Buckley [5] on a quite different target design reports a value of h = 0. 49 W cm− 2 ᵒC− 1, which is reassuringly similar. That study describes a cylindrical target cavity with a volume of 0. 9 cm 3, 8 mm deep, cooled with 25 ᵒC water from the back, operated with a 15 MeV proton beam with an intensity of 30 µA. The Nb Nirta targets are typically filled with 18 O-water to about 60 % of the cavity volume (see refs. [1, 2] for the recommended values). The elongated shape, in combination with the ebullient properties of the boiling water, prevents burn-through. All the targets deliver the expected saturation yield. The targets are self-regulating ─ no external gas pressure is required. While the thermosyphon targets seemingly take advantage of a superior concept, we are now questioning whether this is really so in practice? It is not clear to us that the much more complex thermosyphon targets deliver any operational and/or performance advantages compared to the simple elegance of these elongated, single-cavity boiling target designs...|$|E

In view of the latest development in the GT technology, which enables them to be operated at TIT = 1, 600 °C, it is recommended to develop superalloys based on higher-melting temperatures (such as Mo-base superalloys). In such advanced GT engines with efficiencies exceeding 60 %, it is strongly recommended to use CCGT applying SC superalloys and TBC as well as <b>closed-loop</b> steam <b>cooling.</b> In TBC practice, it is recommended to first apply a Ni-rich coating close to the surface and then increasing the amounts of FGMs, alumina and zirconia, during EPD/EBPVD, for achieving the best results. Finally, a new chart for increasing power output has been presented, which would enable GT designers to manufacture GT engines with enhanced profitability.|$|R
30|$|A {{review of}} recent {{advances}} in gas-turbine technology shows outstanding developments in its major components (Gorji-Bandpy et al. 2010; Najjar and Zaamout 1996; Huda 2009, 2007, 1995). Superalloy and coating advancements for application in hot sections of gas turbine engines {{have resulted in a}} considerable economic leverage in power plants (Miller and Chambers 1987; Reed 2006). The modern CCGT uses single-crystal (SC) superalloys and special thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) and - in one design - <b>closed-loop</b> steam <b>cooling</b> to reach more than 60 % thermal efficiency. The application of advanced superalloys in the hot sections of modern gas-turbines also enables higher temperature operation. The operating temperatures in the first-stage and second-stage SC blades in modern CCGT lie in the ranges of 1, 300 °C to 1, 500 °C and 1, 000 °C to 1, 100 °C, respectively (see ‘Techniques to improve efficiency of GT engines’ section for details). For example, General Electric (GE) Inc. USA’s H-turbine (Fairfield, CN, USA) uses SC materials in first-stage blades and vanes that operate at a temperature of 1, 430 °C over a long service life. Similarly, first-stage turbine blades of Siemens’ SGT 5 - 8000 H machine (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) are made of specialized high-temperature alloy material to combat long-term effects of high temperatures at constant stress (to resist creep deformation).|$|R
40|$|Geothermal energy {{constitutes}} one of {{the most}} widely approved renewable sources to provide heat or produce electric power. Geothermal brines exist also in the area of Unterhaching in south Germany, where proper industrial facilities have been installed to supply with heat nearby households. Simultaneously, electrical energy is produced through a 5 - year operated Kalina cycle power plant that exploits the excess of the geothermal hot fluid. Kalina cycle is considered as an efficient power cycle that uses an ammonia-water mixture as working fluid. The high energy consumptions, required for the operation of the power plant in Unterhaching, prevent it from being more profitable. This thesis is based on analyzing the data acquisition system’s values and on deriving the specific parameters that influence the several efficiencies and power consumptions. The <b>closed-loop</b> indirect <b>cooling</b> system has been investigated, as pumps and fans constitute high energy consumers. Detailed models that simulate the cooling system have been developed, in order to evaluate the proposed technical solutions and confirm the improvement in the power generation process. Underground cooling of the ambient air that enters the cooling towers, through a buried pipe, has been proposed. This idea has been evaluated through the development of a model that simulates the heat transfer between the sub-soil and the air that flows along the pipe. Calculations verified that, through such an installation, the low temperature of the Kalina cycle can be reduced resulting in an increased power generation and constituting the buried pipe a profitable investment...|$|R
40|$|To achieve higher {{efficiency}} {{target of}} the advanced turbine systems, the <b>closed-loop</b> steam <b>cooling</b> scheme is employed to cool the airfoil. It is proven from the experimental results at laboratory working conditions that injecting mist into steam can significantly augment the heat transfer in the turbine blades with several fundamental studies. The mist cooling technique has to be tested at gas turbine working conditions before implementation. Realizing the fact that conducting experiment at gas turbine working condition would be expensive and time consuming, the computational simulation is performed to get a preliminary evaluation on the potential success of mist cooling at gas turbine working conditions. The present investigation aims at validating a CFD model against experimental results in a 180 -degree tube bend and applying the model to predict the mist/steam cooling performance at gas turbine working conditions. The {{results show that the}} CFD model can predict the wall temperature within 8 % of experimental steam-only flow and 16 % of mist/steam flow condition. Five turbulence models have been employed and their results are compared. Inclusion of radiation into CFD model causes noticeable increase in accuracy of prediction. The reflect Discrete Phase Model (DPM) wall boundary condition predicts better than the wall-film boundary condition. The CFD simulation identifies that mist impingement over outer wall is the cause for maximum mist cooling enhancement at 450 of bend portion. The computed results also reveals the phenomenon of mist secondary flow interaction at bend portion, adding the mist cooling enhancement at the inner wall. The validated CFD simulation predicts that average of 100 % mist cooling enhancement can be achieved by injecting 5 % mist at elevated GT working condition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Two-phase microjet {{impingement}} cooling is a po-tential {{solution for}} removing heat from high-power VLSI chips. Arrays of microjets promise to achieve more uniform chip tem-peratures and very high heat transfer coefficients. This paper presents {{the design and}} fabrication of single-jets and multijet arrays with circular orifice diameters ranging from 40 to 76 m, as well as integrated heater and temperature sensor test devices. The performance of the microjet heat sinks is studied using the integrated heater device {{as well as an}} industry standard 1 cm 2 thermal test chip. For single-phase, the silicon temperature dis-tribution data are consistent with a model accounting for silicon conduction and fluid advection using convection coefficients in the range from 0. 072 to 4. 4 W/cm 2 K. For two-phase, the experimental results show a heat removal of up to 90 W on a 1 cm 2 heated area using a four-jet array with 76 m diameter orifices at a flowrate of 8 ml/min with a temperature rise of 100 C. The data indicate convection coefficients are not significantly different from coefficients for pool boiling, which motivates future work on optimizing flowrates and flow regimes. These microjet heat sinks are intended for eventual integration into a <b>closed-loop</b> electroosmotically pumped <b>cooling</b> system.

40|$|It {{has been}} noted by {{industry}} {{that in addition to}} dramatic variations of temperature over a given blade surface, blade-to-blade variations also exist despite identical design. These variations result from manufacturing variations, uneven wear and deposition {{over the life of the}} part as well as limitations in the uniformity of coolant distribution in the baseline cooling design. It is proposed to combine recent advances in optical sensing, actuation, and film cooling concepts to develop a workable active, <b>closed-loop</b> modulated turbine <b>cooling</b> system to improve by 10 to 20 the turbine thermal state over the flight mission, to improve engine life and to dramatically reduce turbine cooling air usage and aircraft fuel burn. A reduction in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) can also be achieved by using the excess coolant to improve mixing in the combustor especially for rotorcraft engines. Recent patents filed by industry and universities relate to modulating endwall cooling using valves. These schemes are complex, add weight and are limited to the endwalls. The novelty of the proposed approach is twofold 1) Fluidic diverters that have no moving parts are used to modulate cooling and can operate under a wide range of conditions and environments. 2) Real-time optical sensing to map the thermal state of the turbine has never been attempted in realistic engine conditions...|$|R
