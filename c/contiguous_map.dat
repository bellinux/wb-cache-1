Level 3 products) of Earth system {{properties}} {{observed by}} satellites {{are central to}} understanding the spatiotemporal variability of these prop-erties. They also typically serve either as inputs into bio-geochemical models or as independent data for evaluating such models. Spatial binning is a common method for gen-erating <b>contiguous</b> <b>maps,</b> but this approach results {{in a loss of}} information, especially when the measurement noise is low relative to the degree of spatiotemporal variability. Such “binned ” fields typically also lack a quantitative measure of uncertainty. Geostatistical mapping has previously been shown to make higher spatiotemporal resolution maps possible, and also provides a measure uncertainty associated with the grid-ded products. This study proposes a flexible moving window block kriging method that {{can be used as a}} tool for creat-ing high spatiotemporal resolution maps from satellite data. It relies only on the assumption that the observed physical quantity exhibits spatial correlation that can be inferred from the observations. The method has several innovations rela-tive to previously applied methods: (1) it provides flexibil-ity in the spatial resolution of the <b>contiguous</b> <b>maps,</b> (2) it is applicable for physical quantities with varying spatiotem-poral coverage (i. e., density of measurements) by utilizing a more general and versatile data sampling approach, and (3) it provides rigorous assessments of the uncertainty associ-ated with the gridded products. The method is demonstrated by creating Level 3 products from observations of column-integrated carbon dioxide (XCO 2) from the GOSAT (Green-house Gases Observing Satellite) satellite, and solar induced fluorescence (SIF) from the GOME- 2 (Global Ozone Moni-toring Experiment- 2) instrument. ...|$|R

However, such maps are rare because it is difficult to develop both wild pedigrees and corresponding sets of molecular markers that are sufficiently large. We took advantage of two long-term field studies of pedigreed individuals and genomic resources originally developed for domestic sheep (Ovis aries) to construct a linkage map for bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis. We then assessed variability in genomic structure and recombination rates between bighorn sheep populations and sheep species. Results Bighorn sheep population-specific maps differed slightly in contiguity but were otherwise very similar in terms of genomic structure and recombination rates. The joint analysis of the two pedigrees resulted in a highly <b>contiguous</b> <b>map</b> composed of 247 microsatellite markers distributed along all 26 autosomes and the X chromosome. The map is estimated to cover about 84 % of the bighorn sheep genome and contains 240 unique positions spanning a sex-averaged distance of 3051 cM with an average inter-marker distance of 14. 3 cM. Marker synteny, order, sex-averaged interval lengths and sex-averaged total map lengths were all very similar between sheep species. However, in contrast to domestic sheep, but consistent with the usual pattern for a placental mammal, recombination rates in bighorn sheep were significantly greater in females than in males (~ 12 % difference), resulting in an autosomal female map of 3166 cM and an autosomal male map of 2831 cM. Despite differing genome-wide patterns of heterochiasmy between the sheep species, sexual dimorphism in recombination rates was correlated between orthologous intervals. Conclusions We have developed a first-generation bighorn sheep linkage map that will facilitate future studies of the genetic architecture of trait variation in this species.

The same chromosomal region is also a target for deletions in certain solid tumors. As an initial step toward the cloning of a potential tumor suppressor gene at 12 p 12. 3, we mapped the ETV 6 -CDKN 1 B region physically using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and P 1 -derived clone (PAC) contigs. The 1. 2 -Mb high-resolution, <b>contiguous</b> <b>map</b> extends from D 12 S 1095 to D 12 S 929 and consists of 19 PACs and 20 BACs. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis experiments confirmed {{the integrity of the}} clone-based map and identified six CpG islands in the region. A transcript map was generated by performing hybridization selection experiments with the genomic clones, by evaluating known 12 p ESTs for their presence in the contig, and by sequence analysis of CpG islands in the region. Altogether evidence was gathered for the presence of the recently published LRP 6 gene and at least seven other new genes in this chromosomal region. The CLAPS 3 gene, mapped between D 12 S 391 and D 12 S 358, was reassigned to chromosome 5 since genomic sequencing demonstrated the chromosome 12 p sequence to be a pseudogene. Polymorphic CA repeats were identified approximately every 100 kb, which will support future analysis of loss of heterozygosity in tumors. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of leukemia patients with del(12 p) further refined the commonly deleted segment to 600 kb between ETV 6 and D 12 S 358, which apparently excludes CDKN 1 B. Methylation changes of the CpG islands in the ETV 6 -CDKN 1 B interval were assessed by Southern analysis for leukemia patients with hemizygous 12 p deletions. A "de novo" methylation was detected only at the LRP 6 CpG island in 2 of 22 leukemia patients tested and was confirmed by methylation-sensitive PCR and sequencing. The genomic structure of LRP 6 was elucidated to allow screening for inactivating mutations, but only intragenic polymorphisms were identified. Hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with gene promoters is reported as a common mechanism for gene silencing and tumor suppressor inactivation. Therefore the consequences of the LRP 6 CpG island methylation and its role in the observed phenotype need further investigation. status: publishe...|$|E

Many of these satellites provide global-scale observations, but these observations are often sparse and noisy. By contrast, <b>contiguous,</b> global <b>maps</b> are often most useful to the scientific community (i. e., Level  3 products). We develop a spatio-temporal moving window block kriging method to create <b>contiguous</b> <b>maps</b> from sparse and/or noisy satellite observations. This approach exhibits several advantages over existing methods: (1)  it allows for flexibility in setting the spatial resolution of the Level 3 map, (2)  it is applicable to observations with variable density, (3)  it produces a rigorous uncertainty estimate, (4)  it exploits both spatial and temporal correlations in the data, and (5)  it facilitates estimation in real time. Moreover, this approach only requires {{the assumption that the}} observable quantity exhibits spatial and temporal correlations that are inferable from the data. We test this method by creating Level  3 products from satellite observations of CO 2 (XCO 2) from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), CH 4 (XCH 4) from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment- 2 (GOME- 2).

The technique utilizes optical "reporter" microbeads immobilized in {{a thin layer of}} transparent and inert hydrogel on top of the surface. The hydrogel has minimal density and therefore diffusion in and across it is like in water. Imaging the immobilized microbeads over time provides quantitative concentration measurements at each location where an optical reporter resides. Using image analysis in post-processing these spatially discrete measurements can be transformed into <b>contiguous</b> <b>maps</b> of the dynamic concentration field across the entire surface. If the microbeads are small enough relative to the dimensions of the region of interest and sparsely applied then chemical imaging will not noticeably affect the evolution of concentration fields.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that as animals explore their environment they build and maintain a cognitive map, an internal representation of their surroundings (Tolman, 1948). We tested this hypothesis using a task designed to assess the ability of rats to make a spatial inference (take a novel shortcut) (Roberts et al., 2007). Our findings suggest that rats are unable to make a spontaneous spatial inference. Furthermore, they bear similarities to experiments which have been similarly unable to replicate or support Tolman’s (1948) findings. An inability to take novel shortcuts suggests that rats do not possess a cognitive map (Bennett, 1996). However, we found evidence of alternative learning strategies, such as latent learning (Tolman & Honzik, 1930 b), which suggest that rats may still be building such a representation, although {{it does not appear}} they are able to utilise this information to make complex spatial computations. Neurons found in the hippocampus show remarkable spatial modulation of their firing rate and have been suggested as a possible neural substrate for a cognitive map (O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978). However, the firing of these place cells often appears to be modulated by features of an animal’s behaviour (Ainge, Tamosiunaite, et al., 2007; Wood, Dudchenko, Robitsek, & Eichenbaum, 2000). For instance, previous experiments have demonstrated that the firing rate of place fields in the start box of some mazes are predictive of the animal’s final destination (Ainge, Tamosiunaite, et al., 2007; Ferbinteanu & Shapiro, 2003). We sought to understand whether this prospective firing is in fact related to the goal the rat is planning to navigate to or the route the rat is planning to take. Our results provide strong evidence for the latter, suggesting that rats may not be aware of the location of specific goals and may not be aware of their environment {{in the form of a}} <b>contiguous</b> <b>map.</b> However, we also found behavioural evidence that rats are aware of specific goal locations, suggesting that place cells in the hippocampus may not be responsible for this representation and that it may reside elsewhere (Hok, Chah, Save, & Poucet, 2013). Unlike their typical activity in an open field, place cells often have multiple place fields in geometrically similar areas of a multicompartment environment (Derdikman et al., 2009; Spiers et al., 2013). For example, Spiers et al. (2013) found that in an environment composed of four parallel compartments, place cells often fired similarly in multiple compartments, despite the active movement of the rat between them. We were able to replicate this phenomenon, furthermore, we were also able to show that if the compartments are arranged in a radial configuration this repetitive firing does not occur as frequently. We suggest that this place field repetition is driven by inputs from Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) in neighbouring brain regions which are in turn greatly modulated by inputs from the head direction system. This is supported by a novel BVC model of place cell firing which predicts our observed results accurately. If place cells form the neural basis of a cognitive map one would predict spatial learning to be difficult in an environment where repetitive firing is observed frequently (Spiers et al., 2013). We tested this hypothesis by training animals on an odour discrimination task in the maze environments described above. We found that rats trained in the parallel version of the task were significantly impaired when compared to the radial version. These results support the hypothesis that place cells form the neural basis of a cognitive map; in environments where it is difficult to discriminate compartments based on the firing of place cells, rats find it similarly difficult to discriminate these compartments as shown by their behaviour. The experiments reported here are discussed in terms of a cognitive map, the likelihood that such a construct exists and the possibility that place cells form the neural basis of such a representation. Although the results of our experiments could be interpreted as evidence that animals do not possess a cognitive map, ultimately they suggest that animals do have a cognitive map and that place cells form a more than adequate substrate for this representation...|$|E

We present a novel cache-aware code positioning optimization driven by worst-case execution time (WCET) information.

This cache model is combined with a formal WCET timing model, resulting in a cache conflict graph weighted with WCET data. This conflict graph is then exploited by heuristics for code positioning of both basic blocks and entire functions. Code positioning is able to decrease the accumulated cache misses for a total of 18 real-life benchmarks by 15. 5 % on average for an automotive processor featuring a 2 -way setassociative cache. These cache miss reductions translate to average WCET reductions by 6. 1 %. For direct-mapped caches, even larger savings of 18. 8 % (cache misses) and 9. 0 % (WCET) were achieved.

An idealized daily temperature curve was used to convert daily temperature records from 43 weather stations, taken throughout the twentieth and late nineteenth centuries, into an hourly dataset, which was then converted to units of winter chill. Besides exposing temporal trends in winter chill, the data could be spatially interpolated, yielding <b>contiguous</b> <b>maps</b> of typical winter chill in Germany around 2010, as well as chilling losses since 1950. Throughout Germany, winter chill varied between 1700 and 3000 Chilling Hours or 125 and 150 Chill Portions. The areas of highest winter chill were located in the northern parts of the country. For the whole of Germany, there were no significant temporal trends. The extent of interregional variation in winter chill depended on the chilling model used. While the Chilling Hours Model showed strong declines in winter chill for the areas around Dresden and Leipzig, {{as well as for the}} Lake Constance region, the Dynamic Model did not detect such dramatic changes. More than a decline in winter chill, increased heat during the winter months might become a challenge to German fruit growers.

Recent developments (Hall et al., 2011, 2008; Hilker et al., 2011 a, 2010 a) {{permit us to}} infer photosynthetic forest light use efficiency (ϵ) using multi-angle measurements of photochemical reflectance index (PRI) from the CHRIS/PROBA satellite imaging spectrometer, thus completing a long sought-after capability to remotely sense the major inputs driving gross primary production GPP i. e., ϵ and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). In this first of two companion papers we introduce the theoretical underpinnings of an innovative approach that utilizes our recent developments to produce remotely sensed and spatially explicit maps of ϵ and GPP from space, and a data assimilation approach to extend the spatially explicit maps to diurnal, daily and annual time scales. We quantify GPP using the traditional radiation-limited approach of Monteith (1972); however we apply it in an innovative way. [I] Using CHRIS/PROBA we quantify ϵ at each satellite overpass for a 625 km 2 area at 30 m resolution. [II] We use a novel physiologically-based multivariate function of APAR, temperature and water vapor pressure deficit model (described herein) {{and use it to}} down-regulate ϵ at 30 minute intervals.

In the second part of this study (Hilker et al., 2011 b) we demonstrate and validate our approach over eight different forest flux tower sites in North America...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} largest <b>contiguous</b> <b>maps</b> of projected mass density obtained from gravitational lensing shear. We use data from the 154 [*]deg^ 2 covered by the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). Our study is the first attempt to quantitatively characterize the scientific value of lensing maps, which could serve {{in the future as}} a complementary approach {{to the study of the}} dark universe with gravitational lensing. We show that mass maps contain unique cosmological information beyond that of traditional two-point statistical analysis techniques. Using a series of numerical simulations, we first show how, reproducing the CFHTLenS observing conditions, gravitational lensing inversion provides a reliable estimate of the projected matter distribution of large-scale structure. We validate our analysis by quantifying the robustness of the maps with various statistical estimators. We then apply the same process to the CFHTLenS data. We find that the two-point correlation function of the projected mass is consistent with the cosmological analysis performed on the shear correlation function discussed in the CFHTLenS companion papers. The maps also lead to a significant measurement of the third-order moment of the projected mass, which is in agreement with analytic predictions, and to a marginal detection of the fourth-order moment. Tests for residual systematics are found to be consistent with zero for the statistical estimators we used. A new approach for the comparison of the reconstructed mass map to that predicted from the galaxy distribution reveals the existence of giant voids in the dark matter maps as large as 3 ° on the sky. Our analysis shows that lensing mass maps are not only consistent with the results obtained by the traditional shear approach, but they also appear promising for new techniques such as peak statistics and the morphological analysis of the projected dark matter distribution...|$|R
40|$|The Geostationary Carbon Process Mapper (GCPM) is an earth science {{mission to}} measure key {{atmospheric}} trace gases and process tracers related {{to climate change}} and human activity. The measurement strategy delivers a process based understanding of the carbon cycle that is accurate and extensible from city to regional and continental scales. This understanding comes from <b>contiguous</b> <b>maps</b> of carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), carbon monoxide (CO), and chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) collected up to 10 times per day at high spatial resolution (~ 4 km × 4 km) from geostationary orbit (GEO). These measurements will capture the spatial and temporal variability of the carbon cycle across diurnal, synoptic, seasonal and interannual time scales. The CO 2 /CH 4 /CO/CF measurement suite has been specifically selected because their combination provides the information needed to disentangle natural and anthropogenic contributions to atmospheric carbon concentrations and to minimize key uncertainties {{in the flow of}} carbon between the atmosphere and surface since they place constraints on both biogenic uptake and release as well as on combustion emissions. Additionally, GCPM's combination of high-resolution mapping and high measurement frequency provide quasi-continuous monitoring, effectively eliminating atmospheric transport uncertainties from source/sink inversion modeling. GCPM uses a single instrument, the “Geostationary Fourier Transform Spectrometer (GeoFTS) ” to make measurements in the near infrared spectral region at high spectral resolution. The GeoFTS is a half meter cube size instrument designed to be a secondary “hosted” payload on a commercial GEO satellite. NASA and other government agencies have adopted the hosted payload implementation approach because it substantially reduces the overall mission cost. This paper presents a hosted payload implementation approach for measuring the major carbon-containing gases in the atmosphere from the geostationary vantage point, to affordably advance the scientific understating of carbon cycle processes and climate change...|$|R
25|$|That 1975 map, {{the first}} Cahill-Keyes projection, {{launched}} a decades long quest to perfect it. One of his goals is a map with a 1:1 million scale, {{about half the}} size of a football field. Each one degree geocell would be large enough to stand in. While the physical Master Map as he calls it, remains a dream, in 2010, his partner Mary Jo Graça, using Keyes's extensive calculations, plotted the entire projection and in 2011 digitized the entire map. Absent the physical version, a 9,000 square foot pdf of that full size map can be easily navigated on a home computer. It is the first <b>contiguous</b> world <b>map</b> at a resolution showing all one-degree geocells (except five degrees at the poles). Keyes likewise commissioned the first-ever one-degree globe from Joe Roubal in 2013.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Contiguous {{processor}} allocation improves {{both the}} network and the application performance, by decreasing the congestion probability among communication of different applications. Consequently, the average, standard deviation and worst-case latency of the network is decreased signifi-cantly. This makes the contiguous allocation a good solution for time-critical applications with bounded deadlines. On the other hand, non-contiguous allocation will increase the system throughput significantly. Isolated nodes are utilized and more applications can finish their job in a time unit. However, this will lead to poor network metrics, unsuitable for real-time applications. In this work, we combine these two approaches in order to manage workloads with mixed-critical characteristics. Real-time applications are mapped contiguously, while non-critical applications are allowed to get dispersed over the available system nodes. Results show over 50 % improvement in worst-case latency and 100 times improvement in deadline misses.

40|$|The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) {{instruments}} are spatially-scanning UV spectrometers that have produced daily global images of total ozone {{over the last}} 21 years since {{the launch of the}} Nimbus 7 satellite. The instruments use a total ozone retrieval algorithm pioneered by J. V. Dave and C. L. Mateer for the Nimbus 4 Backscatter Ultraviolet (BUV) instrument, designed by D. F. Heath. The TOMS ozone maps have revealed the relations between total ozone and atmospheric dynamics, and shown the dramatic losses of ozone in the Antarctic ozone hole and the Northern hemisphere. The accepted long-term trends in global, regional, and local ozone are derived from data from the Nimbus 7 TOMS and three successive TOMS flights on Russian, Japanese, and American satellites. The next TOMS flight will be launched in 2000. The <b>contiguous</b> <b>mapping</b> design and fortuitous choice of TOMS wavelengths bands also permitted imaging of a second atmospheric gas, sulfur dioxide, which is transient due to its short lifetime. The importance of this measurement was first realized after the eruption of El Chichon volcano in 1982. The extreme range of sizes of volcanic eruptions and the associated danger require observations from a distant observing platform. The first quantitative time series of the input of sulfur dioxide by explosive volcanic eruptions into the atmosphere thus was developed from the TOMS missions. Finally, the Rayleigh and aerosol scattering spectral characteristic and reflectivity complete the four dominant pieces of information in the near UV albedo of the Earth. The four parameters are derived with a linear algorithm, the absorption coefficients of the gases, and effective paths computed from radiative transfer tables. Absorbing aerosol clouds (smoke, dust, volcanic ash) are readily identified by their deviation from a Rayleigh signature. The greatest shortcoming of the TOMS dataset is the 24 hour time resolution that is produced by the polar orbit of the satellite. Dynamic phenomena, such as upper air fronts that modulate total ozone and volcanic eruptions of sulfur dioxide and ash, cannot be adequately resolved. It is hoped that UV observations from geostationary satellites will soon be made to test the value of this unique information in weather forecasting and aviation safety...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{run-time}} mapping algorithm, CASqA, for networked many-core systems. In this algorithm, {{the level of}} contiguousness of the allocated processors (α) can be adjusted in a fine-grained fashion. A strictly contiguous allocation (α = 0) decreases the latency and power dissipation of the network and improves the applications execution time. However, it limits the achievable throughput and increases the turnaround time of the applications. As a result, recent works consider non-contiguous allocation (α = 1) to improve the throughput traded off against applications execution time and network metrics. In contradiction, our experiments show that a higher throughput (by 3 %) with improved network performance can be achieved when using intermediate α values. More precisely, up to 35 % drop in the network costs can be gained by adjusting the level of contiguity compared to non-contiguous cases, while the achieved throughput is kept constant. Moreover, CASqA provides at least 32 % energy saving in the network compared to other works.

40|$|Page {{intentionally}} {{left blank}} to facilitate double-sided printingSUMMARY This project tested the potential for transferring ShoreZone data to the new Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification System (CMECS; Madden et al 2009). ShoreZone is a relatively mature coastal habitat mapping system with nearly 100, 000 km of <b>contiguous</b> coastline <b>mapped</b> in Alaska, British Columbia and Washington. If such a data cross-walk is possible, a substantial CMECS dataset could be created from existing data. To test the cross-walk approach, three pilot areas from Sitka Sound were selected. These areas represented about 122 km of shoreline, 522 alongshore units and 1, 966 across-shore components. A variety of exposures, landforms, substrate, biota and salinity regimes are represented within these three pilot sections. A flat database was created to capture data using the CMECS classification protocol. ShoreZone data were transferred from five tables or databases to the CMECS database. An estimated 75 - 80 % of the ShoreZone data was easily transferred. The 20 - 25 % {{that could not be}} transferred relates primarily to the fundamentally different spatial mapping units of ShoreZone and CMECS. The primary ShoreZone mapping unit is an alongshore segment or shore unit (522 in the tes...|$|R
40|$|Progress in {{complete}} genomic sequencing of human chromosome 21 {{relies on the}} construction of high-quality bacterial clone maps spanning large chromosomal regions. To achieve this goal, we have applied a strategy based on nonradioactive hybridizations to contig building. A <b>contiguous</b> sequence-ready <b>map</b> was constructed in the Down syndrome congenital heart disease (DS-CHD) region in 21 q 22. 2, as a framework for large-scale genomic sequencing and positional candidate gene approach. Contig assembly was performed essentially by high throughput nonisotopic screenings of genomic libraries, prior to clone validation by (1) restriction digest fingerprinting, (2) STS analysis, (3) Southern hybridizations, and (4) FISH analysis. The contig contains a total of 50 STSs, of which 13 were newly isolated. A minimum tiling path (MTP) was subsequently defined that consists of 20 PACs, 2 BACs, and 5 cosmids covering 3 Mb between D 21 S 3 and MX 1. Gene distribution in the region includes 9 known genes (c 21 –LRP, WRB, SH 3 BGR, HMG 14, PCP 4, DSCAM, MX 2, MX 1, and TMPRSS 2) and 14 new additional gene signatures consisting of cDNA selection products and ESTs. Forthcoming genomic sequence information will unravel the structural organization of potential candidate genes involved in specific features of Down syndrome pathogenesis...|$|R
