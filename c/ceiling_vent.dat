50|$|A {{classical}} Trombe wall, also generically {{called a}} vented thermal storage wall, has operable vents near {{the ceiling and}} floor levels of the mass wall that allow indoor air to flow through them by natural convection. As solar radiation heats the air trapped between the glass and wall and it begins to rise. Air is drawn into the lower vent, then into {{the space between the}} glass and wall to get heated by solar radiation, increasing its temperature and causing it to rise, and then exit through the top (<b>ceiling)</b> <b>vent</b> back into the indoor space.

50|$|The two {{classrooms}} in Block A are very intact, retaining {{most of their}} early linings, joinery and hardware. As a consequence they are important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of early school design under RG Suter (1868-1873), and changes to school design under Robert and John Ferguson (1879-1893) to incorporate requests by educationalists for more windows, greater ventilation, and wide verandahs. The differing approaches to school design demonstrated in the early Waterford school building include: the different window layouts in the two rooms; the exposed roof timbers in the 1871 room compared with the ceiling lining in the 1888-1889 room with battened <b>ceiling</b> <b>vent</b> leading to a gable vent (now blocked up); the exposed framing inside the gable {{end of the second}} classroom (now enclosed with fibrous sheeting); and the differences in window pivoting arrangements. The external framing also is laid out differently in the two building parts.|$|E
50|$|Control of {{building}} design {{was transferred to}} the Department of Public Works in 1893 and the department's architects trialled a number of technical innovations. Queensland's education architecture became markedly more advanced and the range of standard building types increased. The most noticeable change in Queensland school architecture was the introduction of high-set buildings. This provided better ventilation as well as further teaching space and a covered play space underneath. Also, windows were rearranged and enlarged and sills were lowered to approximately 1m above floor level. By 1909 windows were altered so that the maximum amount of light came from one direction and desks were rearranged so that this light fell onto the left hand side of students. Since students were forcedly right-handed, no shadow would be cast onto the page. The wall supporting the blackboard had no windows. This often meant a complete transformation of the fenestration of existing older buildings. Dormers were sometimes added to the roof to provide better light and ventilation and the larger classrooms favoured in earlier designs were partitioned to create smaller ones with better lighting. Interiors became lighter and airier and met with immediate approval from educationalists. A technical innovation developed at this time was a continuous ventilation flap on the wall at floor level. This hinged board could be opened to increase air flow into the space and, combined with a <b>ceiling</b> <b>vent</b> and large roof fleche, improved internal air quality and decreased internal temperatures effectively. This type was introduced around 1909 and was constructed until approximately 1920. Significantly, Dr Eleanor Bourne was appointed the first Medical Inspector of Schools in 1911 and under her instruction the relationship between classroom environment and child health was given prominence. Accordingly, school architecture evolved through iteration and experimentation to improve interior light and ventilation.Such design innovations were included in a new building for the Boys' School at Bowen, constructed in 1917 {{to the west of the}} 1884 boys' building. Called the Big Room, it was a high-set timber building with a gable roof and a northerly and southerly verandah. It had a large number of windows in the gable end walls with sill heights approximately 1m from floor level. It incorporated a hinged board, <b>ceiling</b> <b>vent,</b> and large roof fleche for ventilation. The roof fleche was removed at some time prior to 2006. This building survives and in 2012 is named Block C.In 1919 an Honour Board memorialising 70 past students who served in World War I was installed in the Big Room and unveiled by the mayor in the presence of a crowded audience. The board took the form of a Grecian temple facade decorated to represent marble. It was claimed to be the largest in a North Queensland school, measuring 5 ft 6in wide by 6 ft high (1.67m x 1.82m). This board was moved to the Bowen Historical Museum some time after its installation although no evidence has been discovered as to when or why it was moved.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{focuses on}} the {{combustion}} efficiencies and further the heat release rates for pool fires in <b>ceiling</b> <b>vented</b> compartments. The concept of plume equivalence ratio (PER) is introduced to express the ventilation conditions for the flames in such compartments. The transient PER is estimated using the fire plume theories because the complex bi-directional vent flow {{makes it impossible to}} measure or calculate directly. The combustion efficiencies can thus be predicted utilizing the empirical correlation proposed by Tewarson, and subsequently the heat release rates can be decided in combination with the fuel mass loss rates. Heptane pool fires in a small-scale <b>ceiling</b> <b>vented</b> compartment were experimentally investigated. The increment of the opening size had limited impacts on the fuel mass loss rates, but significantly raised the oxygen concentrations in the compartment; however, the oxygen concentrations at the bottom began to decrease earlier. The PERs inclined with the burning procedure until extinction in general indicating the ventilation conditions for the flame grew worse; the combustion efficiencies declined correspondingly. Increasing the opening size may improve the ventilation conditions for the flame in general and consequently increase the combustion efficiencies but it seemed to have little impacts on the heat release rates...|$|R

A ventilation factor of ceiling vented compartment Φ was defined to determine the <b>ceiling</b> <b>vent</b> size.

40|$|Sizing of {{horizontal}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>vent</b> {{in a tall}} atrium is usually based on vent flow models with unidirectional flow. This is only good for natural vents with large pressure differences between inside and outside. For low pressure differential across the horizontal <b>ceiling</b> <b>vent</b> as experienced in some atrium fires, bidirectional smoke flow rates were observed. The extraction rate through the vent would be reduced, giving poor performance of the smoke exhaust system. Bidirectional flow across a <b>ceiling</b> <b>vent</b> {{will be discussed in}} this paper. Models available in the literature will be briefly reviewed first. A new model was developed on studying effects of bidirectional flow across a horizontal vent on the smoke layer interface height.

40|$|AbstractThe self-extinction {{behavior}} of N-heptane pool fire {{located in a}} ceiling-vented compartment is investigated experimentally. The compartment is a rectangular chamber of 1. 00 m (L) × 1. 00 m (W) × 0. 75 m (H) with only a <b>ceiling</b> <b>vent</b> with sizes between 0 and 0. 490 m × 0. 490 m. Three sizes of pans with the diameters of 0. 10 m, 0. 141 m and 0. 20 m were {{at the center of}} the compartment with similar initial fuel thickness. The impact of vent area on fuel consumption and flame extinction time is mainly examined as the result, meanwhile the local oxygen concentration near the fire source and the mass loss rate of fuel are also reported. The result shows that the pool fire burning behavior can be classified into four types according to the <b>ceiling</b> <b>vent</b> size. The extinction time te of first type of fire nearly equals to the closed condition, while it grows sharply with vent size for the second type of fire. When the fire belongs to the third type, te decreases with vent size due to the growth of fuel burning rate, and for the fourth type, te keeps constant again with the well-ventilated/condition. Based on species concentration, the <b>ceiling</b> <b>vent</b> size can be normalized into (ρ∞g 1 / 2 Av 5 / 4) /(mF”AF). An empirical exponential relationship between self-extinction time ratio and the dimensionless <b>ceiling</b> <b>vent</b> size was proposed, and the results well ntegrate all the profiles of self-extinction time of different fire sizes...|$|E

The compartment was 1 m (W) × 1 m (L) × 0. 75 m (H) and the area of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>vent</b> varied in six dimensions. Fire source was n-heptane pool with three different diameters, 0. 1 m, 0. 141 m and 0. 2 m, respectively. The fuel mass loss rate, gas temperature profile and oxygen concentration in the compartment were measured and flame behaviors were recorded by a video camera. The results showed that flame extinctions were due to two factors, oxygen concentration and fuel quantity. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>vent</b> only had a small impact on the mass loss rate and gas temperature profile when the fire extinction was due to low oxygen concentration. Additionally, mass loss rates showed same values when compared to free mass loss rate for small fires, even the fire was self-extinction.
