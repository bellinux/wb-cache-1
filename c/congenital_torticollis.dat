50|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>torticollis</b> {{constitutes}} {{the majority of}} cases seen in clinical practice. The reported incidence of <b>congenital</b> <b>torticollis</b> is 0.3-2.0%. Sometimes a mass, such as a sternocleidomastoid tumor, is noted in the affected muscle at the age of two to four weeks. Gradually it disappears, usually by the age of eight months, but the muscle is left fibrotic.|$|E
50|$|A {{multitude}} of conditions {{may lead to}} the development of torticollis including: muscular fibrosis, congenital spine abnormalities, or toxic or traumatic brain injury.A rough categorization discerns between <b>congenital</b> <b>torticollis</b> and acquired torticollis.|$|E
50|$|Studies and {{evidence}} from clinical practice show that 85-90% {{of cases of}} <b>congenital</b> <b>torticollis</b> are resolved with conservative treatment. It is possible that torticollis will resolve spontaneously but chance of relapse is possible.|$|E

40|$|Background {{and study}} aim: Torticollis is the {{postural}} deformity of {{head and neck}}. <b>Congenital</b> Muscular <b>Torticollis</b> (CMT) is a postural deformity of head and neck detected at birth or shortly after birth, primarily resulting from unilateral shortening of Sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM). In neonates and infants, patient may be cured conservatively by physiotherapy but surgery is the treatment of choice for children and adolescents. There are various techniques of surgery. Division of both sternal and clavicular head of SCM is very easy method which was practiced in this study. Here we show our experience regarding conservative and surgical management of <b>congenital</b> muscular <b>torticollis</b> in neonates, infants and older children. Patients and Methods: This is a retrospective case study among sixteen patients of <b>congenital</b> muscular <b>torticollis.</b> The cases were enrolled consecutively between Nov...|$|R
50|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>Torticollis</b> is {{presented}} at 1-4 weeks {{of age and}} a hard mass usually develops. It is normally diagnosed using ultrasonography and a colour histogram or clinically through evaluating the infant's passive cervical range of motion.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that physical therapy is a viable option for treating torticollis in a non-invasive and cost-effective manner. It {{has been shown that}} while outpatient infant physiotherapy is effective, home therapy performed by a parent or guardian is just as effective (if not more) in reversing the effects of <b>congenital</b> <b>torticollis.</b> Lateral neck flexion and overall range of motion can be regained quicker in newborns when parents conduct physical therapy exercises several times a day.|$|E
50|$|A Korean {{study has}} {{recently}} introduced an additional treatment called microcurrent therapy {{that may be}} effective in treating <b>congenital</b> <b>torticollis.</b> For this therapy to be effective the children should be under three months of age and have torticollis involving the entire sternocleidomastoid muscle with a palpable mass and a muscle thickness over 10 mm. Microcurrent therapy sends minute electrical signals into tissue to restore the normal frequencies in cells. Microcurrent therapy is completely painless and children can only feel the probe from the machine on their skin.|$|E
40|$|Adult {{presentation}} of neglected <b>congenital</b> muscular <b>torticollis</b> (CMT) is rare. Therefore, efficacy of surgical treatment for adult CMT is unclear.

Results: From a total of 91 CMT infants, 67 % were boys and the mean age was 20 weeks. Difficult labour history was present in 72. 9 % cases, 61. 1 % from primiparous mothers and 14 had an abnormal delivery presentation. Cervical palpation revealed a tumour in 43. 8 % cases {{and there was a}} limitation in range of motion of the neck in 63. 8 %. All children have had home program executed by caregivers and 78 were following a rehabilitation program. Most children showed a complete regression of the condition and only one needed corrective surgery.

Methods: We collected the medical records of all patients diagnosed with <b>congenital</b> <b>torticollis</b> in the last 3 years at Shriners Hospital, Mexico City. The cases of <b>congenital</b> <b>torticollis</b> treated with surgery were selected and we evaluated the type of surgical technique, bleeding, time of surgery and complications, {{as well as the}} associated diagnoses of hip dysplasia. Results: We found 11 patients, of whom 7 met the inclusion criteria. Three women and four men with mean age of 10. 7 years, five of whom had right, and two left side affections. All were surgically treated, five with unipolar and two with bipolar release. The surgery time was similar in both techniques and no complications were found in any of the groups. In two cases there were associated diagnoses, Klippel-Feil syndrome and congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV) in one and psychomotor retardation in another. No association was found with hip dysplasia. All patients had improved range of movement and head tilt. There were no complications related to the surgical procedure or need for reintervention in our patients.

40|$|Objectives To assess {{effectiveness}} of early and intensive physiotherapeutic management of <b>congenital</b> muscular <b>torticollis</b> and determine number of visits to physiotherapy department to achieve maximum clinical improvement {{in relation to}} age of initiation of treatment. Setting Physiotherapy department, Base Hospital, Horana. Method A prospective study was done from May to December 2002 on babies brought for treatment of <b>congenital</b> muscular <b>torticollis.</b> Intensive physiotherapy was given by a physiotherapist twice daily for 1 week and the mothers instructed in the procedure. Further physiotherapy was given by mothers at home with regular visits to the physiotherapy department. On complete resolution of torticollis, babies were referred back to the well baby clinic where they were followed up until one year of age. For statistical evaluation, Student’s t-test was used. Results 19 babies, ages ranging from 18 - 90 days, had been referred for treatment of <b>congenital</b> muscular <b>torticollis</b> during study period. 11 were female. 16 were diagnosed during first 2 - 3 weeks of life, and 3 at age of 3 months. 11 had left sided sternocleidomastoid tumour, 7 had right sided tumour and one had sternocleidomastoid shortening without a palpable tumour. There were 17 spontaneous vaginal deliveries (16 cephalic, 1 breech) and 2 vacuum extractions. In 14 cases mothers were primigravidae.

30|$|In this study, {{there were}} no {{differences}} in birth characteristics in children with left- and right-sided torticollis, between boys and girls or between the conservatively treated and the children who needed surgery.

None experienced moderate or severe asphyxia.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} <b>congenital</b> muscular <b>torticollis</b> is unclear. Birth trauma or intrauterine {{malposition}} {{is considered to}} be the cause of damage to the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the neck. Other alterations to the muscle tissue arise from repetitive microtrauma within the womb or a sudden change in the calcium concentration in the body which causes a prolonged period of muscle contraction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Congenital</b> muscular <b>torticollis</b> is {{the third}} most common {{congenital}} musculoskeletal anomaly after dislocation of the hip and clubfoot. When diagnosed early, {{it is obvious that}} it can be managed with good or excellent results. The aim of this prospective {{study was to determine the}} efficacy of surgery in neglected adult cases. Methods From January 2003 to June 2007, 18 adult skeletally matured patients were surgically treated for neglected <b>congenital</b> muscular <b>torticollis</b> and prospectively followed (at least one year). Bipolar release was performed in all patients. Radiography and the modified Lee's scoring system which included function and cosmesis, were used to measure the surgical results. Complications were also recorded. Results Four cases were lost during follow-up. Of the remaining 14 patients, 10 cases were males and 4 females. The age at operation ranged from 18 to 32 (average 21. 9) years. The mean follow-up period was 2. 5 years (range 1 – 5 years). Excellent results were noted in 7 patients, good in 5, and poor in 2 patients. Significant improvement (> 10 °) of the cervico-thoracic scoliosis was noted only in 3 of 10 patients. Conclusion Patients with <b>congenital</b> muscular <b>torticollis</b> can benefit from surgical treatment even in adulthood. Surgical bipolar sectioning of the sternocleidomastoid muscle should be considered even in adults with irreversible facial and skeletal deformities. The surgery restores the range of neck motion and resolves the head tilt; therefore it can improve the quality of life. This procedure is an effective and relatively complication-free method. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar a evolução clínica e comparar a eficácia do tratamento fisioterapêutico intensivo ou mínimo, em neonatos e lactentes com torcicolo congênito. MÉTODOS: Foram atendidas no Ambulatório de Fisioterapia e Cirurgia Pediátrica do Hospital de Clínicas da Universidade Estadual de Campinas 47 crianças com torcicolo congênito. Analisaram-se, retrospectivamente, antecedentes maternos, neonatais, apresentação clínica e tratamento fisioterapêutico, classificado de acordo com a freqüência das sessões. O tratamento intensivo foi definido como sessões de fisioterapia {{realizadas}} pelo fisioterapeuta no ambulatório, acrescidas de exercícios diários realizados pelos pais em domicílio. O tratamento mínimo foi considerado quando apenas o fisioterapeuta realizava as sessões semanalmente no ambulatório, sem a participação dos pais. RESULTADOS: Quanto às características demográficas da população, observou-se: idade média materna= 26 anos; parto normal= 40 (85 %); mães primigestas= 35 (75 %); idade média ao diagnóstico= 50 dias. A presença de nódulo intramuscular foi notada em 46 (98 %) pacientes. As seguintes doenças estiveram associadas: luxação congênita de quadril igual= 4 (8 %); fratura de clavícula= 2 (4 %); pé torto congênito= 1 (2 %). O tratamento intensivo foi realizado em 34 (72 %) pacientes e a cura observada em 100 %, após 74 dias, em média. O tratamento mínimo foi aplicado em 13 (28 %) pacientes e a cura observada em dez (77 %), tratados em média por 130 dias. CONCLUSÕES: O torcicolo congênito apresentou evolução clínica favorável em ambos os grupos. O tratamento intensivo propiciou maior índice de cura em menor tempo de tratamento. OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate the}} clinical course and {{to compare the}} effectiveness of physiotherapeutic treatment performed daily or once a week in newborns and infants with <b>congenital</b> <b>torticollis.</b> METHODS: 47 patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>torticollis</b> were assisted at the Physiotherapy and Pediatric Surgery Services of the Clinical Hospital of Campinas University. The following data were retrospectively collected: maternal and neonatal history, clinical presentation and physiotherapeutic treatment classified according to {{the frequency of the}} exercises. Intensive treatment was defined as sessions performed at the daycare clinic by the physiotherapist plus daily sessions performed by parents at home. Minimal treatment was defined as weekly sessions performed only by the physiotherapist at the daycare clinic, without participation of the parents. RESULTS: The demographic characteristics of the studied patients were: mean maternal age= 26 years; first gestation= 35 (75 %); vaginal delivery= 40 (85 %); mean age at diagnosis = 50 days. A sternomastoid nodule was felt seen in 46 (98 %) patients. Diseases associated with <b>congenital</b> <b>torticollis</b> were: congenital hip dislocation= 4 (8 %); fracture of clavicles= 2 (4 %); and club feet= 1 (2 %). Intensive treatment was performed in 34 (72 %) patients for an average of 74 days and the cure was achieved in 100 %. Minimal treatment was performed in 13 (28 %) for an average of 130 days and ten (77 %) patients achieved cure. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Congenital</b> <b>torticollis</b> had favorable outcome in both groups.

40|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>torticollis</b> is dystonic {{twisting}} of {{the neck}} by a sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle lesion. 1 The SCM tilts the ear toward the ipsilateral (same side) shoulder and turns the face toward the opposite shoulder.

40|$|Purpose. We {{describe}} {{a case of}} 3 -year-old girl with rhombencephalosynapsis, a rare cerebellar anomaly. Patient. A 3 -year-old girl was admitted to our hospital due to <b>congenital</b> <b>torticollis</b> and asymmetry of face, skull and trunk. Craniosynostosis was suspected due to abnormal head shape. 3 D-CT revealed closure of the sagittal suture without scaphocephalic skull. Due to atypical craniosynostosis with neurological symptoms, brain-MRI was performed revealing rhombencephalosynapsis. Results. Our patient presented with atypical craniosynostosis and balance problems, not typical for scaphocephaly. Operative treatment for craniosynotosis was not carried out because {{the cause of the}} problems was the cerebellum instead of the brain. Conclusions. Therefore, we conclude that patients with atypical craniosynostosis should be examined with brain-MRI to exclude the intracranial malformations, which 3 D-CT does not reveal. Without brain-MRI, decision (not) to perform surgery could have been different. Copyright © 2009 Virve Koljonen et al.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{a review of the}} {{important}} literature on the subject of congenital torti-collis. This review was made as the first part of an experimental investigation into the causes of <b>congenital</b> <b>torticollis.</b> Congenital muscular torticollis is a distinct entity, the primary pathological charac-teristics of which are limited to the sternocleidomastoideus muscle 15 The term torticollis is derived from the Latin words tortus, meaning “ twisted, ” and collum, meaning “ neck. ” Torticollis {{may be the result of}} irregular contraction of the muscles and has been described in Webster’s unabridged dictionary as twisting of the neck combined with an unnatural position of the head. Synonyms sometimes used include wry-neck, stiff-neck, caput obsti-pum, crooked-neck, and twisted-neck. There are many types of torticollis, both congenital and acquired. The most common congenital types include those resulting from muscular, osseous, or neurogenic factors, while the commoner acquired types are those resulting from infectious, neoplastic, trau-matic, hysterical, or paralytic factors. Only the muscular type of torticollis, congenital in origin, will be considered here...|$|E
40|$|Torticollis {{can arise}} from nonocular (usually musculoskeletal) and ocular conditions. Some facial asymmetries are {{correlated}} {{with a history}} of early onset ocular torticollis supported by the presence of torticollis on reviewing childhood photographs. When present in an adult, this type of facial asymmetry with an origin of ocular torticollis should help to confirm the chronicity of the defect and prevent unnecessary neurologic evaluation in patients with an uncertain history. Assessment of facial asymmetry consists of a patient history, physical examination, and medical imaging. Medical imaging and facial morphometry are helpful for objective diagnosis and measurement of the facial asymmetry, as well as for treatment planning. The facial asymmetry in congenital superior oblique palsy is typically manifested by midfacial hemihypoplasia on the side opposite the palsied muscle, with deviation of the nose and mouth toward the hypoplastic side. Correcting torticollis through strabismus surgery before a critical developmental age may prevent the development of irreversible facial asymmetry. Mild facial asymmetry associated with <b>congenital</b> <b>torticollis</b> has been reported to resolve with continued growth after early surgery, but if asymmetry is severe or is not treated in the appropriate time, it might remain even with continued growth after surgery...|$|E

30|$|Most authors cite two {{probable}} {{classes of}} causative factor in DDH. One set, alluded to above, comes under ‘packaging’ disorders with late gestational age, high birth weight, high-tone primiparous womb, and abnormal positioning belonging to this theory. Congenital talipes equinovarus and <b>congenital</b> muscular <b>torticollis</b> {{are thought to}} draw their association with DDH from {{the same set of}} causes [19, 20]. An increased risk from vaginal delivery compared to caesarean section may imply a potential for exacerbation of latent instability during a tight and traumatic passage of a breech baby through the birth canal. The other major factors in aetiology are probably heritable—ligamentous laxity, and a shallow acetabulum.|$|R
