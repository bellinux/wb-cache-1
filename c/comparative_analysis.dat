5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no <b>comparative</b> <b>analysis</b> has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School is a 1986 {{book written}} by Alan Peshkin and {{published}} by the University of Chicago Press. It {{is the product of}} his late 1970s 18-month ethnographic study of a 350-person Christian fundamentalist Baptist school in Illinois. He describes the K–12 day school's function as a total institution that educates about a singular truth (God's will) and subordination before God. The final chapter is a <b>comparative</b> <b>analysis</b> of the school and other schools, institutions, and social movements, wherein Peshkin concludes that the school is divisive in American society for promoting intolerance towards religious plurality, the very condition that permits the school's existence.|$|E

A crucial point for the application of <b>comparative</b> risk <b>analysis</b> on a national scale is the development of a unique standard procedure that should include all the regional experiences, giving them a large-scale validity with the introduction of scores tested on site-specific characteristics. In this perspective, the paper presents a critical overview of the most relevant and recent Italian experiences on <b>comparative</b> risk <b>analysis...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article, for a {{symposium}} of the Wisconsin Law Review on Professor Neil Komesar’s work on <b>comparative</b> institutional <b>analysis</b> assesses his framework {{from a new}} legal realist perspective. Komesar powerfully shows how the pursuit of any substantive goal is mediated through different institutional processes that will affect outcomes, so that institutional analysis is required. Moreover, since all institutional processes are imperfect, whether the imperfections are in the market, the political process, or the courts, such institutional <b>analysis</b> must be <b>comparative.</b> This article’s core claim is that <b>comparative</b> institutional <b>analysis</b> is empty without a new legal realist assessment of how real-life institutions operate in particular contexts, and that new legal realism is of no practical use without an analytic framework in which to translate and organize its findings for purposes of real-life decision making. <b>Comparative</b> institutional <b>analysis</b> and new legal realism are thus complementary components of any policy-relevant analysis of law. Part I presents Komesar’s comparative institutional analytic framework. Part II compares it with other forms of <b>comparative</b> institutional <b>analysis</b> used in the social sciences. Part III examines the challenge of applying <b>comparative</b> institutional <b>analysis,</b> which can be critiqued (by some) for being too narrow in its neoclassical law-and-economics focus on incentives, and (by others) for being too unwieldy {{on account of the}} variables at play. Part IV discusses why a new legal realism grounded in both empirics and a subtle understanding of law’s normativity in different institutional settings needs to complement <b>comparative</b> institutional <b>analysis.</b> Part V presents a brief example of the application of new legal realist empirics and <b>comparative</b> institutional <b>analysis</b> in the international context...|$|R
