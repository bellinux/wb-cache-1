5|$|James Master (d 1689). His {{memorial}} is a <b>cartouche</b> of marble.|$|E
5|$|The {{artifact}} shows {{a number}} of idiosyncrasies that raise questions concerning its authenticity. The numbering systems used in the codex conflict. The Maya bar-and-dot system is used to mark units, but the central Mexican dot system is used to mark multiples of twenty (for example by using 11 dots instead of 2 bars and a dot, as {{would be the case}} in the bar-and-dot system where a bar indicates 5 and a dot indicates 1). Some bar-and-dot numbers are placed within a <b>cartouche</b> decorated with a knot at the top. The only other instance of such a <b>cartouche</b> being used with numbers is in the Dresden Codex, where the <b>cartouche</b> has a very specific function, indicating a negative date count from the zero year of the great cycle of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar (roughly equivalent to the function of BC in the Gregorian calendar). In the Grolier Codex, where the numbers mark intervals between stations of Venus, the use of this <b>cartouche</b> appears meaningless, although it is suggested that it means that the codex may be read both from the front and from the back.|$|E
5|$|The shield is {{the normal}} device for {{displaying}} {{a coat of}} arms. Clergy have used less-military shapes such as the oval <b>cartouche,</b> but the shield {{has always been a}} clerical option. Clergy in Italy often use a shield shaped like a horse's face-armor. Clergy in South Africa sometimes follow the national style using a Nguni shield. Women traditionally display their coats of arms on a diamond-shaped lozenge; abbesses follow this tradition or use the <b>cartouche.</b>|$|E
5|$|Monumental {{attestations}} of Menkauhor {{are limited}} to a rock inscription at the Wadi Maghareh in Sinai, showing his titulary and a rough stele inscribed with his <b>cartouche</b> from Mastaba 904 at Saqqara.|$|E
5|$|Two large tomb stelae made {{of granite}} {{were found at}} his burial site. Their shape is unusual and they appear {{unfinished}} and rough. Egyptologists suspect that this was done deliberately, but the reasons are unknown. A cylinder seal of unknown provenance shows Peribsen's name inside a <b>cartouche</b> and gives the epithet Merj-netjeru ("beloved of the gods"). This arrangement leads Egyptologists and archaeologists {{to the conclusion that}} the seal must have been created later, in memoriam, because the use of royal cartouches began long after Peribsen's reign. Another seal of the same material shows Peribsen's name without a <b>cartouche,</b> but with the royal title Nisut-Bity ("king of Lower- and Upper Egypt") instead.|$|E
5|$|A gold {{cylinder}} seal bearing Menkauhor's <b>cartouche</b> {{as part of}} the name of his pyramid together with the serekh of Djedkare Isesi is now on display at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The seal, purportedly discovered near the Pactolus river valley in western Anatolia, could attest to wide ranging trade-contacts during the Fifth Dynasty, but its provenance remains unverifiable.|$|E
5|$|South of Egypt, a stele bearing Sahure's {{name was}} {{discovered}} in the diorite quarries located in the desert north-west of Abu Simbel in Lower Nubia. Even further south, Sahure's <b>cartouche</b> {{has been found in}} a graffiti in Tumas and on seal impressions from Buhen at the second cataract of the Nile.|$|E
5|$|Egypt entertained {{continuing}} {{trade relations}} with the Levant during Djedkare's reign, possibly {{as far north as}} Anatolia. A gold cylinder seal bearing the serekh of Djedkare Isesi together with the <b>cartouche</b> of Menkauhor Kaiu is now on display at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The seal, whose gold may originate from the Pactolus river valley in western Anatolia, could attest to wide-ranging trade-contacts during the later Fifth Dynasty, but its provenance remains unverifiable.|$|E
5|$|Stela 74 is a {{fragment}} of Olmec-style sculpture that {{was found in the}} Middle Preclassic fill of Structure 7, where it was placed when that structure replaced the Pink Structure. It bears a foliated maize design topped with a U-symbol within a <b>cartouche</b> and has other, smaller, U-symbols at its base. It is very similar to a design found on Monument 25/26 from La Venta.|$|E
5|$|The east face of {{the eastern}} wing has four bays with canted bay windows, shaped end gables and a central <b>cartouche.</b> In {{the centre of the}} {{northern}} (garden) face is a large bow window, originally Jacobean, which illuminates the chapel; it has stone panels decorated with cartouches below arched stained glass lights. This face otherwise reverses the main façade, with the addition of mezzanine windows.|$|E
5|$|Excavations at {{the pyramid}} of Sahure in Abusir under the {{direction}} of Miroslav Verner and Tarek El-Awady in the early 2000s provide a picture of the royal family of the early 5th Dynasty. In particular, reliefs from the causeway linking the valley and mortuary temples of the pyramid complex reveal that Sahure's mother was queen Neferhetepes II. She was the wife of pharaoh Userkaf, as indicated by the location of her pyramid immediately adjacent to that of Userkaf, which makes Userkaf the father of Sahure in all likelihood. This is further confirmed by the discovery of Sahure's <b>cartouche</b> in the mortuary temple of Userkaf at Saqqara, indicating that Sahure finished the structure started most probably by his father.|$|E
5|$|Scholars face several {{problems}} {{in attempting to}} connect Khaba to royal names known from the Ramesside era (the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties). Unfortunately, these lists offer no clear consensus about the number or names of the kings of the 3rd dynasty. The Abydos king list gives Nebka, Djoser, Teti, Sedjes, and Neferkarê, while the Turin Canon offers Nebka, Djoser, Djoserteti, Hudjefa, and Huni. The kinglist of Saqqara lists Djoser, Djoserteti, Nebkarê, and Huni. The ancient historian Manetho gives nine names: Necheróphes, Tosorthrós, Týreis, Mesôchris, Sôÿphis, Tósertasis, Achês, Sêphuris, and Kerpherês. Egyptologist Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards, for example, identifies Khaba with the Ramesside <b>cartouche</b> name Teti.|$|E
5|$|A {{minority}} of modern Egyptologists think that Khaba might be identical to a Ramesside <b>cartouche</b> name known as Huni. This name can be credited to a king who is handed {{down by the}} Ramesside scribes as the last ruler of the 3rd dynasty. Rainer Stadelmann, Nicolas Grimal, Wolfgang Helck, and Toby Wilkinson point to a step pyramid at Zawyet el'Aryan, called the Layer Pyramid. This monument is assigned to Khaba (see section below) and since Stadelmann and Wilkinson hold that the pyramid was finished, they believe that a long-reigning king, such as king Huni, would have been necessary to oversee the project. Huni is attested in the Turin Canon to have reigned for 24 years. In addition, Stadelmann points to the seal impressions found at Elephantine: they come from a site very close to a stepped pyramid which {{is said to have}} been built by Huni.|$|E
5|$|Although {{having the}} same floor plan, the House and Senate {{chambers}} are decorated very differently, with the former in terra cotta and teal colors and the latter in blue and gold. An oval <b>cartouche</b> in the carpet {{at the entrance to}} the House chamber features the state flower, the apple blossom. Presiding over the house is the speaker, whose chair is behind a desk in the center with a plaster and paint version of the state coat of arms. The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House. The president of the Senate is the lieutenant governor, who presides over sessions from a walnut rostrum at the front of the chamber. Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room. These ceiling tiles feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The south (front) face of {{the eastern}} wing has seven bays, with a balustraded parapet at eaves level. The central bay is set forward to form a stone centrepiece around the arched main {{entrance}}, which is flanked by fluted Ionic columns. Immediately above the entrance are doubled tapering pilasters flanking a three-light window, all surmounted by a large <b>cartouche</b> decorated with strapwork. On {{the first floor of}} the central bay is a triple-mullion window, and above the parapet is a coat of arms. Flanking the centrepiece are two bays with diapered brickwork and single-mullion windows. The two ends of the south face are also set forward; they have canted, triple-mullion bay windows and are surmounted above the parapet by shaped gables with attic windows. All the main windows of this face are double transomed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, Egypt {{had entered}} a long period of {{political}} and economic decline. The priests at Thebes grew more powerful, and they effectively administered Upper Egypt, while kings ruling from Tanis controlled Lower Egypt. Some attempt at using the open tombs was made {{at the start of the}} Twenty-first Dynasty, with the High Priest of Amun, Pinedjem I, adding his <b>cartouche</b> to KV4. The Valley began to be heavily plundered, so during the Twenty-first Dynasty the priests of Amun opened most of the tombs and moved the mummies into three tombs in order to better protect them. They removed most of the treasure in order to further protect the bodies from robbers. Most of these were later moved to a single cache near Deir el-Bari (known as TT320). Located in the cliffs overlooking Hatshepsut's famous temple, this mass reburial contained a large number of royal mummies. They were found in a great state of disorder, many placed in other's coffins, and several are still unidentified. Other mummies were moved to the tomb of Amenhotep II, where over a dozen mummies, many of them royal, were later relocated.|$|E
5|$|Scholars such as Herman TeVelde, I. E. S. Edwards and Toby Wilkinson {{believe the}} {{inscription}} {{of the famous}} Annal stone of Fifth dynasty, a black olivin-basalt slabstone displaying a very detailed king list, argues against {{the division of the}} realm. On the stone the kings from 1st to 7th dynasty are listed by their Horus name, their gold name and their <b>cartouche</b> name, their name banderoles end with the name of their royal mother. The lists also contain rectangular windows presenting year events from the day of king's coronation up to his death. The most famous fragments of the Annal stone are called Palermo Stone and Cairo Stone. On the Cairo stone, in line IV, the nine last years of king Nynetjer are preserved (but most of the year windows are illegible now). The date of Nynetjer's death is followed by a new king. Recent investigations reveal that the serekh of that new king is surmounted by a four-legged animal, not by the Horus-falcon. Since the only four-legged heraldic serekh animal in early Egypt was the chimera of the god Seth, despite passionate disagreement, the indicated ruler is likely to be Peribsen. Egyptologists such as TeVelde, Barta and Edwards do not agree; Peribsen might have not been the only king with a Seth-name. The year events under Nynetjer show increasing references to Seth, suggesting the tradition of a Horus name as the sole name of kings might have already evolved. The rise of a king allied with Seth was thus unsurprising. TeVelde, Barta and Edwards think that, in addition to Peribsen, the rulers Wadjenes, Nubnefer or Sened might have been Seth-kings as well; one of them surely was the true direct successor of Nynetjer. The comparatively large amount of archaeological finds from Peribsen's reign contradict the brief estimated length of rulership, only 10 to 12 years, as presented on the Annal stone.|$|E
25|$|Above the {{inscription}} was carved the <b>cartouche</b> of Osorkon II {{and the following}} text.|$|E
25|$|Similar to the Nebty name, this {{particular}} name typically was not {{framed by a}} <b>cartouche</b> or serekh.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle Kingdom, {{the full}} titulary was {{sometimes}} {{written in a}} single <b>cartouche,</b> as in this example from Senusret I, from Beni Hasan.|$|E
25|$|The pharaoh's throne name, {{the first}} of the two names written inside a <b>cartouche,</b> and usually {{accompanied}} the title nsw-bity (nesu-bity, nesw-bit, nswt-bjtj).|$|E
25|$|The older version {{uses the}} hieroglyphic signs candle wick (Gardiner sign V28), juncus sprout (Gardiner sign M23), bread loaf (Gardiner sign X1) and water line (Gardiner sign N35). This writing form {{can be found}} on Old Kingdom objects such as the Palermo Stone recto (reign of Neferirkare), the tomb {{inscription}} of Metjen, the stone vessel found in Abusir and the granite cone from Elephantine. Whilst the stone vessel from Abusir writes Huni's name without a <b>cartouche,</b> but gives the Niswt-Bity-title, all other Old Kingdom writings place the king's name inside an oval <b>cartouche.</b>|$|E
25|$|Omm Sety {{observed}} that the Tree of Extremity, mentioned in the Quran with inscribed leaves, compares with ancient Egyptian Temple scenes in which a god is shown inscribing the royal <b>cartouche</b> on leaves adorning The Tree of Life.|$|E
25|$|Emlen Physick House (1878), Cape May, New Jersey. Furness {{designed}} (and Pabst likely made) {{the interior}} woodwork, and 2 bedroom suites original to the house. The <b>cartouche</b> on one bed's headboard is repeated in a stained glass window.|$|E
25|$|Aidan Dodson cites this stele {{to support}} the idea that Nefertiti may have acted at one point as someone with the status of a coregent as {{indicated}} by the crown, but not entitled to full pharoanic honors such as the double <b>cartouche.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{reading and}} {{translation}} of his <b>cartouche</b> name is also disputed. In general, two basic versions {{of his name}} exist: an old version, which is closest to the (lost) original, and a younger version, {{which seems to be}} based on ramesside interpretations and misreadings.|$|E
25|$|The Egyptologist Thomas Young, {{finding the}} Khaf hieroglyphs in a damaged <b>cartouche</b> used to {{surround}} a royal name, inserted the glyph ra to complete Khafra's name. When the Stele was re-excavated in 1925, {{the lines of}} text referring to Khaf flaked off and were destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Henry Nettleton was the U.S. Principal Sub-inspector in 1878 at the Springfield Armory. Second {{only to the}} OWA Colts, Nettleton Colts are prized by serious collectors. Both the Nettleton and OWA Colts {{have the}} <b>cartouche</b> (OWA or HN) {{on the left side}} of the wood grip.|$|E
25|$|Reeves {{sees this}} as an {{important}} item in the case for Nefertiti. When the stele was started, she was queen and thus portrayed with the flat top headpiece. She was elevated to coregent shortly afterwards and a fourth <b>cartouche</b> was squeezed in to accommodate two kings.|$|E
25|$|The archaeological {{evidence}} relates {{to a woman}} who reigned as pharaoh {{toward the end of the}} Amarna Period during the Eighteenth Dynasty. Her gender is confirmed by feminine traces occasionally found in the name and by the epithet Akhet-en-hyes ("Effective for her husband"), incorporated into one version of her second <b>cartouche.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} -although worn in {{many places}} of its facade- shows a nice decoration on the first floor, with pediments topping windows and ornamented <b>cartouche</b> beneath, {{as well as a}} row of round openings below the roof. The main feature is the grand two-floor stretched bay window standing on streets corner.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the name seals listed above, Kunimasu used three symbol seals: a bat-shaped seal, the symbol 寿 , and the toshidama-in <b>cartouche.</b> The latter distinctive mark was reserved {{for members of the}} Utagawa school of print designers. Examples of other seals applied to Kunimasu's prints exist, but are indecipherable.|$|E
25|$|The {{placement}} of the actor/ character name <b>cartouche</b> near the left upper edge, indicates that this image is the left-most and third in the series. The two other images are Nakamura Utaemon III as Ōuchi Saemon Hidemaru by Shunshosai Hokuchō (centre), and Seki Sanjūrō II as Ishizuka Jinzaburō by Shunyōsai Shunshi (right).|$|E
25|$|The facade on Dworcowa street {{shed light}} on the fact that {{initially}} the tenement has been designed as two different houses, N°15 & 15a. There is clearly a divide between the left part bending on Neo-Renaissance style (symmetry, naked walls, flat roof) and the right one inclining on eclecticist diversity (balconies, bossage wall, <b>cartouche</b> decoration, mansard roof).|$|E
25|$|In 1982-1983, {{the church}} remains were restored. During this restoration, a gate from the sacristy {{was placed on}} the inner wall of the choir. In addition, a <b>cartouche</b> with the text En Salicht Leiden ("and bless Leiden"), {{originally}} from Leiden's town hall (which was destroyed by fire in 1929), was placed into the eastern outer wall.|$|E
25|$|Commerce series: Later notes had a {{vignette}} representing an allegorical {{female figure}} personifying 'commerce'. The notes were printed on both sides. On the obverse {{the name of}} the bank and the denominations were printed in three scripts, viz., (Urdu, Bengali and Devanagari). On the reverse of such notes was printed a <b>cartouche</b> with ornamentation carrying {{the name of the}} Bank.|$|E
