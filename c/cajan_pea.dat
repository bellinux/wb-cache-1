40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effects of preceding crops and tillage systems on the incidence of Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) yield. The cultivar BRS Valente was cultivated under center&# 8209;pivot irrigation in the winter seasons of 2003, 2004 and 2005, after several preceding crops established in the summer seasons. Preceding crops included the legumes Cajanus <b>cajan</b> (pigeon <b>pea),</b> Stylosanthes guianensis, and Crotalaria spectabilis; the grasses Pennisetum glaucum (millet), Sorghum bicolor (forage sorghum), Panicum maximum, and Urochloa brizantha; and a consortium of maize (Zea mays) and U. brizantha (Santa Fé system). Experiments followed a strip&# 8209;plot design, with four replicates. Fusarium wilt incidence was higher in the no&# 8209;tillage system. Higher disease incidences corresponded to lower bean yields in 2003 and 2004. Previous summer cropping with U. brizantha, U. brizantha + maize consortium, and millet showed the lowest disease incidence. Therefore, the choice of preceding crops {{must be taken into}} account for managing Fusarium wilt on irrigated common bean crops in the Brazilian Cerrado...|$|R
40|$|An 11. 76 -kilobase-pair (kb) {{segment of}} DNA from Bradyrhizobium sp. (Vigna) strain IRc 78 that hybridizes to {{nodulation}} genes of Rhizobium meliloti strain 41 was isolated. Hybridization of the 11. 76 -kb DNA fragment to DNA from other Bradyrhizobium species revealed {{a high degree}} of sequence conservation in this region. Transfer of the 11. 76 -kb segment to nodulation-defective (Nod-) mutants of R. meliloti restored their ability to induce nodules on Medicago sativa (alfalfa). Mutants of strain IRc 78 generated by Tn 5 mutagenesis of the 11. 76 -kb segment fell into three classes according to their symbiotic reaction with Vigna unguiculata (cowpea). Class I mutants of strain IRc 78 were unable to induce root-hair curling or to nodulate; class II induced small, ineffective nodules; and class III showed delayed and decreased nodulation with reduction in amount of nitrogen fixed. Furthermore, in contrast to the wild-type strain, class I mutants could not induce nodules on Glycine max (soybean), Cajanus <b>cajan</b> (pigeon <b>pea),</b> or Arachis hypogaea (peanut). This finding suggests a common function of the 11. 76 -kb region in the infection of host plants by Bradyrhizobium either through root hairs or by “crack entry. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} a formulation from the milky mangrove tree Excoecaria agallocha L. (E. agallocha) against Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (H. armigera). MethodsAbout 3 % aqueous ethanolic spray formulation {{derived from the}} lipophilic extract of E. agallocha (dry leaf) was evaluated against H. armigera in Abelmoschus esculentus (lady's finger) and Cajanus cajan (C. <b>cajan)</b> (pigeon <b>pea),</b> under field conditions. ResultsOn the 9 th day of the 4 th spray the larval count in the plot treated with 3 % E. agallocha formulation drastically came down to 0. 23 larva/plant, compared to 1. 63 in the ethanol control plot and 1. 60 in the unsprayed plot. Blocks sprayed with 3 % E. agallocha formulation yielded 35. 8 quintals/hectare (q/ha) of healthy pods compared to Ekalux® (pod yield: 60. 7 q/ha), 3 % Vijay Neem® (60. 22 q/ha), yield plot (6 q/ha) and ethanol control (7 q/ha). In C. cajan, 1 % E. agallocha, 3 % Nimbecidine® and 0. 07 % indoxacarb were equally potent in reducing the larval population of H. armigera and the non-target pest Spilosoma obliqua to 0 %, from the 9 th day (3 rd spray). Indoxacarb plot recorded the maximum yield of 16. 1 q/ha with 2. 4 % pod damage. Plots sprayed with 1 % E. agallocha yielded 14. 7 q/ha with 2. 32 % pod damage. The effect of 3 % Nimbecidine® spray (14. 35 q/ha) was comparable to E. agallocha formulation. Unsprayed and ethanol control plots yielded 12. 41 and 11. 2 q/ha of pods with an average pod damage of 4. 7 %.

40|$|Abstract: Somatic {{embryogenesis}} was induced from mature cotyledon explants of two {{pigeon pea}} genotypes cultured on MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of 2, 4 -D and Thiadizuron (TDZ). The greatest response was obtained with 2. 0 mg/l (2, 4 -D) or (TDZ). Type and concentrations of growth regulators along with genotypes influenced {{the frequency of}} somatic embryogenesis. TDZ was more superior than 2, 4 -D at 2. 0 mg/l increasing number of somatic embryos/explant with ICPL 87 - 118 genotype and produced the highest number (29. 40), while no significant deference between 2. 0 mg/l of either TDZ or 2, 4 -D in increasing this parameter with ICPL 151 (20. 0 and 21. 20) respectively. Maturation treatment increased normal germinated somatic embryos significantly (1. 95) compared with somatic embryos that had no maturation treatment (0. 40). Half MS salts basal medium was better than full MS medium in germinating of pigeon pea somatic embryos. The number of converted embryos increased significantly from 0. 75 to 1. 60 when 0. 1 mg/l BA was supplemented to the media. No secondary embryogenesis was induced on somatic embryos that cultured on maturation medium. However, without maturation treatment, more than 70 % of secondary embryogenesis was obtained with full strength basal medium MS supplemented with 0. 1 mg/l BA. After one month from acclimatization the plantlets grew vigorously and a percentage of plant survival (32 %) was achieved during this phase of culture. The present study aimed to produce embryos with high frequency and their subsequent conversion to plants offers potential to use in plant transformation and regeneration and to produce synthetic seeds.

40|$|The University of Hohenheim in West Germany {{has set up}} a {{regional}} research programme which will produce and improve agricultural production technologies targeted on small-scale farmers in West Africa. Work is now underway at various collaborating centres, including ICRISAT'S's Sahelian Centre in Niger, at the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture's headquarters in Nigeria and at the Institute's regional research station in Benin. Current projects are evaluating the physiological and agronomic bases of alleycropping systems in terms of stabilizing food crop yields. Particular attention is being paid to methods of stabilizing yields of cassava and maize under conditions where crop rotations and fallow periods can no longer be operated. Work has concentrated on two improved varieties, cassava TMS 30572 and maize TZESRW. Alley cropping generally helps to conserve soil moisture, reduce water stress, and improve soil fertility by returning minerals and organic matter to the soil. Competition from weeds also tends to be reduced. Intercropping trials with Leucaena lecuocephala and Cajanas <b>cajan</b> (pigeon <b>pea),</b> both leguminous, soil-enriching plants, have produced mixed results. On the poor, acidic, red oxisols of the field trials site, leucaena showed poor initial growth and rapid signs of nutrient deficiency, whereas, under the same conditions, pigeon pea exhibited healthy growth and a rapid build-up of dry matter. Both intercropping regimes resulted in increased yields, and it is hoped to extend the trials to different ecological zones using different farming systems.

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} the in situ degradation of dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and crude protein (CP) in roughages by the in situ caecal digestion technique in horses. The roughages evaluated were: Lucerne hay (Medicago sativa), peanut (Arachis pintoi cv. Amarillo), desmodio(Desmodium ovalifolium), stylo (Stylosanthes guianensis cv. Mineirão), pigeon <b>pea</b> (Cajanus <b>cajan),</b> lime-yellow <b>pea</b> (Macrotyloma axillare) and coastcross hay (Cynodon dactylon cv. coastcross). The assay was conducted in a complete randomized design with seven roughages and three replications. One mare with a cannula fitted in the caecum was used, fed diet consisting of coastcross hay (80 %) and concentrate (20 %) at 2. 0 % BW, four times a day. Nylon 6. 5 × 20 cm bags were used with 45 &# 956;/pore, containing 5. 2 g DM/bag, inserting 3 or 4 bags in the caecum at the times of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours incubation. The caecum in situ degradability parameters of nutrients were obtained by Ørskov model. The DM degradability parameters of all the roughages were significant. There was no fit to the model for pigeon pea for CP and NDF and desmodio. Peanut, stylo and lime-yellow pea presented larger potentially degradable DM with values of 53, 46. 5 and 40 %, respectively, and higher values for the soluble fraction of 20, 21, 28. 6 %, with high degradability rates of 10. 36, 20. 26 and 14. 8 % h- 1. Higher NDF degradation rates were observed in these foodstuffs with values of 9. 1 and 11. 3, 11. 2 % h- 1, high potentially degradable fraction with values of 55, 51. 8 and 47. 2 %, and greater CP degradation at 48 hours with values of 87, 95, and 94. 8 %.

In no-choice experiments, the number of eggs layed in sunflower, C. juncea and soybean was larger compared to cotton. Despite {{the fact that the}} adults did not discriminate among plants, in dual-choice test, the proportion of eggs layed and leaf consumption by P. cuyabana adults in soybean were significantly higher than in C. spectabilis. The larval distribution in the soil was at random in multiple-choice, withouth any trend of preference, but in dual-choice, when soybean was the control, larvae always preferred to feed on its roots. P. cuyabana adults had preference for more suitable hosts and that could stand their offspring survival.

40|$|Christmas Island {{has been}} mined for rock {{phosphate}} for over 100 years, and as mining will {{finish in the}} next few decades {{there is a need to}} develop alternative economies on the island, such as high value crop production. However, to conserve the unique flora and fauna on the island, only land previously mined will be considered for this purpose. As these soils have been severely perturbed by mining, strategies to improve soil quality parameters need to be undertaken before plant based industries can be considered. For instance, legumes and beneficial microbes have demonstrated a positive role in the remediation of degraded soils. Therefore, this study aimed to establish the scientific basis upon which agriculture can effectively be developed on s oils post phosphate mining. Six legume species (Glycine max (Soybean), Vigna radiata (Mungbean), V. unguiculata (Cowpea), Phaseolus vulgaris (Navybean), Cajanus <b>cajan</b> (Pigeon <b>pea),</b> and Lablab purpureus (Lablab)) were sown onto a two ha rehabilitated site t hat had previously been mined for rock phosphate. The soil had a pH of 7. 0, and was high in P but low in Bo, Cu, K, Mg, N and S and had low organic C. The legumes were inoculated with their respective rhizobial inoculant or co-inoculated with the rhizobia and a plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) at three different fertilizer rates (nil, a low rate, and five times the low rate). With the exception of P. vulgaris, all the legume species survived. The application of fertilizer was essential for maximum biomass yields 18 weeks after sowing, however the lower fertilizer rate was sufficient to obtain maximum yields for some cultivars. The PGPB increased yields and nodulation of some of the legumes at different fertilizer levels. Although the legumes (except P. vulgaris) grew in the Christmas Island environment, selection of appropriate legume cultivars and inoculants plus optimization of the fertilizer regime is required for reliable agricultural productivity on the island...|$|R

Frequent attacks by pathogens, insect pests, and nematodes cause impairments to the plants at various stages of crop growth. The average annual loss in legumes due to pests and pathogens was estimated to be up to 20 % (Dhaliwal et al., 2010). In other words, the efforts dedicated to protect the crop may witness substantial increment in food legume production. Up to 100 % losses have been reported in various legume crops in Asia and Africa in case of the conditions that favor diseases and pests (Vijay et al., 2015). In India, a considerable extent of yield in pigeon pea and chickpea is lost due to pod borer [Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner)]. In pigeon pea, spotted pod borer [Maruca vitrata (Fabricius)] remains the second most important pest causing up to 84 % reduction in crop yield, amounting to a loss of nearly US$ 30 million in monitory terms (Margam et al., 2011). Similarly, more than 40 % damage to the pods in pigeon pea is caused by pod fly [Melanagromyza obtusa (Malloch)] (Singh et al., 2013). The other pathogens that plague legume production include wilt, dry root rot, Phytophthora blight, collar rot, stem/white rot, Macrophomina blight, and yellow vein mosaic virus (YVMV). Losses caused by wilt in legumes may vary from 0 to 100 % depending on the crop stage (Pande et al., 2013).|$|R
