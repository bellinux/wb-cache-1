40|$|INTRODUCTION: The general {{practitioner}} (GP) plays {{a very important}} role in early detection of alcoholism. Clinical evaluation is often the only method used, although {{it has been suggested that}} any systematic patient history should include the <b>CAGE</b> <b>test.</b> We compare the effectiveness of these two approaches and attempt to determine the applicability of the <b>CAGE</b> <b>test</b> in a {{general practitioner}}'s usual practice. METHOD: 12 GPs took part in this study during 6 months. They looked for possible alcohol abuse in each new patient by a standard patient history and clinical examination. Patients were randomized into 2 groups, one of which was given the <b>CAGE</b> <b>test</b> and the other not. For each patient in the CAGE group the applicability of the test was quantified by the GP. RESULTS: 416 patients were included; 214 were randomized into the "CAGE group" and 202 into the control group. On a clinical basis, 15 patients in the control group and 16 in the "CAGE group" (14 men, 2 women) were suspected of alcohol abuse. The <b>CAGE</b> <b>test</b> was positive in 15 patients (7 %); among these, 6 were not suspect on a clinical basis. In patients aged 18 - 34, the detection rate of alcohol-related problems more than doubled when the <b>CAGE</b> <b>test</b> was used. The age of the patients influenced performance of the <b>CAGE</b> <b>test</b> and clinical evaluation. Only 2 % of women had a positive <b>CAGE</b> <b>test.</b> Administration of the <b>CAGE</b> <b>test</b> was considered easy in 112 patients and average to difficult in 50, while the test was inapplicable with 52 patients. The latter proportion was higher than that observed in institutions (hospitals, outpatient departments) of the same region. Applicability was influenced neither by the sex nor the age of the patients, but varied greatly according to the physician (from 38 % to 100 %). CONCLUSION: The <b>CAGE</b> <b>test</b> increases the number of patients detected with alcohol problems by 37 % and seems to be especially useful when administered to young people. The number of women with alcohol problems is probably underestimated by both clinical evaluation and the <b>CAGE</b> <b>test.</b> Furthermore, physicians in private practice are more reluctant to use the <b>CAGE</b> <b>test</b> systematically than those in a public institution...|$|E
30|$|The {{efficacy}} of the mosquito repellents can be evaluated using a standard methods according to World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO 1996), and American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) (Standards 2006).

40|$|Reporting Period: The results {{reported}} here are from work conducted October 2005 to September 2006. Two California isolates and a Texas isolate of the entomopathogenic fungus, Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin, demonstrated their potential as effective pathogens of the glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS), Homalodisca vitripennis (formerly H. coagulata). Virulence of these isolates evaluated {{in the laboratory}} assays at different conidial concentrations and in small <b>caged</b> <b>tests</b> was similar.

40|$|Migratory birds use {{celestial}} and geomagnetic directional {{information to}} orient {{on their way}} between breeding and wintering areas. Cue-conflict experiments involving these two orientation cue systems have shown that directional information can be transferred from one system to the other by calibration. We designed experiments with four species of North American songbirds to: (1) examine whether these species calibrate orientation information from one system to the other; and (2) determine whether there are species-specific differences in calibration. Migratory orientation was recorded with two different techniques, <b>cage</b> <b>tests</b> and free-flight release rests, during autumn migration. <b>Cage</b> <b>tests</b> at dusk in the local geomagnetic field revealed species-specific differences: red-eyed vireo, Vireo olivaceus, and northern waterthrush, Seiurus noveboracensis, selected seasonally appropriate southerly directions whereas indigo bunting, Passerina cyanea, and grey catbird, Dumetella carolinensis, oriented towards the sunset direction. When tested in deflected magnetic fields, vireos and waterthrushes responded by shifting their orientation according to the deflection of the magnetic field, but buntings and catbirds failed to show any response to the treatment. In release tests, all four species showed that they had recalibrated their star compass {{on the basis of}} the magnetic field they had just experienced in the <b>cage</b> <b>tests.</b> Since release tests were done in the local geomagnetic field it seems clear that once the migratory direction is determined, most likely during the twilight period, the birds use their recalibrated star compass for orientation at departure.

40|$|Following {{advances}} in genetic engineering, mice are today {{the most commonly}} used mammal in research. This thesis addresses two issues: the impact on animal welfare and research quality by environmental enrichment and the characterization of genetically modified mice. In the first paper, the effects of environmental enrichment before weaning were studied. No alterations were found at age 4 weeks, but after 8 weeks of environmental enrichment the home cage activity had decreased. In the second paper, a battery of behavioural tests was used to characterize a spontaneous mouse mutant, the leaner heterozygous. This mutant showed cognitive and motor impairment. This finding was followed up, in the third paper, by housing the leaner heterozygous and wild type mice in cages with three different degrees of environmental complexity. In Morris watermaze tests at 6, 12 and 20 months of age, environmental enrichment was found to increase learning and memory capacity in mice of both genotypes. In paper IV, a characterization routine is presented for pre-weaning monitoring of mutant mice. Individual pups were scored for several development parameters on postnatal days 1, 3, 7 and 14. At weaning (day 19 to 21) a clinical examination and the novel <b>cage</b> <b>test</b> for emotional reactivity were carried out. The protocol was tested in several C 57 BL/ 6, BALB/C, 129 S 6 and B 6 CBAF 1 litters. The characterization routine was efficient in detecting differences between genotypes in weight gain, physical condition at weaning, reaction to handling and emotional reactivity. In paper V, C 57 BL/ 6, 129 S 6 and B 6 CBAF 1 mice were used. The mice were tested in the novel cage (at weaning), the open Field test (at 5 weeks), and from 9 weeks of age in the elevated plus-maze, the concentric square field and the rat exposure test. Results obtained with the novel <b>cage</b> <b>test</b> at weaning were largely consistent with those obtained in the established tests later in life. In conclusion, this thesis shows that cage enrichment decreases the cognitive deficits in the heterozygous leaner mouse. The new protocol for pre-weaning monitoring can be used to detect deviations in early development and emotional reactivity in a number of commonly used mice genotypes...|$|E

Ionizing radiation used to generate reproductive sterility in the mass-reared populations before release leads to reduction of competitiveness. Results Here, we present a first alternative reproductive sterility system for medfly based on transgenic embryonic lethality. This system is dependent on newly isolated medfly promoter/enhancer elements of cellularization-specifically-expressed genes. These elements act differently in expression strength {{and their ability to}} drive lethal effector gene activation. Moreover, position effects strongly influence the efficiency of the system. Out of 60 combinations of driver and effector construct integrations, several lines resulted in larval and pupal lethality with one line showing complete embryonic lethality.

Exposure with the mother behind the partition evoked more vocalizations at the oldest of three test ages, and among females, higher levels of plasma cortisol than did exposure to the <b>test</b> <b>cage</b> with the mother freely accessible. These {{results indicate that the}} deprivation of both contact-derived and distal maternal cues contribute to the vocalization response of separated guinea pig pups, and for female pups, to the plasma cortisol elevations evoked by the separation procedure...|$|R
