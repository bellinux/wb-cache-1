25|$|Doxepin is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzoxepin, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. It is the only TCA with a dibenzoxepin ring system to have been marketed. Doxepin is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite nordoxepin being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), and trimipramine. Doxepin {{is a mixture of}} (E) and (Z) stereoisomers (the latter being known as <b>cidoxepin</b> or cis-doxepin) and is used commercially in a ratio of approximately 85:15. The chemical name of doxepin is (E/Z)-3-(dibenzooxepin-11(6H)-ylidene)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H21NO with a molecular weight of 279.376g/mol. The drug is used commercially almost exclusively as the hydrochloride salt; the free base has been used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 1668-19-5 and of the hydrochloride is 1229-29-4.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cidoxepin</b> (former {{developmental}} {{code name}} P-4599), {{also known as}} cis-doxepin or (Z)-doxepin, is a tricyclic antidepressant which {{was developed in the}} 1960s but was never marketed. It is the cis or (Z) stereoisomer of doxepin, a mixture of (E) and (Z) isomers that is used commercially in a ratio of approximately 85:15 with <b>cidoxepin</b> as a relatively minor constituent. However, the drug has similar activity to that of doxepin, acting as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, H1 receptor antagonist, and anticholinergic, and notably is thought to have more antidepressant activity than trans-doxepin. The central anticholinergic activity of <b>cidoxepin</b> has been reported to be 3-fold greater than that of the trans isomer in mice.|$|E
