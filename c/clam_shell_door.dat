The front bumper covered only the corners, allowing the grill {{to be much}} more prominent than normal. The roof line terminated behind the large door on each side. Above the rear waistline were a pair of side hinged <b>clam</b> <b>shell</b> <b>doors</b> covering the entire rear section.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the postembryonic {{variability}} {{of male and female}} shells in V. viviparus Linnaeus, 1758 from two Ukrainian populations. The paper represents the investigation of variability of molluscs shells Viviparus in the post-embryonic period. The comparative-morphological study of the adventitious <b>clam</b> <b>shell</b> of the <b>clams</b> of the genus Viviparus should be conducted taking into account the age of molluscs. Our data suggest that sex dimorphism in viviparid according to the confidential parameters of adult individuals is obviously absent. It is determined that the difference in the life expectancy of males V. viviparus Linnaeus, 1758 from Bucha and Southern Bug rivers can be dictated by the direct influence of the peculiarities of the location of cluster collection points. It is established that the morphological features of the V. viviparus Linnaeus, 1758 adulatory <b>clam</b> <b>shell</b> are largely determined by the place where they live.
