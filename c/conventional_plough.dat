This study investigates measures to reduce nitrate losses from tillage land used for spring barley production to a shallow {{sand and gravel}} aquifer situated in Oak Park, Co. Carlow, south-east Ireland, in an area with high groundwater vulnerability and close proximity to a nearby river. The hydrogeological investigations and the charaterisation of aquifer under the study area were performed. Particle size analysis confirmed the sand and gravel dominated composition of these sediments. Aquifer transmissivity was estimated {{in the range from}} c. 248 - 1058 m 2 /day. A tracer study indicated that soil surface activities at this site can have an impact on shallow groundwater quality within a period of less than one year. The effects of the three over-winter green cover treatments (mustard, natural regeneration and no-cover) under two different tillage practices (<b>conventional</b> <b>plough</b> and reduced tillage) on nitrate leaching to the unsaturated zone were examined over the period of over-wintering leaching seasons during the three years.

40|$|The minimum {{possible}} soil tillage is {{an important}} part of a sustainable crop production system. Research and practice of reduced tillage was originally started mainly to reduce energy and time consumption related to tillage. However, current research and practice of reduced tillage is also aimed at soil and water conservation as well as reduction of nutrient losses from arable land. Research on reduced tillage in Sweden has been conducted for more than two decades. Reduced tillage comprises different tillage systems, which replace the traditional moldboard ploughing. These also include modem plough shares by which depth of ploughing can be reduced to about 10 cm. This report summarizes investigations of soil physical properties in six long-term experiments with reduced tillage. The experiments were 6 to 24 years old at the time of investigation (in 1997 or 1998). In this study, soil physical properties after minimum tillage and <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> were compared. Soil physical properties investigated include dry bulk density, soil water content during the vegetation period, infiltration, saturated hydraulic conductivity, water holding capacity, air permeability in the field and laboratory, oxygen content of soil air after continuous or heavy rain, and soil temperature. Soil water content during the vegetation period was measured with TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry). The dry bulk density in the lower part of the top soil was greater in plots with reduced tillage than in plots with <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Many of the investigated soil physical properties were improved by reduced tillage. Variation of soil water content was smaller for reduced tillage than for <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing.</b> This shows that drainage and water holding capacity often were improved, particularly in the heavy soils. crop yield in heavy clays has been improved by reduced tillage. In some cases, A decrease in yield was observed during the initial periods of reduced tillage, but the difference has been minimized with time, which can be attributed to the improvement of soil structure. This improvement, however, may be less pronounced in light soils. A well planned transition from <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> to reduced tillage, such as loosening of old plough pan and minimizing of infestation by perennial weeds, can minimize yield losses...|$|R
40|$|Reduced tillage {{and green}} manures may be capable to further improve organic crop {{production}} systems. However, it is presumed that under organic farming conditions a lower intensity of soil tillage may reduce nitrogen (N) availability and increase weed pressure.

In both years, in the reduced tillage systems the V. sativa treatments resulted in N levels as well as oat yields on a similar level like the best plough treatments. Yield differences between the different green manure treatments in the plough system were generally low. They were more pronounced between the green manure treatments in the reduced tillage systems.

40|$|Abstract: In Brazil?s central savanna region, {{government}} {{policy is to}} encourage the conversion of <b>conventional</b> <b>plough</b> tillage (PT) agriculture to no-till (NT) and raise the productivity of under-utilized pastures, including their conversion to integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems, {{with the objective of}} increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) at the expense of atmospheric carbon dioxide. An experiment was established in 1991 by liming and fertilizing at two levels an area of native vegetation (NV). The treatments, replicated in randomized plots, included pastures, continuous cropping and ICL systems under PT or NT. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the SOC accumulation to 100 cm depth under these treatments over time. The high C:N ratios suggested that there was a high proportion of charcoal present in the soil. Increasing fertilizer inputs had no overall significant effect on SOC stocks. Stocks of SOC changed little under pastures. Analyses of ¹³C abundance showed that higher fertilizer inputs increased the decomposition rate of C derived from NV under pure grass pastures. Continuous cropping under NT preserved SOC and under PT there were significant losses. The highest SOC stocks were found under ILP treatments, but not all ILP treatments accumulated SOC even under NT. These results indicate that government initiatives to substitute PT with NT and to intensify beef cattle production will have only modest short-term gains in SOC accumulation. 201...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in crop establishment techniques {{have led to}} the introduction of conservation tillage systems that enables a {{reduction in the number of}} field operations and associated costs whilst maintaining or increasing financial margins. A recent development in conservation tillage systems in the United States was the adoption of strip tillage that was defined as the disturbance of less than one-third of a total field by cultivation. The aim of strip tillage is to produce a narrow, residue free, cultivated zone that is suitable for drilling crops into whilst leaving a significant area uncultivated that maintains crop residue on the soil surface with benefits both to soil stability and biodiversity. This study reported in this thesis focuses on the use ofa strip tillage implement to establish Brassica napus and Beta vulgaris in two soil types found in the United Kingdom. Crop residue has been reported to reduce crop emergence and this study found a reduction in percentage emergence by up to 40 % when straw was mixed into the top 5 cm of soil or when straw and seed was placed on the soil surface. The strip tillage unit using a tine and disc combination operating in a range of light soil types gave disturbance patterns that were independent of forward speed in the range of 6. 0 to 12. 0 km/h but tine penetration was often limited. The star wheel was found to remove up to 80 % of straw residue from within row. Using strip tillage was found to create a tilth either similar to, or finer than, plough tillage but initially gave poorer emergence and growth. Overall performance of using strip tillage to establish Brassica napus and Beta vulgaris was found to be equivalent to a <b>conventional</b> <b>plough</b> tillage system resulting in no penalties to crop yield or quality.

40|$|In {{the autumn}} 2006 a project was {{started with the}} title "Soil {{structure}} for Optimal Winter Oilseed Rape". In this essay eight field trials in the southern and middle part of Sweden have been studied between the years of 2006 and 2007. Six of the field trials (R 2 - 4141 and L 2 - 4141) contained different establish methods. The establish methods that were investigated for winter oilseed rape were <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing,</b> shallow ploughing, shallow cultivation with a Carrier or a cultivator, spread sowing followed by cultivation with a Carrier or a cultivator and sub soiling. The other two field trials (R 2 - 4135 and R 2 - 4135 - 6) show how winter oilseed rape reacts on different preceding crops (spring barley, winter wheat, fallow and active fallow) and establish methods (<b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> and shallow cultivation). To investigate the soil structure and how it affects {{the development of the}} plant, different measurements were made. Some of these were seed bed analysis, water infiltration, soil penetration, plant counting and studying plant development in autumn and spring. The establishment trials were situated in different parts of Sweden, which made an overall comparison difficult. The results of the measurements varied between the trials, but were small within the trials. The differences in yield were small. There were some tendency that a reduced cultivation system resulted in a higher yield on heavy soil and the opposite on light soil. Winter oilseed rape established well in a reduced cultivation system. The crop yield in a reduced cultivation system was in many cases higher than after <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Even the easy and cheap cultivation systems as broadcasted seeding followed by cultivation with a Carrier or a cultivator resulted in good crop yields. The combination of cheap establishment and high yields has in many cases resulted in the best economy. In the experiments with different preceding crops, located outside Uppsala, there were more significant results between the different treatments. In the seedbed analysis there were more small aggregates in the seedbed in a reduced cultivation system. The preceding crop also seemed to {{have an effect on the}} aggregate size, with smallest aggregates after winter wheat as a preceding crop, followed by spring barley, fallow and active fallow. The penetration resistance was less after <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> then after shallow cultivation with a Carrier in the surface soil.

In late autumn, the plants were bigger after winter wheat as a preceding crop than after spring barley, although in the spring the difference was not that clear even if the tendency was the same.

These include low rainfall with high spatial and temporal variability, and significant loss of soil water through evaporation. An experiment was established at Matopos Research Station, Zimbabwe, {{to determine the effect}} of mulching and minimum tillage on maize (Zea mays L.) yield and soil water content. The experiment was run for two years at two sites: clay (Matopos Research Station fields) and sand (Lucydale fields) soils, in a 7 × 3 factorial combination of mulch rates (0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10 t ha− 1) and tillage methods (planting basins, ripper tine and <b>conventional</b> <b>plough).</b> Each treatment was replicated three times at each site in a split plot design. Maize residue was applied as mulch before tillage operations. Two maize varieties, a hybrid (SC 403) and an open pollinated variety (ZM 421), were planted. Maize yield and soil water content (0 – 30 and 30 – 60 cm depth) were measured under each treatment. On both soil types, neither mulching nor tillage method had a significant effect on maize grain yield. Tillage methods significantly influenced stover production with planting basins giving the highest stover yield (1. 1 t ha− 1) on sandy soil and conventional ploughing giving 3. 6 t ha− 1 on clay soil during the first season. The three tillage methods had no significant effect on seasonal soil water content, although planting basins collected more rainwater {{during the first half of}} the cropping period.

40|$|AbstractNo-tillage (NT) with residue {{retention}} {{is often}} suggested {{as an option}} to adapt cropping systems to drier conditions because yield in rain fed systems could benefit from increased soil water. But under wetter conditions, NT may lower yields, depending on soil and crop characteristics. In a future climate, inter-annual variability in wet and dry conditions is projected to increase in central Europe, in spite of drier mean conditions. Thus, long-term benefits of NT for yield stability remain uncertain. We addressed this question by analyzing the variability of absolute and relative yield {{in relation to the}} atmospheric water balance (P-ET 0) using data from a long-term experiment near Bern (Switzerland) comparing NT and <b>conventional</b> <b>plough</b> tillage (CT) on slightly humic sandy loam soil. There {{was no significant difference between}} CT and NT in mean yield for any of the crops, but for peas and beans, c. v. (%) was clearly higher under CT. In contrast, differences in c. v. between CT and NT for winter barley, winter wheat and maize were marginal. Relative yield (Yrel=YNT/YCT) varied across years for all crops. For peas, beans and winter wheat Yrel varied in relation to P-ET 0 during the period March to May. For peas and bean, Yrel was > 1 when P-ET 0 was negative, but showed no trend when positive, thus indicating yield improvements under NT after drier springs. In contrast, Yrel for winter wheat increased with increasing P-ET 0 indicating positive effects of NT under wetter springtime conditions. During the duration of the experiment (1994 - 2013), inter-annual variability of P-ET 0 for March-May was larger than during periods of equal length since 1900. Thus, in a future climate with more variable springtime conditions, the yield-effect of NT for each crop may be negative, positive or neutral, and in the long run NT appears to have only a marginal adaptation potential...|$|E
40|$|Human action upon soil by tillage determines {{important}} morphological, physical-chemical {{and biological}} changes, with different intensities and evaluative directions. Nowadays, it is internationally accepted {{the fact that}} global climatic changes are the results of human intervention in the bio-geo-chemical water and material cycle, and the sequestration of carbon in soil is considered an important intervention to limit these changes. Carbon sequestration in soil is net advantageous, improving the productivity and sustainability. The more the organic content in soil is higher the better soil aggregation is. The soil without organic content is compact. This reduces its capacity to infiltrate water, nutrients solubility and productivity, and that way it reduces the soil capacity for carbon sequestration. Organic matter is an extremely important constituent of soils and is vital {{to many of the}} hydrological, biological and chemical reactions required for sustaining plant life. We present the influence of <b>conventional</b> <b>plough</b> tillage system on soil, water and organic matter conservation in comparison with an alternative minimum tillage system (paraplow, chisel plow and rotary harrow). The application of minimum tillage systems increased the organic matter content 0. 8 % to 22. 1 % and water stabile aggregate content from 1. 3 % to 13. 6 %, in the 0 - 30 cm depth, as compared to the classical system. For the organic matter content and the wet aggregate stability, the statistical analysis of the data showed, increasing positive significance of minimum systems. While the soil fertility and the wet aggregate stability were initially low, the effect of conservation practices on the soil features resulted in a positive impact on the water permeability of the soil.

40|$|Planting basins and ripper tillage {{practices}} are major {{components of the}} recently introduced conservation agriculture package that is being extensively promoted for smallholder farming in Zimbabwe. Besides preparing land for crop planting, these two technologies also help in collecting and using rainwater more efficiently in semi-arid areas. The basin tillage is being targeted for households with limited or no access to draught animals while ripping is meant for smallholder farmers with some draught animal power. Trials were established at four farms in Gwanda and Insiza in southern Zimbabwe to determine soil water contributions and runoff water losses from plots under four different tillage treatments. The tillage treatments were hand-dug planting basins, ripping, conventional spring and double ploughing using animal-drawn implements. The initial intention was to measure soil water changes and runoff losses from cropped plots under the four {{tillage practices}}. However, due to total crop failure, only soil water and runoff were measured from bare plots between December 2006 and April 2007. Runoff losses were highest under <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Planting basins retained most of the rainwater that fell during each rainfall event. The amount of rainfall received at each farm significantly influenced the volume of runoff water measured. Runoff water volume increased with increase {{in the amount of}} rainfall received at each farm. Soil water content was consistently higher under basin tillage than the other three tillage treatments. Significant differences in soil water content were observed across the farms according to soil types from sand to loamy sand.

In {{the first year of}} the experiment, one TA was cultivated up and down the slope, one TA was cultivated on the contour, with a beetle bank acting as a vegetative barrier partway up the slope, and one had a mixed direction cultivation treatment, with cultivation and drilling conducted up and down the slope and all subsequent operations conducted on the contour. In the second year, this mixed treatment was replaced with contour cultivation. Results showed no significant reduction in runoff, sediment losses or {{total phosphorus}} losses from minimum tillage when compared to the <b>conventional</b> <b>plough</b> treatment, but there were increased losses of total dissolved phosphorus with minimum tillage. The mixed direction cultivation treatment increased surface runoff and losses of sediment and phosphorus. Increasing surface roughness with contour cultivation reduced surface runoff compared to up and down slope cultivation in both the plough and minimum tillage treatment areas, but this trend was not significant. Sediment and phosphorus losses in the contour cultivation treatment followed a very similar pattern to runoff. Combining contour cultivation with a vegetative barrier in the form of a beetle bank to reduce slope length resulted in a non-significant reduction in surface runoff, sediment and total phosphorus when compared to up and down-slope cultivation, but there was a clear trend towards reduced losses. However, the addition of a beetle bank did not provide a significant reduction in runoff, sediment losses or total phosphorus losses when compared to contour cultivation, suggesting only a marginal additional benefit. The economic implications for farmers of the different treatment options are investigated in order to assess their suitability for implementation at a field scale...|$|E

Differential pressure transducers {{were used to}} automate the water level measurement in the reservoir. The Mariotte bottle was automated {{by a set of}} solenoid valves which were connected via tubing to pre-defined depths in the Mariotte bottle. Based on design parameters tested in the laboratory (sensor sensitivity, water reservoir diameter, and bubbling rate) three identical tension infiltrometers connected to a single Mariotte bottle were built. A new reservoir system made of two plexiglass tubes of different diameter slotted in each other was found to reduce the measurement fluctuations caused by the disturbance created to rising bubbles in the reservoir. The new system was tested on a uniform sandy loam profile prepared in the soil bin laboratory and different analytical and numerical data analysis methods were compared. The measured steady state data were used to determine K(h) at different suctions using the analytical method proposed by Reynolds and Elrick (1991). The K(h) points obtained were fitted with the van Genuchten’s equation (van Genuchten, 1980) using the RETC program to calculate the best fit parameters Ks,  and n. These parameters were used as initial estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters in the numerical models HYDRUS 1 D and 2 D, in which transient cumulative flow data was used to determine the soil hydraulic functions via inverse modelling. The analysis of variance determined significantly higher K(h) values calculated by HYDRUS 1 D while the other methods did not differ from each other. Finally, the tension infiltrometer was used in the field on a sandy loam soil to characterise five different tillage treatments (<b>conventional</b> <b>plough,</b> shallow plough, minimum tillage, direct drill, and no-tillage).

40|$|Reduced tillage is {{interesting}} in many points of views and improved soil structure {{is a factor}} of great importance. In reduced tillage the labour intensive mouldboard plough is often replaced by disc or spring-tine cultivators. Tillage systems affect several soil properties, both biological and physical. Reduced tillage is often shown to improve soil structure and the method has in Sweden been best suited on strongly structured heavy clays. Weakly structured soils needs more loosening and reduced tillage has not been that successful on these types of soils. It can take several years with reduced tillage before the positive effects becomes beneficial. Measurements on soil properties affecting crop growth has been studied in field trials in south of Sweden on two farms. The randomized block designed trials consist of four tillage systems and they are listed as: (A 1) reduced tillage (15 cm), (A 2) reduced tillage (5 - 7 cm), (B) conventional ploughing (20 - 22 cm) and (C) shallow ploughing (12 - 15 cm). Measurements of dry bulk density, infiltration, penetration resistance and root development were performed under {{spring and early summer}} 2008. Furthermore preferential flow was studied with the dye tracer Brilliant Blue FCF using high resolution images. The measurements showed that the difference between the different tillage methods generally was small. The differences between ploughed and non-ploughed plots were more pronounced than between tillage depths. Dry bulk density in the topsoil does not always increase when <b>conventional</b> <b>plough</b> is replaced by reduced tillage systems. Increased tillage depth did not affect the penetration resistance in the non-ploughed plots. The ploughed plots generally had lower penetration resistance than the non ploughed plots and the shallow ploughed plot resulted in higher penetration resistance compared to the deep ploughed plots. On Charlottenlund root development was significantly higher in the non-ploughed plots which {{is interesting}} compared to other studies that have found higher root development in ploughed plots. Infiltration in the top soil was generally higher in the ploughed plots. At the depth of the plough pan the infiltration was higher in non-ploughed plots at Väby but no differences were found at Charlottenlund. The dye tracer experiment showed that there were no differences between ploughed and non-ploughed plots. The four different tillage methods did not significantly affect crop yields on Charlottenlund and Väby in 200...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a study on application of minimum tillage technologies when growing winter wheat. Experiments were performed in the sugar-beet-growing region with loamy chernozem within the period of 2005 – 2009. Aanalysed and evaluated were effects of different methods of soil processing on yield-forming factors in stands of winter wheat grown after three different preceding crops (i. e. alfalfa, maize for silage and pea). Evaluated were the following four variants of tillage: (1) <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> to the depth of 0. 22 [*]m (Variant 1); (2) ploughing to the depth of 0. 15 [*]m (Variant 2); (3) direct sowing into the untilled soil (Variant 3), and (4) shallow tillage to the depth of 0. 10 [*]m (Variant 4). The effect of different tillage intensity on winter wheat yields was statistically non-significant after all forecrops. After alfalfa, the highest and the lowest average yields were recorded in Variant 2 (i. e. with ploughing to the depth of 0. 15 [*]m) and Variant 3 (direct sowing into the untilled soil), respectively. After maize grown for silage, higher yields were obtained in Variant 2 and Variant 1 (<b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing)</b> while in Variants 4 and 3 the obtained yields were lower. When growing winter wheat after pea as a preceding crop, the highest and the lowest average yields were recorded after direct sowing (Variant 3) and in Variant 1 (i. e. ploughing to the depth of 0. 22 m), respectively. Results of studies on effect of different tillage technologies on yields of winter wheat crops indicate that under the given pedological and climatic conditions {{it is possible to}} apply methods of reduced tillage intensity. However, the choice of the corresponding technology must be performed with regard to the type of preceding crop...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of conservation agriculture (CA) for smallholders increased {{the competition for}} crop residues between crop and livestock enterprises of the mixed smallholder farming system. Smallholders practicing CA have resorted to using grass and leaf litter in addition to available crop residues. The effect of these different mulching materials on maize (Zea mays L.) growth and yield is not well documented in smallholder CA systems of southern Africa. A two-year experiment was run in 2012 / 13 and 2013 / 14 seasons to evaluate the effect of maize residues, grass (Hyparrhenia filipendula (L.) Stapf.) and leaf litter that farmers are currently using and residues from leguminous species, sunhemp (Crotolaria juncea L.) and Tephrosia (Tephrosia vogelii ((Hook) f.)) on maize nitrogen (N) uptake, growth and yield. Significant differences in soil water content across treatments were only observed during March in 2012 / 13 season. Maize residues retained more soil water and Tephrosia had the lowest soil water content when seasonal rainfall pattern was erratic. Grass and Tephrosia treatments had the lowest chlorophyll content. <b>Conventional</b> <b>ploughing,</b> maize residues and leaf litter had similar chlorophyll content which {{was significantly higher than}} grass and Tephrosia treatments. At a site with higher initial soil fertility <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> treatment out yielded the other treatments by 727 – 1265 kg ha − 1. With more degraded sandy soil conventional practice had 119 – 430 kg ha − 1 more maize grain than the CA treatments. With adequate fertilization, the mulching materials have a similar effect on maize growth in basins and direct seeding. Further studies on different application rates of mulching materials and mineral N fertilizer, and nutrient release patterns of these residues are critical in order to better understand soil fertility management under smallholder CA systems...|$|R
40|$|Reduced tillage enhances soil {{fertility}} {{and can help}} to avoid erosion. The drawback of increased weed pressure is a challenge for organic farmers due to the prohibition of herbicides. Mulch could {{be a way to}} suppress weeds and to introduce reduced tillage systems in potato cultivation. The number of perennial weeds were monitored in a comparison of two potato cultivation systems: <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> and hilling versus reduced tillage with dead mulch. In 2014, perennial weeds in the mulch system increased to double the number compared to the ploughed system. The reverse pattern was observed in 2015. This reversed effect was due to improved application methods of mulch with smaller particle size and a closer C/N-Ratio in the mulch in 2015 in combination with a severe spring drought in 2015 but not in 2014...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the capacity of a soil tillage system in soil conservation, in productivity and in energy efficiency. The minimum tillage and no-tillage systems represent good alternatives to the <b>conventional</b> (<b>plough)</b> system of soil tillage, due to their conservation effects on soil and to the good production of crops (Maize, 96 %- 98 % of conventional tillage for minimum tillage, and 99. 8 % of conventional tillage for no till; Soybeans, 103 %- 112 % of conventional tillage for minimum tillage and 117 % of conventional tillage for no till; Wheat, 93 %- 97 % of conventional tillage for minimum tillage and 117 % of conventional tillage for no till. The choice of the right soil tillage system for crops in rotation help reduce energy consumption, thus for maize: 97 %- 98 % energy consumption of conventional tillage when using minimum tillage and 91 % when using no-tillage; for soybeans: 98 % energy consumption of conventional tillage when using minimum tillage and 93 when using no-tillage; for wheat: 97 %- 98 % energy consumption of conventional tillage when using minimum tillage and 92 % when using no-tillage. Energy efficiency is in relation to reductions in energy use, but also might include the efficiency and impact of the tillage system on the cultivated plant. For all crops in rotation, energy efficiency (energy produced from 1 MJ consumed) was the best in no-tillage — 10. 44 MJ ha− 1 for maize, 6. 49 MJ ha− 1 for soybean, and 5. 66 MJ ha− 1 for wheat. An analysis of energy-efficiency in agricultural systems includes the energy consumed-energy produced-energy yield comparisons, but must be supplemented by soil energy efficiency, based on the conservative effect of the agricultural system. Only then will the agricultural system be sustainable, durable in agronomic, economic and ecological terms. The implementation of minimum and no-tillage soil systems has increased the organic matter content from 2 % to 7. 6 % and water stable aggregate content from 5. 6 % to 9. 6 %, at 0 – 30 cm depth, as compared to the conventional system. Accumulated water supply was higher (with 12. 4 %- 15 %) for all minimum and no-tillage systems and increased bulk density values by 0. 01 %- 0. 03 % (no significant difference) While the soil fertility and the wet aggregate stability have initially been low, the effect of conservation practices on the soil characteristics led to a positive impact on the water permeability in the soil. Availability of soil moisture during the crop growth period led to a better plant watering condition. Subsequent release of conserved soil water regulated the plant water condition and soil structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of cover crops and non-inversion tillage regimes at minimising farm-scale nutrient losses were assessed across a large, commercial arable farm in Norfolk, UK. The trial area, covering 143 ha, was split into three blocks: winter fallow with mouldboard ploughing (Block J); shallow non-inversion tillage with a winter oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus) cover crop (Block P); and direct drilling with a winter oilseed radish cover crop (Block L). Soil, water and vegetation chemistry across the trial area were monitored over the 2012 / 13 (pre-trial), 2013 / 14 (cover crops and non-inversion tillage) and 2014 / 15 (non-inversion tillage only) farm years. Results revealed oilseed radish reduced nitrate (NO 3 ¬¬-N) leaching losses in soil water by 75 – 97 % {{relative to the}} fallow block, but had no impact upon phosphorus (P) losses. Corresponding reductions in riverine NO 3 ¬¬-N concentrations were not observed, despite the trial area covering 20 % of the catchment. Mean soil NO 3 ¬¬-N concentrations were reduced by ~ 77 % at 60 – 90 cm depth beneath the cover crop, highlighting the ability of deep rooting oilseed radish to scavenge nutrients from deep within the soil profile. Alone, direct drilling and shallow non-inversion tillage were ineffective at reducing soil water NO 3 ¬¬-N and P concentrations relative to <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Applying starter fertiliser to the cover crop increased radish biomass and nitrogen (N) uptake, but resulted in net N accumulation within the soil. There was negligible difference between the gross margins of direct drilling (£ 731 ha- 1) and shallow non-inversion tillage (£ 758 ha- 1) with a cover crop and <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> with fallow (£ 745 ha- 1), demonstrating farm productivity can be maintained whilst mitigating diffuse pollution. The results presented here support the wider adoption of winter oilseed radish cover crops to reduce NO 3 ¬¬-N leaching losses in arable systems, but caution that it may take several years before catchment-scale impacts downstream are detected...|$|R
40|$|Permanent grasslands {{receiving}} low fertiliser inputs {{account for}} the largest area of land managed under the agri-environment schemes. However, it is likely they currently provide minimal benefits for biodiversity or ecosystem services. In 2008 a multi-factorial experiment was established to develop simple, low cost options to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services for grassland. Factors investigated were seed mixture composition (grass, grass+legume, grass+legume+forb), seed bed preparation (minimal cultivation vs <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing),</b> and the type (cut vs grazed) and intensity (typical vs summer rested) of management. There were large differences {{in the composition of}} the plant community between different seed mixtures. Deep cultivation significantly increased cover of non-leguminous forbs. Cutting increased cover of legumes and non-legumes compared with grazing. Abundance and diversity of pollinators was lowest in the grass only seed mix. Grazing had a negative effect on pollinators compared with cutting. Finally, reducing intensity of cutting or grazing enhanced pollinator diversity...|$|R
40|$|During 2007 – 2011 we {{assessed}} content {{and quality of}} humic substances with relationship to soil structure. Object of study was Haplic Chernozem (Hrušovany nad Jevišovkou, Czech Republic) under three different tillage systems: – <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> {{to a depth of}} 0. 22 m (CP); – reduced tillage with shallow harrowing to a depth of 0. 15 m (RTSH); – reduced tillage with subsoiling to a depth of 0. 35 – 0. 40 m (RTS). Isolation of humic acids was made according to IHSS standard method using spectrometer Shimadzu 8700. Aggregates stability was determined by wet sieving method. Results showed that macrostructure stability was directly connected with time of sampling and content and quality of humic substances. After five years of experiment statistically significant differences in humic substances content were found. The highest structure stability, quantity and quality of humic substances were achieved under reduced tillage with shallow harrowing...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{farmers are}} {{interested}} in adopting conservation tillage to preserve soil quality and fertility and to prevent soil erosion. Within {{the framework of a}} French national study, we compared <b>conventional</b> (<b>ploughing)</b> and conservation tillage systems in organic farming for arable and vegetable cropping systems. Field experiments and on-farm surveys were conducted in several regions of France in order to assess the effects of different tillage systems on soil fertility (physical, chemical, biological) and on weed and crop development. Conservation tillage techniques induced a more compact soil, an increase of carbon and microorganisms in the first soil layer, and an increase of earthworm biomass for very superficial tillage. Weed control was only a major problem for the very superficial tillage, which in turn generated lower crop yields than conventional tillage. The main issues raised by this programme deal with the long-term effects of these techniques on soil fertility, and the improvement of conservation tillage techniques in organic farming...|$|R
