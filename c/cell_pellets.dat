5000|$|Tricine is a {{commonly}} used electrophoresis buffer {{and is also}} used in resuspension of <b>cell</b> <b>pellets.</b> It has a higher negative (more negative) charge than glycine allowing it to migrate faster. In addition its high ionic strength causes more ion movement and less protein movement. This allows for low molecular weight proteins to be separated in lower percent acrylamide gels. Tricine has been documented in the separation of proteins {{in the range of}} 1 to 100 kDa by electrophoresis. [...] The tricine buffer at 25 mmol/L was found to be the most effective buffer among the ten tested for ATP assays using firefly luciferase.

5000|$|Laser Ablation Electrospray Ionization (LAESI) is an ambient {{ionization}} method for mass spectrometry that combines laser ablation from a mid-infrared (mid-IR) laser with a secondary electrospray ionization (ESI) process. The mid-IR laser {{is used to}} generate gas phase particles which are then ionized through interactions with charged droplets from the ESI source. LAESI was developed by Professor Akos Vertes and Dr. Peter Nemes in 2007 and is now marketed commercially by Protea Biosciences, Inc. LAESI is a novel ionization source for mass spectrometry (MS) {{that has been used}} to perform MS imaging of plants, tissues, <b>cell</b> <b>pellets,</b> and even single cells. [...] In addition, LAESI has been used to analyze historic documents and untreated biofluids such as urine and blood. [...] The technique of LAESI is performed at atmospheric pressure and therefore overcomes many of the obstacles of traditional MS techniques, including extensive and invasive sample preparation steps and the use of high vacuum. LAESI can be used to perform MS analysis of many different classes of compounds ranging from small molecules, such as pharmaceuticals, saccharides, lipids, and metabolites to larger biomolecules like peptides and proteins. [...] LAESI has also been shown to have a quantitative dynamic range of 4 decades and a limit of detection (LOD) of 8 fmol with verapamil, a small pharmaceutical molecule. [...] The technique has a lateral resolution of <200 μm for imaging applications and has been used for 3D imaging of plant tissues. [...] Additionally, in cell-by-cell LAESI imaging experiments single cells can be used as the pixels of the molecular image. This LAESI application uses etched optical fibers to produce laser spot sizes of <50 µm to deliver the laser energy and has also been utilized in single cell analysis experiments.|$|E

MethodsThe expression levels of the selected nine leading surface markers in synovial cells from knee joints in 15 patients with primary knee osteoarthritis were evaluated at the stage of isolation and after cultivation using flow cytometry. We obtained positive and negative cells for each surface marker using a magnetically activated cell sorting method and compared chondrogenic potentials between the positive and the negative <b>cell</b> <b>pellets.</b> ResultsCD 29, CD 44, CD 73, and CD 90 were expressed on the most synovial cells at the isolation stage and on almost all cells at stage of P 0 and P 1. CD 133 was rarely expressed at any stages of the evaluated cells. CD 166 was expressed in 7. 1 % of cells at the isolation stage on average, but this expression increased after cell passages. The expressions of CD 10 and CD 105 also increased after cell passages while the expression of CD 49 a made no significant difference at progressive stages of isolation and passage. Comparison of chondrogenic potentials between positive and negative <b>cell</b> <b>pellets</b> for each marker revealed that only CD 105 - and CD 166 -positive <b>cell</b> <b>pellets</b> showed better chondrogenic potentials (type II collagen gene expression, cartilage matrix formation, and GAG expression) than the corresponding negative <b>cell</b> <b>pellets.</b> ConclusionOur study suggests that CD 105 and CD 166 would be valuable surface markers associated with chondrogenic potential; thus, CD 105 - and CD 166 -enriched cells derived from human synovium would be practical and valuable sources for cartilage regeneration...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>pellets</b> {{formed by}} {{centrifugation}} provided a good system {{to study the}} osmotic behavior, electroporation, and interaction between cells. Rabbit erythrocyte pellets were {{used in this study}} because they were simpler than nucleated cells to model analytically. Structurally, <b>cell</b> <b>pellets</b> possessed properties of porous solid bodies and gels. Electrically, <b>cell</b> <b>pellets</b> were shown to behave as a parallel set of resistance, Rp, and capacitance, Cp. Information on pellet structures was obtained from electric measurements. The pellet resistance reflected the intercellular conductivity (porosity and gap conductivity), whereas the pellet capacitance depended mostly on membrane capacitance. The pellet resistance was more sensitive to experimental conditions. The intercellular gap distance can be derived from pellet porosity measurements, providing the cell volume and surface area were known. Rp increased and relaxed exponentially with time when centrifugation started and stopped; the cycles were reversible. When supernatants were exchanged with solutions containing hypotonic electrolytes or macromolecules (such as PEG) after the pellets were formed, complicated responses to different colloidal osmotic effects were observed. A transient decrease followed by a large increase of Rp was observed after the application of a porating electric pulse, as expected from a momentary membrane breakdown, followed by a limited colloidal-osmotic swelling of pelleted cells. The equilibrium values of Rp, Cp, pellet porosity, and intercellular distances were measured and calculated as functions of cell number, centrifugation force, and ionic strength of the exchanged supernatant.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} dissolved oxygen tension (DO) on the redifferentiation of dedifferentiated adult human nasal septum chondrocytes cultured as pellets. - Design: After isolation, human nasal chondrocytes were expanded in monolayer culture, which resulted in their dedifferentiation. Dedifferentiated cells were pelleted, transferred to a bioreactor and maintained for up to 21 days at 100 % DO (21 % oxygen), 25 % DO (5. 25 % oxygen) or 5 % DO (1 % oxygen), which was controlled in the liquid phase. Redifferentiation was assessed by staining the extracellular matrix with safranin-O and by the immunolocalization of collagen types I, II, IX and of a fibroblast membrane marker (11 -fibrau). In addition, glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and DNA content were determined spectrophotometrically. - Results: In monolayer culture, cells dedifferentiated and multiplied 90 - to 100 -fold. <b>Cell</b> <b>pellets</b> cultured in a bioreactor under conditions of low oxygen tension (25 % DO or 5 % DO) stained intensely for GAGs and for collagen type II, but very weakly for collagen type I. After 14 days of culturing, <b>cell</b> <b>pellets</b> maintained at 5 % DO stained more intensely for collagen IX and more weakly for 11 -fibrau than did those incubated at 25 % DO. After 21 days of culturing the GAG content of <b>cell</b> <b>pellets</b> maintained at 5 % DO was significantly greater than that of those incubated at 25 % DO. Under air-saturated conditions (100 % DO), the DNA and GAG contents of <b>cell</b> <b>pellets</b> decreased with time in culture. After 21 days of culturing, both parameters were substantially lower in <b>cell</b> <b>pellets</b> maintained at 100 % DO than in those incubated at low oxygen tensions. The staining signals for collagen types II and IX were much weaker, and those for the markers of dedifferentiation (collagen type I and 11 -fibrau) much stronger under air-saturated conditions than at low oxygen tensions. - Conclusion: These observations demonstrate that using the present set-up, low oxygen tension stimulates the redifferentiation of dedifferentiated adult human nasal chondrocytes in pellet cultures...|$|E

40|$|Osteoarthritis, {{the most}} {{prevalent}} joint disease in the United Kingdom, is a progressive condition that results in end-stage full-thickness cartilage loss and has important social and economic impacts on society. Since cartilage lacks regenerative capabilities, {{it is essential to}} develop approaches to initiate and enhance cartilage regeneration. In this context, tissue engineering is emerging as an attractive approach for the regeneration of cartilage tissue damaged due to disease or trauma. A scaffold-free cartilage construct, analogous to those found during embryonic precartilage condensation, has received much attention as an alternative novel modality for cartilage tissue engineering. Cartilage repair with scaffold-free tissue more closely resembles the natural situation and mimics the features of the original tissue. Moreover, scaffold-free cartilage implants can overcome the complications caused by the use of suboptimal scaffolds by avoiding the need for a foreign scaffold at all. Culturing cells into tissue patches without the requirement for a scaffold can be achieved through cell sheet engineering, which uses thermo-responsive culture dishes. However, the high costs of the tissue culture consumables, and the relatively low cellular yield, makes this process less attractive. This thesis presents a novel method for generating shape-, size- and thickness-adjustable 3 -dimensional scaffold-free <b>cell</b> <b>pellet</b> sheets for use as implantable biological cell patches for cartilage tissue engineering. This new technique of bioengineering scaffold-free <b>cell</b> <b>pellet</b> sheets proves to be reproducible, easily applicable, sizable and thickness adjustable. Stem cells have added a new thrust to tissue engineering. Their distinctive self-renewal and plasticity have not only optimized many tissue engineering developments, but also rendered feasible some applications which would otherwise be unattainable with somatic cells. Human mesenchymal stem cells (HMSCs) were used to examine the optimal condition for generating <b>cell</b> <b>pellet</b> sheets with this new method. Furthermore, the resultant differentiated pellet sheets were compared directly with HMSCs, human chondrocytes and human fibroblasts alone to evaluate the feasibility of using this <b>cell</b> <b>pellet</b> sheet for clinical applications in terms of their biological and mechanical properties. The results of this thesis suggest that the engineered scaffold-free, chondrogenic, differentiated MSC pellet sheet not only exhibits desirable biologic features similar to chondrocytes, but also demonstrates good integrative and viscoelastic potential that might offer exciting possibilities for the development of novel biologically-based clinical therapies. In summary the data presented herein indicate the following points: The differentiation of human MSCs into chondrogenic cells was achieved. A novel approach of centrifugal seeding on a PDMS surface was shown to effectively generate chondrogenic-differentiated <b>cell</b> <b>pellet</b> sheets without impairing the biological functions of chondrocytes. Various cell types such as human MSCs, human chondrocytes and human fibroblasts were found to respond well to the novel methodology and generated viable, cohesive, less shrinkable, and readily-detachable <b>cell</b> <b>pellet</b> sheets, the size and thickness of which could be adapted as required. The results obtained were superior to those obtained using the conventional thermo-responsive culture dish method. This new methodology developed in this thesis provides an approach to in vitro <b>cell</b> <b>pellet</b> sheet generation which is closer to the physiological process of cartilage development and which proved valuable for the study of in vitro generation of scaffold-free cell patches as an important adjunct to many traditional cartilage restorative procedures. Future research on in vivo assessment of the cell sheet and the functional role of these sheets in repairing damaged cartilage is recommended. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
