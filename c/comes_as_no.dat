According to Einstein, gravity is not a force – it is a property of space-time itself. Loop quantum gravity is an attempt to develop a quantum theory of gravity based directly on Einstein's geometrical formulation.|$|E

He was a film critic, he founded and served {{as executive director of the}} Film Institute in Havana, was the head of the Latin American Film Foundation, and wrote several screenplays. For his first script he worked with Carlos Fuentes on Juan Rulfo's El gallo de oro. His other screenplays include the films Tiempo de morir (1966), (1985) and Un señor muy viejo con unas alas enormes (1988), as well as the television series Amores difíciles (1991).|$|E

2500|$|The Maltese {{use their}} olive oil quite generously. In 2012, they ranked 8th {{in the world}} in per capita olive oil consumption. Since the island's history is {{interwoven}} with olive oil production, this statistic <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise. With olive oil processing equipment dating back to the Roman Empire, and possibly even before this period, the consumption of oil has since {{become an integral part of}} the Maltese diet. For instance, in 1804, French writer [...] noted that, [...] "a clove of garlic, or an onion, anchovies dipped in oil, and salted fish", was the [...] "usual diet" [...] of the Maltese. Nowadays, the use of oil in Maltese cuisine is still predominant, testimony to this is the popular Maltese snack [...] "ħobż biż-żejt", which literally translates to [...] "bread with oil".|$|E
2500|$|Public {{authorities}} should oppose {{laws which}} undermine natural law; scientists should further study effective methods of natural birth control; doctors should further familiarize themselves with this teaching, {{in order to}} be able to give advice to their patients, priests must spell out clearly and completely the Church's teaching on marriage. The encyclical acknowledges that [...] "perhaps not everyone will easily accept this particular teaching", but that [...] "...it <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise to the church that she, no less than her Divine founder is destined to be a sign of contradiction." [...] Noted is the duty of proclaiming the entire moral law, [...] "both natural and evangelical." [...] The encyclical also points out that the Roman Catholic Church cannot [...] "declare lawful what is in fact unlawful", because she is concerned with [...] "safeguarding the holiness of marriage, in order to guide married life to its full human and Christian perfection." [...] This is to be the priority for his fellow bishops and priests and lay people. The Pope predicts that future progress in social cultural and economic spheres will make marital and family life more joyful, provided God's design for the world is faithfully followed. The encyclical closes with an appeal to observe the natural laws of the Most High God. [...] "These laws must be wisely and lovingly observed." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 18. It {{is to be}} {{anticipated}} that perhaps not everyone will easily accept this particular teaching. There is too much clamorous outcry against {{the voice of the}} Church, and this is intensified by modern means of communication. But it <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise to the Church that she, no less than her divine Founder, is destined to be a [...] "sign of contradiction.") She does not, because of this, evade the duty imposed on her of proclaiming humbly but firmly the entire moral law, both natural and evangelical. Since the Church did not make either of these laws, she cannot be their arbiter—only their guardian and interpreter. It could never be right for her to declare lawful what is in fact unlawful, since that, by its very nature, is always opposed to the true good of man. In preserving intact the whole moral law of marriage, the Church is convinced that she is contributing {{to the creation of a}} truly human civilization. She urges man not to betray his personal responsibilities by putting all his faith in technical expedients. In this way she defends the dignity of husband and wife. This course of action shows that the Church, loyal to the example and teaching of the divine Savior, is sincere and unselfish in her regard for men whom she strives to help even now during this earthly pilgrimage [...] "to share God's life as sons of the living God, the Father of all men".|$|E

2500|$|From {{contemporary}} reviews, Metacritic, which assigns {{a weighted}} average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film an average score of 40 based on 12 reviews from 1987, with the review opinions summarized as [...] "mixed or average". Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times {{described it as}} [...] "grisly and dull, with few surprises." [...] Dean Lamanna wrote in Cinefantastique that [...] "the militarized monster movie tires under its own derivative weight." [...] Variety wrote that the film was a [...] "slightly above-average actioner that tries to compensate for tissue-thin-plot with ever-more-grisly death sequences and impressive special effects." [...] Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times proclaimed it [...] "arguably one of the emptiest, feeblest, most derivative scripts ever made as a major studio movie." [...] Feminist Susan Faludi called it one of [...] "an endless stream of war and action movies" [...] in which [...] "women are reduced to mute and incidental characters or banished altogether." [...] Though decrying a few plot holes, critic Roger Ebert was more complimentary of the film, rating it {{three out of four}} stars, and writing, [...] "it supplies what it claims to supply: an effective action movie." [...] The Monthly Film Bulletin stated that the special effects were [...] "substituted for suspense. The early appearance of the Predator makes the final gladiatorial conflict predictable, and the monster's multiple transformations also exhaust interest in its final appearance, which <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> real surprise." ...|$|E
