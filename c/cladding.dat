5|$|The {{pyramid of}} Userkaf was {{apparently}} {{the object of}} restoration work in antiquity under the impulse of Khaemweset (1280–1225 BC), fourth son of Ramses II. This is attested by inscriptions on stone <b>cladding</b> showing Khaemweset with offering bearers.|$|E
40|$|The {{corrosion}} resistance of aluminum 7075 T 651 in full <b>clad</b> (Alclad), partial <b>clad,</b> and bare (unclad) forms was compared after 300 hours of corrosion exposure in an acidic salt spray cabinet test at 36 °C. After corrosion exposure, severe to moderate exfoliation corrosion was observed on the unprotected medium sized test panel, light general corrosion was observed on the partially <b>clad</b> panel, and patches of corrosion not penetrating the <b>clad</b> layer were observed on the fully <b>clad</b> panel. After corrosion tests, the tensile strength of partially <b>clad,</b> fully <b>clad,</b> and unprotected panels decreased by 3. 4 %, 4. 0 %, and 5. 3 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction (<b>CLAD)</b> is {{the main}} {{limitation}} to long-term survival after lung transplantation. Although <b>CLAD</b> is usually not responsive to treatment, earlier identification may improve treatment prospects. In a nested case control study, 1 -year post transplant surveillance bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples were obtained from incipient <b>CLAD</b> (n = 9) and <b>CLAD</b> free (n = 8) lung transplant recipients. Incipient <b>CLAD</b> cases were diagnosed with <b>CLAD</b> within 2 years, while controls were free from <b>CLAD</b> for at least 4 years following bronchoscopy. Transcription profiles in the BAL cell pellets were assayed with the HG-U 133 Plus 2. 0 microarray (Affymetrix). Differential gene expression analysis, based on an absolute fold change (incipient <b>CLAD</b> vs no <b>CLAD)</b> > 2. 0 and an unadjusted p-value ≤ 0. 05, generated a candidate list containing 55 differentially expressed probe sets (51 up-regulated, 4 down-regulated). The cell pellets in incipient <b>CLAD</b> cases were skewed toward immune response pathways, dominated by genes related to recruitment, retention, activation and proliferation of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD 8 + T-cells and natural killer cells). Both hierarchical clustering and a supervised machine learning tool were able to correctly categorize most samples (82. 3 % and 94. 1 % respectively) into incipient <b>CLAD</b> and CLAD-free categories. These findings suggest that a pathobiology, similar to AR, precedes a clinical diagnosis of <b>CLAD.</b> A larger prospective investigation of the BAL cell pellet transcriptome as a biomarker for <b>CLAD</b> risk stratification is warranted...|$|R
40|$|<b>Clad</b> {{materials}} can offer several performance advantages over unclad materials including better corrosion resistance, increased mechanical wear, improved joining qualities, and enhanced metallurgical properties. <b>Clad</b> materials are used extensively in automotive and building products, aerospace applications, {{and air conditioning}} equipment. <b>Clad</b> products pose special production problems due to their unique composition. These products might require <b>clad</b> on one or both sides and, depending on the product, the <b>clad</b> and core alloys come in several combinations. For proper process and quality control, products are required to be sampled {{to ensure that the}} <b>clad</b> layer is within a certain tolerance band for maximum and minimum thickness. The eddy current method described here can be employed to make a rapid, nondestructive determination of the <b>clad</b> thickness...|$|R
5|$|The {{stainless}} steel <b>cladding</b> is ribbed and riveted {{in the shape}} of sunbeams, with many triangular windows. Due to the curved shape of the dome, the Nirosta sheets had to be measured on site, so most of the work was carried out in workshops on the building's 67th and 75th floors.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium foil {{is used in}} <b>cladding</b> {{titanium}} {{to steel}} because it is compatible with both iron and titanium. The moderate thermal neutron-capture cross-section and the short half-life of the isotopes produced by neutron capture makes vanadium a suitable material for the inner structure of a fusion reactor.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{physical}} {{difference between}} these metals is their density, with zirconium having about one-half the density of hafnium. The most notable nuclear properties of hafnium are its high thermal neutron-capture cross-section and that the nuclei of several different hafnium isotopes readily absorb two or more neutrons apiece. In contrast with this, zirconium is practically transparent to thermal neutrons, and {{it is commonly used}} for the metal components of nuclear reactors – especially the <b>cladding</b> of their nuclear fuel rods.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAluminum {{and copper}} <b>clad</b> ingots have gained great {{attention}} because its versatility to wide application areas, such as brazing sheet, light weight electrical wire and <b>clad</b> plate. In general, <b>clad</b> sheet and wire can be fabricated by rolling bonding or adhesive bonding. However these processes require complicated pre-treatment and processing and its processing cost is high. In this study, casting of aluminum and copper <b>clad</b> ingot was suggested and integrated by modification of {{direct chill casting}} and horizontal casting. Key parameter for successful interface bonding was precise control of cooling rate in the mould divider. To improve the bonding behavior and microstructure of <b>clad</b> ingot, electromagnetic stirring was applied during continuous casting process. By applying electromagnetic stirring, the interface bonding of <b>clad</b> ingot was improved with refined microstructure. In result, uniform and strongly bonded aluminum and copper <b>clad</b> ingot was fabricated under electromagnetic field. Finally preliminary study of rolling and extrusion of <b>clad</b> ingots were conducted and it shows promising results for fabrication of <b>clad</b> sheets and wire...|$|R
40|$|WC/Ni <b>clad</b> layers were {{produced}} on H 13 tool steel substrates with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser and optical fibres using the injected powder technique. The effects of parameters, such as laser beam profile, WC powder shape and substrate pre-heat temperature on the <b>clad</b> layer microstructure and wear properties were investigated. The microhardness of the <b>clad</b> layers {{was measured using}} a Vickers microhardness tester. The microstructure of the <b>clad</b> layers was assessed by optical and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that up to 1 mm thick, fully dense and crack-free of WC/Ni <b>clad</b> layers can be formed on H 13 substrates. The results further show that the higher is the microhardness of the <b>clad</b> layers, the higher is its wear resistance. Average surface microhardness values of the <b>clad</b> layers were as high as 650 HV. WC particle shape influences the microstructure and wear resistance of <b>clad</b> layer with crushed particles producing more wear resistant surfaces. The <b>clad</b> layers abrasive wear resistance was a factor of 510 times {{higher than that of}} unclad H 13 tool steel...|$|R
40|$|A Nd-YAG laser {{was used}} to <b>clad</b> Mo/TiC {{onto the surface of}} Aluminum Alloy AA 6061. Experimental results {{indicated}} that the Mo /TiC <b>clad</b> layer has good metallurgical bonding with the substrate. TiC particulates are uniformly dispersed in the <b>clad</b> surface. The optimised <b>clad</b> layer with a pre-mixed paste composition of 30 %Mo 70 %TiC exhibited the best wear resistance during a pin-on-disc abrasive wear test. The microhardness of the <b>clad</b> layer is 5 - 10 times higher than the as-received Al alloy. The microstructures, chemical compositions and the worn surface of the <b>clad</b> layers were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) ...|$|R
5|$|Building traditions {{varied by}} region {{and type of}} structure. Food storage houses - stabbur - were usually built on stilts in ways that made it {{difficult}} for mice and rats, but not cats, to get in. Exterior <b>cladding</b> varied by region, often to take into account local climate conditions. Roofs were often covered with birch bark and sod.|$|E
5|$|Chromium oxides {{are also}} used as a green color in glassmaking and as a glaze in ceramics. Green {{chromium}} oxide is extremely light-fast and as such is used in <b>cladding</b> coatings.

5|$|During {{the later}} 1920s, Holden {{designed}} {{a series of}} replacement buildings and new façades for station improvements around the UERL's network. Many of these featured Portland stone <b>cladding</b> and variations of the glazed screens developed for the Morden extension. At Piccadilly Circus, {{one of the busiest}} stations on the system, Holden designed (1925–28) a spacious travertine-lined circulating concourse and ticket hall below the roadway of the junction from which banks of escalators gave access to the platforms below.|$|E
50|$|A quadruply <b>clad</b> fiber has the {{advantage}} of very low macrobending losses. It also has two zero-dispersion points, and moderately low dispersion over a wider wavelength range than a singly <b>clad</b> fiber or a doubly <b>clad</b> fiber.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{delineate}} the genus Cladophora in South Africa, several sites along the Cape peninsula were sampled and sequences for the partial 26 S {{region of the}} rRNA were obtained and a phylogram was constructed. The aims {{of this study were}} to provide a robust phylogenetic tree describing the relationship between members of the genus Cladophora and related taxa and to determine the origins of South Africa's estuarine species of Cladophora. After DNA extraction and cycle sequencing of products, sequences were aligned and compared to several east coast species (obtained from GENBANK) and a phylogram was constructed. The results yielded several clades within Cladophora; <b>Clad.</b> capensis grouping with <b>Clad.</b> isaacii, <b>Clad</b> sericea and <b>Clad.</b> dalmatica; Cheatomorpha forming a polyphyletic group within Cladophora; and <b>Clad.</b> vagabunda and <b>Clad.</b> laetevirens grouping with the estuarine species. As no <b>Clad.</b> vagabunda or <b>Clad.</b> laetevirens are found along the coast of South Africa, the origins of its estuarine species still remain a mystery and needs further investigation...|$|R
5|$|Geometric motifs are {{carved in}} the Price Building's stone <b>cladding,</b> {{especially}} over the first few levels.

The renovation included installation of new platform staircases, new wall tiles, new columns and column <b>cladding,</b> new platform pavings, new entrances/exits, new low-vibration track, and new mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection, and communication systems. The contract for renovation of the station was awarded to Judlau Contracting on January 13, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{has many}} uses in the {{construction}} industry; lead sheets are used as architectural metals in roofing material, <b>cladding,</b> flashing, gutters and gutter joints, and on roof parapets. Detailed lead moldings are used as decorative motifs to fix lead sheet. Lead is still used in statues and sculptures, including for armatures. In the past it was often used to balance the wheels of cars; for environmental reasons this use is being phased {{out in favor of}} other materials.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new {{analytical}} model for cold and hot bond rolling of <b>clad</b> sheet unbounded before rolling is derived {{to investigate the}} stress field of the <b>clad</b> sheet at the roll gap by using the direct formulation without the Runge Kutta numerical method. Constant shear friction between the rolls and the <b>clad</b> sheet is assumed. Due to the <b>clad</b> sheet unbounded before rolling, double-layer sheets are not bonded {{at the entrance of}} the roll gap. Thus the stress field of the roll gap for this model is different from that for <b>clad</b> sheet bonded firmly before rolling. In this study, the neutral point between the rolls and the <b>clad</b> sheet, the rolling pressure distribution along the contact interface between the rolls and the <b>clad</b> sheet, the horizontal stresses in the component layers of the <b>clad</b> sheet, the rolling force, and the rolling torque etc., can be easily and rapidly calculated by using the developed {{analytical model}}. In addition, it is a valuable result from this study to obtain the bonding point of the interface and the thickness ratio of <b>clad</b> sheet at the exit. Furthermore, the bonding conditions for the unbounded <b>clad</b> sheet are found to offer useful knowledge in performing bond rolling to avoid manufacturing defects...|$|R
40|$|Effect of heat {{treatment}} on bonding characteristics and interfacial microstructures in explosively welded titanium/SUS 430 {{ferritic stainless steel}} <b>clad</b> was investigated. The average shear strength of the <b>clad</b> annealed at 1073 K for 3. 6 ks was 338 MPa and was equivalent to about 60 % of that of an as-welded <b>clad.</b> The strength of the <b>clad</b> annealed at 1073 K gradually decreased to 242 MPa with increasing holding time up to 360 ks. The same tendency {{was obtained from the}} <b>clad</b> annealed at 1173 K. On the other hand, the strength of the <b>clad</b> annealed at 1273 K drastically decreased to 107 MPa with increasing holding time up to 360 ks. The <b>clad</b> annealed at 1073 and 1173 K yielded TiC layer at the bonding interface, while the reaction layer in the <b>clad</b> annealed 1273 K consisted of TiC, FeTi, Fe_ 2 Ti and χ(Fe_ Cr_ Ti_ 8) from titanium side. It was noted that chromium existed in the Fe_ 2 Ti, which has wide solubility limit for chromium, and χ compounds formed at the SUS 430 side. The TiC layer in the former <b>clads</b> acts as a barrier for diffusion of titanium, iron and chromium across the bonding interface and prevents the growth of intermetallic compounds. The <b>clad</b> formed TiC layer at the bonding interface preserved high bonding strength even after prolonged annealing...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Of {{this paper}} is to realize the casting of the <b>clad</b> strip by only one process. Therefore, the {{investigation}} of the ability of the casting of the <b>clad</b> strip by a vertical type twin roll caster was operated. The aim of the use of the twin roll caster to make <b>clad</b> strip was in the reduction of the production-energy of the <b>clad</b> strip. Design/methodology/approach: Used {{in the present study was}} a vertical type twin roll caster with the scriber. The scriber was used to prevent the mixture of the two kinds of the melts. The scriber was set at roll-bite, and the scriber contacted to the one of solidification layer. The melt was stopped by the scriber and the only the solidification layer was dragged by the roll. Findings: The <b>clad</b> strip with the clear interface could be by the vertical type twin roll caster with the scriber. The scriber was useful to drag only the solid and semisolid layer. The two kinds of strips were connected strictly at the interface of the <b>clad</b> strip. The <b>clad</b> strip was not broken at the interface by the continuous bending. Research limitations/implications: Are that 100 mm width-strip was cast in the present study. Ability of the <b>clad</b> strip that is wider than 100 mm was not clear. The control of the <b>clad</b> ratio was not investigated. Practical implications: The twin roll caster devised and investigated in this report is useful to cast <b>clad</b> strip like the brazing sheet for the radiator of the automobile. Originality/value: The vertical type twin roll cater to cast <b>clad</b> strip is original process. The scriber was used to prevent the mixture of the two kinds of melts. The scriber was not used in the previous research to cast <b>clad</b> strip at the twin roll caster, and use of the scriber was the first try...|$|R
