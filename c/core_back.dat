60|$|Collective {{humanity}} owes a great debt {{of gratitude}} to the first potter. Before his days the art of boiling, though in one sense very simple and primitive indeed, was in another sense very complex, cumbersome, and lengthy. The unsophisticated savage, having duly speared and killed his antelope, proceeded to light a roaring fire, with flint or drill, {{by the side of}} some convenient lake or river in his tropical jungle. Then he dug a big hole in the soft mud close to the water's edge, and let the water (rather muddy) percolate into it, or sometimes even he plastered over its bottom with puddled clay. After that, he heated some smooth round stones red hot in the fire close by, and drawing them out gingerly between two pieces of stick, dropped them one by one, spluttering and fizzing, into his improvised basin or kettle. This, of course, made the water in the hole boil; and the unsophisticated savage thereupon thrust into it his joint of antelope, repeating the process over and over again until the sodden meat was completely seethed to taste on the outside. If one application was not sufficient, he gnawed off the cooked meat from the surface with his stout teeth, innocent as yet of the dentist's art, and plunged the underdone <b>core</b> <b>back</b> again, till it exactly suited his not over-delicate or dainty fancy.|$|E

Typical materials are a tungsten-rhenium target on a molybdenum <b>core,</b> <b>backed</b> with graphite. The rhenium makes the tungsten more ductile and resistant to wear from {{the impact of the}} electron beams. The molybdenum conducts heat from the target. The graphite provides thermal storage for the anode, and minimizes the rotating mass of the anode.|$|R

50|$|When {{stars in}} the 0.8-2.0 solar mass range exhaust the {{hydrogen}} in their cores and become red giants, the helium accumulating in their cores reaches degeneracy before it ignites. When the degenerate core reaches {{a critical mass of}} about 0.45 solar masses, helium fusion is ignited and takes off in a runaway fashion, called the helium flash, briefly increasing the star's energy production to a rate 100 billion times normal. About 6% of the core is quickly converted into carbon. While the release is sufficient to convert the <b>core</b> <b>back</b> into normal plasma after a few seconds, it does not disrupt the star, nor immediately change its luminosity. The star then contracts, leaving the red giant phase and continuing its evolution into a stable helium-burning phase.|$|E

Entering the ship, the Autobots fight off Soundwave and attempt to access the plasma core powering the Proudstar and the Insecticons, but the security system ejects the core from the ship. Emerging, the Autobots learn the core's location from Thundercracker and follow the trail. While they are distracted by fighting Blitzwing, Starscream arrives to take the <b>core</b> <b>back</b> to the Decepticons, but loses control of it due to a storm and crash-lands. The Autobots beat Motormaster to the core, but find it damaged and at risk of explosion. Before they can shut it down, {{the rest of the}} Stunticons arrive and form Menasor. The combiner throws the core to Megatron, who takes it to Cybertron to be properly repaired.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. According {{to current}} theories, tidal {{interactions}} between a disk and an embedded planet {{may lead to}} the rapid migration of the protoplanet on a timescale shorter than the disk lifetime or estimated planetary formation timescales. Therefore, planets can form only if there is a mechanism to hold {{at least some of the}} <b>cores</b> <b>back</b> on their way in. Once a giant planet has assembled, there also has to be a mechanism to prevent it from migrating down to the disk center. This paper reviews the different mechanisms that have been proposed to stop or slow down migration. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The Bow Tie model {{comprises}} {{four main}} groups of web pages. Like with the Jellyfish model {{there is a}} strongly connected core. There are then two other large groups, roughly of equal size. One consists of all pages that link to the strongly connected core, but which have no links from the <b>core</b> <b>back</b> out to them. This is the [...] "Origination" [...] or [...] "In" [...] group, as it contains links that lead into the core when originating from it. The counterpart to this is the group of all pages that the strongly connected core links to, but which have no links back into the core. This is the [...] "Termination" [...] or [...] "Out" [...] group, as it contains links that lead out of the core and terminate from it. The fourth and final group is all other disconnected pages, which neither link to the core nor are linked from it.|$|E
5000|$|The GHOUL, materializing in the core, {{shoots a}} blast of energy so powerful, it is off the charts of the Skeleton Crew's power reader. A part of Watcher's Nest {{along with a few}} laser posts are obliterated. Lyar Von Ertiana's rampart is {{partially}} damaged, and she loses contact with everyone one of the soldiers except Kiri. Lyar relays instructions for both of them to accelerate into the core. Meanwhile, Luxandra, is shown unconscious in her rampart armor {{on the surface of the}} <b>core,</b> <b>back</b> on the surface. She wakes up, and gains her surroundings. She is able to move the arm of the rampart armor, as she tries to get back up. A shadowed object is shown walking towards the rampart armor, none other than the GHOUL. It is shown trying to break in, while Luxandra is screaming. The GHOUL breaks in, and begins to eat her alive. The picture taken with all 4 of them together is covered in blood, and the blood that drips off of the rampart armor splashes onto her face, blotting her out of the picture. The GHOUL leaves the scene, and the Specular soon appears in the holding bay of the rampart armors.|$|E
5000|$|Aquatic {{therapy has}} been shown to improve muscle strength, {{especially}} in the <b>core,</b> <b>back,</b> and stifles, and to increase both cardiovascular condition and proprioception in horses. The underwater treadmill is a popular tool for equine rehabilitation, and can offer targeted therapy based on water depth. At lower depths, horses will pick their legs up out of the water to clear it in the flight phase of the stride. In this case, the depth may be adjusted to improve the range of motion of a specific joint, offering the option of customizing treatment to a particular injury. Higher depths can increase pelvic flexion and raising of the back, helping to strengthen muscles that are commonly used by riding horses, conditioning them without the added weight of a rider. High water levels can also reduce body mass, similar to the effects seen with swimming, and may be beneficial for joint injuries or fractures. However, the animal will develop muscular and cardiovascular fitness much faster that they will develop skeletal strength. This may make the horse appear to be better-prepared for strenuous work than it truly is, and early return to work may place the bones, joints, tendons, and ligaments at much greater risk of injury. Therefore, care must be taken to build up bone strength before the animal is placed into regular work under-saddle.|$|E

40|$|Drilling {{techniques}} and equipment used for retrieval and {{return of a}} 308 -m ice core from a remote area of China are discussed. High resolution climatic records from remote regions of the planet are possible only if the core is continuous and of high quality. In this instance retrieval of core from over 200 m below the firn ice transition required a switch of drill type from electromechanical to thermal. Working at extreme altitude and bringing the <b>core</b> <b>back</b> in a frozen state across one of the warmest regions on the planet placed additional burdens on equipment, personnel, and logistics. Solutions to these problems, improvements for future projects, and implications for retrieving continuous deep cores in regions with limited logistics are discussed...|$|E
