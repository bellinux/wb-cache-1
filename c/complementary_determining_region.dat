Based on a previous work, it has been identified that several residues located in the <b>complementary</b> <b>determining</b> <b>region</b> (CDR) of antibody fragment of FAB 23. 5 may serve as a potential point mutation modification in order to improve the binding interaction and the inhibitory activity between the single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody and the epitope variant of HIV- 1 p 24 capsid protein. In this study, several binding residues from the variable chain domain of scFv anti-p 24 were modified. The designed antibody along with the bound antigen was then subjected for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation by using PMEMD. CUDA under Amber 12 with NVIDIA ® Kepler ® GPUs system.

These restraints restrict the sampling space Rosetta searches in the torso domain, limiting the φ and ψ angles of these residues to conformations that have been experimentally observed.

First, {{the location of the}} <b>complementary</b> <b>determining</b> <b>regions</b> of the target sequences are automatically identified by a sequence alignment strategy against a database of TCR Va and Vb chains. A structure-based alignment ensures automated identification of CDR 3 loops. The CDR are then modeled in the environment of the complex, in an ab initio approach based on a simulated annealing protocol. During this step, dihedral restraints are applied to drive the CDR 1 and CDR 2 loops towards their canonical conformations, described by Al-Lazikani et. al. We developed a new automated algorithm that determines additional restraints to iteratively converge towards TCR conformations making frequent hydrogen bonds with the pMHC. We demonstrated that our approach outperforms popular scoring methods (Anolea, Dope and Modeller) in predicting relevant CDR conformations. Finally, this modeling approach has been successfully applied to experimentally determined sequences of TCR that recognize the NY-ESO- 1 cancer testis antigen. This analysis revealed a mechanism of selection of TCR through the presence of a single conserved amino acid in all CDR 3 b sequences.

High M-protein concentration {{is associated with a}} more oligoclonal IgG and IgA response at day 7 postvaccination, and, in contrast to HCs, vaccination also induced significant perturbations in the MGUS IgM repertoire at day 7 (p [0. 005). Monoclonal expansion in MGUS thus has an effect on the baseline B-cell repertoire and influences the recruited repertoire upon vaccination...|$|E

These clones have been assumed – but never demonstrated – to be similar in the three compartments. Addressing this key question is essential to infer the implication of peripheral clonally expanded CD 8 + T cells in the disease. MethodsFor the first time, TCR Vβ repertoire from paired blood (purified CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells), CSF and CNS (22 lesions, various inflammatory and demyelination statuses) samples from three MS patients was studied using <b>complementary</b> <b>determining</b> <b>region</b> 3 (CDR 3) spectratyping and high-throughput sequencing. In parallel, blood and CNS clonally expanded CD 8 + T cells were characterized by fluorescent staining. ResultsTCR Vβ repertoire analysis revealed strong sharing of predominant T-cell clones between CNS lesions, CSF, and blood CD 8 + T cells. In parallel, we showed that blood oligoclonal CD 8 + T cells exhibit characteristics of pathogenic cells, as they displayed a bias toward a memory phenotype in MS patients, with increased expression of CCR 5, CD 11 a and Granzyme B (GZM-B) compared to non oligoclonal counterparts. CNS-infiltrating T cells were mainly CD 8 expressing CD 11 a and GZM-B...|$|E
40|$|In {{meeting the}} high demand for {{monoclonal}} antibodies, the chicken immunoglobulin system was exploited to generate recombinant antibodies against multiple target antigens. Following simultaneous immunisation of two chickens {{with a mixture}} of Plasmodium falciparum recombinant lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), histidine rich protein II (HRPII) and aldolase (ALDO), recombinant trypanosome variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) and malignant catarrhal fever virus (MCFV) each chicken produced egg yolk antibodies (IgY) against four of the five antigens. Using phage display technology, two single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody libraries, one with the immunoglobulin VH and VL chain regions joined by a single amino acid (G) and the other with a 15 amino acid flexible linker [(G 4 S) 3] were constructed using pooled splenic RNA. The single amino acid-linked scFv repertoire was evaluated as a source of highly specific diagnostic antibodies by panning against each of the five different antigens. After two rounds of panning, polyclonal phage ELISA showed the presence of antigen-specific phage antibodies against three (LDH, HRPII and VSG) of the five antigens. Five different anti-LDH and six different anti-HRPII scFvs were identified by sequence analysis. Evidence of high levels of antigen-driven gene conversion events was found in the framework and <b>complementary</b> <b>determining</b> <b>regions</b> and the VL chain pseudogene donors were identified. Stability of the selected scFvs was determined by incubation at different times and at different temperatures. The specificity and potential use of an LDH-specific scFv as a diagnostic reagent was shown in sandwich and competitive inhibition ELISAs.

40|$|The {{extracellular}} {{domain of}} influenza A virus matrix protein 2 (M 2 e) is conserved {{and is being}} evaluated as a quasiuniversal in-fluenza A vaccine candidate. We describe the crystal structure at 1. 6 Å resolution of M 2 e in complex with the Fab fragment of an M 2 e-specific monoclonal antibody that protects against influenza A virus challenge. This antibody binds M 2 expressed on the surfaces of cells infected with influenza A virus. Five out of six <b>complementary</b> <b>determining</b> <b>regions</b> interact withM 2 e, and three highly conservedM 2 e residues are critical for this interaction. In this complex, M 2 e adopts a compact U-shaped conformation stabilized in the center by the highly conserved tryptophan residue inM 2 e. This is the first description of the three-dimensional structure of M 2 e. IMPORTANCE M 2 e of influenza A is under investigation as a universal influenza A vaccine, but its three-dimensional structure is unknown. We describe the structure of M 2 e stabilized with anM 2 e-specific monoclonal antibody that recognizes natural M 2. We found that the conserved tryptophan is positioned {{in the center of}} the U-shaped structure of M 2 e and stabilizes its conformation. The struc-ture also explains why previously reported in vivo escape viruses, selected with a similar monoclonal antibody, carried proline residue substitutions at position 10 inM 2. Matrix protein 2 (M 2) is a structural protein of influenza Aviruses and plays an important role in the virus life cycle...|$|R
40|$|Domain III of the dengue virus {{envelope}} protein (EDIII, aa 295 - 395) has an immunoglobulin fold {{and is the}} proposed receptor-binding domain of the virus. Previous {{studies have shown that}} monoclonal antibodies against EDIII can be neutralizing and have therapeutic potential. Here, cloned Fab-phage libraries of human and mouse origin were screened for DENV specific antibodies. Firstly, bacterially expressed EDIII or whole virus particles were used as bait in biopanning against a large naïve human Fab-phage library (> 10 billion independent clones). Multiple panning strategies were employed, and in excess of 1000 clones were screened, but all of the antibodies identified bound the envelope in regions outside EDIII suggesting EDIII antibodies are virtually absent from the naïve human repertoire. Next, a chimeric Fab-phage library was constructed from a panel of EDIII specific mouse hybridomas by pooling the VH and VL chain sequences from the hybridomas and cloning these into the pComb 3 X phagemid vector with human CH and CL encoding sequences. Biopanning against EDIII identified a unique antibody (C 9) that cross-reacts with EDIII from DENV 1 - 3 and, in the IgG format, binds and neutralizes DENV 2 in cell-based assays. Sequence analysis and saturation mutagenesis of <b>complementary</b> <b>determining</b> <b>regions</b> (CDR) in the C 9 light chain suggest an antigen recognition model in which the LCDR 3 is a key determinant of EDIII specificity, while modifications in LCDR 1 and LCDR 2 affect DENV serotype cross-reactivity. Overall, this study supports the current prevailing opinion that neutralizing anti-EDIII monoclonal antibodies can be readily generated in murine systems, but in humans the anti-DENV immune response is directed away from domain III...|$|R
