5|$|Despite Gormley's plea, {{removal of}} B of the Bang began in April 2009. More {{substantial}} hoarding was erected around {{the site and}} demolition firm Connell Brothers Limited began removing the spikes with oxyacetylene <b>cutting</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
5|$|The MOD {{commissioned}} {{a series of}} multi-beam sonar surveys to image the wreck and appraise its condition. The high-resolution sonograms showed Royal Oak to be lying almost upside down with her top works forced into the seabed. The tip of the bow had been blown off by U-47s first torpedo and a gaping hole on the starboard flank {{was the result of}} the triple strike from her second successful salvo. Following several years of delays, Briggs Marine was contracted by the MoD to conduct the task of pumping off the remaining oil. Royal Oaks mid-construction conversion to fuel oil had placed her fuel tanks in unconventional positions, complicating operations. By 2006, all double bottom tanks had been cleared and the task of removing oil from the inner wing tanks with cold <b>cutting</b> <b>equipment</b> began the next year. By 2010, some 1600 tonnes of fuel oil had been removed, and the wreck was declared to be no longer actively releasing oil into Scapa Flow. Operations continue at a reduced pace to tackle the oil known to be remaining (state for 2012).|$|E
5|$|Live BBC {{television}} coverage at 08:15 {{the following morning}} showed that although the whole train had been derailed, the rear carriages were standing nearly vertically on the sleepers and ballast. Standard class, the front five carriages, were the worst affected, and the rear four first class carriages were in better condition. The leading carriage, a driving motor coach, had headed down the embankment, and turned end-for-end as it fell. It was lying on its side {{at the foot of}} the embankment. The second carriage had jack-knifed against the first, breaking the coupling, and so had not followed it down the bank. This second carriage came to rest some distance further along the track, at a steep angle with one end in the air. The middle part of the train toppled sideways down the embankment. All the partially friction stir welded carriages remained structurally intact, with damage mainly confined to the crumple zones at their ends. None of the windows broke, and lighting remained in all the carriages. Most injuries occurred in the front two carriages. The driver, who had stayed at the controls (but had little option to move once the accident had started and had no prior indication of derailment), was trapped for about an hour while specialist <b>cutting</b> <b>equipment</b> was used to free him from his cab. The other three members of the crew were in the rear first class section of the train.|$|E

At approximately the same time, new body assembly tooling for low-floor buses was installed at its adjoining body fabrication facility. With these changes in place, NABI shifted the manufacturing of its metal-structured low-floor unfinished buses from Hungary to the same facility that had already begun manufacturing NABI’s standard-floor products in Alabama a few years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Polyvinyl {{chloride}} {{is formed}} in flat sheets {{in a variety}} of thicknesses and colors. As flat sheets, PVC is often expanded to create voids in the interior of the material, providing additional thickness without additional weight and minimal extra cost (see Closed-cell PVC foamboard). Sheets are cut using saws and rotary <b>cutting</b> <b>equipment.</b> Plasticized PVC is also used to produce thin, colored, or clear, adhesive-backed films referred to simply as vinyl. These films are typically cut on a computer-controlled plotter (see Vinyl cutter) or printed in a wide-format printer. These sheets and films are used to produce a wide variety of commercial signage products, including car body stripes and stickers.|$|E
25|$|The stereo {{image was}} not made up of fully {{discrete}} Left and Right channels; each channel's signal {{coming out of the}} cartridge contained a small amount of the signal from the other channel, with more crosstalk at higher frequencies. High-quality disc <b>cutting</b> <b>equipment</b> was capable of making a master disc with 30–40dB of stereo separation at 1,000Hz, but the playback cartridges had lesser performance of about 20 to 30dB of separation at 1000Hz, with separation decreasing as frequency increased, such that at 12kHz the separation was about 10–15dB. A common modern view is that stereo isolation must be higher than this to achieve a proper stereo soundstage. However, in the 1950s the BBC determined in a series of tests that only 20–25dB is required for the impression of full stereo separation.|$|E

25|$|The M2 {{was still}} busy between Junctions 1 and 4, and {{suffered}} from HGVs blocking the outside lane. In 2000 work began on widening the M2 from two lanes to four lanes. A {{joint venture between}} Costain, Skanska and Mowlem (CSM) created the company that would undertake the project. The project required the redesign of Junction 2 and Junction 3, and a second Medway Bridge. The existing bridge was converted to a four lane eastbound carriageway (including a hard shoulder). The new bridge formed the westbound carriageway. The entire stretch was lit with streetlights (the old section was not lit). The old Medway Bridge was physically narrowed by removing part of the footpath. High-pressure water <b>cutting</b> <b>equipment</b> was used to cut the concrete into manageable sections for disposal. There is only one path {{open to the public}} now.|$|E
500|$|The {{stations}} were demolished between 2001 and 2003. The smaller {{buildings and structures}} were first to be demolished. One worker was killed during the demolition work, in May 2001, crushed underneath an electrical connection box which fell from a wall. On 31 October 2001, the ash silo which stood at the ash dock was toppled using explosives to demolish the stilts the structure stood on. The silo was then dismantled by bulldozers. All of the smaller structures had been removed by July 2002. On 11 July 2002, the A Station's boiler house was demolished. The [...] high coal conveyor belt was demolished on 6 February 2003. The station's precipitators were demolished on 27 March and 17 April 2003. On 1 May 2003, the B Station's bunker bay building was demolished, and on 22 May 2003, the stations air heater was demolished. A fire started at the station on 17 June 2003, when a bunker caught fire after hot <b>cutting</b> <b>equipment</b> set fire to coke remnants. All of the larger structures had been demolished by July 2003. It was planned for the stations' chimneys to be demolished in October 2003, but {{that had to be}} postponed due to the complexity of the demolition. However, at noon on 7 December 2003, the four chimneys, each weighing , were demolished using a total of [...] of the industrial explosive Gelemex. The demolition is thought to have been the biggest chimney demolition in 50 years.|$|E

2500|$|Through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, various {{methods to}} improve the dynamic range of mass-produced records {{involved}} highly advanced disc <b>cutting</b> <b>equipment.</b> These techniques, marketed, to name two, as the CBS DisComputer and Teldec Direct Metal Mastering, were used to reduce inner-groove distortion. RCA Victor introduced another system to reduce dynamic range and achieve a groove with less surface noise under the commercial name of Dynagroove. Two main elements were combined: another disk material with less surface noise in the groove and dynamic compression for masking background noise. Sometimes this was called [...] "diaphragming" [...] the source material and not favoured by some music lovers for its unnatural side effects. Both elements were reflected in the brandname of Dynagroove, described elsewhere in more detail. It also used the earlier advanced method of forward-looking control on groove spacing with respect to volume of sound and position on the disk. Lower recorded volume used closer spacing; higher recorded volume used wider spacing, especially with lower frequencies. Also, the higher track density at lower volumes enabled disk recordings to end {{farther away from the}} disk center than usual, helping to reduce endtrack distortion even further.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the operation, facilities and management of public (Adama Hawassa and Mekelle) and private (Elfora Kombolcha) abattoirs in Ethiopia. Direct observation, photograph and discussion with the workers were used to collect information. The results of this study revealed that lairage was not divides into compartments to accommodate different classes and types of slaughter cattle in two of the four abattoirs visited. Stunning boxes were not used at many abattoirs investigated, enervation method of stunning was practiced and there were no means of sterilizing <b>cutting</b> <b>equipments.</b> Even though anti-and post mortem inspection were conducted properly at all abittoirs, findings were not regularly recorded in public abattoirs. Weighing scales were not available at the public abattoirs while live and carcasses weights were regularly recorded at the private abattoir. Carcass contamination occurred during processing and/or during transport in the public abattoirs. Classification of carcasses occurred not practiced in public or private abattoirs. It was concluded that the management practiced in public and private abattoirs can partly contributed to the poor beef quality produced. Hence it was recommended that the country should develop legislation governing the operation of abattoirs. Moreover, hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP) should be established in all abattoirs to ensure animal welfare, maximum efficiency and beef quality.
