This broad band THz <b>power</b> <b>meter</b> measures average <b>power</b> at ambient temperature and pressure, does not use a window, and is insensitive to polarization and time structure of THz radiation. The operation of the <b>power</b> <b>meter</b> {{is based on the}} calorimetric method: {{in order to determine the}} power of a beam of THz radiation, the beam is used to illuminate a highly absorbing surface with known BRDF characteristics until a stable temperature is reached. The power in the incident beam can then be determined by measuring the electric power needed to cause the sample temperature rise. The new <b>power</b> <b>meter</b> was used with laser calorimetry to measure the absorptivity, and thus the emissivity, of aluminum-coated silicon carbide mirror samples produced during the coating qualification run of the Herschel Space Observatory telescope to be launched by the European Space Agency in 2007. The samples were measured at 77 Kelvin to simulate the operating temperature of the telescope in its planned orbit around the second Lagrangian point, L 2, of the Earth-Sun system. The absorptivity of both clean and dust-contaminated samples was measured at 70, 118, 184 and 496 ?m and found to be in the range 0. 2 – 0. 8 %. Kavli Institute of NanoscienceApplied Science...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − Technical {{irregularities}} {{found in}} electrical <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> due to tampering, which {{are classified as}} fraud, {{are responsible for the}} most part of the energy loss experienced in the sector of electrical power distribution. The cost of energy theft is shared with all consumers in the form of non-technical losses. This work suits that context, by means of combating fraud in electric <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> in order to reduce losses due to the strengthening of effective punishment of cheaters. For that is proposed a systematization model of the process for verification of irregularities in electric <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> and the respective issuance of audit reports. The proposed systematization is based on a database containing standardized irregularities which were hierarchically arranged and also from information obtained from metrological calibration audits, thus ensuring the reliability of the results. The proposed model was tested in samples of tampered <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> provided by the electrical distribution utilities in southern Brazil.

40|$|AC <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> {{require both}} {{voltage and current}} to be sampled {{concurrently}} to obtain real, reactive, and apparent power. Typically, the two measurements are taken in close physical proximity and fed into a single <b>power</b> <b>metering</b> device. In this paper, we explore the viability of decoupling the voltage and current channels, and placing them in physically disparate locations. Such decoupling could ease the installation of metering infrastructure and enable new sensing scenarios. However, decoupling the voltage and current channels raises a new question: how should they be recombined? Of the various approaches, we propose the voltage channel be virtualized: a voltage sensor measures the voltage magnitude, frequency, and phase, typically near the root of a circuit branch. The extracted phase is time-stamped relative to a global clock and disseminated wirelessly, along with the magnitude and frequency measurements, to <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> throughout the network. The <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> synthesize a suitably scaled replica of the voltage waveform locally, based on the parameters reported by the voltage sensor, and combine it with locally-measured current readings. This paper demonstrates – through empirical characterization of the line voltages, a proof-of-concept <b>power</b> <b>meter</b> implementation, and house-scale evaluation – that the design holds promise and offers substantially lower measurement errors than other distributed <b>power</b> <b>metering</b> approaches for non-resistive loads...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Power</b> <b>meters</b> provide instant {{feedback}} to the rider about their performance and measure their actual output; heart rate monitors measure the physiological effect of effort and therefore ramp up more slowly.

In addition, <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> measure the force that moves the bike forward multiplied by the velocity, which is the desired goal. This has two significant advantages over heart rate monitors: 1) An athlete's heart rate may remain constant over the training period, yet their power output is declining, which they cannot detect with a heart rate monitor; 2) While an athlete who is not rested or not feeling entirely well may train at their normal heart rate, they are unlikely to be producing their normal power—a heart rate monitor will not reveal this, but a <b>power</b> <b>meter</b> will.
