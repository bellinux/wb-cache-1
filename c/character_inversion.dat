40|$|We {{predict a}} new class of {{three-dimensional}} topological insulators (TIs) in which the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can more effectively generate a large band gap at Γ point. The band gap of conventional TI such as Bi_ 2 Se_ 3 is mainly limited by two factors, the strength of SOC and, from electronic structure perspective, the band gap when SOC is absent. While the former is an atomic property, we find that the latter can be minimized in a generic rock-salt lattice model in which a stable crossing of bands at the Fermi level along with band <b>character</b> <b>inversion</b> occurs for a range of parameters in the absence of SOC. Thus, large-gap TI's or TI's comprised of lighter elements can be expected. In fact, we find by performing first-principle calculations that the model applies to a class of double perovskites A_ 2 BiXO_ 6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = Br, I) and the band gap is predicted up to 0. 55 eV. Besides, more detailed calculations considering realistic surface structure indicate that the Dirac cones are robust against the presence of dangling bond at the boundary with a specific termination.

40|$|The P 300 Speller is {{a common}} brain-computer {{interface}} communication system. There are many parallel lines of research underway to overcome the system's {{low signal to noise}} ratio and thereby improve performance, including using famous face stimuli and integrating language information into the classifier. While both have been shown separately to provide significant improvements, the two methods have not yet been implemented together to demonstrate that the improvements are complimentary. The goal of this study is therefore twofold. First, we aim to compare the famous faces stimulus paradigm with an existing alternative stimulus paradigm currently used in commercial systems (i. e., <b>character</b> <b>inversion).</b> Second, we test these methods with language model integration to assess whether different optimization approaches can be combined to further improve BCI communication. In offline analysis using a previously published particle filter method, famous faces stimuli yielded superior results to both standard and inverting stimuli. In online trials using the particle filter method, all 10 subjects achieved a higher selection rate when using the famous faces flashing paradigm than when using inverting flashes. The improvements achieved by these methods are therefore complementary and a combination yields superior results to either method implemented individually when tested in healthy subjects...|$|E
50|$|The rule arises {{because in}} a centrosymmetric point group, IR active modes, which must {{transform}} according to the same irreducible representation generated {{by one of the}} components of the dipole moment vector (x, y or z), must be of ungerade (u) symmetry, i.e. their <b>character</b> under <b>inversion</b> is -1, while Raman active modes, which transform according to the symmetry of the polarizability tensor (product of two coordinates), must be of gerade (g) symmetry since their <b>character</b> under <b>inversion</b> is +1. Thus, in the character table there is no irreducible representation that spans both IR and Raman active modes, and so there is no overlap between the two spectra.|$|R

40|$|ZnO {{ceramics}} doped with a {{small amount}} of Bi 2 O 3 and Sb 2 O 3 were prepared and their orientation-dependent etching patterns were analyzed. Three distinctive patterns produced by the oxidizing etchant HCl were observed: hexagonal etch pits on +C plane, triangular etch pits on prismatic plane, and hillocks of hexagonal pyramid on -C plane. From these results, the three-dimensional shape of etch pit could be suggested. The <b>character</b> of <b>inversion</b> boundary was also determined from the etching patterns. close 313...|$|R

50|$|Two same-sign orbitals have a {{constructive}} overlap forming a molecular orbital with {{the bulk of}} the electron density located between the two nuclei. This MO is called the bonding orbital and its energy is lower than that of the original atomic orbitals. A bond involving molecular orbitals which are symmetric with respect to rotation around the bond axis is called a sigma bond (σ-bond). If the phase changes, the bond becomes a pi bond (π-bond). Symmetry labels are further defined by whether the orbital maintains its original <b>character</b> after an <b>inversion</b> about its center; if it does, it is defined gerade, g. If the orbital does not maintain its original character, it is ungerade, u.|$|R
50|$|Carbon {{and each}} oxygen atom {{will have a}} 2s atomic orbital and a 2p atomic orbital, where the p orbital is divided into px, py, and pz. With these derived atomic orbitals, {{symmetry}} labels are deduced with respect to rotation about the principal axis which generates a phase change, pi bond (π) or generates no phase change, known as a sigma bond (σ). Symmetry labels are further defined by whether the atomic orbital maintains its original <b>character</b> after an <b>inversion</b> about its center atom; if the atomic orbital does retain its original character it is defined gerade,g, or if the atomic orbital does not maintain its original character, ungerade, u.

40|$|The {{adaptive}} <b>character</b> of <b>inversion</b> polymorphism in Drosophila subobscura is well established. The OST and O 3 + 4 chromosomal {{arrangements of}} this species differ by two overlapping inversions that arose independently on O 3 chromosomes. Nucleotide variation in eight gene regions distributed along inversion O 3 was analyzed in 14 OST and 14 O 3 + 4 lines. Levels of variation within arrangements were quite similar along the inversion. In addition, we detected (i) extensive genetic differentiation between arrangements in all regions, regardless of their distance to the inversion breakpoints; (ii) strong association between nucleotide variants and chromosomal arrangements; and (iii) high levels of linkage disequilibrium in intralocus and also in interlocus comparisons, extending over distances as great as ∼ 4 Mb. These results are {{not consistent with the}} higher genetic exchange between chromosomal arrangements expected in the central part of an inversion from double-crossover events. Hence, double crossovers were not produced or, alternatively, recombinant chromosomes were eliminated by natural selection to maintain coadapted gene complexes. If the strong genetic differentiation detected along O 3 extends to other inversions, nucleotide variation would be highly structured not only in D. subobscura, but also in the genome of other species with a rich chromosomal polymorphism...|$|R
40|$|The famous Kazhdan-Lusztig Conjecture of the 1970 s {{states that}} the {{multiplicity}} of an irreducible composition factor of a Verma module can be computed by evaluating Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials at 1. Thus {{the character of a}} Verma module is a linear combination of characters of irreducible highest weight modules where the coefficients in the linear combination are Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials evaluated at 1. Kazhdan-Lusztig showed that inverting and writing the character of an irreducible highest weight module as a linear combination of characters of Verma modules, the coefficients in the linear combination are also Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials evaluated at 1, up to a sign. In this paper, we show how to prove Kazhdan-Lusztig's <b>character</b> multiplicity <b>inversion</b> formula by induction using coherent continuation functors. Unitary representations may be identified by determining if characters and signature characters are the same. The signature character of a Verma module may be written as a linear combination of signature characters of irreducible highest weight modules where the coefficients in the linear combination are signed Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials evaluated at 1. An analogous argument by induction using coherent continuation functors proves an analogous multiplicity inversion formula for signature characters: the signature character of an irreducible highest weight module is a linear combination of signature characters of Verma modules where the coefficients, up to a sign, are also signed Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials evaluated at 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of the local Coulomb {{interaction}} on a topological band insulator (TBI) by applying the dynamical mean field theory to a generalized Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model having electron correlations. It is elucidated how the correlation effects modify electronic properties in the TBI phase at finite temperatures. In particular, the band <b>inversion</b> <b>character</b> of the TBI inevitably leads to the large reduction of the spectral gap via the renormalization effect, which results in the strong temperature-dependence of the spin Hall conductivity. We clarify that a quantum phase transition from the TBI to a trivial Mott insulator, if it is nonmagnetic, is of first order with a hysteresis. This is confirmed via the interaction dependence of the double occupancy and the spectral function. A magnetic instability is also addressed. All these results imply that the spectral gap does not close at the transition. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} J. M. Coetzee’s novel Waiting for the Barbarians {{is seen as}} {{fundamentally}} disrupting the binary logic that underpins colonial discourse. The binary constructs {{an image of the}} civilized, rational and good, and the primitive, irrational and evil on the opposite sides of a fixed border. In this novel, as well as in colonial reality, the binary dissolves into ambivalence, overlap and often complete inversion of the two opposed constructed identities. This paper analyses the novel Waiting for the Barbarians identifying as the most important themes - the ambivalence and inversion of colonial identity, which are seen as a reflex of the fear of the indigenous other. The analysis focuses on the motifs of vision and surveillance in the novel, and Lacan’s psychoanalytic notions of the gaze and the scopic drive. It is observed that these concepts figure prominently in the narrative by establishing ambivalent psychological relationships of power between the main characters, discovering ambivalence within the <b>characters</b> and the <b>inversion</b> of their constructed colonial identities...|$|R
40|$|The {{role that}} {{literature}} embedded with fairy and folk tale myths plays in identity formation has {{attracted the attention}} of both feminist and postmodern writers and critics. African American and Spanish women writers are concerned with the lack of literature fostering strong female models. These women are bonded by their journey to overcome the internalization of controlling patriarchal perceptions and images of women, like the repressive stereotypes that permeate literature, many of which are encoded in folk and fairy tale myths. ^ The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine how Toni Morrison and Rosa Montero use similar techniques to subvert and deconstructively rewrite the fairy tale icons of the heroine and the hero masquerading as real, thus underscoring the conflict between literature and reality. I focus on their use of binary oppositional <b>characters,</b> mirrors, <b>inversions,</b> and metafiction, to deconstruct the stereotypical roles of both men and women, underscoring the role that literature plays in creating self-identity problems when women try to imitate fictional characters. The reader is forced to reexamine literary icons and their role in the real world. ^ The introduction places into perspective the role that fairy and folk tale myths have in the formation of stereotyping and the effect of patriarchal society on the individual 2 ̆ 7 s achievement and retention of an integrated, acceptable self. After identifying the aspects of the narratology in chapter one, I begin the textual analysis of Tar Baby. In chapter two, I apply Patricia Hill Collins 2 ̆ 7 and bell hooks 2 ̆ 7 theories on the underlying system of objectification and domination to Te trataré como a una reina. In chapters three and four I explore how The Bluest Eve and Bella y oscura respectively probe the African American and Spanish women 2 ̆ 7 s sense of helplessness, its connection to father/daughter dependency, and the role of fairy tales in the formation of this relationship. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{species in}} the repleta group of the genus Drosophila have been placed into five {{subgroup}}s—the mulleri, hydei, mercatorum, repleta, and fasciola subgroups. Each subgroup has been further subdivided into complexes and clusters. Extensive morphological and cytological analyses {{of the members of}} this species group have formed the foundation for the proposed relationships among the members of the repleta species group. Fifty-four taxa, including 46 taxa belonging to the repleta species group, were sequenced for fragments of four genes— 16 S ribosomal DNA (16 S), cytochrome oxidase II (COII), and nitrogen dehydrogenase 1 (ND 1) of the mitochondrial genome and a region of the hunchback (hb) nuclear gene. We also generated a partial data set of elongation factor 1 -alpha (Ef 1 �) sequences for a subset of taxa. Our analysis used both DNA <b>characters</b> and chromosomal <b>inversion</b> data. The phylogenetic hypothesis we obtained supports many of the traditionally accepted clades within the mulleri subgroup, but the monophyly of taxonomic groups outside of this subgroup appears not to be supported. Phylogenetic analysis revealed one well-supported, highly resolved clade that consists of closely related members of the mulleri and buzzatii complexes. The remaining taxa, a wide assortment of taxonomic groups, ranging from members of other species groups to members of several subgroups and members of three species complexes from the mulleri subgroup are found in poorly supported arrangements {{at the base of the}} tree. © 2000 Academic Pres...|$|R
40|$|Inversion {{effect is}} also known in TRIZ as “The other way around ” (1). We put here main {{classification}} of inversion “approach ” taken from July 1997 -year issue of TRIZ Journal- Principle 13 : A. Invert the action(s) used {{to solve the problem}} (e. g. instead of cooling an object, heat it). o To loosen stuck parts, cool the inner part instead of heating the outer part. o Bring the mountain to Mohammed, instead of bringing Mohammed to the mountain. B. Make movable parts (or the external environment) fixed, and fixed parts movable). o Rotate the part instead of the tool. o Moving sidewalk with standing people o Treadmill (for walking or running in place) C. Turn the object (or process) 'upside down'. o Turn an assembly upside down to insert fasteners (especially screws). o Empty grain from containers (ship or railroad) by inverting them. Before discussing applications of Inversion approach in construction, we would like to discuss some inversion effects, which were “puzzling ” us during our inventing practice. In some cases inversion effect could bring … problems, as it had place during measuring density of Moon’s soil with nuclear gauges by Soviet Automatic Station Moon- 16. By results of these measurements density of Moon’s Soil could be 1. 6 or 2. 3 gram/sm 3. Being professionally connected with nuclear technique, we analyzed this situation. Measurements of the density had been done by scattering of gamma quanta by electrons, which surrounding atoms of Moon soil constituents. When density of soil increases, the amount of scattered quanta also increases, and is registered by a gamma counter located on definite distance from source of gamma radiation. Starting from some density, the energy of gamma “particles ” starts reducing due to consequent scattering; and finally soil’s constituents absorb them. The changes of scattering gamma quanta flux is shown in Fig. 1 and has <b>inversion</b> <b>character...</b>|$|R
