5|$|The ASD also {{includes}} the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) {{which is responsible for}} protecting Defence and other Australian Government agencies against <b>cyberwarfare</b> attacks. The ACSC was established in January 2010 and is jointly staffed by the DSD and personnel from the Attorney-General's Department, Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, and Australian Federal Police. Unlike the United States military, the ADF does not class <b>cyberwarfare</b> as being a separate sphere of warfare. In July 2017 an Information Warfare Division was raised, tasked with both defensive and offensive cyber operations.|$|E
5|$|At the 2014 Wales summit, {{the leaders}} of NATO's member states reaffirmed their pledge to spend the {{equivalent}} of at least 2% of their gross domestic products on defense. In 2015, five of its 28 members met that goal. On 15 June 2016, NATO officially recognized <b>cyberwarfare</b> as an operational domain of war, just like land, sea and aerial warfare. This means that any cyber attack on NATO members can trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Montenegro became the 29th and newest member of NATO on 5 June 2017, amid strong objections from Russia.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, the USAF {{tendered}} {{an offer}} for security services {{to protect the}} Saudi air force from <b>cyberwarfare</b> attacks.|$|E

The DGFI has been involved in most paramilitary operations as well as counter-terrorism and <b>cyberwarfare.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stuxnet, {{discovered}} by Sergey Ulasen, initially spread via Microsoft Windows, and targeted Siemens industrial control systems. While {{it is not}} the first time that hackers have targeted industrial systems, nor the first publicly known intentional act of <b>cyberwarfare</b> to be implemented, it is the first discovered malware that spies on and subverts industrial systems, and the first to include a programmable logic controller (PLC) rootkit.|$|E
25|$|The Political Action Group (PAG) is {{responsible}} for covert activities related to political influence, psychological operations and economic warfare. The rapid development of technology has added <b>cyberwarfare</b> to their mission.

25|$|Nance placed {{utilization}} of propaganda by Russian intelligence agencies through Russia Today and other outlets including social media {{as part of}} a larger effort at global <b>cyberwarfare.</b> He characterized this a form of hybrid warfare blending traditional propaganda with computer tools and subversion of media organizations. As a case study he cited Russian political scientist with views favored by Putin, Aleksandr Dugin, who exemplified on Twitter perspectives that U.S democratic institutions were not successful.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Defence and the Defence Forces {{have been}} working on a <b>cyberwarfare</b> and defence {{formation}} for some years now. In 2007, a military doctrine of an e-military of Estonia was officially introduced as the country was under massive cyberattacks in 2007. The proposed aim of the e-military is to secure the vital infrastructure and e-infrastructure of Estonia. The main cyber warfare facility is the Computer Emergency Response Team of Estonia (CERT), founded in 2006. The organisation operates on security issues in local networks.|$|E
25|$|On December 9, 2016, Obama {{ordered the}} U.S. Intelligence Community to {{investigate}} Russian {{interference in the}} election and report before he left office on January 20, 2017. U.S. Homeland Security Advisor and chief counterterrorism advisor to the president Lisa Monaco announced the study, and said foreign intrusion into a U.S. election was unprecedented and would necessitate investigation by subsequent administrations. The intelligence analysis would cover malicious <b>cyberwarfare</b> occurring between the 2008 and 2016 elections. CNN reported that an unnamed senior administration official {{told them that the}} White House was confident Russia interfered in the election. The official said the order by President Obama would be a lessons learned report, with options including sanctions and covert cyber response against Russia.|$|E
25|$|In a December 15, 2016 {{interview}} by NPR journalist Steve Inskeep, Obama said the U.S. government {{would respond to}} Russia via overt and covert methods, in order to send an unambiguous symbol {{to the world that}} any such interference would have harsh consequences. He added that motive behind the Russian operation could better be determined after completion of the intelligence report he ordered. Obama emphasized that Russian efforts caused more harm to Clinton than to Trump during the campaign. At a press conference the following day, he highlighted his September 2016 admonition to Putin to cease engaging in <b>cyberwarfare</b> against the U.S. Obama explained that the U.S. did not publicly reciprocate against Russia's actions due to a fear such choices would appear partisan. President Obama minimized conflict between his administration and the Trump transition, stressing cyber warfare against the U.S. should be a bipartisan issue.|$|E
25|$|On December 29, 2016, the U.S. {{government}} announced {{a series of}} punitive measures against Russia. The Obama administration imposed sanctions on four top officials of the GRU and declared persona non grata 35 Russian diplomats suspected of spying; they were ordered {{to leave the country}} within 72 hours. On December 30, two waterfront compounds used as retreats by families of Russian embassy personnel were shut down on orders of the U.S. government, citing spying activities: one in Upper Brookville, New York, on Long Island, and the other in Centreville, Maryland, on the Eastern Shore. Further sanctions against Russia were undertaken, both overt and covert. A White House statement said that <b>cyberwarfare</b> by Russia was geared to undermine U.S. trust in democracy and impact the election. President Obama said his decision was taken after previous warnings to Russia. In mid-July 2017, the Russian foreign ministry said the U.S. was refusing to issue visas to Russian diplomats to allow Moscow to replace the expelled personnel and get its embassy back up to full strength.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to Operation Pillar of Defense, a November 2012 Israeli military {{operation in the}} Gaza Strip, Anons took down hundreds of Israeli websites with DDoS attacks. Anons pledged another [...] "massive cyberassault" [...] against Israel in April 2013 in retaliation for its actions in Gaza, promising to [...] "wipe Israel off {{the map of the}} Internet". However, its DDoS attacks caused only temporary disruptions, leading <b>cyberwarfare</b> experts to suggest that the group had been unable to recruit or hire botnet operators for the attack.|$|E
500|$|The Distinguished Warfare Medal was {{a planned}} United States {{military}} decoration announced by former U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta on 13 February 2013. [...] It {{would have been}} the first American combat-related award to be created since the Bronze Star Medal in 1944. [...] The blue, red and white-ribboned medal was to be awarded to individuals for [...] "extraordinary achievement" [...] related to a military operation occurring after 11 September 2001. [...] It was intended to recognize military achievement in <b>cyberwarfare</b> or combat drone operations for actions that did not include valor in combat.|$|E
500|$|Farrell takes McClane {{to fellow}} hacker Frederick [...] "Warlock" [...] Kaludis. Running several {{generators}} {{to keep his}} computer systems online, Warlock identifies the piece of code Farrell wrote {{as a means to}} access data at a master Social Security Administration building at Woodlawn, Maryland. They realize the building is actually a NSA facility intended to backup the nation's entire personal and financial records {{in the event of a}} cyber attack, designed by Gabriel himself when he worked for the NSA. Warlock tells McClane and Matt that Gabriel is an extremely talented programmer and top security expert for the U.S. Department of Defense. Gabriel tried to alert the political and military leadership to critical weaknesses that made America's network infrastructure vulnerable to <b>cyberwarfare,</b> but his unorthodox methods led to his dismissal. Warlock runs a traceroute and manages to identify Gabriel's location, but Gabriel detects the intrusion.|$|E
500|$|On 25 August 2012, {{the plan}} to order was {{confirmed}} by both Swedish and Swiss authorities. Deliveries were expected to run from 2018 to 2021 at a fixed price of CHF 3.126 billion (US$3.27 billion) including development costs, mission planning systems, initial spares and support, training, and certification; the Swedish government also guaranteed the price, performance and operational suitability. 8 JAS 39Cs and 3 JAS 39Ds were to be leased from 2016 to 2020 to train Swiss pilots and allow the F-5s to be retired. In 2013, Saab moved to increase Swiss industry offsets above 100% of the deal value after the Swiss parliament's upper house voted down the deal's financing. [...] On 27 August 2013, the National Council's Security Commission approved the purchase, followed by the lower and upper houses of the parliament's approval in September 2013. [...] Elements of the left and center {{of the political spectrum}} often criticized the Gripen as unnecessary and too expensive. [...] On 18 May 2014, 53.4% of Swiss voters voted against the plan in a national referendum. According to the press, objectors questioned the role of fighter aircraft in general, and the relevance of alternatives such as UAVs, surface-to-air missiles, or <b>cyberwarfare</b> capabilities.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, in [...] "Cyberwar to Defend Democracy", Nance reiterates {{that the}} U.S. {{was the target}} of <b>cyberwarfare</b> by Russian {{intelligence}} agencies GRU and FSB, as directly ordered by Putin. Nance writes that Russia succeeded in casting doubt of citizens in the strength of U.S. democracy. He posits that, were the U.S. populace at large to internalize future acts of <b>cyberwarfare</b> as dangerous attempts to subvert daily life, they could lead to actual war itself.|$|E
2500|$|Western {{countries}} have long accused China of aggressive espionage, but although officials and organisations have traced various attacks on corporate and infrastructure computer systems {{in their countries}} to computers in China [...] "It {{is nearly impossible to}} know whether or not an attack is government-sponsored because of the difficulty in tracking true identities in cyberspace" [...] and China has denied accusations of <b>cyberwarfare,</b> and has accused the United States of engaging in <b>cyberwarfare</b> against it - which the US government in turn denies.|$|E
2500|$|Chinese Information Operations and Information Warfare {{includes}} {{the concept of}} “network warfare”, roughly analogous to the United States concept of <b>cyberwarfare.</b> Foreign Policy [...] magazine puts the size of China's [...] "hacker army" [...] at anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 individuals.|$|E
2500|$|China {{has denied}} accusations of <b>cyberwarfare,</b> and has accused the United States of {{engaging}} in <b>cyberwarfare</b> against it, accusations which the United States denies. Wang Baodong of the Chinese Embassy in the United States responded that the accusations {{are a result of}} sinophobic paranoia. He states that, [...] "China would never do anything to harm sovereignty or security of other countries. In conformity with such national policies, the Chinese government has never employed, nor will it employ so-called civilian hackers in collecting information or intelligence of other countries. Allegations against China in this respect are totally unwarranted, which only reflect the dark mentality of certain people who always regard China as a threat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an August 2014 interview, Snowden for {{the first}} time {{disclosed}} a <b>cyberwarfare</b> program in the works, codenamed MonsterMind, that would automate detection of a foreign cyberattack as it began and automatically fire back. [...] "These attacks can be spoofed," [...] said Snowden. [...] "You could have someone sitting in China, for example, making it appear that one of these attacks is originating in Russia. And then we end up shooting back at a Russian hospital. What happens next?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the documentary, Sweeney {{interviews}} {{intelligence and}} security analysts including John E. McLaughlin and Malcolm Nance, individuals with prior ties to Putin such as Aleksandr Dugin, and British and Russian political analysts including Roger Stone and Konstantin Kosachev. The documentary analyzes potential damaging information about Trump from the Donald Trump–Russia dossier, and asseses whether Russian intelligence has blackmail {{in the form}} of kompromat which they could use to manipulate him. The film describes Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and discusses whether Russian <b>cyberwarfare</b> impacted the elections. Finally, the documentary posits how a potential fallout between Trump and Putin could impact worldwide national security.|$|E
2500|$|Kenneth J. Bernstein {{wrote for}} Daily Kos [...] "to {{convince}} {{you to read}} this important book", he echoed the warning in its conclusion about the dangers posed by <b>cyberwarfare.</b> Bernstein wrote that the book's argumentation was strengthened because, [...] "Every single assertion Nance offers is backed by material ... clearly documented in end notes". Bernstein wrote favorably in addition of the book's foreword by The Guardian editor for national security, Spencer Ackerman. Italian language newspaper La Stampa called the book [...] "molto bello". Writing for The Independent, Andy Martin, commented, [...] "I suppose the only weak spot in the subtitle is the word 'tried'. Surely they did more than 'try'?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Tranche 3 {{aircraft}} ESM/ECM enhancements {{have been}} focused on improving radiating jamming power with antenna modifications, while EuroDASS is reported to offer a range of new capabilities, including {{the addition of a}} digital receiver, extending band coverage to low frequencies (VHF/UHF) and introducing an interferometric receiver with extremely precise geolocation functionalities. On the jamming side, EuroDASS is looking to low-band (VHF/UHF) jamming, more capable antennae, new ECM techniques, while protection against missile, is to be enhanced through a new passive MWS in addition to the active devices already on board the aircraft.

2500|$|On January 6, 2017, {{after meeting}} with members of U.S. {{intelligence}} agencies, Trump released a statement saying: <b>cyberwarfare</b> had {{no impact on the}} election and did not harm voting machines. In the same statement, he vowed to form a national cybersecurity task force to prepare an anti-hacking plan within 90 days of taking office. Referring to the Office of Personnel Management data breach in 2015, Trump told The New York Times he was under a [...] "political witch hunt", and wondered why there was no focus on China. Two days later, Reince Priebus reported that Trump had begun to acknowledge that [...] "entities in Russia" [...] were involved in the DNC leaks. On January 11, 2017, Trump conceded that Russia was probably the source of the leaks, although he also said it could have been another country.|$|E
2500|$|Republican U.S. Senators stated {{they planned}} to hold {{hearings}} and investigate Russian influence on the 2016 U.S. elections. By doing so they went against the preference of incoming Republican President-elect Trump, who downplayed Russian interference. Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain and Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr planned investigations of Russian <b>cyberwarfare.</b> U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker planned a 2017 investigation. Senator Lindsey Graham indicated he would conduct an investigation during the 115th Congress. On December 11, 2016, top-ranking bipartisan members of the U.S. Senate issued a joint statement responding to the intelligence assessments about Russia's influence on the election. The two Republican signers were Senators Graham and McCain, both members of the Armed Services Committee; the two Democratic signers were incoming Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Senator Jack Reed, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee.|$|E
2500|$|The Taiwanese Strait Crisis has led China {{to blame}} the United States for any issues that arise in the {{bilateral}} relationship between China and Taiwan, as they believe that American support of Taiwan {{is an effort to}} weaken their country. Relations became severely strained by the NATO Bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999, which was blamed on an intelligence error but which some Chinese believed to be deliberate. Recently, in 2009, Luo Ping, a director-general at the China Banking Regulatory Commission, criticized America's laissez-faire capitalism and said that he hated America when the United States Treasury would start to print money and depreciate the value of the U.S. dollar, thus cheapening the value of China's purchase of U.S. bonds. Chinese hackers have also conducted extensive <b>cyberwarfare</b> against American institutions and citizens targeting the U.S. and its Western allies. Furthermore, China's leaders present their country {{as an alternative to the}} meddling power of the West. In 2013, 54% of the Chinese had a [...] "very unfavorable" [...] or [...] "somewhat unfavorable" [...] view of Americans and 53% viewed the U.S. in a [...] "very unfavorable" [...] or [...] "somewhat unfavorable" [...] light.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 June, {{the group}} {{announced}} it had {{teamed up with}} Anonymous for [...] "Operation Anti-Security". They encouraged supporters to hack into, steal, and publish classified government information from any source while leaving the term [...] "Antisec" [...] as evidence of their intrusion. Also listed as potential targets were major banks. USA Today characterized the operation as an open declaration of <b>cyberwarfare</b> against big government and corporations. Their first target of the operation was the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), a national law enforcement agency of the United Kingdom. LulzSec claimed to have taken the website offline at about 11am EST on 20 June 2011, though it only remained down for a few minutes. While the attack {{appeared to be a}} DDoS attack, LulzSec tweeted that actual hacking was taking place [...] "behind the scenes". At about 6:10pm EST on 20 June, SOCA's website went down yet again. SOCA's website was back online sometime between 20 and 21 June. The website of the local district government of Jianhua District in Qiqihar, China, was also knocked offline. Early in the morning on 22 June, it was revealed that LulzSec's [...] "Brazilian unit" [...] had taken down two Brazilian government websites, [...] and [...] They also brought down the website of Brazilian energy company Petrobras.|$|E
2500|$|SAD, {{like most}} of the CIA, {{requires}} a bachelor's degree to be considered for employment. Many have advanced degrees such as Master's and law degrees.

[...] SAD officers are trained at Camp Peary, Virginia (also known as [...] "The Farm") and at privately owned training centers around the United States. They also train its personnel at [...] "The Point" [...] (Harvey Point), a facility outside of Hertford, North Carolina. [...] In addition to the eighteen months of training in the Clandestine Service Trainee (CST) Program required to become a clandestine intelligence officer, Paramilitary Operations Officers are trained to a high level of proficiency in the use and tactical employment of an unusually wide degree of modern weaponry, explosive devices and firearms (foreign and domestic), hand to hand combat, high performance/tactical driving (on and off road), apprehension avoidance (including picking handcuffs and escaping from confinement), improvised explosive devices, <b>cyberwarfare,</b> covert channels, HAHO/HALO parachuting, combat and commercial SCUBA and closed circuit diving, proficiency in foreign languages, surreptitious entry operations (picking or otherwise bypassing locks), vehicle hot-wiring, Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE), extreme survival and wilderness training, combat EMS medical training, tactical communications, and tracking.|$|E
2500|$|Israel, through Unit 8200, {{has been}} speculated to be the country behind Stuxnet in many media reports and by experts such as Richard A. Falkenrath, former Senior Director for Policy and Plans within the US Office of Homeland Security. Yossi Melman, who covers {{intelligence}} for the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz and {{is writing a book}} about Israeli intelligence, also suspected that Israel was involved, noting that Meir Dagan, the former (up until 2011) head of the national intelligence agency Mossad, had his term extended in 2009 because he was said to be involved in important projects. Additionally, Israel now expects that Iran will have a nuclear weapon in 2014 or 2015 – at least three years later than earlier estimates – without the need for an Israeli military attack on Iranian nuclear facilities; [...] "They seem to know something, that they have more time than originally thought", he added. Israel has not publicly commented on the Stuxnet attack but confirmed that <b>cyberwarfare</b> is now among the pillars of its defense doctrine, with a military intelligence unit set up to pursue both defensive and offensive options. When questioned whether Israel was behind the virus in the fall of 2010, some Israeli officials broke into [...] "wide smiles", fueling speculation that the government of Israel was involved with its genesis. American presidential advisor Gary Samore also smiled when Stuxnet was mentioned, although American officials have indicated that the virus originated abroad. According to The Telegraph, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that a video celebrating operational successes of Gabi Ashkenazi, retiring IDF Chief of Staff, was shown at his retirement party and included references to Stuxnet, thus strengthening claims that Israel's security forces were responsible.|$|E
