Pauli Murray was deeply affected by her experience working on the case and was inspired to pursue her career in <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>law.</b> Governor Darden, influenced by the popular sentiment that the case had evoked, began a reform of the Virginia penal system, including the creation of an official Pardon and Parole Board with the authority to commute sentences.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{co-operation}} in the AFL-CIO merger, Meany and Reuther had {{a contentious}} relationship for many years. In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, {{a major event}} {{in the history of}} the civil rights movement in the United States. Meany opposed AFL-CIO endorsement of the march. In an AFL-CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther's motion for a strong endorsement of the march was supported by only A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the titular leader of the march. The AFL-CIO endorsed a <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> and allowed individual unions to endorse the march. When Meany heard Randolph's speech after the march, he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen labor unions among African Americans and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that he was sure that Meany was morally opposed to racism.|$|E

25|$|The Slaughter-House Cases, , was {{the first}} United States Supreme Court {{interpretation}} of the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment which had recently been enacted. It was a pivotal case in early <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> and held that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the privileges or immunities of citizenship of the United States, not privileges and immunities of citizenship of a state. However, federal rights of citizenship were then few, such {{as the right to}} travel between states and to use navigable rivers; the amendment did not protect the far broader range of rights covered by state citizenship. In effect, the amendment was interpreted to convey limited protection pertinent to a small minority of rights.|$|E

In State of Nebraska v. Peony Park, the Nebraska Supreme Court found that two African-American participants were illegally barred from the meet because Peony Park barred them from the pool. On September 7, 1955, the court fined Peony Park $50 and costs of the trial. Additional civil suits were settled out of court.

As it was previously rare for alumni to go into government, Boston Globe journalist Charlie Savage suggested that the appointment of Office of Personnel Management director Kay Coles James, the former dean of Regent's government school, caused this sharp increase in Regent alumni employed in the government. An article about a Regent graduate who interviewed for a government position and Regent's low school rankings were cited {{as an example of the}} Bush administration hiring applicants with strong conservative credentials but weaker academic qualifications and less <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> experience than past candidates in the Civil Rights Division. In addition to Savage, several other commentators made similar assertions.
