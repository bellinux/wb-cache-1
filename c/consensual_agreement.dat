This Article radically shifts the municipal recovery debate by arguing that state law is the centralized point at which officials can exert the necessary amount of pressure to gain concessions from key creditor constituencies. To that end, I propose a comprehensive fiscal monitoring system that identifies and then directs distressed municipalities into a dynamic negotiation model designed to restructure inveterate debt obligations.

More specifically, through a consideration of three Australian politically-focused blogs-Larvatus Prodeo (group-authored blog), Andrew Bolt (sole-authored blog by a conservative commentator), and Andrew Bartlett (sole-authored blog by a former Australian Democrats Senator) -we argue that such fora can indeed inform and enable the public sphere deliberation important for democracy. We found that although blog participants might not evidently come to rational and <b>consensual</b> <b>agreements,</b> they are debating issues of public concern, and can take part in exchanges that facilitate deliberation. In our conception, deliberation is not necessarily invalidated by either the lack of any tangible outcome, or the fact that any outcomes reached are only partial and contingent, open to revision.

40|$|Investor-State {{arbitration}} {{cases involving}} public interest regulation have been understood as struggles between {{advocates of the}} free movement of investment capital, such as multinational corporations, and environmental or human rights interest groups. The critical questions have been framed as follows: should the competing values and interests in public interest regulatory disputes be reconciled through investor-State arbitration? Should arbitrators be permitted to incorporate non-investment international norms into investment law and interpret investment treaties by applying international law generally? Is the development of international law better served by States, as representatives of their peoples, determining the balance of protection and costs by concluding <b>consensual</b> <b>agreements</b> through political processes? These are questions of institutional competence and democratic legitimacy, the allocation of decision making authority among States and the various available investor-State arbitration rules and institutions. The manner in which these questions have been addressed in the existing literature suggests a genealogy based on the following three “models” of how public interest issues might be integrated into investor-State arbitration: 1) the contract model; 2) the institutional capacity building model; and 3) the arbitral activist model. The primary argument {{of this paper is}} that the first two models, namely the contract model and the institutional capacity building model, eventually fall-back on the third model, namely the arbitral activist model, implicating arbitral activism and necessitating that the investor-State arbitral system develops indigenous principles of systemic self-governance...|$|R

The workshop {{was part of a}} European research project studying the advantages and limitations of different participatory methods {{in the context of the}} Water Framework Directive. It involved policy makers, scientists, business representatives, and citizens from different parts of the island. On the first day, participants worked to envision a sustainable development future for the island and its water resources. Discussion was inspired by four alternative water development scenarios prepared by the organizers. Participants' vision statements emphasized a diversified development path and balanced water solutions. On the second day, participants worked to plan the actions needed to realize their common vision. The SW turned out to be a good method to initiate a multipartner dialogue, to include new stakeholders in the water policy debate, and to a certain extent, to promote learning between participants. On the other hand, it did not appear well suited to resolve conflicts and aid decisions in the face of scientific complexity and uncertainty. SW seems to be a good method for the "upstream," preparatory, capacity-building tasks of a planning process but not for the production of substantive decision outputs such as <b>consensual</b> <b>agreements</b> or action plans.

40|$|Research PaperFisheries {{exploited}} under open-access conditions create externalities, {{resulting in}} a range of problems associated with over-capitalisation and stock depletion. One answer to this is to shift the mode of production away from hunting and towards husbandry, an approach which becomes feasible where some control can be exercised over the resource and the harvesting pressure to which it is subject. Physical structures in the form of artificial reefs make such control a practical possibility, but the way these might be managed so as to support a sustainable fishery is by no means obvious. To investigate this further, the views of commercial fishermen who use the artificial reefs in the Algarve region of Portugal were canvassed and their opinions sought specifically on the prospects for co-management. In general, it was found that {{for each of the three}} different geographical areas where the ARs were deployed, there were different views on the establishment of management measures. The reasons for this may be related to the fact that each skipper had different incentives, once they were subjected to different fishing conditions (e. g. target species, fishing area and hauls, gear, vessel, crew, etc). Different fishing incentives reflect no <b>consensual</b> <b>agreements</b> in terms of possible management measures to adopt. However, a trade-off solution could be obtained for both area closure and users, and the use of scientific expertise consultancy (e. g. weight-length studies for the target species found in each reef area) could help managers in the establishment of an adequate measure to be adopted for the season closure option...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{planning}} {{such as the}} Local Agenda 21 (LA 21) {{launched by}} United Nations in the Summit of Rio de Janeiro in 1992, has been increasingly used as a new strategy of urban governance without challenging the mainstream patterns of economic growth and representative democracy. This kind of planning focuses on sustainable issues of both cities and global spaces by means of public debate, citizen involvement and <b>consensual</b> <b>agreements.</b> Along the last decade, the European Union has supported and funded many of these planning processes {{based on the assumption}} that they will improve urban sustainability and citizen participation. Nevertheless, we think that the supposed new styles of urban governance and citizen participation implied by LA 21 processes do not change substantially the pluralist and elitist ways of urban governability. What we have discovered due to the comparative analysis of two cases of successful LA 21, one in Portugal and one in Spain, is that citizen participation was not so plural as expected, and had little consequences for the improvement of participatory democracy and urban sustainability. Based on in-depth interviews and documents, our assessment of these two LA 21 processes also shows that local politics -such as the cycles of mobilization and the social networks around public services- and supra-local contexts -such as the ways of management conflicts and EU funds by one euroregional lobby- are relevant for explaining the apparent success of citizen participation in these two cities. Finally, we indicate several social conflicts which were disrupting the whole processes. Thus, we conclude by pointing out the methods and contexts of the actual implementation of LA 21 in order to explain why, in practice, citizen participation was conducted more by the action of authorities and managers than by the citizens who were involved in such a process.

40|$|UnrestrictedNowadays, {{driven by}} {{industry}} globalization and Internet revolution, modern software design {{is a group}} decision-making process which is often carried out {{by a team of}} stakeholders across geographical, disciplinary and temporal boundaries. These stakeholders have to negotiate collaboratively to achieve <b>consensual</b> <b>agreements</b> on their design decisions based on their competing objectives and different preferences. The identification, organization and negotiation of these objectives and preferences need to be well handled by the software design teams. To effectively support collaborative negotiation of group decisions, one of the critical requirements is to structure the negotiation arguments of multiple decision makers for multiple decision tasks, in order {{to make sure that all}} stakeholders have a common ground to effectively make rational group decisions for software design process.; To satisfy this requirement, our approach is to develop a new framework of organizing objectives and preferences and structuring the arguments using this organized information. This framework is built based on a synthesis between an objective hierarchy and a generic argument structure. Enabled by this synthesis framework, our approach specifies how the arguments can be generated based on stakeholders’ proposals, objectives, criteria and preferences, and then exchanged amongst multiple stakeholders. This synthesis framework also helps us build the systematic models of analyzing the arguments relationship and evaluating the arguments based on the level of the objectives achievement. Two case studies are presented for applying this new approach of structuring negotiation arguments in real-life software design processes. The results of these case studies have validated our hypothesis and justified our research approach.; This research is an original attempt to develop a theoretical approach to use organized stakeholders’ objectives and preferences to structure collaborative negotiation arguments. This approach synthesizes applicable knowledge from decision science and social studies and leverages their advantages in the domain of software engineering. It overcomes the restriction and challenges of the existing approaches and defines a process with detailed guidance to improve the negotiation quality of software design team and the compatibility of stakeholders’ arguments. These contributions will eventually refine the ways of undertaking negotiation processes and resolve design conflicts in engineering domains...|$|R

40|$|The Swedish Environment Protection Act (SEPA) was {{implemented}} in 1969 and constituted {{the first comprehensive}} Swedish regulation of industry-induced environmental externalities. In keeping with a longstanding corporatist tradition, Swedish policymakers aimed to establish a cooperative climate with industrial producers and instructed the regulatory authorities to strive to reach <b>consensual</b> <b>agreements</b> with affected firms. Despite such accommodations, the environmental adaptation of Swedish industrial production proceeded at a greater pace, during the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s, than in most comparable countries, many of which had implemented seemingly more stringent environmental regulations than had Sweden. This thesis seeks to identify the firm level incentives behind this process, by examining {{the economic impact of}} the SEPA upon one of the more pollution-intensive branches of Swedish industrial production, the pulp and paper industry. Guided by previous research, an hypothesis is proposed in which the implementation of the SEPA came to aid the structural rationalization of this industry during the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s, by inducing the exit of marginal, small-scale pulp and paper mills, thereby relaxing the prevailing competition over wood resources and available market space and creating more room for expansion within the surviving mills. As larger firms tend to operate larger mills, the hypothesized effects are suggested to have benefited large-scale producers within the industry, at the expense of their smaller rivals.   The findings of the thesis show that the economic effects of the SEPA were more severe for small as compared to large-scale mills and that regulatory requirements for pollution abatement did contribute to the shutdown of several small-scale mills during the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s. No conclusive evidence could, however, be found for the validity of the thesis’ hypothesis as a whole, as these shutdowns were not predominantly administered by small-scale firms, as predicted by the hypothesis. Rather, the vast majority of these shutdowns were accounted for by some of the largest firms within the industry. Some tentative evidence was found, however, that the implementation of the SEPA may have benefitted certain large-scale producers within the industry, by facilitating acquisitions of smaller firms with valuable assets. ...|$|R

There has been relatively little examination, however, {{of the extent to which}} decentralized mechanisms can be used to handle the controversial social problem of conflicts among neighboring land-owners. Land development in urban areas is one of the most regulated human activities in the United States. In recent decades, public regula- tion of urban land has increased sharply in incidence and severity, but dissatisfaction with the physical appearance and living arrangements in American cities continues to grow. Despite the evident shortcomings of present public regulatory schemes, even those commentators who propose reliance on the market mechanism in other areas tend to concur with the prevailing view that increased public planning is the most promising guide for the growth of cities. This article advances a different thesis: that conflicts among neighboring landowners are generally better resolved by systems less centralized than master planning and zoning. First, the article offers goals for a land use control system. Three major means of control are then evaluated in terms of these goals: (1) mandatory public regulations (zoning), (2) <b>consensual</b> private <b>agreements</b> (covenants), and (3) the redefinition of property rights and their private enforcement (nuisance law).

A pending debt review has serious consequences. It bars a consumer from entering into further credit agreements and creates a moratorium on debt enforcement by the credit provider. However, a debt review in terms of section 86 does not end or lapse automatically if a specific event fails to occur or upon the expiry of a specific time period. Before a credit provider can enforce a credit agreement that is the subject of a pending debt review, the debt review must be terminated in accordance with section 86 (10) and certain other requirements must be met. If a debt review is incorrectly terminated in accordance with section 86 (10), the enforcement proceedings instituted thereafter will be unlawful and premature. In practice the debt review process - and specifically the termination thereof - are problematic as there appears to be uncertainty, as a result of the sparse provisions of section 86 (10), regarding exactly when a debt review can be terminated. Uncertainty exists regarding the scope of a debt review and whether it should be afforded a narrow or broad interpretation, which will inevitably affect the cut-off date for termination.

40|$|Sendo a consciência e a prática das regras fatores relevantes para a compreensão do desenvolvimento moral, os diferentes contextos que envolvem o jogar com regras, podem revelar-se espaços privilegiados para o estudo da moralidade infantil. De acordo com a abordagem psicogenética piagetiana, o jogo ao possibilitar a livre construção do conhecimento e estimular trocas sociais cooperativas, pode vir a favorecer a superação do egocentrismo moral e intelectual, aspecto este indispensável à construção de juízos morais autônomos. Optou-se no presente estudo por focalizar mais diretamente a relação da criança com a regra em diferentes situações, utilizando-se o jogo como pretexto para o estudo desta relação. O próprio Piaget em seu texto de 1932 usa um jogo de regras para estudar a moralidade e defende esta atividade como uma instituição genuinamente infantil propícia ao desenvolvimento do respeito mútuo e do estado cooperativo {{fundamental}} a autonomia. Posto isto, a presente pesquisa teve como objetivo investigar diferentes formas de interação da criança com a regra em contextos de jogo, articulando-as com o desenvolvimento moral infantil, segundo o referencial psicogenético piagetiano. Participaram da pesquisa 64 crianças com idades entre 07 e 08 anos, divididas em 14 grupos com, em média, quatro componentes cada. Foram aplicadas diferentes situações de contato com regras, sendo que na primeira as crianças jogaram conforme regras prescritas pela experimentadora (situação fechada), na segunda havia a possibilidade da criança intervir e propor novas formas de jogar (situação intermediária) e na terceira foi solicitado que inventassem um jogo com o material fornecido. Foi realizada uma sessão semanal para cada modalidade de contexto descrita, com cada grupo, sendo uma por dia, durante três semanas. Concluída a aplicação dos diferentes contextos de regra, os sujeitos passaram por uma entrevista clínica, na qual foram investigadas suas concepções relativas à regra moral em contraposição a regra do jogo. A sistematização de todo o material coletado consistiu em análises exploratórias a partir da categorização das ações adotadas pelos sujeitos, principalmente aquelas de caráter mais social como, por exemplo, troca de ideias, uso das regras, consideração da perspectiva alheia, interajuda, realização de acordos consensuais, resolução de conflitos, tomadas de decisão, emissão de julgamentos, entre outras. Tais categorias foram então convertidas em indicadores empíricos, com os quais foi possível delimitar três vias de análise: relações entre indicadores; relações entre contextos e acompanhamento individual de cada sujeito. Os resultados demonstram diferentes manifestações de uso e compreensão da regra de acordo com cada contexto analisado, com maiores evidências de autonomia nas situações que propiciavam acordos mútuos e exigiam de forma mais acentuada a relação entre pessoas. Buscou-se, a partir da presente pesquisa, evidenciar aspectos relevantes da relação da criança com a regra no contexto de jogo, entendendo-a como parte importante de seu desenvolvimento moral. São discutidas, assim, algumas interfaces entre o jogar e a moralidade, tomando-se como base os usos e concepções infantis a respeito da regraBeing {{the conscience}} {{and the rules}} practicing relevant issues {{in the understanding of}} the moral development, the different scenes regarding the playing with the rules, could reveal themselves privileged spots for the childhood morality. According to the Piaget psychogenic, the game, as it makes possible the free knowledge construction and estimulate social collaborating exchanges, could encourage the overcoming of the moral and intellectual egocentrism, indispensable issue for the contruction of moral autonomic judgements. It was decided in this study to focus more directly on the childś relationship with the rule in different situations, using the game as an excuse to study this relationship. Piaget himself, in his 1932 texts, uses a rule game to study the morality and defend this activity as a genuine child institution wich provides the mutual respect development and the collaborating state, essential to the autonomy. Once exposed, the present research has the purpose to investigate different ways of child interactions with rules in games scenarios, combining them with the child moral development, following the piagetian model. In the research, 64 children in their 7 to 8 years participated, divided in 14 groups of 4 members each, on the average. It was applied different rule contact situations: in the first, the children played according the rules described by the experience instructor (close situation), in the second one, there was the possibility of the child to intervene and suggest new ways of playing (intermediary situation) and in the third one was solicited that the children invent a game with the provided material. It was realized a weekly session to each scenario described, in each group, once a day along three weeks. Once finished the different contexts applications, the subjects received a clinical interview, where their statements regarding moral rules in opposite to game rules was investigated. The construction scheme of the collected material was based in exploration analysis by the categorization of the adopted actions, mainly the actions with social intents as, for an example: ideas exchange, rules usage, another point of view consideration, interpeople helping, <b>consensual</b> <b>agreements</b> realizations, conflicts resolutions, decision choices, judgment states, among others. The categories was converted in empirical indicators, making possible to delimit three analysis ways: relation between indicators, relation between contexts and individual follow up of each subject. The results demonstrates different manifestations of the usage and rule understanding according to each analyzed context, with more evidence of autonomy in situations that provided mutual agreements and demanded more sharply the relationship between people. It was searched, by the present research, to evidence relevant matters in the child relation with the rule in a game context, understanding the rule as a important part of his moral development. Some interfaces between the play and morality are discussed, taking as a basis the uses and childrenś conceptions about the rul...|$|R

It was theft. —Madonna talking about the leaks to Alexis Petridis of The Guardian. On December 20, 2014, the album was made available for pre-order at the iTunes Store. When ordered, six tracks (five in the United Kingdom) were automatically downloaded. Madonna stated that the songs were meant to be [...] "an early Christmas gift" [...] with the final release on March 10, 2015. Originally, [...] "Living for Love" [...] was intended to serve as the lead single from the album. It was to be released on Valentine's Day, {{with the rest of the}} record slated for the spring. However, due to the leak, the release date had to be pushed up. Oseary recalled that they did not receive a confirmation until Friday night whether the pre-release could be executed, since iTunes was closing for the Christmas weekend. After much discussion on the pros and cons of the release, and with the aid of Interscope vice-chairman Steve Berman, and Apple Inc.'s Robert Kondrk, they were able to go live slowly. The six songs Madonna chose had to be polished, and since the tracks' producers were unavailable, she mastered and mixed them herself. The album's release was compared to Beyoncé's self-titled surprise release in 2013, with The Guardian calling it a [...] "partial Beyoncé". The leaks continued with fourteen new demos being revealed between December 23 and December 27. Three new tracks—"Hold Tight", [...] "Joan of Arc" [...] and [...] "Iconic"—became available following Madonna's Grammy performance.|$|E
