Patients and methods: We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional study, consecutively enrolling PLWH receiving an ART. The quantitative part estimated the strength of preference for different attributes using an online discrete choice experiment (DCE). DCE {{data were analyzed using}} a mixed logit regression model. Qualitative data were collected through individual interviews. A preliminary coding framework was developed which was then further refined and applied during thematic analysis of factors influencing satisfaction and adherence. Results: A total of 101 PLWH took part in the quantitative part and 31 in the qualitative part. Over 90 % had an undetectable viral load. Quantitative data revealed a strong preference for a treatment with limited drug–drug interactions, diarrhea and long-term health problems (P< 0. 0001), and that {{did not need to be}} taken on an empty stomach (P< 0. 0001). Patients also preferred to avoid problems associated with treatment failure (P< 0. 0001) or one that left them with a higher viral load after the first weeks of treatment (P= 0. 044). Differences in CD 4 cell count, and pills that must be taken with food were not significant drivers of treatment choice. The strength of these attributes was reflected in the qualitative data, highlighting the importance patients place on treatment efficacy, and also suggesting that some of these attributes may impact adherence. Many factors influencing adherence and satisfaction with treatment were identified, including pill size, worry about sexual transmission and impact on social life. Conclusion: Most of the attributes included in this survey were important to participants when choosing an ART, in particular those related to quality of life, and these should be taken into account in order to optimize adherence and satisfaction.
