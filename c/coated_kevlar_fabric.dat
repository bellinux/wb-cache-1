The enhancement of <b>Kevlar</b> woven <b>fabric</b> in HAH sandwich panel further strengthens the sandwich panel especially in ballistic tests. <b>Kevlar</b> woven <b>fabric</b> showed extensive pull out (rupture of yarns) when less than 6 layers of fabric impacted by ballistic projectile at a velocity of 293 m/s. Sandwich panel consisting of 6 layers of <b>Kevlar</b> woven <b>fabric</b> incorporated with aluminium honeycomb showed no pull out when impacted by a ballistic projectile at a velocity of 312. 5 m/s. However, when sandwich panel arrangement {{was in the}} following order: 1 layer of HAH, 3 layers of <b>Kevlar</b> woven <b>fabric,</b> 1 layer of HAH, 3 layers of <b>Kevlar</b> woven <b>fabric</b> and a final layer of HAH, <b>Kevlar</b> woven <b>fabric</b> pull out was observed when impacted by a ballistic projectile at a velocity of 277. 8 m/s. This indicated that the ballistic projectile was impacting on 3 layers of <b>Kevlar</b> woven <b>fabric</b> (followed by another 3 layers of <b>Kevlar</b> woven <b>fabric)</b> at a time instead of 6 layers of <b>Kevlar</b> woven <b>fabric</b> based on {{the arrangement of the}} sandwich panel. The overall sandwich panels for both arrangements had the same amount of materials but one failed the ballistic test and the other passed. One possible reason behind the improved ballistic test is that the areal density of <b>Kevlar</b> woven <b>fabric</b> is the highest when the layers of <b>Kevlar</b> woven <b>fabric</b> are assembled together.

40|$|<b>Kevlar</b> <b>fabrics</b> are {{extensively}} used in ballistic protection applications. A primary area {{of research}} involves enhancing the performance of these fabrics while reducing {{the weight of the}} armor so as to ensure battlefield mobility. Silica nano-particle impregnated <b>Kevlar</b> <b>fabrics</b> exhibit significantly enhanced ballistic performance while retaining flexibility. Although individual yarns exhibit rate dependent, nonlinear elastic behavior in tension, the behavior of the fabric itself is complicated because of the interaction of the two distinct media of yarns. A homogenized continuum constitutive model for plain woven <b>Kevlar</b> <b>fabrics</b> was developed previously. Numerical simulations based on this model have yielded good agreement with experimental results. The present study investigates the response and failure of neat and nano-particle impregnated <b>Kevlar</b> <b>fabric</b> under transverse deformation. Static indentation tests were performed on neat and treated K 706 (medium weave) <b>Kevlar</b> <b>fabric.</b> The combined deformation behavior of fabric with a deformable backing material was also examined. Compression tests were done to determine a suitable foundation material. The failure mechanisms were found to depend on multiple factors. Based on these observations, three failure modes – yarn breakage, yarn sliding and indentor slip-through – were identified. A stress based criterion to predict the failure for the uniaxial case was introduced. This criterion was implemented in numerical simulations in conjunction with the constitutive model via a UMAT subroutine in ABAQUS.

40|$|This {{research}} reports {{the design and}} engineering of Kevlar-based stab resistant body armour fabrics and female vests, and evaluates their performance for protection and comfort especially for female police officers. Kevlar-wool woven fabric has been employed as a potential material for body armour vests. This current study investigates the thermal comfort properties of woven Kevlar-wool ballistic fabrics and commercial woven 100 % <b>Kevlar</b> ballistic <b>fabrics.</b> The effects of fabric physical properties on laboratory-measured thermal comfort were analysed. In this context, their thermal comfort performance was compared, and fabric friction and surface roughness were evaluated. A water repellent treatment {{was applied to the}} woven Kevlar-wool fabric to ensure comparable thermal comfort results with the commercial 100 % Kevlar. Since the commercial <b>Kevlar</b> <b>fabric</b> showed a water repellent result in the moisture management test, the effects of the water repellent treatment on the Kevlar-wool fabric were examined as well. This study also presents the fabric bursting strength and tear strength for comparison. Experimental results show a clear difference in thermal comfort properties: the Kevlar-wool fabric possesses better moisture management properties and mechanical properties than the <b>Kevlar</b> <b>fabric.</b> Seams and stitching in body armour could affect their protective and comfort performance. Seamless technology is a method used to minimise cutting and sewing processes in making knitted garments. Seamless technology was adopted to accommodate the bust contour for female body armour designs. The 3 D-knitting technology Shima Seiki SES&ndash;S. WG&reg; and its whole-garment program were used to develop seamless female body armour vests for fit and comfort. The Kevlar-wool and 100 % <b>Kevlar</b> <b>fabrics</b> were produced as weft-knit single jersey using the whole-garment knitting machine and their physical properties were measured. These properties were used to design and engineer two different styles of 3 D seamless female body armour vest, the loose-vest and the bra-vest. The knitted 100 % <b>Kevlar</b> <b>fabric</b> was <b>coated</b> with abrasive particles to enhance stab protection performance. The stab-resistance of personal body armour standard (NIJ 0115. 00) was used to determine the protection level. Single&ndash; and double-blade knives were used in this stab test. The knitted fabric mechanical properties were also investigated using bursting strength tests and stab resistance drop tests with a range of impactors. The results show that one layer of knitted Kevlar-wool, plus eight layers of knitted 100 % <b>Kevlar,</b> and one <b>coated</b> layer with abrasive sand particles (a total of ten layers), passed the tests with less than 7 mm perforation at 8 J using a single-blade knife. Moreover, a combination of the knitted fabrics (Kevlar-wool, 100 % <b>Kevlar</b> and <b>coated</b> <b>Kevlar)</b> could improve their stab-resistance. Multi-layered flexible stab-resistant vests were assembled and evaluated for comfort using a thermal manikin and sweating guarded hot-plate. The moisture management properties of the knitted fabrics were investigated. The results of this research provide a good reference for designing and engineering female body armour capable of resisting stab penetration, as well as possessing improved comfort performance...|$|R

In order to decrease the weight of shielding systems without compromising the protection offered, or {{in order to increase}} protection performance while maintaining constant weight, modern shield concepts have been evaluated in laboratory impact simulation experiments. In this paper, existing "Stuffed Whipple Shield" Protection Systems, such as those used on the US modules of the International Space Station, are described. These systems consist of an Al-bumper and a a so-called "stuffing layer" consisting of a combination of ceramic (Nextel) and aramid (<b>Kevlar)</b> <b>fabrics.</b> On the European ISS module (COLUMBUS), the stuffing consists of Nextel and a layer of Kevlar composite material. New concepts for various bumper and stuffing configurations have been evaluated by means of hypervelocity impact expe riments.

Protection effectiveness of the individual configurations is discussed. It was found that the Al-foam sandwich bumper leads to extended projectile fragmentation due to multi-shock effects in the Al-foam, which yields an increased protection performance at only a slight mass penalty. Furthermore, due to the cellular structure of Al-foam, a much stiffer structure (compared to conventional single-plate Al-bumpers) is obtained. This allows considerable weight savings as less reinforcement materials are needed to stiffen the structure. Therefore, the Al-foam concept was combined with Kevlar stuffing, leading to a truly innovative shielding syst...|$|R

The present study investigated the impact performance of five styles of <b>Kevlar</b> <b>fabrics</b> K 310, K 706, K 720, K 745 and K 779 from Hexcel. The fabrics are different in many aspects, i. e., weight per square meter, yarn counts, yarn size, Kevlar fiber type, friction and breaking strength. Silica nanoparticles were impregnated into the fabric to enhance the ballistic impact performance. The fabric impregnated with nanoparticles exhibit significant enhancement in impact performance over their neat counterparts. Fabrics experience large deformation under impact. More or less yarn pull-out was observed on all the fabrics. The in-plane yarn pull-out force has good correlation to the impact performance: fabrics with higher pull-out force performed better in impact tests. A two-dimensional finite element model was proposed to simulate the single yarn pull-out procedure and predict the maximum pull-out force. The most important fabric features are included in this model: yarn count, yarn size, fabric thickness, yarn waviness, fiber modulus, fiber diameter and coefficients of friction et al. The numerical results show good agreement with the experimentally measured pull-out forces. To understand the impact process, a constitutive model was developed to characterize the nonlinear anisotropic properties of the fabric in large deformation. The nanoparticles largely increase the shear stiffness, while only slightly affect the tension behavior along warp and weft yarn directions. This constitutive model was incorporated in the commercial FEA software ABAQUS through the user-defined material subroutine and used to simulate deformations with various loads.
