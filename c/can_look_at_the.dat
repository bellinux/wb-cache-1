5|$|Justification {{for using}} the Sunnah {{as a source of}} law {{can be found in the}} Qur'an. The Qur'an {{commands}} Muslims to follow Muhammad. During his lifetime, Muhammad made it clear that his traditions (along with the Qur'an) should be followed after his death. The overwhelming majority of Muslims consider the sunnah to be essential supplements to and clarifications of the Qur'an. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Qur'an contains many rules for the behavior expected of Muslims but there are no specific Qur'anic rules on many religious and practical matters. Muslims believe that they <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> way of life, or sunnah, of Muhammad and his companions to discover what to imitate and what to avoid.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes the {{appearance}} of floaters has to be attributed to dark specks in the tear film of the eye. Technically, these are not floaters, but they do look the same {{from the viewpoint of}} the patient. Persons with blepharitis or a dysfunctional meibomian gland are especially prone to this cause, but ocular allergies can also cause the problem. To differentiate between material in the vitreous humour of the eye and debris in the tear film, one <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> effect of blinking: debris in the tear film will move quickly with a blink, while floaters are largely unresponsive to it. Tear film debris is diagnosed by eliminating the possibility of true floaters and macular degeneration.|$|E
25|$|Without {{an actual}} comb one <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> phase vs frequency. Without a carrier–envelope offset all {{frequencies}} are cosines. This {{means that all}} frequencies have the phase zero. The time origin is arbitrary. If a pulse comes at later times, the phase increases linearly with frequency, but still the zero-frequency phase is zero. This phase at zero frequency is the carrier–envelope offset. The second harmonic not only has twice the frequency, but also twice the phase. Thus for a pulse with zero offset the second harmonic of the low-frequency tail is in phase with the fundamental of the high-frequency tail, and otherwise it is not. Spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER) measures how the phase increases with frequency, but it cannot determine the offset, so the name “electric field reconstruction” is a bit misleading.|$|E
2500|$|A {{stopping}} time {{with respect to}} a sequence of random variables X1,X2,X3,... is a random variable τ with the property that for each t, the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event τ = t depends only on the values of X1,X2,X3,...,Xt. The intuition behind the definition is that at any particular time t, you <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sequence so far and tell if it is time to stop. [...] An example in real life might be the time at which a gambler leaves the gambling table, which might be a function of his previous winnings (for example, he might leave only when he goes broke), but he can't choose to go or stay based on the outcome of games that haven't been played yet.|$|E

Beyond budgetary and time restraints, the only rule was that the film meet the official minimum quota of four nude or sex scenes per hour. Patrick Macias notes the diversity of styles this format allowed. Director Chūsei Sone [...] "specialized in ribald tales from the past", Yasuharu Hasebe, [...] "delivered frightening, raw, and violent images", and Tanaka created films which were [...] "as sophisticated as they were erotic." [...] In later years, reflecting on his work in the genre, Tanaka pointed out, [...] "We <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> core of human beings without disguising anything and can express ourselves very honestly. That's why working on Roman porno is such an enjoyable experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{prognosis}} of thyroid {{cancer is}} related to the type of cancer and the stage at the time of diagnosis. [...] For {{the most common form of}} thyroid cancer, papillary, the overall prognosis is excellent. Indeed, the increased incidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma in recent years is likely related to increased and earlier diagnosis. One <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> trend to earlier diagnosis in two ways. The first is that many of these cancers are small and not likely to develop into aggressive malignancies. A second perspective is that earlier diagnosis removes these cancers at a time when they are not likely to have spread beyond the thyroid gland, thereby improving the long-term outcome for the patient. There is no consensus at present on whether this trend toward earlier diagnosis is beneficial or unnecessary.|$|E
2500|$|As a semi-solid, {{mayonnaise}} has {{an extremely}} high viscosity {{and because of}} this, its flow properties have been studied extensively. Shear stress is an important term when discussing liquids and solids at any viscosity and {{is defined as the}} force per unit area that is required to drag one layer of substance past another layer. Rheology is the study of science that deals with the flow and deformation of matter and is an umbrella for a few of mayonnaise's properties. One of which includes yield stress which can be defined as a minimum shear stress required to initiate flow. So, with all of these terms now defined, one <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> specific properties that mayonnaise possesses. Mayonnaise has a high shear stress with a typical yield stress around 100 Pascals). For reference, ketchup has a yield stress of about 15 Pascals. With such a high yield stress, mayonnaise is able to resist low forces and even return to its original conformation. A simple equation can be written to explain the relationship between these terms: ...|$|E
