40|$|Pyrolytic {{characteristics}} of biomass/coal mixtures were investigated under conditions pertinent to pulverised fuel boilers. It {{was found that}} the mixtures of biomass/coal follow the behaviour of their parent materials in an additive manner. The two fuels did not <b>chemically</b> interact under <b>inert</b> <b>conditions</b> indicating a general lack of synergistic effects. As such, the yield of the major pyrolysis products is linearly proportional to the percentage of biomass and coal in the mixture. Even the compositions of the gaseous products from blended samples are linearly proportional to those of their parent fuels. These findings can potentially help to understand and predict the behaviour of biomass/coal blends in practical systems...|$|R
40|$|Since {{epitaxial}} silicene is not <b>chemically</b> <b>inert</b> under ambient <b>conditions,</b> {{its application}} in devices and the ex-situ characterization outside of ultrahigh vacuum environments {{require the use}} of an insulating capping layer. Here, we report on a study of the feasibility of encapsulating epitaxial silicene on ZrB 2 (0001) thin films grown on Si(111) substrates by aluminum nitride (AlN) deposited using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and ammonia (NH 3) precursors. By in-situ high-resolution core-level photoelectron spectroscopy, the chemical modifications of the surface due to subsequent exposure to TMA and NH 3 molecules, at temperatures of 300 ◦C and 400 ◦C, espectively, have been investigated. While an AlN-related layer can indeed be grown, silicene reacts strongly with both precursor molecules resulting in the formation of Si–C and Si–N bonds such that the use of these precursors does not allow for the protective AlN encapsulation that leaves the electronic properties of silicene intact...|$|R
40|$|Rocky {{planets are}} thought to {{comprise}} compounds of Mg and O as {{these are among the}} most abundant elements, but knowledge of their stable phases may be incomplete. MgO is known to be remarkably stable to very high pressure and <b>chemically</b> <b>inert</b> under reduced <b>condition</b> of the Earth's lower mantle. However, in 'icy' gas giants as well as in exoplanets oxygen may be a more abundant constituent (Ref. 1, 2). Here, using synchrotron x-ray diffraction in laser-heated diamond anvil cells, we show that MgO and oxygen react at pressures above 94 GPa and T = 2150 K with the formation of the theoretically predicted I 4 /mcm MgO 2 (Ref. 3). Raman spectroscopy detects the presence of a peroxide ion (O 22 -) in the synthesized material {{as well as in the}} recovered specimen. Likewise, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy confirms that the recovered sample has higher oxygen content than pure MgO. Our finding suggests that MgO 2 may substitute MgO in rocky mantles and rocky planetary cores under highly oxidizing conditions...|$|R
40|$|Xenon, {{which is}} quite <b>inert</b> under ambient <b>conditions,</b> may become {{reactive}} under pressure. The possibility {{of the formation of}} stable xenon oxides and silicates in the interior of the Earth could explain the atmospheric missing xenon paradox. Using an ab initio evolutionary algorithm, we predict the existence of thermodynamically stable Xe–O compounds at high pressures (XeO, XeO 2 and XeO 3 become stable at pressures above 83, 102 and 114 GPa, respectively). Our calculations indicate large charge transfer in these oxides, suggesting that large electronegativity difference and high pressure are the key factors favouring the formation of xenon compounds. However, xenon compounds cannot exist in the Earth’s mantle: xenon oxides are unstable in equilibrium with the metallic iron occurring in the lower mantle, and xenon silicates are predicted to decompose spontaneously at all mantle pressures (< 136 GPa). However, it is possible that xenon atoms may be retained at defects in mantle silicates and oxides. X enon is a noble gas, and is <b>chemically</b> <b>inert</b> under ambient <b>conditions.</b> However, a few xenon fluorides have been ident-ified 1 – 3 with xenon atoms in oxidation states þ 2, þ 4, þ 6 or þ 8. With application of high pressure, the molecular phase of insu-lating XeF 2 has been reported to transform into two- and three...|$|R
