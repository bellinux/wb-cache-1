Co-production is a commonly used approach to facilitate access to basic services in informal settlements in the developing world. But, rigorous micro-econometric evaluation of its causal effects is rare. This study uses a ‘natural experiment’, possible due to strict technical reasons involved {{in the provision of}} gas energy to informal neighbourhoods in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area, to estimate the effects on the social and physical dimension of residents’ investments. Estimates are created at three co-production stages: an initial social interaction stage to introduce the service; the <b>connection</b> <b>stage,</b> and; an impact stage several years after programme completion. The research measures effect on housing improvements, participatory involvement associated with the internalisation of benefits, and suggests the presence of collective capacity for furthering collaborative efforts. The latter can be associated with the significant improvement in the residents’ reported trust in neighbourhood organisations at the different implementation stages. Importantly, the research measures residual effects by legal tenure conditions. Co-production has contributed to an incremental effect only for informal residents’ reported level of trust in the local public sector. Trust in the family, rather than generalised trust, appears as a significant residual effect of the intervention that is positively correlated with the undertaking of housing improvements. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} whether early identification of physiologic variances associated with interstage death would reduce mortality, {{we developed a}} home surveillance program. MethodsPatients discharged before initiation of home surveillance (group A, n = 63) were compared with patients discharged with an infant scale and pulse oximeter (group B, n = 24). Parents maintained a daily log of weight and arterial oxygen saturation according to pulse oximetry and were instructed to contact their physician {{in case of an}} arterial oxygen saturation less than 70 % according to pulse oximetry, an acute weight loss of more than 30 g in 24 hours, or failure to gain at least 20 g during a 3 -day period. ResultsInterstage mortality among infants surviving to discharge was 15. 8 % (n = 9 / 57) in group A and 0 % (n = 0 / 24) in group B (P =. 039). Surveillance criteria were breached for 13 of 24 group B patients: 12 patients with decreased arterial oxygen saturation according to pulse oximetry with or without poor weight gain and 1 patient with poor weight gain alone. These 13 patients underwent bidirectional superior cavopulmonary <b>connection</b> (<b>stage</b> 2 palliation) at an earlier age, 3. 7 ± 1. 1 months of age versus 5. 2 ± 2. 0 months for patients with an uncomplicated interstage course (P =. 028).

40|$|I studied {{amphibians}} {{and their}} associated wetlands in the Missouri River floodplain in Iowa from 2010 - 2013. I {{had the opportunity}} to study the effect of a catastrophic flood on an anuran community in the Missouri River floodplain. Three species (plains leopard frog, Woodhouse 2 ̆ 7 s toad, and Blanchard 2 ̆ 7 s cricket frog) had only minor changes in adult male occupancy rate in the two years after the flood. Colonization rates for these species were positively associated with wetlands that were shallower near the shore and they {{did not appear to be}} affected by reduced vegetation. Three other species or species complexes (northern leopard frog, the gray treefrog complex, and boreal chorus frog) had greatly reduced occupancy rates in the two years after the flood. Colonization rates for these species were relatively low, and they had high extinction rates. Colonization rates for these species were not associated with any measured habitat characteristic. Future flood events will likely continue to make northern leopard frogs, gray treefrogs, and boreal chorus frogs a less important part of the ecological community. Although some species may fare well under extreme climate events forecast under climate change scenarios, I hypothesize that many species will be challenged. Amphibian conservation has often relied on auditory call surveys to determine habitat associations of anuran species. These surveys are restricted to only a single important life stage, however, and management recommendations from call surveys alone risk creating ecological traps or population sinks. Calling adult male surveys had established that slope at the inner edge of the wetland, wetland area, and percentage of bare ground within 1 m of the wetland were important habitat associations of calling adults of various species. I surveyed tadpoles and metamorphs of 5 anuran species and compared habitat associations for extinction rates of tadpoles and metamorphs with habitat associations for calling adults and found little overlap. I also estimated occupancy rates for calling adults, tadpoles, and metamorphs. Occupancy estimates indicate that reproductive success is variable, but the reasons are unknown. Occupancy rates of tadpoles and metamorphs were often lower than occupancy rates of adult calling males. Too often amphibian conservation and management proceeds with little information on critical aquatic life stages and I recommend greater emphasis on the entire life cycle to avoid potential misinformed conservation actions. The importance of isolated wetlands disconnected from the river in large river floodplains has largely been ignored and consequently there is little management supporting this important component of productivity and biodiversity. Isolated and fishless wetlands in the upper elevations of floodplains may support a community largely absent from the rest of the floodplain. Flow regulation has rendered the upper elevations of many floodplains nearly devoid of wetlands but restoration of large river floodplains places no emphasis on isolated wetlands, despite concern over their status elsewhere. Primary drivers of community composition in isolated wetlands are predatory fish and hydrology. Wetlands are likely colonized by fish, and I used a GIS model of the floodplain topography to estimate the <b>connection</b> <b>stage</b> (the river stage when a wetland floods), and fill stage (river stage corresponding to the minimum elevation of the wetland, which is an indication of hydroperiod) of isolated wetlands in my study site. I compared the characteristics of current isolated wetlands to historical hydrology to determine how often fishless isolated wetlands are present. Productivity and biodiversity of the floodplain could be increased greatly by increasing the number of wetlands with a <b>connection</b> <b>stage</b> corresponding to river stage of 8 - 9 m and a fill stage of 5 - 7 m. I recommend restoration of large river floodplains give due consideration to the entire gradient of wetland types that were present before flow regulation so that the full complement of biodiversity and productivity can be restored. I used a the multi-season occupancy model to estimate occupancy rates of successive life stages in Chapter 3, herein referred to as multiple life stage design. The constraints in a multi-stage analysis, namely, colonization rates of 0 and the successively decreasing occupancy rates for each life stage, require special considerations during the study design phase. I used simulations to explore the robustness of the parameter estimates when incorrectly assuming that colonization rate is 0. I explored the effect of design considerations such as the number of sites, detection probability, and number of surveys on confidence intervals of occupancy rates. Unacceptable bias in nearly all parameters is induced by true values of the colonization rate as low as 0. 05 when the colonization rate is fixed to 0. Confidence intervals for occupancy rates are most improved by increasing the number of sites, but also by increasing detection probability and increasing the number of surveys. Under a simulated scenario with 50 sites, confidence intervals overlapped if the difference between occupancy rates was approximately 0. 3 or less. Under excellent simulated study conditions with 200 sites, confidence intervals overlapped when the difference between occupancy rates was approximately 0. 15 or less. These results will aid researchers in making appropriate study design decisions to avoid bias and meet their objectives in researching life stages...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of excessive levels of voltage unbalance (VU) {{stands as a}} problem of power quality that has far reaching consequences for both customers and electric utilities. Thus, the development of well researched engineering practices is required to maintain acceptable voltage unbalance levels while utilising the total voltage unbalance absorption capacity of the power system. Although the connection of an unbalanced installation changes the existing un- balance level {{at the point of}} evaluation (POE), the installation is not solely responsible for the total VU emission level that results at the POE. A provision should be given to the contribution made by network inherent asymmetries as well. Thus, location of VU emission contributors, allocation of individual emission limits, compliance assessment and implementation of any corrective measures {{have been found to be}} key aspects of the total VU management process. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Technical Report IEC/TR 61000 - 3 - 13 : 2008 prescribes guiding principles for coordinating negative sequence VU between various voltage levels of a power system through the allocation of emission limits to installations. Although the IEC report is based on widely accepted basic concepts and principles, it requires refinements and original developments in relation to some of the key aspects, especially compliance assessment at the post-connection stage. Compliance assessment is a less developed area and is essential to ensure that the emission limits set by the IEC VU emission allocation methodology in the pre- <b>connection</b> <b>stage</b> are complied by an installation. This thesis primarily focuses on the development of VU emission assessment techniques, thus making contributions for further improvements to the IEC report. The core hypotheses of the work brings a generalised approach for classifying different sources of unbalance at the POE (covering both radial networks and inter- connected networks) giving emphasis to the discrimination between customer and network responsibility on VU emission. In the case of interconnected networks, concurrently existing sources of VU, while taking their multiple interactions at the POE into account, are analysed in a generalised manner. Accordingly, major emission contributors are identified as (a) contribution made by local load asymmetry, (b) contribution made by local line asymmetries and (c) contribution made by back- ground voltage unbalance asymmetries (taking into account the effect of VU propagation from upstream or surrounding busbars to the busbar under observation (i. e. POE)). Mathematical models which are based on the use of complex voltage unbalance factors (VUFs) are developed to decompose the total VU emission at the POE into its constituent components. Further, the proposed deterministic methodologies utilise pre-connection and post-connection voltage/current measurements at busbars along with known system parameters, ensuring that such data can be relatively easily established. Theoretical bases are verified using three-phase unbalanced load flow studies in relation to several hypothetical and practical networks. The proposed methodologies are used to examine the VU behaviour of a practical, interconnected sub-transmission network giving emphasis to the identification of the most dominant emission contributors and hence a ranking of emission sources is established. Some of the key aspects used in the IEC VU emission allocation methodology are reviewed using rigorous outcomes of proposed VU emission assessment techniques. Similar to the counterpart IEC guidelines for harmonics (IEC 61000 - 3 - 6) and flicker (IEC 61000 - 3 - 7) allocation, IEC/TR 61000 - 3 - 13 also apportions the global emission allowance to an installation in proportion to the ratio between the agreed apparent power and the total available apparent power of the system seen at the busbar where it is connected. An additional factor, kuE is introduced to apportion the total VU emission allowance between load and line asymmetries, of which a rudimentary approach is provided for its evaluation. In this thesis, while giving a systematic methodology to determine the kuE factor, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate its dependency on various power system parameters. VU propagation is an important aspect in determining individual emission limits to unbalanced installations. Although the IEC technical report IEC/TR 61000 - 3 - 13 : 2008 quantifies VU propagation from higher voltage to lower voltage levels in terms of transfer coefficients, and from one busbar to other neighbouring busbars of a sub-system in terms of influence coefficients, the IEC method is proven to have anomalies. The proposed VU emission assessment techniques can separate the influence made by background unbalance on the total VU emission at the POE based on which a systematic approach is presented to evaluate VU propagation coefficients in a generalised manner considering different load types. Although the resultant VU emission is theoretically defined as the vector sum- mation of unbalanced voltage components caused by individual sources at the POE, VU emission allocation methodology utilises the application of a general summation law for accumulating numerous sources of unbalance to take into account the contributions made by random variations of unbalance. Outcomes of deterministic studies are used to develop a statistical approach in order to assess the post-connection VU levels by revising the existing general summation law which provides path ways to initiate an economic analysis in relation to VU, adopting uncertainties involved in the power system. As an essential tool for carrying out the studies presented in this thesis, an unbalanced load flow program based on the phase coordinate reference frame incorporating the component level load flow constraints and the three-phase modelling of system components is developed in MATLAB in addition to the simulations carried out in PSCAD/EMTDC and DIgSILENT PowerFactory platforms...|$|E
