5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her <b>closing</b> <b>argument,</b> Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E
5|$|Whether counsel are {{appointed}} or retained, the Clause protects {{the role of}} counsel and certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship. For example, the Clause requires that the defendant be given time to consult with counsel and that counsel be given time to investigate the case pre-trial. And, the Clause also prohibits a state from barring a defendant from being cross-examined by counsel, or restricting {{the order in which}} the defendant may be called as a witness. Further, the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess, even if the recess bisects direct- and cross-examination of the defendant. Similarly, the defendant has a right to have her counsel make a <b>closing</b> <b>argument,</b> even if a bench trial.|$|E
25|$|After {{three days}} of trial, the {{prosecutor}} concluded his <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> urging jurors to convict Hans Reiser for murdering his wife. In his <b>closing</b> <b>argument,</b> Reiser's attorney, William Du Bois, urged the jury to consider a sentence of voluntary manslaughter if they believed that Nina was dead and that Hans Reiser killed her {{in a moment of}} passion.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Judge Julie Conger {{said that}} on February 23, she would hold <b>closing</b> <b>arguments</b> and rule on whether there was enough {{evidence}} to order Hans Reiser to stand trial. On February 22, 2007, the <b>closing</b> <b>arguments</b> were postponed until March 9 as Reiser's attorney was involved with an unrelated trial that was running longer than expected.|$|R
25|$|In his <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> {{before the}} jury on November 17, Baxley {{acknowledged}} that Chambliss was not the sole perpetrator in the bombing, before informing the jury of his regret that the state was unable to request {{the death penalty in}} this case, owing to the fact the death penalty in Alabama which had been in effect in 1963 had been repealed, and that the current death penalty within the state was only applicable in relation to crimes committed after its reinstatement. Noting that the day of the <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> fell upon what would have been Carol Denise McNair's 26th birthday, and that she would have likely been a mother by this date, Baxley harked towards the testimony earlier delivered by Carol's father, Chris McNair, and requested that the jury return a verdict of guilty.|$|E
25|$|Darrow's {{condemnation}} {{of the death penalty}} during his legendary 12-hour <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> catalyzed a major reversal in American attitudes toward capital punishment. In the decades that followed, the number of U.S. executions, which had been rising steadily since the early 1800s, began a rapid decline, eventually culminating in a de facto moratorium on the death penalty from 1972 until 1976.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, prosecutor Anatoly Zadorozhny {{delivered his}} <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> before the judge. Harking towards the earlier testimony of psychiatrists at the trial, Zadorozhny argued that Chikatilo fully understood the criminality of his actions, {{was able to}} resist his homicidal impulses, and had made numerous conscious efforts to avoid detection. Moreover, Zadorozhny emphasized that in 19 of the charges, the material evidence of the crimes had been provided by Chikatilo himself. Zadorozhny then recited each of the charges before formally requesting the death penalty.|$|E

25|$|In his {{rebuttal}} <b>closing</b> <b>argument,</b> {{defense attorney}} Art Hanes Jr. attacked the evidence {{presented by the}} prosecution as being purely circumstantial, adding that similar circumstantial evidence had earlier seen Chambliss acquitted of the church bombing in 1963. Hanes also harked towards the testimony {{of several of the}} 12 witnesses the defense had called to testify as to Chambliss's whereabouts {{on the day of the}} bombing, including a policeman and a neighbor who had each testified as to Chambliss being at the home of a man named Clarence Dill on the day of the bombing.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the prosecutor's <b>closing</b> <b>argument,</b> Judge Akubzhanov invited Chikatilo back into the courtroom, before formally asking him whether he would like to make a final statement on his own behalf. In response, Chikatilo simply sat mute. Judge Akubzhanov then announced an initial date of 15 September for himself and the two official jurors to review the evidence and pass final sentence upon Chikatilo. (This date was later postponed until 14 October.) As court announced recess, the brother of Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a 17-year-old girl killed by Chikatilo in August 1984, threw a heavy chunk of metal at Chikatilo, hitting him in the chest. When security tried to arrest the young man, other victims' relatives shielded him.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, January 29, {{the prosecution}} delivered a 40-minute <b>closing</b> <b>argument.</b> Blagojevich then delivered his 47-minute closing arguments in defense. Among Blagojevich's statement were continuing reminders {{that he believed}} the process to be tainted {{because it did not}} allow him to call witnesses or challenge the evidence (although, as the Chicago Tribune reported two days earlier, the process did in fact allow the governor to call witnesses and challenge the evidence, but Blagojevich had done neither by the deadline). The prosecution then made a 12-minute rebuttal. Blagojevich did not remain in the Statehouse for the prosecution's rebuttal speech or the vote on his impeachment. After giving his closing statement, Blagojevich immediately left Springfield to return to his Chicago home aboard an official state aircraft. Had Blagojevich remained in Springfield for his impeachment, he would have been immediately ineligible to be transported on state aircraft as he would no longer be Governor—he would have been stranded in Springfield, responsible for his own transportation home.|$|E

25|$|Judge Advocate John Bingham {{presented}} the <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> for the prosecution. The military tribunal had jurisdiction, he said, {{not only because}} the court itself had ruled {{at the beginning of the}} trials that it did but because they were crimes committed in a military zone, during a time of war, and against high government officials in carrying out treasonous activities. Bingham pointed out that the Surratt boarding house was where the conspiracy was planned, and Atzerodt, Booth, and Powell had all met with Surratt. Booth had paid for the rental of the carriage that took Surratt to Surrattsville each time, and Bingham said that was evidence that Surratt's trips were critical to the conspiracy. Bingham also said that Lloyd's testimony had been corroborated by others and that his unwillingness to reveal the cache of weapons in the tavern was prompted by his subservient tenant relationship to Surratt. Bingham concluded by reiterating the government's key point: Powell had returned to the Surratt house seeking Surratt, and that alone was proof of her guilt. Bingham also pointed out for the tribunal that the charge a person was indicted for was irrelevant. Under the law of conspiracy, if one person carries out a crime, all conspirators are guilty of the same crime.|$|E
25|$|The {{second trial}} began January 11, 1922, {{with a new}} jury, but with the same legal defense and {{prosecution}} {{as well as the}} same presiding judge. The same evidence was presented, but this time one of the witnesses, Zey Prevon, testified that Brady had forced her to lie. Another witness who testified during the first trial, a former security guard named Jesse Norgard, who worked at Culver Studios where Arbuckle worked, testified that Arbuckle had once shown up at the studio and offered him a cash bribe in exchange for the key to Rappe's dressing room. The comedian supposedly said he wanted it to play a joke on the actress. Norgard said he refused to give him the key. During cross-examination, Norgard's testimony was called into question when he was revealed to be an ex-convict who was currently charged with sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, and who was also looking for a sentence reduction from Brady in exchange for his testimony. Further, in contrast to the first trial, Rappe's history of promiscuity and heavy drinking was detailed. The second trial also discredited some major evidence such as the identification of Arbuckle's fingerprints on the hotel bedroom door: Heinrich took back his earlier testimony from the first trial and testified that the fingerprint evidence was likely faked. The defense was so convinced of an acquittal that Arbuckle was not called to testify. Arbuckle's lawyer, McNab, made no <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> to the jury. However, some jurors interpreted the refusal to let Arbuckle testify as a sign of guilt. After over 40 hours of deliberation, the jury returned February 3, deadlocked with a 10–2 not guilty verdict, resulting in another mistrial.|$|E
500|$|The defense {{rested on}} January 30. Dutcher {{delivered}} the <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> {{for the prosecution}} on the robbery charges, Grandin for the defense.

500|$|Czolgosz went {{on trial}} {{for the murder of}} McKinley in state court in Buffalo on September 23, 1901, nine days after the {{president}} died. Prosecution testimony took two days and consisted principally of the doctors who treated McKinley and various eyewitnesses to the shooting. Defense attorney Loran L. Lewis and his co-counsel called no witnesses, which Lewis in his <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> attributed to Czolgosz's refusal to cooperate with them. In his 27-minute address to the jury, Lewis took pains to praise President McKinley; Miller notes that the <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> was more calculated to defend the attorney's [...] "place in the community, rather than an effort to spare his client the electric chair". After a bare half-hour of deliberations, the jury convicted Czolgosz; he was subsequently sentenced to death and executed by electric chair on October 29, 1901. Acid was placed in the casket to dissolve his body, before burial in the prison graveyard.|$|E
