5|$|In 1429, when Isabeau {{lived in}} English-occupied Paris, the {{accusation}} was again put forth that CharlesVII {{was not the}} son of CharlesVI. At that time, with two contenders for the French throne—the young HenryVI and disinherited Charles—this could have been propaganda {{to prop up the}} English claim. Furthermore, gossip spread that Joan of Arc was Isabeau and Orleans' illegitimate daughter—a rumor Gibbons finds improbable because Joan of Arc almost <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> born for some years after Orléans' assassination. Stories circulated that the dauphins were murdered, and attempts were made to poison the other children, all of which added to Isabeau's reputation of one of history's great villains.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on {{the morning}} of 7 April, Pedro, his wife, and others, {{including}} his daughter MariaII and his sister Ana de Jesus, were taken on board the British warship HMS Warspite. The vessel remained at anchor off Rio de Janeiro, and, on 13 April, the former emperor transferred to and departed for Europe aboard HMS Volage. He arrived in Cherbourg-Octeville, France, on 10 June. During the next few months, he shuttled between France and Great Britain. He was warmly welcomed by, but received no actual support from, either government. Finding himself in an awkward situation because he held no official status in either the Brazilian Imperial House or in the Portuguese Royal House, Pedro assumed the title of Duke of Braganza on 15 June, a position that once had been his as heir to Portugal's crown. Although the title should have belonged to MariaII's heir, which he <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> <b>not,</b> his claim was met with general recognition. On 1 December, his only daughter by Amélie, Maria Amélia, was born in Paris.|$|E

25|$|How {{and when}} the blight Phytophthora infestans arrived in Europe is still uncertain; however, it almost <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> present prior to 1842, and {{probably}} arrived in 1844.

25|$|There {{were not}} nearly enough troops to defend Byzantium's borders {{at the time and}} there <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> enough for the two factions to split; consequently, {{foreigner}} mercenaries were brought in. Kantakouzenos hired Turks and Serbs — his main supply of Turkish mercenaries came from the Bey of Aydin, a nominal ally established by Andronikos III. The Regency of John V relied on Turkish mercenaries as well. However, Kantakouzenos began to draw support from the Ottoman Sultan Orhan, who wed Kantakouzenos' daughter in 1345. By 1347, Kantakouzenos had triumphed and entered Constantinople. However, in his hour of victory, he came to an accord with Anna and her son, John V: John V (now 15 years of age) and Kantakouzenos would rule as co-emperors, though John V would be the junior in this relationship. This unlikely partnership was not destined to last long.|$|E

500|$|In 179 BC Philip {{died and}} his talented and ambitious son, Perseus of Macedon, took his throne and showed a renewed {{interest}} in Greece. He also allied himself with the warlike Bastarnae, and both this and his actions in Greece possibly violated the treaty signed with the Romans by his father or, if not, <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> [...] "behaving as [...] a subordinate ally should". Rome declared war on Macedonia again, starting the Third Macedonian War. Perseus initially had greater military success against the Romans than his father, winning the Battle of Callicinus against a Roman consular army. However, as with all such ventures in this period, Rome responded by simply sending another army. The second consular army duly defeated the Macedonians at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC and the Macedonians, lacking the reserve of the Romans and with King Perseus captured, duly capitulated, ending the Third Macedonian War.|$|E
500|$|The Warrior-class design used many well-proven {{technologies}} {{that had been}} used in ocean-going ships for years, including her iron hull, steam engine, and screw propeller; only her wrought-iron armour was a major technological advance. Naval architect and historian David K. Brown wrote, [...] "What made [...] truly novel was the way in which these individual aspects were blended together, making her the biggest and most powerful warship in the world." [...] Being faster, better armoured and harder to hit than her rivals, she was superior to any existing naval ship. The Admiralty immediately stopped the construction of all wooden ships of the line, and ordered another eleven ironclads over the next few years. Jacky Fisher, who was the ship's gunnery lieutenant in 1863–64, later wrote that in spite of this, most people did not realise at the time what a significant change it would bring about: [...] "It <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> appreciated that this, our first armourclad ship of war, would cause a fundamental change in what had been in vogue for something like a thousand years." ...|$|E

500|$|LeMond grew {{up living}} an active, outdoor life. Hiking, hunting, skiing and flyfishing were boyhood pastimes. The ranch country [...] of the Sierra Nevada {{mountain}} range lent itself to such pursuits. A hyperactive youngster, LeMond believes these outdoor activities helped {{keep him out}} of trouble. [...] "I was a boy who just could not sit still. I had trouble focusing in school. Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a classic case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today. My triumph over the symptoms was found atop two thin tires over many dusty miles." [...] Said LeMond: [...] "That's one of the traits. It's the inability to sit down [...] to something you are not really interested in and absorb it. If they are interested in it, people with ADD excel in really good ways. When I got into cycling I would say the sport itself took a fog off my brain. I was able to absorb stuff I read. It changed my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Hubbard's {{academic}} record, {{which came}} to light in the 1970s, revealed {{that he had been}} a student in George Washington University's School of Engineering and had majored in civil engineering. He attended the summer semester in 1931 and the fall and spring semesters in 1931–32. In September 1931, he was placed on probation and he failed to return for the fall 1932 semester. A Scientology account says that he [...] "excell in but thoroughly detest his subjects"; while the latter may have been true, the former <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> <b>not,</b> as his grades were consistently poor. At the end of his first year, he received a D average grade, earning an A for physical education, B for English, C for mechanical engineering, D for general chemistry and Fs for German and calculus. During his second year, he enrolled in a class on atomic and molecular physics– the [...] "nuclear physics" [...] course cited in his official biographies– but earned an F grade. His other grades were also poor, ranging from a B for English to D in calculus and electrical and magnetic physics. He dropped out soon afterwards. Although Hubbard told Look magazine in 1950 that [...] "I never took my degree," [...] a biography published a few years later by the Church of Scientology's Ability magazine nonetheless identifies him as the holder of a [...] "B.

2500|$|The {{early history}} of the president's seal remains obscure, as there is {{essentially}} no record on early usage, nor when its use started.

The first documented seal was in 1850 (which almost <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the first one), and the design used on today's seal had its origins in a coat of arms used on invitations by President Hayes in 1877. [...] It was not defined in law until an executive order by President Truman in 1945.|$|E

2500|$|The sword {{has drawn}} praise as well. Frantzen {{notes that the}} sword can be both an {{offensive}} and defensive weapon, which mitigates against {{an interpretation of the}} Cross of Sacrifice as a glorification of war. The sword also incorporates elements of chivalry, which was an important value to officers and men during the war. Historian Mark Sheftall agrees that the sword evokes chivalric themes, and argues that by combining the religious and the chivalric with the classical Blomfield created [...] "a single powerful image". But the military element has also been criticized. [...] Geurst argues that one may interpret the sword as implying that the Great War was a religious crusade—which it most <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> <b>not.</b>|$|E

Indeed, Dalton records that Indian dealers initially made copies of items and tried to pass them off to Franks, who though not deceived, bought some [...] "at a small percentage over the gold value" [...] and then received the genuine objects, which were easily distinguished. [...] Considerable comfort has been received from the objects' similarity to later Achaemenid finds, many excavated under proper archaeological conditions, which the Oxus Treasure <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> <b>not.</b> [...] In particular, finds of jewellery including armlets and torcs in a tomb at Susa by a French expedition from 1902 onwards (now in the Louvre) are closely similar to the Oxus finds.|$|E
