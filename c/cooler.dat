5|$|During the Ice Age a vast, {{cold and}} dry mammoth steppe {{stretched}} from the Arctic islands southwards to China, and from Spain eastwards across Eurasia {{and over the}} Bering land bridge into Alaska and the Yukon, where it was blocked by the Wisconsin glaciation. The land bridge existed because sea levels were lower due to more of the planet's water being locked up in glaciers compared with today. Therefore, {{the flora and fauna}} of Beringia were more related to those of Eurasia rather than to those of North America. In eastern Beringia from 35,000 YBP the northern Arctic areas experienced temperatures 1.5°C (2.7°F) warmer than today, but the southern sub-Arctic regions were 2°C (3.5°F) <b>cooler.</b> In 22,000YBP, during the Last Glacial Maximum, the average summer temperature was 3-5°C (5.4-9°F) <b>cooler</b> than today, with variations of 2.9°C (5.2°F) <b>cooler</b> on the Seward Peninsula to 7.5°C (13.5°F) <b>cooler</b> in the Yukon.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cooling</b> in a {{centrifugal}} compressor {{can improve the}} performance and reduce the impeller temperature. In a {{centrifugal compressor}}, external walls can be <b>cool</b> down, which {{is known as the}} shell <b>cooling.</b> This method avoids undesirable effects induced by other <b>cooling</b> methods. <b>Cooling</b> can be applied on different external walls, such as the shroud, diffuser or the back plate. This paper focuses on seeking the most effective <b>cooling</b> place to increase the performance and reduce the impeller temperature. It is found that shroud <b>cooling</b> improves the compressor performance the most. Shroud <b>cooling</b> with 2400 W of <b>cooling</b> power increases the pressure ratio by 4. 6 % and efficiency by 1. 49 %. Each 500 W increase in the shroud <b>cooling</b> power, increases the efficiency by 0. 3 %. Diffuser <b>cooling</b> and back plate <b>cooling</b> have an identical effect on the polytropic efficiency. However, back plate <b>cooling</b> increases the pressure ratio more than diffuser <b>cooling.</b> Furthermore, only back plate <b>cooling</b> reduces the impeller temperature, and with 2400 W of <b>cooling</b> power, the impeller temperature reduces by 45 K...|$|R
