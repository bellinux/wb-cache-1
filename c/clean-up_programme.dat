40|$|Brownfields are {{potentially}} contaminated sites that often present economic development opportunities that require financing. State environmental voluntary <b>clean-up</b> <b>programmes</b> (VCPs) offer closure letters {{as a way}} for developers to obtain assurance that their clean-up was completed properly and is 'bankable'. However, there is still fear among lenders about the potential for these closed remediated sites to be reopened and therefore negatively affect the value of the real estate as collateral. While it is believed to be an infrequent act, there has been no comprehensive study of reopeners, and therefore of the effectiveness of VCPs available. This study seeks to quantify the incidence of reopeners in the USA through a systematic inventory of VCP administrators. The authors initially find that among the 46 states with VCPs, only 12 cases were reopened out of 11 497 closed environmental cases, a reopener rate of between 0. 1 % and 0. 2 %. However, reopener rates may increase with more vigorous enforcement and over the passage of time. This information means that brownfield deals can go forward with confidence, and that the risk of reopeners can now be quantified, allowing cheaper insurance and more assurance that negative outcomes can be avoided. ...|$|R
40|$|The 2009 Samoan Tsunami killed 143 and {{affected}} 4389 people. Before communities {{could begin}} to rebuild, the tonnes of potentially hazardous (to {{public health and the}} environment) debris had to be removed. Interviews were conducted with professionals involved in, and affected by, the tsunami debris clean-up in April 2010. A number of government and international non-governmental organisation initiated <b>clean-up</b> <b>programmes</b> in affected communities. Terrestrial waste clearance was prioritised ahead of coast, marine and wetland areas. Generally a combination of community and contracted labour was used during the clean-up. Some material was salvaged for temporary shelter and recycling, however, the majority of the waste was disposed of at Tafaigata landfill. An overall strategy and strong leadership in waste management activities was absent – leading to a string of discrete, nonstrategic and varied interventions. There appeared to have been no overall coordination, and no waste management strategy from the international community, or the Government of Samoa’s Ministry of Natural Resource and Environment (MNRE). The MNRE lacked the physical and financial resources and oversight to deal with the waste efficiently and holistically. In the future a more coordinated approach would be beneficial. Key waste programme components such as financing, waste management programme implementation and environmental standards varied between organisations and there was little cohesion and consistency. This resulted in mixed and incomplete outcomes from the clean-up works. Inconsistencies included: varying levels of recycling; expectations on community participation in debris cleanup (paid and non-paid; waste segregation vs. mixed waste collection); different standards in clean-up service provided between villages...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of sediment and water contamination from legacy waste {{is a significant}} problem in Antarctica. Although several reports have noted that there are contaminated sites at the abandoned Wilkes Station, a systematic attempt to assess the spatial scale of the problem has not been made, making development of <b>clean-up</b> or preservation <b>programmes</b> difficult. A contaminated site assessment for the old Wilkes Station and surrounds is presented in this paper. The Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) sediment and water quality guidelines and background concentration levels (BCL) {{were used to assess}} the extent of contamination across Clark Peninsula. Of 67 sediment sites sampled, 72 % were contaminated with at least one metal or metalloid, with values exceeding the ANZECC ISQG-High or 2 x BCL. Moreover, 19 % were contaminated with four or more metals/metalloids. Of the 93 water samples collected, all but one was contaminated with at least one metal/metalloid concentration exceeding the guidelines, and 96 % were contaminated with two or more metals/metalloids. For hydrocarbons in sediment and water, most samples were below quantitation limits. There is a complex pattern of contamination across Clark Peninsula that needs to be considered in future waste treatment, containment or removal operations, and for protection of heritage items. 16 page(s...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{looks at}} a {{prominent}} example of planning for sustainable development in Rio de Janeiro, namely the Guanabara Bay <b>Clean-up</b> <b>Programme.</b> We examine {{the role of the}} Programme against the background of socio-economic and spatial trends in the last decade, identifying patterns of segregation and polarization on these levels. Beyond the fact that such patterns follow urban development tendencies under the impact of globalization which also have been documented elsewhere, we are interested here in looking at how the Programme has contributed to reinforce existing trends of spatial and socio-economic segregation through the way in which sanitation infrastructure has been implemented in different areas of the city. We look here at two neighbourhoods located {{on opposite sides of the}} same, heavily polluted Guanabara Bay. The first is Icaraí, a high-income area where the beach, despite being polluted and being closed for bathing for many years, has remained a recreational amenity. The second is Conjunto Esperança, a low-income community which has been closed off from the bay by series of urban interventions, such as the free-way containing the main traffic towards Rio de Janeiro International Airport and Baixada Fluminense region. The Programme interventions in both areas have contributed to reinforce patterns of spatial segregation, both between neighbourhoods of different socio...|$|E
40|$|On May 16 2006 the {{government}} of Zimbabwe embarked on a <b>clean-up</b> <b>programme</b> of urban centres, destroying informal human settlements and informal businesses. This operation, which {{the government}} called operation "Restore Order", resulted in the displacement of nearly one million people and left thousands of families homeless. This study is a discussion and {{an analysis of the}} coverage of the clean-up operation by two of Zimbabwe's leading Sunday newspapers, The Sunday Mail and The Standard. The Sunday Mail is owned by the Zimbabwe government and The Standard is privately owned and perceived to be oppositional to the current Zimbabwe government. The two newspapers, therefore, covered the clean-up operation from different perspectives and often presented conflicting reports explaining why the clean-up operation was carried out and the extent of its impact on the lives of millions of Zimbabweans. The chosen research approach is the Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) framework as developed by Fairclough (1995). Using CDA, this study seeks to find out and expose the underlying ideological struggles for hegemony between different social and political groups in Zimbabwe and how the newspapers became actors in this process. This process is made possible by looking at how news reporting is organised in the two newspapers, issues of language use, sourcing and external factors that influenced the coverage of the operation. ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of an integral water management policy, the sanitation of the water courses in the Flemish region is developed through small-scale projects to study the overall environment of local river catchments. Indeed, the complex processes need a multidisciplinary approach to guarantee successful implementation of water resources strategies. In the Zwalm catchment, a small river basin situated in the interfluve between the upper Scheldt and Dender rivers in the southwest of Flanders, this basic philosophy is explored in a pilot project. Local morphological circumstances require a study {{that focuses on the}} sediment transport and its management. A combination of sand/silt river beds, severe land erosion and discrete flood flows indicate the importance of sediment management in the <b>clean-up</b> <b>programme,</b> Sedimentation and transport of fine materials, as a favourite adhesive medium for pollutants, lead to general pollution of both water and river bed in the downstream reaches. Based on extensive field recordings on sediment transport in the river channels, total suspended load in the downstream water reach (15600 t yeat(- 1)) is revealed to be 100 times higher than the bed load in the corresponding Zwalm channel (140 t year(- 1)). Upstream steep areas (45 % of the catchment surface) deliver about 65 % of the total sediment load. It is clearly identified that, during very limited time periods, discrete flood events transport {{the main part of the}} total sediment volume...|$|E
40|$|Legacy {{waste is}} a {{significant}} problem in Antarctica. This is particularly the case where waste generated on stations prior to the 1980 s was incinerated, placed in landfill sites or disposed of at sea. Although several Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) reports from the 1980 s recognise that there are contaminated sites at the abandoned Wilkes Station, {{there has been no}} systematic attempt to classify the waste or define the spatial scale of the problem, making development of strategic and systematic <b>clean-up</b> or preservation <b>programmes</b> difficult. This article reports on a project to classify the waste remaining on Clark Peninsula using categories listed in Annex III, Article 2 of the Madrid Protocol (1991). 536 sites with one or more waste items have been identified in nine categories that are based on the degree of waste hazard, recyclability, heritage value and waste management potential. Fuel drums, petroleum hydrocarbons waste and contaminated sediment occur at 38 % of the sites. This waste includes around 1020 partially full fuel drums. Heritage items that illustrate expedition life at Wilkes occur at about 10 % of the sites. Solid, non-combustible waste, including scrap metal, copper wire and pipe, and steel mechanical parts, occurs at 25 % of the sites. Potentially hazardous or harmful waste including electrical batteries, plastics including fuel bladders, food remains, treated timber and containers containing persistent compounds occur at 28 % of sites. Although hazardous substances, such as caustic soda, explosives and asbestos, occur at only 9 % of the sites, these items represent significant contamination and heath issues for the sites and for visiting explorers. Any future clean-up operations will require more than just the physical removal of waste. Preservation, removal and treatment of various types of waste from Wilkes will be required as part of a multi-year, multi-strategy approach. 20 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Microorganisms {{accumulate}} at soil surfaces {{where many}} xenobiotic carbon and energy sources are concentrated. At this soil-water interface interactive microbial communities develop {{and are often}} contained within extracellular polysaccharide structures known as biofilms. These microenvironments are sites of comparatively high microbial activity and the many complex interactions that take place within them need to be better understood before rational approaches to soil bioremediation can be developed. Xenobiotic bioavailability at soil surfaces and within biofilms is a dynamic property and determined by {{the properties of the}} soil, the organic in question, and the composition and activities of the microbial community. In addition, the period to which the soil has been exposed to the contaminant and the horizon in which the xenobiotic or its metabolites are located are important factors to consider in any <b>clean-up</b> <b>programme.</b> Traditional methods for accelerating pollutant transformations in soil have had only mixed success and both stimulation of the indigenous population and augmentation with novel bacteria or fungi often fail. However, newer molecular techniques for assessing the genotypic and phenotypic potential of a polluted soil are providing information that will permit a more rational approach to remediation. Some of these methods, which involve DNA and RNA extraction and analysis, are evaluated and novel ways, of selecting soil- and biofilm-competent inoculants are presented. Finally, the problems associated with studying and manipulating such a diverse environment as soil are discussed both in the narrow context of the needs of bioremediation and the broader context of understanding infinitely complex systems...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the recent soil Lead Abatement Strategy (LAS) in Boolaroo, New South Wales, Australia, {{that was designed}} to "achieve a reduction in human exposure to lead dust contamination in surface soils". The abatement programme addressed legacy contamination of residential areas following closure of lead smelting operations in 2003 at the Pasminco Cockle Creek Smelter (PCCS). The principal objective of the LAS was to "cap and cover" lead-contaminated soils within the urban environment surrounding the PCCS. Soil lead concentrations of 2500 - 5000 mg/kg were scheduled for removal and replacement, while concentrations between 1500 and 2500 mg/kg were replaced only under limited circumstances. To date, there has been no industry, government or independent assessment of the <b>clean-up</b> <b>programme</b> that involved > 2000 homes in the township of Boolaroo. Thus, by measuring post-abatement soil lead concentrations in Boolaroo, this study addresses this knowledge gap and evaluates the effectiveness of the LAS for reducing the potential for lead exposure. Soil lead concentrations above the Australian residential soil health investigation level value for residential soils (300 mg/kg) were identified at {{all but one of the}} residential properties examined (n = 19). Vacuum dust samples (n = 17) from the same homes had a mean lead concentration of 495 mg/kg (median 380 mg/kg). Bio-accessibility testing revealed that lead in household vacuum dust was readily accessible (% bio-accessible) (mean = 92 %, median = 90 %), demonstrating that the risk of exposure via this pathway remains. Assessment of a limited number of properties (n = 8) where pre-abatement soil lead levels were available for comparison showed they were not statistically different to post-abatement. Although the LAS did not include treatment of non-residential properties, sampling of community areas including public sports fields, playgrounds and schools (n = 32) was undertaken to determine the contamination legacy in these areas. Elevated mean soil lead concentrations were found across public lands: sports fields = 5130 mg/kg (median = 1275 mg/kg), playgrounds and schools = 812 mg/kg (median = 920 mg/kg) and open space = 778 mg/kg (median = 620 mg/kg). Overall, the study results show that the LAS programme that was dominated by a "cap and cover" approach to address widespread lead contamination was inadequate for mitigating current and future risk of lead exposures. 14 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The 2009 Black Saturday Bushfires in Victoria, Australia killed 173 {{people and}} {{affected}} 430, 000 hectares of land. Before communities {{could begin to}} rebuild the tonnes of burnt and potentially hazardous debris had to be removed. This report reviews the overall waste management process following the bushfires. In particular the report focuses on the State and Commonwealth sponsored demolition and debris removal contract. Data for the analysis {{is based on a}} literature review and interviews with professionals and community members involved with or affected by the bushfire waste. Overall the demolition and debris removal response to the Bushfires was successful. The government sponsored clean-up was hailed as the best post-bushfire government initiative. Aspects of the <b>clean-up</b> <b>programme</b> such as the opportunity to salvage personal items before demolition were highly successful. Although there had been little prior planning for how to deal with disaster waste on this scale, there was a collective response to move with urgency towards a common goal: to remove public health hazards and to get communities into the rebuilding process as quickly as possible. To meet this goal, five key decisions were made: • Establishment of VBRRA. • Single waste classification for waste handling procedures. • Decision for government to fund the demolition and debris removal on private property. • Letting a single contract for the above works. • Construction of a new landfill cell. For each decision, decision makers needed to balance the environmental, economic and social drivers to meet the above goal. For example a decision was made to stream-line standard peace-time processes such as asbestos handling and disposal in order to remove the hazard quickly and facilitate the rebuild. With limited time to assess possible impacts and outcomes for decisions there was inevitably an elevated risk due to uncertainty associated with the decision-making. The legal frameworks used to meet the debris and demolition requirements were simple and effective. The organisational structures in this event were unplanned for but collaborative and efficient. The major deficiency identified was the lack of ‘peace-time’ solid waste managers involved in the decision-making process on the waste management strategy. The reactive response to the Bushfire clean-up was largely successful, however, the response would have benefited from greater prior planning. Planning is necessary to give decision-makers the tools and information necessary to make good decisions after any given event. Flexible organisational, legal and financial frameworks and suitable impact assessment techniques are essential. For example pre-determining the extent of public financial assistance to the public, relative to disaster impact, and providing prosecution protection for decision- makers, would help to reduce pressure on decision-makers {{at the time of the}} disaster. With these in place, decisions can be made more efficiently and in a well coordinated and consultative manner. Many of the delays in the Bushfire response could have been avoided if pre-event planning, focussed around anticipated decision points, had been carried out. Communication at all levels is the key component of this entire process. ii It is hoped that those involved in waste management and other disaster responses take the lessons learned here and develop effective plans and strategies for responses in the future...|$|E
