40|$|A {{new test}} stand has been {{developed}} at the Idaho National Laboratory for multi-kW testing of solid oxide electrolysis stacks. This test stand will initially be operated at the 4 KW scale. The 4 kW tests will include two 60 -cell stacks operating in parallel in a single hot zone. The stacks are internally manifolded with an inverted-U flow pattern and an active area of 100 cm 2 per cell. Process gases {{to and from the}} two stacks are distributed from common inlet/outlet tubing using a custom base manifold unit that also serves as the bottom <b>current</b> <b>collector</b> <b>plate.</b> The solid oxide cells incorporate a negative-electrode-supported multi-layer design with nickel-zirconia cermet negative electrodes, thin-film yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolytes, and multi-layer lanthanum ferrite-based positive electrodes. Treated metallic interconnects with integral flow channels separate the cells and electrode gases. Sealing is accomplished with compliant mica-glass seals. A spring-loaded test fixture is used for mechanical stack compression. Due to the power level and the large number of cells in the hot zone, process gas flow rates are high and heat recuperation is required to preheat the cold inlet gases upstream of the furnace. Heat recuperation is achieved by means of two inconel tube-in-tube counter-flow heat exchangers. A current density of 0. 3 A/cm 2 will be used for these tests, resulting in a hydrogen production rate of 25 NL/min. Inlet steam flow rates will be set to achieve a steam utilization value of 50 %. The 4 kW test will be performed for a minimum duration of 1000 hours in order to document the long-term durability of the stacks.

40|$|Our {{model of}} a direct {{methanol}} fuel cell with straight channels is extended {{to take into account}} finite conductivity of <b>current</b> <b>collector</b> <b>plates</b> and local contact resistances. Co-flow conditions are assumed and the two cases are considered: (i) when load resistor is connected at the inlet of the feed channels and (ii) when it is connected at the outlet. In both cases voltage loss in the plates induces growth of current production close to the point of load connection. The increase in local current j is accompanied by the growth of local polarization voltages eta(a) and eta(c) of the anode and the cathode sides, respectively. Moving the point of load connection one can change the distribution of j, eta(a) and eta(c) along the channel. Local "spot" of contact resistance decreases local current and polarization voltages; in the rest part of the cell these values increase. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A {{major factor}} in the stratospheric {{collection}} process is the relative density of particles at the collection altitude. With <b>current</b> aircraft-borne <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> geometries, one potential extraterrestrial particle of about 10 micron diameter is collected approximately every hour. However, a new design for the <b>collector</b> <b>plate,</b> termed the Large Area Collector (LAC), allows a factor of 10 improvement in collection efficiency over current conventional geometry. The implementation of LAC design on future stratospheric collection flights will provide many opportunities for additional data on both terrestrial and extraterrestrial phenomena. With the improvement in collection efficiency, LAC's may provide a suitable number of potential extraterrestrial particles in one short flight of between 4 and 8 hours duration. Alternatively, total collection periods of approximately 40 hours enhance the probability that rare particles can be retrieved from the stratosphere. This latter approach is of great value for the cosmochemist who may wish to perform sophisticated analyses on interplanetary dust greater than a picogram. The former approach, involving short duration flights, may also provide invaluable data on the source of many extraterrestrial particles. The time dependence of particle entry to the collection altitude is an important parameter which may be correlated with specific global events (e. g., meteoroid streams) provided the collection time is known to an accuracy of 2 hours...|$|R
40|$|The {{technical}} features of solid-electrode batteries (e. g., high energy density, relatively low capital cost ($/kWh)) and flow batteries (e. g., long cycle life, design flexibility) are highly complementary. It is therefore extremely desirable to integrate their advantages {{into a single}} storage device for large-scale energy storage applications where lifetime cost ($/kW-h/cycle) is an extremely important parameter. Here, we demonstrate a non-Li-based-flow battery concept that replaces the aqueous solution of redox-active molecules found in typical redox flow batteries with suspensions of hydrophilic carbon particles (“solid suspension electrodes”) coated with earth-abundant redox-active metals. The solid suspension electrodes charge by depositing earth-abundant redox-active metals onto the carbon particle suspension, which are then stripped during discharge operation. The electrical contact to the solid suspension electrodes is fed through fixed redox-inert hydrophobic carbon <b>current</b> <b>collectors</b> through “contact charge transfer” mechanism. The hydrophobicity of the <b>current</b> <b>collectors</b> prevents direct <b>plating</b> of redox-active metals onto their surfaces.

40|$|Water {{is vital}} for human activity. In the past {{abundant}} fresh water supplies {{were believed to be}} limitless. In the last two decades dwindling reserves of freely accessible water at the surface and subsurface environment have raised community awareness about the need to ensure that industrial production operates in a sustainable way that won’t constrain the development and sustainability of regional cities and towns that draw on downstream ground waters for their potable and non potable water requirements. In this paper, a method of augmenting the widely practiced evaporation pond approach is investigated for disposing of brine wastewaters to improve the sustainability of industrial operators employing this practice. The approach involves the adoption of solar <b>plate</b> <b>collector</b> technology. The solar technology referred to as unglazed transpired collectors (UTCs). It may be considered a hybrid concept as it’s a UTC except inclined like a typical solar <b>collector</b> <b>plate.</b> A pilot scale <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit was designed and constructed to evaluate the enhanced evaporation capabilities of a <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit (UTCs). The experimental program covered a 14 month study period from June 2005 to August, 2006. This research investigated the ability to enhance evaporation using three different brine concentrations (3. 5 % NaCl, 7. 0 % NaCl and 12. 5 % NaCl), and three film heights (0. 15 mm, 0. 2 mm and 0. 3 mm) over a 14 month experimental period between June 2005 and August 2006. The research investigated the relationship between key weather parameters, solar irradiation (MJ/m 2 /d), wind speed (m/s), ambient air temperature (°C), and relative humidity (%), and enhanced evaporation and <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> evaporation from the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit. Data analysis found weather conditions low in relative humidity (less than 40 %), high in total incident solar radiation (greater than 20 MJ/m 2 /d), steady, constant wind speeds (between 1. 1 and 1. 3 m/s), and high daily average air temperatures (greater than 25 °C) would generally produce evaporation enhancement ratio (EER) results between 2. 0 and 3. 0 for brine solutions with concentrations up to 7. 0 % NaCl. The peak EER result of 3. 01 (achieved during summer) equated to the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit achieving a rate of evaporation 301 % higher than an equivalent surface area of evaporation pond containing similar brine wastewater and subject to similar weather conditions. The mean EER result over the 14 month sampling period was 1. 52.
