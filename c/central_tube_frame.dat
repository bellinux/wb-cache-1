50|$|Swiss {{motorcycle}} tuner and Royal Enfield distributor Fritz W. Egli made {{a custom}} Bullet using Egli's <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> <b>frame</b> constructed from nickel-plated chromium-molybdenum steel, and a longer stroke crankshaft (105 mm) engine with special main bearings, dry clutch, timing belt primary drive, and 36 mm Keihin flat-slide carburettors.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{deficiencies}} in the original design, Frederick asked the then 77-year-old Hans Ledwinka, the former Tatra engineer, to design a robust chassis for the car. The result was a <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> <b>frame</b> and four wheels - {{in contrast to the}} original three-wheeled Brütsch. Frederick then saw himself no longer obligated to pay royalties to Brütsch, which led to a court case, which Frederick won. The judges recognising that the original Brütsch construction was both useless and dangerous.|$|E
50|$|The close seating {{arrangement}} at 4MH was also by design. To achieve {{the lowest possible}} car silhouette, the seats were within and not located on the wheel arches. Consequently, there was only space in center of the vehicle. Stability in the area was compared with the Saurer M6 and M8, despite the almost identical <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> <b>frame</b> means substantially better. Regarding off-road capability, he stood by his multi-wheeled brothers M6 and M8 in nothing. While pulling heavy trailer loads in {{the grounds of the}} rear engine also played out his trump card.One is on display at the Schweizerische Militärmuseum Full and one in the :de:Zuger Depot Technikgeschichte.|$|E
