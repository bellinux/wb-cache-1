40|$|Using a {{dynamically}} scaled robotic wing, {{we studied}} the aerodynamic torque generation of flapping wings during roll, pitch, and yaw rotations of the stroke plane. The total torque {{generated by a}} wing pair with symmetrical motions was previously known as flapping <b>counter-torques</b> (FCTs). For all three types of rotation, stroke-averaged FCTs act opposite to the directions of rotation and are collinear with the rotational axes. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} magnitude of FCTs is linearly dependent on both the flapping frequency and the angular velocity. We also compared the results with predictions by a mathematical model based on quasi-steady analyses, where we show that FCTs can be described through consideration of the asymmetries of wing velocity and the effective angle of attack caused by each type of rotation.

50|$|Other {{authors were}} {{unsatisfied}} {{with the idea}} that torques and <b>counter-torques</b> arise only because different inertial frames are chosen. Their aim was to replace the standard expressions for momentum and force and thus equilibrium by manifestly Lorentz covariant ones from the outset. So when there is no torque in the rest frame of the considered object, then there are no torques in other frames as well. This is in analogy to the 4/3 problem of the electromagnetic mass of electrons, where similar methods were employed by Enrico Fermi (1921) and Fritz Rohrlich (1960): In the standard formulation of relativistic dynamics the hyperplanes of simultaneity of any observer can be used, while in the Fermi/Rohrlich definition the hyperplane of simultaneity of the object's rest frame should be used. According to Janssen, deciding between Laue's standard model and such alternatives is merely a matter of convention.|$|R

5000|$|Flapping <b>counter-torque</b> is a {{ubiquitous}} passive rotational damping {{effect in}} flapping flight that arises from world frame {{differences in the}} speed of flapping wings during turns. During a turns, flapping that is symmetrical (in velocity and speed) in the body frame of the animal is not symmetrical (in velocity or speed) in the lab frame.|$|E
50|$|The {{operating}} {{point of a}} system is the intersection point of the torque-speed curve of drive and machine. Both devices are linked with a shaft so the speed is always identical. The drive creates the torque which rotates both devices. The machine creates the <b>counter-torque,</b> e.g. by being a moved device which needs permanent energy or a wheel turning against the static friction of the track.|$|E
50|$|In {{a vehicle}} which relies on gravity in some way, weight {{distribution}} directly affects {{a variety of}} vehicle characteristics, including handling, acceleration, traction, and component life. For this reason weight distribution varies with the vehicle's intended usage. For example, a drag car maximizes traction at the rear axle while countering the reactionary pitch-up torque. It generates this <b>counter-torque</b> by placing {{a small amount of}} counterweight at a great distance forward of the rear axle.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{stabilize}} the yaw bearing against rotation a means of braking is necessary. One of the simplest ways to realize that task is to apply a constant small <b>counter-torque</b> at the yaw drives in order to eliminate the backlash between gear-rim and yaw drive pinions and to prevent the nacelle from oscillating due to the rotor rotation. This operation however greatly reduces {{the reliability of the}} electric yaw drives, therefore the most common solution is the implementation of a hydraulically actuated disk brake.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1993, aerobraking {{was used}} during the {{extended}} Venusian mission of the Magellan spacecraft. It was used to circularize the orbit of the spacecraft {{in order to increase}} the precision of the measurement of the gravity field. The entire gravity field was mapped from the circular orbit during a 243-day cycle of the extended mission. During the termination phase of the mission, a [...] "windmill experiment" [...] was performed: Atmospheric molecular pressure exerts a torque via the then windmill-sail-like oriented solar cell wings, the necessary <b>counter-torque</b> to keep the sonde from spinning is measured.|$|E
50|$|The {{middle point}} on the curve in the third picture {{on the right is}} an {{unstable}} point, too. However the above-mentioned assumptions are not valid here. Torque and speed are the same but in case the speed will be increased only little then the torque of the drive will be much higher than the <b>counter-torque</b> of the machine. The same but vice versa applies when reducing the speed. For this reason this operating point does not have a stabilizing effect on the speed. The speed will run away to the left or {{the right side of the}} point and the drive will run stable there.|$|E
50|$|In {{the lower}} right picture the {{electrical}} drive (AC motor) moves a conveyor belt. This type of machine has a nearly constant <b>counter-torque</b> over {{the whole range of}} speed. By choosing the incorrect drive (incorrect in size and type) there will be three possible operating points with the necessary working torque. Naturally the operating point with the highest speed is needed because only there will be the highest mechanical power (which is proportional to torque times speed). At the other operating points the majority of the electrical power (proportional only to the torque) will be only converted into heat inside the drive. Despite the bad power balance the drive can also overheat this way. In the example shown in picture three the desired right operating point with same torque but higher speed (and therefore higher power) cannot be reached alone after starting the drive. The reason is the technically induced decrease of the drive characteristics {{in the middle of the}} curve. The speed will reach this area but not increase further. In case of such machines with constant torques a coupling can be used to prevent stopping during start up, it should be rotation speed dependent. (Of course a motor bigger in size would also do, but this is not as economical). With the coupling the counter torque will only be introduced when the load-less drive has reached a speed outside of the unstable working point. Then the drive can safely speed up. Alternatively a drive with an adequate characteristic can be chosen. In the past shunt-motors have been used for this purpose, nowadays asynchronous AC motors are being used or AC motors in combination with a variable frequency drive.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the counter-force of prosthetic screws {{before and after}} the rectification procedure of the seating base of prosthetic framework screws. Methods: With a metal matrix containing three replicas of conical abutments (Micro-Unit; Conexão) placed at 10 mm from center to center, ten multiple cast structures were made of a titanium monoblock. The multiple cast structures were fastened onto the metal matrix abutments with a torque of 10 NCm. The screwing sequence was performed from the central pillar towards the distal ones. The force (Ncm) necessary for <b>counter-torque</b> was evaluated using a digital torque meter (TQ 3000; Lutron, Taipei, Taiwan). This procedure was carried out before and after rectification of the seating base of the prosthetic screws, by means of a manual rectifier tip (Conexão Sistemas de Prótese, São Paulo, Brazil). The mean <b>counter-torque</b> values were calculated for each structure before and after rectification. The t-Test for paired samples was used to compare the evaluated situations. Results: Significant difference was observed between the mean <b>counter-torque</b> force value of the prosthetic screws before (5. 78 ± 1. 03 Ncm) and after (7. 06 ± 0. 62 Ncm) the rectification procedures (p< 0. 01). Conclusion: The rectifying process of the seating base significantly increased the values of force required to <b>counter-torque</b> the prosthetic screws of cast implant-retained multiple frameworks...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The use {{of natural}} {{substances}} and micronutritional approaches has been suggested as a therapeutic alternative to benefit the bone healing associated with no side effects. Nevertheless, the influence of micronutritional interventions with therapeutic proprieties on the bone repair {{has yet to be}} intensely evaluated, and no evidence is available exploring the impact of micronutrient supplementation on the peri-implant bone healing. Objective This study investigated the effect of micronutrients supplementation on the bone repair around implants. Material and Methods One screw-shaped titanium implant was inserted in each tibia of each rat, which were assigned to: daily administration, for 30 d, of the placebo solution (Placebo group-n: 18) or micronutrients supplementation (Micronutrients group-n: 18), based on calcium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D 3 intake. After, the animals were sacrificed. One of the implants was removed by applying a <b>counter-torque</b> force to evaluate the force to rupture the bone-implant interface. The other implant was evaluated by microcomputed tomography (CT) examination to determine the bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and the bone volume (BV/TV). Results No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups for both <b>counter-torque</b> values and microCT parameters (p> 0. 05). Conclusion Within the limits of this study, micronutrients supplementation did not provide additional benefits to the bone healing around dental implants...|$|E

40|$|The {{triangular}} quadrotor is a novel, {{more efficient}} configuration of quadrotor aircraft {{that uses a}} single large central rotor for lift and three smaller rotors for <b>counter-torque</b> and manoeuvering. Early experiments exhibited a precession effect due to the uncompensated gyroscopics of the main rotor. In this paper we discuss two techniques to fix this problem: feedback linearisation and a mechanical flapping joint. Simulations indicate that, contrary to expectations, feedback linearisation is not viable due to delays in the control system. The rotor flapping approach is {{shown to be a}} more effective solution, both in simulation and flight experiments...|$|E

40|$|Fruit flies alter flight {{direction}} by generating rapid, stereotyped turns, called saccades. The {{successful implementation of}} these quick turns requires a well-tuned orchestration of neural circuits, musculo-skeletal mechanics, and aerodynamic forces. The changes in wing motion required to accomplish a saccade are quite subtle, as dictated by the inertial dynamics of the fly's body. A fly first generates torque to begin accelerating in the intended direction, but then must quickly create <b>counter-torque</b> to decelerate. Several lines of evidence suggest that the initial turn is initiated by visual expansion, whereas the subsequent counter-turn is triggered by the gyroscopic halteres. This integrated analysis indicates how the functional organization of neural circuits controlling behavior is rigidly constrained by the physical interaction between an animal and the external world...|$|E
40|$|Free-flight body {{dynamics}} and wing kinematics {{were collected from}} recordings of continuous, low-speed, multi-wingbeat yaw turns in hawkmoths (Manduca sexta) using stereo videography. These data were {{used to examine the}} effects of rotational damping arising from interactions between the body rotation and flapping motion (flapping <b>counter-torque,</b> FCT) on continuous turning. The moths were found to accelerate during downstroke, then decelerate during upstroke by an amount consistent with FCT damping. Wing kinematics related to turning were then analysed in a simulation of hawkmoth flight; results were consistent with the observed acceleration–deceleration pattern. However, an alternative wing kinematic which produced more continuous and less damped accelerations was found in the simulation. These findings demonstrate that (i) FCT damping is detectable in the dynamics of continuously turning animals and (ii) FCT-reducing kinematics do exist but were not employed by turning moths, possibly because within-wingbeat damping simplifies control of turning by allowing control systems to target angular velocity rather than acceleration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: GTM have {{developed}} a primary torque standard which covers the range from 1 Nm to 1 kNm with a single load frame and only one weight stack per direction of operation. The design comprises a double-sided lever, supported on strain-controlled elastic hinges, a binary weight stack of exchange disk design for each direction, mounting accessories for the transducer under test and a <b>counter-torque</b> drive with servo-controller. Compared to conventional types with air bearings and a multitude of several stacks, the chosen design offers distinctive advantages: Higher reliability of the lever support, less complicated auxiliary systems, easier method of operation, low overall height. Calculations show that the parasitic moment of the crossed hour-glass shaped springs for the lever support can be controlled to less than 10 - 5 Nm for a 1 kNm machine, and that the uncertainty of lever length falls within a 20 ppm band, including the equality of both sides. Using the same principle of elastic hinges, the overall torque range can be increased to stretch from 0. 1 Nm to over 20 kNm, with only two separate load frames...|$|E
40|$|The small rotor {{sizes of}} quadrotors and {{multirotors}} makes them intrinsically less energy efficient than a traditional helicopter {{with a large}} single rotor. However, the quadrotor configuration 2 ̆ 7 s innate simplicity and inexpensive construction recommends its use in many aerial robotics applications. We present a four-rotor configuration that merges the simplicity of a quadrotor with the energy efficiency of a helicopter, while improving manoeuvering rotor bandwidth. This class of aircraft, called a ‘Y 4 ’ or ‘triangular quadrotor’, consists of a single fixed-pitch main rotor with three smaller rotors on booms that provide both <b>counter-torque</b> and manoeuvering control. Our analysis indicates that a Y 4 may provide a 20 per cent reduction in hovering power required, compared with a similarly sized conventional quadrotor.

We present a dynamic model and demonstrate experimentally that the aircraft can be stabilised in flight with PID control...|$|E
40|$|Flapping fliers such as {{insects and}} birds depend on passive {{translational}} and rotational damping to terminate quick maneuvers {{and to provide}} a source of partial stability in an otherwise unstable dynamic system. Additionally, passive translational and rotational damping reduce the amount of active kinematic changes that must be made to terminate maneuvers and maintain stability. The study of flapping-induced damping phenomena also improves the understanding of micro air vehicle (MAV) dynamics needed for the synthesis of effective flight control strategies. Aerodynamic processes which create passive translational and rotational damping {{as a direct result of}} symmetric flapping with no active changes in wing kinematics have been previously studied and were termed flapping counter-force (FCF) and flapping <b>counter-torque</b> (FCT), respectively. ^ In this first study of FCF measurement in air, FCF generation is measured using a pendulum system designed to isolate and measure the relationship of translational flapping-induced damping with wingbeat frequency for a 2. 86 gram mechanical flapper equipped with real cicada wings. Analysis reveals that FCF generation and wingbeat frequency are directly proportional, as expected from previous work. The quasi-steady FCF model using Blade-Element-Theory is used as an estimate for translational flapping-induced damping. In most cases, the model proves to be accurate in predicting the relationship between flapping-induced damping and wingbeat frequency. “Forward-backward” motion proves to have the strongest flapping-induced damping while “up-down” motion has the weakest. ...|$|E
40|$|Manipulating a cup by {{the handle}} {{requires}} compensating for the torque {{induced by the}} moment of the mass of the cup relative to the location of the handle. In the present study, we investigated the control strategy of subjects asked to perform grip-lift movements with an object with center of mass located away from the grip axis. Participants were asked to lift the manipulandum with a two-fingers precision grip and stabilize it in front of a visual target. Subjects showed a gradual and slow adaptation of the grip-force scaling across trials: the grip force tended to decrease slowly, and the temporal coordination between grip-force and load-torque rates displayed gradually, better-coordinated patterns. Importantly, this adaptation was much slower than the stabilization of the same parameters measured either when no torque came into play or after previous adaptation to the presence of a torque. In contrast, the maximum rotation induced by the torque was controlled efficiently after only few trials, and an unexpected decrease in the tangential torque produced significant overcompensation. An unexpected increase in torque produced a consistent opposite effect. This shows that the compensation for the dynamic torque was based on an anticipatory, dynamic <b>counter-torque</b> produced by the arm and wrist motor commands. The comparatively slow stabilization of grip-force control suggests a specific adaptation process engaged by the presence of the torque. This paradigm, including tangential torques, clearly constitutes a powerful tool to extract the adaptive component of grip control during object manipulation...|$|E
40|$|We used {{videography}} {{to investigate}} direct lateral maneuvers, i. e. ‘sideslips’, of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. M. sexta sideslip by rolling their entire body and wings to reorient their net force vector. During sideslip they increase net aerodynamic force by flapping with greater amplitude, (in both wing elevation and sweep), {{allowing them to}} continue to support body weight while rolled. To execute the roll maneuver we observed in sideslips, they use an asymmetric wing stroke; increasing the pitch of the roll-contralateral wing pair, while decreasing that of the roll-ipsilateral pair. They also increase the wing sweep amplitude of, and decrease the elevation amplitude of, the contralateral wing pair relative to the ipsilateral pair. The roll maneuver unfolds in a stairstep manner, with orientation changing more during downstroke than upstroke. This is due to smaller upstroke wing pitch angle asymmetries as well as increased upstroke flapping <b>counter-torque</b> from left-right differences in global reference frame wing velocity about the moth's roll axis. Rolls are also opposed by stabilizing aerodynamic moments from lateral motion, such that rightward roll velocity will be opposed by rightward motion. Computational modeling using blade-element approaches confirm the plausibility of a causal linkage between the previously mentioned wing kinematics and roll/sideslip. Model results also predict high degrees of axial and lateral damping. On the time scale of whole and half wing strokes, left-right wing pair asymmetries directly relate to the first, but not second, derivative of roll. Collectively, these results strongly support a roll-based sideslip {{with a high degree}} of roll damping in M. sexta...|$|E
40|$|Finned {{bodies of}} {{revolution}} firing lateral jets in flight may experience lower spin rates than predicted. This reduction in spin rate {{is a result}} of vortices generated by the interaction between the lateral jets and freestream air flowing past the body. The vortices change the pressure distribution on the fins, inducing a counter torque that opposes the desired spin. Wind tunnel data measuring roll torque and fin pressures were collected for a full-scale model at varying angle of attack, roll angle, airspeed, and jet strength. The current analysis builds upon previously written code that computes torque by integrating pressure over the fin surfaces at 0 {sup o} angle of attack. The code was modified to investigate the behavior of counter torque at different angles of attack and roll angles as a function of J, the ratio of jet dynamic pressure to freestream dynamic pressure. Numerical error analysis was applied to all data to assist with interpretation of results. Results show that agreement between balance and fin pressure counter torque at 0 {sup o} angle of attack was not as close as previously believed. Counter torque at 4 {sup o} angle of attack was higher than at 0 {sup o}, and agreement between balance and fin pressure counter torque was closer. Plots of differential fin pressure coefficient revealed a region of high pressure at the leading edge and an area of low pressure over the center and aft regions of the tapped surface. Large differences in the <b>counter-torque</b> coefficient were found between various freestream dynamic pressures, especially at Mach 0. 95 and 1. 1. Roll angle had significant effect only for cases at angle of attack, where it caused counter torque to change unpredictably...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Implant removal can be {{required}} {{in case of}} malpositions, biological or mechanical failures. This procedure, performed with trephine burs, piezosurgery or <b>counter-torque</b> ratchets, often results in bone defects requiring corrections with advanced regenerative techniques. Few case reports describe implant removal after weakening the bone-implant interface by applying a localized heating to the fixture: however, this procedure must be standardized to obtain a predictable result, avoiding extensive bone damage. Aim of this preliminary study {{is to create a}} high-fidelity numerical model of the bone-implant system, to be validated by in vitro and in vivo tests, for predicting the most appropriate parameters necessary for a minimally invasive implant removal using heating. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 3 -D virtual advanced numerical model was created using ANSYS CFX, in order to simulate the behavior of a bone-implant system under thermal variations. Various parameters can be adjusted to set the model: heating modalities (temperature and/or heat flux, time and source) and system characteristics (implant geometry and material, type of bone). In vitro tests were performed using titanium implants (Premium, Sweden & Martina, Italy - 3. 85 x 8. 5, 10 and 13 mm). Implants were inserted in bovine bone (stabilized at 37 ± 0. 5 °C), and then heated using an endodontic heat carrier (System B, Sybron Endo, USA). Bone temperatures were recorded using thermocouples at different depths (1 mm, middle and apex of implant) and at different distances from the implant [0. 5 mm (T 1), 1 mm (T 2), 1. 5 mm (T 3) and 2 mm (T 4) ]. Non parametric data were analyzed using Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS: The heat carrier, set at 100 °C, was placed in contact with the inner part of the implants for 140 sec. The threshold temperature of 47 °C was reached in T 1 after 65. 2 ± 11. 7 sec, in T 2 after 89. 3 ± 29. 1 sec, in T 3 after 110. 9 ± 29. 6 sec, in T 4 the temperature of 47 °C was never reached within 140 sec. Differences between T 1, T 2, T 3 and T 4 resulted statistically significant (p< 0. 05). Implant length and distance from heat source are factors influencing temperature variations. CONCLUSIONS: From the results of this preliminary study, it seems possible to produce a controlled thermally-induced injury to the bone-implant interface, allowing for a minimally invasive implant removal. Various parameters (implant geometry and material, bone characteristics) must be considered to set temperature and heating duration. In vivo histologic studies are necessary to analyze quality and quantity of bone-implant interface modifications after heat-induced injury, before starting any clinical application...|$|E
