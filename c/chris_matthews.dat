5|$|Damon {{appeared}} on Hardball with <b>Chris</b> <b>Matthews</b> in December 2006, and while discussing the ongoing war in Iraq, {{expressed concern about}} inequities across socioeconomic classes with regard to who in the United States is tasked with the responsibility of fighting wars.

5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna {{gets into}} trouble after she is misquoted in Maxim magazine, {{allegedly}} {{saying that she}} hates the troops. This happened due to Jenna mishearing the interviewer and thinking he meant theater troupes. The resulting outrage prompts Jack to get her an interview on Hardball with <b>Chris</b> <b>Matthews</b> to clear up the confusion over her comments. During the interview, Jenna confuses Osama bin Laden and then-Senator Barack Obama, who was running for the Democratic Party nomination for President. A further attempt to clear Jenna's name backfires when swastikas are accidentally brandished on the TGS with Tracy Jordan stage.|$|E
