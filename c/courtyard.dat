5|$|Passage {{through the}} portal and {{octagonal}} chamber leads into the mosque's central <b>courtyard.</b> The <b>courtyard</b> measures approximately 160 feet by 130 feet, and features high arched galleries surrounding a central brick paved <b>courtyard</b> - a typical feature of imperial Persian mosques in Iran.|$|E
5|$|The present main {{entrance}} to the mosque is the Bab al-Muzayinīn, which opens into the white marble-paved <b>courtyard</b> {{at the opposite end}} of the main prayer hall. To the northeast of the Bab al-Muzayinīn, the <b>courtyard</b> is flanked by the façade of the Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya; the southwestern end of the <b>courtyard</b> leads to the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya. Directly across the <b>courtyard</b> from the {{entrance to the}} Bab al-Muzayinīn is the Bab al-Gindi (Gate of Qaytbay), built in 1495, above which stands the minaret of Qaytbay. Through this gate lies the <b>courtyard</b> of the prayer hall.|$|E

50|$|The <b>courtyards</b> {{within the}} Acropolis each had four sides, {{although}} they were not square. Although the <b>courtyards</b> were all on different vertical levels, this {{appears to have been}} a deliberate decision by planners, and the multi-level nature of the complex was intentionally maintained throughout its period of use, even though the architectural layout, floor levels, and access between <b>courtyards</b> changed over time. The <b>courtyards</b> were enclosed by a labyrinthine mass of multi-level architecture decorated with complex sculpture representing mythic and historical subjects, combined with hieroglyphic texts.|$|R
5|$|After {{passing through}} the massive gate, an {{expansive}} sandstone paved <b>courtyard</b> spreads over an area of 276,000 square feet, and which can accommodate 100,000 worshipers when functioning as an Idgah. The <b>courtyard</b> is enclosed by single-aisled arcades.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, {{following}} the disruption the group were experiencing, Shapira travelled to Europe once again. He hoped {{to secure the}} necessary firman, which would place the <b>courtyard</b> firmly in the Perushim's possession, and also to raise funds {{to cover the costs}} incurred trying to redeem the <b>courtyard.</b> His mission, however, was unsuccessful, as was a later mission attempted in 1829 by Zoref.|$|E

5|$|Still {{awaiting}} imperial {{permission to}} build in the <b>courtyard,</b> the Perushim wished to rely on an old firman given to the Jews in 1623, which stated {{that there could be}} no objection to them building in their own quarters. Having received a supporting document issued by the Qadi of Jerusalem in March 1824, it was possible for them begin rebuilding the dwellings in the <b>courtyard.</b> In practice, however, construction never materialised as they were unable to exercise their authority over the plot of land. This was apparently due to confrontation with the Arab squatters and the local government's disregard of the documents proving their ownership of the <b>courtyard.</b>|$|E

5|$|The castle {{originally}} {{comprised the}} 12th- or 13th-century hall house, which was extended in the 15th century.

The east part of the inner <b>courtyard</b> wall is reduced to foundations, but the base of a round tower and a porter's lodge survive. To the west, the inner <b>courtyard</b> wall remains, enclosing the former service <b>courtyard,</b> which comprises a brewery and bakehouse, with ovens. The east range was added in the 17th century, along the south edge of the outer <b>courtyard.</b> The castle was originally approached from the north, with the entrance moved to the west, along with the 17th-century gate, when the Aberdour railway line was constructed in 1890.|$|E
50|$|The city's basalt {{houses are}} grouped around two large <b>courtyards,</b> {{one to the}} north and the other to the south. One large room in particular, near the east side and joining both <b>courtyards,</b> was {{especially}} large (sides about 7.5 meters long) and roughly square.

5|$|At {{the north}} end of the small <b>courtyard</b> is a chapel and at the {{southern}} end is an esplanade.

Lining the west of the <b>courtyard</b> is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12thcentury, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.|$|E
