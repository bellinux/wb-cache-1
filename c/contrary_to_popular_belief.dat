5|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> some Mycenaean {{representative}} buildings already featured roofs made of fired tiles, as in Gla and Midea.|$|E
5|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> pencil {{leads in}} wooden pencils {{have never been}} made from lead. When the pencil {{originated}} as a wrapped graphite writing tool, the particular type of graphite used was named plumbago (literally, act for lead or lead mockup).|$|E
5|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> it is {{not only}} males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, {{although}} most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, both male and female, may be evicted.|$|E
50|$|Mixed-race {{children}} of Chinese and Malay parents are considered ethnic Malays {{in modern times}} and not Peranakan nor Chinese. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs,</b> some Baba/Nyonya maintained a pure Chinese bloodline while some others intermarried with Malay women.|$|R
50|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs,</b> Asian Americans do openly {{ask for the}} {{professional}} rewards {{they feel that they}} deserve, but despite their overwhelming desire to climb higher on the corporate ladder as well as the American workforce in general, Asians hit barriers that prevent them from doing so.|$|R
25|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs,</b> most child labourers are {{employed}} {{by their parents}} rather than in manufacturing or formal economy. Children who work for pay or in-kind compensation are usually found in rural settings, then urban centres. Less than 3 percent of child labour aged 5–14 across the world work outside their household, or away from their parents.|$|R
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Seringapatam, the Christian captives {{were made to}} forcibly embrace Islam, were tortured, or sentenced to death.. The young men who refused to embrace Islam were disfigured by cutting their noses, upper lips, and ears. They were seated on asses, paraded through the city, and thrown into the dungeons of Seringapatam. Historian Praxy Fernandes, author of Storm over Seringapatam: The Incredible Story of Hyder Ali & Tippu Sultan, states that <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> 40,000 Christians were not kept manacled in the dungeons of Seringapatam.|$|E
5|$|Considered {{by many to}} be {{the most}} {{important}} Scouting site, The Training Ground is where Wood Badge training was historically held and where the Gilwell oak tree is located. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> the Wood Badge beads have never been made of Gilwell Oak. On the Training Ground sits the Gidney Cabin, a memorial to the first Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in 1929. Across from the Gidney Cabin is the Thurman Memorial, in memory of Camp Chief John Thurman.|$|E
5|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> {{great white}} sharks do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to {{not like the}} taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite {{whether or not the}} object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.|$|E
50|$|Courtship {{is used by}} {{a number}} of theorists to explain {{gendering}} processes and sexual identity. Scientific research into courtship began in the 1980s after which time academic researchers started to generate theories about modern dating practices and norms. Both Moore and Perper found that, <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs,</b> courtship is normally triggered and controlled by women, driven mainly by non-verbal behaviours to which men respond.|$|R
50|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> <b>belief</b> of many, a true Tequila {{does not}} contain a worm. It is only in Tequila's brother Mezcal.|$|R
50|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> NorduGrid {{members are}} not {{required}} to provide computing or storage resources; neither offering such resources grants an automatic membership.|$|R
5|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> {{only a few}} {{sharks are}} {{dangerous}} to humans. Out of more than 470 species, only four {{have been involved in}} a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, oceanic whitetip, tiger, and bull sharks. These sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack and kill people. Despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the {{flared end}} {{is known as}} the bell. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> the bell does not amplify the sound; rather, it {{improves}} the uniformity of the instrument's tone for the lowest notes in each register. For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the tone holes and the bell is irrelevant. On basset horns and larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E
5|$|This {{species may}} be active {{during the day}} and at night. However, on bright, sunny days, they are usually found coiled or {{stretched}} out somewhere in the shade. In the morning and on cool days, they can often be seen basking in the sunlight. They often emerge at sunset to warm themselves on warm ground (i.e., sidewalks, roads) and then become very active throughout the night, when they are usually found swimming or crawling. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> they are capable of biting while under water.|$|E
5000|$|Lambesis was {{released}} from prison on probation in December 2016. Earlier within the year, Mancino did an interview primarily discussing Wovenwar, but also spoke about As I Lay Dying. He stated that, <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs,</b> that Hipa, Sgrosso and Gilbert are still technically a part of As I Lay Dying due to their record contract. On Father's day 2017, the bands Facebook page made a post with only one word in it, [...] "Activity", possibly stating that the band might be returning.|$|R
40|$|The United States is {{a nation}} of immigrants. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs,</b> there are many {{positive}} impacts that immigration has on daily life. I will be focusing on {{the economic impact of}} Hispanic immigration. People tend to believe that the new wave of immigration is the cause of the economic problems in our country. With the research I’ve acquired, I’ve {{come to the conclusion that}} this is the wrong view of Hispanic immigration. I will be showing key facts that will support my perspective...|$|R
50|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> <b>belief</b> {{that the}} lines and figures can only be seen from an aircraft, they are also visible from the {{surrounding}} foothills and other high places.|$|R
5|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> Ima did {{not have}} a sister named Ura. Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for {{re-election}} as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this never happened. She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she really had a sister named Ura. The Kansas City Star even invented another sister, Hoosa.|$|E
5|$|Warfare on the North American {{frontier}} was brutal, and {{the killing}} of prisoners, the targeting of civilians, and other atrocities were widespread. The ruthlessness and treachery of the conflict was {{a reflection of a}} growing divide between the separate populations of the British colonists and Native Americans. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> the British government did not issue the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in reaction to Pontiac's War, though the conflict did provide an impetus for the application of the Proclamation's Indian clauses. This proved unpopular with British colonists, and may {{have been one of the}} early contributing factors to the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|In chapter eleven, History, Wade {{demonstrates}} how genetics {{can be related}} to recorded history. An example given is the substantial genetic legacy of Genghis Khan and his male relatives. History correlates with this, as writers of the period stated that he had hundreds of wives. Wade then covers the origins of the British; <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> he writes, neither the Anglo-Saxons nor the Vikings eradicated the indigenous population, as the Y chromosomes common to Celtic speakers are carried by {{a large percentage of the}} male population of Britain. Markers in these Y chromosomes can be linked to the Basques, and he suggests that the British and Irish descend from a refuge in Spain they shared during the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E
50|$|This album also {{includes}} the controversial track, City Bird, which, <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> <b>belief</b> of many, is not, in fact, written by the band's front man, Kevin Barnes.|$|R
50|$|The {{series was}} played on spin-friendly pitches on which India {{had built up}} a {{formidable}} record. India won their eighth straight home win since the defeat of Sri Lanka in 1990-91 and their second successive series whitewash after beating England in 1992-93. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs</b> {{of the time that}} test matches in India produced boring draws, this series meant that the last 12 tests, from Madras in 1987-88 had produced a result- 11 wins for India. Azharuddin joined Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi and Sunil Gavaskar as India's most successful captains, with 9 wins each.|$|R
40|$|Internal reward {{structures}} in firms are often integral {{parts of their}} "culture", and are changed infrequently in comparision to decisions about e. g., output prices. This paper investigates how this feature of firm organization provides a mechanism through which product market competition affects firm's internal efficiency. The design of firms' internal organization is modeled as a choice of an incentive structure between a principal and an agent, with strategic implications for firm's competitive positions on the product market. It is shown that - <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs</b> - there is a negative relation between the competitiveness of the product market and effort incentives...|$|R
5|$|The Buckeye {{was first}} bred and {{developed}} in 1896, by a Warren, Ohio resident named Nettie Metcalf. They {{are the only}} American breed of chicken {{known to have been}} developed by a woman, despite the fact that women were customarily given charge of the household poultry flock throughout much of U.S. history. Metcalf crossbred Barred Plymouth Rocks, Buff Cochins, and some black breasted red games to produce the Buckeye. Her goal was a functional breed that could produce well in the bitter Midwest winters. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief</b> the Buckeye breed was created before the Rhode Island Red breed and Metcalf actually sent birds to the RIR breeders for them to improve their breed.|$|E
5|$|The {{bobsleigh}} {{track was}} built for the 1952 Winter Olympics, where it hosted two bobsleigh events. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> this was not built at Korketrekkeren but as a separate run nearby also starting at Frognerseteren. It was built as a temporary, artificial track with the curves being constructed in snow and then frozen hard to ice. Trial runs were undertaken in 1951 and the bobsleigh course was not used after 1952. Both Olympic events were won by Germany, with Andreas Ostler and Lorenz Nieberl participating in both winning teams. The tobogganing hill hosted the inaugural FIL World Luge Championships 1955, with Norway's Anton Salvesen winning the men's single—the only time in history Norway has won a World Luge Championships medal.|$|E
5|$|Six {{minutes into}} the match, Ronny Johnsen fouled Bayern striker Carsten Jancker just outside the area, and Mario Basler placed a low free kick around the United wall to score the first goal. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> the free kick was not a deflection, but rather swerved into the far bottom corner of Peter Schmeichel's goal. Despite the bad start, United began to {{dominate}} possession but failed to create any clear cut chances despite David Beckham's tireless running. They seemed to be badly missing influential midfielders Paul Scholes and Roy Keane. The Bayern defence remained strong and well organised, as Andy Cole found out when his close-range effort was quickly closed down by three defenders. As Bayern began to look increasingly more dangerous on the counter-attack than their opponents did in possession, Jancker repeatedly tested the United back four {{with a number of}} clever runs, some of which were flagged offside.|$|E
40|$|First, {{concepts}} {{of different types}} of resampling will be introduced with simple examples. Next, [...] software applications for resampling are illustrated. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs,</b> many resampling tools are [...] available in standard statistical applications such as SAS and SyStat. Resampling can also be performed in [...] spreadsheet programs such as Excel. Last but not least, arguments for and against resampling are discussed [...] . I propose that there should be {{more than one way to}} construe probabilistic inferences and that counterfactual [...] reasoning is a viable means to justify use of resampling as an inferential tool...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} board overlap among firms listed in Switzerland. Collusion, {{managerial}} entrenchment, and financial participation cannot explain it. The overlap {{appears to be}} induced by banks and by the accumulation of seats by the most popular directors. We also document that seat accumulation is negatively related to firm value, possibly because of the conflicts of interest that multiple directorships induce and the time constraints directors face. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs,</b> however, the directors of traded firms do not generally hold more than one mandate in other traded firms. They do hold multiple seats in non-traded firms...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> some <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs</b> about [...] "man-hating butch dykes", lesbian {{feminist theory}} {{does not support}} the concept of female masculinity. Proponents like Sheila Jeffreys (2003:13) have argued that [...] "all forms of masculinity are problematic." ...|$|R
5|$|Development of Knuckles' Chaotix {{began in}} 1994 as an {{internal}} Sega engine test called Sonic Crackers for the Sega Genesis. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> this game (and ultimately Knuckles' Chaotix) were not developed by Sonic Team, but rather another internal development team at Sega. This team—which consisted of directors Masahide Kobayashi, Atsuhiko Nakamura, Naohisa Nakazawa, producers Hiroshi Aso, Makoto Oshitani, Mike Larsen, and artist Takumi Miyakewas—was assembled from young {{members of the}} staff who worked on Sonic CD (1993). Sonic Crackers featured Sonic and Tails joined together by a band of rings with an elastic nature. Although never released, the prototype's core tethering gameplay provided the foundation for Knuckles' Chaotix. The prototype ROM image has since leaked on the Internet and can be played {{with the use of}} emulators. Development was eventually transitioned to the 32X. Rather than featuring Sonic, the new game centered around a group of supporting characters led by Knuckles the Echidna, and the project was given the title Knuckles' Ringstar, later renamed Knuckles' Chaotix.|$|E
5|$|Hoepner's Panzer Corps and Prioux' Cavalry clashed head-on near Hannut, Belgium, on 12 May. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>belief,</b> the Germans did not outnumber the French. Frequently, {{figures of}} 623 German and 415 French tanks are given. The German 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions {{numbered}} 280 and 343 respectively. The 2e DLM and 3e DLM numbered 176 Somuas and 239 Hotchkiss H35s. Added to this force were the {{considerable number of}} Renault AMR-ZT-63s in the Cavalry Corps. The R35 was equal or superior to the Panzer I and Panzer IIs in armament terms. This applies all the more to the 90 Panhard 178 armoured cars of the French Army. Its 25mm main gun could penetrate the armour of the Panzer IV. In terms of tanks that were capable of engaging and surviving a tank-vs-tank action, the Germans possessed just 73 Panzer IIIs and 52 Panzer IVs. The French had 176 SOMUA and 239 Hotchkisses. German tank units also contained 486 Panzer I and IIs, which were of dubious combat value given their losses in the Polish Campaign.|$|E
5|$|The main {{antagonist}} of the story, Nitros Oxide, is {{the self-proclaimed}} fastest racer {{in the galaxy}} who threatens to turn Earth into a concrete parking lot. Preceding Oxide are four boss characters: Ripper Roo, a deranged straitjacket-wearing kangaroo; Papu Papu, the morbidly obese leader of the island's native tribe; Komodo Joe, a Komodo dragon with a speech sound disorder; and Pinstripe Potoroo, a greedy pinstripe-clad potoroo. The four boss characters, along with an imperfect and morally ambiguous clone of Crash Bandicoot named Fake Crash, become accessible as playable characters if the Adventure Mode is fully completed.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} intraday temporal {{relationships among}} arbitrage spreads, cash and futures price volatility, and cash trading volume, using transactions {{data for the}} Major Market Index futures contracts and the component stocks of the index. Results indicate that changes in the spread {{have a significant impact}} on cash and futures price volatility as well as on cash trading volume. The impact of the spread, however, is attenuated by the short-sale restriction in the cash market. <b>Contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs,</b> a more volatile market leads to subsequent decreases in the spread, probably because of increases in the supply of arbitrage services or faster price adjustments. © 1993...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} impact of design {{patterns}} on quality attributes {{in the context of}} software maintenance and evolution. We show that, <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs,</b> design patterns in practice impact negatively several quality attributes, thus providing concrete evidence against common lore. We then study design patterns and object-oriented best practices by formulating a second hypothesis on {{the impact of}} these principles on quality. We show that results for some design patterns cannot be explained and conclude on the need for further studies. Thus, we bring further evidence that design patterns should be used with caution during development because they may actually impede maintenance and evolution. 1...|$|R
