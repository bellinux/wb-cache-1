5000|$|Moringa stenopetala, {{commonly}} called the cabbage-tree (along {{with a number}} of other species), is a tree in the Moringa genus of flowering plants, native to Kenya and Ethiopia. [...] It is now extirpated in the wild in Ethiopia, though still grown there as a <b>crop</b> <b>on</b> the <b>terraces</b> built to conserve water high up the mountains. It is a multipurpose tree producing edible leaves, seeds used for the purification of water, and traditional medicinal products.|$|R
50|$|The bolo knife {{is common}} in the {{countryside}} due to its use as a farming implement. As such, it was used extensively during Spanish colonial rule as a manual alternative to ploughing with a carabao. Normally used for cutting coconuts, {{it was also a}} common harvesting tool for narrow row <b>crops</b> found <b>on</b> <b>terraces</b> such as rice, mungbeans, soybeans, and peanuts. Because of its availability, the bolo became a common choice of improvised weaponry to the everyday peasant.|$|R
60|$|In {{hopes of}} delaying them or {{inducing}} them to fight, the cavalry now trotted to within closer range, and dismounting, opened fire at 7.30 precisely. It was immediately returned. From high up the hillside, from the cornfields at the base, {{and from the}} towers of the villages, little puffs of smoke darted. The skirmish continued for an hour without much damage to either side, as the enemy were well covered by the broken ground and the soldiers by the gravestones and trees of a cemetery. Then the infantry began to arrive. The Buffs had been detached from Colonel Goldney's column and were moving against the village of Badelai. The 35th Sikhs proceeded towards the long ridge, round the corner of which Shahi-Tangi stands. As they crossed our front slowly--and rather wearily, for they were fatigued by the rapid marching--the cavalry mounted and rode off in quest of more congenial work with the cavalryman's weapon--the lance. I followed {{the fortunes of the}} Sikhs. Very little opposition was encountered. A few daring sharpshooters fired at the leading companies from the high corn. Others fired long-range shots from the mountains. Neither caused any loss. Colonel Goldney now ordered one and a half companies, under Captain Ryder, to clear the conical hill, and protect the right of the regiment from the fire--from the mountains. These men, about seventy-five in number, began climbing the steep slope; nor did I see them again till much later in the day. The remaining four and a half companies continued to advance. The line lay through high <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> <b>terraces,</b> rising one above the other. The troops toiled up these, clearing the enemy out of a few towers they tried to hold. Half a company was left with the dressing station near the cemetery, and two more were posted as supports {{at the bottom of the}} hills. The other two commenced the ascent of the long spur which leads to Shahi-Tangi.|$|R
5000|$|Ban Pa Pae {{is home to}} the Lua hilltribe, {{also known}} as Le Wuea and Lawa. It has 94 families. Traditionally, the people are rice farmers, {{cultivating}} one <b>crop</b> per year <b>on</b> <b>terraces</b> due to the mountainous terrain. In 1970, King Bhumibol and the queen visited Ban Pa Pae. The king encouraged the villagers to establish a rice bank to dampen the feast or famine cycle of rice availability. He gave 20,000 baht to cover start-up costs. To get started, the villagers bought 200,000 kg of rice with the funds. The rice bank now lends rice to villagers at 20 percent interest, payable in kind. The rice bank has now (2016) been operating for 46 years. Produce grown in the village is sold to the Mae Sariang Royal Project Development Centre. The king and queen visited the village five times between 1970 and 1981 to follow-up on progress. In 1979, a dirt road was cut to the village. It got electricity in 1996.|$|R
40|$|Minimal soil {{disturbance}} under {{conservation agriculture}} may limit {{the supply of}} immobile nutrients (such as phosphorus) to plant roots due to stratification of these nutrients close to the soil surface. Maize (Zea mays L.) roots usually do not proliferate {{into the middle of}} the rows until the plant has six to seven fully emerged leaves but a high P concentration in maize prior to the 6 -leaf stage will significantly increase final grain yield (Aldrich et al. 1986). Phosphorus availability is critical during the early stages of plant growth when the movement of P to plant roots (P absorption by the plant) is reduced with cold soil temperatures (Alley et al. 2009). This can occur during winter (rabi season) when most maize is grown in Bangladesh (Ali et al. 2009). Also P moves very little in soils, and thus, available soil P levels can be built with P fertilizer application appropriate for the tillage practice. The aim of present study was to determine the effects of tillage practices and P placement methods on soil physical, chemical and yield of maize <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> a Grey <b>Terrace</b> Soil in Bangladesh...|$|R
40|$|Soil water {{variations}} {{are due to}} topographic {{characteristics of}} soil and land uses on the sloppy lands. The objective {{of this study was}} to monitor the soil water variation in relation to three cropping patterns and three different terraces at Khairimurat area during 2007 - 08. Three cropping patterns were Wheat (Triticum asetivum L.) – Millet (Pennisetum glaucum) – Fallow, Wheat – Millet – Lentil (Lens caulinaris) and Wheat – Fallow and terraces were low height terrace (5 feet high from the leveled field), medium height terrace (3 feet high from the low terrace) and high height terrace (2. 5 feet high from medium terrace). Soil water measurements were performed monthly from above mentioned cropping patterns under different terraces and measured by adopting gravimetric method at six depths of the soil profile at an interval of 15 cm (0 - 15, 15 - 30, 30 - 45, 45 - 60, 60 - 75 and 75 - 90 cm). The soil water was available maximum on high height and low height terraces but it was observed minimum in medium terrace. Thus, the low delta <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> medium <b>terrace</b> should be planted instead of growing high delta crops. Actually, the medium terrace contains relatively low clay contents which resulted low retention of soil water. The soil water contents within all terraces down to the depth increased linearly. The rainfall distribution was almost same on the study site during the rainy season. However, the temperature variation trend at all the locations was season dependent. This study provides an idea for crop management under arid environment and to introduce the suitable crop in their cropping pattern. Hence, the high delta crop in the existing cropping patterns could be replaced by the new cropping patterns depending upon the findings of soil water availability...|$|R

50|$|Generally, ricebean {{is grown}} as an {{intercrop}} with maize, on rice bunds or <b>on</b> the <b>terrace</b> risers, as a sole <b>crop</b> <b>on</b> the uplands or as a mixed crop with maize in the khet (bunded parcels of lands where transplanted rice is grown) land. Under mixed cropping with maize {{it is usually}} broadcast some time between sowing maize and that crop’s first and second earthing up, so ricebean sowing extends from April-May to June.|$|R
