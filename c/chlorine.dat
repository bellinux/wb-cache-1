5|$|Bromine is {{the third}} halogen, being a nonmetal in group 17 of the {{periodic}} table. Its properties are thus {{similar to those of}} fluorine, <b>chlorine,</b> and iodine, and tend to be intermediate between those of the two neighbouring halogens, <b>chlorine</b> and iodine. Bromine has the electron configuration 3d104s24p5, with the seven electrons in the fourth and outermost shell acting as its valence electrons. Like all halogens, it is thus one electron short of a full octet, and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell. Corresponding to periodic trends, it is intermediate in electronegativity between <b>chlorine</b> and iodine (F: 3.98, Cl: 3.16, Br: 2.96, I: 2.66), and is less reactive than <b>chlorine</b> and more reactive than iodine. It is also a weaker oxidising agent than <b>chlorine,</b> but a stronger one than iodine. Conversely, the bromide ion is a weaker reducing agent than iodide, but a stronger one than chloride. These similarities led to <b>chlorine,</b> bromine, and iodine together being classified as one of the original triads of Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, whose work foreshadowed the periodic law for chemical elements. It is intermediate in atomic radius between <b>chlorine</b> and iodine, and this leads to many of its atomic properties being similarly intermediate in value between <b>chlorine</b> and iodine, such as first ionisation energy, electron affinity, enthalpy of dissociation of the X2 molecule (X = Cl, Br, I), ionic radius, and X–X bond length. The volatility of bromine accentuates its very penetrating, choking, and unpleasant odour.|$|E

5|$|<b>Chlorine</b> gas, {{also known}} as bertholite, was first used as a weapon in World War I by Germany on April 22, 1915 in the Second Battle of Ypres.

Human respiratory systems can be protected from <b>chlorine</b> gas by gas masks with activated charcoal or other filters, which makes <b>chlorine</b> gas much less lethal than other chemical weapons. It was pioneered by a German scientist later to be a Nobel laureate, Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, in collaboration with the German chemical conglomerate IG Farben, which developed methods for discharging <b>chlorine</b> gas against an entrenched enemy.

5|$|<b>Chlorine</b> is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between fluorine and bromine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. <b>Chlorine</b> is a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine but a stronger one than bromine or iodine.

However, this trend is not shown in the bond energies because fluorine is singular due to its small size, low polarisability, and lack of low-lying d-orbitals available for bonding (which <b>chlorine</b> has). As another difference, <b>chlorine</b> has a significant chemistry in positive oxidation states while fluorine does not.

40|$|Chlorinated benzenes {{have been}} {{extensively}} {{used in industry}} and agriculture and are common groundwater pollutants. Chlorobenzenes readily migrate to anaerobic zones in sediment and groundwater, thus understanding the fate of these compounds and anaerobic remediation are important goals. In previous studies in this laboratory, sediment microcosms were developed that reductively dehalogenated dichlorobenzene (DCB) isomers to monochlorobenzene (MCB) and MCB to benzene at high rates. Enrichment cultures that dehalogenated either 1, 2 -DCB, 1, 3 -DCB, or 1, 4 -DCB to MCB were derived from these microcosms, and Dehalobacter spp. were identified in an enrichment using 1, 2 -DCB. In this study, quantitative PCR (qPCR) of 16 S rRNA genes indicated Dehalobacter spp. were responsible for dehalogenation in all DCB cultures, and 16 S rRNA clone library analysis indicated 1, 2 - and 1, 4 -DCB dehalogenating Dehalobacter spp. were closely related while the Dehalobacter sp. in 1, 3 -DCB cultures was more divergent. In the course of purification of these cultures, methanogens and acetogens were eliminated, and culture conditions for growth of the dehalogenators were optimized. Extracts from a Sedimentibacter sp. isolated from a 1, 2 -DCB enrichment culture were added to 10 - 8 dilution cultures, allowing the isolation of 1, 2 -DCB and 1, 3 -DCB dehalogenating Dehalobacter sp. strains 12 DCB 1 and 13 DCB 1, although the extracts were not required for growth in subsequent transfers. Dehalobacter sp. strain 14 DCB 1 grew more slowly and was characterized in a highly enriched 1, 4 -DCB dehalogenating culture. Dehalogenation capabilities of each strain were tested with all chlorobenzene isomers, dichlorotoluenes, and tetrachloroethene (PCE), and each strain dehalogenated different combinations of these compounds. Strain 12 DCB 1 dehalogenated predominantly singly flanked <b>chlorines</b> on aromatic compounds and PCE, and did not dehalogenate compounds with only doubly flanked <b>chlorines</b> or those without any flanked <b>chlorines.</b> Strain 13 DCB 1 had the widest dehalogenation range of compounds tested, utilizing singly flanked <b>chlorines,</b> doubly flanked <b>chlorines,</b> meta substituted unflanked <b>chlorines,</b> and PCE, while strain 14 DCB 1 had the narrowest substrate range, dehalogenating para substituted <b>chlorines</b> and slowly dehalogenating some singly flanked <b>chlorines.</b> MCB dehalogenation to benzene was investigated in microcosms constructed with sediment from two different contaminated areas within the Chambers Works site. Attempts to transfer dehalogenation activity to sediment-free enrichment culture were not successful, though transfers into medium containing a commercial potting mix were achieved, which reduced the reliance upon limited supplies of sediment for perpetuation of MCB dehalogenation activity. A threshold below which MCB was not dehalogenated was investigated, and results suggested MCB was not utilized at concentrations below ca. 15 [MICRO SIGN]M in microcosms despite the thermodynamic favorability of the reaction. Lastly, qPCR confirmed Dehalobacter spp. {{played a role in}} MCB dehalogenation, and different Dehalobacter spp. were detected in 16 S rRNA clone libraries from the two sediment types which, together with DCB culture sequences, suggested 16 S rRNA gene sequence is not a good predictor of Dehalobacter spp. dehalogenation spectra. These studies have established a role for Dehalobacter spp. in the dehalogenation of chlorobenzenes, and this genus should be considered when determining the fate of diverse halogenated organic compounds...|$|R

5|$|<b>Chlorine</b> {{perchlorate}} (ClOClO3) is a {{pale yellow}} liquid {{that is less}} stable than ClO2 and decomposes at room temperature to form <b>chlorine,</b> oxygen, and dichlorine hexoxide (Cl2O6). <b>Chlorine</b> perchlorate may also be considered a <b>chlorine</b> derivative of perchloric acid (HOClO3), similar to the thermally unstable <b>chlorine</b> derivatives of other oxoacids: examples include <b>chlorine</b> nitrate (ClONO2, vigorously reactive and explosive), and <b>chlorine</b> fluorosulfate (ClOSO2F, more stable but still moisture-sensitive and highly reactive).

40|$|A {{microorganism}} whose {{growth is}} linked to the dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with doubly flanked <b>chlorines</b> was identified. Identification was made by reductive analysis of community 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences from a culture enriched in the presence of 2, 3, 4, 5 -tetrachlorobiphenyl (2, 3, 4, 5 -CB), which was dechlorinated at the para position. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of total 16 S rDNA extracted from the culture led to identification of three operational taxonomic units (OTUs 1, 2, and 3). OTU 1 was always detected when 2, 3, 4, 5 -CB or other congeners with doubly flanked <b>chlorines</b> were present and dechlorinated. Only OTUs 2 and 3 were detected in the absence of PCBs and when other PCBs (i. e., PCBs lacking doubly flanked <b>chlorines)</b> were not dechlorinated. Partial sequences of OTUs 2 and 3 exhibited 98. 2 % similarity to the sequence of “Desulfovibrio caledoniensis” (accession no. DCU 53465). A sulfate-reducing vibrio isolated from the culture generated OTUs 2 and 3. This organism could not dechlorinate 2, 3, 4, 5 -CB.

After 6 months, extensive meta dechlorination and moderate ortho dechlorination of Aroclor 1260 occurred in all incubated cultures except for sterilized controls.

5|$|Electronegativity is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself.

The dechlorination activity was maintained in serial cultures inoculated with transfers of 1 % inoculum when the transferred inoculum was treated each time in the same manner. No methane production was detected in any treated culture, although dechlorination of PCBs in the untreated cultures was always accompanied by methane production.
