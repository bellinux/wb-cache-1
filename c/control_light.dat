2500|$|At its launch, the Taurus was {{available}} in four models; the L, the MT-5, the GL, and the LX. The L was the base model, with only {{the most basic of}} equipment. The MT-5 was the second model, which was aimed at Japanese imports, as it was only available with a 4-cylinder engine and a five-speed manual transmission (hence the term MT-5). The value model was the GL, which contained more equipment than the MT-5 and L, and had such interior upgrades like rear headrests and a folding rear armrest, electric windows and locks. The LX was the top of the line model, which had the most standard equipment, as well as many features that were unique to this model, such as cornering lamps and side body cladding, as well as its own unique seat design, automatic climate <b>control,</b> <b>light</b> packages, luggage convenience kit, electronic cluster with onboard system scanner and fuel computer, autolamps with timer, premium amplified stereo with 6 speakers [...] "Premium Sound", 6 way electric seats with inflatable lumbar support and other equipment options at an added price.
