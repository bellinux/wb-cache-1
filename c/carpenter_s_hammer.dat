40|$|In 1929, the Austrian {{painter and}} type-set {{designer}} Victor Hammer (1882 - 1967) built his Opus 1 clavichord in Florence, Italy. This instrument is {{a copy of}} the ca. 1800 J. Lusser clavichord now in the German National Museum in Nuremberg. Hammer 2 ̆ 7 s clavichord is a milestone in many ways. It is an early copy of a rare survival of nineteenth-century Austrian clavichord building. Furthermore, it and Hammer 2 ̆ 7 s other surviving clavichord arguably represent the only instruments built in historical style between the cessation of Dolmetsch 2 ̆ 7 s work with the Gaveau firm in 1914 and the opening of the Skowroneck and Hubbard and Dowd shops in the 1950 <b>s.</b> <b>Hammer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s intention was to produce a number of such clavichords, a plan that, had it not been interrupted by WWII, would surely have changed the direction of the revival of the clavichord {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century. This lecture will compare Hammer 2 ̆ 7 s Opus 1 with the Lusser clavichord to establish how true Hammer stayed to his historical example, and will provide an assessment of the musical and historical importance of Lusser 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> and <b>Hammer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s work...|$|R

40|$|Early-nineteenth-century master house {{builders}} {{were not}} just craftsmen, they were surveyors, architects, financial managers, employers, and contractors. They typically went through an apprenticeship, but they also might have attended night school to hone their drafting and drawing skills. Journeyman work typically followed {{for at least a}} few years (paid either by the piece or by day, depending on the job and time of year), although a <b>carpenter</b> <b>s</b> first independent project could follow closely on the heels of an apprenticeship. The timing depended on the individual s own risk taking, as well as the ability to raise sufficient capital either to build speculatively or fulfill a custom home order. According to Donna Rilling, the route to craft autonomy lay in advance building of brick row houses (p. 67). ...|$|R
