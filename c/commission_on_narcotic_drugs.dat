5000|$|In 1998, {{ephedrine}} {{was recommended}} for control under the Convention. The Dietary Supplement Safety and Science Coalition lobbied against control, stressing the drug's history and safety, and arguing that [...] "ephedrine {{is not a}} controlled substance in the US today, nor should it be internationally". After a two-year debate, the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence decided against regulating ephedrine. However, the <b>Commission</b> <b>on</b> <b>Narcotics</b> <b>Drugs</b> and the International Narcotics Control Board listed the drug as a Table I precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in <b>Narcotic</b> <b>Drugs</b> and Psychotropic Substances, a move that did not require WHO approval.|$|R

2500|$|On May 13, 1986, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) {{issued a}} Final Rule and Statement of Policy authorizing the [...] "Rescheduling of Synthetic Dronabinol in Sesame Oil and Encapsulated in Soft Gelatin Capsules From Schedule I to Schedule II" [...] (DEA 51 FR 17476-78). This {{permitted}} medical use of Marinol, albeit with the severe restrictions associated with Schedule II status. For instance, refills of Marinol prescriptions were not permitted. At its 10th meeting, on April 29, 1991, the <b>Commission</b> <b>on</b> <b>Narcotic</b> <b>Drugs,</b> {{in accordance with}} article 2, paragraphs 5 and 6, of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, decided that Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (also referred to as Δ⁹-THC) and its stereochemical variants should be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II of that Convention. This released Marinol from the restrictions imposed by Article 7 of the Convention (See also United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances).|$|E
2500|$|While {{engaged in}} {{scheduling}} {{debates in the}} United States, the DEA also pushed for international scheduling. In 1985 the World Health Organization's Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended that MDMA be placed in Schedule I of the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The committee made this recommendation {{on the basis of}} the pharmacological similarity of MDMA to previously scheduled drugs, reports of illicit trafficking in Canada, drug seizures in the United States, and lack of well-defined therapeutic use. While intrigued by reports of psychotherapeutic uses for the drug, the committee viewed the studies as lacking appropriate methodological design and encouraged further research. Committee chairman Paul Grof dissented, believing [...] international control was not warranted at the time and a recommendation should await further therapeutic data. The <b>Commission</b> <b>on</b> <b>Narcotic</b> <b>Drugs</b> added MDMA to Schedule I of the convention on 11 February 1986.|$|E
2500|$|Jon Gettman, in Science and the End of Marijuana Prohibition, {{claims that}} [...] "if {{prohibition}} {{ends in the}} U.S. it must also end world-wide because U.S. law requires that we amend international drug control treaties to correspond with our own findings on scientific and medical issues". This is at least partially correct; 21 U.S.C. § 811(d)(2)(B) of the Controlled Substances Act states that if the United Nations <b>Commission</b> <b>on</b> <b>Narcotic</b> <b>Drugs</b> proposes rescheduling a drug, the HHS Secretary [...] "shall evaluate the proposal and furnish a recommendation to the Secretary of State which shall be binding on {{the representative of the}} United States in discussions and negotiations relating to the proposal". As the major financial contributor to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and related agencies, the U.S. {{has a great deal of}} influence over international drug policy. However, former United Nations Drug Control Programme Chief of Demand Reduction Cindy Fazey points out in The UN Drug Policies and the Prospect for Change that since cannabis restrictions are embedded in the text of the Single Convention, complete legalization would require denunciation of the Single Convention, amendment of the treaty, or a reinterpretation of its provisions that would likely be opposed by the International Narcotics Control Board.|$|E

40|$|Resumé International {{trafficking}} in drugs {{is one of}} the gravest global issues. Its combating deserves due attention. In {{the course of the last}} hundred years, a series of international conventions were adopted for this cause. The crucial international legal instruments for combating illicit drug trafficking are the Single Convention <b>on</b> <b>Narcotic</b> <b>Drugs</b> (1961), the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971) and foremost, the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in <b>Narcotic</b> <b>Drugs</b> and Psychotropic Substances (1988). The first two Conventions focus primarily on legal manipulation with narcotic and psychotropic substances via administrative measures. The goal is to limit them for medical and scientific use only and thus prevent their transfer into illegal channels. The third Convention deals with drug control via criminal law measures. The Parties to the Convention are to incriminate certain offences connected to drug trafficking and apply appropriate sanctions. The Convention also introduces measures against the transfer of proceedings of crime. It further deals with confiscation, extradition, jurisdiction issues and mutual legal assistance. The main bodies in the international fight against illegal trafficking are the UN <b>Commission</b> <b>on</b> <b>Narcotics,</b> International Narcotics Control Board and UN Office [...] ...|$|R
