Different cell types {{contribute}} to {{the differences in the}} nature of the <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>chain.</b> A high mannose-type oligosaccharide is observed in the proenzyme in fibroblasts, however the mature enzyme can be seen with a complex-type oligosaccharide. In the membranes of erythrocytes, the mature enzyme and the pro-enzyme both have a complex-type oligosaccharide. Auto catalytic cleavage produces two forms of the enzyme, with Form 1 beginning at residue Ile 54 and Form 2 at Thr 57.|$|E
50|$|In addition, ovotransferrin is glycosylated by the N-linkage to {{the amino}} acid known as asparagine, {{meaning that the}} glycan, the <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>chain,</b> is {{attached}} to the nitrogen on the amino acid. Asparagine, found abundantly in asparagus (hence, its name), is one of twenty of the most common amino acids and was the first amino acid to be isolated. While ovotransferrin identifies with its family, {{there are two types of}} Ovotransferrin proteins: apo and holo. Apo-Ovotransferrin is deprived of iron and holo-Ovotransferrin is saturated with iron. Because the apo-ovotransferrin is iron-deprived, it is easily destroyed by physical and chemical treatments.|$|E
50|$|Abrin {{works by}} {{penetrating}} {{the cells of}} the body and inhibiting cell protein synthesis. By attaching to a <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>chain</b> on the cell surface, the abrin molecule anchors itself to the cell, is subsequently engulfed and enters the inner parts of the cell where it reacts with a ribosomal subunit and interferes with the normal protein synthesis process of the cell. Without these proteins, cells cannot survive. This is harmful to the human body and can be fatal even in small exposures. The severity of the effects of abrin poisoning vary on the means of exposure to the substance (whether inhaled, ingested, or injected). Exposure to abrin on the skin can cause an allergic reaction, indicated by blisters, redness, irritation, and pain.|$|E

50|$|The {{erythropoietin}} receptor (EpoR) is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the EPOR gene. EpoR is a 52kDa peptide {{with a single}} <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>chain</b> resulting in a n approximately 56-57 kDa protein found {{on the surface of}} EPO responding cells. It {{is a member of the}} cytokine receptor family. EpoR pre-exists as dimers which upon binding of a 30 kDa ligand erythropoietin (Epo), changes its homodimerized state. These conformational changes result in the autophosphorylation of Jak2 kinases that are pre-associated with the receptor (i.e., EpoR does not possess intrinsic kinase activity and depends on Jak2 activity). At present, the most well-established function of EpoR is to promote proliferation and rescue of erythroid (red blood cell) progenitors from apoptosis.|$|E
50|$|Until today, {{little is}} known about the bioavailability, {{pharmacokinetics}} and metabolism of the glycoalkaloids in humans. An important factor is the poor uptake of tomatine into general blood circulation. When tomatine is orally ingested, much tomatine may form complexes with cholesterol from the other food present in the stomach. The complexes of tomatine and cholesterol are not absorbed in the intestine, but are excreted. For the complexation with cholesterol to occur, the presence of a <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>chain</b> is essential. The aglycon tomatidine, which is tomatine without the sugars, does not form the complexes. The complexation probably occurs in the duodenum, because the acidic conditions in the stomach itself lead to protonation of the tomatine, and the protonated form of tomatine does not bind to cholesterol.|$|E
50|$|Alpha-tomatine (α-tomatine) {{belongs to}} the {{compound}} group steroidal glycoalkaloids.

In α-tomatine, the tetrasaccharide called lycotetraose is attached to the O-3 of the steroidal aglycone. At first it was thought that the synthesis of steroidal alkaloids only involved multiple steps of hydroxylation, oxidation and amination of cholesterol with arginine as the source of the incorporated nitrogen. Later the glycoalkaloid metabolism genes were discovered. These genes produce the glycoalkaloid metabolism enzymes (GAME), which are responsible for the synthesis of steroidal alkaloid aglycones in potato and tomato plants.

Immunohistological studies indicated that blood group determinants appeared and disappeared in a certain order during ontogenetic development (7), that the H determinant was demonstrated to be a marker of cellular differentiation (8), and {{that the development of}} i to I antigen was shown to be associated with postnatal change of erythrocytes (9).

Fibrinopeptide A primarily released although the release of the fibrinopeptide B and Bβ 1 - 42 was significantly reduced.

Immunoblot analysis revealed that some sera contained antibodies to wild-type LPS which has a fully extended <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>chain</b> of immunotype L 3, 7, {{as well as to}} the homologous LPS. Sera reacted only weakly to LPS from 44 / 76 Mu- 3, which lacks the terminal glucose of the inner core. No binding to more truncated LPS was observed. Consequently, the cross-reactive epitopes are expressed mainly by the complete inner core. Dephosphorylation of wild-type LPS abolished antibody binding to LPS in all but one serum. Thus, at least two specificities of cross-reactive antibodies exist: one is dependent on phosphoethanolamine groups in LPS, and one is not. Detection of these cross-reactive antibodies strongly supports the notion that epitopes expressed by meningococcal LPS inner core are also accessible to antibodies when the <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>chain</b> is fully extended. Also, these inner core epitopes are sufficiently immunogenic to induce antibody levels detectable in polyclonal antibody responses.
