5|$|Yerkrapah was {{merged with}} the Republican Party of Armenia—a minor party with {{ideology}} {{similar to that of}} Yerkrapah—in summer 1998, taking the party's name and its legal status. Though Sargsyan was not the <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, he was considered its unofficial leader.|$|E
5|$|Goldwater {{selected}} William E. Miller, U.S. Representative and <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National Committee, as {{his running}} mate for the general election. Although virtually unknown to many voters, Miller was viewed by those familiar with him as a wise choice for the vice-presidential nomination, with his supporters arguing that he would {{play a key role in}} waging an aggressive campaign against Lyndon Johnson and the Democrats.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, Karl Rove ran for {{chair of}} the College Republicans. He {{challenged}} the front-runner's delegates, throwing the national convention into disarray, after which both he and his opponent, Robert Edgeworth, claimed victory. The dispute was resolved when Rove was selected through the direct order of the <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National Committee, {{who at the time}} was George H W Bush.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{wished to}} try again for {{elective}} office. Though a longtime admirer of Foraker (by then a U.S. senator), he had been careful to maintain {{good relations with the}} party faction led by the state's other U.S. senator, Mark Hanna, McKinley's political manager and <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National Committee (RNC). Both Foraker and Hanna supported Harding for state Senate in 1899; he gained the Republican nomination and was easily elected to a two-year term.|$|E
5|$|Taft upset some {{progressives}} {{by choosing}} Hitchcock as <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National Committee (RNC), placing him {{in charge of}} the presidential campaign. Hitchcock was quick to bring in men closely allied with big business. Taft took an August vacation in Hot Springs, Virginia, where he irritated political advisors by spending more time on golf than strategy. After seeing a newspaper photo of Taft taking a large swing at a golf ball, Roosevelt warned him against candid shots.|$|E

5|$|Harrison was unpopular {{with the}} party and the country, and many of Blaine’s old {{supporters}} encouraged him to run for the nomination. Blaine had denied any interest in the nomination months before his resignation, but some of his friends, including Senator Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania and James S. Clarkson, <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National Committee, took it for false modesty and worked for his nomination anyway. When Blaine resigned from the cabinet, his boosters were certain that he was a candidate, but the majority of the party stood by the incumbent. Harrison was renominated on the first ballot, but die-hard Blaine delegates still gave their champion 182 and 1/6 votes, good enough for second place.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Nixon's {{election}} as President in November 1968, he asked Chotiner what job he would like, and Chotiner {{indicated that he}} wanted to be <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National Committee (RNC), but was told that was impossible. However, Mitchell and soon-to-be White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman wished to see Chotiner given a position outside the White House, as they saw him as a rival. Accordingly, they proposed that Chotiner be made RNC executive director, to wield the real power with the chairman as figurehead. A reluctant Nixon, who was worried about Chotiner's hatchet-man reputation, finally agreed, and Chotiner wrapped up his affairs in California.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, Blaine {{ran for a}} seat in the Maine House of Representatives, and was elected. He ran {{for reelection}} in 1859, 1860, and 1861, and was {{successful}} each time by large majorities. The added responsibilities led Blaine to reduce his duties with the Advertiser in 1860, and he soon ceased editorial work altogether. Meanwhile, his political power was growing as he became <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> state committee in 1859, replacing Stevens. Blaine was not a delegate to the Republican convention in 1860, but attended anyway as an enthusiastic supporter of Abraham Lincoln. Returning to Maine, he was elected Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives in 1861 and reelected in 1862. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, he supported Lincoln’s war effort and saw that the Maine Legislature voted to organize and equip units to join the Union Army.|$|E
