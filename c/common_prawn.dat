40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of recorded boat noises on the behaviour and biochemistry of the <b>common</b> <b>prawn</b> (Palaemon serratus) in laboratory settings. The experiment was carried out in a tank equipped with a video-recording system using six groups (three control and three tested) of eight common prawns (48 animals in total). After habituation for 1 h, the behaviour of the prawns was monitored for 1 h. During the last 30 min, the animals in the test groups were exposed to noise resembling a marine area with high anthropogenic acoustic pollution. The exposure to noise produced significant changes in locomotor patterns, presence inside or outside a shelter, total protein concentrations in the haemolymph and brain, DNA integrity, and the expression protein levels of HSP 27 and 70 in brain tissues, revealing a stressful effect of noise on this crustacean species. This study clearly reveals that invertebrates are likely to be susceptible to acoustic stimuli from boat's noise and that they are potential valuable targets for further and detailed investigations into the effects of the anthropogenic noise pollution...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondria {{from the}} embryos of brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) do not undergo Ca 2 +-induced {{permeability}} transition {{in the presence}} of a profound Ca 2 + uptake capacity. Furthermore, this crustacean is the only organism known to exhibit bongkrekate-insensitive mitochondrial adenine nucleotide exchange, prompting the conjecture that refractoriness to bongkrekate and absence of Ca 2 +-induced permeability transition are somehow related phenomena. Here we report that mitochondria isolated from two other crustaceans, brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) and <b>common</b> <b>prawn</b> (Palaemon serratus) exhibited bongkrekate-sensitive mitochondrial adenine nucleotide transport, but lacked a Ca 2 +-induced permeability transition. Ca 2 + uptake capacity was robust in the absence of adenine nucleotides in both crustaceans, unaffected by either bongkrekate or cyclosporin A. Transmission electron microscopy images of Ca 2 +-loaded mitochondria showed needle-like formations of electron-dense material strikingly similar to those observed in mitochondria from the hepatopancreas of blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) and the embryos of Artemia franciscana. Alignment analysis of the partial coding sequences of the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) expressed in Crangon crangon and Palaemon serratus versus the complete sequence expressed in Artemia franciscana reappraised the possibility of the 208 - 214 amino acid region for conferring sensitivity to bongkrekate. However, our findings suggest that the ability to undergo Ca 2 +-induced mitochondrial permeability transition and the sensitivity of adenine nucleotide translocase to bongkrekate are not necessarily relate...|$|E

40|$|Freshwater {{shrimp in}} Oklahoma have {{received}} little attention. Most studies {{have concentrated on}} the genus Macrobrachium, a brackish and freshwater river shrimp which can be cultured for commercial consumption (1). Members of the other genus, Palaemonetes (prawns), are poorly known because of their limited commercial value and overall similarity. Meehan (2) and Strenth (3) have discussed the biology of this genus. The purpose of this report is to describe the abundance and distribution of Palaemonetes in Oklahoma. Palaemonetes is divided into several species. Palaemonetes paludosus (P. exilipes) has been recorded from Oklahoma (4). The species found {{in the present study}} is Palaemonetes kadiakensis, a <b>common</b> <b>prawn</b> found in the central and southern U. S. (5). Specimens were collected by Mr. Jim Pigg and associates in the summer of 1982. The animals were preserved in alcohol and sent to me for identification. Animals were identified to species by using available keys. They were sexed and measured to the nearest millimeter. Mean size was determined for juveniles, males, females, gravid females, and all animals per collection site, as well as for all collection sites combined. Animals were collected in south-central, southeastern, eastern, and southern Oklahoma (Table 1). Table 2 shows the size range, sex ratio and mean size for all specimens at all collection sites.

40|$|Animals can use {{socially}} {{transmitted information}} {{to learn about}} the distribution and quality of resources without incurring the costs associated with having to search for and sample them first hand. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} the use of chemical social information specific to patterns of diet and habitat use is an important mechanism underpinning recognition and social organization in shoaling fishes. In this study we revealed that the use of resource-specific chemical information is not limited to conspecifics, or even members of the same taxon. In a series of laboratory experiments, we showed that threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) could recognize similar patterns of habitat use in <b>common</b> <b>prawns</b> (Leander serratus), preferentially orientating towards groups of prawns exposed to the same habitats as themselves, and even selecting foraging patches located close to them. Prawns were seen to use habitat-specific cues generated by conspecifics, but not by sticklebacks, suggesting that the benefits of forming these heterospecific social association patterns may be unequal for prawns and fishes. Our findings suggest that some species might use co-occurring, unrelated species as information centres in order to orient and locate resources within their surroundings...|$|R

25|$|Bluespotted {{trevally}} are predatory fish, consuming a {{range of}} crustaceans and fish. Studies in the Gulf of Carpentaria and in particular, Albatross Bay, indicate the species is most <b>common</b> over known <b>prawn</b> grounds. A shift in diet happens with age, with young fish less than 275mm in length taking penaeids, brachyurans, other crustaceans, echinoderms, and molluscs, while larger fish take mostly small fish. The smaller trevally tend to forage during the day, taking species of small noncommercial species of prawns, while the larger fish took larger, commercially important species at night. Experimental studies indicate the species has low success foraging in seagrass beds and over soft strata where penaeids burrow during the day, but increased efficiency during the night when the prawns emerge to forage. There appears to be little seasonal variation in diet.|$|R
40|$|From the {{beginning}} of this century, large varieties of prawns belonging to families Penaeidae, Pasiphaeidae, Oplophoridae and Pandalidae have been reported from the west coast of India, particularly from southern regions beyond the continental shelf (Alcock 1901, 1906; de Man 1911, 1920; Calman 1939; John and Kurian 1959; Kurian 1964; George 1966; George and Rao 1966 b; Suseelan and Mohamed 1968 and Suseelan 1974, 1989).

40|$|Macrobrachium australiense is a <b>common</b> {{freshwater}} <b>prawn</b> {{found throughout}} most of eastern and inland Australia. Debate has been ongoing on the systematics of this species due to high morphological variation: past studies have relied on external morphology assessments to describe genetic relationships between populations. An individual's morphological phenotype results however, from an interplay of genetic factors, environmental, and interactions between genes and the environment. The current study examined the strength of genetic constraint on morphological traits in this species. Examination of over 1000 M. australiense museum specimens collected from across the species' extensive natural range, documented high phenotypic variation with no regional pattern of variation. Within regions, 88 % of variation in morphological traits in mature males and juveniles was present between local rivers. Therefore, morphological variation is not structured at the regional level. If {{there is a strong}} genetic base to morphological variation then populations in a single river system must be evolving essentially in isolation. More intensive sampling within a single river system demonstrated high morphological variation in 600 M. australiense individuals from 18 populations within a geographically connected system. Populations separated by as little as 1 km showed significant morphological differences in 50 % of mature male traits. If morphological variation is primarily genetically based, then populations within a river system were evolving independently at a very fine spatial scale. This hypothesis was tested by breeding morphologically divergent populations of M. australiense in a controlled environment to isolate genetic influences on morphological variation. Low heritability for morphological traits in five divergent populations raised under identical environments established that there is no strict genetic control on morphological variation in these M. australiense populations. Morphologically homogenous offspring resulted from wild parents that had exhibited significant differences at 73 % of traits examined. Therefore, the fundamental assumption that morphological variation in M. australiense is dictated by strict genetic control is not supported in these representative populations. Moreover, significant variation in 41 % of morphological traits was produced by raising a single population at different environmental temperatures (28 oC and 22 oC). A single homogenous stock of M. australiense should not produce morphologically divergent offspring if genetic factors are the major influence of phenotypic expression. Crossing of pure line divergent stocks resulted in hybrid offspring with significant differences in 50 % of female morphological traits, whereas male offspring varied for only 31 % of morphological traits. This result suggests that female morphological expression is affected more strongly by genetic factors than male offspring in this trial. The growth and maturation of external morphological traits during development in M. australiense is under limited genetic constraint, especially in the later phases of growth. Only 17 % of traits varied between juvenile stocks {{in the last three months}} of development when individuals were exposed to identical environmental conditions. Maturation size was homogenous, except for females in the absence of maturing males in divergent stocks exposed to identical environmental conditions. Females were much larger in size and shape of morphological traits in the absence of mature males in the population. Thus environmental factors strongly influence phenotypic expression of external morphology in M. australiense. Past problems with the taxonomy of this species are therefore understandable as many important traits used in systematics appear to be under limited genetic control. Past evolutionary studies based on morphological diversity in this species therefore may be unreliable as the traits used to identify divergent forms may not provide a true reflection of genetic divergence...|$|R
40|$|Estuarine ecology in South Africa {{has progressed}} in two {{distinct}} stages. The {{first of these}} was a necessary descriptive phase which documented the general distribution of estuarine animals and recorded the physical conditions within estuaries. This phase {{has been carried out}} by the Zoology Department of the University of Cape Town which has made a series of ecological surveys of southern African estuaries. These surveys have provided a vast amount of valuable information which was utilised by Day (1964.) to state some general conclusions about estuarine faunas. The most important of these conclusions {{is that most of the}} estuarine fauna is really a quiet water fauna which also occurs in sheltered non-estuarine water. The information gained in this first stage is necessarily general and it can only indicate overall trends or reveal major features of distribution. Further estuary surveys are not justified unless they deal with unique conditions. It is at this point that the second phase of estuarine ecology becomes necessary. This phase involves a detailed investigation of individual species or particular problems. The present investigation falls into this second stage of estuarine ecology and was designed to extend our knowledge of the anomuran mud prawn Upogebia africana (Ortmann). The general estuarine surveys have shown that U. africana is a common inhabitant of many estuaries and sheltered bays along the southern African coast from Langebaan on the West coast to Inhambane on the East coast. However these surveys only revealed and could not explain anomalies in its distribution such as its apparent absence from closed estuaries and from estuaries in the tropics. In addition it was not even certain whether this abundant and widespread animal should really be considered a valid species distinct from a <b>common</b> West Coast <b>prawn</b> Upogebia capensis (Krauss). It was felt that a study of an estuarine species should be based upon a sound knowledge of its distribution, population structure and habitat. Knowledge of the habitat must be gained by studies in the field to establish which facets of the environment are of importance to the species. It was decided on the basis of field observations that temperature and salinity are of prime importance: in limiting the distribution of U. africana and a detailed laboratory study was therefore made of the tolerance of U. africana to these two physical factors. The results of laboratory experiments together with field observations were finally used to interpret the ecology of the species. Most of present day knowledge of crustacean ecology has been gained from a study of European and North American animals and information about southern hemisphere species has lagged behind. It is hoped that the present study will contribute to a wider understanding of Crustacea and that it will lead to further more advanced research on South African marine and estuarine animal...|$|R
