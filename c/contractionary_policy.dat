Policy makers are viewed as interacting as strategic substitutes when one policy maker's expansionary (contractionary) policies are countered by another policy maker's contractionary (expansionary) policies. For example: if the fiscal authority raises taxes or cuts spending, then the monetary authority reacts to it by lowering the policy rates and vice versa. If they behave as strategic complements, then an expansionary (<b>contractionary)</b> <b>policy</b> of one authority is met by expansionary (contractionary) policies of the other.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence on}} the relationship between cyclical shocks and productivity growth, for 20 2 -digit SIC US manufacturing industries and a set of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and oil price shocks. The paper uses as a measure of productivity change a Solow residual corrected {{for a wide range of}} non-technological effects due to imperfect-competition, non-constant returns to scale, and cyclical utilization rates of capital and labor services. The empirical framework identifies policy shocks independently of productivity measurement issues via a two-step procedure. While the typical industry shows weak responses of productivity to the shocks considered, in some industries temporary <b>contractionary</b> <b>policy</b> shocks lead to increases in productivity. In addition, the results reveal that there are localized asymmetries, with <b>contractionary</b> <b>policy</b> shocks having larger productivity effects than their expansionary counterparts. The results support the thesis that job reallocation is an important channel linking <b>contractionary</b> <b>policy</b> shocks and productivity growth.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{view is that}} {{a monetary}} policy shock has both supply-side and demand-side effects, {{at least in the}} short run. Barth and Ramey (2001) show that the supply-side effect of a monetary policy shock may be greater than the demand-side effect. We argue that it is crucial for monetary authorities to understand whether an increase in expected future inflation is due to supply shocks or demand shocks before applying <b>contractionary</b> <b>policy</b> to forestall inflation. Using a standard New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with the cost-channel of monetary transmission, we show that whether the South African Reserve Bank should apply <b>contractionary</b> <b>policy</b> to fight inflation depends critically on the nature of the disturbance. If an increase in expected future inflation is mainly due to supply shocks, the South African Reserve Bank should not apply <b>contractionary</b> <b>policy</b> to fight inflation, as this would lead to a persistent increase in inflation and a greater loss in output.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{estimated}} the monetary reaction {{function of the}} Central Bank of Republic of Turkey. The originality of the paper {{is that we have}} used smooth transition functions (STR) that allow for proper modelling of nonlinearities and asymmetries in the relationship between variables under consideration. The estimated models suggest that the backward-looking instead of foreward-looking models best characterise the CBRT’s reaction function, that is, the CBRT reacted to past inflation rates rather than to future rates. This finding is in conformity with earlier research. We have found that the main purpose of expansionary policy of the CBRT is to stabilise output whereas contractionary policies aimed only at reducing the inflation rate. The fact that the CBRT has disregarded inflation in conducting expansionary policy and focused only on output stabilisation may explain why the CBRT was not successful in fighting inflation. Besides, neither in expansionary policy regime nor in <b>contractionary</b> <b>policy</b> regime, real exchange rate is not targeted by CBRT. Moreover, budget deficit is targeted only in the <b>contractionary</b> <b>policy</b> regime. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. I {{identify}} a forward-looking monetary policy {{function in a}} structural VAR model by using forecasts of macroeconomic variables, {{in addition to the}} realized variables used in a standard VAR. Both impulse responses and variance decompositions of the monetary pol-icy variable of this forecast-augmented VAR model suggest that forecasted variables play a greater role than realized variables in a central bank’s policy decisions. I also find that a <b>contractionary</b> <b>policy</b> shock instantaneously increases the market interest rate as well as the forecast of the market interest rate. The policy shock also appreciates both the British pound and the forecast of the pound on impact. On the other hand, the policy shock lowers expected inflation immediately, but affects realized inflation with a lag. When I estimate the standard VAR model encompassed in the forecast-augmented model, I find that a <b>contractionary</b> <b>policy</b> shock raises the inflation rate and leads to a gradual appreciation of the domestic currency. However, the inclusion of inflation expectations reverses this puzzling response of the infla-tion rate, and the inclusion of both the market interest rate forecast and the exchange rate forecast removes the delayed overshooting response of the exchange rate. These findings suggest that a standard VAR may incorrectly identify the monetary policy function...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} applies vector autoregression {{approaches to}} assess {{the effects of the}} monetary policy in South Africa. First, the dissertation quantified declines in the consumption expenditure attributed to the combined house wealth and credit effects due to the <b>contractionary</b> monetary <b>policy</b> shocks. The results at the peak of interest rates effects on consumption on the sixth quarter provide little support that the indirect house wealth channel is the dominant source of monetary policy transmission to consumption. Second, the dissertation assessed how real interest rate reacts to positive inflation rate shocks, exchange rate depreciation shocks and the existence of Fisher effect over longer periods. Evidence confirmed the Fisher effect holds over longer horizons and the real interest rate reacts negatively to the inflation and exchange rate shocks. In addition, findings show that the strict inflation-targeting approach is not compatible with significant real output growth. The results show that only the real effective exchange rate is growth enhancing under flexible inflation targeting approach. Third, the dissertation investigated and compared the effects of <b>contractionary</b> monetary <b>policy</b> and exchangerate appreciation shocks on trade balance in South Africa. Evidence suggests that the exchange rate appreciation shocks worsen the trade balance for longer periods than <b>contractionary</b> monetary <b>policy</b> shocks in South Africa. In addition, the findings indicate that monetary policy operates through the expenditure switching channel rather than the income channel in the short run to lower net trade balance. Finally, the dissertation investigated the effect of <b>contractionary</b> monetary <b>policy</b> shocks on output in South Africa and Korea. The chapter compared what the estimated structural shocks suggested about policy shocks relative to bank systematic responses. Evidence shows that a <b>contractionary</b> monetary <b>policy</b> shock reduces output persistently in South Africa compared to transitory declines in Korea. The estimated monetary policy shocks suggest that Korean monetary policy was expansionary during the recession in 2009 unlike the South Africa counterparty. I attribute the differences to monetary policy intervention tools such as swap arrangement, in addition to interest rate reductions used to deal with recession in Korea...|$|R
