5|$|Battlefield Germany is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Personal Software Services for the Commodore 64 released in April 1987. It was also ported to the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum later that year. It is the eighth instalment to the Strategic Wargames series. The game is set during a fictional scenario in which the powers of NATO and the Warsaw Pact engage in a conventional war throughout Europe, mostly <b>centring</b> in West and East Germany.|$|E
5|$|Lapierre {{is known}} {{primarily}} as a checking forward, <b>centring</b> either {{the third or fourth}} line. He has a reputation as an agitator, distracting and provoking opposing players to take penalties. He plays with an aggressive edge and led all Canadiens forward in hits in his last full season with the club. Defensively responsible, he earns time on the penalty kill. In 2008–09, he ranked third on the Canadiens in average short handed time on ice per game.|$|E
5|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, creatures known as Sarnathians ruled the Earth, <b>centring</b> their values on torture of other creatures that {{were opposed to}} their rule. Their aim was to rule the {{universe}} using a mysterious orb that granted them great power. Thousands of years later, the orb became too powerful and eventually caused a tear in the inter-dimensional fabric of the Realm of Reality and the Realm of Unreality, thus rendering the Sarnathians extinct.|$|E

5|$|Much of Keable's fiction {{contained}} autobiographical elements, often <b>centring</b> on his {{attitudes toward}} {{and experience of}} the Christian religious establishment. As well as these fictional explorations he produced a final, non-fiction work, The Great Galilean, outlining the religious views he developed during a lifetime's uneasy relationship to Anglicanism and Catholicism. He {{came to believe that}} the historical Jesus bore little relationship to the Jesus of Christian tradition, and, in The Great Galilean, attempted to reconcile his ambivalence about the orthodoxies of the Church with his enduring belief in an all-loving God. Keable's views earned him many unfavourable reviews and the contempt of the church in which he had practised, but foreshadowed ideas of free love that became prominent later in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Economic growth {{began to}} falter {{at the end}} of the 13th century, owing to a {{combination}} of overpopulation, land shortages and depleted soils. The Great Famine shook the English economy severely and population growth ceased; the first outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 then killed around half the English population. The agricultural sector shrank rapidly, with higher wages, lower prices and diminishing profits leading to the final demise of the old demesne system and the advent of the modern farming system <b>centring</b> on the charging of cash rents for lands. As returns on land fell, many estates, and in some cases entire settlements, were simply abandoned, and nearly 1,500 villages were deserted during this period. A new class of gentry emerged who rented farms from the major nobility. Unsuccessful government attempts were made to regulate wages and consumption, but these largely collapsed in the decades following the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.|$|E

5|$|Other {{important}} {{days were}} commemorated at memorials around the world. Australia commemorated Armistice Day, but held larger scale commemorations around Anzac Day on 25 April. Anzac Day was founded {{to remember the}} Gallipoli campaign, and memorials were erected for the first ceremonies in 1916; dawn services at local memorials formed {{a key part of}} the national event. In France, the authorities in Verdun organised the Fêtes de la Victoire on 23 June, <b>centring</b> on the city's memorials and the nearby ossuary. These usually involved senior French military figures and pageantry. Ceremonies to honour the fallen of the battle of the Somme were held by the British at the Somme memorials on the Sunday nearest 1 July throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Romania – inter-war years, the Feast of the Ascension used to commemorate the war dead. Termed Heroes' Day, civic processions under central guidance from the Societata took place to the local war memorials. The 6 August was also used to commemorate the battle of Mărăşeşti at the site. Many of these adopted the British use of collective silence during the memorial ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game's release, an {{official}} prelude story {{was published by}} way of a multimedia web site. The interactive site was depicted as the diary of Antoine Cartier-Wells, founder of the Memorize corporation and creator of the Sensen brain implant, and it tells the story of Memorize during the 100 years preceding the start of the game. At the time of the game's release, a 24-page print comic book written by Matt Kindt and illustrated by Matthew Southworth was released by Dark Horse Comics, as an exclusive bonus item for those who pre-ordered the game from GameStop. Dark Horse later published a 184-page hardcover book featuring concept art and developer commentary. On 20 June 2013, another official prelude story was published, this time set months {{before the start of the}} game, and <b>centring</b> on the character of Nilin. Titled The Pandora Archive, it was written by British novelist Scott Harrison and published by Capcom as an e-book.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} purely {{documentary evidence}} for motte-and-bailey castles in Normandy and Angers comes from between 1020 and 1040, but {{a combination of}} documentary and archaeological evidence pushes the date for the first motte and bailey castle, at Vincy, back to 979. The castles were built by the more powerful lords of Anjou in the late 10th and 11th centuries, in particular Fulk III and his son, Geoffrey II, who built {{a great number of}} them between 987 and 1060. Many of these earliest castles would have appeared quite crude and rustic by later standards, belying the power and prestige of their builders. William the Conqueror, as the Duke of Normandy, is believed to have adopted the motte-and-bailey design from neighbouring Anjou. Duke William went on to prohibit the building of castles without his consent through the Consuetudines et Justicie, with his legal definition of castles <b>centring</b> on the classic motte-and-bailey features of ditching, banking and palisading.|$|E

5|$|Becoming an {{unrestricted}} free {{agent for the}} third consecutive year in July 2010, Morrison did not initially receive any offers. As a result, he accepted a tryout with the Vancouver Canucks and attended the team's training camp in Penticton, British Columbia. At the conclusion of the pre-season, the Canucks offered Morrison a two-way contract, which he turned down. The following day, on October 4, 2010, Morrison was signed by the Calgary Flames to a one-year, one-way contract worth US$725,000. The Flames had signed Morrison in lieu of numerous injuries at the centre position on their roster. He scored his first goal as a Flame on October 16 in a 5–3 win against the Edmonton Oilers. After recording 43 points in 66 games, Morrison suffered a season-ending injury in March 2011. He hurt his left knee in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks when opposing defenceman Niklas Hjalmarsson pinned him against the end-boards. At the time of the injury, Morrison was leading the Flames with a plus-minus rating of +13 while <b>centring</b> the team's top line with Jarome Iginla and Alex Tanguay. On July 15, 2011, Morrison came to terms with the Flames on a one-year deal worth US$1.25 million.|$|E
5|$|Canucks Head Coach Alain Vigneault had {{reportedly}} recommended Lapierre to General Manager Mike Gillis, having coached Lapierre in the QMJHL. Upon {{his arrival}} in Vancouver, Lapierre's reputation as an agitator was addressed by Vigneault and {{he was asked to}} reduce activity in between whistles, such as trash talking and unnecessary hits. Lapierre scored his first goal as a Canuck on March 16, 2011, in a 4–2 win against the Colorado Avalanche. While the Canucks originally acquired Lapierre with the intention of playing him on the fourth line, he soon moved up to the third with the injury of Manny Malhotra late in the season. Between Montreal, Anaheim and Vancouver, he finished the season with six goals and six assists over 78 games. <b>Centring</b> the third line with wingers Raffi Torres and Jannik Hansen during the 2011 playoffs, Lapierre added three goals and five points over 25 games. He helped Vancouver reach the Stanley Cup Finals {{for the first time in}} 17 years. During the Finals, Lapierre scored the only goal of Game 5 against the Boston Bruins, helping Vancouver to a 1–0 win. With a 3–2 lead in the series, the Canucks went on to lose the next two contests, losing the Stanley Cup in seven games. Set to become an restricted free agent in the off-season, Lapierre was re-signed by Vancouver to a two-year, $2 million contract on June 27, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Hodgson {{made his}} NHL debut on February 1, 2011, in a 4–1 win against the Dallas Stars. <b>Centring</b> the fourth line and {{playing on the}} second powerplay unit, he {{registered}} two shots in over nine minutes of ice time. The following day, he scored his first career NHL goal against Ilya Bryzgalov in a 6–0 win against the Phoenix Coyotes. In his third game, he recorded his first career NHL assist on a goal by Christian Ehrhoff against the Chicago Blackhawks; Vancouver won 4–3. After appearing in his first five NHL games, Hodgson was returned to the Moose on February 11. Team management explained to the media his call-up was a means to introduce him to NHL play {{and that they were}} more comfortable having him continue developing in the AHL with first-line minutes and a bigger role with the Moose. However, with the team's fourth-line centre role unfilled (Alain Vigneault had been using natural winger Tanner Glass in that position), he was called back to Vancouver within ten days. Hodgson played three more games for the Canucks before the team acquired fourth-line centre Maxim Lapierre from the Anaheim Ducks at the trade deadline on February 28. Hodgson was subsequently sent back down to Manitoba. He completed his professional rookie season with 30 points in 52 AHL games – ranking fifth in Moose scoring – and two points in eight NHL games.|$|E

5|$|One {{result of}} the {{economic}} and political tensions was the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, in which widespread rural discontent was followed by an invasion of London involving thousands of rebels. The rebels had many demands, including the effective end of the feudal institution of serfdom and a cap on the levels of rural rents. The ensuing violence took the political classes by surprise and the revolt was not fully put down until the autumn; up to 7,000 rebels were executed in the aftermath. As a {{result of the}} revolt, parliament retreated from the poll tax and instead focused on a system of indirect taxes <b>centring</b> on foreign trade, drawing 80% of tax revenues from the exports of wool. Parliament continued to collect direct tax levies at historically high levels up until 1422, although they reduced them in later years. As a result, successive monarchs found that their tax revenues were uncertain, and HenryVI enjoyed less than half the annual tax revenue of the late 14th century. England's monarchs became increasingly dependent on borrowing and forced loans to meet the gap between taxes and expenditure and even then faced later rebellions over levels of taxation, including the Yorkshire rebellion of 1489 and the Cornish rebellion of 1497 during the reign of HenryVII.|$|E
