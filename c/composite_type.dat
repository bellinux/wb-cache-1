40|$|In this research, fiber {{reinforcement}} cement composites (A and B) {{with low}} thermal conductivity were produced. <b>Composites</b> <b>type</b> B were produced by {{two levels of}} fibers (Equisetum telmateia), 15 and 25 %, three levels of silica fume gel, 0, 7 and 10 % and three levels of fly ash, 0, 20 and 30 %. In <b>composites</b> <b>type</b> A fly ash was replaced by aluminium powder in three levels, 0, 0. 08 and 0. 1 % (all percentage by weight) to manufacture composites with target density and thickness of 1. 10 g/cm 3 and 13 mm respectively.

40|$|Abstract. An {{extension}} to ER (Entity Relationship) model for semantic modeling of databases in top down manner is presented. The model proposes a new entity <b>type</b> called <b>composite</b> entity <b>type</b> and a table based meta construct called tabletype relationship. A <b>composite</b> entity <b>type</b> models <b>composite</b> entities, whereas a tabletype relationship is shorthand and represents {{a number of}} relationship types. The concept of <b>composite</b> entity <b>type</b> is abstract, helps in semantic modeling, and is not required in implementation. A <b>composite</b> entity <b>type</b> along with tabletype relationship captures semantics of the database of an application {{at a higher level}} of abstraction and provides a top down semantic modeling approach in flavor of ER model...|$|R

5000|$|In {{database}} design, {{object-oriented programming}} and design (see object oriented program architecture), has-a (has_a or has a) is a composition relationship where one object (often called the constituted object, or part/constituent/member object) [...] "belongs to" [...] (is part or member of) another object (called the <b>composite</b> <b>type),</b> and behaves {{according to the}} rules of ownership. In simple words, has-a relationship in an object is called a member field of an object. Multiple has-a relationships will combine to form a possessive hierarchy.|$|E
50|$|In {{programming}} languages, composite {{objects are}} usually expressed {{by means of}} references from one object to another; depending on the language, such references may be known as attributes, fields, members or properties, and the resulting composition as <b>composite</b> <b>type,</b> storage record, structure, tuple, or a user-defined type (UDT). Fields are given a unique name so that each one can be distinguished from the others. However, having such references doesn't necessarily mean that an object is a composite. It is only called composite, if the objects it refers to are really its parts, i.e. have no independent existence. For details, see the aggregation section below.|$|E
