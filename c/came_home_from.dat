According to Stella, Nickell took four Extra-Strength Excedrin {{capsules}} from a bottle in their home for his headache and collapsed minutes later. Nickell died shortly thereafter at Harborview Medical Center, where treatment had failed to revive him.

5|$|Hashimoto ordered I-58 northward {{looking for}} {{additional}} ships to attack. She picked up {{reports of the}} atomic bombing of Hiroshima in intercepted radio transmissions on 7 August but Hashimoto continued to hunt for Allied ships south of Bungo Strait. On 9 August she launched two kaitens against a convoy, and Hashimoto claimed a destroyer probably sunk. On 12 August he launched his remaining kaitens and claimed a merchant ship probably sunk. I-58 surfaced in Bungo Strait on 15 August, where Hashimoto learned of the Gyokuon-hōsō signaling the Japanese surrender {{and end of the}} war. She traveled up the Inland Sea and arrived at Hirao where Hashimoto emotionally informed his crew {{of the end of the}} war. After the war, it was confirmed Indianapolis was the only ship I-58 had sunk. It was the last Japanese naval success of World War II. When Hashimoto <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the war, he learned that his entire family had been killed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on 7 August.|$|E

Lewis began his career in insurance with Sedgwick and Collins, brokers with Lloyd's of London. During 1919 and 1920, despite his resignation from flying, Lewis began writing about aviation safety while he began his career as an insurance broker. He also wrote Wings Over the Somme 1916–1918, his memoir of his war experiences. At some point during this time, Lewis also served as the Recorder of Chesterfield.|$|E
25|$|Five {{days after}} the wedding, Jim {{received}} his draft notice. He was sent to France and became part of a military touring group that entertained the armed forces after World War I. When Jim <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> France, he and Marian decided to try their luck with a vaudeville act. They had two children, Kathryn Therese Jordan (1920–2007) and James Carroll Jordan (1923–1998), both born in Peoria. Marian returned home {{for the birth of}} Kathryn but went back to performing with Jim, leaving her daughter with Jim's parents. After Jim Jr. was born in 1923, Marian stayed with the children for a time, while Jim performed as a solo act. Marian and the children joined him on the road for a short time, but the couple had to admit defeat when they found themselves in Lincoln, Illinois in 1923 with two small children and no funds. The couple's parents had to wire them money for their return to Peoria. Jim went to work at a local department store but still felt the attraction of being in show business. He and Marian went back into vaudeville.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1915, Parnok and Tsvetaeva, both of their sisters, and Osip Mandelstam were guests at Maximilian Voloshin's dacha in Koktebel. Parnok did not care for Mandelstam though Tsvetaeva was openly {{friendly}} and would later have an affair with him. By July, the lovers left Koktebel, just before Tsvetaeva's husband's arrived, spending a month on holiday in Sviatye Gory. In January 1916, Tsvetaeva and Mandelstam met at a literary salon in Saint Petersburg, possibly by chance, and recognized each other's talents. The meeting caused a heated quarrel with Parnok. The following month, Mandelstam's attempt to continue the discussion with Tsvetaeva, which had begun in Saint Petersburg, {{proved to be the}} final straw in breaking up she and Parnok's relationship. Tsvetaeva <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> taking Mandelstam to see the sites of Moscow to find Parnok entertaining the actress Lyudmila Vladimirovna Erarskaya. It is unknown exactly when Parnok and Erarskaya met, but theirs would be the longest relationship of the poet's life, lasting for the next sixteen years. In a pique, Tsvetaeva asked Parnok to return her Podruga and her manuscripts. Parnok was outraged, not only that she wanted her gift returned, but that she was trying to conceal the origin of the poems in their affair.|$|E

Cho was noted for being good at mathematics and English, and teachers pointed to him as an example for other students. At that time, according to Kim, nobody disliked Cho and he [...] "was recognized by friends as a boy of knowledge;... a good dresser who was popular with the girls." [...] Kim added that [...] "I only have good memories about him."

500|$|On August 27, 1964, Kemper's grandmother, Maude Matilda Hughey Kemper (1897–1964), {{was sitting}} at the kitchen table when she and Kemper had an argument. Enraged by the argument, Kemper stormed off and grabbed the [...]22 caliber rifle which his {{grandfather}} had given him for hunting. He then returned to the kitchen and, when Maude told him not to shoot any birds, fatally shot her in the head before firing twice more into her back. Some accounts allege that Maude Kemper additionally suffered multiple post-mortem stab wounds with a kitchen knife. He then dragged her body out of the kitchen and into her bedroom. When Kemper's grandfather, Edmund Emil Kemper (1892–1964), <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> grocery shopping, Kemper went outside and fatally shot him in the driveway. He was unsure of what to do next and so phoned his mother, who urged him to contact the local police. Kemper then called the police and waited for them to take him into custody.|$|E

500|$|Troy Middleton was {{the fifth}} of nine {{children}} and grew {{up at the end}} of the 19th century on a 400-acre plantation in southeastern Copiah County. [...] The plantation was virtually a self-contained community, and he had a variety of chores to do depending on the season, with sausage-stuffing being one of his favorites. The local Lick Creek and Strong River had plentiful fish that he would catch, and he loved to hunt, particularly with his 12-gauge shotgun. [...] While his family was Episcopal by heritage, they worshiped at the Bethel Baptist Church, a few miles west of Georgetown, the only church reachable on a Sunday morning. [...] His education was conducted at the small Bethel schoolhouse, near the Bethel Church, but in the summertime he was tutored by his oldest sister Emily, who <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Blue Mountain College to share her knowledge of different subjects with her family. [...] Having exhausted all the educational opportunities available at home, Middleton's father asked him if he was interested in a college education. Finding this an attractive proposition, in the summer of 1904, at the age of fourteen, Middleton made the 172-mile train trip to Starkville, where he would begin his studies at Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (Mississippi A), later to become Mississippi State University.|$|E
500|$|Inspired {{partially}} by Debra, {{and partially}} by {{his desire to}} be a better family man than Arthur, Dexter considers giving up killing people. After convincing his wife Rita (Julie Benz) to go safely out of town, Dexter searches for Arthur, eventually tracking him down and capturing him. Dexter insists he is not like Arthur, but Arthur insists they are both the same. Right before he is killed with a framing hammer, Arthur tells Dexter [...] "It's already over." [...] Disposing of Arthur's body on his boat afterwards, Dexter comes to realize that his love for his family is starting to outweigh his need to kill, and he begins to hope for a future without killing. But upon returning home, he finds a message from Rita that she <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the airport because she forgot her identification. Dexter returns her phone call, only to find that Rita's cell phone and bags are in the house. Dexter hears Harrison crying in the bathroom and finds Rita dead in the bathtub. Harrison sits in a pool of Rita's blood on the bathroom floor, in the same manner that Dexter was left in a pool of his mother's blood during his youth, which gave Dexter his murderous tendencies.|$|E
500|$|The {{day that}} a new poll showed McCain five points ahead in the state, Bush allied himself on stage with a {{marginal}} and controversial veterans activist named J. Thomas Burch, who accused McCain of having [...] "abandoned the veterans" [...] on POW/MIA and Agent Orange issues: [...] "He <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Vietnam and forgot us." [...] Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush complained was [...] "about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary and many Republicans thought comparing Bush's truthfulness to Bill Clinton's dishonesty was distasteful smear by McCain." [...] An unidentified party began a semi-underground smear campaign against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, audience plants, and the like. [...] These claimed most famously that he had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter Bridget was adopted from Bangladesh; this misrepresentation {{was thought to be}} an especially effective slur in a Deep South state where race was still central), but also that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. [...] The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with these attacks; Bush said he would fire anyone who ran defamatory push polls. During a break in a debate, Bush put his hand on McCain's arm and reiterated that he had no involvement in the attacks; McCain replied, [...] "Don't give me that shit.
