40|$|Background. P 1 adhesin protein (170 -kDa) is {{responsible}} for the interaction between M. pneumoniae and the host. Such protein is the target of specific antibodies produced by the host in response to M. pneumoniae infection. Objectives. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance of serological tests for Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG and IgM on chemiluminescence analyzer LIAISON® and to demonstrate how the determination of specific antibodies is the main tool for accurate diagnosis of Mycoplasma infection. Study Design. Eighty-one unselected samples were assayed by ELISA kits Vircell IgG and IgM (bacterial lysate) and LIAISON® Mycoplasma IgG and IgM (recombinant protein P 1). The discordant samples were tested with ELISA Savyon Serorecombinant IgG and IgM (recombinant protein P 1) and reclassified according to the consensus rule. Results. Fifty-one samples were concordant between ELISA Vircell IgG and LIAISON® Mycoplasma IgG. After resolution of the 30 discordant: twenty-eight samples were classified concordant negative and one positive. Seventy-seven samples were concordant between ELISA Vircell IgM and LIAISON® Mycoplasma IgM. After resolution of 4 discordant samples: three samples were classified as negative. Conclusions. The higher correlation between LIAISON® and Savyon Serorecombinant is determined by the use of recombinant protein P 1 in the solid phase and the type of <b>cut-off</b> <b>calculation</b> allows high specificity and sensitivity. The Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG and IgM kits, performed in full automation on LIAISON® analyzer, show characteristics comparable to other kits and an easy handling of the sample...|$|E

40|$|Compact {{formulas}} {{are obtained}} for the Casimir energy of a relativistic perfect fluid confined to a $D$-dimensional hypercube with von Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions. The formulas are conveniently expressed as a finite sum of the well-known gamma and Riemann zeta functions. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} mathematical technique used to extract the Casimir energy from a $D$-dimensional infinite sum regularized with an exponential <b>cut-off.</b> Numerical <b>calculations</b> show that initially the Dirichlet energy decreases rapidly in magnitude and oscillates in sign, being positive for even $D$ and negative for odd $D$. This oscillating pattern stops abruptly at the critical dimension of D= 36 after which the energy remains negative and the magnitude increases. We show that numerical calculations performed with 16 -digit precision are inaccurate at higher values of $D$. Comment: 20 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} electromagnetic wave propagation in parallel plate chirowaveguide is presented. The waveguide {{is filled with}} a chiral material having diagonal anisotropic constitutive parameters. The propagation characterization in this medium is based on algebraic formulation of Maxwell’s equations combined with the constitutive relations. Three propagation regions are identified: the fast-fast-wave region, the fast-slow-wave region, and the slow-slow-wave region. This paper focuses completely on the propagation in the first region, where the dispersion modal equations are obtained and solved. The <b>cut-off</b> frequencies <b>calculation</b> leads to three cases of the plane wave propagation in anisotropic chiral medium. The particularity of these results {{is the possibility of}} controlling the appropriate cut-off frequencies by choosing the adequate physical parameters values. The specificity of this study lies in the bifurcation modes confirmation and the possible contribution to the design of optical devices such as high-pass filters, as well as positive and negative propagation constants. This negative constant is an important feature of metamaterials which shows the phenomena of backward waves. Original results of the biaxial anisotropic chiral metamaterial are obtained and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Radio relic {{sources in}} galaxy {{clusters}} are {{often described as}} the remnants of powerful radio galaxies. Here we develop {{a model for the}} evolution of such relics after the jets cease to supply energy to the lobes. This includes the treatment of a relic overpressured with respect to its gaseous surroundings even after the jets switch off. We also determine the radio emission of relics for a large variety of assumptions. We take into account the evolution of the strength of the magnetic field during the phase of relativistic particle injection into the lobes. The resulting spectra show mild steepening at around 1 GHz but avoid any exponential spectral <b>cut-offs.</b> The model <b>calculations</b> are used to fit the observed spectra of seven radio relics.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{perform a}} {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis {{of the effectiveness}} of laser therapy (LT) in the prevention of oral mucositis (OM) in patients undergoing oncotherapy. MethodsA search was conducted in the MEDLINE, LILACS, and Cochrane databases using the keywords “laser therapy” and “oral mucositis” in order to perform this systematic review and meta-analysis. The case-control studies included were submitted to odds ratio (OR) analysis, whose <b>cut-off</b> for statistic <b>calculation</b> was OM grade ≥ 3. Calculations were performed with the BioEstat program, release 5. 0, using DerSimonian-Laird's random effects statistical analysis. ResultsIn this systematic review, twelve studies were included; the meta-analysis of seven of them demonstrated that LT in patients undergoing oncotherapy is approximately 10 times more effective in the prevention of OM grade ≥ 3 than in patients without laser treatment (OR: 9. 5281; 95 % CI: 1. 447 - 52. 0354; p= 0. 0093). ConclusionThe data demonstrated the significant prophylactic effect of OM grade ≥ 3 in patients undergoing LT. Further studies, with larger sample sizes, are needed for better evaluation of LT's prophylactic effect on OM grade ≥ 3...|$|R
40|$|Thermalization in an {{expanding}} parton plasma is studied {{within the framework}} of Boltzmann equation {{in the absence of any}} mean fields. In particular, we study the time-dependence of the relaxation time to the lowest order in finite temperature QCD and how such time-dependence affects the thermalization of {{an expanding}} parton plasma. Because of Debye screening and Landau damping at finite temperature, the relaxation time (or transport rates) is free of infrared divergencies in both longitudinal and transverse interactions. The resultant relaxation time decreases with time in an expanding plasma like 1 /τ β, with β < 1. We prove in this case that thermal equilibrium will eventually be established given a long life-time of the system. However, a fixed momentum <b>cut-off</b> in the <b>calculation</b> of the relaxation time gives rise to a much stronger time dependence which will slow down thermal equilibrium. It is also demonstrated that the “memory effect ” of the initial condition affects the approach to thermal equilibrium and the final entropy production. PACS numbers: 12. 38. Mh, 25. 75 +r, 12. 38.

40|$|Background: Numerous {{serological}} tests {{for the detection}} of Helicobacter pylori infection have been developed. However, many perform poorly when evaluated in the Chinese population. Aim: To search for optimal {{serological tests}} {{for the detection of}} H. pylori infection in Chinese patients. Methods: Consecutive dyspeptic patients referred for upper endoscopy were recruited. During endoscopy, gastric biopsies were taken for the CLOtest™ and histological examination. Patients were then given a 13 C-urea breath test. Sera were used to test for H. pylori infection, employing three commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (pylori DTect, HP IgG and GAP IgG). Results were compared with the gold standard defined by the CLOtest™, histology and 13 Curea breath test. Results: Among the 142 patients (47 male, 95 female; mean age, 49 years) recruited, 81 (57 %) were H. pyloripositive. 57 (40 %) were H. pylori-negative and four (3 %) were defined to be indeterminate. Using a self-defined <b>cut-off</b> value after <b>calculation,</b> the best accuracies for the pylori DTect, HP IgG and GAP IgG tests were 97 %, 91 % and 80 %. respectively. Conclusions: The pylori DTect test is an optimal serological test for the detection of H. pylori infection in Hong Kong Chinese patients. The HP IgG test may be used as an alternative. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This work aims to {{characterize}} the dynamic behavior of a four bladed inducer and clarify the physical mechanism {{that leads to the}} onset of rotating cavitation. The inducer under consideration is representative of a low-pressure liquid oxygen pump (LPOP) inducer of modern design and incorporates several standard design features used in rocket turbopumps to suppress rotating cavitation. The mechanism is characterized based on a combination of two-phase numerical simulations and inducer experiments. Experimental measurements demonstrate a supersynchronous rotating cavity in the periphery of the inducer inlet at frequencies between 1. 2 and 1. 6 times rotor frequency and a synchronous 2 nd spatial harmonic pattern associated with alternate blade cavitation. The analysis indicates a causal link between alternate blade cavitation and rotating cavitation, with a distinct cut-on <b>cut-off</b> behavior. Numerical <b>calculations</b> and high-speed videos elucidate the mechanism of breakdown of alternate blade cavitation and the formation of rotating cavitation. The present work suggests that rotating cavitation is caused by the coupling of the cavities on adjacent blades during alternate blade cavitation. Due to the nearly tangential flow, the vortex lines from one of the non-cavitating blades wrap around the blade leading edge of the adjacent blade, which yields a drop in static pressure and cavity formation. The tip vortex cavity interaction with {{the leading edge of the}} blade leads to sheet cavity breakdown with periodic growth and collapse of cavities, creating the apparent super-synchronous rotation of the cavitating region.

40|$|Intermolecular binding {{underlies}} every metabolic {{and regulatory}} {{processes of the}} cell, and the therapeutic and pharmacological properties of drugs. Molecular docking systems model and simulate these interactions in silico and allow us to study the binding process. Haptic-based docking provides an immersive virtual docking environment where the user can interact with and guide the molecules to their binding pose. Moreover, it allows human perception, intuition and knowledge to assist and accelerate the docking process, and reduces incorrect binding poses. Crucial for interactive docking is the real-time calculation of interaction forces. For smooth and accurate haptic exploration and manipulation, force-feedback cues have to be updated {{at a rate of}} 1 kHz. Hence, force calculations must be performed within 1 ms. To achieve this, modern haptic-based docking approaches often utilize pre-computed force grids and linear interpolation. However, such grids are time-consuming to pre-compute (especially for large molecules), memory hungry, can induce rough force transitions at cell boundaries and cannot be applied to flexible docking. Here we propose an efficient proximity querying method for computing intermolecular forces in real time. Our motivation is the eventual development of a haptic-based docking solution that can model molecular flexibility. Uniquely in a haptics application we use octrees to decompose the 3 D search space in order to identify the set of interacting atoms within a <b>cut-off</b> distance. Force <b>calculations</b> are then performed on this set in real time. The implementation constructs the trees dynamically, and computes the interaction forces of large molecular structures (i. e. consisting of thousands of atoms) within haptic refresh rates. We have implemented this method in an immersive, haptic-based, rigid-body, molecular docking application called Haptimol_RD. The user can use the haptic device to orientate the molecules in space, sense the interaction forces on the device, and guide the molecules to their binding pose. Haptimol_RD is designed to run on consumer level hardware, i. e. {{there is no need for}} specialized/proprietary hardware...|$|R
40|$|Session - Current Issues in Maternal and Child Health and Well-Being: paper no. 26286 BACKGROUND: In recent decades, patient {{participation}} in healthcare decisions has been increasingly encouraged as {{it gives a}} sense of empowerment and autonomy. However, such responsibility may induce stress for infertile patients who experienced more than one cycle of in vitrofertilization (IVF) treatment, especially in the patrilineal field of medicine where attending doctors are male-dominated. Given the unfulfilled wish of childbearing, lack of definite <b>cut-off</b> point, and <b>calculation</b> of cost in treatment discontinuation, patients often encounter a decisional crossroad to choose whether to pursue further or discontinue IVF cycles after experiencing failure. To date, {{little is known about}} women’s preferred role in treatment decision making in the context of infertility, decisional dilemmas and complexity of factors such as physical, psychosocial, religious and cultural influence. This study examined the impact of decision role preference, prospective treatment experience and decisional regret on a longitudinal scale to inform clinicians in their facilitation of infertile patient in treatment decision making. METHODS: 130 women who experienced IVF treatment failure by indication of negative pregnancy test were recruited at a university-affiliated reproductive medicine clinic. With consent, they completed questionnaires asking their history of infertility treatment, preferred roles in treatment decision-making, perception of treatment outcome and mood at three time-points: announcement of treatment failure (T 0), when they made a subsequent treatment decision (T 1) and three months afterwards (T 2). The study spanned 18 months. RESULTS: On average, participants were aged 37. 0 (SD= 3. 5), married for 7. 4 years (SD= 3. 7), and being diagnosed of subfertility for 4. 1 years (SD= 2. 45). Majority received tertiary education and had a full-time job. Most women were classified as passive decision makers, preferred minimal shared responsibility (41. 9 %), or a totally passive role (40. 4 %). 89. 4 % of them regarded doctors are best to decide subsequent treatments, only 10. 1 % preferred shared responsibility. No respondents preferred an autonomous role. Regarding treatment discontinuation, most participants preferred minimal involvement and highly dependent on physicians for final decisions (84. 3 %); only a small proportion preferred shared responsibility (7. 1 %), or uphold autonomy (8. 6 %) in the process. Nonetheless, regression analysis identified a subgroup of women (N= 41) who believed doctors, not patients, should make decisions in general at T 0, but nonetheless wanted a bigger role in deciding their IVF treatments at T 1. These women experienced significantly higher treatment regret (β=. 076, p <. 001) and depressed mood at T 2 (β=. 152, p <. 05), even after controlling for depressed mood at T 1. IMPLICATIONS: Results showed when conflict arises between the belief that doctors know best and the desire to have {{a more active role in}} IVF treatment planning, women experience greater regret and become more depressed. Hence, identification with traditional beliefs of childbearing, which emphasizes the patrilineal culture, will be associated with worse psychological outcome among patients. The study underline the importance of cultural sensitivity in addressing fertility-related issues in order to better facilitate psychosocial support at the clinic, as well as to empower these women to express their patients’ concerns and decisional preferences throughout the course of medical treatment.
