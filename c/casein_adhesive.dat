50|$|The de Havilland Albatross {{airliner}} of 1936 had a fuselage {{of wooden}} sandwich construction: wafers of birch plywood were spaced apart by a balsa sheet and glued by a <b>casein</b> <b>adhesive.</b> This same construction, but with Aerolite, a urea-formaldehyde adhesive, achieved fame with its wartime {{use in the}} DH.98 Mosquito fast bomber. As well as being a construction of light weight and high performance, it also avoided the use of aluminium, a strategic material during wartime, and could use the skills of woodworkers, rather than those of specialised aircraft metalworkers.|$|E
30|$|An {{interesting}} observation {{was made}} during LIBS measurements performed at different spots over the brown painted areas. At the 1 st laser pulse analysis, chromium (Cr) was clearly detected {{but was not}} further observed during analysis at the same spot with the 2 nd and the following pulses. This implies {{that the existence of}} Cr is only superficial. It is noted that no lead (Pb) was detected, which in correlation with Cr could suggest the superficial existence of chromium yellow used in the yellow paint. Noticing that at the brown area investigated, it is seen that {{a small part of the}} paint is missing, in a way that indicates a local intervention performed at a later time, it could be speculated that the localized and superficial presence of Cr could be correlated with the application of an adhesive during a modern restoration (e.g. a lime free <b>casein</b> <b>adhesive</b> in which commonly an oxide or salt of chromium is added to improve water resistance) [40].|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} years {{increased}} numbers of studies about {{the implementation of}} adhesive bonding in timber engineering were published. Current practice is to use two-component (2 K) epoxies and polyurethanes in conjunction with threaded steel bars, reinforced concrete bars, and rods made of fibre reinforces polymer. All these material might be considered questionable in terms of sustainable ecology. The current paper investigates the possible substitution of afore mentioned metallic bars by hardwood dowels, and the polymer based adhesives by glutine and casein based ones. It summarises experimental investigations carried out with different geometric parameters, in which beech (a hardwood) rods were glued into spruce (a softwood) blocks. Joint capacities achieved using glutine and <b>casein</b> based <b>adhesives</b> were compared with results using 2 K epoxies and 2 K polyurethane adhesives under dry conditions, and {{under the influence of}} moisture. Results indicate that current glutine and <b>casein</b> <b>adhesives,</b> if used under dry conditions, achieve similar strength; however, that the influence of moisture is still a limiting factor that severely restricts their usage under adverse conditions. The presentation of the results is completed by a numerical modelling of the considered joints, including a methodology to predict their capacity with a reasonable degree of accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Jatropha press cake, {{by-product}} after oil expression from Jatropha seeds, contains 24 – 28 % protein on dry basis. Objectives of {{this research}} were to investigate functional properties, such as solubility, emulsifying, foaming, film forming, and adhesive properties, of Jatropha press cake proteins and compared those with relevant industrial proteins. From our study, we found that protein extracted from press cake proteins had a solubility of about 90 % above pH 9. Emulsifying properties of press cake protein were comparable to sodium caseinates and reached the highest value at pH 9 – 10. Jatropha proteins formed films with tensile strength of 0. 4 – 1. 8 MPa with 10 – 75 % elongation, which were below soy protein or wheat-gluten. Further oil removal from press cake decreased emulsifying properties, while increased foaming and adhesive properties of the extracted proteins. Protein extracted from de-oiled press cake showed better foaming properties than sodium caseinate at pH 10, but lower than egg white protein at all pH. Furthermore, press cake protein showed better <b>adhesive</b> properties than <b>casein</b> <b>adhesives</b> at the same dry matter content. Based on these results, Jatropha press cake protein showed most promising results on adhesive and emulsifying properties, which indicate the potential of Jatropha press cake protein as emulsifier or paper adhesive...|$|R
50|$|Tego {{film was}} {{developed}} in Germany around 1930 as a glue for waterproof plywood. It comprised a paper sheet pre-impregnated with a resole phenolic resin. When heated, assembled between wood veneers and then compressed, a strong and waterproof laminated plywood was formed. Most plywood at this time used other <b>adhesives,</b> such as <b>casein.</b> These <b>adhesives</b> were generally applied as aqueous solutions, which caused warping of thin veneers and {{made it difficult to}} achieve a solid laminate without risk of voids. As Tego film was used dry, it gave a high integrity result, solid and without risk of hidden weaknesses. This became an important factor in time, when it was applied to use in aircraft construction.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this work, two proteins, Z-domains and bovine casein, were autodisplayed on {{the outer}} {{membrane}} of the same Escherichia coli cells by co-transformation of two different autodisplay vectors. On the basis of SDS-PAGE densitometry, Z-domains and bovine casein were expressed at 3. 12 × 105 and 1. 55 × 105 proteins/E. coli cell, respectively. The co-autodisplayed Z-domains had antibody-binding activity and the bovine <b>casein</b> had <b>adhesive</b> properties. E. coli with co-autodisplayed proteins were analyzed by fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS). E. coli with co-autodisplayed Z-domains and bovine casein aggregated due to hydrophobic interaction. For application to immunoassays, the Z-domain activity was estimated after (1) immobilizing the E. coli and (2) forming an OM layer. E. coli with co-autodisplayed two proteins that were immobilized on a polystyrene microplate had the same antibody-binding activity as did E. coli with autodisplayed Z-domains only. The OM layer from the co-transformed E. coli had Z-domains and bovine casein expressed at a 1 : 2 ratio from antibody-binding activity measurements...|$|R
50|$|One {{example is}} a simple paste made by cooking flour in water. Starch-based {{adhesives}} are used in corrugated board and paper sack production, paper tube winding, and wallpaper <b>adhesives.</b> <b>Casein</b> glue is mainly used to adhere glass bottle labels. Animal glues have traditionally been used in bookbinding, wood joining, and many other areas but now are largely replaced by synthetic glues except in specialist applications like the production and repair of stringed instruments. Albumen made from the protein component of blood {{has been used in}} the plywood industry. Masonite, a wood hardboard, was originally bonded using natural wood lignin, an organic polymer, though most modern particle boards such as MDF use synthetic thermosetting resins.|$|R
3000|$|Bonding {{properties}} of konjac glucomannan (KGM), chitosan, and their composites were investigated. After preparing three-ply plywood glued with these materials, the dry bond {{strength and the}} bond strength after water immersion treatment were measured. The bond strength of urea-formaldehyde resin <b>adhesive,</b> <b>casein,</b> and soybean glues was also studied for comparison. KGM developed relatively good dry bond strength in extremely small solid amounts, irrespective of alkaline treatment. However, the water resistance was extremely low {{for all of the}} conditions. Chitosan also developed good dry bond strength in small solid amounts and was better than conventional adhesives. Chitosan also exhibited excellent water resistance compared to casein and soybean glues. When KGM and chitosan were combined, the adhesiveness under the dry condition was enhanced, and the bonding properties were superior to those of casein and soybean glues. Therefore, it is expected that chitosan and chitosan–KGM composite can be used as environmentally friendly wood adhesives.|$|R
