Moreover, economic analysis and application of the economist’s tools make possible certain appreciable conclusions for the public-sector decision maker and for this particular public health issue, as we tried to show with an application to two European ASE programs. When the French system is termed ‘techno-centric’ and the British speed camera programme is characterized by its polycentrism, we emphasize on the importance of the institutional dimension. These particular institutional frames were selected, because the government expected they were the most adapted ones to reach the objectives of public policy. Their implementation would be made more easily considering the country institutional organization. The British system shows a greater flexibility to be adjusted to local considerations, whereas it requires more costs of coordination for its operation. The French system with a higher degree of centralization than its British counterpart is less flexible, but it requires a more simple organization for current speed enforcement operation. <b>Contingent</b> <b>considerations</b> are undoubtedly at stake when an adapted institutional design is chosen.|$|R

We focus on the use of earnouts following changes to the accounting treatment of <b>contingent</b> <b>consideration</b> following the 2008 introduction of SFAS 141 (R). The revised standards require earnout fair value to be recorded at acquisition date, while earnouts under the previous standards were only reported if, and when, they were paid.

40|$|Abstract. A {{longitudinal}} study {{looked at the}} impact of a two-day leadership-training program on transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership in a large manufacturing organization in eastern India. Data was collected from 31 subordinates on the leadership behaviors of their managers before and six months after the managers attended a training program. Matched sample t-test does not reveal any significant difference in ratings between the two periods on any leadership variable. Results also show that pre-training ratings significantly predict post-training ratings in the case of idealized influence-behavior, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, individualized <b>consideration,</b> <b>contingent</b> reward, and active management-by-exception. There is no such effect in the case of idealized influence-attributed, passive management-by-exception and laissez-faire leadership.

Two secondary schools from urban and rural area were selected for the study. Data were collected using questionnaire and interview techniques. The questionnaire was distributed to a total of 188 randomly selected teacher respondents and 155 questionnaires were returned. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The principals' leadership styles of this study are idealized influence-attribute, idealized influence-behaviour, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, individualized <b>consideration,</b> <b>contingent</b> reward, management by exception active, management by exception-passive, laissez-faire leadership, extra effort, effectiveness, and satisfaction. The data reveals that transformational leadership components were practiced at a frequent level by principals. On the other hand, transactional leadership components were still practiced by principals but at a moderate level and principals show low interest in incorporate Laissez-Faire leadership. Furthermore, teachers' gender, and secondary schools' location do not influence the level of leadership behaviours components practiced by principals. Additionally, teachers from different years in service perceived that principals' leadership behaviour increases when teachers' year in service increase, for example, principals' idealized influence attribute, Laissez-Faire leadership, effectiveness and satisfaction.

40|$|The principal’s {{leadership}} and curriculum development {{are considered the}} core elements for creating a high performing junior high school. In Taiwan, mathematics curriculum reform has been an ongoing topic since 1994. The pedagogy, classroom interactions, and the underlying philosophy of mathematics education have varied with different versions of guidelines. These changes inevitably increase the requirement for principals’ leadership in order to effectively implement the curriculum reform. Principals’ leadership {{is essential to the}} success of the implementation in their school. This study aimed to explore and identify the leadership of junior high school principals whose schools had been judged by the Taipei City Government as Grade A junior high schools. Principals’ implementations of the reformed mathematics curriculum were used as examples to generate insights of their leadership. This study drew upon a multiple-case study approach. Data were collected from interviews, observations, and documentations. Bass and Avolio’s (1997) full range leadership theory provided a structure for gaining insight into these principals’ leadership practices. Five Grade A Taipei junior high school principals participated and shared their leadership concepts and experiences. Findings revealed that the leadership preferences of the five principles varied considerably. Management by exception-active, <b>contingent</b> reward, individualised <b>consideration,</b> and idealised influence were Grade A Taipei junior high school principals’ preferred leadership practices. In addition, principals’ leadership strategies associated with these practices were identified. These principals had adopted a range of leadership strategies according to the staff and school needs. Results of this study have implications for both Taiwanese principals and education departments. Principals can enhance their leadership by gaining more understanding about the Grade A principals’ leadership practices and strategies. Taiwanese education departments can improve school leadership training programs by focusing on these practices and strategies, which may also lead to more effective strategies for implementing national curriculum reform...|$|R
40|$|Personal and {{collective}} emotions {{play an important}} role in our private and social lives. Educational research suggests that emotions are powerful motivational forces that can impact upon leadership practices as well as on teaching and learning at individual and classroom level. However, less is known about the role of emotional experiences and displays in relation to leadership practices and school outcomes at organisational level. In order to develop more substantial knowledge, this mixed method study aims to explore the relationship between leadership styles, emotions and school outcomes from an organisational perspective in several urban schools from Timisoara, Romania. A sample of 408 teaching and non-teaching staff from 18 schools took part in a survey and 14 participants from two selected case study schools took part in semi-structured interviews. A widely used model of leadership is proposed by Bass & Avolio (1994) who identify transformational, transactional and laissez-faire practices. In this study, the quantitative data analysis using the Multifactorial Leadership Questionnaire developed by Bass and Avolio (ibid) suggests that a hybrid leadership that combines transformational and transactional elements such as <b>contingent</b> reward, individual <b>consideration</b> and charismatic behaviours is positively associated with positive emotions such as joy, enthusiasm and hope and with better outcomes such as perceived school success. The survey findings identify more variation and subtlety of negative emotions compared to positive emotions and also examine the role of self-other rapport in experiencing and displaying emotion at work. Secondly, the qualitative data reveal various contextualized meanings of leadership, emotions and school success, provides an integrated perspective of findings and allows for comparison of the overall results with previously published literature. Furthermore, the thesis presents emergent theoretical models for the study of leadership, emotions and school development and performance. Finally, the implications of the overall findings for policy and practice are discussed by taking into consideration the Romanian cultural and educational context.

Kivlighan, Jr. Department of Counseling and Personnel Services The {{purpose of}} this research {{study was to examine}} the relationship of self-perceived leadership, acculturation and individualistic/collectivistic behaviors in Latino women leaders. Using a canonical correlational design, the study aimed at investigating how acculturation and individualistic/collectivistic behaviors relate to leadership of 524 Latina U. S. Army active duty officers with a participation rate of 72 %. The study used a quantitative, descriptive, and exploratory research approach to answer the following research questions: What are Latino women's self-perceptions of their leadership style? How does acculturation relate to leadership? What is the relationship between acculturation and Latino women's self-perceptions of their leadership style? What is the relationship of individualism/collectivism on the relationship between leadership and acculturation? How does individualism and collectivism relate to Latino women's self-perceptions of their leadership style? Correlational and t-test analyses were performed to compare the study's findings with those reported in previous research based on samples drawn from the MLQ. Correlation coefficients were computed to examine the relationship among demographic, leadership, acculturation, and individualism/collectivism variables. A canonical correlation was used to investigate the relationship between the set of variables of leadership and acculturation, acculturation and individualism/collectivism. Results indicated that the factor structure of the scales previously reported from Anglo cultures did fit the data from the Latina sample. These Latina officers, however, reported higher levels of transformational and lower levels of transactional leadership than normative samples. Significant canonical correlations were found among the variables under investigation that showed two types of canonical roots: Latina Collectivist and Active Transformational Leadership and Marginalized Individualistic and Passive Transactional Leadership. The Latina Collectivist and Active Transformational Leadership root was composed of the following variables: Latino Orientation, Horizontal and Vertical Collectivism, Idealized Influence (Behavior), Inspirational Motivation, <b>Contingent</b> Reward, Idealized <b>Consideration,</b> Intellectual Stimulation, Idealized Influence (Attributed), Laissez-Faire Leadership, and Management-by-Exception (Active). The Marginalized Individualistic and Passive Transactional Leadership root was composed of the following variables: Anglo Marginality, Latino Marginality, Latino/Hispanic Marginality, Horizontal and Vertical Individualism, Laissez-Faire Leadership, Intellectual Stimulation, Management-by-Exception (Active) and Management-by-Exception (Passive). Findings confirm Bass and Avolio (2004) contention that collectivist cultures nurture transformational leadership. Implications, limitations, and directions for future research were discussed...|$|R

Each set of facts will give rise to different considerations. It is possible, however, to identify some general points raised by the application of the polluter pays principle (‘PPP’) in the context of liability for the management, movement and disposal of historic CMS: A Costs and liabilities cannot be transferred or recovered unless there is some specific legal mechanism which allows them to be transferred or recovered. B The application of liability regimes and principles to CMS Case Studies suggests that liability on the part of ‘historic polluters’ will not be imposed in most cases of ‘Operational Management’ liabilities C Whilst liability for remedial works required to address CMS in situ might be more readily established, such cases are generally outside the scope of the project D Even where the requirements for establishing liability in law can be met, there may be significant legal and practical obstacles to actually securing money or actions from other parties E The application of the Environmental Liability Directive (‘ELD’) is limited to <b>Contingent</b> Liabilities F <b>Consideration</b> of the ‘Hypotheticals’ relating to novel operational management techniques suggests that the nature of Contingent Liabilities which might arise can be complex G Ownership of CMS sites, and disposal sites, is important as it can result in liability, but will not usually do so where remedial works are not required H The identity of the ‘polluter’ can be considered from different perspectives, including that of the person creating environmental risks, so that there are justifications for applying the PPP to those undertaking CMS Operational Management activities I A range of structures and techniques for the management of Contingent Liabilities can be employed in order to allocate and address legal risk...|$|R

Exploration of this topic filled a void in empirical investigations of the psychological gender perspective of school leadership. Multivariate Analysis of Variance techniques were used to examine the relationships between and among principal psychological gender role, biological gender, principal effectiveness, teacher satisfaction, and teacher extra effort. Additionally, canonical correlation was used to examine the relationship between leadership factor variable set and psychological gender role variable set.

40|$|As the UK {{energy sector}} {{moves to a}} greater {{contribution}} from low-carbon and renewable sources it faces significant challenges in delivering affordability, security of supply and sustainability. Although hydropower in Scotland emerged {{on a large scale}} in the mid- 20 th century against an influential, changing wider context of energy policy, environmental regulation and debate, it is now subject to an evolving renewables agenda. This further shapes the national and scheme level characteristics of hydropower and in turn outcomes for the water environment. <b>Contingent</b> upon these <b>considerations,</b> hydropower regulation must now deliver on EU obligations to protect and improve the ecological status of water bodies, whilst also supporting domestic efforts to meet high profile binding renewable energy targets. Yet, despite an acknowledged potential for energy policy to constrain the delivery of water policy objectives, there is little policy harmonisation between disciplines. As Scotland orientates itself as a leader in Europe on climate change, transitioning to increasing amounts of renewable generation across a handful of technologies, there is a gap in knowledge about how specific renewable policies and trends can influence hydropower sustainability outcomes and regulatory challenges. This thesis therefore contributes an innovative and timely critical examination of the effect a changing wider renewable energy and policy context has on hydropower sustainability in Scotland, at a scheme and national level. This research uses an interdisciplinary, temporal analysis to identify linkages and create dialogue between disciplines and scales, informing the pursuit of sustainable renewable energy through policy and regulation in a changing world. It finds firstly, that the changing national generation mix towards an increased contribution from renewable sources, including potentially intermittent technologies such as wind power, has contributed to an alteration in the operational characteristics and reservoir variability profile of Cruachan pumped-storage scheme, presenting positive outcomes for reservoir littoral habitats. Secondly, it finds that whilst not operating in isolation, renewable energy incentive policies, through their eligibility criteria, financial reward frameworks and timing, influence hydropower characteristics and sustainability challenges, providing trade-offs but also synergies for hydropower regulation. Finally, it finds that there is a degree of divergence in hydropower outcomes and challenges in Scotland and Norway, due to the characteristics and especially interaction of wider contextual elements such as topography, profile of precipitation input, national energy needs and the role of regional and municipal government. By highlighting these linkages, this thesis is of value to energy policy and environmental regulation in Scotland and across the EU, and is seen as a first step in addressing these uncertainties and supporting a more integrated and sustainable hydropower and renewables governance framework...|$|R

[...] University of Melbourne, Dept. of Education Policy and Management, 2003 Teacher {{perceptions}} of the leadership of their principal were explored in seven independent girls' schools in Melbourne, Australia. Teacher ratings of principal leadership and principal self-ratings were gathered using Bass and Avolio's Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ 5 x Revised). The ratings were compared to teacher characteristics including gender, age, years of teaching, years at the school, work locus of control, school division, and school. There were differences between teacher and principal self-ratings and notably {{more so than in}} previous research. It was found that the principals were rated as being high in three of the five transformational behaviours, idealized attributes, idealized behaviours and inspirational motivation, but lower in intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration and the transactional behaviour of contingent reward. Teachers also rated their actual. principal lower in all three outcomes (extra effort, effectiveness and satisfaction). This differed from principal self-ratings in that principals believed themselves to be high in all five transformational leadership behaviours, contingent reward and all three outcomes. There were significant differences in teacher perception of principal leadership associated with teacher characteristics of age, years of teaching, tenure at the school, school division, gender, and work locus of control. Variation in teacher work locus of control, gender and division were particularly notable, although, overall, variance in perception of principal leadership explained by teacher characteristics was low, accounting for approximately 8 % of variance on most leadership behaviours. However when school was included with teacher characteristics, up to 25 % of the variance in teacher perception of principal leadership was accounted for, suggesting that the work context principals find themselves in can have a large impact on {{perceptions of}} their leadership. Teachers were also asked to rate their ideal principal. Compared to ratings of their actual principal, teachers rated their ideal principal higher in intellectual stimulation, individualized <b>consideration,</b> <b>contingent</b> reward and all three leadership outcomes, and at similar levels for management by exception active and passive, and non-leadership. Teacher division, gender, and work locus of control were all significant in variance in perception of ideal principal leadership. Secondary teachers recorded significantly higher idealized attributes in their ideal principal than did primary teachers. Female teachers recorded significantly higher idealized attributes, inspirational motivation and the outcome of extra effort as compared with male teachers in their ideal principal. A teacher with a higher work locus of control rated their ideal principal as using more non-leadership and rated the outcomes of ideal leadership as lower than did a teacher with a low work locus of control. The complexity of responses is noteworthy, more so because this is the first instance of the MLQ being used to record perceptions of ideal leadership.

De nombreuses études montrent que ces différentes formes de leadership ont un impact important sur plusieurs attitudes et comportements des employés, mais encore très peu de chercheurs se sont intéressés aux processus par lesquels les leaders produisent de tels effets. À cet effet, nos résultats font ressortir que la confiance et le soutien constituent des mécanismes cruciaux pour expliquer l’effet du leadership sur l’engagement organisationnel des employés. Over {{the last}} few years, the transformational, transactional and laissez-faire leadership theory has {{attracted the attention of}} many researchers (Judge and Piccolo, 2004; Lowe and Gardner, 2000, Yammarino et al., 2005). Furthermore, numerous studies (Bycio, Hackett and Allen, 1995; Dumdum, Lowe and Avolio, 2002; Rafferty and Griffin, 2004; Yammarino, Spangler and Dubinsky, 1998) have shown that these three forms of leadership {{have a significant impact on}} several employee attitudes and behaviours, including affective organizational commitment, which is characterized by an individual’s emotional attachment to his company (Meyer and Allen, 1997). Nevertheless, there are still very few researchers taking an interest in the processes through which leaders can produce such effects (Bass and Riggio, 2006; Bono and Judge, 2003; Yukl, 2006). Only a few authors have tackled this problem, particularly by identifying empowerment (Avolio et al., 2004) and fairness (Pillai, Schriesheim and Williams, 1999) as mechanisms explaining the relationship between transformational leadership and employees’ affective commitment. We intend to build on these recent results in improving the understanding of this dynamic. Based on the social exchange theory (Blau, 1964), this research is aimed at exploring how supervisors can strengthen their employees’ affective commitment. More specifically, we will assess the extent to which support and trust can account for the influence of each of the dimensions associated with transformational, transactional and laissez-faire leadership has on commitment. These dimensions are: charisma, intellectual stimulation, individualized <b>consideration,</b> <b>contingent</b> reward, active management by exception, and passive avoidance. One of the primary contributions of this article resides in the fact that currently, there are still very few empirical research projects that have focussed on the effects of these dimensions on other variables, and that such research has only concentrated on the influence of global forms of leadership, and almost exclusively on the transformational form. However, recent works have indeed highlighted the importance of using specific dimensions rather than these three major forms of leadership since the later provide an imperfect and oversimplified image of all the leaders’ behaviours and potential (Antonakis, Avolio and Sivasubramaniam, 2003). In addition to filling a gap at this level, the second significant contribution of this project lies in the fact that, to our knowledge, no study has as yet validated the role of support as an intermediate mechanism lying between leadership and affective commitment. In concrete terms, we are first proposing that the charisma, intellectual stimulation, individualized <b>consideration</b> and <b>contingent</b> reward dimensions are positively related to employees’ perceived supervisor support and trust in their supervisor, whereas the active management by exception and passive avoidance dimensions are negatively related to those same two variables. Secondly, we are proposing that employees’ perceived organizational support and trust in their organization act as mediating variables between perceived supervisor support and trust in their supervisor and affective commitment, respectively. This research, which was conducted in the spring of 2004 among all the employees (excluding physicians) of a Quebec hospital center, allowed the collection of 568 questionnaires, representing a 46 % response rate; 80 % of the subjects in the sample were women, whose average age was 43, and who had been working in the organization for 12 years, on average. To test our hypotheses, confirmatory factorial analyses and structural equations were conducted, while controlling for gender and employment status (full time vs. part time). The results of the study indicate that only the charisma dimension seems to lead employees to trust their supervisor. This observation is particularly interesting for researchers with an interest in interpersonal trust since other studies have arrived at similar conclusions (Gillespie and Mann, 2004). However, our results indicate that charisma and contingent reward are positively related to perceived supervisor support whereas active management by exception is negatively associated to it. This observation is particularly important in that it provides responses to the theoretical arguments which were paving the way for such a possibility (Yammarino and Bass, 1990; Jung and Avolio, 2000). Lastly, this research shows that the constructs of perceived supervisor support and perceived organizational support constitute an important explanatory mechanism in the relationship between leadership and affective commitment. Trust in the organization also contributes to explaining the dynamic existing between leadership and commitment; however, it is not significantly influenced by trust in the supervisor. Our results open up several avenues of further research. Although our analyses have identified support and trust as intermediate mechanisms between leadership and commitment, other mediators could still account for this relationship. In addition to exploring this avenue, future research could simultaneously analyze the intermediate variables that have been identified to date in the literature (e. g., support, trust, fairness, empowerment) with respect to commitment, but also to other consequences which are often related to transformational and transactional leadership (e. g., satisfaction, mobilization, performance), in order to better understand their relative importance. Finally, this study has certain limitations, including the difficulty in generalizing results (sample composed of a single organization), the possible inflation of the strength of certain relationships (common variance bias) and the impossibility of inferring the causality of the observed relationships (cross-sectional design). El objetivo de este artículo es de evaluar, sobre la base de la teoría del intercambio social, en qué medida el apoyo y la confianza hacia el superior y la organización permiten de explicar la influencia sobre el compromiso afectivo de los empleados de cada una de las dimensiones asociadas al liderazgo transformacional, transaccional y de “laisser-faire”. Numerosos estudios muestran que estas diferentes formas de liderazgo tienen un impacto importante sobre varias actitudes y comportamientos de los empleados, pero son pocos los investigadores que se interesan a los procesos por los cuales los líderes producen tales efectos. A este propósito, nuestros resultados resaltan que la confianza y el apoyo constituyen mecanismos cruciales para explicar el efecto del liderazgo sobre el compromiso organizacional de los empleados...|$|R
