40|$|Capacity {{planning}} {{is a major}} challenge for service providers facing volatile demand. Inefficiencies result from idle capacity or lost revenue caused by peak loads. Concerning IT-driven services, recent technological developments offering dynamic integration and information capabilities may help. They enable an on-demand exchange of excess capacity between business partners and create value through efficient capacity allocation within a supply chain. This paper aims at examining this economic potential of IT-enabled excess <b>capacity</b> <b>markets.</b> Therefore, we use the model setting of a three-stage IT-driven service supply chain and discuss different factors influencing the capacity optimization problem. With a discrete-event simulation we then evaluate a representative factor quantitatively. Thus, we provide deeper insights about the usefulness of excess <b>capacity</b> <b>markets</b> for <b>capacity</b> optimization in different settings and scenarios. The results serve {{as a guide for}} practitioners, build the basis for further quantitative evaluation and represent a starting point for empirical validation...|$|R
40|$|For {{ensuring}} electricity {{security of}} supply in the long run, liberalised electric systems regulators have to worry, {{not only about the}} presence of enough installed capacity, but also about the generation mix. Hence, indicative planning {{must be taken into account}} as well, for limiting dependence upon non-indigenous fuels, for instance. This can, simultaneously, help in meeting growing environmental constraints: renewables promotion is a clear example. There exist several mechanisms for addressing the adequacy problem (having enough megawatts) and for promoting renewables (having the good megawatts). In this study, a brief review of these mechanisms is done, and some are chosen for assessing their efficacy and efficiency over a system similar to the Spanish one, concretely capacity payments and <b>capacity</b> <b>markets</b> for the first problem and renewable energy premiums for the second. A simulation study is performed, which confirms the better characteristics of <b>capacity</b> <b>markets</b> in stabilising reserve margins, but whose effects may be damaged by an inadequate renewables promotion policy. info:eu-repo/semantics/draf...|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of electricity markets {{has raised the}} fundamental {{question as to whether}} markets provide the right incentives for the provision of the reserves needed to maintain system reliability, or whether some form of regulation is needed. In some states in the US, electricity retailers have been made responsible for providing such reserves by contracting capacity in excess of their forecasted peak demand. The so- called Installed <b>Capacity</b> <b>Markets</b> (ICAP) provide one means for contracting reserves, and are the subject of this paper. In particular, for given productive and transmission capacities, we identify ¯rms' opportunity costs of committing resources in the capac- ity market, and hence, the costs of inducing full capacity commitment. Regulatory issues such as the optimal choice of the reserve margin and the capacity de¯ciency rate (which serves as a price-cap) are analyzed. From a welfare view-point, we also com- pare the desirability of providing reserves either through <b>capacity</b> <b>markets</b> or through the demand side (i. e. voluntary curtailments) ...|$|R

40|$|Rising feed-in from {{renewable}} energy sources decreases margins, load factors, and thereby profitability of conventional generation in several electricity markets around the world. At the same time, conventional generation is still needed to ensure security of electricity supply. Therefore, capacity markets are currently being widely discussed as a measure to ensure generation adequacy in markets such as France, Germany, and the United States (e. g., Texas), or even implemented for example in Great Britain. We assess the effect of different <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> design options in three scenarios: 1) no <b>capacity</b> <b>market,</b> 2) a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> for new capacity only, and 3) a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> for new and existing capacity. We compare the results along the three key dimensions of electricity policy ��� affordability, reliability, and sustainability. In a Great Britain case study we find that a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> increases generation adequacy since it provides incentives for new generation investments. Furthermore, our results show that a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> can lower the total bill of generation because it can reduce lost load and the potential to exercise market power. Additionally, we find that a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> for new capacity only is cheaper than a <b>capacity</b> <b>market</b> for new and existing capacity because it remunerates fewer generators {{in the first years}} after its introduction. {{renewable energy}} source...|$|E
