40|$|It {{is shown}} that, under certain circumstances, a {{pressure}} wave of large amplitude which propagates in a fluid, inside a deformable viscoelastic tube initially inflated or <b>collapsed,</b> <b>can</b> present the behaviour {{of a shock}} wave. The characteristic time and length of formation for such a shock like wave can be computed from the method of characteristics if the dynamic rheological law of the tube is known. The principal feature of such a shock wave propagation inside an initially collapsed tube {{is the presence of}} wavelets on the wave front. The dispersion relation of such wavelets, experimentally obtained from the wall displacements measurements, has been theoretically interpreted on the basis of dynamical effects dominated by the longitudinal tension of the tube...|$|E
40|$|How easy {{is it to}} {{suppress}} shake, rattle and roll in a long bridge or a skyscraper? Most practical structures are designed so that long wave resonance vibrations can be avoided. However, there are recent examples, such as the Millennium Bridge in London or the Volga Bridge in Volgograd, which show that unexpected external forces may result in large scale unwanted shake and rattle. Full scale alteration of a bridge (or a skyscraper) would not be considered as an acceptable option, unless the structure has <b>collapsed.</b> <b>Can</b> we fix this by examining a representative part of the structure only and making small lightweight changes? We will do it here and illustrate an idea linking the engineering analysis to elastic waveguides. Comment: 19 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|Splice losses {{between a}} {{photonic}} crystal fiber (PCF) {{and a single}} mode fiber (SMF) or a PCF are numerically investigated by using finite element method (FEM) with the circular perfectly matched layer (PML). Results show that the splice loss between a SMF and a PCF with air holes completely <b>collapsed</b> <b>can</b> reach many times of that between a SMF and a PCF without air-hole collapse. We calculate the rotation losses between two identical PCFs of three kinds: large mode area, polarization maintaining and grapefruit. It is shown that for the large mode area PCF and the grapefruit PCF, the rotation losses {{are sensitive to the}} wavelength when the rotation angle is larger than zero degree. The non-circular mode field distribution is the main source of the rotation loss. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|According to The Zombie Survival Guide, “extensive {{research}} {{has yet to}} find an isolated example of Solanum [the virus which causes its victims to become zombies] in nature. Water, air, and soil in all ecosystems, {{from all parts of}} the world, have turned up negative, as have their accompanying flora and fauna” (ZSG 2 - 3). There is no evidence, then, that Nature was directly responsible for “the creatures that almost caused our extinction” (World War Z 1). Nevertheless, apart from the facile assertion that everything that happens in the material world may be subsumed beneath the umbrella term ‘nature’, even a cursory meditation on the significance of the Zombie War cannot fail to point an accusatory finger at the Earth, at Gaia, at Pacha Mama, however you wish to name her. The massive decline in human population, as well as the inevitable concomitant drop in consumption as the fabric of society <b>collapsed,</b> <b>can</b> only have brought relief to an endangered global ecosystem. But perhaps of greatest interest is the metaphorical significance of the zombies. They have an uncanny “ability to hunt, fight, and feed in total darkness” (ZSG 7). Their intelligence “ranks somewhere beneath that of an insect” (ZSG 14), they have “no language skills” (ZSG 16), while it is “instinct brought on by Solanum [which] drives the undead to kill and devour” (ZSG 18). These are the attributes — both strengths and weaknesses — that humanity habitually bestows on the natural world.

As a consequence, Bohmian trajectories evolve classically.

40|$|Abstract. A similar type of nonlocal {{nonlinear}} Schrödinger (NLS) system {{arises in}} both water waves and nonlinear optics. The nonlocality {{is due to}} a coupling between the first harmonic and a mean term. These systems are termed nonlinear Schrödinger with mean or NLSM systems. They were first derived in water waves by Benney-Roskes and later by Davey-Stewartson. Subsequently similar equations were derived and found to be fundamental systems in quadratically nonlinear optical media. Wave <b>collapse</b> <b>can</b> occur in these systems. The collapse structure {{and the role of the}} ground state in the collapse process are studied. There are similarities to the well-known collapse mechanism associated with classical NLS system. Numerical simulations show that NLSM collapse occurs with a quasi self-similar profile that is a modulation of the corresponding ground-state. Further, it is found that NLSM <b>collapse</b> <b>can</b> be arrested by adding small nonlinear saturation. ...|$|R
40|$|Catastrophic {{and sudden}} collapses of {{ecosystems}} are sometimes preceded by early warning signals that potentially {{could be used}} to predict and prevent a forthcoming catastrophe. Universality of these early warning signals has been proposed, but no formal proof has been provided. Here, we show that in relatively simple ecological models the most commonly used early warning signals for a catastrophic <b>collapse</b> <b>can</b> be silent. We underpin the mathematical reason for this phenomenon, which involves the direction of the eigenvectors of the system. Our results demonstrate that claims on the universality of early warning signals are not correct, and that catastrophic <b>collapses</b> <b>can</b> occur without prior warning. In order to correctly predict a collapse and determine whether early warning signals precede the collapse, detailed knowledge of the mathematical structure of the approaching bifurcation is necessary. Unfortunately, such knowledge is often only obtained after the collapse has already occurred...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of neutrinos from massive stellar <b>collapses</b> <b>can</b> teach {{us a great}} deal not only about source objects but also about microphysics working deep inside them. In this study we discuss quantitatively the possibility to extract information on the properties of dense and hot hadronic matter from neutrino signals coming out of black-hole-forming collapses of nonrotational massive stars. Based on our detailed numerical simulations we evaluate the event numbers for SuperKamiokande, with neutrino oscillations fully taken into account. We demonstrate that the event numbers from a Galactic event are large enough not only to detect but also to distinguish one hadronic equation of state from another by our statistical method, assuming the same progenitor model and nonrotation. This means that the massive stellar <b>collapse</b> <b>can</b> be a unique probe into hadron physics and will be a promising target of the nascent neutrino astronomy...|$|R
