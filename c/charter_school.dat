40|$|This {{research}} studied {{perceptions of}} public school superintendents in Michigan regarding <b>charter</b> <b>schools.</b> Superintendents in Genessee, Macomb, Oakland, Washtenaw, and Wayne Counties comprising 111 school districts, completed a two-part survey about <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> that was developed by Ogden (1995) and modified for the current study. The survey consisted of 5 sections that measured perceptions in the following areas of charter schools: personal reactions to <b>charter</b> <b>schools,</b> intentions of <b>charter</b> <b>schools,</b> responsiveness of <b>charter</b> <b>schools,</b> effects of <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> on public education, and funding issues involving <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> and a short demographic survey. Superintendents were provided the opportunity to comment in three areas: accountability of <b>charter</b> <b>schools,</b> protections for students and parents in <b>charter</b> <b>schools,</b> and general observations. The largest group of superintendents agreed that <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> {{were part of the}} future of public education, but were very skeptical about the ability of <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> to provide better educational outcomes for students. They also agreed that the intent of <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> was to increase student success, but not in the vocational area. Superintendents were quite negative regarding the idea that <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> were a response to the business community 2 ̆ 7 s demand for change in education. Finally, superintendents were very concerned that <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> were impacting negatively on public school funding. Their negativity in this area was supported by their voluntary responses in the comments section of the survey. Significant findings were indicated on several items in sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the survey when compared to Ogden 2 ̆ 7 s study. Mean scores on two sections of the survey, responsiveness of <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> and effects of <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> on public education were significantly below the mean, indicating that superintendents generally disagreed with the statements in these sections. In the sections on personal reactions to <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> and funding issues involving <b>charter</b> <b>schools,</b> were significantly above the mean, indicating the superintendents were in agreement in regards to these areas of <b>charter</b> <b>schools.</b> The superintendents 2 ̆ 7 mean scores on the fifth subscale, intentions of <b>charter</b> <b>schools,</b> did not differ from the neutral point...|$|R

The study's purpose was to report preliminary findings to the Legislative Analyst's Office relating to the educational performance, characteristics, and practices of <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> and their sponsoring agencies. The study addressed six central questions: (1) What reform strategies and assumptions drive <b>charter</b> <b>schools?</b> (2) What are the characteristics of <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> in California?

40|$|<b>Charter</b> <b>schools</b> are {{receiving}} more attention in Arkansas {{and across the}} nation, {{as the number of}} these public schools of choice in Arkansas fluctuates each year. Some charters have been closed, while new ones have been opened. Further, in many media outlets, <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> are often lumped together as one entity. However, ‘charter school’ is not a blanket term. They are separate schools run under separate charter documents with different operators.

40|$|<b>Charter</b> schools—public <b>schools</b> {{that are}} exempt {{from many of the}} {{procedural}} regulations that apply to regular public schools—are a widespread but poorly-studied form of education reform. With nearly 2, 700 <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> now educating more than 684, 000 children nationwide, policymakers and parents need to know how the education <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> provide compares to that provided by regular public schools. Assessing the academic performance of <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> is difficult, because many <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> are tar-geted toward specific populations such as at-risk students, disabled students, and juvenile delinquents. This makes it very challenging for researchers to draw a fair comparison—comparing targeted <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> to regular public schools is like comparing apples and zebras. As a result, there are very few reli-able research findings on the academic quality of <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> as compared to regular public schools. This is the first national empirical study of <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> that compares apples to apples—that is, test scores at <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> and regular public schools serving similar student populations. By comparing “untargeted” <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> serving the general population to their closest neighboring regular public schools, we can draw a fair comparison and get an accurate picture of how well <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> are performing. Measuring test score improvements in eleven states over a one-year period, this study finds that <b>charter</b> <b>schools</b> serving the general student population outperformed nearby regular public schools on math test...|$|R
