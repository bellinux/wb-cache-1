[...] In 2015, after the opening of the Palmetto Cafe, Willamette Week Robert Fernas called The Parish a leading destination for oysters and said that the restaurant was not negatively impacted by the split.|$|E
500|$|F.E.A.R.s horror {{theme was}} praised by critics. Game Informer claimed that [...] "...the {{frequent}} spooky head trips that Monolith has so skillfully woven together make {{an experience that}} demands to be played." [...] IGN opined that [...] "... the environment has been so well-crafted to keep you edgy and watchful ... playing the game {{for a few hours}} straight <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> draining." [...] GameSpot reacted similarly, calling F.E.A.R.s horror [...] "... exceedingly effective", and agreeing that it [...] "... can leave you a bit emotionally exhausted after a while." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the praise, some reviewers {{criticized the}} game for its {{confusing}} level layouts and felt they have not held up very well over the years. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer stated that Perfect Dark is [...] "not afraid to throw dead ends at you seemingly {{for the hell of}} it, or repeat textures so much in its huge maps that you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dizzy." [...] GameSpot's Tom Mc Shea noted that the campaign was [...] "oddly paced", and that [...] "locked doors, unused rooms, and dead ends... can be disheartening to stumble around in a circle until you finally happen upon the correct door you just couldn't locate." [...] Nevertheless, he admitted that [...] "it's {{a lot of fun to}} replay them to try for high scores and figure out the many unique objectives." [...] He also remarked that that online play can periodically suffer from a significant amount of lag, but praised the amount of content and features.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Scruggs {{was getting}} bored with {{repetition}} of the classic bluegrass fare. [...] By now, his sons were professional musicians, and he was caught up in their enthusiasm for more contemporary music. He said, [...] "I love bluegrass music, and still like to play it, but I do like to mix in some other music for my own personal satisfaction, because if I don't, I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bogged down and a little depressed". Scruggs also wanted to play concerts in venues that normally featured rock and roll acts. Columbia Records executives told Flatt and Scruggs that they intended to try a new producer, Bob Johnston, instead of their long-time producer Don Law. Johnston had produced Bob Dylan's records. This new association produced Changin' Times, Nashville Airplane, and The Story of Bonnie and Clyde albums. [...] Flatt was not happy with some of this material — he didn't like singing Bob Dylan songs and refused to perform them, saying [...] "I can't sing Bob Dylan stuff, I mean. Columbia has got Bob Dylan, why did they want me?". Even the success of the Bonnie and Clyde album was not enough to prevent their breakup in 1969. After the split, Flatt formed a traditional bluegrass group with Curly Seckler and Marty Stuart called The Nashville Grass, and Scruggs formed the Earl Scruggs Revue with his sons.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Associated Press, Knowles said that one of the hardest parts of the tour was [...] "squeezing a decade's worth of hits into a two-hour show" [...] and performing the songs in designer Thierry Mugler's [...] "elaborate" [...] costumes. She elaborated: [...] "I'm never gonna go onstage or do a video and not work until my feet are blistered, and until I'm basically, I can't walk any more. I always give, and I do that because I know how lucky I am, to do my job." [...] She also promised that the tour would be more emotional than The Beyoncé Experience because of the [...] "real raw and more sensitive" [...] nature of the I Am... portion of the double album. Knowles also expressed frustration that snippets of the show appeared online after the first shows on the opening leg, [...] "ruining" [...] some of the surprise of the concert experience and possibly convincing some fans not to attend. She went on saying: [...] "It's great because people <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sneak peek and say, 'Oh, I wanna come to the show,' or, 'I don't wanna go to that show'... and I'm fans of people so I go on there and check it out too. But you put so much of your heart and time into the wardrobe... it's kind of unfortunate that people can see the show months before you get into their city, but that's life." [...] French designer Thierry Mugler collaborated with Knowles on the wardrobe and had a creative advisor role, as he also contributed to designing the whole show, from lighting to choreography, production and directing three sequences for the concert. As a creative advisor, Mugler stated about the show: ...|$|E

50|$|Feeling Sexy is a 1999 Australian short feature from artist Davida Allen. Allen later {{described}} the film as:A lovely plum pudding story.

There's hope and, as a Catholic, I feel that there is hope and I want to tell stories that say there is hope. It's a love story unlike the Hollywood stories which say move on; it's not working here so move on. Feeling Sexy is not a kind of Bible story that says, 'Drat it, {{this is going to be}} hard work'. It's just a different angle at looking at a universal situation. It's a celebration of monogamy. It's very similar to a seed which, unless it's watered, dies.|$|R

For such a situation, to investigate the optimal dividend policy, a stochastic dynamic dividend model with nonzero terminal bankruptcy values is put forward in this paper.

An important application of this result {{is that it can}} be employed to construct the solution for the optimal value function on the dividend problem with bailouts at bankruptcy. Further, the relationship for the solutions of these two different problems is demonstrated. In the end, some numerical examples are provided to support our theoretical results and the corresponding economic interpretations are illustrated...|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom {{the series}} was often {{compared}} to Davies' Bleak House three years earlier. One reviewer for the Telegraph wrote that [...] "Some of the acting has been a bit too hammy" [...] and blamed falling viewing figures on [...] "confusion over scheduling, starting as an hour long special and then breaking into half an hour episodes, like a Victorian East Enders." [...] - another added that it [...] "doesn't seem to have caught on {{in the same way}} as other recent costume dramas such as Cranford and Bleak House", both due to scheduling and also down since [...] "it wasn't quite as good" [...] as these two programmes, though also that [...] "Most of the cast were as reliably terrific". The Independent also praised the performances, especially Courtney, Macfadyen and Peake, whilst another of its reviewers praised Davies' adaptation. The Guardian also praised the acting and the adaptation, though with the caveat that [...] "because it's Dickens, those top names <b>can</b> <b>get</b> away with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more showing off and look-at-me acting than they would be able to in, say, Jane Austen".|$|R
