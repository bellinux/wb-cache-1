GenSan also accounts for the second largest daily total catch of fish in the country after Navotas City in the National Capital Region. [...] Locals in the city boast that fishes and seafoods do not come fresher than what is found in their locality. [...] The fishing industry in GenSan yields a total daily capacity of 750 metric tons of fish catch alone and employs about 7,800 workers. [...] Which is why General Santos City is home to seven (7) tuna processing plants in the country. [...] The Fishport Complex in Barangay Tambler has a [...] quay and a [...] wharf for 2,000 GT reefer carriers. [...] The fishport is equipped with modern facilities that comply with international standards on fish <b>catch</b> <b>handling.</b>|$|E
40|$|This is a {{final report}} of the project DANTEQ (2010 - 2015). Through this project new {{competence}} and new methods for optimal handling of whitefish onboard with respect to raw material quality and energy efficiency have been developed. The project was divided into four research areas; (1) <b>catch</b> <b>handling,</b> (2) chilling and freezing, (3) energy systems and (4) modelling. The main results are given below: Short time live storage of fish befare killing: When towing times are short and catches are small a survival of 50 - 80 % was found for cod (density of fish in the storage tank varied from 120 to 550 kg/m 3). The fishing depth has influence on survival rate. The stress level of the fish was lower straight after catch than after storage in live holding tanks onboard (not always significant differences). Less blood was found in fillets from live stored fish and fish processed straight after catch compared to commercial processed fish. Electro stunning of fish: Voltage of 40 V DC is enough to achieve satisfactory immobilizing and easier handling of catch in connection with further processing (bleeding/gutting/heading) for cod, haddock and saithe. Three rows of electrodes on the stunner (current load for 4 - 6 seconds) is enough to achieve satisfactory immobilization. Electro stunning of saithe lead to broken backbone and bloodspots on 10 to 40 % of the fish. Freezing of cod: Pre-rigor cod frozen in a magnetic field ((ell Alive System) achieved minimal differences in quality compared to traditional tunnel freezing and freezing in a cold room, in spite of different freezing rates. The mechanism for freezing of fish in magnetic field appeared {{to be similar to}} that of traditional freezing methods. Chilling of cod and haddock: Fish stored in slurry had a different microstructure and different water distribution, measured by low field NMR, than those stored in flake ice. Differences in colour and QIM­score were found for haddock stored under the two conditions. Logging of operational data: Software for acquisition and storage of operational data has been developed. Systems for acquisition and storage of operational data, as well as transfer of the data to an on-shore server, have been installed on-board two trawlers. Software for efficient analysis of operational data has been developed and used to generate operational profiles. Model development: Methods and models for simulating <b>catch</b> <b>handling</b> processes have been developed, along with proof-of-concept software that demonstrates their practical use. Discrete event simulation seems to be a very suitable method for 5 imulating and evaluating fish processing lines, though more work needs to be done with regards to model quality and validation. Acquiring high-quality data about <b>catch</b> <b>handling</b> processes for modelling purposes is difficult and labour-intensive. Future experiments should be designed to focus more on individual processes and less on the whole line, and should aim to keep better track of the "human factors" that add noise and affect the outcome...|$|E
40|$|The {{post-harvest fish loss}} in Indonesia is {{relatively}} high or about 30 percent. Even Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) states that the post-harvest fish loss in Indonesia reaches up to 30 percent per year. This study aims to analyze quality loss of capture fisheries in the Gulf of Tomini region-Indonesia. This research used a survey method through direct observation to the fish caught by fishermen. In order to assess the fish loss, organoleptic testing based on the supply chain was done, the sample is four fish. Organoleptic characteristics observation was done through providing an assessment based on the parameter of SNI 01 - 2346 - 2006. The result shows {{that there is a}} quality loss of capture fisheries in the Gulf of Tomini region after the fish on the fishing boats (9. 0) and landed at the fish port (7. 8), fish terminal (6. 8), and fish market (5. 0).

40|$|One {{challenge}} of the implementation of observer programs is the difficulty of ensuring an adequate statistical coverage of whole fleets, and this may hamper {{the usefulness of the}} data for management purposes. These constraints make it necessary to find alternative cost-effective methods. Electronic monitoring (EM) systems are being used in some fisheries as an alternative, or a complement to human observers. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} test the use and reliability of EM on a tropical tuna purse seiner in the Atlantic Ocean. To achieve this objective 61 free and FAD sets of a tuna purse seiner were closely monitored to compare information provided by EM and onboard observers to determine if EM can reliably document fishing effort, set-type, tuna catch, and bycatch. Set-type was correctly identified using EM for 60 of the 61 sets. Total tuna catch per set was not significantly different between EM and observer data sets; however, species composition did not match for all the species between EM and observers. Overall, bycatch species were underestimated by EM, but large bodied species such as billfishes were well documented. The analyses in this study showed that EM can be used to determine the fishing effort (number of sets), set-type, and total tuna catch as reliably as observers can. In order to be fully comparable with observer data, improvements for accurately estimating the bycatch will need to be developed in the EM system. Operational aspects that need to be improved for an EM program to be implemented include standardising installation and onboard <b>catch</b> <b>handling</b> methodology, as well as improvements in video technology deployment...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of the landing {{obligation}} under the European Common Fisheries Policy, electronic monitoring (EM) is often presented as one of the solutions to fully document catches. EM includes video monitoring to record the <b>catch</b> <b>handling</b> process on board the vessels. This study evaluated the efficacy of EM for cod (Gadus morhua) catches on vessels in a mixed bottom-trawl fishery and tested the hypothesis that cod catches are difficult to detect with video monitoring, specifically in catches with large volumes of bycatch. In 2011, a catch quota pilot study started for cod in the Dutch bottom-trawl fishery in which EM was used as an audit system to review the consistency of reported cod catches. Eleven vessels joined the pilot study on a voluntary basis. Participants received a 30 % increase in individual quota for cod and were compensated with extra effort in days at sea. In return, all cod catches were counted against their cod quota. This mixed bottom-trawl fishery differs from fisheries where EM was proven to be a successful method, e. g. hook and line or single-species fisheries with low bycatch volumes. We conclude that distinguishing small numbers of cod in catches of mixed bottom-trawl fisheries is difficult because there is a low correlation between logbook and video data (Pearson r = 0. 17). We expect similar difficulty in other mixed demersal trawl fisheries with large bycatch volumes, when similar-looking species are targeted. Meanwhile, implementing a landing obligation will pose large challenges for fisheries with large volumes of bycatch. Limitations in the applicability of EM to control {{one of the most common}} types of fisheries in Europe will be a burden on the implementation of the European landing obligation. Improved protocols and technical adaptations may reduce some of the limitations encountered in this study...|$|E

This makes it necessary to find cost-effective alternatives. Electronic monitoring (EM) systems are being used in some fisheries as an alternative or a complement to human observers. The objective {{of this study was to}} test the use and reliability of EM on the tropical tuna purse-seine fishery. To achieve this objective, seven trips of tuna purse seiners operating in the three Oceans were closely monitored to compare the information provided by EM and on-board observers to determine if EM can reliably document fishing effort, set type, tuna catch, and bycatch. Total tuna catch per set was not significantly different between EM and observer datasets; however, regarding species composition, only main species matched between EM and observers. Success on set-type identification using EM varied between 98. 3 and 56. 3 %, depending on the camera placement. Overall, bycatch species were underestimated by EM, but large bodied species, such as billfishes, were well documented. The analyses in this study showed that EM can be used to determine the fishing effort (number of sets) and total tuna catch as reliably as observers can. Set-type identification also had very promising results, but indicated that refinement of the methods is still needed. To be fully comparable with observer data, improvements for accurately estimating the bycatch will need to be developed in the application and use of the EM system.

In this study, factors which may {{affect the quality of}} noninvasive samples of Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) in the subtropical areas were identified. We collected hair and faecal samples from captive Asiatic black bears and quantitatively evaluated the effects of hair age (from fresh to 60 days), faeces age (from fresh to 14 days), faeces sampling locations (i. e. sample collected from either the surface, inside or a mixture of both the surface and inside of faeces), and faeces preservation methods (frozen or kept at room temperature in 95 % ethanol) on amplification success rates of mitochondrial DNA fragments of different sizes (450 bp, 900 bp, and 1600 bp). The results showed that the amplification success rates decreased with sample age and amplicon size in both hair and faecal DNA. In subtropical environment, {{there was no significant difference}} between amplification success of DNA extracted from fresh and 7 -day-old samples of either the hair or faeces. The amplification success rates were not influenced by sampling location of faeces. For faeces preserved in 95 % ethanol, the amplification success appeared unaffected by frozen at - 20 °C or kept at room temperature in shorter mtDNA fragments, but was significantly influenced when amplicon size was 1600 bp. The results of this study will reinforce the optimization of noninvasive sampling approaches in Asiatic black bear research, especially in the subtropics...|$|R

The Points Box, {{as it was called}} locally, contained a 36-lever frame signal box was built by Dutton & Co., of Worcester, and supplied to the railway when the yard was further modified and the workshops were extended. The frame is a unique survivor of the 'drink-handle' type in which the handle of the lever also serves as the <b>catch</b> <b>handle.</b> The 'box features a set of characteristic wooden external steps that must be climbed to access the levers, with storage space beneath the timber-built top section, this would have housed all the linkage and control gear. The top section also features a three-quarter glazed section and integral fireplace, and bears a considerable resemblance to Dutton's signal boxes constructed for the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) about this time. From there the signalman on duty could command a view of the entire yard, controlling every traffic movement from passenger trains to complex shunting procedures. The one thing the signalman did not control was the staff and ticket single line safe-working, which in accordance with earlier practice remained the responsibility of the stationmaster. Douglas signal box lacked both telegraph and telephone when it was constructed, and it was not provided with a telephone until 1925 following an overrun accident in August of that year. Train to and from Peel and Castletown, and for shunting movements within the station were indicated to the signalman by a comprehensive whistle code.|$|R

40|$|Fault {{tolerance}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} challenges for future technology scaling to tolerate transient faults. Various techniques at design level are available to <b>catch</b> and <b>handle</b> transient faults, e. g., Triple Modular Redundancy. An important but missing step is to verify the implementation of those techniques since the implementation might be buggy itself. The thesis is focusing on formally verifying digital circuits with respect to fault-tolerant aspects. It considers transient faults and basically checks whether these faults can influence the output behavior of sequential circuits for any kind of scenarios. As a result the designer is pin-pointed directly to critical parts of the design and gets a prove about the absence of faulty behavior for non-critical parts. The focus of the verification is completeness with respect to the analysis. Three issues need to be adequately addressed: 1) cover all input stimuli, 2) all possible transient faults, and, 3) all possibly exponential long (wrt. to number of state bits) propagation paths. All three issues are addressed in different engines. A tool called RobuCheck has been implemented and evaluated on different academic benchmarks from ITC' 99 and industrial benchmarks from IBM...|$|R
40|$|Fish {{preservation}} in Senegal: potential use of {{lactic acid}} bacteria and their antibacterial metabolites. In Senegal, fish are first as staple animal protein foods for populations. Socioeconomic constraints hamper the development of industrial preservations.

Some strategies of seafood products preservation using {{lactic acid bacteria}} producing bacteriocin are not very expensive and do not consume energy very much. They can be adapted in the preservation of fish in Senegal particularly in the fermentation in which the <b>catches,</b> generally <b>handled</b> for many hours at ambient temperature, are only added salt (NaCl) and sun dried. Lactic acid bacteria producing bacteriocins {{could be used as}} starters (with addition of carbohydrates) during the preparation of fish for rendering them more resistant to the growth of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria by in situ production of organic acids and bacteriocins. A second alternative of application of these bacteria is to use bactericidal solutions obtained from their cultures as additional barrier to sodium chloride to prevent growth of the flora during fish storage for maturation.

In this study we compare the growth, development, and predatory activity of two species of spiders that were fed on live and dead prey. Pardosa astrigera (Lycosidae) and Hylyphantes graminicola (Lyniphiidae) were fed live or dead fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster. The survival of P. astrigera and H. graminicola was not affected by prey type. The duration of late instars of P. astrigera fed dead prey were longer and mature spiders had less protein content than those fed live prey, whereas {{there were no differences}} in the rate of H. graminicola development, but the mass of mature spiders fed dead prey was greater than those fed live prey. Predation rates by P. astrigera did not differ between the two prey types, but H. graminicola had a higher rate of predation on dead than alive prey, presumably because the dead flies were easier to <b>catch</b> and <b>handle.</b> Overall, the growth, development and reproduction of H. graminicola reared with dead flies was better than those reared on live flies, yet for the larger P. astrigera, dead prey may suit smaller instars but mature spiders may be best maintained with live prey.

40|$|Background: The US {{commercial}} fishing industry is hazardous, {{as measured by}} mortality data. However, research on non-fatal injuries is limited. Non-fatal injuries constitute the majority of occupational injuries and can result in workers’ lowered productivity and wages, lost quality of life, and disability. In the United States, a Work Process Classification System (WPCS) has previously been applied in Alaskan freezer-trawl and freezer-longline fleets to identify causes of injuries and specific hazards, but not to other fishing fleets. Objectives: This descriptive epidemiologic study aimed to explore the application and modification of the WPCS in multiple Alaskan fleets, characterize non-fatal occupational injuries in these fleets, and identify work processes that could be targeted for further investigation and future injury prevention efforts. Design: Traumatic, non-fatal injuries on-board Alaskan {{commercial fishing}} vessels were identified through United States Coast Guard investigative reports. Characteristics of injuries, as well as worker characteristics, were analysed. Injuries were coded using the WPCS. Results: We successfully utilized the WPCS to code non-fatal injury cases (n = 136).

He appeared in 58 games with the Class D Appleton Foxes in 1962, and played his final games in 1964, when made two appearances for the Class A Aberdeen Pheasants of the Northern League.|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{operating}} systems (RTOSes) {{are required to}} run for years, and never fail, without human intervention. Safety is the primary concern for RTOSes because they usually control physical equipment. One strand of real-time operating system (RTOS) research {{is looking at the}} question: can developing an RTOS in a safe language result in a system that an errant process can’t crash? Choosing a good programming language can significantly improve the safety of the RTOS. In this thesis, we examine the advantages and associated problems of writing RTOSes in a safe language, namely Java. We design an RTOS named JARTOS that schedules processes on a micro-controller called TINI. The code of the JARTOS system is mainly written in Java, since Java provides both static and dynamic safety. The Java compiler handles potentially unsafe operations rather than the programmer. Also, Java includes run-time support to <b>catch</b> and <b>handle</b> run-time errors. JARTOS is designed to be a time-sharing system, where cooperative multiprocessing is used to schedule real-time processes. JARTOS switches processes on a timer interrupt. Each process is required to execute quickly and then give up the processor. Otherwise it will be timed out. To implement a timeout, JARTOS supports a timer interrupt that regularly updates a clock and checks for timeouts. To keep the number of interrupts to a minimum, input/output is done using polling where possible. Also, interrupts code is designed to be transparent to the processes. An interrupt handler sets flags and values, and then returns to the process it interrupted. In the context of achieving real-time performance, we look at the issues of implementing our system design in Java. We introduce how we used Java constructs to implement the design of JARTOS, and how we solved the low-level issues. RTOSes have to guarantee that real-time processes execute within specified time dead-lines. Loss of synchronization can occur when deadlines are not met. Timing problems are often very difficult to find. In JARTOS, we designed a set of performance measurements to investigate timing problems. These performance measurements are carefully designed to provide the right information at minimal cost in performance. Performance of TINI and JARTOS are measured and discussed...|$|R

The published article can be found at: [URL] access the supplementary material for this article, please see Supplementary files under ‘Article Tools’ at: [URL] The US commercial fishing industry is hazardous, as measured by mortality data. However, research on non-fatal injuries is limited. Non-fatal injuries constitute the majority of occupational injuries and can result in workers' lowered productivity and wages, lost quality of life, and disability. In the United States, a Work Process Classification System (WPCS) has previously been applied in Alaskan freezer-trawl and freezer-longline fleets to identify causes of injuries and specific hazards, but not to other fishing fleets. Objectives. This descriptive epidemiologic study aimed to explore the application and modification of the WPCS in multiple Alaskan fleets, characterize non-fatal occupational injuries in these fleets, and identify work processes that could be targeted for further investigation and future injury prevention efforts. Design. Traumatic, non-fatal injuries on-board Alaskan commercial fishing vessels were identified through United States Coast Guard investigative reports. Characteristics of injuries, as well as worker characteristics, were analysed. Injuries were coded using the WPCS. Results. We successfully utilized the WPCS to code non-fatal injury cases (n = 136). The most frequent main work processes associated with non-fatal injuries included: on-board trawlers, handling frozen fish and processing the catch; on-board vessels using pot/trap gear, handling the gear and shooting/setting the gear; on-board longliners, traffic on board and hauling the gear; and on-board processor vessels, processing the catch, other work with the <b>catch,</b> and <b>handling</b> frozen fish. Conclusions. The study confirmed that a WPCS can be applied to multiple Alaskan fleets to identify hazardous tasks. Hazards were unique for each vessel gear type. Future injury prevention efforts should target work processes associated with the most frequent and most severe injuries. Future studies should establish time estimates for work processes in order to determine risk estimates. Efforts to improve non-fatal injury reporting, especially on smaller commercial fishing vessels, should be undertaken...|$|R
40|$|Drawing valid {{inferences about}} parent populations is {{directly}} {{dependent upon the}} precision or reliability of estimated parameters. Self-evident as this statement is, however, situations frequently arise wherein unwarranted conclusions may be drawn from sample information whose reliability is imperfectly known. Thus {{it is clear that}} wherever possible, estimates of any sort should be supplemented with some measure of their precision. This implies, of course, that assumptions underlying any application of modern sampling theory have been reasonably satisfied. The present paper represents an attempt to assess estimates that permit delineating the absolute age structure of fish catches, assuming the appropriate attributes are observed in a manner that at least approximates probability sampling. Such procedure further provides a basis for modifying sampling designs so future estimates derived therefrom will possess some a priori degree of precision imposed in accordance with available manpower and monetary resources. Although specifically concerned with determining age composition of California landings of king salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum), the techniques discussed herein could be applied to other species whose <b>catches</b> are <b>handled</b> in similar fashion. Moreover, they would be appropriate where dealing with any of several attributes commonly descriptive of fish populations. Besides the number of scale annuli, constituting the attribute of interest in the present paper, these include: (1) characteristics defining each kind of fish subject to capture; or, perhaps, for a given kind of fish, characteristics that would identify a member of a particular subpopulation, aggregations of which may comprise a commonly fished stock; (2) any artificially applied "mark"; (3) a particular class of lengths or weights; and, (4) sex. Designed to provide a basis for predicting year-to-year king salmon yield potential, the parent study from which part of my data were selected evolved during the recovery phase of a large-scale salmon marking program. In addition to sampling the California commercial salmon landings for marked fish, it was necessary to sample concurrently for other attributes. During the program's early stages, it was further decided that still others capable of yielding potentially valuable information, viz., length and age, could be sampled incidentally with little added effort and expense. To supplement those secured from the above source, I have used additional data collected during a concomitant study of the ocean sport salmon catch at various points to help develop the methods discussed...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} {{in the scientific community}} that animals suffer from both physical and emotional stress. Emotional stress has been linked to an increase in core body temperature and decrease in surface area temperature of at least 0. 5 degrees Celsius in a wide number of species, a phenomenon known as Stress-Induced hyperthermia (SIH) (Edgar et al, 2013). <b>Catching</b> and <b>handling</b> are relevant events in an animals life. Wild prey animal’s experience catching and handling by predators while animals raised for productivity experience catching and handling by Humans. Handling has been linked to the onset of stress-induced hyperthermia in many species, and Edgar et al (2013) provided evidence that handling causes a significant decrease in Head, Eye and Comb temperatures in Hens. The aim of this current research was to replicate that of Edgar et al (2013). This research aims to use infrared thermography to measure changes in Chooks Head, Eye and Comb prior to, during and after capture and handling. It is the hope that this research will provide further evidence that handling causes stress-induced hyperthermia in Hens. Infrared thermal imaging is a non-invasive measure of surface temperatures. It is the hope that this research will provide evidence that infrared thermography is an effective non-invasive measure useful in animal welfare research. 13 Hens and 6 Roosters Head, Eye and Comb temperatures were measured using infrared thermal imaging during 20 minute pre measurement, handling (capture by a researcher and held for 5 seconds) and 20 minute post measurement periods. Average surface area temperatures for each of the 19 subjects were obtained every minute during pre-measurement, handling and post-measurement. Average temperatures were plotted and analysed to investigate any patterns of change. Subjects Head, Eye and Comb temperatures experienced a significant decrease (more than 2 degrees celsius) from pre-measurement to handling. For Hens the Comb saw the most significant temperature drop during handling which is consistent with previous research. The Head saw the most significant decrease in temperature during handling for Roosters. Roosters Head Eye and Comb temperatures in post measurement went on to exceed those obtained in pre measurement while for Female subjects Head, Eye and Comb temperatures never returned to pre-measurement levels during the 20 minute post measurement. Infrared thermography proved a useful and accurate measure of Chooks surface area temperature. A surface area temperature decrease of more than 2 degrees celsius was observed in all subjects. All subjects met the requirements for stress-induced hyperthermia after handling. Stress-induced hyperthermia had a significant and lengthy impact on Chooks, in particular Hen...|$|R

The project will occupy approximately 25 net acres ofsurface area located within the Kapoho Section ofthe Kilauea Lower East Rift Geothermal Resource Subzone. Each drilling site will be engineered to support the drilling equipment and to keep drilling effluent contained on site and separate from any natural drainage. Each wellpad will have drilling mud pits, sumps with gently sloped walls used to temporarily store drilling wastes which typically consist of rock cuttings, waste drilling mud, cement particles, lost-circulation material and other drilling mud additives, and other waste drilling liquids. The high porosity of the volcanic soils and rock in the site area results in rapid downward percolation of rainwater. Berms will be provided to contain possible spills in areas where chemicals are <b>handled.</b> <b>Catch</b> basins, culverts, ditches, and berms will be provided for drainage control. In accordance with the requirements of the Department of Health NSP, geothermal emissions will be vented through an approved abatement device during well/pipeline cleanouts. Noise will be generated during well drilling, construction, and operational phases of the project. However, the sites have been located in agricultural areas away from urban population concentrations. The sites will also be located to take advantage of existing topography and vegetation to muffle or block noise from the drilling operations. ...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary This {{document}} {{is the second}} deliverable in work package 5 of the DiscardLess project. The project is intended {{to contribute to a}} successful implementation of the landing obligation of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy of the EU. The work package 5 addresses how unwanted, unavoidable <b>catches</b> can be <b>handled</b> on-board the fishing vessels i. e. from catch to first sale. The objective of this deliverable is to identify available alternatives and recommend the most applicable solutions for on-board handling of these unwanted, unavoidable catches for four different fleet segments in three case studies. The case studies are North Sea, Bay of Biscay and Northeast Atlantic (Iceland and UK), but the selection of vessels has taken into consideration transferability to other European fleets and areas. Practical and cost efficient solutions are identified, adapted and developed for four different fleet segments based on input from different tasks in the project (1. 4, 5. 1, 6. 1 & 6. 2) and stakeholder interaction. The fleet segments selected are 10 - 15 meter hook & line coastal vessels typically operated in Northeast Atlantic, 18 - 30 meter Danish seine/bottom trawl vessels typically operated in the North Sea and adjacent areas, 34 - 44 meter Bay of Biscay bottom trawlers typically operated by the Spanish fleet and finally 40 - 60 meter fresh-fish bottom trawlers used by most EU offshore fleets. Solutions for sorting, bleeding, cleaning, chilling, pre-processing, storing and other on-board handling are suggested and evaluated based on need, cost and applicability. Some parts of the work include elements of technological innovation, but most rely on exploiting currently available solutions, applying “best practice” technology and knowledge. Recommended solutions are presented on deck-plans (drawings) in order for stakeholders to get a clearer picture of the suggested changes. The work presented in this report focuses on the four previously mentioned fleet types that provide a relatively good cross-section of important EU fleets that are to be heavily affected by the landing obligation. It includes reviewing current setup of on-board handling where discarding is allowed and then identifies solutions applicable for those fleet types under a discard ban. The main challenges are connected to catches of juvenile fish, which cannot be utilised for direct human consumption. A number of alternatives are identified for each fleet segment and the most applicable solutions are discussed and demonstrated in detail e. g. in deck-plans, mas-balance calculations, cost/benefit assessment etc...|$|R
