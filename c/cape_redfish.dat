50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>redfish</b> {{is found}} in {{subtropical}} waters in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean on the coasts of South Africa, Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island. Another population {{is present in the}} southeastern Pacific Ocean off the coast of Chile. The depth range for this species is 20 to 275 m.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>redfish</b> {{feeds on}} small benthic invertebrates. It is a {{viviparous}} species, retaining the eggs internally until they hatch. In the fiords of southern Chile, the young larvae occupy the channels where copepod eggs are plentiful while larger larvae move onto shelf {{areas where the}} salinity is higher and larger copepod prey is more abundant.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>redfish</b> is a {{demersal}} fish that grows {{to a maximum}} length of about 37 cm though a more normal size is about 30 cm. The dorsal fin has about thirteen spines and thirteen soft rays and the anal fin has three spines and six soft rays. The general colour of this fish is reddish or brown, and there are five or six pale spots on its back.|$|E
5000|$|The false {{jacopever}} or <b>Cape</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes capensis) is a marine fish {{belonging to the}} family Sebastidae. [...] Found only in waters off the western coast of South Africa, Tristan da Cunha and southern South America, S. capensis lives in depths of 20 to 275 m. It reaches up to 37 cm in length, and is reddish or brownish with 5-6 pale spots on {{the upper part of}} the body. It has extremely prominent eyes. It mainly feeds on mysids.|$|E
40|$|During May and June 1972 several surveys {{for fish}} larvae {{were carried out}} in {{northern}} Norwegian coastal waters. No larvae of herring was found. In May and June cod larvae were observed in a greater abundance than in the two previous years along the coast from Troms to North <b>Cape.</b> <b>Redfish</b> larvae were found in May and June in an abundance comparable to that in 1971. Capelin larvae were abundant in May and June from Torsv√•g to the North Cape area with the highest concentrations in the northernmost part of the area surveyed. The vertical distribution and the length distribution of the capelin larvae indicate a spawning time as in 1971. The spawning grounds were not situated {{as far south as}} in previous years...|$|E
