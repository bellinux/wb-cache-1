6000|$|Matters {{between us}} took this turn:- On {{the day of}} my {{separation}} from my uncle, and even before the arrival at our counting-house of my trunks (which he sent after me, NOT <b>carriage</b> <b>paid),</b> I went down to our room of business, on our little wharf, overlooking the river; and there I told John Spatter what had happened. John did not say, in reply, that rich old relatives were palpable facts, and that love and sentiment were moonshine and fiction. He addressed me thus: ...|$|E

25|$|The Great Depression {{wiped out}} the Conrad family's fortune, {{just as it had}} those of so many others. In 1942, the family lost their manor home in Philadelphia, and then moved into a small <b>carriage</b> house, <b>paid</b> for by Frances's brother, Egerton Vinson. Eventually, Charles Sr., broken down by {{financial}} failures, left his family.|$|R
60|$|As I left Dullborough in {{the days}} when there were no railroads in the land, I left it in a stage-coach. Through all the years that have since passed, have I ever lost the smell of the damp straw in which I was packed--like game--and forwarded, <b>carriage</b> <b>paid,</b> to the Cross Keys, Wood-street, Cheapside, London? There was no other inside passenger, and I {{consumed}} my sandwiches in solitude and dreariness, and it rained hard all the way, and I thought life sloppier than I had expected to find it.|$|E
60|$|It is time I {{should explain}} the {{otherwise}} inexplicable enclosure. Will you tell Fields, with my love (I suppose he hasn't used all the pens yet?), that I {{think there is}} in Tremont Street a set of my books, sent out by Chapman, not arrived when I departed. Such set of the immortal works of our illustrious, etc., is designed for the gentleman to whom the enclosure is addressed. If T., F. and Co., will kindly forward the set (<b>carriage</b> <b>paid)</b> with the enclosure to ----'s address, I will invoke new blessings on their heads, and will get Dolby's little daughter to mention them nightly.|$|E
6000|$|I {{transmitted}} {{to you by}} Mr. B---- a copy of my [...] "Conciones ad Populum", and of an Address against the Bills (meaning [...] "The Plot Discovered"). I have taken the liberty of enclosing ten of each, <b>carriage</b> <b>paid,</b> which you may perhaps have an opportunity of disposing of for me;--if not, give them away. The one is an eighteen-penny affair;--the other ninepence. I have likewise enclosed the Numbers which have been hitherto published of [...] "The Watchman";--some of the Poetry may perhaps be serviceable to you in your paper. That sonnet on the rejection of Mr. Wilberforce's Bill in your Chronicle the week before last was written by Southey, author of [...] "Joan of Arc", {{a year and a}} half ago, and sent to me per letter;-how it appeared with the late signature, let the plagiarist answer.... I have sent a copy of my Poems--(they were not yet published):--will you send them to Lunn and Deighton, and ask of them whether they would choose to have their names on the title page as publishers; and would you permit me to have yours? Robinson and, I believe, Cadell, will be the London publishers. Be so kind as to send an immediate answer.|$|E
25|$|Cambridge's {{strength}} and hearing {{began to fade}} in his later years. He was unable to ride at Queen Victoria's funeral and had to attend in a <b>carriage.</b> He <b>paid</b> his last visit to Germany in August 1903. He died of a haemorrhage of the stomach in 1904 at Gloucester House, Piccadilly, London. His remains were buried five days later next to those of his wife in Kensal Green Cemetery, London.|$|R

5000|$|Nathaniel Colby homesteaded 160 {{acres in}} South Cheyenne Canyon, {{including}} Seven Falls in December 1872. He sold the land rights {{nine months later}} for $1,000 (...) to the Colorado Springs Land Company. Fearing logging operations would ruin the scenic area, in 1882, naturalist James Hull purchased the property. The trail to Inspiration Point was launched in 1883. By 1885, he owned 400 acres in the canyon. Hull built a stairway {{to the top of}} the falls and built a road through the canyon. Customers came by horses, burros, and <b>carriages</b> and <b>paid</b> a toll to enter Seven Falls. It then became a tourist attraction.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} week there came a letter from Aunt Stanbury to Dorothy. It began by saying that Dolly had left behind her certain small {{properties}} which had now been made up in a parcel and sent by the railway, <b>carriage</b> <b>paid.</b> [...] "But they weren't mine at all," [...] said Dolly, alluding to certain books in which she had taken delight. [...] "She means to give them to you," [...] said Priscilla, [...] "and I think you must take them." [...] "And the shawl is no more mine than it is yours, though I wore it two or three times in the winter." [...] Priscilla was of opinion that the shawl must be taken also. Then the letter spoke of the writer's health, and at last fell into such a strain of confidential gossip that Mrs. Stanbury, when she read it, could not understand that there had been a quarrel. [...] "Martha says that she saw Camilla French in the street to-day, such a guy in her new finery as never was seen before except on May-day." [...] Then in the postscript Dorothy was enjoined to answer this letter quickly. [...] "None of your short scraps, my dear," [...] said Aunt Stanbury.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have had}} great fun over a clock that an unknown admirer sent papa last Thursday. It {{arrived in a}} wooden box from London, <b>carriage</b> <b>paid,</b> and papa feels {{it must have been}} sent by some one who had read his {{remarkable}} sermon, 'Is Licence Liberty?' for {{on the top of the}} clock was a figure of a woman, with what papa said was the cap of Liberty on her head. I didn't think it very becoming myself, but papa said it was historical, so I suppose it is all right. Parker unpacked it, and papa put it on the mantelpiece in the library, and we were all sitting there on Friday morning, when just as the clock struck twelve, we heard a whirring noise, a little puff of smoke came from the pedestal of the figure, and the goddess of Liberty fell off, and broke her nose on the fender! Maria was quite alarmed, but it looked so ridiculous, that James and I went off into fits of laughter, and even papa was amused. When we examined it, we found it was a sort of alarum clock, and that, if you set it to a particular hour, and put some gunpowder and a cap under a little hammer, it went off whenever you wanted. Papa said it must not remain in the library, as it made a noise, so Reggie carried it away to the schoolroom, and does nothing but have small explosions all day long. Do you think Arthur would like one for a wedding present? I suppose they are quite fashionable in London. Papa says they should do a great deal of good, as they show that Liberty can't last, but must fall down. Papa says Liberty was invented at the time of the French Revolution. How awful it seems! ...|$|E

5000|$|Noggin was a commercial-free service, but it {{did show}} interstitials between shows such as episodes from the short film series Oobi and Connie the Cows Milk Break, {{as well as other}} [...] "tie-in" [...] media such as music videos that tied in with {{promotions}} for programs on the other Nickelodeon channels. Much of the channels revenue came primarily from <b>carriage</b> fees <b>paid</b> by pay television providers. With the rebrand, Noggin introduced its second mascot named Feetface; its introduction brought about one of the first examples of a new animation style called [...] "photo-puppetry", in which an animation is created by the use of manipulation of photographs.|$|R
6000|$|This {{the boys}} did. They sauntered {{along with a}} {{careless}} air, concealing the desire they had to engage a carriage, until at last they came to one which Rollo thought would do. The instant the boys stopped before this carriage, the coachman jumped down from his box, and began to open the carriage door for them, {{and at the same}} time all the other coachmen in the line began cracking their whips, and calling out to the boys again to come and take their <b>carriages.</b> Rollo <b>paid</b> no attention to them, but addressed the coachman of the carriage which he had selected, and said in French, [...] "To Pompeii." ...|$|R

30|$|Company E is an {{industrial}} {{systems and equipment}} manufacturer with a diverse product range, from industrial power systems and robotics to low voltage products and automated process systems. Globally, the company is present in 100 countries, has 300 manufacturing locations, 150, 000 employees and a turnover of approximately 40 billion €. In Sweden, the company employs 9000 people in 30 different locations. As such, the company has multifaceted supply chains with both complex inbound and outbound flows for MTS and MTO. It is estimated that, based on volume, MTS dominates, whereas measured in value, MTO is the dominating strategy. Considering palletised goods, the ratio of inbound to outbound volume is 60 / 40. Local manufacturing sites predominantly serve local markets, which makes the inbound flows of interest for this case study. However, the product range is so diverse that any one characterisation of the flows {{is bound to be}} inaccurate in some sense. The company controls and optimises its own flows by purchasing A to B transports. Supply is delivered according to Incoterms EXW (Ex Works) and FOB, and deliveries using DAP and CPT (<b>Carriage</b> <b>Paid</b> To). The logistics organisation does not influence the supply strategy and acts as an internal supplier of transport, given the demand derived from the manufacturing and purchasing functions. One of the objectives of the logistics organisation is to increase the level of central control over the physical flows to and from the many sites at different geographical locations. The centralised control and coordination aims to increase the efficiency of the physical flow of goods within the company’s supply and distribution networks.|$|E
30|$|Company F is an {{industrial}} materials and tools manufacturer {{with expertise in}} materials technology {{and a range of}} products, including industrial tooling equipment for mining, machining solutions to advanced materials, and construction equipment. The company is organised in five business divisions. Globally, the company employs 47, 500 and has an annual turnover of 9.25 billion €. The company identifies its strategic strength as a technology leader in the premium segment of its sector—a segment characterised by high entry barriers. The division included in this case study is the materials technology division, which employs around 7000 people in Sweden. It produces advanced steel materials for further manufacturing by its customers and has an annual turnover of 1.5 billion €. The significant flows in the case are movement back and forth between offshore production sites and final distribution to customers. A common supply chain starts with products made in Sweden, which are shipped to their own production sites in China, then back to Sweden for final adaptation before being shipped out to the final customer. In the case of a final customer in China, the products in various manufacturing stages are shipped between continents several times, which obviously amplifies the impact of transport lead time. Deviation in lead time can also impact the levelling of production in production facilities in cases of MTO products. About 30 % of the orders can be delivered directly from stock, whereas 70 % are MTO. The transport services are purchased via a forwarder with regular allotments that are booked in advanced and modified if necessary. The Incoterm CPT (<b>Carriage</b> <b>Paid</b> To) is used. The company aims to control the flow from origin to destination, meaning that one way or another, the liner shipping leg of any transport always falls within the purview of the company. The transport lead time is {{a significant portion of the}} total lead time, which means that, especially for the MTO segment, its impact on the customers’ lead time is substantial. The annual volumes for the relevant flows are about 6000 TEUs.|$|E
5000|$|Wedgwood {{hoped to}} monopolize the aristocratic market, and thus win for his wares a special distinction, a social cachet which would filter to all classes of society. Wedgwood fully {{realized}} {{the value of}} such a lead and {{made the most of}} it by giving his pottery the name of its patron; Queensware, Royal Pattern, Russian pattern, Bedford, Oxford and Chetwynd vases for instance. Whether they owned the original or merely possessed a Wedgwood copy mattered little to Wedgwood's customers. In 1773 they published the first Ornamental Catalogue, an illustrated catalogue of shapes. A plaque, in Wedgwood's blue pottery style, marking the site of his London showrooms between 1774 and 1795 in Wedgwood Mews, is located at 12, Greek Street, London, W1. In 1773, Catherine the Great of Imperial Russia ordered the Green Frog Service from Wedgwood, consisting of 952 pieces and over a thousand original paintings. Most of the painting was carried out in Wedgwood's decorating studio at Chelsea. Its display, Wedgwood thought, 'would bring an immence (sic) number of People of Fashion into our Rooms. For over a month the fashionable world thronged the rooms and blocked the streets with their <b>carriages.</b> (Catharine <b>paid</b> ₤ 2,700. It can still be seen in the Hermitage Museum.) Strictly uneconomical in themselves, the advertising value of these productions were huge.|$|R
