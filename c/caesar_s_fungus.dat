40|$|Sverris Saga and the {{classical}} martial influences This thesis investigates the influences that classical Latin works had upon the martial depictions in Sverris saga. The {{works of the}} Latin authors; Sallust, Lucan and Julius Caesar are investigated and shown how these works affect {{the way that the}} characters of King Sverrir and his contemporise are depicted in the saga. These influences or topoi include pre and post-battle speeches, depictions of individual bravery and military tactics as constantly depicted in the saga. 	The investigation starts with a detailed look at the stated classical sources, seemingly available to the compiler/author of Sverris saga. The Icelandic translation of the works of Sallust and Lucan, the Rómverja saga is investigated closely. The provenance and date of the original Latin version of the manuscript used in the translation of the Rómverja saga is suggested. The hypothesis, which is based on that of Þorbörg Helgasdóttir, is that the original manuscript came from western Germany. The suggested provenance of the manuscript from a Benedictine monastery in western Germany suggests a closer connection to the Benedictine monasteries of northern Iceland. The eldest surviving manuscript of the Rómverja saga has also been linked to the hand of a scribe known by the survival of his works in the northern Icelandic Benedictine houses. 	The provenance of a Latin manuscript containing all five of <b>Caesar</b> <b>s</b> Commentaries that could have been copied and brought to Iceland is also shown. This manuscript is from the same period and location that Þorbörg Helgasdóttir maintained, that the Sallust manuscript originated from, Trier in western Germany. <b>Caesar</b> <b>s</b> Commentaries as a source for topoi on the martial aspects of Sverris saga is also briefly examined. The state of Sverris saga and the description of the surviving manuscripts are than detailed. 	The majority of the thesis is concentrated upon showing how the influences or topoi from Sallust, Lucan and Caesar affected the representation of the martial aspects of the warriors in Sverris saga. This influence is shown by extensive comparisons between passages from Sallust and Caesar Commentaries with those contained in Sverris saga. The many passages and topoi that seem to come originate from these classical sources that are present in Sverris saga, seem to suggest an extensive knowledge of these works by the compiler/author of the saga. The presentation of this extensive evidence on classical martial influences upon Sverris saga is displayed {{in a way that is}} clear and concise and hopefully this will provoke further discussion on the saga...|$|R

30|$|In this study, two {{endophytic}} <b>fungi</b> (<b>S</b> 1 and S 3) sampled {{from wild}} D. officinale formed in vitro mycorrhizal associations with host roots, thereby markedly enhancing seedling growth.

Although we investigated carbon utilization of the green orchid in experimental conditions, further investigations should focus on the effects of symbiotic fungi on carbon nutrient acquisition of the adult D. officinale under field conditions. Moreover, the mechanism for increased photosynthesis capacity and polysaccharides accumulation via mycorrhizal associations should be explored in a more comprehensive way.|$|R
40|$|Fungi are a {{large and}} diverse group of organisms. Some fungi, like mushrooms, are edible and {{considered}} crops. Others, however, can cause serious diseases of crop and forest plants, and those diseases can have negative effects on local and international economies {{as well as on}} the supply of food and other materials that agriculture provides. The Agricultural Research Service maintains a unique resource—the U. <b>S.</b> National <b>Fungus</b> Collections—for helpful and detailed information about fungi. Accurate knowledge of fungi is critical for controlling the diseases they cause. North America’s Largest Fungarium In 1869, the Smithsonian Institution transferred its fungal collection to the U. S. Department of Agriculture. It later became the Mycological Collections and finally the U. <b>S.</b> National <b>Fungus</b> Collections. “The collection had fewer than 3, 000 specimens in 1885. It has grown to more than 1 million collected specimens and is the largest fungarium in North America today,” says Amy Rossman, research leader of the Systematic Mycology and Microbiology Laboratory (SMML) in Beltsville, Maryland. “It is important that this long-standing resource be available because species and science are not static, and you can never go back in time and space. Many fungal species can be lost either through competition or habitat loss, so having this collection will become increasingly important. ” When producers are faced with a fungus problem in their crops, the U. <b>S.</b> National <b>Fungus</b> Collections, its curator, and the scientists who work most directly with the collection are often the first contacts made. SMML biologist Shannon Dominick serves as the collection manager, receiving, cataloging, maintaining, and providing samples of fungi. “When this collection was started more than 100 years ago, no one had an inkling of how DNA worked or its scientific importance,” says Dominick. “Now, DNA is extracted to definitively identify fungal species that may be new or those that have been sitting in the collection for years. It is imperative that this collection be available for future scientific technologies that may help agricultural scientists and producers maintain health of a crop. ...|$|R

40|$|Task-switching {{enables a}} system to make its own {{decisions}} about which task to perform. It is therefore a key ability for any truly autonomous system. Common task-switching methods range from computationally expensive planning methods to often suboptimal, minimalistic, heuristics. This thesis takes a bio-inspired approach, motivated {{by the fact that}} animals successfully make task-switching decisions on a daily basis. The field of behavioural ecology provides a vast literature on animal task-switching. Generally these works are descriptive models of animal behaviour, either modelling to fit the data from observed animal behaviour, or theoretically optimal models of how animals ought to behave. But what is needed in robotics are methods that generate behaviour based on the information available (due to sensing) to the robot. Furthermore these methods have to take the physical limitations (velocity, acceleration, storage capacity etc.) of the robot into account. This thesis takes inspiration from descriptive behavioural ecology models and proposes a situated and embodied task-switching method suitable for mobile robots. To evaluate the quality of the decisions an objective function is needed. Reproductive success is commonly used in Biology, here economical success is used. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed methods on Toda 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Fungus</b> Eater robot. The decisions this robot faces are (1) when to work and when to refuel and (2) where to work or refuel respectively. Both decision types are essential to any autonomous, mobile robot.

These results suggested that the green orchids could receive more C nutrition from the substrate due to symbiotic fungi, and photosynthesis capacity of the green D. officinale could be enhanced by the <b>S</b> 3 <b>fungus,</b> therefore carbon nutrition acquisition also increased.
