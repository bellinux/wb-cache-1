25|$|A {{nuclear reactor}} {{is only part}} of the {{life-cycle}} for nuclear power. The process starts with mining (see Uranium mining). Uranium mines are underground, open-pit, or in-situ leach mines. In any case, the uranium ore is extracted, usually converted into a stable and compact form such as yellowcake, and then transported to a processing facility. Here, the yellowcake is converted to uranium hexafluoride, which is then enriched using various techniques. At this point, the enriched uranium, containing more than the natural 0.7% U-235, is used to make rods of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor that the fuel is destined for. The fuel rods will spend about 3 operational cycles (typically 6 years total now) inside the reactor, generally until about 3% of their uranium has been fissioned, then they will be moved to a spent fuel pool where the short lived isotopes generated by fission can decay away. After about 5 years in a spent fuel pool the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle,</b> and it can be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed.|$|E

50|$|The sugar {{has been}} cooked, and the now-liquid sugar is poured onto a {{silicone}} rubber mat (e.g., Silpat). Any coloring is now added. The sugar is then folded repeatedly into itself, until the sugar is, while still flexible, <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle.</b> The sugar is then stretched {{out and then}} folded on itself repeatedly. This process incorporates air into the sugar, and gives it a bright lustery sheen. The sugar can then be sculpted by hand into various shapes, made into ribbons, or blown.|$|E
50|$|To {{produce a}} {{miniature}} gourmet look-alike, first choose the pre-dyed clay in the desired colour. Use your palms {{to soften the}} clay and roll the clay to the desired shape. Cook the clay in the oven, let the clay cool down in the oven until it is <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be <b>handled</b> again. After it is cooled, take the razor blade and shave off a tiny pile of white powder from chalk. Spray or paint a layer of Varathane sealer. While the sealer is still wet, pick {{up some of the}} white chalk powder with your finger tip and dab it sparingly onto a few areas of the clay. The general shape of the model is thereby finished. Lastly, one may utilize different paints and colouring tools to finish the process.|$|R

50|$|When a coronal cloud occurs, it {{can take}} several days for the plasma <b>to</b> grow <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> detach from the sun. This usually happens before the coronal mass {{ejection}} is able <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> for the magnetism to dissipate, {{at which point the}} solar flare cycle begins again. While the gas cloud is still <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be in a semi-liquid plasma state, it clings tightly to the mass ejection, insulating it from the cold temperature of extra-solar space.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the syrup}} blend reaches the target temperature, the candy maker removes {{it from the}} heat source and may add citric acid, food dye, and some flavouring, such as a plant extract, {{essential}} oil, or flavorant. The syrup concoction, which is now very thick, can be poured into a mold or tray to cool. When the syrup is <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle,</b> it can be folded, rolled, or molded into the shapes desired. After the boiled syrup cools, it is called hard candy, since it becomes stiff and brittle as it approaches room temperature.|$|E
5000|$|The {{glutinous rice}} is soaked and cooked with coconut milk and salt. The filling {{is made of}} {{shredded}} chicken breast, chicken stock, garlic, candle nut, ground coriander, cumin, brown sugar, vegetable oil, minced shallot, coconut milk, kaffir lime leaves, salt and pepper. Other than chicken, shredded fish or abon (beef meat floss) might be used as filling. When the cooked glutinous rice is <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle,</b> the chicken filling {{is placed on the}} glutinous rice and rolled in a banana leaf, wrapped and secured with biting or lidi semat, a small wooden [...] "needle" [...] made of coconut leaf mid rib or bamboo. Then these banana leaf packages are steamed or grilled. This releases a distinct pleasant aroma of toasted banana leaf.|$|E
