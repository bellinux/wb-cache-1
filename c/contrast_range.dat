50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{so-called}} brightness and contrast adjustment controls on televisions and monitors are traditionally {{used to control}} {{different aspects of the}} picture display.

50|$|As stated above, {{the image}} {{processor}} evaluates {{the color and}} brightness data of a given pixel, compares them with the data from neighboring pixels and then uses a demosaicing algorithm to produce an appropriate colour and brightness value for the pixel. The image processor also assesses the whole picture to guess at the correct distribution of contrast. By adjusting the gamma value (heightening or lowering the <b>contrast</b> <b>range</b> of an image's mid-tones) subtle tonal gradations, such as in human skin or {{the blue of the}} sky, become much more realistic.|$|E

These adjustments are typically performed on [...] "blown-out" [...] highlights, and [...] "crushed" [...] or [...] "muddy" [...] shadow areas, where clipping has occurred; or on desaturated colors.

50|$|This {{aspect is}} {{problematic}} {{in the case}} of backlights used for LCD TV displays.

However, CCFLs are strictly limited in {{the degree to which they}} can be dimmed, both because a lower plasma current will lower the temperature of the cathode, causing erratic operation, and because running the cathode at too low a temperature drastically shortens the life of the lamps.

50|$|Digital {{photograph}} restoration uses {{a variety}} of image editing techniques to remove visible damage and aging effects from digital copies of physical photographs. Raster graphics editors (see list below) are typically used to repair {{the appearance of the}} digital images and add to the digital copy of the photo where pieces of the physical photograph are torn or missing. Evidence of dirt, scratches, and other signs of photographic age are removed from the digital image manually, by painting over them meticulously. Unwanted color casts are removed and the image's contrast or sharpening may be altered in an attempt to restore some of the <b>contrast</b> <b>range</b> or detail that is believed to be in the original physical image. In addition image processing techniques such as image enhancement and image restoration are also applicable for the purpose of digital photograph restoration.|$|E
50|$|Before {{creating}} a digital negative {{it is important}} to know the process to which it will be applied. Since contemporary inks and printers cannot cover a gamut as wide as traditional silver negatives and it is imperative that each process have its own tonal curve to apply to a photograph so that the photographer can take full advantage of its gamut. Also, different processes react to colors in different ways; sometimes photographers print out a monochromatic negative in a specific color to get a specific <b>contrast</b> <b>range.</b> For example, some use purple inks and low contrast curves for the small gamut of cyanotype printing, while the platinum/palladium process necessitates a high contrast curve that works best with green ink. Before the color cast is added, however, {{it is important to}} remember to invert the image to ensure that the negative prints a positive if contact printing (some also flip their image horizontally since the final print will be a mirror image of the negative), or sometimes it may be left as a positive (in the case of a positive image on a dry or wet plate).|$|E

40|$|The most {{commonly}} used method to tune the colour transition states of an ECD is to modify the chemical structure of the electrochromic polymers to achieve the desired transparent to dark state switching colours.
