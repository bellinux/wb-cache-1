5|$|The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the sport's {{governing}} body, {{refused a}} compromise proposal from Michelin {{to allow a}} chicane to be installed, maintaining that such rule changes would be grossly unfair to the Bridgestone-shod teams, who had come prepared with properly working tyres, and that a last-minute change to the track layout would be dangerous in case of crashes. The Michelin teams, unable {{to come to a}} compromise with the FIA, decided not to participate.

5|$|An initial trial {{concluded}} on 23 May 2008 when Mr Justice David Steel {{issued a}} summary judgment after hearing that both Total and Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL) had agreed that negligence was the cause. In the main trial, Total UK {{claimed that the}} duty supervisor {{at the time was}} responsible for the explosion, but refused to admit either civil or <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> for the incident. Total UK argued that it should not be liable for damages because it could not reasonably have foreseen that it would cause the destruction it did. On 20 March 2009 the High Court found Total liable for the blast, saying that it was satisfied that Total had control of tank filling operations at the Buncefield depot. The judgement left the company facing damage claims of around £700million.|$|E

5000|$|With its implementation, Miriam Defensor-Santiago {{considers}} RA 3327 as {{an initial}} step to decriminalize {{certain forms of}} libel. As {{a response to a}} number of suggested amendments to the former Cybercrime Prevention Act which seeks to pin down criminal activities on the internet, the bill was crafted to protect online users' freedom of expression contrary to RA 10175 which, according to legislators and non-government organizations, restraints online rights and sends a [...] "chilling effect" [...] to consumers of new media. While the bill does not exempt libelous statements made online from <b>criminal</b> <b>liabilities,</b> it exempts public airing of grievances from being held liable. [...] Statements of dissatisfaction directed to public officials, consumer products, and online remarks meant for private and peer reviews are not subject to <b>criminal</b> <b>liabilities,</b> as well as statements of protests that concern public interest. Under the proposed bill, satire will be protected, and truth will be considered as a defense against libel.|$|R

25|$|In {{the common}} law of England and Wales there is no <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> for failing {{to act in the}} event of another person being in danger; however, there are {{exceptions}} to this rule. In instances where there has been an assumption of responsibility by the bystander, a dangerous situation was created by them, or there is a contractual or statutory duty to act, <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> would be imposed on the bystander for their failure to take action. The courts are reluctant to penalize people attempting rescue and English law makes provision for the actions of 'good Samaritans,' unless their actions were grossly negligent or made a situation worse.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there are}} also notable {{differences}} between the Sedition Act and the MRHA. The first relates to the consequences of violation. Under section 4 of the Sedition Act, an offender is criminally liable. In contrast, under the MRHA, {{the imposition of a}} restraining order does not per se carry <b>criminal</b> <b>liability.</b> It is only when this restraining order has been breached that <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> will attach to the offender. This difference reflects the varying approach towards disruption of public order – the punitive approach of the Sedition Act contrasts with the pre-emptive approach of the MRHA. Such an arrangement allows the Government to mount a calibrated response against perpetrators. If the Sedition Act was the only relevant statute in operation, it might result in disproportionately harsh action being taken against minor public order disturbances.|$|E
50|$|Even when self-defense is justified, {{there can}} be serious civil or <b>criminal</b> <b>liabilities</b> related to self-defense when a {{concealed}} carry permit holder brandishes or fires his/her weapon. For example, if innocent bystanders are hurt or killed, there could be both civil and <b>criminal</b> <b>liabilities</b> even if the use of deadly force was completely justified. Some states technically allow an assailant who is shot by a gun owner to bring civil action. In some states, liability is present when a resident brandishes the weapon, threatens use, or exacerbates a volatile situation, or when the resident is carrying while intoxicated. It {{is important to note}} that simply pointing a firearm at any person constitutes felony assault with a deadly weapon unless circumstances validate a demonstration of force. A majority of states who allow concealed carry, however, forbid suits being brought in such cases, either by barring lawsuits for damages resulting from a criminal act on the part of the plaintiff, or by granting the gun owner immunity from such a civil suit if it is found that he or she was justified in shooting.|$|R
50|$|Massey Energy {{owned and}} {{operated}} Upper Big Branch Mine where 29 miners were killed in April 2010. The Mine Safety and Health Administration found that the company's culture of favoring production over safety contributed to flagrant safety violations that caused the coal dust explosion. It assessed $10.8 million in fines for 369 citations and orders, the largest for any mine disaster in U.S. history. Alpha Natural Resources additionally settled Massey's potential <b>criminal</b> <b>liabilities</b> for $209 million.|$|R
40|$|The law {{has long}} {{recognized}} a presumption against <b>criminal</b> strict <b>liability.</b> This Note situates that presumption {{in terms of}} moral intuitions {{about the role of}} intention and the unique nature of criminal punishment. Two sources-recent laws from state legislatures and recent advances in moral philosophy-pose distinct challenges to the presumption against strict liability crimes. This Note offers a solution to the philosophical problem that informs how courts could address the legislative problem. First, it argues that the purported problem from philosophy stems from a mistaken relationship drawn between criminal law and morality. Second, it outlines a slightly more nuanced moral framework that both accommodates recent thinking in philosophy and preserves the correspondence between moral theory and criminal law that underwrites the presumption against <b>criminal</b> strict <b>liability.</b> Finally, it considers how the contours of this moral framework could inform judicial efforts to accommodate and constrain new <b>criminal</b> strict <b>liability</b> laws...|$|R
25|$|I see no {{rational}} {{ground for}} excluding from conduct capable of {{giving rise to}} <b>criminal</b> <b>liability,</b> conduct which consists of failing to take measures that lie within one's power to counteract a danger that one has oneself created, if {{at the time of}} such conduct one's state of mind is such as constitutes a necessary ingredient of the offence.|$|E
25|$|A literal {{reading of}} the above {{provision}} shows clearly {{that the purpose of}} section 298A is to preserve public tranquility, and only to criminalize acts that incite racial and religious disharmony. This seems extremely similar to the objective of the MRHA. The only significant difference is that a violation of section 298A results in the commission of a criminal offence, while <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> attaches under the MRHA only when a restraining order has been breached.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, the United States has {{not been}} {{receptive}} {{to the idea that}} a dog, itself, can be criminally liable. A California court explained that, although the tendency to anthropomorphize animals is understandable, especially with beloved pets like dogs, the law does not recognize dogs as having the mental state that can incur <b>criminal</b> <b>liability.</b> That is, although dogs and other animals may have the capacity to commit vicious and violent acts, they do not possess the legal ability to commit crimes.|$|E

25|$|The Military Commissions Act of 2006 {{does not}} apply by its terms to José Padilla, since he is a U.S. citizen. Other {{provisions}} of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 may provide civil and criminal amnesty to those involved in his case, who might otherwise face civil rights lawsuits or <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> for unlawfully detaining someone. The immunity provisions may be tested in a civil suit brought by Padilla against John Yoo of the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice (discussed below).|$|E
25|$|Where an {{individual}} is contracted to perform certain duties, a {{failure to do so}} may result in <b>criminal</b> <b>liability.</b> The principle of liability arising from a mutual agreement arose from the decision of R v Instan, where a woman was found guilty of manslaughter, after failing to summon medical attention for her aunt, who maintained them both. The decisions of the court suggest that an implied contract of mutual benefit existed, so as to imply a duty upon the defendant to act. As demonstrated by 'R v Pittwood (1902), where a gatekeeper was found criminally liable for failing to perform his duties correctly, this principle may be extended to instances where the injured individual is a third party.|$|E
25|$|Liability for {{omissions}} {{has long}} existed where a pre-existing duty {{can be established}} between two parties. For example, where an individual accidentally creates a small fire in a flat, he is under a duty to take reasonable steps to extinguish it, or to summon help. A special duty also exists between parents and their children, and an omission of a parent to save their young child from drowning would result in <b>criminal</b> <b>liability,</b> as it is deemed a parent voluntarily undertakes to ensure the wellbeing of their child. Other duties may be inferred from contractual obligations, and so an individual employed to ensure individuals do not cross a railway line while there are trains running would be found criminally negligent where he abandoned his post.|$|E

The first step in understanding civil and <b>criminal</b> <b>liabilities</b> one may have to confront is to know and fully understand what self-defense really means.

25|$|With {{respect to}} the failure to pay U.S. federal income tax, some tax protesters miss the {{distinction}} between civil and <b>criminal</b> <b>liability.</b> A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial for non-payment of income tax does not relieve a defendant of civil liability (i.e., the legal obligation to pay the tax). After a criminal acquittal, the IRS can continue to seek money through levy or other lawful means. Generally, {{the amount of money}} due to the IRS is determined administratively by the IRS, and not in a criminal trial. (The amount of tax may, however, be calculated after the guilty verdict is reached in a criminal case—for purposes of determining the severity of the sentence.) Although there have been several well-publicized cases of acquittal in a criminal tax case, the IRS continues collection efforts, with many defendants finally seeking refuge in bankruptcy court.|$|E
25|$|Commercial sex work {{is illegal}} in China; hence, brothels are illegal and {{commercial}} sex workers operate out of places of entertainment (e.g., karaoke bars), hotels, hair-dressing salons, {{or on the}} street. The traditional strategy for controlling HIV transmission through commercial sex workers has been the development of stricter laws to prevent risky behaviors, accompanied by raids on suspected sex establishments by public security officials. Those apprehended are subject to compulsory education on law and morality, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, and forced participation in productive labor. Under the Frontier Health and Quarantine Law, those knowingly infected with HIV who continue to practice prostitution are subject to more severe penalties and <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> for creating a risk of spreading a quarantinable disease. Detention ranges from 6 months to 2 years. Until recently, health education in this system was uncommon.|$|E
25|$|The Sedition Act plays {{its part}} by criminalizing the doing of any act or the uttering of any words having a seditious tendency, and {{dealings}} with seditious publications. The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act ("MRHA") is {{another piece of}} this legislative jigsaw. It was introduced to ensure that adherents of different religious groups exercise tolerance and moderation, and to keep religion out of politics. Minister for Home Affairs S. Jayakumar stated that the MRHA takes a pre-emptive approach and can be invoked in a restrained manner to enable prompt and effective action. In contrast with the punitive approach of the Sedition Act where a breach of the statute carries <b>criminal</b> <b>liability,</b> under the MRHA restraining orders may be imposed upon people causing feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different religious groups, among other things. Criminal sanctions only apply if such orders are contravened.|$|E
