From a starting node, the walker goes through every and all the nodes and their children. In each step of changing position from node to the next node, three parameters are calculated: probability, residual error, and moving massage. This iteration will happen until the walker reaches some certain threshold. At that point, several calculations are made to estimate the PPR value. However, as the number of nodes in the graph gets bigger, the queries will demand more resources, such as the space needed to do the calculation for every node in the graph.
