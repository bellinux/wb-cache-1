40|$|We {{consider}} a biopolymer bundle consisting of filaments that are <b>crosslinked</b> together. The <b>crosslinks</b> are reversible: they can dynamically bind and unbind adjacent filament pairs as {{controlled by a}} binding enthalpy. The bundle is subjected to a bending deformation and the corresponding distribution of <b>crosslinks</b> is measured. For a bundle consisting of two filaments, upon increasing the bending amplitude, a first-order transition is observed. The transition is from a state where the filaments are tightly coupled by many bound <b>crosslinks,</b> {{to a state of}} nearly independent filaments with only a few bound <b>crosslinks.</b> For a bundle consisting of more than two filaments, a series of first-order transitions is observed. The transitions are connected with the formation of an interface between regions of low and high <b>crosslink</b> densities. Combining umbrella sampling Monte Carlo simulations with analytical calculations, we present a detailed picture of how the competition between <b>crosslink</b> shearing and filament stretching drives the transitions. We also find that, when the <b>crosslinks</b> become soft, collective behavior is not observed: the <b>crosslinks</b> then unbind one after the other leading to a smooth decrease of the average <b>crosslink</b> density.

25|$|Irradiation <b>crosslinking</b> (PE-Xc): The <b>crosslinking</b> of {{polyethylene}} is {{also possible}} by a downstream radiation source (usually a electron accelerator, occasionally a isotopic radiator). PE products are crosslinked below the crystalline melting point by splitting off hydrogen atoms. β-radiation possesses a penetration depth of 10 mm, ɣ-radiation 100mm. Thereby the interior or specific areas can be excluded from the <b>crosslinking.</b> However, due to high capital and operating costs radiation <b>crosslinking</b> plays only a minor role compared with the peroxide <b>crosslinking.</b> In contrast to peroxide <b>crosslinking,</b> the process is {{carried out in the}} solid state. Thereby, the cross-linking takes place primarily in the amorphous regions, while the crystallinity remains largely intact.|$|E

25|$|The {{properties}} of a polyurethane are {{greatly influenced by}} the types of isocyanates and polyols used to make it. Long, flexible segments, contributed by the polyol, give soft, elastic polymer. High amounts of <b>crosslinking</b> give tough or rigid polymers. Long chains and low <b>crosslinking</b> give a polymer that is very stretchy, short chains with lots of crosslinks produce a hard polymer while long chains and intermediate <b>crosslinking</b> give a polymer useful for making foam. The <b>crosslinking</b> present in polyurethanes means that the polymer consists of a three-dimensional network and molecular weight is very high. In some respects a piece of polyurethane {{can be regarded as}} one giant molecule. One consequence of this is that typical polyurethanes do not soften or melt when they are heated; they are thermosetting polymers. The choices available for the isocyanates and polyols, in addition to other additives and processing conditions allow polyurethanes to have the very wide range of properties that make them such widely used polymers.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} {{our recent}} work on linear viscoelasticity, large deformation behaviour and fracture properties of self-recovery dual <b>crosslink</b> gels having covalent and reversible <b>crosslinks.</b> The breakage of transient <b>crosslinks</b> dissipates strain energy and enhances the fracture toughness and extensibility of the gels. We have developed model "dual cross-link" gels, having permanent and reversible <b>crosslinks</b> simultaneously. The PVA dual <b>crosslink</b> gels are good model systems to investigate quantitatively {{the relationship between}} the breaking/healing dynamics of the breakable <b>crosslinks</b> and the macroscopic mechanical properties because they have a well-defined life time of the reversible bonds observed by linear rheology. We have performed various strain history tensile measurements, such as stress relaxation, continuous loading, and loading/unloading tests, to separate the effect of the breaking and healing of the reversible <b>crosslinks</b> on macroscopic stress. Also we have developed a physical model for the stress-strain relation and determined the breaking/healing time of the physical <b>crosslinks...</b>|$|R

Each vulcanization system results in a specific <b>crosslink</b> concentration and sulfur-rank distribution: mono-, di- and polysulfidic of nature. Tensile properties, tear strength and compression set of the vulcanized materials turn out to practically only depend on overall <b>crosslink</b> density, as resulting from the particular curing systems and vulcanization times. All trends in properties coincide when plotted {{as a function of}} the overall <b>crosslink</b> density. Surprisingly, the <b>crosslink</b> distribution: the ratios of mono- to di- and polysulfidic <b>crosslinks,</b> has only a minor effect on these properties.

Thus, in this paper, a bio-based <b>crosslink</b> agent (GACA) for UV curable coatings was synthesized from gallic acid and its chemical structure was confirmed by FT IR, H- 1 NMR and C- 13 NMR. <b>Crosslinked</b> networks with high biobased content of more than 88 % were obtained after co-photopolymerization between acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) and GACA. The thermal, mechanical and coating properties of these GACA <b>crosslinked</b> AESO networks were investigated and a commonly used <b>crosslink</b> agent triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC) {{was used as the}} control. GACA exhibited more functional groups and better copolymerization with AESO than TAIC, resulting in the higher gel content, <b>crosslink</b> density, tensile strength and modulus as well as much better coating properties (reflected by the higher pencil hardness, better wear resistance and adhesion) of GACA <b>crosslinked</b> AESO networks than TAIC <b>crosslinked</b> AESO networks. These results indicated that GACA exhibited great potential to replace petroleum-based <b>crosslink</b> agents such as TAIC, and high-performance soybean oil-based UV-cured coatings with high biobased content could be achieved after introducing GACA...|$|R
30|$|Actually, {{assessments}} of the clinical behaviour of <b>crosslinked</b> UHMWPE depend on radiographic measurement analyses: these demonstrate an initial penetration of the femoral head into the <b>crosslinked</b> insert, followed by a decreased penetration {{after the first year}} compared to conventional inserts. The initial penetration observed in <b>crosslinked</b> inserts, in vivo and not in laboratory wear tests, has been explained as creep deformation and not as wear. The results indicate decreased wear for <b>crosslinked</b> UHMWPE compared to conventional UHMWPE. To our knowledge, most studies have reported good <b>crosslinked</b> insert performance regardless of the manufacturer [11, 46 – 51]; moreover, {{there is no evidence of}} large-scale failures of knee or hip implants with <b>crosslinked</b> components due to particle-induced osteolysis, only sporadic case reports [52] of fatigue failure [45, 53].|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the action of the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin, it is necessary to determine why some types of cisplatin-DNA intrastrand <b>crosslinks</b> are repaired better than others. Using cell extracts and circular duplex DNA, we compared nucleotide excision repair of uniquely placed 1, 2 -GG, 1, 2 -AG, and 1, 3 -GTG cisplatin-crosslinks, and a 2 -acetylaminofluorene lesion. The 1, 3 <b>crosslink</b> and the acetylaminofluorene lesion were repaired by normal cell extracts approximately 15 - 20 fold better than the 1, 2 <b>crosslinks.</b> No evidence was found for selective shielding of 1, 2 cisplatin <b>crosslinks</b> from repair by cellular proteins. Fractionation of cell extracts to remove putative shielding proteins did not improve repair of the 1, 2 -GG <b>crosslink,</b> and cell extracts did not selectively inhibit access of UvrABC incision nuclease to 1, 2 -GG <b>crosslinks.</b> The poorer repair of 1, 2 <b>crosslinks</b> in comparison to the 1, 3 <b>crosslink</b> is more likely a consequence of different structural alterations of the DNA helix. In support of this, a 1, 2 -GG-cisplatin <b>crosslink</b> was much better repaired when it was opposite one or two non-complementary thymines. Extracts from cells defective in the hMutSalpha mismatch binding activity also showed preferential repair of the 1, 3 <b>crosslink</b> over the 1, 2 <b>crosslink,</b> and increased repair of the 1, 2 adduct when opposite thymines, showing that hMutSalphais not involved in the differential NER of these substrates in vitro. Mismatched cisplatin adducts could arise by translesion DNA synthesis, and improved repair of such adducts could promote cisplatin-induced mutagenesis in some cases...|$|R

25|$|Peroxide <b>crosslinking</b> (PE-Xa): The <b>crosslinking</b> of {{polyethylene}} using peroxides (e. g. dicumyl or di-tert-butyl peroxide) {{is still}} of major importance. In the so-called Engel process, {{a mixture of}} HDPE and 2 % peroxide is at first mixed at low temperatures in an extruder and then crosslinked at high temperatures (between 200 and 250°C). The peroxide decomposes to peroxide radicals (RO•), which abstract (remove) hydrogen atoms from the polymer chain, leading to radicals. When these combine, a crosslinked network is formed. The resulting polymer network is uniform, of low tension and high flexibility, whereby it is softer and tougher than (the irradiated) PE-Xc.|$|E

By <b>crosslinking</b> low-temperature impact strength, abrasion resistance and environmental stress cracking resistance {{can be increased}} significantly, whereas hardness and rigidity are somewhat reduced. PE-X does not melt anymore (analogous to elastomers) and is thermally resistant (over longer periods of up to 120°C, for short periods without mechanical load up to 250°C). With increasing <b>crosslinking</b> density also the maximum shear modulus increases (even at higher temperatures). PE-X has significantly enhanced properties compared with ordinary PE.
