5|$|Although the {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} die offs was the <b>chytrid,</b> climate change {{played a pivotal role}} in the extinctions. Researchers included this subtle connection in their inclusive climate-linked epidemic hypothesis, which acknowledged climatic change as a key factor in amphibian extinctions both in Costa Rica and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} poison dart frogs have {{recently}} experienced habitat loss, <b>chytrid</b> diseases, and collection for the pet trade. Some {{are listed as}} threatened or endangered as a result. Zoos have tried to counteract this disease by treating captive frogs with an antifungal agent {{that is used to}} cure athlete's foot in humans.|$|E
40|$|Many {{phytoplankton}} {{species are}} susceptible to fungal parasitism. Parasitic fungi of phytoplankton mainly belong to the Chytridiomycetes (<b>chytrids).</b> Here, we discuss the progression made {{in the study of}} <b>chytrids</b> that parasitize phytoplankton species. Specific fluorescent stains aid in the identification of <b>chytrids</b> in the field. The established culturing methods and the advances in molecular science offer good potential to gain a better insight into the mechanisms of epidemic development of <b>chytrids</b> and coevolution between <b>chytrids</b> and their algal hosts. <b>Chytrids</b> are often considered to be highly host-specific parasites, but the extent of host specificity has not been fully investigated. <b>Chytrids</b> may prefer larger host cells, since they would gain more resources, but whether hosts are really {{selected on the basis of}} size is not clear. The dynamics of <b>chytrids</b> epidemics in a number of studies were partly explained by environmental factors such as light, temperature, nutrients, pH, turbulence and zooplankton grazing. No generalization was made about the epidemic conditions; some state unfavorable conditions for the host growth support epidemic development, while others report epidemics even under optimal growth conditions for the host. Phytoplankton is not defenseless, and several mechanisms have been suggested, such as a hypersensitivity response, chemical defense, maintaining a high genetic diversity and multitrophic indirect defenses. <b>Chytrids</b> may also play an important role in food webs, because zoospores of <b>chytrids</b> have been found to be a good food source for zooplankton...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Chytrids</b> mainly infect {{algae and}} other {{eukaryotic}} and prokaryotic microbes. The infection {{can be so}} severe as to control primary production within the lake. [...] It {{has been suggested that}} parasitic <b>chytrids</b> have a large effect on lake and pond food webs. <b>Chytrids</b> may also infect plant species; in particular, Synchytrium endobioticum is an important potato pathogen.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chytrids</b> are saprobic, {{degrading}} {{refractory materials}} such as chitin and keratin, and sometimes act as parasites. There {{has been a significant}} increase in the research of <b>chytrids</b> since the discovery of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the causal agent of chytridiomycosis.|$|R
5|$|Other factors {{thought to}} affect this species include {{predation}} by introduced mammals, such as cats and foxes, changes to water quality at breeding sites, herbicide use, {{and loss of}} habitat through the destruction of wetlands. The amphibian <b>chytrid</b> fungus appears to have led to {{at least some of}} the decline in numbers, but the relative importance of the various factors is unclear. The frogs may have become more susceptible to <b>chytrid</b> rather than the fungus being more common. The genetic pool of the frogs has been found to be relatively small, attributed to habitat destruction, which has confined the smaller groups of frogs to isolated pockets and increased the incidence of inbreeding. This has led to proposals for frog populations to be mixed by human intervention in an attempt to reduce negative genetic effects and boost survival rates.|$|E
5|$|The Eccrinales and Amoebidiales are opisthokont protists, {{previously}} {{thought to be}} zygomycete fungi. Other groups now in Opisthokonta (e.g., Corallochytrium, Ichthyosporea) were also at given time classified as fungi. The genus Blastocystis, now in Stramenopiles, was originally classified as a yeast. Ellobiopsis, now in Alveolata, was considered a <b>chytrid.</b> The bacteria were also included in fungi in some classifications, as the group Schizomycetes.|$|E
5|$|Fungi have a {{worldwide}} distribution, and grow {{in a wide}} range of habitats, including extreme environments such as deserts or areas with high salt concentrations or ionizing radiation, as well as in deep sea sediments. Some can survive the intense UV and cosmic radiation encountered during space travel. Most grow in terrestrial environments, though several species live partly or solely in aquatic habitats, such as the <b>chytrid</b> fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a parasite that has been responsible for {{a worldwide}} decline in amphibian populations. This organism spends part of its life cycle as a motile zoospore, enabling it to propel itself through water and enter its amphibian host. Other examples of aquatic fungi include those living in hydrothermal areas of the ocean.|$|E
5|$|The Chytridiomycota are {{commonly}} known as <b>chytrids.</b> These fungi are distributed worldwide. <b>Chytrids</b> and their close relatives Neocallimastigomycota and Blastocladiomycota (below) are the only fungi with active motility, producing zoospores that are capable of active movement through aqueous phases with a single flagellum, leading early taxonomists to classify them as protists. Molecular phylogenies, inferred from rRNA sequences in ribosomes, suggest that the <b>Chytrids</b> are a basal group divergent from the other fungal phyla, consisting of four major clades with suggestive evidence for paraphyly or possibly polyphyly.|$|R

5|$|Many populations, {{particularly}} in the Sydney region, inhabit areas of infrequent disturbance, such as golf courses, disused industrial land, brick pits, and landfill areas. Though {{once one of the}} most common frogs in south-east Australia, the green and golden bell frog has endured major population declines, {{particularly in}} highland areas, leading to its current classification as globally vulnerable. Its numbers have continued to fall and are threatened by habitat loss and degradation, pollution, introduced species, and parasites and pathogens, including the <b>chytrid</b> Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. As most of the remaining populations live on private land, the logistics of the conservation effort can be complicated. Despite the situation in Australia, some frog populations have survived with more success in New Zealand and several other Pacific islands, where it has been introduced. However, unfortunately even in these areas the population of green and golden bell has been rapidly declining in the past few decades.|$|E
25|$|In total, {{there are}} seven species of {{introduced}} mammals and four introduced bird species within the park. Foxes and feral dogs are a threat to koalas, and Feral cats and foxes are a real danger to many threatened species within the Upland Swamp region. Bats are especially vulnerable to feral cat predators. Feral cats, foxes and mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis) have been listed as creating key threatening processes (predation, competition and vegetation alteration) under the Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995 (NSW). <b>Chytrid</b> fungus infecting frogs and feral deer causing environmental degradation (such as trampling and accelerating erosion), are also considered to cause threatening processes.|$|E
25|$|The Eungella National Park, {{where the}} {{northern}} gastric-brooding frog was once found, was under threat from bushfires and weed invasion. Continual fires may have destroyed or fragmented {{sections of the}} forest. The outskirts of the park are still subject to weed invasion and <b>chytrid</b> fungus has been located within several rainforest creeks within the park. It was thought that the declines of the northern gastric-brooding frog during 1984 and 1985 were possibly normal population fluctuations. Eight months after the initial discovery of the northern gastric-brooding frog, sick and dead Eungella torrent frogs, which cohabitat the streams with gastric brooding frogs, were observed in streams in Pelion State Forest. Given the more recent {{understanding of the role}} of the amphibian disease in the decline and disappearance of amphibians, combined with the temporal and spatial pattern of the spread of the pathogen in Australia, it appears most likely that the disease was responsible for the decline and disappearance of the gastric-brooding frogs. Despite continued efforts to locate the northern gastric-brooding frog it has not been found. The last reported wild specimen was seen in the 1980s. In August 2010 a search organised by the Amphibian Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature set out to look for various species of frogs thought to be extinct in the wild, including the gastric-brooding frog.|$|E
5000|$|Arguably, {{the most}} {{important}} ecological function <b>chytrids</b> perform is decomposition. These ubiquitous and cosmopolitan organisms are responsible for decomposition of refractory materials, such as pollen, cellulose, chitin, and keratin. There are also <b>chytrids</b> that live and grow on pollen by attaching threadlike structures, called rhizoids, onto the pollen grains. [...] This mostly occurs during asexual reproduction because the zoospores that become attached to the pollen continuously reproduce and form new <b>chytrids</b> that will attach to other pollen grains for nutrients. This colonization of pollen happens during the spring time when bodies of water accumulate pollen falling from trees and plants.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} the first {{assessment}} of the quantitative impact of parasitic <b>chytrids</b> on a planktonic food web. We used a carbon-based food web model of Lake Pavin (Massif Central, France) to investigate the effects of <b>chytrids</b> during the spring diatom bloom by developing models with and without <b>chytrids.</b> Linear inverse modelling procedures were employed to estimate undetermined flows in the lake. The Monte Carlo Markov chain linear inverse modelling procedure provided estimates of the ranges of model-derived fluxes. Model results support recent theories on the probable impact of parasites on food web function. In the lake, during spring, when 'inedible' algae (unexploited by planktonic herbivores) were the dominant primary producers, the epidemic growth of <b>chytrids</b> significantly reduced the sedimentation loss of algal carbon to the detritus pool through the production of grazer-exploitable zoospores. We also review some theories about the potential influence of parasites on ecological network properties and argue that parasitism contributes to longer carbon path lengths, higher levels of activity and specialization, and lower recycling. Considering the "structural asymmetry" hypothesis as a stabilizing pattern, <b>chytrids</b> should contribute to the stability of aquatic food webs...|$|R

500|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog's {{reproduction}} depends on salinity and water temperature. Salinity affects tadpoles' development and metamorphosis, and breeding is significantly slowed for ponds that measure [...] or below. The tadpoles can tolerate salinity levels of six parts per thousand (ppt) without any apparent effects, while salinity of 8ppt or higher decreases growth rates and increases mortality rates. On the other hand, salinity levels {{of at least}} 1–2ppt can be beneficial to the green and golden bell frog because this kills pathogens such as the <b>chytrid</b> fungus. The pH of the pond is not found to affect {{the likelihood of the}} eggs to hatch for values between 4 and 10.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its collection, the herpetologists who later {{described}} Ecnomiohyla rabborum were already aware of the encroaching threat of the <b>chytrid</b> fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (colloquially referred to by biologists as [...] "Bd") in Panama. The fungus causes an infectious amphibian disease called chytridiomycosis, which has been linked to the massive decline and extinction of amphibian species in certain parts of the world; including the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Infected amphibians can display a wide variety of symptoms, usually including lethargic and abnormal behavior, convulsions, peeling skin, ulcers, and hemorrhaging; eventually resulting in death. The origin of the disease is unknown, but there is speculation that it may have been introduced throughout the world via importation of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis).|$|E

50|$|Growth {{continues}} {{until a new}} {{batch of}} zoospores are ready for release. <b>Chytrids</b> have a diverse set of release mechanisms that can be grouped into the broad categories of operculate or inoperculate. Operculate discharge involves the complete or incomplete detachment of a lid-like structure, called an operculum, allowing the zoospores out of the sporangium. Inoperculate <b>chytrids</b> release their zoospores through pores, slits, or papillae.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Chytrids</b> {{have several}} {{different}} growth patterns. Some are holocarpic, {{which means they}} only produce a zoosporangium and zoospores. Others are eucarpic, meaning they produce other structures, such as rhizoids, {{in addition to the}} zoosporangium and zoospores. Some <b>chytrids</b> are monocentric, meaning a single zoospore gives rise to a single zoosporangium. Others are polycentric, meaning one zoospore gives rise to many zoosporangium connected by a rhizomycelium. Rhizoids do not have nuclei while a rhizomycelium can.|$|R

2500|$|During the 1980s, {{population}} declines {{were reported}} in Australian frog species and are severe in some areas. Many of the frogs that were reported as declining were high altitude, creek dwelling species that were remote from a changing ecology. This indicated that habitat loss and degradation were not responsible for all the declines; the cause is unknown but a diseases known as <b>chytrid</b> fungus may be a factor. In some cases entire genera were found declining. Both species of gastric brooding frog are now classified as extinct and all but two species of Taudactylus are critically endangered (Taudactylus diurnus is classified as extinct and Taudactylus liemi is classified as near threatened).
