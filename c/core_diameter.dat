25|$|The {{most common}} type of {{single-mode}} fiber has a <b>core</b> <b>diameter</b> of 8–10 micrometers and is designed for use in the near infrared. The mode structure depends on the wavelength of the light used, so that this fiber actually supports a small number of additional modes at visible wavelengths. Multi-mode fiber, by comparison, is manufactured with core diameters as small as 50 micrometers and as large as hundreds of micrometers. The normalized frequency V for this fiber should be less than the first zero of the Bessel function J0 (approximately 2.405).|$|E
25|$|Fiber with a <b>core</b> <b>diameter</b> {{less than}} about {{ten times the}} {{wavelength}} of the propagating light cannot be modeled using geometric optics. Instead, it must be analyzed as an electromagnetic structure, by solution of Maxwell's equations as reduced to the electromagnetic wave equation. The electromagnetic analysis may also be required to understand behaviors such as speckle that occur when coherent light propagates in multi-mode fiber. As an optical waveguide, the fiber supports one or more confined transverse modes by which light can propagate along the fiber. Fiber supporting only one mode is called single-mode or mono-mode fiber. The behavior of larger-core multi-mode fiber can also be modeled using the wave equation, which shows that such fiber supports more than one mode of propagation (hence the name). The results of such modeling of multi-mode fiber approximately agree with the predictions of geometric optics, if the fiber core {{is large enough to}} support more than a few modes.|$|E
25|$|Fiber {{with large}} <b>core</b> <b>diameter</b> (greater than 10micrometers) may be {{analyzed}} by geometrical optics. Such fiber is called multi-mode fiber, from the electromagnetic analysis (see below). In a step-index multi-mode fiber, rays of light are guided along the fiber core by total internal reflection. Rays {{that meet the}} core-cladding boundary at a high angle (measured relative to a line normal to the boundary), greater than the critical angle for this boundary, are completely reflected. The critical angle (minimum angle for total internal reflection) {{is determined by the}} difference in index of refraction between the core and cladding materials. Rays that meet the boundary at a low angle are refracted from the core into the cladding, and do not convey light and hence information along the fiber. The critical angle determines the acceptance angle of the fiber, often reported as a numerical aperture. A high numerical aperture allows light to propagate down the fiber in rays both close to the axis and at various angles, allowing efficient coupling of light into the fiber. However, this high numerical aperture increases the amount of dispersion as rays at different angles have different path lengths and therefore take different times to traverse the fiber.|$|E

40|$|Acoustic {{metamaterials}} {{provide the}} remarkable ability to control, direct, and manipulate sound waves. Within this infant field, a promising approach to fabricate locally resonant acoustic metamaterials {{is the use}} of resonators composed of a heavy core surrounded by a rubber shell dispersed in an epoxy matrix. At their resonant frequency, the cores vibrate 180 ° out-of-phase with the matrix, and a band gap in transmission is observed making these materials excellent sound absorbers. A significant challenge in the study and adoption of these materials is the lack of techniques to easily fabricate resonators {{with a wide range of}} sizes and properties. Here, we present a robust yet simple technique to fabricate resonators with diameters ranging from 50 µm to 5 mm from core-shell drops generated in microfluidic and millifluidic devices. We started by fabricating resonators with <b>core</b> <b>diameters</b> ranging from 50 µm to 1 mm from double emulsion drops composed of a concentrated ceramic suspension in the core (inner drop) surrounded by a UV-crosslinkable rubber shell (outer drop) using microcapillary microfluidic devices. The double emulsion drops were collected and exposed to UV to crosslink the shell material forming resonators with resonant frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 25 kHz based on the core mass. Even lower resonant frequencies were obtained by fabricating resonators with <b>core</b> <b>diameters</b> ranging from 1. 2 mm to 1. 7 mm from core-shell drops extruded in air from a coaxial nozzle at rates up to 6 drops/minute. The effects of core density were studied by utilizing suspensions composed of ceramic particles of increasing density including silica, alumina, and lead zirconate titanate (PZT). The transmission properties of the acoustic metamaterials made with resonators with different <b>core</b> <b>diameters,</b> <b>core</b> materials, and level of ordering within the matrix, were measured using a piezoelectric transducer setup capable of testing from 1 kHz to 50 kHz. For example, acoustic metamaterials composed of randomly dispersed 1. 4 mm alumina-core resonators at about 25 vol% concentration in epoxy showed a well-defined band-gap around 11 kHz. A finite element model was also developed by collaborators to capture the acoustic transmission physics of these materials. Overall this technique offers a robust path for the fabrication of acoustic resonators and locally resonant acoustic metamaterials. ...|$|R

An undoped crystalline silicon (100) substrate was used to fabricate 10 × 10 arrays of optrodes with rows of varying lengths from 0. 5 mm to 1. 5 mm on a 400 -µm pitch. Light delivery from optical fibers and loss mechanisms through these Si optrodes were characterized, with the primary loss mechanisms being Fresnel reflec-tion, coupling, radiation losses from the tapered shank and total internal reflection in the tips. Transmission at the optrode tips with different optical fiber <b>core</b> <b>diameters</b> and light in-coupling interfaces was investigated. At λ = 1. 55 µm, the highest optrode transmittance of 34. 7 %, relative to the optical fiber output power, was obtained with a 50 -µm multi-mode fiber butt-coupled to the optrode through an intervening medium of index n = 1. 66. Maximum power is directed into the optrodes when using fibers with <b>core</b> <b>diameters</b> of 200 µm or less.
