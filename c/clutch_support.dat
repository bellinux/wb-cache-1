Upon his return from Europe, he returned to perform with Zombie who had once again teamed up with Alice Cooper for the Halloween Hootenanny tour, a co-headlining tour which would also be supported by the Murderdolls. Jordison performed double duties on the tour, drumming for Zombie and playing guitar for the Murderdolls.

40|$|Information on the {{phenotypic}} {{correlates of}} male reproductive success can {{provide important insights}} into the operation of sexual selection, {{and the nature of}} evolutionary forces on phenotypic traits such as male body size. We combined results from a long-term mark–recapture field study with genetic analyses for identifying paternity of offspring to quantify male reproductive success in a colubrid snake species from tropical Australia. Because previous work has shown that male slatey-grey snakes, Stegonotus cucullatus, attain larger body sizes than do conspecific females, we predicted that larger males would have higher reproductive success. Our paternity assignments of 219 offspring (24 <b>clutches)</b> <b>supported</b> this prediction: larger males fathered more offspring, not because they obtained more matings, but because they fathered a higher proportion of offspring within the clutches to which they did contribute. Multiple paternity was common (mean of 2. 3 fathers per clutch, range 1 – 5). Our results demonstrate the utility of molecular approaches to clarify mating systems in field populations of snakes, and suggest that the evolution of extreme male-biased sexual size dimorphism in this species is attributable to enhanced reproductive success afforded by larger body size in males...|$|R

6000|$|But that, I found, was by {{no means}} so easy a matter as descending. I had got down partly by the mean and illegitimate device of letting my feet slide; to get back I must somehow secure a firm and certain {{foothold}} in the loose lava. To my surprise and horror there was none to be found. The soft and creamy pumice-stone seemed nowhere to afford a single solid point of support. I struggled in vain to recover my balance; at last, to my dismay, I stumbled and fell--fell, as I feared, towards the Floor of the Hawaiians, that yawned a full hundred and twenty feet of sheer depth in the crater below me. With a wild lunge I <b>clutched</b> for <b>support</b> at the plant in the cranny. It broke short in my hand, and my one chance gone, I rolled down rapidly to the very bottom. I didn't exactly tumble down the entire sheer height in a single fall; if I had I shouldn't be here to tell you. I broke the force of the descent somewhat by digging my hands and feet with frantic efforts into the loose wall of rotten lava. But before I could realize precisely what was happening I lost my head. The world reeled round me; my eyes closed. Next moment I was aware of a horrid thud, and a fierce blow against some hard surface. I knew then just where I had landed. I had fallen or rolled by stages the whole way down the crag, and was lying on my side on the Floor of the Hawaiians! ...|$|R

40|$|In Ghana, priority-setting for {{reproductive}} health service interventions {{is known to be}} rudimentary with little wider stakeholder involvement. In recognizing the need for broad stakeholder engagement to advance reproductive care provision and utilization, it is necessary to jointly study the varied stakeholder views on reproductive care services. We applied an ethnographic study approach where field data was collected between March-May 2015 in three rural districts of northern Ghana. Data was collected among women with recent births experiences (n = 90), health care providers (n = 16) and policy actors (n = 6). In-depth interviews and focus group discussions was applied to collect all data. Each stakeholder participant's audio file was transcribed, and repeatedly read through to identify similar and divergent views in data. A coding scheme guided coding processes. All transcripts were then imported into QSR NVivo 11 for further analysis. Four themes emerged. Women participants accentuated that sex and sexuality values of men have changed over time, and drives gender roles, parity levels and decision making on reproductive care needs at community levels. Sexual stigma on reproductive care reduces the willingness of women to voice poor experiences related to their previous reproductive experiences. All stakeholders' highlighted clinical treatments for post-abortion care are minimally covered under the fee exemption policy for antenatal and postnatal care. Policy processes on service delivery protocols still is top-down in Ghana. Health teams working to improve sexual and reproductive health care must find suitable context strategies that effectively work to improve women reproductive care needs at their operational levels.

40|$|This {{proposal}} {{is for the}} development of an automated clutch release measurement device for Tilton Engineering, Inc. Tilton has expressed its desire for a piece of test equipment to supplement their existing CT 2000 clutch clamp load testing machine. This device will acquire r el e as e load and travel data for the pressure plate of a clutch immediately after it is tested for clamp load on the CT 2000 machine, and will serve as a quality control check for Tilton’s clutches before they are sent out to the customer. Tilton wants a clutch release test machine to ensure that their assembly and manufacturing processes are meeting their engineering specifications. They will also be able to gather more data during R 2 ̆ 6 D which will help with the creation of better quality products. Currently Tilton does not have an accurate method of measuring c l u t c h release load and travel for their rebuilt clutches. This would be a useful verification to ensure that the clutch has been rebuilt to specification. Being able to pass this information on to the customer would also provide an extra level of verification and data. This machine will do the following for Tilton: 1. Help the customer select the best Tilton clutch for their requirements and their needs. 2. Verify that their clutch has been rebuilt to their satisfaction as well as Tilton’s specifications. 3. Verify that the release force of the rebuilt clutch is the same (or similar) to a brand new unit. 4. Allow Tilton Engineering to accurately measure and document the release loads for all clutches in the product line. This will allow Tilton to publish this data for customers that may need it and to establish upper and lower levels of what will be acceptable for quality control. 5. Provide release load data to the customer for their specific new and/or rebuilt <b>clutch</b> assemblies. 6. <b>Support</b> new research and development of new components and assemblies to augment the product line. 7. Provide a new tool for returned goods evaluation and failure analysis. This project has a number of individuals and organizations who are invested in the success of the project. These include: -‐ Tilton Engineering, Inc. – Sponsor -‐ Casey Lund – Contact -‐ Cal Poly Mechanical Engineering Department -‐ Dr. Tom Mase – Advisor -‐ Ryan Bylard, Kevin Campbell, Trevor Hebbel – Team Members Our goal is to produce a complete, working, fully documented device by Thursday, May 30 th, 2013, the date of the Cal Poly Senior Project Expo. In addition, we aim to f ulfill all customer requirements and meet our self-set engineering targets, deliver t h e project within necessary budget constraints, and produce full documentation of each step of the process...|$|R
