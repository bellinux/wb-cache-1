5000|$|Invented and {{patented}} by an American engineer of Ukrainian descent William Dzus (Volodymyr Dzhus) {{in the early}} 1930s, Dzus fasteners are also used to <b>secure</b> <b>plates,</b> doors, and panels that require frequent removal for inspection and servicing. These fasteners are notable {{in that they are}} of an [...] "over-centre" [...] design, requiring positive sustained torque to unfasten. Thus, any minor disturbance to the fastener (e.g. vibration) will tend to correct itself rather than proceed to further loosening as it would in threaded fasteners. Turnlock fasteners are available in several different styles and are usually referred to by the manufacturer's trade name. Some of the most common are DZUS, Camloc, and Airloc.|$|R

5000|$|The modern aiguillette {{derives from}} the laces used to <b>secure</b> <b>plates</b> of armor together—the breast- and back-plates would be {{attached}} on one side with short loops of cord acting as a hinge, {{and on the other}} by a longer and more ornate tied one,to support the arm defences. The ensuing knots would hang down the shoulder. (As with combat boots, the longer the lace, the less the need to undo the entire lace.) As armour became more ornamental and less practical, so too did the ties. This would also explain the aiguillettes of varying levels of complexity in the uniforms of the Household Cavalry (see picture above), as opposed to other [...] "unarmored" [...] troops.|$|R

The proposed SOA model for on-line load flow monitoring is highly distributed and has inherent features such as scalability, reliability and also uses available computing power, hence economic feasibility is taken care implicitly.

30|$|The {{primary goal}} in {{treatment}} of post-traumatic deformity of the distal radius is to restore anatomical alignment and prevent secondary displacement. Traditionally, extra-articular osteotomy is performed to re-establish volar tilt in the saggital plane and radial inclination in the coronal plane, correct any rotational malalignment in the horizontal plane, and restore radial length [14, 15]. Several fixation modalities {{are available for}} distal radius osteotomy. Osteosynthesis with dorsal and/or volar plates needs sufficient exposure to facilitate direct visualization, accurate reduction, and <b>secure</b> <b>plating</b> fixation. Common criticisms exist regarding wide soft-tissue dissection, tendon complication including tenosynovitis or tendon rupture, and prominence of hardware with internal fixation plate. Many patients need subsequent removal of the implant [16 – 18]. Intramedullary nails for fixation of the distal radius are intended to minimize those complications in treatment of post-traumatic deformity of distal radius [19]. With the benefits of limited soft-tissue dissection, a low-profile implant with less risk of tendon attrition, divergent subchondral screw placement, and locked fixed-angle fixation, the intramedullary nail serves as an internal splint to provide sufficient stability, allow immediate active motion at the fracture site and acquire healing through peripheral callus remodeling [11, 20, 21].|$|R

40|$|Abstract- SCADA {{refers to}} a large-scale, {{distributed}} measurement(and control) system. SCADA is not a specific technology, but a type of application. SCADA stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition — any application that gets data about a system {{in order to control}} that system is a SCADA application. A SCADA application has two elements: 1. The process/system/machinery we want to monitor a control — this can be a power plant, a watersystem, a network, a system of traffic lights, or anything else. 2. A network of intelligent devices that interfaces with the first system through sensors and control outputs. Now modern SCADA system network are associated with large area through LAN/WAN. So automatically the secure security system of SCADA is necessary and for that in this paper we have propose a <b>complete</b> <b>secure</b> SCADA system base on the MiniSec, a secure network layer protocol for wireless sensor networks.

40|$|Computer {{security}} {{has become the}} main stream issue to protect the sensitive information in open networks. The <b>complete</b> <b>secure</b> system is hard to design these days due to vulnerabilities in firewalls, file and application servers, email servers, and Web servers.

A popular way to implement security protocols uses a combination of several cryptographic schemes to overcome various limitations of security primitives. The design of scalable security protocols that are interrelated with a single cryptosystem for multimedia is a challenging cryptographic technology in the cryptologic research community. We propose the Scalable cryptographic scheme for security services in this paper. The proposed Eigen-based security primitives solves a wide range of secrecy, non repudiation, authenticity, and integrity problems in many security aware multimedia applications. The new cryptography technology may {{play an important role in}} the trusted network interpretation environments. 1...|$|R
40|$|Research Proposal Summary (200 words) - In the {{financial}} services domain, large monoliths of software products are used to control all financial flows in any type of organization. Software monoliths have several well-known disadvantages, recognized by both the vendors and customers of these software products. Examples of these disadvantages are inflexibility, domain unspecificity, {{and the fact that}} these systems tend to be hard to maintain. Both vendors and customers of these systems are perfectly aware that better and cheaper customer specific solutions can be created along the service oriented paradigm. It is non-trivial, however, for vendors of monoliths to chop up their product into <b>complete,</b> <b>secure,</b> deployable, and useful services to be reused in service configurations. This project aims to extract large numbers of services from monolithic products and open source components in {{the financial}} services domain using the Service Extraction Process.

40|$|Abstract — Positioning Systems {{are not a}} new {{technology}} anymore and they do find various applications. Global Positioning Services and Location Based Services have been always used to help people to travel {{from one place to}} another, and various such navigation systems have been developed for the same. But one such use of GPS and LBS is tracking the location of mobile devices. The facility is not new but it is being used by authoritative forces only. But this technology is not being widely used as a service available to the public. Here we first give an introduction to the concept which could be realized using the framework discussed in this paper, along with the technologies that would be involved in designing such a framework, proceeding to give a generalized framework for such mobile tracking systems to be made available to public to track their family and friends with their permission. The framework to be discussed here will ensure that the system that will be developed will be <b>complete,</b> <b>secure</b> and will focus on performance and efficiency at the same time...|$|R
50|$|After {{eight years}} without racing, the Rapier 6 was brought out of {{retirement}} in 2011, {{for use in the}} Britcar Endurance Championship. Millard ran the car alongside Ian Heward, and their team ran under the Flat-Six.co.uk banner. Millard and Heward finished the first race of the season, held at Silverstone, but only completed 46 laps, and were not classified. The pair retired from the next round, held at Rockingham, after one-and-three-quarter hours, and having completed 68 laps. It was a similar story at Donington Park, where Millard and Heward completed 51 laps in one hour 20 minutes before retiring. At Spa-Francorchamps, Millard and Heward won the race by two minutes from the Marcos Mantis of Topcats Racing, thus giving the Rapier 6 its first ever overall win. The final race of the season, held at Castle Combe, was less successful; the team retired after one-and-three-quarter hours, but the 83 laps they had <b>completed</b> <b>secured</b> them 19th overall, and fourth in Class 1.
