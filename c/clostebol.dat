40|$|Anabolic {{androgenic}} steroids (AAS) are {{synthetic testosterone}} derivatives which undergo extensive metabolism in man. Differences in the excretion of phase II metabolites are {{strongly associated with}} inter-individual and inter-ethnic variations. Sulfate metabolites {{have been described as}} long-term metabolites for some AAS. <b>Clostebol</b> is the 4 -chloro derivative of testosterone and the aim {{of the present study was}} the evaluation of <b>clostebol</b> sulfate metabolites in Caucasian population by LC-MS/MS technology. <b>Clostebol</b> was orally administered to four healthy Caucasian male volunteers, and excretion study urines were collected up to 31 days. Several analytical strategies (neutral loss scan, precursor ion scan and selected reaction monitoring acquisitions modes) were applied to detect sulfate metabolites in post-administration samples. Sixteen sulfate metabolites were detected, five of them having detectability times above 10 days (S 1 a, S 2 a, S 3 b, S 3 g and S 4 b). Interestingly, metabolite S 1 a could be detected up to the last collected sample of all excretion studies and it was characterized by LC-MS/MS and GC-MS as 4 ξ-chloro- 5 α-androst- 3 β-ol- 17 -one 3 β-sulfate. Thus, monitoring of S 1 a improves the detection time of <b>clostebol</b> misuse with respect to the commonly monitored metabolites, excreted in the glucuronide fraction.

METHODS: A total of 45 male Wistar rats were used, in which a skin flap of total thickness with an area of 4 cm² was removed. The animals were divided randomly into 3 groups of 15 rats each, Control, Reference and Test groups, which were treated topically with 0. 9 % NaCl, a preparation of <b>clostebol</b> combined with neomycin sulfate and the test formulation, respectively. The wound areas were measured by digital planimetry at days zero, 3, 7 and 12 postoperative. Based on the wound area, we determined the degree of tissue repair and mean rate of repair at different time intervals. RESULTS: At day 3, an expansion of the wound area was observed in the Reference group and slight contraction in the Control and Test groups. On the subsequent days, the healing process, according to the degree of repair, proceeded in a linear manner, such that, at day 12, the healed area reached 77. 95 % of the initial ulcerated region in the Control group, 78. 40 % in the Reference group and 83. 49 % in the Test group, showing no significant differences. The overall mean rate of repair was equally similar at 12 days of treatment: 25. 79 mm²/dia in the Control group, 25. 42 mm²/dia in the Reference group and 27. 38 mm²/dia in the Test group.

Os animais foram distribuÃdos aleatoriamente em grupos constituÃdos de 15 ratos compreendendo trÃs experimentos constituÃdos dos grupos Controle e ReferÃncia e dos grupos Amorfa-aquosa e Cristalina-aquosa (Experimento 1), Amorfa-gel e Cristalina-gel (Experimento 2) e TriglicerÃdeo (Experimento 3). Tais grupos foram tratados por via tÃpica, respectivamente, com soluÃÃo salina 0, 9 %, <b>clostebol</b> + sulfato de neomicina, Ãgua de coco amorfa e cristalina-aquosa, Ãgua de coco amorfa e cristalina-gel e DersaniÂ. As Ãreas das feridas foram mensuradas por planimetria digital nos dias zero, 3, 7 e 12 de pÃs-operatÃrio, a partir das quais foram calculados o grau e a taxa mÃdia de reparaÃÃo. AlÃm disso, o processo de cicatrizaÃÃo foi avaliado atravÃs dos critÃrios de Myers e da quantificaÃÃo de colÃgeno e angiogÃnese utilizando mÃtodo histoquÃmico. No 3 o dia observou-se uma expansÃo da Ãrea da ferida no grupo referÃncia e uma leve contraÃÃo nos grupos controle e testes. Nos dias subseqÃentes o processo de reparaÃÃo, medido pela variÃvel grau de reparaÃÃo, evoluiu de forma linear, de modo que, no 12 o dia, a Ãrea reparada alcanÃou 77, 95 % da regiÃo ulcerada inicial no grupo Controle, 78, 40 % no ReferÃncia, 82, 24 % no Amorfa-aquosa, 84, 12 % no Cristalina-aquosa 84, 12 % (experimento 1), 85, 09 % no grupo Amorfa-gel, 84, 20 % no Cristalina-gel (experimento 2) e 83, 49 % no TriglicerÃdeo (experimento 3), nÃo sendo constatadas diferenÃas estatisticamente significantes em nenhum dos experimentos. Igualmente semelhantes foram os valores da taxa mÃdia de reparaÃÃo referente aos 12 dias de tratamento: 25, 79 mm 2 /dia no grupo Controle, 25, 42 mm 2 /dia no ReferÃncia, 26, 48 mm 2 /dia no Amorfa-aquosa, 27, 89 mm 2 /dia no Cristalinaaquosa, 26, 47 mm 2 /dia no Amorfa-gel, 27, 04 mm 2 /dia no Cristalina-gel e 27, 38 mm 2 /dia no TriglicerÃdeo.

This study assessed the effect of a compound medium-chain triglycerides, linoleic acid, soy lecithins and vitamins A and E (Dersan) and also lyophilized coconut water in the aqueous and gel forms in the process of healing of experimental cutaneous ulcers. 105 male Wistar rats were employed in which a 4 cm 2 full thickness skin segment was removed. The animals were randomly distributed into groups constituted of 15 rats comprising three experiments consisting of Control and Reference groups, as well as Amorphous-Aqueous and Crystalline-Aqueous groups (Experiment 1), Amorphous-gel and Crystalline-gel groups (Experiment 2) and Triglycerides (Experiment 3). Such groups were treated via topic, respectively with 0. 9 % saline, clostebol+neomycin sulphate, amorphous and crystalline coconut water, amorphous and crystalline-gel coconut water and Dersani. The wound areas were measured by digital planimetry at post-operative days zero, 3, 7 and 12; from them the degree and average rate of repair were calculated. Moreover, the healing process was assessed through the criteria of Meyers and the amount of collagen and angiogenesis by means of histochemical methods. At day 3, an expansion of the wound area in the Reference Group and a slight contraction of Control Groups and tests were noted. On the subsequent days the process of repair, measured through the variable degree of healing evolved in a linear form, so that on the twelfth day, the repaired area achieved 77. 95 % of the initial ulcerated region in the Control Group, 78. 40 % in the Reference Group, 82. 24 %, in the Amorphous-Aqueous one, 84. 12 % in the Crystalline- Aqueous (Experiment 1), 85. 09 % in the Amorphus-gel Group, 84. 20 % in the Crystalline-gel Group (Experiment 2) and 83. 49 % in that of Triglyceride (Experiment 3); no statistically significant differences were found in the experiments. Equally similar were the values for the average rate of repair in regard to the 12 days of treatment: 25, 79 mm 2 /day in the Control Group, 25, 42 mm 2 /day in the Reference Group, 26. 48 mm 2 /day in the Amorphous-Aqueous one, 27. 89 mm 2 /day in the Crystalline-Aqueous Group, 26, 47 mm 2 /day in the Amorphous-gel Group, 27. 04 mm 2 /day in the Crystalline-gel and 27. 38 mm 2 /day in the Triglyceride Group. However, as to the Groups Amorphous-aqueous (P< 0, 01), Amorphous-gel (P< 0. 05), Crystalline Gel (P< 0, 05) and Triglycerides (P< 0, 01), the density of collagen was significantly higher than that observed in the Control Group.
