Based on {{the time}} window in the vehicle {{scheduling}} problem(VSP), we propose the concept of time windows <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> tasks(TWDT) in the distribution center, and describe the TWDT {{in a kind of}} three-tuple. Transferring time windows constraint of multiple tasks to a simple temporal constraint network, we simplify the problem <b>of</b> <b>checking</b> the time constraint of multiple tasks to the problem <b>of</b> <b>checking</b> the temporal constraint network’s consistency. According to the characteristic <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> task and simple temporal constraint network, we proposed the model of time window conflict <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> task...|$|R

40|$|N ° 10110 Title Global surface {{atmospheric}} fields from {{analyses and}} forecasts This task is n continuation {{from a similar}} one in the MFSPP and ADRICOSM projects and has been completed with two adaptation steps, made necessary by the MFSTEP context. Data and methods The main work at Météo-France has been to ensure a correct <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> AGCM 1 atmospheric model products. No major incident was noted. The server used to provide the data was changed, without any impact on the delivery process. The scientific involvement has been twofold: Regular control of the fields produced and scientific or technical hot line in case of problems. The regular <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>delivery</b> process has been made by technicians involved in similar projects hence with efficiency. Following the request from the oceanic modelling team in Bologna, some developments were completed mid-April 2003 {{in order to provide}} the atmospheric field 10 to 12 hours earlier every Wednesday. The other new element concerns the change of domain of OGCM that made necessary to shift from 6 °W to 19 °W {{the western edge of the}} domain on which AGCM 1 data are prepared. The work was done early January 2004 with a first effective implementation on 21 / 1 / 04. A catchup computation was also done to cover a-posteriori the first part of January 2004. The two productions (old and new domains) will run in parallel until early March, when the old domain production will be discontinued...|$|R
40|$|In India, {{utilisation}} {{of basic}} health services has remained poor. The reasons may be {{low levels of}} household income, high illiteracy and ignorance, {{and a host of}} traditional factors. In this paper an attempt is made to discuss the issues associated with the demand and supply of the five measures of maternity care-antenatal care, blood pressure <b>check</b> up, place <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> use <b>of</b> trained help at the time <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> and postnatal care. Econometric analysis is undertaken to find out the determinants of the use of reproductive health care services among rural Indian households. Rural data from 32, 000 households belonging to 1765 villages across all parts of India was collected by National Council of Applied Economic Research in 1994. The multi-model survey was conducted both at the national and state level. The analysis pertains to 7635 women in the reproductive age group who delivered a child in the year before the survey. The focus on the role of education, information and economic factors as determinants of health care accessibility and their utilisation is the speciality of this analysis. Analysis shows that education and information variables significantly increase the utilisation rates for prenatal, child delivery and postnatal health care. Women with primary education are more likely to use maternal health services as compared to illiterate women, even after controlling for income and health care supply factors. Exposure to media increases the probability of reproductive health care utilisation. Economic factors such as wages and income are important only for the utilisation <b>of</b> child <b>delivery</b> services. Access to locally available health services significantly increases maternity care use. An important health care facility in this respect has been the village level ICDS centre. Further, probit regressions analysis is used to xamine the impact of individual, household and community level variables on the above choices of reproductive health care.

40|$|Background. The {{study area}} is the Birbhum {{district}} of the State of West Bengal in India. It {{is one of the}} backward districts in India. Objectives. The paper investigates the existing pattern of obstetric health care practices and the factors associated with the utilization of such care. Method. The present analysis includes 495 adult married women of both rural and urban areas of nine Blocks of Birbhum district. Besides performing x 2 tests to see the association of the relevant individual and household characteristics, logistic regression was also carried out to measure the effect of these characteristics on the use of obstetric health care. Results. In Birbhum district of West Bengal 65 percent mothers go to doctors for antenatal check-up during their pregnancy, but only 26 percent mothers deliver their babies in institutions and 30 percent mothers get the help of professional health assistants during delivery. Educated women have emphasized role in the practice of obstetric health care. Husband’s education and the standard of living of the family also have some effect on the practice <b>of</b> antenatal <b>check</b> up, place <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> and assistance <b>of</b> health professional. While most of the family background variables have significant effect on the practice <b>of</b> antenatal <b>check</b> up, these variables do not have much effect on the choice <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> or seeking assistance of health professionals. Contrary to the popular belief the working status of women does not have favourable influence on the obstetric health care practices. In developing countries like India, it is the poverty, which compels the women to take jobs—that too in low paid jobs especially in rural backward areas. Conclusion. The status of literacy of mothers and standard of living of the family are of prime importance in improving the obstetric health care practices...|$|R

During their only visit to Baltimore they stayed at the Holiday Inn which housed the Circle One Revolving Restaurant located on the 13th floor. The famed Circle One restaurant (later known as The La Ronde), now an event space, was once one of the first revolving restaurants in the continental United States, offering stunning 360° city views, it made a full rotation every hour. The restaurant played host to the legendary Beatles, who dined there following their concert. John Lennon joked to a member of the tour group, [...] "Larry, I hear your whole world was spinning the other night".

The higher volume/weight utilization leads to the reduction of unit costs of transportation for the ‘last-mile’ distribution (economies of scale are achieved) [7]. Consequently, the number of vehicle kilometers {{is expected to be}} reduced, just like the number of freight vehicles in the network. The use of alternative modes of transport is promoted and is becoming more feasible i.e. indicating electric vehicles as the one that matches better to an urban context.

Proportion of the complication is 20 % <b>of</b> total <b>delivery</b> but only less then 10 % can be handled. Therefore we need to study the factors related to the complication <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> {{in the last three}} years in Indonesia.

30|$|Career {{practitioners}} {{might have}} concerns regarding formative {{issues such as}} how to procure effective outcomes and ensure continuity of the programs, both for individual and organizational stakeholder groups (Hughes et al. 2005). The results of a European survey conducted over 10  years ago (Sultana 2004) indicated paradigm shifts toward career services that have standards of practice and codes of conduct. The findings of our Delphi study could serve to inform such standards of practice. For example, practitioners can utilize the Delphi consensus items as checks and balances to ensure holistic, systemic, and comprehensive frameworks. Next, like for policy makers, needs assessment is a central issue for career practitioners (Kavale 2012). Practitioners can apply the results of the Delphi study as indicators of effective needs assessment procedures and processes, especially considering all stakeholder groups as well as determining end-user consumer needs. Moreover, trainer training being a key Delphi study result, can be utilized by practitioners to evaluate their current strengths and needs and also then, in turn, to advocate for additional resources and support for the professional development of trainers. Although this component requires supportive policies, such as compulsory training and standards, practitioners can employ self-assessment results to advocate for themselves with their employer or institution. Moreover, practitioners {{need to be able to}} evaluate their own programs and delivery. The Delphi results can serve as a guide to program development, during the implementation as reference points for process or quality checks, and after program delivery as evaluation items. Delivery items, as the fifth Delphi component, will likewise provide a tool for practitioners to <b>check</b> all aspects <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> before the implementation process. Lastly, evaluation considerations from the Delphi study will help practitioners to better understand all aspects of their youth WFD programs and interventions. These considerations also provide opportunities for collaborations between local researchers and career practitioners.|$|R
