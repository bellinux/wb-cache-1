5|$|In April 1997, Harper {{suggested}} that the Reform Party was drifting toward social <b>conservatism</b> and ignoring the principles of economic <b>conservatism.</b> The Liberal Party lost seats but managed to retain a narrow majority government in the 1997 federal election, while Reform made only modest gains.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} for explanations involving dietary <b>conservatism,</b> in which predators avoid new prey {{because it is}} an unknown quantity; this is a long-lasting effect. Dietary <b>conservatism</b> has been demonstrated experimentally in some species of birds.|$|E
5|$|V-Planner {{runs the}} {{variable}} permeability model, developed by D.E. Yount {{and others in}} 2000, and allows the choice of VPM-B and VPM-B/E, with six <b>conservatism</b> levels (baseline plus five incrementally more conservative ones). GAP allows the user to choose between a multitude of Bühlmann-based algorithms and the full reduced gradient bubble model, developed by Bruce Wienke in 2001, in its five <b>conservatism</b> levels (baseline, two incrementally more liberal and two incrementally more conservative).|$|E
5|$|As a {{political}} philosophy, one-nation <b>conservatism</b> reflects {{the belief that}} societies exist and develop organically, and that members within them have obligations towards each other. There is particular emphasis on the paternalistic obligation {{of those who are}} privileged and wealthy to the poorer parts of society.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{continuing}} debate surrounding his legacy, many conservative and liberal scholars agree that Reagan {{has been the}} most influential president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, leaving his imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics through his effective communication, dedicated patriotism and pragmatic compromising. Since he left office, historians have reached a consensus, 978-0-230-60302-8.)|journal=The Journal of American History|date=December 2009|volume=96|issue=3|pages=933–934|doi=10.1093/jahist/96.3.933|jstor=25622627}} as summarized by British historian M. J. Heale, who finds that scholars now concur that Reagan rehabilitated <b>conservatism,</b> turned the nation to the right, practiced a considerably pragmatic <b>conservatism</b> that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and in American exceptionalism, and contributed to victory in the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Rothbard {{left the}} Libertarian Party and began {{building}} bridges to the post-Cold War anti-interventionist right, calling himself a paleolibertarian, a conservative reaction against the cultural liberalism of mainstream libertarianism. Paleolibertarianism sought {{to appeal to}} disaffected working class whites through a synthesis of cultural <b>conservatism</b> and libertarian economics.|$|E
5|$|In Blackboard Jungle, a 1955 film {{starring}} Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier, Beiderbecke's {{music is}} briefly featured, {{but as a}} symbol of cultural <b>conservatism</b> in a nation on the cusp of the rock and roll revolution.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s green {{became the}} color of the third biggest Swiss Federal Council {{political}} party, the Swiss People's Party SVP. The ideology is Swiss nationalism, national <b>conservatism,</b> right-wing populism, economic liberalism, agrarianism, isolationism, euroscepticism. The SVP was founded on September 22, 1971 and has 90,000 members.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not a}} far {{stretch to}} imagine that if Agnew had contested {{corruption}} charges half as hard as Nixon denied culpability for Watergate – as Goldwater and several other stalwart conservatives wanted him to – today we might be speaking of Agnew-Democrats and Agnewnomics, and deem Agnew the father of modern <b>conservatism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many of Weber's works famous {{today were}} collected, revised and {{published}} posthumously. Significant interpretations of his writings were produced by such sociological luminaries as Talcott Parsons and C. Wright Mills. Parsons in particular imparted to Weber's works a functionalist, teleological perspective; this personal interpretation has been criticised for a latent <b>conservatism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Texas voters {{lean toward}} fiscal <b>conservatism,</b> while enjoying the {{benefits}} of huge federal investment {{in the state in}} military and other facilities achieved by the power of the Solid South in the 20th century. They also tend to have socially conservative values.|$|E
5|$|The {{ideology}} featured heavily during Disraeli's {{terms in}} government, during which considerable social reforms were passed. Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, the party moved away from paternalism in favour of free market capitalism, but fears of extremism during the interwar period caused the revival of one-nation <b>conservatism.</b> The philosophy continued to be held by the Conservative party throughout the post-war consensus, influencing the decision to maintain Labour government Keynesian intervention in the economy, forming a welfare state and National Health Service. Later years saw the rise of the New Right, which attributed the country's social and economic troubles to one-nation <b>conservatism.</b> David Cameron, former leader of the Conservative Party, named Disraeli as his favourite Conservative and some commentators and MPs have suggested that Cameron's ideology contains an element of one-nationism. Other commentators have questioned the degree to which Cameron and his coalition have embodied One-Nation <b>Conservatism,</b> instead locating them in the intellectual tradition of Thatcherism. In 2016, Cameron's successor, Theresa May, referred to herself as a one-nation conservative in her first speech as prime minister and outlined her focus on social justice.|$|E
5|$|The {{model has}} been used to some extent in some Suunto dive computers, and in the HydroSpace Explorer computer, where it is a user {{selected}} option for computation formula, with a choice of additional <b>conservatism</b> factors.|$|E
5|$|Chuck Baldwin was {{initially}} a Democrat, but changed his party affiliation to Republican in 1980. In the 1970s, he founded Crossroad Baptist Church in Pensacola, Florida, which President Ronald Reagan recognized for its growth and influence. As a Republican, Baldwin headed the Florida branch of Moral Majority, which promoted social <b>conservatism.</b> He also hosted {{a radio show}} called Chuck Baldwin Live, which focused on conservative issues. It made its national radio debut on the Genesis Communications Network in 2001.|$|E
5|$|During Sa'ad Zaghloul's term as {{minister}} of education, {{before he went}} on to lead the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, further efforts were made to modify the educational policy of al-Azhar. While a bastion of <b>conservatism</b> in many regards, the mosque was opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, especially as espoused by the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928. The school attracted students from throughout the world, including students from Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia, providing a counterbalance to the influence of the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Manning succeeded Aberhart as premier. Under Manning, Social Credit {{moved away}} from the {{monetary}} theory of Douglas and towards traditional <b>conservatism.</b> Manning lead the party through seven-straight massive majorities, (although in 1955 his government received barely more seats than Aberhart had received in 1940, due to a strong but short-lived Liberal drive). After 24 years as premier, Manning resigned in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Fearing the {{influence}} of French Revolutionary ideals, particularly those of philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Trimmer emphasized orthodox Anglicanism and encouraged the perpetuation of the contemporary social and political order. Despite her <b>conservatism,</b> however, she agreed with Rousseau and other progressive educational reformers on many issues, such as the damaging effects of rote learning and the irrationalism of fairy tales.|$|E
5|$|Noted for {{publishing}} the biting satirical pieces and art chronicles of Tudor Arghezi, Seara was {{closely associated with}} the Romanian Symbolist movement. Through Arghezi, Bogdan-Pitești and other contributors, it campaigned in favor Symbolism and, after 1913, popularized modern art. Although paying tribute to political <b>conservatism</b> throughout its existence, Seara was also home to anti-establishment contributors, allies in the anti-Entente cause. The newspaper sympathized with the Social Democratic Party, regularly hosting opinion pieces by socialists and anarchists.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{prominent}} philosophers of the Enlightenment were John Locke, Thomas Paine, Samuel Johnson and Jeremy Bentham. More radical elements were later countered by Edmund Burke who is regarded as the founder of <b>conservatism.</b> The poet Alexander Pope with his satirical verse became well regarded. The English {{played a significant role in}} romanticism: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, John Keats, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, William Blake and William Wordsworth were major figures.|$|E
5|$|The Rage Against God (subtitle in US editions: How Atheism Led Me to Faith) is {{the fifth}} book by Peter Hitchens, first {{published}} in 2010. The book describes Hitchens's journey from atheism, far-left politics, and bohemianism, to Christianity and <b>conservatism,</b> detailing the influences on him {{that led to his}} conversion. The book is partly intended as a response to God Is Not Great, a book written by his brother Christopher Hitchens in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{personal}} decompression computer {{provides a}} real time modelling of the inert gas {{load on the}} diver according to the decompression algorithm programmed into the computer by the manufacturer, with possible personal adjustments for <b>conservatism</b> and altitude set by the user. In all cases the computer monitors the depth and elapsed time of the dive, and many allow user input specifying the gas mixture.|$|E
5|$|While {{generally}} {{adhering to}} American <b>conservatism,</b> McCain established {{a reputation as}} a political maverick for his willingness to defy Republican orthodoxy on several issues. In reaction to his Keating Five experience, he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns. He was also a leader in normalizing diplomatic relations with Vietnam. His national visibility as a senator gave him the basis to begin a campaign for the 2000 Republican nomination for President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Disraeli adopted one-nation <b>conservatism</b> {{for both}} ethical and electoral reasons. Before he became {{leader of the}} Conservative Party, Disraeli had {{announced}} that, {{as a result of}} the Reform Act 1867 which had enfranchised the male working-class, the party needed to pursue social reforms if it were to have electoral success. One-nationism would both improve the conditions of the poor and portray the Liberal Party as selfish individualists. Because the party portrayed itself as a national (and not class-based) party, it's members were unsure whether to make specific appeals to the working-classes. A more positive approach to the working-class by the party developed later out of the electoral necessity to secure working-class votes.|$|E
5|$|Born near Glasgow, Reid {{worked a}} number of jobs as a young adult—including wholesaler, army medic (during the Second Boer War), farmhand, lumberjack, and dentist—and immigrated to Canada in 1903. He {{involved}} himself in local politics and joined the recently formed UFA, which nominated him {{to run in the}} 1921 provincial election as its candidate in Vermilion. The UFA won the election, and Reid served in several capacities in the cabinets of Premiers Herbert Greenfield and John Edward Brownlee, where he established a reputation for competence and fiscal <b>conservatism.</b> When a sex scandal forced Brownlee from office in 1934, Reid was the caucus' unanimous choice to succeed him as Premier.|$|E
5|$|Born on 14 March 1822 in Naples, TeresaCristina {{became an}} orphan {{when her father}} died in 1830. Her mother {{is said to have}} {{neglected}} her after marrying a young officer in 1839. Historiography has long asserted that she was raised in lonely isolation, in an environment of religious superstition, intolerance and <b>conservatism.</b> It has also described Teresa Cristina as a soft and timid character, unlike her ruthless father or her impulsive mother. She has even been depicted as unassertive, and accustomed to be satisfied in whatever circumstances she found herself.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge was unopposed for the Republican {{nomination}} for Governor of Massachusetts in 1918. He and his running mate, Channing Cox, a Boston lawyer and Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, {{ran on the}} previous administration's record: fiscal <b>conservatism,</b> a vague opposition to Prohibition, support for women's suffrage, and support for American involvement in World War I. The issue of the war proved divisive, especially among Irish and German Americans. Coolidge was elected {{by a margin of}} 16,773 votes over his opponent, Richard H. Long, in the smallest margin of victory of any of his statewide campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} <b>conservatism,</b> in 1963 Brabham {{was the first}} Formula One team to use a wind tunnel to hone their designs to reduce drag and stop the cars lifting off the ground at speed. The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is possibly {{the most important factor}} in the design of modern cars. Towards the end of the 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic downforce to push the cars' tyres down harder on the track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear wings to this effect.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of World War I, as Romania {{remained}} a neutral country, Caragiale's notes record that his friend Bogdan-Pitești was acting as a political agent of the Central Powers, and that money he made available had been provided by German propaganda funds. Nevertheless, the two figures were especially close to one another during and after 1915, and, in 1916, even visited Berlin together. At the time, Caragiale also visited the Germanophile literary circle set up by Mărgărita Miller Verghy, and borrowed a reported 10,000 lei from Bogdan-Pitești, which he never returned. Caragiale's own Germanophile preferences and traditionalist <b>conservatism</b> had by then extinguished his cultural Francophilia, and rumors spread that he himself was a spy for the German Empire.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, Moelis {{announced}} that he was leaving the company, and shortly thereafter founded a new business, Moelis & Company. As he had when joining UBS, Moelis took a large team of senior UBS investment bankers. Moelis's departure was caused primarily by repeated conflict over the availability of capital from the bank's balance sheet to pursue large transactions, particularly leveraged buyouts. The bank's apparent <b>conservatism</b> would be turned on its head when large losses were reported in various mortgage securities rather than corporate loans that generated investment banking fees. After Moelis, other notable departures included investment banking co-head Jeff McDermott in early 2007 and, as the financial crisis set in, other high-profile bankers such as Oliver Sarkozy in early 2008 and Ben Lorello in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In September 1883 he went as a boarder to Field House Preparatory School in Rottingdean on {{the south}} coast of England, forty miles from Wotton. He was {{generally}} happy there, although he was shocked to encounter {{for the first time}} social snobbery and political <b>conservatism</b> which were rife among his fellow pupils. From there he moved on to the public school Charterhouse in January 1887. His academic and sporting achievements there were satisfactory, and the school encouraged his musical development. In 1888 he organised a concert in the school hall, which included a performance of his G major Piano Trio (now lost) with the composer as violinist.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} economy, the lower social classes also had to {{be integrated into the}} new body politic, although they often got few rewards from independence. The political debate seeking answers to these questions was marked by a clash—at times on the battlefield—between liberalism and <b>conservatism.</b> Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Kemp {{continued}} to be considered along with Reagan as the politician most responsible {{for the implementation of}} supply-side tax cuts and along with Steve Forbes as the political figure most responsible for their continued place in the marketplace of political ideas. He {{has been described as a}} beacon of economic <b>conservatism</b> and a hero for his urban agenda. Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies. Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who adhere to the hard right on social issues, but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy.|$|E
5|$|Lennon's former {{personal}} assistant Fred Seaman (who was earlier convicted for and admitted stealing from Lennon's personal belongings) has claimed that by this time, however, Lennon had also quietly renounced the counterculture views {{which he had}} helped promote during the 1960s and 1970s and became more aligned with <b>conservatism</b> and was supportive of Ronald Reagan, though whether he had actually aligned to a more conservative world view is disputed. Some commentators noted that Seaman's claims have low credibility, considering {{that he was a}} thief who had abused his position to steal from Lennon, and had also earlier released a book with dubious allegations about Lennon which had largely been ignored.|$|E
5|$|Limitations include that a {{consistent}} set of gases {{must be used}} which match the specific ratio model, and the specific ratio will only be relevant to a limited range of depths. As the parameters {{move away from the}} base conditions, <b>conservatism</b> will diverge, and the probability of symptomatic bubble formation will become more unpredictable. There is also the requirement for the diver to do mental arithmetic at depth to calculate the parameters of a safety-critical operation. This may be complicated by adverse circumstances or an emergency situation.|$|E
5|$|Most World War I war {{designers}} {{attempted to}} produce memorials that were, as cultural historian Jay Winter describes, noble, uplifting, tragic and endurably sad. There were various architectural styles used on memorials, {{but most were}} essentially conservative in nature, typically embracing well established styles such as classicism and embracing mainstream Christian symbolism. This <b>conservatism</b> in part resulted from the age and background of the committees that were commissioning the memorials, and also from a sense that established architectural styles, rather a potentially more transitory but fashionable style, would be more enduring and appropriate.|$|E
5|$|Some {{branches}} of feminism closely track the political leanings {{of the larger}} society, such as liberalism and <b>conservatism,</b> or focus on the environment. Liberal feminism seeks individualistic equality {{of men and women}} through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg has argued that the neoliberal shirt in Liberal feminism has led to that form of feminism being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality. Due to this she argues that Liberal Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.|$|E
