40|$|PhDThis thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the radiation characteristics of <b>corner</b> reflector <b>antennas.</b> The influence of the design parameters on the radiation characteristics are assessed using an analytical method and the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. The FDTD method for <b>corner</b> reflector <b>antennas</b> which are electrically small to medium sized antennas is developed in detail. The important subject of the Absorbing Boundary Conditions (ABCs) is studied including a study of Mur ABC and Perfectly Matched Layers. It is shown that both methods reduce the reflections from the boundaries sufficient so that the far-field radiation pattern can be computed accurately. An analytical solution to compute the far-field radiation pattern for infinite comer reflector antennas is derived and used to understand the radiation mechanisms. Based on those results, the FDTD method is used to conduct a parametric study on finite sized comer reflector antennas. Experimental antennas have been built and measured in order to verify the computational predictions. Very good agreement is reported The novel idea of a variable beam-width comer reflector antenna is developed and practical designs of such an antenna are presented. The principle is to design the comer reflector antenna such that the beam-width of the antenna can be precisely modified. Data on the gain and beam-width are presented. This has been done both by computational and by an experimental model. The influence on the performance of the comer reflector antenna when substituting the solid reflector plates by rods has been investigated. The computational predictions have been verified by measurements of an experimental antenna. Very good agreement has been achieved. III[The possibility of modifying the shape of the comer reflector antenna is investigated.

In addition, real-time multi-robot localization and path planning are achieved by using an online statis-tical filter.

40|$|In recent days, the {{microstrip}} antenna {{is getting more}} and more attention because of its small dimension, negligible weight, ease of fabrication and option to integrate with active circuits and most of all low cost to produce. The other features those the {{microstrip antenna}}s offer are ease of fabrication upon the circuit board, can be made with dimension smaller than half wavelength and wide bandwidth can be found. That is why nowadays for any industry related to antenna designing and development feels interested with microstrip antenna for its products. Most components or systems need the microstrip antenna to work for a small range (10 meter - 1000 meter). Wider beamwidth is desirable for such a small range of operation. Here in this thesis, studies are made upon aperture coupled circularly polarized microstrip antenna. Here antenna parameters and radiation pattern are studied to find out the relationship in between them. The study is done on antenna parameters such as excitation of antenna, groundplane size and shape, patch size and shape, and influence of parasitic; based on previous studied and measuring the radiation patterns with different antenna parameters.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the application of}} coplanar circuit analysis {{in the design of}} compact single-feed circularly polarised (CP) and linearly polarised (LP) microstrip patch antennas. A CP nearly square patch antenna and a CP truncated <b>corners</b> square patch <b>antenna</b> are designed. Also a LP U-slot rectangular patch antenna is designed. In order to obtain a faster computational run-time, coplanar circuit analysis and segmentation method are applied for the impedance calculations. The coupling and self impedance formulas for both rectangular and right-angled isosceles triangular segments are given. Explicit formulas for the coupling impedance between a perimeter port and a probe port, and also the probe self impedance on both of these segments are new and are derived in detail. A CP nearly square patch antenna is designed using both the cavity and equivalent circuit models. New and simple design equations are derived to determine the dimensions of the patch with a feed in any given position. For a microstrip feed offset from a corner of the patch, the area of perturbation segment is increased which reduces the effect of manufacturing errors. A simple matching network consisting of a short length of microstrip line is designed to achieve a more compact form of the matched antenna. The results obtained from both models are good agreement. A CP truncated <b>corners</b> square patch <b>antenna</b> with a microstrip feed offset from the centre is presented. In previous work the design is a feed along the centre line and the areas of the deleted segments are very small so the performance of the antenna is very sensitive to manufacturing errors. Hence an offset feed is proposed in order to increase the perturbation area and so reduce the effect of the manufacturing errors. The segmentation method is used for which a new explicit matrix input impedance formula is derived. The impedance formula requires a computer run time less than half that required by simulation (full-wave software, Ansoft Ensemble). The change in area of the perturbed segment and input impedance with the microstrip offset feed position is examined. A compromise offset feed position was chosen so as to maximise the area of the perturbation segment and achieve good impedance matching for a compact antenna structure. A LP probe feed U-slot rectangular patch is designed and the input impedance is determined. A set of initial design equation is used to produce a first-pass design. In applying segmentation method a new explicit input impedance formula for the antenna is derived. The basic system of eleven coplanar circuit equations is reduced to seven equivalent circuit equations from which the explicit impedance formula is derived. The dimensions of the patch are adjusted to give good impedance matching. In respect of computational efficiency, the run time of the new matrix input impedance formula is at least 10 times faster than is required by simulation. A thicker substrate is also used in order to improve the bandwidth. The predicted, simulated and measured results of the above three compact patch antennas are in good agreement. Mathcad programming is used to implement the design calculations of the compact patch antennas. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
