The village is further defined by a <b>concentric</b> <b>alignment</b> of necks and domes known locally as Mntǿ (peaks). Examples of such peaks include Ntø Maleta (2740m), Ntø Mangua (2710m), Ntø Tiahchia, etc.|$|E
40|$|Diffusion of {{multivalent}} metallic ions into {{aqueous solution}} of rigid, negatively charged macromolecules of high concentration {{is an effective}} approach to prepare macroscopically anisotropic hydrogels. However, the mechanism for superstructure formation is still not clear. By observing the mixing process of a small drop of CaCl 2 solution with solution of a rigid polyanion, poly(2, 2 ′- disulfonyl- 4, 4 ′-benzidine terephthalamide) (PBDT), under the polarizing optical microscope, the diffusion profile of Ca 2 + and detailed anisotropic gelation process of PBDT are revealed. Diffusion of Ca 2 + into the surrounding PBDT solution immediately induces the formation of physical liquid crystalline (LC) gel with <b>concentric</b> <b>alignment</b> of PBDT. The thickness d of this region increases with diffusion time t, obeying the diffusion law d ∼ t 1 / 2. A thin ring of constant width (∼ 100 μm) with radial alignment of PBDT appears at the diffusion/reaction front, ahead of the <b>concentric</b> <b>alignment</b> region. When two drops of CaCl 2 fluxes meet, their outside thin rings {{interact with each other}} and the PBDT in this contacting region orients ± 45 ° to the midline of the two drops. From these observations, we rationally contend that the internal stress induced by the contraction of gel phase is responsible for the ion diffusion-induced PBDT orientations. This structure formation mechanism gives insight into other diffusion-directed anisotropic gelation systems...|$|E
40|$|A megacrystal granodiorite, {{occurring}} in a pluton in the Monterey peninsula of California, is gradational south to quartz monzonite {{and then to}} tonalite and trondhjemite and southeast to granodiorite and then to tonalite. A primary magmatic origin for the pluton is indicated by normally zoned plagioclase crystals and by dikes that extend into biotite-hornblende quartz diorite southeast of Point Lobos and into biotite schists south of Carmel Valley Village. Plagioclase in the tonalite lacks zonation, but toward the northwest, the plagioclase becomes increasingly zoned in the megacrystal granodiorite. Therefore, the shallowest {{part of the original}} pluton must have been near Monterey. The tonalite is undeformed but progressively becomes cataclastically broken from the southeast toward the northwest. In less than one kilometer, broken plagioclase crystals are increasingly penetrated and gradually replaced by microcline, converting the tonalite into granodiorite. K-metasomatism first creates tiny microcline islands and veins in interiors of broken plagioclase crystals. Then, the microcline grows and engulfs plagioclase remnants and other groundmass minerals. Eventually, the microcline becomes megacrysts, some as large as 4 cm long. Wartlike myrmekite commonly borders the microcline. In formerly strongly-deformed zones, the microcline megacrysts locally have parallel alignment. Some megacrysts show <b>concentric</b> zonation and <b>alignments</b> of tiny plagioclase inclusions parallel to possible crystal faces of the microcline. Thus, the four facies in the pluton, tonalite, quartz monzonite, granodiorite, and megacrystal granodiorite, which seem to have formed by magmatic differentiation, are a result of cataclasis of a former trondhjemite/tonalite pluton in which some of the plagioclase has been replaced progressively by microcline...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} developed bioengineered three-dimensional internal anal sphincter (IAS) rings from circular smooth muscle cells isolated from rabbit and human IAS. We provide {{proof of concept}} that bioengineered mouse IAS rings are neovascularized upon implantation into mice of the same strain and maintain <b>concentric</b> smooth muscle <b>alignment,</b> phenotype, and IAS functionality. Rings were bioengineered by using smooth muscle cells from the IAS of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Bioengineered mouse IAS rings were implanted subcutaneously on the dorsum of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice along with a microosmotic pump delivering fibroblast growth factor- 2. The mice remained healthy {{during the period of}} implantation, showing no external signs of rejection. Mice were killed 28 days postsurgery and implanted IAS rings were harvested. IAS rings showed muscle attachment, neovascularization, healthy color, and no external signs of infection or inflammation. Assessment of force generation on harvested IAS rings showed the following: 1) spontaneous basal tone was generated in the absence of external stimulation; 2) basal tone was relaxed by vasoactive intestinal peptide, nitric oxide donor, and nifedipine; 3) acetylcholine and phorbol dibutyrate elicited rapid-rising, dose-dependent, sustained contractions repeatedly over 30 min without signs of muscle fatigue; and 4) magnitudes of potassium chloride-induced contractions were 100 % of peak maximal agonist-induced contractions. Our preliminary results confirm the proof of concept that bioengineered rings are neovascularized upon implantation. Harvested rings maintain smooth muscle alignment and phenotype. Our physiological studies confirm that implanted rings maintain 1) overall IAS physiology and develop basal tone, 2) integrity of membrane ionic characteristics, and 3) integrity of membrane associated intracellular signaling transduction pathways for contraction and relaxation by responding to cholinergic, nitrergic, and VIP-ergic stimulation. IAS smooth muscle tissue could thus be bioengineered for the purpose of implantation to serve as a potential graft therapy for dysfunctional internal anal sphincter in fecal incontinence...|$|R
