30|$|The <b>Cox</b> proportionalhazard <b>model</b> <b>Cox</b> (1972) is {{a common}} and {{familiar}} choice among investigators to examine longitudinal time to event data. However, there is concern over the validity of <b>Cox</b> <b>models</b> {{in the presence of}} time-varying covariates (Kalbfleisch and Prentice 2002). It has been suggested that multi-state models can be used as an alternative to <b>Cox</b> <b>models</b> to address some of these limitations (Cortese and Andersen 2010).|$|R
40|$|Statistical models {{such as the}} semi-parametric <b>Cox's</b> <b>model</b> {{allow to}} analyse failure time data in {{prospective}} studies. One key assumption of these models is the independence between observations. In fact, this assumption is not fulfilled {{in the case of}} clustered samples, where measurements on subjects (individual level) belonging to a same group (cluster level) may be correlated. Simulations have been managed to study the estimation accuracy and test power of four models for correlated survival data: naive <b>Cox's</b> <b>model,</b> marginal <b>Cox's</b> <b>model,</b> <b>Cox's</b> <b>model</b> including fixed cluster effect and frailty <b>Cox's</b> <b>model.</b> The most important results are the following: (i) the frailty model presented the best fit and was able to correctly hold severe censoring, e. g., until 60 %, (ii) gamma and normal distribution assumption for the frailty led to similar estimation and test results for the regression coefficient but not for the variance estimate of the frailty and (iii) the benefits of using models taking into account the correlation were more important {{in the case of a}} small number of big clusters than in presence of many little clusters...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to allowing time-varying covariates (i.e., predictors), the <b>Cox</b> <b>model</b> may {{be generalized to}} time-varying coefficients as well. That is, the proportional effect of a treatment may vary with time; e.g. a drug may be very effective if administered within one month of morbidity, and become less effective as time goes on. The hypothesis of no change with time (stationarity) of the coefficient may then be tested. Details and software (R package) are available in Martinussen and Scheike (2006). The application of the <b>Cox</b> <b>model</b> with time-varying covariates is considered in reliability mathematics.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cox</b> {{regression}} <b>model</b> has {{an important}} and glaring place in survival analysis. The key assumption is proportional hazards and violation of this assumption can invalidate outcomes of a study.

The focus of this analysis {{is the effect of}} major depressive disorder on the risk of developing bipolar disorder in order to more easily demonstrate the statistical comparability between <b>Cox</b> <b>models</b> and multi-state models.|$|R

The weight of the penalty is optimised by using a REML type-algorithm. Models with time varying effects of the covariates can also be fitted. Some of the covariates may {{be allowed to be}} fixed and thus not controlled by the penalty. There are three different penalty functions, ridge, dynamic and weighted dynamic.

Regression models, including the <b>Cox</b> <b>model,</b> generally give more reliable results with normally-distributed variables. For this example use a log transform.
