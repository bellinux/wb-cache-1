5|$|Dialogi and Summa Technologiae (1964) are Lem's {{two most}} famous {{philosophical}} texts. The Summa is notable {{for being a}} unique analysis of prospective social, cybernetic, and biological advances; in this work, Lem discusses philosophical implications of technologies that were <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> realm of science fiction at the time, but are gaining importance today—for instance, virtual reality and nanotechnology.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, fuel {{stocks were}} used by the armies, and were {{unavailable}} to farmers. This allowed horses to remain a key aspect of agriculture and transportation {{until the end of}} the war. After the war, farmers rapidly mechanized their operations. The Auxois and other draft breeds were quickly abandoned in favor of machines, and population numbers began to fall in the early 1950s and collapsed <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s. By the 1970s, the Auxois had almost disappeared, although many villages in the breed's homeland retained a small number of mares for traditional competitions.|$|E
5|$|Phu's {{excessive}} {{preoccupation with}} secrecy, however, doomed the effort from the beginning. Operational planning was limited {{only to a}} few trusted subordinates who had either contributed to or knew about it. Staff work was non-existent. The {{chief of staff of}} II Corps, for example, admitted that he was <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark about the planned abandonment of Pleiku and Kon Tum. Command of the convoy itself was handed over to the commander of the II Corps Rangers.|$|E

5|$|Using a Magyar {{invasion}} in {{the lands of}} the neighbouring Slavs in 896 as a casus belli, Simeon headed against the Magyars together with his Pecheneg allies, defeating them <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Southern Buh and making them leave Etelköz forever and settle in Pannonia. Following {{the defeat of the}} Magyars, Simeon finally released the Byzantine prisoners in exchange for Bulgarians captured in 895.|$|E
5|$|Carthage, {{the second}} largest city in the empire, was lost along with much of North Africa in 439 AD to the Vandals, {{and the fate of}} Rome seemed sealed. By 476 AD, what {{remained}} of the Empire was <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of federated Germanic troops and when they revolted, led by Odoacer and deposed the Emperor Romulus Augustus there was nobody to stop them. Odoacer happened to hold the part of the Empire around Italy and Rome but other parts of the Empire were ruled by Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Franks, Alans and others. The Empire in the West had fallen, and its remnant in Italy was no longer Roman in nature. The Eastern Roman Empire and the Goths continued to fight over Rome and the surrounding area for many years, though by this point Rome's importance was primarily symbolic.|$|E
5|$|Chronologically, it is {{difficult}} to establish guidelines that illustrate the evolution of Gaudí's style faithfully. Although he moved on from his initially historicist approach to immerse himself <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> modernista movement which arose so vigorously in the last third of the 19th century in Catalonia, before finally attaining his personal, organic style, this process did not consist of clearly defined stages with obvious boundaries: rather, at every stage there are reflections of all the earlier ones, as he gradually assimilated and surpassed them. Among the best descriptions of Gaudí's work was made by his disciple and biographer Joan Bergós, according to plastic and structural criteria. Bergós establishes five periods in Gaudí's productions: preliminary period, mudéjar-morisco (Moorish/mudéjar art), emulated Gothic, naturalist and expressionist, and organic synthesis.|$|E

5|$|NWOBHM bands {{had been}} touring {{steadily}} in the United States, {{but had not}} yet received enough FM radio airplay there to make a significant impression on American charts. Def Leppard remedied that, releasing Pyromania {{at the beginning of}} 1983, an album with a more melodic and FM-friendly approach in comparison with the more aggressive sound of their earlier music. The band's goal of reaching a wider international audience, which included many female fans, was attained <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US, where Pyromania peaked at No.2 on the Billboard 200 chart behind Michael Jackson's Thriller. Thanks to a string of hit singles and the heavy rotation of their music videos on the recently launched MTV, the album had sold more than six millions copies in the US by 1984 and made Def Leppard superstars. The overwhelming international success of Pyromania induced both American and British bands to follow Def Leppard's example, giving a decisive boost to the more commercial and melodic glam metal and heralding the end of the NWOBHM.|$|E
5|$|The hindlimbs of Patagosaurus {{are based}} on scant material, some femora, a tibia, and a few nondescript pedal bones. Two femora come from an adult, with a single {{additional}} bone known from the juvenile. The adult femora are proportionately different from the juvenile, being mostly straighter and more ovoid in cross-section. The femoral head is well preserved, although lacking the greater trochanter. The distal end is rather symmetrical when viewed from behind, with two similarly sized condylar surfaces. In the juvenile, the fourth trochanter is <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proximal end. The tibia has a well-developed cnemial crest, and is also short and robust. The surface that would have articulated with the astragalus in life has the anterior half raised, and the posterior half lowered.|$|E

Today, the quarter houses the physics buildings, the tall main chemistry building, visible from afar, the famous Institute for Macromolecular Chemistry at the Hermann-Staudinger-Haus, various other science buildings, and the renowned preclinical institutes of the Faculty of Medicine.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{in about}} the 4th century, Japan became {{increasingly}} influenced by the Chinese judicial system, and gradually adopted a system of different punishments for different crimes, including the death penalty. However, beginning in the Nara period, cruel punishments and the death penalty were used less and less, probably {{as a result of}} the influence of Buddhist teachings, and the death penalty was abolished <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Heian period. The death penalty was not used for the next 300 years, until the Genpei War.|$|E

Through the night and the raid of the next day, the XIII Corps began withdrawing. It would retreat seven miles to positions being prepared at the Wadi, a tributary of the Tigris. On 9 January, the Tigris Corps would occupy the left bank positions.|$|E
25|$|This {{slow pace}} of reform was met with stiff {{resistance}} from provincial governors and broke down <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1990s {{as a result of}} the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Deng's Southern Tour of 1992, designed by the ailing but influential leader as a means to reinstate his economic reform agenda. On the tour, Deng criticized the leftist hardliners that had gained power following the protests, and praised entrepreneurship and other market-driven policies. Initially ignored by Beijing, the Chinese Politburo eventually sided with Deng and economic reforms again gained prominence.|$|E
25|$|One {{possible}} {{solution to this}} anchor point placement problem is to remove the histogram binning grid <b>completely.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> left figure below, a kernel (represented by the grey lines) is centred {{at each of the}} 50 data points above. The result of summing these kernels is given on the right figure, which is a kernel density estimate. The most striking difference between kernel density estimates and histograms is that the former are easier to interpret since they do not contain artifices induced by a binning grid.|$|E
