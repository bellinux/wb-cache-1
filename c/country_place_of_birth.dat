40|$|Belgian and the Dutch {{societies}} show many similarities but {{differ with}} regard to the organisation of maternity care. The Dutch way <b>of</b> giving <b>birth</b> is well-known for its high percentage <b>of</b> home <b>births</b> and its low medical intervention rate. In contrast, home births in Belgium are uncommon and the medical model is taken for granted. We expect that diverging models of maternity care give rise to different patterns of expectations and experiences. This quantitative comparative study took place in Belgian and Dutch hospitals and independent midwifery practices. Two questionnaires were completed by 611 women, one at 30 weeks of pregnancy and one within the first 2 weeks after childbirth, at home or in a hospital. Expectations about childbirth and the experience of childbirth have been assessed with the Wijma delivery expectancy/experience questionnaire enabling repeated measurement. A linear mixed model, with three fixed factors (time, <b>country</b> and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth),</b> shows that expectations and experiences diverge. Dutch women have more negative expectations and experiences compared to Belgian women. Women who had a home birth had only slightly more optimistic expectations compared to women who had a hospital birth, but they rated their experiences as more positive...|$|R

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the effects of inward foreign investments 2 ̆ 7 characteristics on the nature and intensity of the attitudes of host nationals in an advanced country. Specifically, interest {{was focused on the}} following aspects of inward foreign investments in the U. S.; (a) national origin of investments (countries included are Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, England, West Germany, Holland, and Japan); (b) types of foreign investment operation (types of investment included are farming, manufacturing, petroleum, real estate, and retailing); (c) foreign investors 2 ̆ 7 forms of entry into the U. S. (forms covered are foreign de novo and foreign acquisition); and (d) extent of foreign ownership (using the 25 and 75 percentages of equity ownership). In addition, the study also investigated any variations in the attitudes prevalent among the host nationals toward the four aspects of foreign investments, based on demographic variables. The demographic variables included were: age, religion, ethnic background, personal contact with particular foreigners, overseas travel experience in general and to specific <b>countries,</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> based on geographic and level of income regions, geographic mobility, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> work based on geographic and level of income regions, occupation, education, and political philosophy. The objective here also includes, as a corollary, an examination of the existence of stereotype, prejudice, and ethnocentric tendencies. ^ Concepts from social psychology, sociology, and marketing provided the theoretical framework for this study. The method used to measure attitude was adopted from the theoretical models of affective-cognitive consistency formulated by Rosengerg and Fishbein. In an international investment context, these models suggest that a host national 2 ̆ 7 s attitude about investment will be a function of the relationship between an investment and its attributes and the importance of these attributes to the individual in his acceptance decision. ^ The study utilized primary data collected from 397 industrial and economic advisors in 32 states of the Union. Subjects were requested to complete a questionnaire designed to measure their attitudes on nine attributes, with some variation in their numbers and phrasings, toward the four sets of foreign investment characteristics. The questionnaire also consisted of three attitude statements designed to measure respondents 2 ̆ 7 international orientations and a section to collect demographic data. ^ The findings of this research study indicated that subjects, as a whole, appeared to be differentiating the value of inward foreign investments from the five nationalities and in the five sectors of the economy. There was also a general significant agreement in favor of the forms of de novo and portfolio investments over foreign 2 ̆ 2 take-over 2 ̆ 2 and direct investments. However, in further analysis of the effect of demographic variables, the relationships were altered to a certain extent by most of the variables. The results pointed out that the incidence and intensity of negative attitudes (stereotype, prejudice, and ethnocentric views) varies, to a significant extent, by differences in sub-groups 2 ̆ 7 demographic characteristics. ^ A number of implications were also revealed by the study and discussed in the dissertation. These were related to 2 ̆ 2 theory of host national attitudes toward foreign investments, 2 ̆ 2 present and potential foreign investors in the U. S., and U.

ABSTRACT: All acts of terrorism are liable to be criticized severely. Terrorism is considered by UNO in its all Millennium Development Goals (MDG) reports as a major stumbling block to the all-round development of humanity. But terrorist activities do not take birth in one day. These activities {{are the result of}} a strong ideology which by hook or by crook considers terror activities as legal and just on one hand and promotes them through various Medias particularity through religion on the other hand. Wahhabism is one of such an important ideology in this context. Today many strategic and geopolitical analysts are busy to know how the ideology of Wahhabism is helping in promoting the global terrorism. The ideology of Wahhabism is directly promoted by Saudi Arabia’s government as the said <b>country</b> is a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> this ideology as well as the founder of this ideology ‘Muhammad Abdul Wahhab’.

40|$|Background.  Congenital {{cytomegalovirus}} (CMV) infection {{can cause}} severe birth defects. The majority {{of children with}} congenital CMV are born to CMV-seropositive women; however, transmission from mother to fetus and resulting defects {{are more likely to}} occur when mothers experience seroconversion during pregnancy. The objective {{of this study was to}} provide a population-based estimate of CMV seropositivity and to identify factors that correlate with the detection of CMV-immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies. Methods.  Cytomegalovirus-specific IgG antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 13 876 serum samples from children and adolescents (aged 1 – 17 years). Cytomegalovirus seroprevalence was correlated with children's age, gender, migration background, <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth,</b> socioeconomic status, breast feeding, daycare attendance, order and number of siblings, and residence in East versus West Germany. Results.  Age-adjusted seroprevalence was 27. 4 % (95 % confidence interval, 25. 8 – 29. 0). Cytomegalovirus seroprevalence increased with age (21. 5 % at ages 1 – 2; 32. 0 % at ages 14 – 17). Cytomegalovirus seropositivity was significantly associated with migration background, <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth,</b> and (among migrants only) with low socioeconomic status. Risk factors for CMV acquisition included the <b>birth</b> order <b>of</b> siblings, breastfeeding, early daycare attendance, and living in East Germany. Conclusions.  In Germany, CMV seroprevalence increases with age, irrespective of gender. These data highlight risk factors associated with seroprevalence and help to identify a target age for the application of a CMV vaccine...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} food inevitably interferes on the {{nutritional}} and organic balance through {{the quality and}} the amount of certain nutrients. In addition, food contributes to the maintenance of cultural identities because food choices identify their fundamental aspects and has far-reaching implications on the availability of resources, with an inevitable impact on the fate of future generations. From this background comes the concept of “ethical food” that involves the understanding and awareness of food origin from a holistic point of view and therefore provides a useful tool to make responsible food choices. In the case of food of animal origin, this choice aims to ensure a farming animal welfare, the guarantee of human health and the environmental protection. In Europe, one of the tools to achieve this goal is the food labelling, whereby the information is clear, understandable and transparent, in accordance with specific Community rules. The Regulation (EU) No 1169 / 2011 set out the principles, the requirements and the responsibilities, to provide an accurate and understandable information about food. On April 1 2015 the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1337 / 2013 entered into force, laying down additional rules for the labelling of pork, with the goal to increase transparency by providing precise information on the origin of swine products. It will be compulsory for food business operators who will indicate, on the label of the marketed meat, the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> animals’ rearing and slaughtering. In case of meat from animals born, raised and slaughtered in the same <b>country,</b> the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> will instead appear on a voluntary basis. A full and transparent information is the first step of the ´´right to know´´ way, assumed as an awareness passage to consumers able to make free but responsible choices. This option is essential for a full guarantee food policy inside the protection of free trade and can be considered a transition from a single rules legislation (food legislation) to a regulation systematic approach (food law) ...|$|R
40|$|When he was seventy-two Norman Tindale {{published}} his {{opinion that the}} Pitjantjatjara people of the south-eastern Western Desert were divided into patrilineal descent groups or clans. Their members, by <b>birth,</b> shared inheritance <b>of</b> a particular totem and its locality, and therefore possessed the same territory (Tindale 1972 : 223). In this paper I examine in detail his own very substantial 1933 field data on these people, {{as well as that}} of several other anthropologists who worked in the same region from 1930 onwards. These primary sources reveal that there were no descent groups, whether patrilineal or matrilineal, at all, in this part of the Western Desert.

40|$|Hispanic {{individuals}} {{trace their}} ancestry to countries {{that were previously}} under Spanish rule, including Mexico, large parts of Central and South America, and some Caribbean islands. Most—but not all—Hispanics have variable proportions of European, Amerindian, and African ancestry. Hispanics are diverse with regard to many factors, including racial ancestry, country of origin, area of residence, socioeconomic status, education, and access to health care. Recent findings {{suggest that there is}} marked variation in the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of asthma in Hispanics in the United States and in Hispanic America. The reasons for differences in asthma and asthma morbidity among and within Hispanic subgroups are poorly understood but are likely due to the interaction between yet-unidentified genetic variants and other factors, including environmental tobacco smoke exposure, obesity, allergen exposure, and availability of health care. Barriers to optimal management of asthma in Hispanics in the United States and in Hispanic America include inadequate access to health care, suboptimal use of antiinflammatory medications, and lack of reference values for spirometric measures of lung function in many subgroups (e. g., Puerto Ricans). Future studies of asthma in Hispanics should include large samples of subgroups that are well characterized with regard to self-reported ethnicity, <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth,</b> area <b>of</b> residence, and indicators of socioeconomic status. Because Hispanics are disproportionately represented among the poor in the United States, implementation of adequate access to health care and social reforms (e. g., improving housing conditions) would likely {{have a major impact on}} reducing asthma morbidity in this population...|$|R
40|$|Two {{trends in}} {{international}} migration flows have {{attracted much attention}} recently: (i) the growing feminisation of migration flows; and (ii) the increasing selectivity of migration towards the highly skilled, {{which in turn has}} given rise to renewed concerns about the brain drain 9 ̆ 4 consequences for the sending countries. The two issues have not been considered jointly, however, mainly {{due to the lack of}} relevant data. This paper addresses this shortcoming by looking at the gender dimension of the brain drain, based on a new comparable data set that has been collected by the OECD and which allows us to identify people by <b>country</b> <b>of</b> residence, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth,</b> gender and level of education. The evidence summarized in this paper shows that female migration to OECD countries has been increasing significantly in recent decades, so that migrant stocks are now more or less gender-balanced. A more surprising result is that this is also true for the highly skilled. Taking into account the fact that women still face an unequal access to tertiary education in many less developed countries, it appears that women are over-represented in the brain drain. This result is reinforced by econometric estimates showing that emigration of highly skilled women is higher, the poorer is their country of origin. This effect is also observed for men but to a lesser extent. It is not observed, however, at lower educational levels, where the traditional migration hump is identifiable. Econometric estimates also report a negative impact of emigration of highly skilled women on three key education and health indicators: infant mortality, under- 5 mortality and secondary school enrolment rate by gender. These results raise concerns about a potentially significant negative impact of the female brain drain on the poorest countries...|$|R

The proposed hypothesis was that players born {{earlier in the year}} would be over-represented compared to those born later in their age band. A secondary hypothesis was that access to the ETP would be independent <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth.</b> Methods: The dates and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> all elite youth footballers (n = 1936) selected onto the ETP since its inception were examined. χ 2 tests were used to establish if the dates <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> differed from the expected population distribution.
