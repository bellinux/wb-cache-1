5|$|The Democrats' success <b>continued</b> <b>down</b> the ballot. Meehan {{did not run}} for re-election, and {{the race}} for county sheriff pitted two {{incumbent}} city councilmen against {{each other for the}} job: Democrat William M. Lennox and Republican Cornelius S. Deegan, Jr. The office of sheriff was another holdover county office. The sheriff, whose job differed from that of the chief of police, was the chief law enforcement officer of the court. Lennox came out ahead, and would hold the job for the next twenty years.|$|E
5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Virginia Tech in {{possession}} of the ball and facing second down on Stanford's 49-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Taylor completed a 10-yard throw to wide receiver Marcus Davis for a first down. Tech's drive <b>continued</b> <b>down</b> the field, with running back Darren Evans receiving {{the ball on the}} majority of the plays. A 5-yard false start penalty against Virginia Tech was offset by a pass interference penalty two plays later by Stanford. Tech penetrated to the Stanford 10-yard line, but was stopped for no gain, then a loss, on two consecutive running plays. On third down, Taylor was pressured by the Stanford defense, scrambled out of the pocket, and threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to running back David Wilson an instant before Taylor stepped out of bounds. The score and subsequent extra point gave Tech its only lead of the game, 9–7, with 10:22 remaining before halftime.|$|E

5|$|Earlier that afternoon, as Meade {{realized}} {{the folly of}} Sickles's movement, he ordered Hancock to send a division from the II Corps to reinforce the III Corps. Hancock sent the 1st Division under Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell from its reserve position behind Cemetery Ridge. It arrived at about 6 p.m. and three brigades, under Cols. Samuel K. Zook, Patrick Kelly (the Irish Brigade), and Edward E. Cross moved forward; the fourth brigade, under Col. John R. Brooke, was in reserve. Zook and Kelly drove the Confederates from Stony Hill, and Cross cleared the Wheatfield, pushing Kershaw's men back {{to the edge of}} Rose Woods. Both Zook and Cross were mortally wounded in leading their brigades through these assaults, as was Confederate Semmes. When Cross's men had exhausted their ammunition, Caldwell ordered Brooke to relieve them. By this time, however, the Union position in the Peach Orchard had collapsed (see next section), and Wofford's assault <b>continued</b> <b>down</b> the Wheatfield Road, taking Stony Hill and flanking the Union forces in the Wheatfield. Brooke's brigade in Rose Woods had to retreat in some disorder. Sweitzer's brigade was sent in to delay the Confederate assault, and they did this effectively in vicious hand-to-hand combat. The Wheatfield changed hands once again.|$|E

Jesse Jackson and Roger Toussaint were among {{the leaders of the}} march. In a poll, the majority of New Yorkers believed that the protest would result in a backlash. However, very few stores closed for the boycott. Organizers formed a human chain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1870s, prospectors venturing west from Leadville {{in search of}} silver veins crossed the Continental Divide at Independence Pass and <b>continued</b> <b>down</b> the Roaring Fork Valley to {{establish}} several mining camps. One of them, at {{the confluence of the}} Roaring Fork and Castle Creek, became the area's pre-eminent settlement by 1879. At first it was called Ute City, after the local Native American tribe, but by the early 1880s it had been renamed Aspen, after the trees abundant in the area.|$|E

25|$|The FitzAlans also {{motivated}} their vassals {{and allies}} {{to follow their}} example in making grants. This was especially so of the Lestranges, and most especially of the Knockin branch of the family. Their interest and protection <b>continued</b> <b>down</b> the centuries, with repeated grants of land and loans. In 1342 Roger Lestrange, Baron Strange of Knockin, granted the church at Hanmer to fund a perpetual chantry at the abbey, {{although it was not}} until about 1426 that practical and legal difficulties were overcome to establish the chantry.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{travelled}} to Forcett Village, arriving {{some time}} around 11:00a.m. He <b>continued</b> <b>down</b> to Port Arthur and was seen driving into Seascape down the Arthur Highway around 11:45a.m. He {{stopped at the}} Seascape guest accommodation site {{that his father had}} wanted to purchase, owned by David and Noelene Martin. Bryant went inside and fired several shots, then gagged David Martin and stabbed him. Witnesses testified to different numbers of shots fired at this time. It was stated in court that it was believed that this was the time that Bryant killed the Martins, his first two victims.|$|E
25|$|Another vehicle {{then drove}} down the road, {{carrying}} four people. It was not until they were almost adjacent to Bryant that they realised {{he was carrying a}} gun. Bryant shot at the car, smashing the windscreen. Douglas Horner was wounded by pieces of the windscreen. The car proceeded ahead where White and Wanders tried to get in, but Horner did not realise the situation and drove on. When they saw that White had been shot, they came back and picked them up. Both parties then <b>continued</b> <b>down</b> to a local establishment called the Fox and Hound, where they called police.|$|E

25|$|As Mason and {{his team}} were digging, they {{uncovered}} eight skeletons, {{all of which were}} lying face down and parallel to one another. Six of these skeletons were identified as old or mature males, while the other two were unsexed. Among their grave goods were ceramics, stone projectile points, celts, and a winged agate pendant. Skeleton 4 had a cache of stone points at its feet, a cache of gold beads and five repoussé gold plaques, which lay atop the individual. Intact vessels and ceramic sherds lined the north and south ends of the burial, which <b>continued</b> <b>down</b> into the second level.|$|E
25|$|One {{police officer}} then {{drove down the}} road past Seascape and past the {{disabled}} car of Linda White. He looked {{at it for a}} moment and <b>continued</b> <b>down</b> to the Fox and Hound. After he informed his partner, they proceeded back to Seascape. At about 2:00p.m., they were back at Seascape and could see the BMW on fire. At some point, they were fired upon, and eventually had to hide in a ditch {{at the side of the}} road. Bryant fired at them whenever they tried to escape, and they were not able to move from that position for many hours.|$|E
25|$|From Nauplia William and Geoffrey of Villehardouin {{made their}} way north to Corinth, and thence {{along the coast of}} the gulf to Patras, where they took the city and the castle too. They <b>continued</b> <b>down</b> the coast to Andravida, where the local archons and the populace came out to meet them, priests {{carrying}} the cross and icons. The Greeks made obeisance to William as their new ruler. The fall of Andravida also meant the easy occupation of Elis. Wherever William met no resistance, he recognized the rights of the Greeks to their lands, customs, and privileges.|$|E

25|$|Linguistic and {{historical}} records indicate a possible southern origin of Siouan peoples, with migrations {{over a thousand}} years ago from North Carolina and Virginia to Ohio. Some peoples <b>continued</b> <b>down</b> the Ohio River to the Mississippi River and up the Missouri River, and others across Ohio to Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota, home of the Dakota. Ohio Valley Siouan (Southeastern Siouan) is a group of related Siouan languages, which included the Ofo language, Biloxi language, and the Tutelo language. The Tutelo language was a group of mutually intelligible dialects spoken by the Tutelo, Monacan, Manahoac and Nahyssan confederacies, and Occaneechi in what is now Virginia and West Virginia.|$|E
25|$|The King of Leinster, Diarmait Mac Murchada, {{after his}} exile by Ruaidhrí, {{enlisted the help}} of Strongbow, the Earl of Pembroke, to conquer Dublin. Following Mac Murrough's death, Strongbow {{declared}} himself King of Leinster after gaining control of the city. In response to Strongbow's successful invasion, King Henry II of England reaffirmed his sovereignty by mounting a larger invasion in 1171 and pronounced himself Lord of Ireland. Around this time, the county of the City of Dublin was established along with certain liberties adjacent to the city proper. This <b>continued</b> <b>down</b> to 1840 when the barony of Dublin City was separated from the barony of Dublin. Since 2001, both baronies have been redesignated the City of Dublin.|$|E
25|$|Initial limited mosque {{availability}} {{meant that}} prayers {{were conducted in}} small rooms of council flats until the 1980s when more and larger facilities became available. Some synagogues and community buildings were turned into mosques and existing mosques began to expand their buildings. This process has <b>continued</b> <b>down</b> {{to the present day}} with the East London Mosque recently expanding into a large former car park where the London Muslim Centre is now used for prayers, recreational facilities and housing. Most people regard themselves as part of the ummah, and their identity is based on their religion rather than their ethnic group. Cultural aspects of a 'Bengali Islam' are seen as superstition and as un-Islamic.|$|E
