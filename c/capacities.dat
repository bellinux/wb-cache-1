5|$|How life {{originated}} from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent {{hypothesis is that}} life {{first appeared in the}} form of short self-replicating RNA polymers. On this view, life may have come into existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. The fitness of an early RNA replicator would likely have been a function of adaptive <b>capacities</b> that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive <b>capacities</b> could logically have been: (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) the capacity to avoid decay, and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources. These <b>capacities</b> would have been determined initially by the folded configurations (including those configurations with ribozyme activity) of the RNA replicators that, in turn, would have been encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences.|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} a <b>capacity</b> market is needed in most {{restructured}} electricity markets, and present a design that avoids the many problems found in the early <b>capacity</b> markets. The proposed locational <b>capacity</b> market pays suppliers based on their demonstrated ability to supply energy or reserves in shortage hours—hours {{in which there is}} a shortage of operating reserves. Thus, only supply that contributes to reliability is rewarded. The <b>capacity</b> price responds to market conditions. When <b>capacity</b> is scarce the <b>capacity</b> price is high; when <b>capacity</b> is plentiful the <b>capacity</b> price is low or zero. Market power in the <b>capacity</b> market is addressed by setting the <b>capacity</b> price based on actual <b>capacity,</b> rather than bid <b>capacity,</b> so generators cannot increase the <b>capacity</b> price by withholding supply.

Thus, a supplier does not have an incentive to create real-time shortages—the high shortage price resulting from a shortage is subtracted from the <b>capacity</b> price, so there is no net gain from the high price.
