2500|$|The reactor has two {{independent}} cooling circuits, each having four main <b>circulating</b> <b>pumps</b> (three operating, one standby). The cooling water is fed to the reactor through lower water lines {{to a common}} pressure header (one for each cooling circuit), which is split to 22 group distribution headers, each feeding 38–41 pressure channels through the core, where the feedwater boils. The mixture of steam and water {{is led by the}} upper steam lines, one for each pressure channel, from the reactor top to the steam separators, pairs of thick horizontal drums located in side compartments above the reactor top; each has [...] diameter, [...] length, wall thickness of , and weighs [...] Steam, with steam quality of about 15%, is taken {{from the top of the}} separators by two steam collectors per separator, combined, and led to two turbogenerators in the turbine hall, then to condensers, reheated to , and pumped by the condensate pumps to deaerators, where remains of gaseous phase and corrosion-inducing gases are removed. The resulting feedwater is led to the steam separators by feedwater pumps and mixed with water from them at their outlets. From the bottom of the steam separators, the feedwater is led by 12 downpipes (from each separator) to the suction headers of the main circulation pumps, and back into the reactor. There is an ion exchange system included in the loop to remove impurities from the feedwater.|$|E

50|$|A solar {{controller}} is {{an electronic}} device {{that controls the}} <b>circulating</b> <b>pump</b> in a solar hot water system to harvest as much heat {{as possible from the}} solar panels and protect the system from overheating. The basic job of the controller is to turn the <b>circulating</b> <b>pump</b> on when there is heat available in the panels, moving the working fluid through the panels to the heat exchanger at the thermal store. Heat is available whenever the temperature of the solar panel is greater than the temperature of the water in the heat exchanger. Overheat protection is achieved by turning the pump off when the store reaches its maximum temperature and sometimes cooling the store by turning the pump on when the store is hotter than the panels.|$|R

50|$|At 1:23:04 a.m., the {{experiment}} began. Four {{of the main}} <b>circulating</b> <b>pumps</b> (MCP) were active; of the eight total, six are normally active during regular operation. The steam to the turbines was shut off, beginning a run-down of the turbine generator. The diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads; the generators were to have completely picked up the MCPs' power needs by 01:23:43. In the interim, the power for the MCPs was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down. As {{the momentum of the}} turbine generator decreased, so did the power it produced for the pumps. The water flow rate decreased, leading to increased formation of steam voids (bubbles) in the core.|$|E
50|$|Air lock {{problems}} {{often occur}} {{when one is}} trying to recommission a system {{after it has been}} deliberately (for servicing) or accidentally emptied. For example, a central heating system using a circulating pump to pump water through radiators. When filling such a system, air is trapped in the radiators. This air has to be vented using screw valves built into the radiators. Depending on the pipe layout - if there are any upside down 'U's in the circuit - {{it will be necessary to}} vent the highest point(s). If not, air lock may stop flow through that part of the circuit completely. Note that <b>circulating</b> <b>pumps</b> usually do not generate enough pressure to overcome air locks.|$|E

50|$|In {{parabolic}} trough plants, copper is {{specified in the}} solar collector field (power cables, signals, earthing, electrical motors); steam cycle (water pumps, condenser fans, cabling to consumption points, control signal and sensors, motors), electricity generators (alternator, transformer), and storage systems (<b>circulating</b> <b>pumps,</b> cabling to consumption points). A 50 MW plant with 7.5 hours of storage contains approximately 196 tonnes of copper, of which 131,500 kg are in cables and 64,700 kg are in various equipment (generators, transformers, mirrors, and motors). This translates to about 3.9 tonnes/MW, or, in other terms, 1.2 tonnes/GWh/year. A plant {{of the same size}} without storage can have 20% less copper in the solar field and 10% less in the electronic equipment. A 100 MW plant will have 30% less relative copper content per MW in the solar field and 10% less in electronic equipment.|$|E
50|$|The {{removal of}} the decay heat is a {{significant}} reactor safety concern, especially shortly after normal shutdown or following a loss-of-coolant accident. Failure to remove decay heat may cause the reactor core temperature to rise to dangerous levels and has caused nuclear accidents, including the nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island and Fukushima I. The heat removal is usually achieved through several redundant and diverse systems, from which heat is removed via heat exchangers. Water is passed through the secondary side of the heat exchanger via the essential service water system which dissipates the heat into the 'ultimate heat sink', often a sea, river or large lake. In locations without a suitable body of water, the heat is dissipated into the air by recirculating the water via a cooling tower. The failure of ESWS <b>circulating</b> <b>pumps</b> {{was one of the}} factors that endangered safety during the 1999 Blayais Nuclear Power Plant flood.|$|E
50|$|High {{efficiency}} glandless <b>circulating</b> <b>pumps</b> {{have become}} the industry standard when developing and maintaining buildings within the European Union due to recent changes to the carbon emissions goals. Commercial and residential buildings now have to be outfitted with these pumps in order to decrease electricity usage and, in the long run, decrease the amount of pollutants produced. This new standard, {{referred to as the}} energy efficiency index (EEI), will set the bare minimum efficiency level at 0.27, and set the efficiency grading scale from this base value. The EU has also scheduled the efficiency scale to be revised again by August 1st, 2015 to set the minimum efficiency to 0.23. Various companies such as Wilo have successfully developed pumps that have been projected to save up to 80% in electricity usage, meeting both of the new grading scale minimums set this year and in 2015. Pump designs are still being revised to continually try to achieve higher efficiency standards and lower the impact on the environment {{in order to meet the}} goal of up to a 50% reduction in both CO2 emissions and electricity usage across the EU by 2020.|$|E
40|$|If {{the minimum}} {{anticipated}} fluid temperature in a ground source {{heat pump system}} falls near or below 0 oC, an antifreeze mixture must be used to prevent freezing in the heat pump. The antifreeze mixture type and concentration has a number of implications for the design and performance of the system. These include the required ground loop heat exchanger length, the capacity and energy consumption of the heat <b>pump,</b> the <b>circulating</b> <b>pump</b> selection, pumping energy, and the first cost of the system. For example, the required ground loop heat exchanger length and first cost will decrease, due to lower permissible operating temperatures, with increasing antifreeze concentration in heating-dominated climates. On the other hand, the antifreeze also degrades the heat pump performance; operating costs can be expected to increase with increasing antifreeze concentration, and a larger capacity heat pump may be needed. The complex interaction between all of the design variables makes it difficult to choose an optimal design, and it is desirable to have a simulation and life cycle cost analysis {{that can be used to}} evaluate all of the variable interactions, to be used as the basis for an optimal design procedure. This paper reports on a simulation procedure implemented in HVACSIM+ and a life cycle cost analysis and gives example result for a typical Canadian residential building. Four different antifreeze mixtures are considered; methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, propylene glycol and ethylene glycol. The life cycle cost analysis was based on the electricity costs for the heat <b>pump</b> and <b>circulating</b> <b>pump</b> and first costs for the heat <b>pump,</b> <b>circulating</b> <b>pump,</b> grout, borehole drilling, U-tube, and antifreeze...|$|R
