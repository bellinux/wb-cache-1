40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to define the {{acetabular}} changes associated with <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> and determine how these acetabuli differ from those of a normal hip. Charts and radiographs of 33 patients with <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> with a mean age of 6  years (range, 2 – 15  years) were retrospectively reviewed. The diagnosis was developmental <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> in 21 patients and congenital femoral deficiency in 12. Radiographic measurements, including acetabular index, sourcil slope, center edge angle, migration index, and medial joint space, were compared with those of 29 hips in the control group. The inclination of the acetabulum or acetabular slope (as measured by the acetabular index and sourcil slope) was significantly increased in the hips with <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> as compared with those in the control group. Both parameters have a statistically significant inverse correlation with the degree of varus, ie, the greater the varus of the proximal femur, the greater the upsloping of the acetabulum.

50|$|This {{condition}} was first described in 1986. {{and is a}} syndrome of camptodactyly, arthropathy, <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> and pericarditis. It may also include congenital cataracts. The cause of this syndrome was discovered in 1999.|$|R
30|$|Different {{techniques}} {{based on}} the same surgical principles but utilizing different implants for internal or external fixation of either intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric valgus osteotomies have been described for the surgical correction of <b>coxa</b> <b>vara.</b> The surgical technique most commonly used to achieve correction is the laterally based, intertrochanteric Y-shaped wedge osteotomy described by Pauwels [6], considered to be state of the art in the surgical management of infantile <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> [2]. Pauwels’s Y-shaped osteotomy is performed between the lesser and greater trochanters and perpendicular to the femoral shaft. It corrects the neck–shaft angle but the femoral shaft is positioned medially. However, it compromises the hip joint’s integrity, potentially endangering the nourishing vessels of the femoral head and thus increasing the risk of avascular necrosis [2]. Medial displacement in such patients should be strongly avoided as it exacerbates the loading of the distal femoral physis and the lateral compartment of the knee in patients with knee deformity (genu valgum), which is commonly also seen in cases of <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> [7].|$|R
50|$|<b>Coxa</b> <b>vara</b> is a {{deformity}} of the hip, {{whereby the}} angle between {{the head and}} the shaft of the femur is reduced to less than 120 degrees. This results in the leg being shortened, {{and the development of}} a limp. It is commonly caused by injury, such as a fracture. It can also occur when the bone tissue in the neck of the femur is softer than normal, causing it to bend under the weight of the body. This may either be congenital or the result of a bone disorder. The most common cause of <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> is either congenital or developmental. Other common causes include metabolic bone diseases (e.g. Paget's disease of bone), post-Perthes deformity, osteomyelitis, and post traumatic (due to improper healing of a fracture between the greater and lesser trochanter). Shepherd's Crook deformity is a severe form of <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> where the proximal femur is severely deformed with a reduction in the neck shaft angle beyond 90 degrees. It is most commonly a sequela of osteogenesis imperfecta, Pagets disease, osteomyelitis, tumour and tumour-like conditions (e.g. fibrous dysplasia).|$|R

50|$|It {{is correct}} for a {{knock-kneed}} deformity {{to be called}} both a varus deformity at the hip (<b>coxa</b> <b>vara)</b> and a valgus deformity at the knee (genu valgum); although the common terminology is to simply {{refer to it as}} a valgus knee.|$|R

Musculoskeletal presentation of this rare familial form of arthropathy is unique and heterogeneous. In all previous reports, non-inflammatory pattern of arthropathy involving the peripheral joints with typical <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> deformity were described, and in a few cases spine abnormalities, including kyphosis, lordosis, or scoliosis.

40|$|Congenital defects of the femur {{vary from}} simple {{hypoplasia}} {{of the bone}} to complete absence. Classification of these defects has been suggested by Nilsonne (1928) and by Mouchet and Ibos (1928), but neither has met with general acceptance. In more recent years Golding (1939, 1948) has demon-strated the close association of the short femur with congenital <b>coxa</b> <b>vara,</b> and has emphasized that these are variations of the same underlying abnor-mality. The clinical distinction between {{the various types of}} femoral defect is important as a guide to the prognosis of limb development. From an examination of patients with congenital abnormalities of the femur the following classifica-tion is suggested: 1. Simple femoral hypoplasia. 2. Congenital <b>coxa</b> <b>vara.</b> 3. Femoral hypoplasia with <b>coxa</b> <b>vara.</b> 4. Pseudarthrosis of the femur. 5. Hypoplasia of the lower femoral epiphysis. 6. Complete absence of the femur. Although these patients commonly have other skeletal defects, the major congenital abnormalities affecting the nervous system, or in the chest and abdomen, appear to be rare. Their span of life is thus rarely affected, and detailed autopsy or pathological examination of the limb is rarely possible. From the clinical examination of these patients, however, and from serial radiographs, much information can be obtained about the clinical course of the limb abnormality, {{and the nature of the}} underlying disturbance of growth...|$|R

5000|$|In {{acetabular}} dysplasia the acetabulum (socket) is too shallow or deformed. The center-edge {{angle is}} measured {{as described by}} Wiberg.

50|$|Bones {{also may}} be affected: {{symptoms}} may include enlarged bone marrow cavities, thinned cortical bone, or a distortion of the hip bone called <b>coxa</b> <b>vara.</b> Sleep-related disorders, such as sleep inversion, sleepiness {{during the day and}} wakefulness at night, may occur. Gelastic cataplexy, the sudden loss of muscle tone when the affected patient laughs, is also seen.|$|R
50|$|Children {{with this}} {{syndrome}} often present with a joint effusion that is cool and resistant to anti-inflammatory therapy. The arthropathy principally involves large joints such as elbows, hips, knees, and ankles.

25|$|The {{angle of}} {{inclination}} formed between the neck and shaft of the femur, (collodiaphysial angle), varies with age—about 150° in the newborn, it gradually decreases to 126-128° in adults, to reach 120° in old age. Pathological changes in this angle results in abnormal posture of the leg: A small angle produces <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> and a large angle in coxa valga; the latter is usually combined with genu varum and <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> leads genu valgum. Additionally, a line drawn through the femoral neck superimposed on a line drawn through the femoral condyles forms an angle, the torsion angle, which {{makes it possible for}} flexion movements of the hip joint to be transposed into rotary movements of the femoral head. Abnormally increased torsion angles results in a limb turned inward and a decreased angle in a limb turned outward; both cases resulting in a reduced range of a persons mobility.|$|R
40|$|Trochanteric {{fractures}} {{are one of}} the hip fractures, {{common in}} old age. However, they are not uncommon in younger age group.

Study Objective This study aimed to determine the causes of injury, treatment modalities used and short-term outcome of trochanteric fractures at Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institutes (MOI) from January 2012 - Decamber 2012 Methods A cohort study was done on adult patients with trochanteric fractures admitted and treated at Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute (MOI). Ninety one patients met the study inclusion criteria, four were lost follow-up, hence 87 patients were reviewed and completed the 16 weeks of follow ups. The structured questionnaire was used to interview the participants. These patients were treated either surgically or non surgical. Those who were surgically treated, immediate post-operative radiographs were taken, length of the lower limb and <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> deformity were assessed. Patients who were treated non surgically were put on skin traction for four weeks, then control radiographs were taken, lower limb length and <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> deformity were again assessed. There after each patient was followed up for a period of 16 weeks post treatment. In the follow-up visits, state of the wound, limb length discrepancy, <b>coxa</b> <b>vara</b> deformity and function of the hip joint were assessed. The obtained data were then analyzed by using SPSS version 16. 0 Results In this study 49 % of cases occurred after simple fall, 43. 7 % of cases occurred after Road Traffic Crash (RTC). Average age of occurrence was 62. 26 ± 19. 19 years with male to female ratio of 2 : 1.
