The key challenge {{here is to}} select channels providing a good tradeoff between connectivity and contention. In other words, channels with good opportunities for communication due to (1) low primary radio nodes (PRs) activities, and (2) limited contention of cognitive ratio nodes (CRs) acceding that channel, have to be selected. Thus, by dynamically exploring residual resources on channels and by monitoring the number of CRs on a particular <b>channel,</b> <b>SURF</b> allows building a connected network with limited contention where reliable communication can take place. Through simulations, we study the performance of SURF when compared with three other related approaches.

40|$|I don’t {{dress that}} bad! ” –Misti, {{targeted}} for a fashion makeover {{on the television}} show, What Not to Wear In the last two decades, definitions of literacy have stretched to accommodate fast-paced technological innovations and mushrooming media products. The notion of literacy as a fixed set of skills for reading and writing print has expanded to accommodate the multimodal literacies necessary to recognize, evaluate, and produce messages with a daunting variety of consumer goods and increasingly intuitive tools. Reading a multimodal text involves coordinating not just written and spoken language but also actions, images, and materials: turning {{the pages of a}} book, aiming a cursor and clicking a mouse, toggling a remote’s buttons to <b>channel</b> <b>surf,</b> or even navigating the maze of branded merchandise in a shopping mall.

Mediated discourse analysis (Scollon & Scollon, 2004) is an analytic approach relatively new to literacy research that provides a way of examining multimodal practices with the objects and artifacts valued by a community.

40|$|What is {{at stake}} when {{political}} revolt depends upon radical inner experience? Is the only route to cultural and political change, as Kristeva seems to argue, through personal introspection and revolt? If we want more from life than the freedom to <b>channel</b> <b>surf,</b> as she says, need the direction of inquiry be primarily inward? Need there be an either/or of psychical versus public life? Is the only answer to social and political dead ends really found by turning inward? Is the micropolitics of the couch the path to freedom? “Today,” Kristeva writes, “psychical life knows that it will only be saved if it gives itself the time and space of revolt: to break off, remember, re-form. From prayer to dialogue, through art and analysis, the crucial event is always the great infinitesimal emancipation: to be endlessly recommenced. ” In this essay I ask whether we might move Kristeva’s “New Forms of Revolt” from the couch to the polis {{with the help of}} one of her major interlocutors, Hannah Arendt, who reminds us that thinking is always a plural affair. I develop a link between Arendt’s thinking and Kristeva’s revolt to show how thinking-as-revolt puts subjects in relation {{to each other and to}} the political. Such a political culture of revolt can engage in the work needed to move beyond adolescent fixations in melancholic times. And with it we might in fact create more meaning for our lives.  </div...|$|E

She is characterized by [...] "exaggerated techno-consumerism": she constantly <b>channel</b> <b>surfs,</b> conducts business in the bathtub and on the toilet using a headset, orders in almost all her food, buys ten jars of asparagus just because she finds a parking spot in front of the grocery store, then gives them to a panhandler, fantasizes about running barefoot through chocolate truffles, orders them delivered, then says she does not recall ordering them because she has [...] "short-term memory loss due to excessive cellphone use". She shoots her expensive widescreen TV through the screen in a fit of pique and complains that [...] "the world is unfair" [...] because her TV is wrecked but Roger Willemsen is still alive. One of the two men with whom she associates, Dietrich, a bartender whose prime motive appears to be finding [...] "something fuckable", describes her as [...] "a consumer cripple with an amputated soul", which she admits to with pride. The other, Robert, is a concertmaster who can only get excited at the thought of long-dead film divas of yesteryear. Paprika's most characteristic sexual activity is masturbating to the late program on Arte; the first edition of the novel reputedly fell open at this scene. However, one day when she calls information, the operator gives her his own phone number. She enters an anonymous sado-masochistic sexual liaison with him recalling that in Laclos' Les Liaisons dangereuses: he calls himself Valmont. He summons her by SMS and abuses her, until suddenly he does not, and she falls apart from thwarted addiction, throwing her cellphone into the toilet, ripping the phone cord out of the wall, and drinking Laphroaig from the bottle. Instead of Valmont, an East German bumpkin, Maik, appears on her doorstep, so she shoots him and dumps his body in front of his own door for his wife, Mandy.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — IPTV {{delivers}} television content over an IP infrastructure {{with the}} potential to enrich the viewing experience of users by integrating data applications with video delivery. From an engineering perspective, IPTV places both significant steady state and transient demands on network bandwidth. Typical IPTV streaming techniques incur delays to fill the play-out buffer. But, when viewers switch or <b>surf</b> <b>channels,</b> it is important to minimize this user-perceived latency. Traditional Instant Channel Change (ICC) techniques reduce this latency by having a separate unicast assist channel for every user changing channels. Instead, we propose a multicast-based approach using a secondary "channel change stream " in association with the multicast of the regular quality stream for the channel requested. During channel change events, the user does a multicast join to this new stream and experiences smaller display latency. In the background, the play-out buffer of the new full-quality multicast stream is filled. Then, the transition to the new channel is complete. We show that this approach has several performance benefits including lower bandwidth consumption even during flash crowds of channel changes, lower display latency (50 % lower), and lower variability of network & server load. The tradeoff is a lower quality video during the play-out buffering period of a few seconds. Our results are based upon both synthetic channel change arrival patterns as well as traces collected from an operational IPTV environment...|$|R
