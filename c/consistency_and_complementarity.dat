In this study, we assess the reliability <b>and</b> <b>consistency</b> of these two techniques for measuring 3 -D ground displacements-and not only the displacement {{in the direction of the}} InSAR Line of Sight-on volcanoes during rapid changes. The use of a large amount of satellite data (X, C, L-band as well as right and left looking acquisitions) made it possible to retrieve the 3 -D displacement components with an unprecedented accuracy. We carry out this evaluation on the Piton de la Fournaise volcano, where four eruptions occurred in 2015. The comparison between GNSS and InSAR allows us: (i) to describe the deformation pattern associated with these eruptions, (ii) to quantify the discrepancies between InSAR and GNSS, and (iii) to discuss the limits <b>and</b> the <b>complementarities</b> of InSAR <b>and</b> GNSS. The ground deformation patterns associated with the four eruptions of Piton de la Fournaise in 2015 are typical of this volcano, with decimeter ground displacements asymmetrically distributed along the dike path, evidencing a preferential eastward motion, particularly visible thanks to the broad spatial coverage of InSAR Except for the NS component, InSAR and GNSS data are in overall agreement, with most of the GNSS-InSAR residuals < 2. 5 cm and < 5 cm on the EW and vertical component, respectively, i. e. within the error bar of the two methods. Most of the discrepancies on the terminal cone can be attributed to uncorrected atmospheric effects in InSAR.

40|$|The {{properties}} of unfolded proteins are essential {{both for the}} mechanisms of protein folding and for {{the function of the}} large group of intrinsically disordered proteins. However, the detailed structural and dynamical characterization of these highly dynamic and conformationally heterogeneous ensembles has remained challenging. Here we combine and compare three of the leading techniques for the investigation of unfolded proteins, NMR spectroscopy (NMR), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), with the goal of quantitatively testing their <b>consistency</b> <b>and</b> <b>complementarity</b> and for obtaining a comprehensive view of the unfolded-state ensemble. Using unfolded ubiquitin as a test case, we find that its average dimensions derived from FRET and from structural ensembles calculated using the program X-PLOR-NIH based on NMR and SAXS restraints agree remarkably well; even the shapes of the underlying intramolecular distance distributions are in good agreement, attesting to the reliability of the approaches. The NMR-based results provide a highly sensitive way of quantifying residual structure in the unfolded state. FRET-based nanosecond fluorescence correlation spectroscopy allows long-range distances and chain dynamics to be probed in a time range inaccessible by NMR. The combined techniques thus provide a way of optimally using the complementarity of the available methods for a quantitative structural and dynamical description of unfolded proteins both at the global and the local level...|$|E

Human natural killer cell receptor-P 1 A (NKRP 1 A) is one of the CTLRs and recognizes another CTLR, lectin-like transcript 1 (LLT 1) on target cells to control NK, NKT and Th 17 cells. The structural basis for the NKRP 1 A-LLT 1 interaction was limitedly understood. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ectodomain of LLT 1. The plausible receptor-binding face of the C-type lectin-like domain is flat, and forms an extended -sheet. The residues of this face are relatively conserved with another CTLR, keratinocyte-associated C-type lectin, which binds to the CTLR member, NKp 65.

40|$|The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) {{instrument}} provides global imagery at nine discrete viewing {{angles and}} four visible/nearinfrared spectral bands. MISR standard products include green {{leaf area index}} (LAI) of vegetation and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR). This paper describes the research basis for transitioning the MISR LAI/FPAR products from provisional to validation status. The efforts included not only comparisons to field data but also analyses of relationships, <b>consistency</b> <b>and</b> <b>complementarity</b> between various MISR products derived by independent algorithms. For example, we show how the energy absorbed by the ground below vegetation can be estimated from two independent MISR products, FPAR and BHRPAR (bi-hemispheric reflectance at PAR wavelengths). Further, we show that this information {{can be used to}} derive at least three measures of canopy structure — Beer's law extinction coefficient, mean leaf inclination and the gap fraction or vegetation ground cover. The spatial and temporal coverage of the LAI/FPAR product is mainly limited by cloud contamination. However, when a successful aerosol retrieval is performed, typically 95 % of pixels have surface reflectance retrievals suitable as input to the LAI/FPAR algorithm. The algorithm provides LAI/FPAR retrievals in 50 – 80 % of these pixels with suitable input. The early versions of the algorithm overestimated LAI values in grasses and broadleaf crops. The MISR LAI product from the recalibrated algorithm (version 3. 3) is assessed by comparison with field data collected in a 3 × 3 km agricultural area (grasses and cereal crops) near Avignon, France. LAI retrievals in other biomes are compared to MODIS LAI product of known accuracy. The MISR LAI product shows structural and phenological variability in agreement with data.

40|$|A {{number of}} new {{measurement}} methods for ice nucleating particles (INPs) have been introduced in recent years, {{and it is important}} to address how these methods compare. Laboratory comparisons of instruments sampling major INP types are common, but few comparisons have occurred for ambient aerosol measurements exploring the utility, <b>consistency</b> <b>and</b> <b>complementarity</b> of different methods to cover the large dynamic range of INP concentrations that exists in the atmosphere. In this study, we assess the comparability of four offline immersion freezing measurement methods (Colorado State University Ice Spectrometer, IS; North Carolina State University Cold Stage, CS; National Institute for Polar Research Cryogenic Refrigerator Applied to Freezing Test, CRAFT; University of British Columbia Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor – Droplet Freezing Technique, MOUDI-DFT) and an online method (continuous flow diffusion chamber, CFDC) used in a manner deemed to promote/maximize immersion freezing, for the detection of INP in ambient aerosols at different locations and in different sampling scenarios. We also investigated the comparability of different aerosol collection methods used with offline immersion freezing instruments. Excellent agreement between all methods could be obtained for several cases of co-sampling with perfect temporal overlap. Even for sampling periods that were not fully equivalent, the deviations between atmospheric INP number concentrations measured with different methods were mostly less than one order of magnitude. In some cases, however, the deviations were larger and not explicable without sampling and measurement artifacts. Overall, the immersion freezing methods seem to effectively capture INP that activate as single particles in the modestly supercooled temperature regime (>[*]− 20 [*]°C), although more comparisons are needed in this temperature regime that is difficult to capture with online methods. Relative to the CFDC method, three immersion freezing methods that disperse particles into a bulk liquid (IS, CS, CRAFT) exhibit a positive bias in measured INP number concentrations at below − 20 [*]°C, increasing with decreasing temperature. This bias was present, but much less pronounced for a method that condenses separate water droplets onto limited numbers of particles prior to cooling and freezing (MOUDI-DFT).

40|$|The modern {{welfare state}} and full-employment {{policies}} have common intellectual roots. In the 1930 s and 1940 s, Keynesian visions of full employment and Beveridge-inspired ideas {{of a universal}} welfare state grew up in about the same intellectual environment. Both ideas emphasized a government’s responsibility {{for the welfare of}} its citizens. The two ideas were also projected by approximately the same individuals. From the very beginning, welfare-state arrangements and full-employment policies were regarded as strongly complementary. Both were designed to improve the economic security of the individual, although welfare-state arrangements deal largely with life-cycle considerations, while full-employment policies focus on the situation at a given point in time. They were also believed to support each other. Not only would high aggregate employment help finance the welfare state by boosting the tax base and keeping down the number of beneficiaries. A reverse causation was also assumed: various welfare-state arrangements were often asserted to contribute to full employment. Hence a virtuous circle was postulated between the welfare state and full employment. Governments also constructed specific institutional arrangements and regulations that were explicitly designed to strengthen the <b>consistency</b> <b>and</b> <b>complementarity</b> between the welfare state and full-employment policies. Actual economic and social developments during the first decades after World War II seemed to support the view of a harmonious, indeed symbiotic,relation between the welfare state and full-employment policies. It turned out to be possible to combine full employment with high economic security and a gradually more even distribution of income, which are important ambitions of the welfare state. Exactly what, then, were the asserted complementarities between the welfare state and full-employment policies, and why do these complementarities look less convincing today? I would like to organize the discussion of these questions around four issues: (i) the influence of welfare-state arrangements on short-term macroeconomic stability; (ii) the long-term incentive effects of welfare-state arrangements, and related taxes, on aggregate employment and unemployment; (iii) the role of explicit administrative measures to boost aggregate employment in the long run; and (iv) the employment consequences of various labor-market regulations designed to fulfill much the same purposes as traditional welfare-state arrangements. The paper concludes with (v) a discussion, using a simple macro model, of how various welfare-state arrangements affect the contemporary employment crisis in Western Europe.
