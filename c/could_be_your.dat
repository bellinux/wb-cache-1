Sorry to have to be so blunt, but the country is in mortal danger from our present {{government}} and our liberty is already near dead because of this government. If you are too stupid to turn things around with your vote, there are people out here like me who are willing to turn things around with guns, force and violence. We hope our method does not become necessary.|$|E

5000|$|The Southern California duo named [...] "Faden Away" [...] {{as their}} {{favorite}} {{song on the}} album. [...] "I'm singing like a mothaf----r on there," [...] Snoop told HipHopDX. [...] "I just like the concept, too. When {{you get in a}} relationship with somebody, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> with <b>your</b> wife, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> with <b>your</b> girlfriend, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> with <b>your</b> kids, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> with <b>your</b> mom, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> with <b>your</b> brothers, 'cause <b>your</b> relationships <b>are</b> relationships. And it gets to a point in time where it begins to fade away. But you try your best to hold on and keep the good things there. And a lot of times, we always looked at the ones who make the relationship go bad, but when it go bad, we the ones who try to keep the relationship together. So it's like that song represents so much of who I am and what I'm going through. Not even on a personal tip, but on a business tip. Maybe I'm fading away on a business tip, or the music side. Maybe I'm fading away careerwise. But it just feels like, 20 years from now, that record is still gonna be the shit, no matter where we at." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{film was}} marketed with several taglines, including: [...] "We've always {{believed}} we weren't alone. On July 4, we'll wish we were", [...] "Earth. Take a good look. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> last", and [...] "Don't make plans for August". The weekend before the film's release, the Fox Network aired a half-hour special on the film, the first third {{of which was}} a spoof news report on the events that happen in the film. Roger Ebert attributed most of the film's early success to its teaser trailers and marketing campaigns, acknowledging them as [...] "truly brilliant".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} a positive review from Monica Herrera of Billboard, {{who called the}} song [...] "honest and adult". Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone cited [...] "Until It Beats No More" [...] as being one of two stand-outs songs on Love?; the other being [...] "On the Floor". Shane Phoenix of Hot Spots gave a positive review of the song, stating that the lyrics are [...] "spot on" [...] and the [...] "winds are fabo, the keys and key breaks in this one really allow her vocal sense {{to come out and}} shine".

5000|$|Their music Heaven (EP version) is {{the first}} song of 2007 Hollywood movie I <b>Could</b> Never <b>Be</b> <b>Your</b> Woman, with Michelle Pfeiffer.|$|R
500|$|The album's {{opening track}} is [...] "Survival". It is a [...] "sweetly funky number" [...] which tries to [...] "convey a loosely drawn {{narrative}} of the punishment she endured from the media and her feelings {{leading up to the}} release". It has a lyrical allusion to the singer's 1986 single [...] "Live to Tell", with double-tracked strong vocals and harmonies. In the song, Madonna enhanced the rhythmic sounds more and compressed the bass sounds, in order to cater to the then musical trend. Containing multiple hooks, [...] "Survival"'s lyrics are about dualities like heaven/hell, up/down, angels/saints. [...] "Secret", the second song, begins with just the sound of Madonna's voice singing over a rhythmic, folksy guitar in descending chord sequence, before opening up to a sparse, retro rhythm section. A deep percussion starts around the one minute mark, accompanied by wah-wah ascending string line, supporting the descending guitar. Towards the end, an upper harmonic melody is added to display variance. Madonna's voice remains {{at the center of the}} song's production, as she sings lyrics such as [...] "happiness lies in your own hand". Throughout the song, Madonna also sings the lyrics [...] "My baby's got a secret", however she never discloses what the secret may be. During the next song, [...] "I'd Rather Be Your Lover", Madonna lusts after the unattainable through processes of negotiation: [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> sister, I <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> mother, We could be friends, I'd even be your brother". Towards the middle of the song, an eight bar rap break is taken by singer and rapper Meshell Ndegeocello, who raps: [...] "Tell me what you want / Tell me what you need...". Madonna interrupts, with her voice foregrounded and juxtaposed over the short interjections of Ndegeocello's rap part. A trip hop track, the song is musically comparable to the tracks on Portishead's 1994 album, Dummy, and also contains influences of new jack swing. It uses a sample from [...] "It's Your Thing" [...] performed by Lou Donaldson.|$|E
500|$|Later reviews {{have also}} been positive: AllMusic's Mark Deming {{described}} Double Nickels on the Dime as a [...] "quantum leap into greatness" [...] for Minutemen, describing the album as [...] "full of striking moments that cohere into a truly remarkable whole" [...] and awarding a full five stars. Journalist Michael Azerrad, profiling Minutemen in his book Our Band <b>Could</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Your</b> Life (titled after a lyric from [...] "History Lesson – Part II"), named Double Nickels on the Dime as [...] "one of the greatest achievements of the indie era" [...] and {{described it as a}} [...] "Whitman's sampler of left-wing politics, moving autobiographical vignettes, and twisted Beefheartian twang". Several publications have raised their rating of the album in the years since its release; Rolling Stone re-reviewed Double Nickels on the Dime for the 2004 Album Guide and gave it its classic rating, a full five stars.|$|E

[...] " [...] and added, [...] "And with the three words, [...] "You're my person." [...] Cristina Yang and Meredith Grey {{solidified}} their status as the small screen's best best friends ever." [...] Marama Whyte of Hypable wrote, [...] "Critically, the key relationship in Meredith’s life was not her romance with Derek Shepherd, but her passionate, indestructible, absolutely enviable friendship with Cristina. Talk about relationship goals; who wants McDreamy when Cristina Yang <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> person. These two were the real powerhouse, and Shonda Rhimes didn’t shy away from making the audience remember this. Derek was the love of her life, but Cristina was her soul mate. More than anyone else, Cristina challenged Meredith, was honest with her, and inspired her. For these reasons, it was Cristina who was constantly the source of Meredith’s character development, not Derek." ...|$|E

Nas discusses his lifestyle in an environment where he [...] "loves committin' sins" [...] and [...] "life ain't shit, but stress, fake niggas and crab stunts", while describing himself as [...] "The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator/The type of nigga who be pissin' in your elevator". [...] "It Ain't Hard to Tell" [...] is a braggadocio rap: [...] "Vocals'll squeeze glocks, MC's eavesdrop/Though they need not to sneak/My poetry's deep, I never fail/Nas's raps should be locked in a cell" [...] It opens with guitars and synths of Michael Jackson's [...] "Human Nature" [...] (1983); the song's vocals are sampled for the intro and chorus sections, creating a swirling mix of horns and tweaked-out voices. Large Professor looped in drum samples from Stanley Clarke's [...] "Slow Dance" [...] (1978) and saxophone from Kool & the Gang's [...] "N.T." [...] (1971).|$|E

2500|$|Pettibon's artwork for the band's {{albums and}} flyers was equally stark and confrontational. He {{typically}} worked in one panel using only pen and ink, so the message conveyed {{had to be}} direct and powerful {{due to lack of}} space and color. According to Michael Azerrad in Our Band <b>Could</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Your</b> Life, the artwork [...] "was a perfect visual analogue to the music it promoted – gritty, stark, violent, smart, provocative, and utterly American." [...] It also provided a cerebral aspect to the band's image: as the mainstream media caricatured Black Flag as a mindlessly aggressive act, the pairing of their music with high-concept artwork hinted at a greater intelligence at work that was unknown to outsiders.|$|E

[...] He also bluntly told Mantle that the damage to his system was so severe that [...] "your next drink <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> last."
