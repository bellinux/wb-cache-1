5|$|Non-{{professional}} phagocytes {{are more}} limited than professional phagocytes {{in the type}} of particles they <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>up.</b> This is due to their lack of efficient phagocytic receptors, in particular opsonins—which are antibodies and complement attached to invaders by the immune system. Additionally, most nonprofessional phagocytes do not produce reactive oxygen-containing molecules in response to phagocytosis.|$|E

5|$|The eggs hatch after 53 to 60days of {{incubation}} by both parents.

Ravens are the main predatory threat to condor eggs, while golden eagles and bears are potential predators of condor offspring.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} area {{residents}} initiated {{an effort to}} have the former West Michigan Pike designated {{what is now called}} a Pure Michigan Byway. The designation would prioritize the area for historic preservation grants. A Preserve America grant funded a survey from June 2007 through September 2010, the results of which were a set of reports through the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office on the historical nature of the West Michigan Pike. In 2011, the group {{was in the process of}} securing resolutions from municipalities along the highway in support of the designation. According to officials working on the byway, it <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>up</b> to seven years to complete the process. The initial proposals had the byway continuing to Mackinaw City, but as approved in 2016, it runs from New Buffalo on I-94 to Ludington, following US31 except between business loops at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehall–Montague and Pentwater.|$|E
5|$|Albatross chicks take a {{long time}} to fledge. In the case of the great albatrosses, it <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>up</b> to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{assembling}} NAD de novo {{from simple}} amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing a pyridine base. The three vitamin precursors {{used in these}} salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). These compounds can be taken up from the diet and are termed vitamin B or niacin. However, these compounds are also produced within cells and by digestion of cellular NAD.

5|$|In January 2009 the Chancellor {{announced}} an Asset Purchase Facility (APF), {{to be administered}} by the MPC, aimed at ensuring greater liquidity in financial markets. The committee had already started to cut rates the previous autumn, but the effect of such changes <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>up</b> to two years and rates cannot go below zero. By March 2009, faced with very low levels on inflation and interest rates already at 0.5%, the MPC voted to start the process of quantitative easing (QE) – the injection of money directly into the economy – via the APF. It had the Bank buy government bonds (gilts), along with a smaller amount of high-quality debt issued by private companies. Although non-gilts initially made up a non-negligible part of the APF portfolio, as of May 2015 {{the entirety of the}} APF was held as gilts. On 7 August 2013, Governor Mark Carney issued the committee's first forward guidance as a third tool for controlling future inflation.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can only}} carry {{a limited number}} of weapons since the {{inventory}} features a 4-slot system in which single hand held pistols usually take a weapon slot whereas heavy weapons like sniper rifles or rocket launchers <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>up</b> to three weapon slots. The player's movement speed is also altered by the weight of the weapon the player is currently holding. Besides the primary function, all of the weapons in Perfect Dark Zero have one or two additional function modes that generally grant the player with special abilities. For example, the Shockwave Rifle features an X-ray function which allows the player to see enemies through walls, while the Plasma Rifle has a cloak function that renders the player character invisible to enemies at cost of its batteries. Some weapons also feature more unorthodox secondary functions. For instance, the Laptop Gun can be deployed as a sentry gun, while the SuperDragon assault rifle can launch bouncing grenades.|$|E

5|$|Some mammals {{have a large}} larynx {{and thus}} a {{low-pitched}} voice, namely the hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) where the larynx <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>up</b> {{the entirety of the}} thoracic cavity while pushing the lungs, heart, and trachea into the abdomen. Large vocal pads can also lower the pitch, as in the low-pitched roars of big cats. The production of infrasound is possible in some mammals such as the African elephant (Loxodonta spp.) and baleen whales. Small mammals with small larynxes have the ability to produced ultrasound, which can be detected by modifications to the middle ear and cochlea. Ultrasound is inaudible to birds and reptiles, which might have been important during the Mesozoic, when birds and reptiles were the dominant predators. This private channel is used by some rodents in, for example, mother-to-pup communication, and by bats when echolocating. Toothed whales also use echolocation, but, as opposed to the vocal membrane that extends upward from the vocal folds, they have a melon to manipulate sounds. Some mammals, namely the primates, have air sacs attached to the larynx, which may function to increase the volume of sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{next step}} is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>up</b> to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.|$|E
