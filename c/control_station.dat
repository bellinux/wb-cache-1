5|$|According to {{estimates}} {{made by the}} New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) in 2009, NY73 serves an average of 1,950 vehicles per day from US9 to {{the east end of}} the NY9N overlap in Keene. The overlap with NY9N accumulated an average of 4,360 vehicles, with the stretch up to the <b>control</b> <b>station</b> at NY913Q having a less amount of traffic. After NY913Q, the average increases, peaking at 4,810 vehicles at NY86 in Lake Placid.|$|E
5|$|Military bases {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} call the Army <b>Control</b> <b>Station</b> in Hiroshima. The complete silence from that city puzzled the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. It was felt that nothing serious had taken place and that the explosion was just a rumor.|$|E
5|$|The pole {{foremast}} {{was modified}} to a tripod after 1916. This {{was due to}} the increased weight of masthead fire-control equipment associated with director firing. In 1917 Lion and Princess Royal received searchlight towers on the aft funnel and mainmast while losing one four-inch gun each from the aft battery. In early 1918, both ships received flying-off platforms on 'Q' and 'X' turrets for Sopwith Pup and Sopwith 1½ Strutter aircraft, and Lion was fitted with a torpedo <b>control</b> <b>station</b> at the aft end of her aft superstructure.|$|E

5|$|Bond and Natalya meet Wade in the Florida Keys and borrow {{his plane}} {{for the trip}} to Cuba, where the same night, they make love. The next day, while searching for GoldenEye's {{satellite}} dish, they are shot down. Onatopp rappels down from a helicopter and attacks Bond. After a fight ensues, Bond shoots down the helicopter, which snares Onatopp and crushes her to death against a tree. Bond and Natalya watch water draining out of a lake, uncovering the satellite dish. They infiltrate the <b>control</b> <b>station,</b> and Bond is captured. Trevelyan reveals his plan to rob the Bank of England before erasing all of its financial records with the second GoldenEye (Misha), concealing the theft and destroying Britain's economy.|$|E
5|$|Enjebi, Aomon, and Runit Islands {{were cleared}} of {{vegetation}} and graded level {{to make it}} easier to install the required instrumentation, and a causeway was built between Aomon and Bijire so the instrument cables could be run from the test tower on Aomon to the <b>control</b> <b>station</b> on Bijire. The detonations were ordered so that later test areas would suffer minimal fallout from the earlier shots. The Army component, Task Group 7.2, was responsible for construction work. It consisted of the 1220th Provisional Engineer Battalion, with the 1217th and 1218th Composite Service Platoons, the 18th Engineer Construction Company and 1219th Signal Service Platoon; Companies D and E of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade's 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment; the 461st Transportation Amphibious Truck Company; 854th Transportation Port Company; 401st CIC Detachment; and the Naval Shore Base Detachment.|$|E
5|$|In June 1921, Provence and Bretagne went to Le Havre for a naval review, {{and were}} back in Toulon in September. In 1922, Provence and Lorraine were placed in reserve, leaving Bretagne {{the only member of}} her class in service; while out of service, Provence {{underwent}} a significant refit. The work lasted from 1 February 1922 to 4 July 1923, and was carried out in Toulon. The ship had her armament improved; her main guns were given greater elevation to increase their range, and four 75mm M1897 guns were installed on the forward superstructure. A heavy tripod mast with a fire <b>control</b> <b>station</b> and a rangefinder for the ship's anti-aircraft guns were also added.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{communications}} between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There {{is a brief}} delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for {{communications between}} ground control and Apollo 8 when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground <b>control</b> <b>station</b> had to wait at least threeseconds for the answer to arrive. The communications delay between Earth and Mars can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot {{on the surface of}} Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.|$|E
5|$|Fuel was pumped {{from the}} port storage tanks to the {{starboard}} side to correct the list and Lexington began recovering damaged aircraft and those that were low on fuel at 11:39. The Japanese had shot down three of Lexingtons Wildcats and five Dauntlesses, plus another Dauntless crashed on landing. At 12:43, the ship launched five Wildcats to replace the CAP and prepared to launch another nine Dauntlesses. A massive explosion at 12:47 was triggered by sparks that ignited gasoline vapors from the cracked port avgas tanks. The explosion killed 25 crewmen and knocked out the main damage <b>control</b> <b>station.</b> The damage did not interfere with flight deck operations, although the refueling system was shut down. The fueled Dauntlesses were launched and six Wildcats that were low on fuel landed aboard. Aircraft from the morning's air strike began landing at 13:22 and all surviving aircraft had landed by 14:14. The final tally was three Wildcats shot down, plus one Wildcat, three Dauntlesses and one Devastator that were forced to ditch.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye 007 closely {{follows the}} plot of the movie, though with some minor alterations. The game starts in Arkhangelsk in the Soviet Union in 1986, where MI6 has {{uncovered}} a secret chemical weapons facility at the Byelomorye Dam. James Bond and fellow 00-agent Alec Trevelyan are sent to infiltrate the facility and plant explosive charges. During the mission, Trevelyan is apparently killed by Colonel Arkady Ourumov, but Bond escapes by commandeering an aeroplane. Five years later in 1991, Bond is sent to investigate a satellite <b>control</b> <b>station</b> in Severnaya, Russia, where programmers Natalya Simonova and Boris Grishenko work. Two years after the Severnaya mission, in 1993, Bond investigates an unscheduled test firing of a missile in Kyrgyzstan, believed to be a cover for the launch of a satellite known as GoldenEye. This space-based weapon works by firing a concentrated electromagnetic pulse at any Earth target to disable any electrical circuit within range. As Bond leaves the silo, he is ambushed by Ourumov and a squad of Russian troops. Ourumov manages to escape during the encounter.|$|E

5|$|In {{the year}} 2001, {{the space station}} Silicon Valley was launched, housing {{numerous}} animals. Seven minutes after its launch, it vanished. Believed to have disappeared forever, it reappears in the year 3000, and the many expeditions sent to retrieve the space station vanished without explanation. Following this, the duo of Dan Danger and Evo were sent to investigate; they discover that the animal cargo has evolved and merged with the station's technology, resulting in animals such as an electronically-powered fox with motorised wheels, and a steam-powered hippopotamus. Evo sets out to fix the <b>control</b> <b>station,</b> which is {{on a collision course}} with Earth. Upon arriving at the control room, Evo confronts the Evil Brain, who is fascinated by Evo's abilities and wants to keep him to complete the collection of robotic animals. The Evil Brain threatens to destroy the Earth, but is quickly defeated by Evo. Despite this, Evo is unable to stop the space station from spinning out of control; it collides with Earth, landing in New York Harbor. The robotic animals escape and flee around New York City, and Evo sets out to terminate them before they terrorise the planet.|$|E
5|$|Now infected, Wesley uses {{a digital}} sample of Captain Picard's voice to lure key {{engineering}} crew-members {{away from the}} engineering deck. He erects a force field around the area with his tractor beam device and assumes control of the ship. He allows one of the engineers, Mr. Shimoda (Benjamin W.S. Lum), who is acting in a childlike manner, into the force field. Mr. Shimoda manages to remove all of the isolinear chips from the engine <b>control</b> <b>station</b> and plays with them like toys. As the supergiant star collapses, a fragment is blown into a direct impact course with the two Federation ships, and without the chips in place, they cannot move out of its way. Chief Engineer Sarah MacDougal (Brooke Bundy) manages to disable Wesley's force field, and Data is sent to replace the chips. He reports {{that he will not}} have enough time. Wesley reverses the ship's tractor beam, repelling the Enterprise off the Tsiolkovsky, giving themselves the necessary additional seconds for Data to replace the chips enabling the ship {{to move out of the}} way. The crew is cured of the ailment, and Picard partially credits Wesley for helping to prevent a disaster.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November 1941 MacLachlan was {{promoted}} to squadron leader, and was given command of No. 1 Squadron at Redhill Aerodrome, equipped with the Hawker Hurricane Mk. IIc for night intruder operations over western Europe. MacLachlan was assigned his personal aircraft, Hurricane BD983/JX-Q. He painted an emblem showing a left arm with a cannon shell passing through it and the fingers giving the V sign. The squadron spent the winter, 1941–2 in intensive night fighter training with searchlight and ground <b>control</b> <b>station.</b> In February 1942 he attended the Searchlight School at Shrivenham. In his absence he missed the Channel Dash and subsequent air battle during which the squadron lost two pilots. The squadron scored its first success on 1 April—his 23rd birthday—when Karel Kuttelwascher—with whom he often flew—destroyed two Ju 88s. MacLachlan found locating German aircraft in the dark difficult, though he himself claimed a locomotive damaged on the night and left two of its wagons destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The Ark, also {{referred}} to as Installation 00, is located outside the Milky Way galaxy and serves as the construction and <b>control</b> <b>station</b> for the Halo weapon system. It does not share the ringworld geometry of the other installations. During Halo 3, the Covenant discover a portal on Earth that leads to the Ark and are pursued by the humans and a breakaway faction of Covenant opposed to activating the rings. Gravemind, having hijacked High Charity, crash-lands on the installation. The remote firing of the rings is halted by Master Chief and the Arbiter. In order to end the threat of the Flood, Master Chief decides to activate Installation 04B under construction in The Ark, the replacement for the Halo that he destroyed in Halo: Combat Evolved. Unknown to everyone but 343 Guilty Spark, a premature firing would destroy the installation; the monitor attempted to defend 'his' ring but was destroyed by Master Chief, who proceeded to fire the weapon. The firing tears apart the incomplete Halo and severely damages The Ark as Master Chief, Cortana, and the Arbiter try to escape through the Portal, which closes as they enter, leaving Master Chief and Cortana drifting in space while the Arbiter returns to Earth successfully. The Ark appears in other Halo novels and the video game Halo Wars 2.|$|E
