Classifying compliance into five categories, fracture risk gradually increased with poorer compliance. These results emphasize the importance of treatment compliance in obtaining maximal treatment benefit. Introduction: Bisphosphonates are widely used to treat osteoporosis and reduce fracture risk. Low compliance is frequent and will limit treatment benefit. Methods: New female users of alendronate or risedronate between 1999 - 2004, aged ≥ 45 years were identified from PHARMO-RLS, including drug-dispensing and hospitalization data of ≥ 2 million residents of the Netherlands. Patients were followed until first hospitalisation for an osteoporotic fracture, death, or end of study period. Compliance with bisphosphonates during follow-up was measured over 90 -day intervals using Medication Possession Ratio (MPR). The association between compliance and fracture risk was analyzed using time-dependent Cox-regression. Results: The study cohort included 8, 822 new female bisphosphonate users, contributing in total 22, 484 person-years of follow-up. During follow-up, 176 osteoporotic fractures occurred (excluding the first six months). Non-compliant bisphosphonate use {{was associated with}} a 45 % increased fracture risk compared to <b>compliant</b> <b>use</b> (MPR ≥ 80 %). Classifying compliance into five categories, fracture risk gradually increased with poorer compliance (p-value < 0. 05 for trend). A MPR < 20 % {{was associated with a}}n 80 % increased fracture risk compared to a MPR ≥ 90 %. Conclusions: These results show a statistically significant association between level of compliance with bisphosphonates and level of fracture risk, emphasizing the importance of treatment compliance in obtaining maximal treatment benefit...|$|E

40|$|Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) {{has gained}} {{interest}} in many industrial applications {{due to its}} high strength-to-weight ratio, excellent heat tolerance and high corrosion resistance. Stress concentrators such as notches and geometrical discontinuities are present in many such components necessitating the reliable assessment of notch sensitivity of PEEK in monotonic tension. Here we evaluate {{the applicability of the}} strain energy density (SED) approach for the assessment of the fracture strength of experimentally tested notched geometries subject to corrosion. The fracture behavior of neat, circumferentially razor-grooved dog-bone specimens and circumferentially U-notched specimens with different notch radii can be predicted with a discrepancy lower than ± 10 %. Reliable predictions are shown on two previously published datasets employing both computed and published mechanical properties as inputs for the SED calculations. This report presents the first successful application of SED for PEEK as well as the successful prediction of tensile behavior in corrosive environments.

40|$|The risk {{of malaria}} poses {{travellers}} and their advisers with difficult problems as drug resistance spreads worldwide. Protection against infection rests on travellers' {{knowledge of the}} risk of malaria, on their avoidance of malaria vectors and on their <b>compliant</b> <b>use</b> of chemoprophylaxis. In this article, Robert Ste f fen and Ronald Behrens explain that one of the priorities for reducing malaria morbidity is to improve travellers' use of personal protection against mosquito bites. They show that none of the drugs, or combinations thereof, provide a 100 % efficacy, owing to increasing drug resistance, mainly of Plasmodium falciparum. The commonly used drugs for malaria prophylaxis (mefloquine, doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil) often cause minor side effects. All, except proguanil, have also been occasionally associated with severe adverse effects. Other drugs (pyrimethaminelsul fadoxine, amodioquine) are not suitable for chemoprophylaxis because of unacceptable adverse reactions. The use of drugs for self therapy is constrained by limitations of toxicity and efficacy, and the added difficulties of defining indications for safe and appropriate use...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Promoting and {{ensuring}} safe use of codeine containing medicines remains {{a public health}} issue given the rise in reporting of misuse and dependence particularly in countries where available over-the-counter (OTC). The aim of this unique {{study was to identify}} best practices in management of opioid abuse and dependence, particularly codeine, and innovations to meet challenges surrounding safe and <b>compliant</b> <b>use,</b> patient awareness-raising, reducing health harms and enhancing successful treatment of dependence. METHODS: A mixed methods approach using three data points was used that included : (1) analysis of data from existing scoping reviews to identify potential areas for innovation (2) interviews with key national stakeholders from public health, pharmaceutical, regulatory, primary care and addiction practice in three distinct regulatory regimes (Ireland, United Kingdom and South Africa); and (3) a circular email request for information on potential innovations to members of the European Medicine's Agency European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCEPP). Data from these three sources were analysed to identify best practices and opportunities for innovation. RESULTS: Best practices and potential innovations were identified under the nine headings: (1) manufacture; (2) product information and public education; (3) responsible prescribing; (4) monitoring and surveillance; (5) dispensing, screening and brief interventions in community pharmacies; (6) safety in the workplace and on the road; (7) internet supply of codeine and online support; (8) treatment of codeine dependence; and (9) learning resources and training for health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Challenges ensuring availability of codeine containing medicines for legitimate therapeutic use, while minimising misuse, dependence and related health harms warrant consideration of new innovations. Most promising innovative potential lies across the products' retail lifecycle from manufacture to prescriber and community pharmacy practitioner. This article is open to POST-PUBLICATION REVIEW.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research comprising this thesis was to characterize ovarian follicular development in healthy women of reproductive age undergoing natural menstrual cycles and oral contraception (DC) cycles. We quantified changes in the numbers and diameters of follicles, detected ovulation and assessed changes in the growth and regression of corpora lutea using high-resolution transvaginal ultrasonography. Changes in follicular and luteal development were then correlated with changes in concentrations of reproductively-active hormones and endometrial growth to provide a comprehensive approach to ovarian and uterine function. We documented, for the first time, that women exhibited waves of antral follicular development during the menstrual cycle. Two and three waves of follicle growth were observed. Major and minor waves of follicle development were characterized. Major waves were those in which a dominant follicle was selected for preferential growth; minor waves were those in which dominance was not manifest. Luteal progesterone production appeared to {{have a negative effect}} on the emergence and development of follicle waves in women. The ovarian follicular wave phenomenon has provided a new model for studying the growth and regression of ovarian follicles during the human menstrual cycle. Documentation of ovarian follicular waves in women has implications for the development of new strategies to manipulate ovarian follicular development, in particular hormonal contraceptive regimens and infertility therapies. We further documented that ovarian follicular development occurred during the <b>compliant</b> <b>use</b> of oral contraception. Follicles developed to ostensibly ovulatory diameters, and either regressed, ovulated or formed follicular cysts under the suppressive effects of DC. The majority of follicles that developed during DC use emerged during the hormone-free interval (HFI). We interpreted our findings to mean that ovarian follicular development during DC use was associated with loss of endocrine suppression during the HFI, rather than user non-compliance as previously speculated. The number and maximum diameter of follicles that developed during DC use were greater in women administered DC containing 20 µg versus 30 - 35 µg Ethinyl Estradiol formulations. Our results provided rationale for a reduction or complete elimination of the HFI in OC regimens, and the judicious use of low EE dose OC regimens (ie., 10 mm). Our findings demonstrated that dominant follicles secrete estradiol and become increasingly responsive to LH as they acquire functional dominance after becoming physiologically selected for preferential growth during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{photography}} can be invaluable in visually oriented medical practice. Providing {{a visual}} record, digital photographs aid diagnosis, monitor change and quantify response to therapy. Incorporating digital photography into general practice is growing easier. Widespread ownership of smartphones with inbuilt cameras has stimulated this practice. Smartphone cameras are simple and familiar to use, capture high resolution images that enhance the medical record, expedite advice and, ultimately, can improve patient care. The {{development and use}} of the smartphone is part of a broad wave of accelerated technological change. That change, the information revolution of the last 30 years, has enabled the collection and dissemination of that information on a scale previously unimaginable. It has also changed how Australians treat personal privacy. Personal information can be instantaneously shared, with or without consent, with friends and strangers. Expectations of privacy in younger generations may have dropped, but for many Australians, protection of privacy has become more urgent. In response, Australia has tried to unify its legal and regulatory approaches to privacy protection through recent amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). The Australian Privacy Principles were introduced to clarify and govern how personal information, such as healthcare information, can be collected, used and disclosed. The central role of the doctor in the collection and use of healthcare information required specific guidance for the profession. This was achieved through the professional Code of Conduct regulated by the Australian Medical Board. Despite these legislative and regulatory changes {{there appears to be a}} divergence between practitioners’ conduct and their legal and professional obligations when using clinical photography in their healthcare practice. Are doctors aware of the requirements of consent, use and disclosure, and storage security, as they apply to clinical photography? The relevant literature suggested they are not. To explore how technology has impacted privacy this paper examines how the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) affects digital photography used in the clinical management of skin conditions. The paper will describe how well-delineated boundaries of clinical information sharing are blurred in practice, if not in law. It seeks to address the reasons for the apparent knowledge deficit of privacy obligations amongst practitioners. Doctors looking to understand their privacy obligations will find it difficult; inconsistencies between laws and regulations making the regime challenging to traverse. This paper proposes possible solutions to raising awareness, promoting safer practices and can help mitigate privacy risks. <b>Compliant</b> <b>use</b> of digital photography is a value clinical tool which can facilitate patient care, while not endangering patient privacy...|$|E
