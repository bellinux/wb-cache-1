40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{controlled}} study is to determine satisfaction with speech and facial appearance in Flemish pre-pubescent children with unilateral cleft lip and palate. Forty-three subjects with unilateral cleft lip and palate and 43 age and gender matched controls participated in this study. The Cleft Evaluation Profile {{was used to assess}} the perceived satisfaction for individual features related to cleft care. Both the cleft palate subjects and their parents were satisfied with the speech and facial appearance. The Pearson x 2 test revealed significant difference between the cleft palate and the control group regarding hearing, nasal aesthetics and function, and the appearance of the lip. An in depth analysis of well specified speech characteristics revealed that children with clefts and their parents significantly more often reported the presence of an articulation, voice and resonance disorder and experienced /s/ /r/ /t/ and /d/ as the most difficult consonants. To what extent the incorporation of specific motor oriented oral speech techniques regarding the realisation of specific consonants, attention to vocal and ear care, and the recommendation of secondary velopharyngeal surgery, with the incorporation of primary correction of the cleft nose deformity simultaneously with primary lip <b>closure,</b> will <b>aid</b> these patients are future research subjects...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The heterotrimeric SecY/Sec 61 {{complex is}} a protein-conducting channel that {{provides}} a passage for proteins across the membrane {{as well as a}} means to integrate nascent proteins into the membrane. While the first function is common among membrane protein channels and transporters, the latter is unique. Insertion of nascent membrane proteins, one transmembrane segment at a time, by SecY likely occurs through a lateral gate in the channel. Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to investigate the mechanism of gate opening. Opening and closing the gate under different conditions allowed us to identify structural elements that resist opening as well as those that <b>aid</b> <b>closure.</b> SecE, considered to act as a clamp keeping the lateral gate closed, was found to play no such role. Loosening of the plug by lateral gate opening, a potential step in channel gating, was also observed. The simulations revealed that lipids on time scales of up to 1 ís do not flood channels with an open lateral gate. Protein trafficking by the Sec pathway is a cellular process common to all domains of life. Newly formed (or forming), unfolded proteins are targeted by means of an N-terminal signal sequence to the Sec translocon in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (in eukaryotes) or the cytoplasmi...|$|R
40|$|Waste from {{construction}} and demolition activities {{represents one of}} the highest volumes of waste in Europe. 500 million tonnes are produced throughout the whole EU every year. In some EU members like Spain, approximately 83 per cent of such waste is disposed in landfills. The remaining part is classified and processed in treatment facilities so that it can later be used as recycled aggregates in the construction sector (sand, gravel, aggregates, etc.) but without much commercial success. The aim {{of this study is to}} use recycled aggregates from inert wastes (IW) in the different phases of a landfill (construction, operation and <b>closure)</b> with the <b>aid</b> of a new computer tool called LABWASTE. 14. This tool incorporates the mathematical relationship among the activities of the landfill and provides as a result the economic viability of using recycled aggregates compared to aggregates from quarries. Therefore, knowing the needs of aggregates in landfills (dams, drainage layers, covering layers, collection wells, etc.) may determine the amount of IW that could be recovered. These calculations can be obtained from some of the data that is introduced (population, land physiography, etc.). Furthermore, the use of LABWASTE. 14 makes it possible to reduce the demand for aggregates from quarries...|$|R

30|$|Retrograde {{access to}} the IIA is rarely required, {{with only a few}} cases {{reported}} in the literature (Aberhalden et al. 2012), (Kabutey et al. 2014). Werner-Gibbings et al. 2013 used a superior gluteal approach to treat a type 2 endoleak following EVAR. Previous approaches have used puncture of the gluteal branches to obtain {{access to the}} IIA. Kabutey et al. 2014 have used the gluteal artery approach to coil bilateral IIA aneurysms. In that case, haemostasis was achieved with manual compression. To our knowledge, this is the first published case to use an Angio-Seal (Terumo) to close the arteriotomy following retrograde embolization of the IIA. The intention in this case was to puncture a posterior division branch of the IIA to allow manual compression {{at the end of the}} procedure, however visualisation with ultrasound was extremely limited and this resulted in puncture of the anterior division. The decision was made to proceed with embolisation and use a <b>closure</b> device to <b>aid</b> in haemostasis due to the lack of a bony structure for compression. The technique described herein, using a 4 French dilator within the sheath to visualise the artery is safe and effective in any scenario where there is no backflow of blood from the vessel. This is an off-label use of the Angio-Seal (Terumo) device.|$|R

The patient was hospitalized for vacuum-assisted <b>closure</b> therapy to <b>aid</b> in wound healing. After the first treatment session, the patient reported abdominal pain with haematemesis and fever (40 °C). Owing to persistent fever, three blood cultures were performed, all positive for Kocuria kristinae. The identification was based on biochemical tests and automated systems. The speciation of the micro-organism was achieved with MALDI-TOF and then confirmed by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Transthoracic echocardiographic examination showed the presence of a large vegetation (38 × 20 mm) on the posterior mitral leaflet and moderate mitral regurgitation. Since there are no current guidelines for the treatment of K. kristinae endocarditis, empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin (1. 5 g twice daily) and gentamicin (6 mg kg(- 1) per day) was started. After 7 days of hospitalization, the patient's condition suddenly worsened because of the occurrence of haemorrhagic stroke. Despite inotropic support and rifampicin infusion, the haemodynamic status progressively deteriorated. After an initial improvement, he worsened again, becoming stuporous, hypotensive and dyspnoeic. In the following days, the patient developed compartment syndrome resulting in right foot ischaemia. Unfortunately, 25 days after hospitalization, the patient died of multiple organ failure from overwhelming sepsis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of K. kristinae endocarditis on a native valve that is not related to a central venous catheter but associated with diabetic foot infection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{principle}} of stretching wound margins for primary wound closure is commonly practiced {{and used for}} various skin defects, leading at times to excessive ten-sion and complications during wound closure. Different surgical techniques, skin stretching devices and tissue expanders have been utilized to address this issue. Previ-ously designed skin stretching devices resulted in consider-able morbidity. They were invasive by nature and associated with relatively high localized tissue pressure, frequently leading to necrosis, damage and tearing of skin at the wound margins. To assess the clinical effectiveness and perfor-mance and, to determine the safety of TopClosure ® for gradual, controlled, temporary, noninvasive and invasive applications for skin stretching and secure wound closing, the TopClosure ® device was applied to 20 patients for preoperative skin lesion removal and to secure closure {{of a variety of}} wound sizes. TopClosure ® was reinforced with adhesives, staples and/or surgical sutures, depending on the circumstances of the wound and the surgeon’s judgment. TopClosure ® was used prior to, during and/or after surgery to reduce tension across wound edges. No significant com-plications or adverse events were associated with its use. TopClosure ® was effectively used for preoperative skin expansion in preparation for dermal resection (e. g., con-genital nevi). It <b>aided</b> <b>closure</b> of large wounds involving significant loss of skin and soft tissue by mobilizing skin and subcutaneous tissue, thus avoiding the need for skin grafts or flaps.

40|$|In July 2013, a {{miniature}} horse {{presented to the}} Cornell University Equine and Farm Animal Hospital Orthopedic Surgery Service with the complaint of acute, non-weight bearing lameness of the right hind limb. A coxofemoral luxation was diagnosed {{using a combination of}} physical exam, radiographic and computer tomography findings. The luxation was surgically reduced and secured with an extra-capsular suture technique using screws and fiber wire. Within 48 hours, the repair had failed and re-luxation occurred. The horse was again brought for surgical repair of the luxation using a similar technique using additional wire and screws. 72 hours later the horse luxated a third time, and a femoral head and neck ostectomy was elected. Following the third surgery an infection developed with multiple drug resistant bacteria cultured from the site. Stent bandages that had previously been covering the incision site were replaced with a sterile vacuum-assisted wound <b>closure</b> system to <b>aid</b> in removal of purulent drainage from the site, and antibiotics were chosen based on susceptibility results from the culture. Breakdown of the left hind limb suspensory mechanisms began to occur with the prolonged reduced weight bearing of the right hind limb. This was addressed through various techniques, including pain management, shoeing, and physical therapy to encourage use of the right hind limb. Over the next few weeks management for pain, infection, and breakdown of the opposite leg was performed with positive initial results. However, about one month after the initial presentation to the Cornell Equine and Farm Animal Hospital, the horse suffered an episode of a sudden increase in pain and discomfort, reverting to almost complete non-weight bearing lameness. Radiographs and CT evaluation were performed to rule out causes of the sudden increase in pain, with the only notable finding being contact between the femur and acetabulum. A femoral and sciatic nerve block were performed using EMG to attempt to isolate pain and rule out neuropathic causes, and an epidural catheter was placed for regular infusion of pain medication. Eventually the horse became refractory to all increases in pain management and therapy that was attempted, and the owner elected euthanasia and necropsy...|$|R
40|$|A {{basic problem}} in insect {{metamorphosis}} is {{the means by}} which insects change shape. This can be studied by examining the shape changes of individual epidermal cells. I have found that removal of the basal lamina from the epidermis allows the shape and basal surfaces of these cells to be seen by scanning electron microscopy. In the 5 th larval stage of Calpodes ethlius the cells extend basal processes or feet. Feet develop in three phases. Just after ecdysis they are short and randomly oriented. The cells are closely packed and their bases have punctate hemidesmosomes. The hemidesmosomes become elongated and axially oriented before commitment to pupation. The feet then also extend, and orient axially. The feet contract late in the stadium, disappearing as the cells move to their pupal positions. This cell rearrangement is facilitated by the formation of wide intercellular lymph spaces. Filopodia span and presumably <b>aid</b> <b>closure</b> of the spaces between the cells at pupation. The changes in the feet suggest that they are prime movers in epidermal morphogenesis.;The disposition of the cytoskeleton is related to the control of cell shape. For example, orientation of the feet may be controlled by selective stabilization of dynamically unstable microtubules. My work on epidermal cells suggests that cytoskeletal shape may also be influenced by somatic inheritance. The cells contain apical bundles of F-actin (shown using rhodaminyl phalloin labeling) which survive for about 36 hours after the 4 th- 5 th larval ecdysis and associate with a transverse cuticle component. The number of bundles is paired in adjacent cells which are presumed to be siblings. The maintenance of cytoplasmic continuity through midbodies connecting siblings may preserve the paired patterns. These patterns are a result of sibling similarity, either in ploidy or by the inheritance of transient determinants for bundle pattern and position.;I have found that the secretory cell of the dermal gland is another epidermal cell whose shape is partly determined by the arrangement of its microfilament skeleton. The cell is distended during the intermoult by accumulation of secretion in vacuoles encapsulated by F-actin. At ecdysis the microfilament capsules collapse while the secretion is discharged and the cell shrivels. The microfilaments form into storage bundles which are then redistributed into capsules. This cycle repeats in each stadium until the cell atrophies in the pupa...|$|R
40|$|With rapid {{progress}} made in employing computational techniques for various complex Navier-Stokes fluid flow problems, design optimization problems traditionally based on empirical formulations and experiments {{are now being}} addressed {{with the aid of}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD). To be able to carry out an effective CFD-based optimization study, it is essential that the uncertainty and appropriate confidence limits of the CFD solutions be quantified over the chosen design space. The present dissertation investigates the issues related to code verification, surrogate model-based optimization and sensitivity evaluation. For Navier-Stokes (NS) CFD code verification a least square extrapolation (LSE) method is assessed. This method projects numerically computed NS solutions from multiple, coarser base grids onto a freer grid and improves solution accuracy by minimizing the residual of the discretized NS equations over the projected grid. In this dissertation, the finite volume (FV) formulation is focused on. The interplay between the xi concepts and the outcome of LSE, and the effects of solution gradients and singularities, nonlinear physics, and coupling of flow variables on the effectiveness of LSE are investigated. A CFD-based design optimization of a single element liquid rocket injector is conducted with surrogate models developed using response surface methodology (RSM) based on CFD solutions. The computational model consists of the NS equations, finite rate chemistry, and the k- 6 turbulence <b>closure.</b> With the <b>aid</b> of these surrogate models, sensitivity and trade-off analyses are carried out for the injector design whose geometry (hydrogen flow angle, hydrogen and oxygen flow areas and oxygen post tip thickness) is optimized to attain desirable goals in performance (combustion length) and life/survivability (the maximum temperatures on the oxidizer post tip and injector face and a combustion chamber wall temperature). A preliminary multi-objective optimization study is carried out using a geometric mean approach. Following this, sensitivity analyses with the aid of variance-based non-parametric approach and partial correlation coefficients are conducted using data available from surrogate models of the objectives and the multi-objective optima to identify the contribution of the design variables to the objective variability and to analyze the variability of the design variables and the objectives. In summary the present dissertation offers insight into an improved coarse to fine grid extrapolation technique for Navier-Stokes computations and also suggests tools for a designer to conduct design optimization study and related sensitivity analyses for a given design problem...|$|R
