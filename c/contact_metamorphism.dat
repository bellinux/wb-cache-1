40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the geology of the Nautanen area. It {{is part of the}} SGU-financed project, Metamorphic Map of Sweden, which aims to compile {{metamorphic}} data from Sweden and {{takes the form of a}} number of Bachelor and Master projects. The main metamorphic event in the Nautanen area is the Svecokarelian Orogeny (1. 96 – 1. 75 Ga). The samples are metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks, which were intruded by intermediate to mafic intrusions and a later granite intrusion. The supracrustal rocks are folded and the Nautanen Deformation Zone (NDZ) traverses the area in a NW to SE direction. Petrographic studies, XRF analysis and THERMOCALC were used to estimate pressure and temperature and to elucidate evidence of fluid mobility. The average pressure was assumed to be below 4 kbar because of the presence of andalusite. The lowest and highest temperatures for metamorphism were 474 ± 43 °C and 681 ± 14 °C, with highest temperatures recorded nearest to the granite intrusion. XRF analysis revealed high concentrations of Ba (up to 7000 ppm) in the NDZ. High concentrations of Ba, skarn formation and replacement of garnet by chlorite indicate fluid-controlled metamorphism in the NDZ. The increasing temperature towards the granite intrusion suggests regional or <b>contact</b> prograde <b>metamorphism</b> that need not be related to the NDZ.

40|$|The Holyrood granite {{batholith}} is a dome-shaped igneous body, approximately 40 {{miles in}} length and 8 miles in width forming {{the backbone of the}} Avalon Peninsula. Its western part intrudes folded volcanic rocks of pre-Cambrian age, the Harbour Main Group. Its eastern boundary is defined by a fault. Petrographic studies of the north-western part of the batholith have indicated that it is biotite granite which can be divided into two main types: [...] 1. A coarse-grained variety containing numerous inclusions, low in biotite and relatively little altered. [...] 2. A medium-grained type with only few xenoliths, a higher biotite content and greater degree of alteration. [...] Intrusive contacts between the granite and tuffs of the Harbour Main Group can be seen clearly in the field, but no intrusive relationships with the sediments of the Conception Group were observed in the area studied. However, basal conglomerates of the Conception Group contain cobbles of pink Holyrood granite indicating a pre-Conception age for the granite. No definite lineation or foliation appear in the outcrops, indicating that the granitic pluton is post-kinematic. Its contacts with the country rocks are very sharp without any pronounced mineralogical changes. Studies of rocks within the contact zone adjacent to the granite indicate that there is little evidence of <b>contact</b> (thermal) <b>metamorphism</b> accompanying the intrusion. The most striking effect of the granite on the older rocks has been the introduction of silica, water and/or carbon dioxide and to a minor extent the addition of lime. [...] Parts of the country rocks were incorporated in the granitic magma during emplacement; by assimilation various granodioritic and dioritic hybrid rocks have been formed. The granite was subjected to considerable stress during and after crystallization. Several pegmatite bodies associated with the granite, some containing giant quartz crystals, are poor in minerals containing volatile elements. This indicates that either the granitic residum lacked such hyperfusible constituents, or they may have escaped from a shallow intrusion through a porous or fractured roof...|$|R

2500|$|The Yule Marble is a {{metamorphic}} facies of the regionally distributed Leadville Limestone of Mississippian age deposited 350 million to 324 million years ago. The Leadville within the Yule area was transformed by <b>contact</b> <b>metamorphism</b> {{that occurred during}} the latest Eocene and Oligocene epochs (34 million to 28 million years ago) associated with the intrusion and uplift of the nearby granitic Treasure Mountain Dome. The uplift of the Treasure Mountain Dome tilted the limestone away from the intrusion resulting in the marble bed dipping at an angle into the mountain. [...] The marble unit along with older and younger adjacent units in the Yule Valley have a north-northwest strike paralleling the valley and variable dips of 35 to 50 degrees to the west-southwest. [...] This local contact with the heat and pressure from the intrusion of hot granitic magma recrystallized the Leadville Limestone into a distinctive white marble.

40|$|Intercalated Archean komatiites and dacites sit above a thick {{footwall}} dacite unit in {{the host}} rock succession at the Black Swan Nickel Mine, north of Kalgoorlie in the Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia. Both lithofacies occur in units that vary in scale from laterally extensive at {{the scale of the}} mine lease to localized, thin, irregular bodies, from > 100 m thick to only centimetres thick. Some dacites are only slightly altered and deformed, and are interpreted to post-date major deformation and alteration (late porphyries). However, the majority of the dacites display evidence of deformation, especially at <b>contacts,</b> and <b>metamorphism,</b> varying from silicification and chlorite alteration at contacts to pervasive low grade regional metamorphic alteration represented by common assemblages of chlorite, sericite and albite. Texturally, the dacites vary from entirely massive and coherent to partially brecciated to totally brecciated. Strangely, some dacites are coherent at the margins and brecciated internally. Breccia textures vary from cryptically defined, to blocky, closely packed, in situ jig-saw fit textures with secondary minerals in fractures between clasts, to more apparent matrix rich textures with round clast forms, giving apparent conglomerate textures. Some clast zones have multi-coloured clasts, giving the impression of varied provenance. Strangely however, all these textural variants have gradational relationships with each other, and no bedding or depositional structures are present. This indicates that all textures have an in situ origin. The komatiites are generally altered and pervasively carbonate veined. Preservation of original textures is patchy and local, but includes coarse adcumulate, mesocumulate, orthocumulate, crescumulate-harrisite and occasionally spinifex textures. Where original contacts between komatiites and dacites are preserved intact (i. e. not sheared or overprinted by alteration), the komatiites have chilled margins, whereas the dacites do not. The margins of the dacites are commonly silicified, and inclusions of dacite occur in komatiite, even at the top contacts of komatiite units, but komatiite clasts do not occur in the dacites. The komatiites therefore were emplaced as sills into the dacites, and the intercalated relationships are interpreted as intrusive. The brecciation and alteration in the dacites are interpreted as being largely due to hydraulic fracturing and alteration induced by contact metamorphic effects and hydrothermal alteration deriving from the intrusion of komatiites into the felsic pile. The absence of autobreccia and hyaloclastite textures in the dacites suggest that they were emplaced as an earlier intrusive (sill?) complex at a high level in the crust...|$|R

40|$|Small basaltic dikes of the Killala dike swarm have {{irregular}} contact aureoles. Contact aureoles of dikes 1. 5 to 2 m thick are discontinuous {{and include}} only the grossularite zone. The grossularite zone adjacent to dikes greater than 4 m thick is continuous, but may change thickness {{along the length}} of the dike at dike-contact offsets and may differ in thickness on opposite sides of the dike. The wollastonite zone is present only locally along the contacts of dikes 4 to 5 m thick. Typical methods of modeling contact aureoles including: thermal modeling, analysis of bulk composition, analysis of differential fluid flow, and non-dilational emplacement processes only partly explain the observed irregularities in the metamorphic zones along and across the dikes. ^ The absence of a grossularite zone in the aureoles of dikes less than 1 m thick, its discontinuous development in the aureoles of dikes 1 to 2 m thick, and the location of the grossularite-in and smectite-out isograds closer to the dikes than predicted by thermal history modeling, argue for kinetic inhibition of the grossularite-producing reaction during the short time during which the aureole was heated above 350 ∘C. ^ The absence of a wollastonite zone in the aureoles of dikes less than 5 m thick, and its discontinuous development in the aureole of a 5 m thick dike, may be explained by reaction overstepping. If reaction overstepping is high, the path of fluid-rock system on T-XCO 2 diagram intersects the wollastonite-producing reaction. If overstepping is low, the path of fluid-rock system never intersects the wollastonite-producing reaction. The amount of overstepping is influenced by the amount of fluid flow. Presence of pore-lining cements in preserved fossils in the inner grossularite- and wollastonite zones implies a pathway for enhanced fluid flow was present in the inner <b>contact</b> aureole during <b>metamorphism.</b> ^ Reaction overstepping in combination with non-dilational process during dike emplacement may explain the development of irregular contact aureoles.

The calculated properties are consistent with greater stabilities of the β isomers (2 -MP and 3 -MP) relative to the α isomers (1 -MP and 9 -MP) at 25 °C. However, the metastable equilibrium values of the abundance ratios 2 -MP/ 1 -MP (MPR) and (2 -MP + 3 -MP) /(1 -MP + 9 -MP) (MPI- 3) decrease with temperature, becoming < 1 at ~ 375 – 455 °C. The thermodynamic model is consistent with observations of reversals of these organic maturity parameters at high temperature in hydrothermal and metamorphic settings. Application of the model to data reported for the Paleoproterozoic Here’s Your Chance (HYC) Pb–Zn–Ag ore deposit (McArthur River, Northern Territory, Australia) indicates a likely effect of high-temperature equilibration on reported values of MPR and MPI- 3, but this finding is contingent on the location within the deposit.

40|$|The western Lake St. Joseph area in Northwestern Ontario is {{underlain}} by Archean metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks. The strata, {{referred to}} as the Lake St. Joseph Group comprise three formations representative of mafic to felsic volcanic cyclicity. The Blackstone Formation, stratigraphically the lowest, contains a lower member composed of predominantly high-Mg, low-K tholeiitic pillowed basalts and an upper member composed of rhyoliticflows and pyroclastic rocks. The overlying Western Lake St. Joseph Formation contains a lower member composed of predominantly calc-alkaline massive and pillowed basalts and an upper member composed of dacitic pyroclastic and epiclastic rocks. The overlying Carling Formation contains a volcanic member and a sedimentary member. The volcanic member is composed predominantly of high-Fe, low-K tholeiitic pillow breccias and dacitic to rhyolitic epiclastic and pyroclastic rocks. The sedimentary member consists of basal greywacke turbidites and laminated iron formation of economic potential overlain by chloritic classical turbidites. These sedimentary rocks are overlain by massive and cross-bedded arkosic greywackes which are in turn overlain by conglomerate and pebbly sandstone. The deformation of the rocks is expressed by isoclinal folding, most evident on Eagle Island, and development of the regional Lake St. Joseph Fault. <b>Contact</b> and regional <b>metamorphism</b> (lower to middle greenschist facies) have also affected the rocks. The primary structures, vertical and lateral variations in the felsic volcanic rocks of the Blackstone and Western Lake St. Joseph Formations indicate deposition on a subaqueous paleoslope. Similarly the felsic volcanic rocks of the Carling Formation indicate subaqueous deposition on a different paleoslope. The lithologies, primary structures, vertical and lateral variations of the units in the sedimentary member of the Carling Formation indicate deposition on a prograding submarine fan. Meyn and Palonen (1980) support this interpretation. Reconstruction of the paleoenvironment envisages three stages of evolution. In stage 1 the Blackstone and Western Lake St. Joseph Formations are extruded and deposited on the flank of a volcanic edifice. In stage 2 the volcanic member of the Carling Formation is extruded from a separate vent and in part deposited upon the degradation products of stage 1. In stage 3 laminated iron formation is deposited with clastic sediments in a submarine fan-basin plain system to form the sedimentary member of the Carling Formation...|$|R
40|$|We {{have made}} a {{petrographic}} study of the iron meteorites: Derrick Peak (IIB), Cape York (IIIA), Grant (IIIB), Gibeon (IVA) and Santa Clara (IVB). Each of these meteorites {{has been reported to}} contain excess ^(107) Ag from the decay of now extinct ^(107) Pd. Isotopic data on metal and sulfide phases for groups IIB and IIIAB iron meteorites have been explained using conventional interpretations which show a correlation between ^(107) Ag/^(109) Ag and Pd/Ag while data on sulfide nodules in meteorites from groups IVA and IVB are very complex. We have studied the extent to which shock and thermal events may have caused the redistribution of Ag and disturbed the original relationship between ^(107) Ag∗ and Pd, particularly in sulfide-rich regions. The petrography of the iron meteorites studied is consistent with the Pd-Ag isotopic data. The textures observed in the metal and sulfide in groups IIA and IIIAB were found to be indicative of shock but not extensive thermal <b>metamorphism.</b> The <b>contacts</b> between metal and sulfide are sharp and the sulfide and metal have remained discrete homogeneous phases. These meteorites yield isochrons between metal and sulfide and it is concluded that no significant Ag redistribution occurred after their formation. The petrography of group IVA and IVB meteorites reveals a history involving extensive shock and thermal <b>metamorphism.</b> <b>Contacts</b> between metal and sulfide nodules are irregular and the two phases are intimately mixed. In Gibeon, unequilibrated α_ 2 -martensitic structures in the metal matrix suggest that some reheating affected entire individual fragments of this meteorite. While bulk samples of the metal phases of the IVA and IVB meteorites appear well behaved with regard to Pd-Ag systematics, the sulfide-rich regions show extreme isotopic heterogeneities and do not yield well-defined isochrons. The Pd-Ag data reflect complicated postformation Ag transport. This petrographic study has found that the complexity of Pd-Ag isotopic data is related to the shock and thermal histories of the iron meteorites. However, no self-consistent explanation has been found to explain the Pd-Ag results observed for the nodules.

The Utah-Idaho state line is three miles south of the studied area and the Cassia-Oneida county line bounds it on the east. The area is nearly square and encompasses about 30 square miles. Devonian, Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, Permian, Tertiary and Quaternary sedimentary rocks are exposed within the area. Limestone, dolomitic limestime, quartzite, and beeded chert represent the Jefferson Formation of Devonian age. It is 400 feet thick, however, the base is not exposed. The Milligen Formation is Early Mississippian in age and is black argillite with interbedded orthoquartzite. The Milligen is about 1, 850 feed thick. The Late Mississippian White Knob Formation is 2, 400 feet thick and has two members. The lower member is limestone interbedded with calcareous siltstone. Massive blue-gray limestone with some chert nodules characterizes the upper member. The undifferentiated Pennsylvanian-Permian unit is 1, 800 feet of mostly sandy limestone. Quartzite and calcareous sandstone are also present. Tertiary rocks are present {{in the form of an}} orangish-white tuff which is considered part of the Salt Lake Formation. Lake Bonneville Group, alluvial, and landslide deposits represent the Quaternary System. Most of these are unconsolidated silt, sand, and gravel deposits. However, the Lake bonneville Group displays a tightly cemented shore-line deposit in places. The effects of metamorphism are common in the area. The Milligen shows signs of <b>contact</b> and tectonic <b>metamorphism.</b> In places it has been bleached or altered to slate and phyllite. The White Knob Formation has been marblized at several locations. Igneous activity has emplaced two small dikes on the eastern flank of the Black Pine Mountains. Although they are highly altered, the original rock was apparently a diabase. The structure of the area is complex. Three low-angle thrust faults are present which are generally situated along bedding planes. The lower thrust fault separates the Jefferson and Milligen formations. The middle thrust fault intervenes at the Milligen-White Knob contact, Locally, this thrust fault has cut out the lower member of the White Knob. The upper thrust fault is present at the base of the undifferentiated Pennsylvanian-Permian strata. The upper thrust fault overlies the White Knob and, locally, the Milligen. Several high-angle faults are present which displace the low-angle thrust faults. A major range-front fault is present on the southeastern side of the range. Displacement on it may be as much as 6, 500 feet. Mineralization in the area occurred during two episodes. The first was guided by fractures related to Laramide structure. This episode was characterized by mesothermal deposits of sphalerite, tetrahedrite, and jamesonite. Following the first mineral deposition Basin-. and-Range faulting began. New fract!lres provided a locus for mesothermal and epithermal deposits of the second episode. Calcite, barite, and gold were deposited at this time.
