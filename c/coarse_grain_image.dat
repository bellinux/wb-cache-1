40|$|International audienceSediment {{transport}} processes at the sediment-water interface {{are usually}} studied using flume tests. Due to technical limitations, extreme hydro-sedimentary conditions are then rarely considered. Sediment profile imaging (SPI) {{is a widely}} used technique for mapping benthic habitat quality in soft sediments but several limitations exist that make the system ineffective for coarse or indurate sediment investigations and for transport processes studies. To address this problem, a modified system was designed to investigate these processes in situ, on a grain-size scale, with high temporal resolution. A dynamic sediment profile imaging (DySPI) system was constructed with a new mode of penetration, an appropriate design and an imaging system based on high-definition video recording. The supporting frame was instrumented with autonomous sensors to monitor boundary layer characteristics along with video observations. This system was deployed during spring tide on sediment characterized by a mixture of particle sizes dominated by <b>coarse</b> <b>grains.</b> Appropriate <b>image</b> processing allowed determination of the area of sediment entrained, movement threshold, size of moving particles, instantaneous transport rate and interface profile changes, in addition to usual SPI parameters. However, DySPI is a prototype and further development of the instrument and the image processing are possible to enlarge the scope presented in this study...|$|R

Peoogaphic and scanning eiectron microscopic (SEM) studies reveal different types of berthierine occulrences, including interlayers within and rims on deformed chlorite, intergrowths with muscovite and halloysite, and discrete <b>coarse</b> <b>grains.</b> TEM <b>images</b> show thick packets of berthierine and chlorite that are parallel or related by low-angle boundaries, and layer terminations of chlorite by berthierine; mixedJayer chlorite-berthierine also is observed, intergrown with Fe-rich chlorite and berthierine. End-member (Mg-free) berthierine is present in small domains in two samples. The Kidd Creek berthierine is chemically similar to berthierine from other localities, and to Fe-rich chlorite from a variety of geological settings. This is the first reported occurence of berthierine from volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits. Textural relations suggest hat most of the Kidd Creek berthierine formed as a primary hydrothermal mineral at relatively high temperatures (* 350 "C) in the footwall stringer zone, probably by the replacement of a pie-existing aluminous phase such as muscovite or chlorite.
