50|$|Based on an {{increase}} on-demand outsourcing concept in business platform, {{there has been}} a paradigm shift in the European market. The business outsourcing strategies now depend on five key factors, including <b>current</b> <b>sourcing</b> strategies in European markets, trends in the market, transition of services, contract laws and risks involved in outsourcing. According to a survey conducted among eight countries in Europe, Finland had 19% of its total goods and services using on-demand outsourcing while the United Kingdom and Spain were at 17%. Germany, the Netherlands and Norway had outsourced 15%, 13% and 10% of all services respectively. Notably, Sweden and Denmark had 9% of their service industries employing on-demand outsourcing. In addition, the survey revealed that the fundamental reasons for adopting this strategy was informed by three key issues.|$|E
50|$|No {{physical}} <b>current</b> <b>source</b> is ideal. For example, {{no physical}} <b>current</b> <b>source</b> can operate {{when applied to}} an open circuit. There are two characteristics that define a <b>current</b> <b>source</b> in real life. One is its internal resistance {{and the other is}} its compliance voltage. The compliance voltage is the maximum voltage that the <b>current</b> <b>source</b> can supply to a load. Over a given load range, it is possible for some types of real <b>current</b> <b>sources</b> to exhibit nearly infinite internal resistance. However, when the <b>current</b> <b>source</b> reaches its compliance voltage, it abruptly stops being a <b>current</b> <b>source.</b>|$|R
50|$|An ideal <b>current</b> <b>source</b> {{generates a}} <b>current</b> that is {{independent}} of the voltage changes across it. An ideal <b>current</b> <b>source</b> is a mathematical model, which real devices can approach very closely. If the current through an ideal <b>current</b> <b>source</b> can be specified independently of any other variable in a circuit, it is called an independent <b>current</b> <b>source.</b> Conversely, if the current through an ideal <b>current</b> <b>source</b> is determined by some other voltage or current in a circuit, it is called a dependent or controlled <b>current</b> <b>source.</b> Symbols for these sources are shown in Figure 2.|$|R

50|$|Current source density {{analysis}} (which {{could more}} accurately be called current source and sink density analysis) is {{the practice of}} placing a microelectrode in proximity to a nerve or a nerve cell to detect <b>current</b> <b>sourcing</b> from, or sinking into, their plasma membranes. When positive charges, for example, flow quickly across a plasma membrane {{to the inside of}} a cell (sink) this creates a transient cloud of negativity {{in the vicinity of the}} sink. This is because the flow of positive charges into the interior of the cell leaves behind uncompensated negative charges. A nearby micro-electrode with substantial tip resistance (on the order of 1 MΩ) can detect that negativity because a voltage difference will develop across the tip of the electrode (between the negativity outside the electrode, and the electroneutral environment inside the electrode). Put another way, the electrode internal solution will donate some of the positive charge needed to compensate the negativity caused by the current sink. Thus, the inside of the electrode will become negative relative to ground for as long as the extracellular negativity persists. The extracellular negativity will persist as long as the current sink is present. Thus, by measuring a negativity relative to ground, the electrode indirectly reports the presence of a nearby current sink. The size of the recorded negativity will vary directly with the size of the current sink and inversely with the distance between the electrode and the sink.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{proposes a}} soft {{switched}} Output <b>Current</b> <b>Sourcing</b> (OCS) grid connected inverter that applies a high frequency isolation transformer. <b>Current</b> <b>sourcing</b> at the output implies that, ideally, the injected current will {{be independent of}} the load voltage. The current injected to the line is controlled by varying the switching frequency and PWM at low currents. The system does not require the sensing of the output current or even the line voltage- except for synchronization. This is in contrast to the conventional voltage sourcing inverters where the small disturbance at the line voltage may lead to current run away and consequently a tight current feedback loop must be applied. The proposed topology and several proposed control approaches were analyzed and verified by simulations and by experiments. The simulation and experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis and show that the proposed inverter can be operated with no sensing of the line current or voltage except for synchronization.

40|$|Abstract- The use of topologies {{that have}} an output <b>current</b> <b>sourcing</b> {{behavior}} could be advantageous when driving constant voltage loads that call for the stabilization of the output current rather than output voltage. The load characteristic of the magnetron considered in this study can be modeled as a voltage source of about 3. 9 kV with a relatively small internal resistance of about 1. 5 kOhm {{that needs to be}} driven by a current of about 300 mA. This study proposes a one-stage, zero current switched, high voltage gain, and <b>current</b> <b>sourcing</b> converter, to drive such a load. The topology is based on the parallel resonant converter but includes blocking diodes at the input bridge to assist the soft switching operation. The theoretical analyses were verified by simulations and experimentally on a 1. 3 kW magnetron driver which was fed from a low voltage source in the range of 20 V to 32 V.

40|$|Grid {{connected}} inverters {{are important}} building blocks in renewable energy conversion systems. In conventional voltage sourcing grid connected inverters, any mismatch between the synthesized output waveforms of the inverters and the grid voltage will generate large erroneous currents unless a fast current feedback is used. The current control requires rather fast sampling rates and considerable DSP resources {{as well as}} independent hardware for protection. An alternative approach to the voltage sourcing design is to apply an inverter with an Output <b>Current</b> <b>Sourcing</b> (OCS) behaviour. <b>Current</b> <b>sourcing</b> at the output implies that, ideally, the injected current will be independent on the load voltage. This study describes a DSP control of a soft switched OCS grid connected inverter that applies a high frequency isolation transformer and does not include a costly resonant capacitor. All the required control and housekeeping functions are implemented on a TMS 320 F 2808 DSP core of Texas Instruments. The proposed topology and possible control approaches were tested on a 3. 5 kW prototype.
