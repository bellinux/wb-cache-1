5|$|Mr. Burns {{has all of}} his {{employees}} <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> highway maintained by his company. Not wishing to waste his Saturday, Homer fakes his death. The next day, Marge finds out and orders Homer {{to go to the}} Springfield Hall of Records to explain himself. While sorting out the problem, Homer gets into an argument with a clerk who claims that Homer's mother is still alive, in spite of Homer's belief that she died while he was young. Homer visits what he believes is her grave, only to discover that it belongs to Walt Whitman. Nearby, he sees his own grave and falls into it. A woman approaches and chastises Homer for falling into her son's grave. Homer realizes that the woman is his mother, Mona, and the two have an emotional reunion.|$|E

25|$|Myiasis is the {{infestation}} {{of living}} or necrotic tissue {{in a living}} host by fly larvae. Some flies may just lay their eggs in a festering wound, while other may infest unwounded tissue. C. cadaverina has occasionally been found in cases of myiasis but is not a fly that is regularly found. Myiasis is fairly uncommon in the United States, but tends to be very common {{in third world countries}} and can create a major problem with livestock, causing severe economic losses. Myiasis is different from maggot therapy in which physicians purposely use larvae of flies that feed on necrotic tissue in order to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> wound and aid healing. Maggot therapy can <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> wound that has been festering for months very quickly.|$|E

25|$|CERCLA {{was enacted}} by Congress in 1980 in {{response}} to the threat of hazardous waste sites, typified by the Love Canal disaster in New York, and the Valley of the Drums in Kentucky. The initial trust fund to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> site where a polluter could not be identified, could not or would not pay (bankruptcy or refusal) consisted of about $1.6 billion.|$|E
25|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} is a focal area of French development cooperation with Morocco. In 2007 the French Development Agency (AFD) supported projects with {{a value of}} Euro 130m for urban and rural water supply and Euro 145m for sanitation. Geographically the projects are concentrated in the Sebou river basin, in Agadir and in Nador. In Nador French aid contributes through a loan approved in 2007 {{to clean up the}} highly polluted lagoon of Nador, the largest lagoon in the Mediterranean. The clean-up plan for the bay is inspired by similar experiences in France (Contrats de Baie) under which different public players work together for the common goal to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> coastal bay.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1974, Bush Terminal {{was still}} an active port facility, with vessels that docked between its piers. In 1974, the City of New York Department of Ports and Terminals hired a private company to fill the spaces between Piers 1 through 4 to make space for parking {{shipping}} containers. Filling, however, was halted in 1978 after reports of environmental violations. New York City officials later learned that toxic wastes including oils, oil sludges, and wastewaters had been dumped at the site, making the four piers a polluted brownfield. In 2006, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Governor George Pataki announced a $36 million plan to clean up and redevelop the Bush Terminal piers. The plan included a $17.8 million grant {{from the state of}} New York, the largest single grant the state had ever awarded to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> brownfield site.|$|E

25|$|Depending on geology {{and soil}} type, pump and treat {{may be a}} good method to quickly reduce high {{concentrations}} of pollutants. It is more difficult to reach sufficiently low concentrations to satisfy remediation standards, due to the equilibrium of absorption/desorption processes in the soil. However, pump and treat is typically not the best form of remediation. It is expensive to treat the groundwater, and typically is a very slow process to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> release with pump and treat. It is best suited to control the hydraulic gradient and keep a release from spreading further. Better options of in-situ treatment often include air sparge/soil vapor extraction (AS/SVE) or dual phase extraction/multiphase extraction(DPE/MPE). Other methods include trying to increase the dissolved oxygen content of the groundwater to support microbial degradation of the compound (especially petroleum) by direct injection of oxygen into the subsurface, or the direct injection of a slurry that slowly releases oxygen over time (typically magnesium peroxide or calium oxy-hydroxide).|$|E
25|$|The {{nucleation}} reaction {{can start}} with any heterogeneous surface, such as rock salt, but Mentos {{have been found to}} work better than most. Tonya Coffey, a physicist at Appalachian State University, found that the aspartame in diet drinks lowers the surface tension in the water and causes a bigger reaction, but that caffeine does not accelerate the process. It has also been shown that a wide variety of beverage additives such as sugars, citric acid, and natural flavors can also enhance fountain heights. In some cases, dissolved solids that increase the surface tension of water (such as sugars) also increase fountain heights. These results suggest that additives serve to enhance geyser heights not by decreasing surface tension, but rather by decreasing bubble coalescence. Decreased bubble coalescence leads to smaller bubble sizes and greater foaming ability in water. Thus, the geyser reaction will still work even using sugared drinks, but diet is commonly used both {{for the sake of a}} larger geyser as well as to avoid having to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> sugary soda mess.|$|E

[...] Earp was described in the promotional copy as [...] "Deputy Sheriff to Bat Masterson of Dodge City, {{known as one of the}} three greatest gun-men that ever lived, along with Bat Masterson and 'Wild Bill' Hickok". In reality, Earp was a virtually unknown assistant marshal in Dodge City when Wild Bill Hickok was murdered in 1876.|$|E

He considered the mysteries of Alien to be alien in nature, and said, [...] "all the mysteries have alien players: the exoskeleton nightmare and... the elephantine titan that was called the 'space jockey'... How do you make anyone care about events between creatures like this?" [...] His solution was to link the alien mysteries {{to the past and}} future of humanity. He said: [...] "if that story is somehow ours and deeply enmeshed with the human story. That story changes meaning within our own life, things of such significance that we think of our own lives differently." [...] Spaihts found translating Scott's stylistic visual concepts to text difficult, and he periodically constrained some of Scott's ideas. He reminded Scott that in the scene they were discussing, the characters were subject to gravity and so could not simply float. By April 2010, the script was on the fourth draft. Scott said about the script, [...] "we are talking about gods and engineers. Engineers of space. And were the aliens designed as a form of biological warfare? Or biology that would go in and <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> planet?" [...] In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and ready for filming.|$|E

BISTRO was the first example of what later became known as synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).|$|E

2500|$|Despite the name, the Superfund {{trust fund}} lacks {{sufficient}} funds {{to clean up}} even {{a small number of}} the sites on the NPL. As a result, the EPA typically negotiates consent orders with PRPs to study sites and develop cleanup alternatives, subject to EPA oversight and approval of all such activities. The EPA then issues a Proposed Plans for remedial action for a site on which it takes public comment, after which it makes a cleanup decision in a Record of Decision (ROD). RODs are typically implemented under consent decrees by PRPs or under unilateral orders if consent cannot be reached. If a party fails to comply with such an order, it may be fined up to $37,500 for each day that non-compliance continues. A party that spends money to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> site may sue other PRPs in a contribution action under the CERCLA. CERCLA liability has generally been judicially established as joint and several among PRPs to the government for cleanup costs (i.e., each PRP is hypothetically responsible for all costs subject to contribution), but CERCLA liability is allocable among PRPs in contribution based on comparative fault. An [...] "orphan share" [...] is the share of costs at a Superfund site that is attributable to a PRP that is either unidentifiable or insolvent. The EPA tries to treat all PRPs equitably and fairly. Budgetary cuts and constraints can make more equitable treatment of PRPs more difficult.|$|E
