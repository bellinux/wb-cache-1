40|$|Many {{automotive}} {{components and}} sub-systems require viscoelastic damping treatments to control {{noise and vibration}} characteristics. To aid the dynamic design process, new approaches are needed for modeling of partial damping treatments and characterization of the overall dynamic behavior. The analytical component of the design process is illustrated via the transmission <b>casing</b> <b>cover,</b> along with supporting experiments. First, the vibration response of production casing plates is examined, with and without the constrained layer treatment. A modified flat plate is employed along with a generic housing that provides the realistic boundary conditions for subsequent work. A simplified analytical damping model for constrained viscoelastic layer damping is suggested based on assumed modal functions. Using the analytical model, design guidelines in terms of optimal patch shapes and locations are suggested. Natural frequency shifts associated with patch damping treatments are predicted and successfully compared with measured data...|$|E
40|$|A {{corrosion}} {{investigation was}} done at MODAR, Inc., using a supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) vessel reactor. Several types of multilayered ceramic rings and experimental nickel alloy coupons were exposed to a chlorinated cutting oil TrimSol, in the SCWO process. A corrosion casing was designed and mounted in the vessel reactor with precautions to minimize chances of degrading {{the integrity of the}} pressure vessel. Fifteen of the ceramic coated rings were stacked vertically in the casing at one time for each test. There was a total of 36 rings. The rings were in groupings of three rings that formed five sections. Each section saw a different SCWO environment, ranging from 650 to 300 {degrees}C. The metal coupons were mounted on horizontal threaded holders welded to a vertical rod attached to the <b>casing</b> <b>cover</b> in order to hang {{down the middle of the}} casing.

This {{study was designed to}} identify the source, risk factors, and clinical consequences of an outbreak of aluminum intoxication in hemodialysis patients using case-control and cohort studies. In 1991, a dialysis center in Pennsylvania [Dialysis Center A (DCA) ] identified a number of patients with elevated serum aluminum levels. All patients receiving dialysis at DCA during January 1, 1987 to March 26, 1992 were involved in the study. A case-patient was defined as any patient with a serum aluminum level ≥ 100 µ/liter after ≥ 5 dialysis sessions at DCA. Fifty-nine case-patients were identified. Risk factors for elevated serum aluminum levels were receipt of bicarbonate- (rather than acetate-) based dialysate, higher number of sessions using bicarbonate dialysis, receipt of acid concentrate (used in bicarbonate dialysis) passed through one of two electric pumps, and a greater number of sessions using this concentrate. The electric pumps had an aluminum casing, <b>casing</b> <b>cover,</b> and impeller. Elevated levels of aluminum were found in acid concentrate after passing through a pump. Seizures and mental status changes requiring hospitalization were associated with aluminum exposure. We found that epidemic aluminum intoxication was caused by the use of an electric pump with aluminum housing to deliver acid concentrate used in bicarbonate dialysis. This outbreak demonstrates why it is essential to insure that all fluid pathways, storage tanks, central delivery systems, and pumps are compatible with low pH fluids before converting from acetate to bicarbonate dialysis...|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3, noise {{reduction}} is improved by housing electrodes in box-shaped metal casings. The {{distance from the}} tip of each electrode to its dedicated amplifier is kept short at ~  10  cm, amplifiers are mounted inside the metal electrode casings, and those metal <b>casings</b> <b>cover</b> the entire region near the heart to act as noise shielding. Further, since electrodes are pushed into the interior of the housings with body contact, metal casings are drawn closer to the body-surface to increase noise shielding during measurement. Effective shielding has been demonstrated up to 71.92 μT, which is {{in the vicinity of the}} 60  Hz, 83.3 μT guideline value of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Further, when measurements were made intentionally exposing the measurement platform to high amplitude electromagnetic radiation (noise), some noise effects were observable but large differences in measurement values between the high-noise and normal environment were not observed. Accordingly, noise shielding is sufficient to measure body-surface potential under normal (low radiation) conditions. In addition, electrode casings are joined in a ball-joint fashion allowing independent movement and rotation. Each electrode casing can incline independently to conform to the contour of the body making it easy to establish reliable contact with accurate electrode positioning.|$|R

5000|$|During the {{planning}} stages, {{one of the}} primary considerations that the well engineer takes into account is the density (or [...] "weight") of the drilling fluid. It must be heavy enough to suppress the pressure in exposed permeable formations (thus avoiding a blowout), and yet light enough to avoid breaking down the rock itself. Both parameters generally increase with depth, and create a window in which the drilling fluid density is safe. However, the mud density required to suppress fluid pressures at, say, 9000' would usually break down the formation further up the well at, say, 1000'. Therefore, the well is drilled in sections by running <b>casing</b> strings to <b>cover</b> depth ranges between which the required mud densities are suitable for that entire range. However, each bit must be smaller than the previous casing string, which in turn has to be smaller than the previous hole.|$|R

Certain bacteria in this casing {{are responsible for}} this stimulation, which is known as pinning. Bacterial species richness and diversity within peat and peat-based casing mixtures made from industrial waste materials (i. e. those containing coir, wattle bark, bagasse and filter cake) were examined using {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) at three phases of mushroom growth: (1) casing, (2) pinning and (3) harvesting. Results from the DGGE established that higher bacterial species richness occurred at pinning and harvesting than at casing. Increases in bacterial population density at pinning were greater in the peat-based mixtures, which contained industrial waste materials, than in peat alone. Peat mixtures containing these alternative materials are therefore favourable substrates for bacterial growth. The DGGE profiles for pasteurised casing materials reflected their ability to rapidly re-establish the original bacterial community. The bacteria found to be dominant in casing materials during pinning were closely related to Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, alpha-Proteobacterium, beta-Proteobacterium, gamma-Proteobacterium, delta-Proteobacterium and uncultured species...|$|R

40|$|The {{conclusion}} of a previous experiment showed that the compost quantity was the most determining parameter for the production volume of mushrooms, despite the addition of hemi cellulose as carbon source to the compost. The present experiment focuses on the mycelium action {{with regard to the}} carbon availability in the compost. Two factors were studied: (1) The effect of breaking the mycelium at a predetermined depth in the compost layer and before the first mushrooms flush. The hypothesis was that mycelium which is no longer in contact with the mycelium in the casing material would free the carbon nutrition in the lower compost layer. This increased amount of free carbon would be beneficial during the budding. It was expected that breaking the compost layer during the growth of the mycelium would increase the amount of buds. The observed effect of breaking the mycelium is that the formation of buds is delayed in comparison with the reference. (2) The effect of distributing the compost in a longer layer which remains partly uncovered by casing material. The compost is distributed into a thin layer with 2 - 3 times the surface area of the reference. The <b>casing</b> material just <b>covers</b> the same surface area of the compost as in the reference. The hypothesis is that the mycelium can exploit the total extended compost layer and increase the mushroom production in correlation with the volume of compost accessible, but independent of the surface of the casing material.

40|$|In {{many areas}} of the Midwestern United States, a safe and {{plentiful}} supply of groundwater is a primary concern. Groundwater is sporadic, unreliable, shallow, and often polluted, even though these same areas often have an annual rainfall in excess of 1 m. The pollution problems associated with these groundwater supplies are both chemical and bacterial. Older wells are often the most dangerous. Linings made of open brick near the surface, cracked <b>casings</b> and <b>covers,</b> and nearby privy, septic tank, and barnyard sites accentuate the problems in shallow groundwater aquifers. High levels of nitrates frequently present in the shallow domestic well water of Illinois were recognized as a health problem by Weart (1948). A preliminary study by Smith et al. (1970) in Washington County, Illinois, of 213 dug wells (2. 1 - 9. 2 m deep), 31 drilled wells, and 72 farm ponds showed that water from 73. 4 percent of the dug wells exceeded the U. S. Public Health Standard of 10 mg/ 1 nitrate nitrogen. Only 19. 3 percent of the drilled wells exceeded the standard for safe drinking water. All the ponds sampled were found to be well below the U. S. Public Health Standard for nitrate content. Pryor (1956) has reported that because of the geology of the area groundwater supplies in most of Washington County, Illinois, are inadequate. The geologic situation makes successful drilled wells almost nonexistent. Existing low-quality and low-yielding wells are being supplemented by cisterns, transported water, and some ponds. An economic analysis of farm water supplies in Washington County by Moore (1972) revealed that present well water systems are the least costly available, but the quality and quantity make most of these sources unreliable. Alternatives considered by Moore included farm ponds, municipal water supplies, transported water, and various combinations of these potential sources. Moore concluded that farm ponds with a treatment system {{could be one of the}} more satisfactory sources of water provided storage is available to meet demands during a prolonged drought. The data reported by Smith et al. (19 7 0) concerning nitrate levels in Washington County ponds were from samples collected during late spring. Hill et al. (1962) reported an average maximum level of 3. 1 mg/ 1 of nitrate nitrogen occurred in 14 Ohio ponds with a mean value of 0. 17 mg/ 1. Hill also reported that maximum values for some chemical parameters occurred during early spring months. The authors felt that ponds in Washington County could potentially exceed the public health limit for nitrate because contamination could occur from the same sources causing widespread groundwater contamination. Also, it was felt that differences in watershed types could influence the quality of pond water. Pryor (1956), Smith (1970), and Moore (1972) have shown that Washington County needs an alternate water supply to existing low-quality wells. A project was initiated in December 1970 to determine seasonal and monthly fluctuations of several water quality parameters in farm ponds having different watershed types. Additionally, the premise that Washington County farm ponds could provide water of acceptable quality to repace existing low-quality wells was considered...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, two {{different}} ASTM C 618 Class C fly ashes (FA) {{were used for}} the production of aluminum metal matrix composites (MMCs) using powder metallurgy (PM) technology. Calcareous FAs were sampled from the electrostatic precipitators of {{two different}} lignite-fired power stations: from Megalopolis, Southern Greece (MFA) and from Kardia, Northen Greece (KFA), under maximum electricity load. FAs were milled {{in order to reduce the}} mean particle diameter and Aluminum-FA composites containing 10 % and 20 % of FA were then prepared and compacted. The green products were sintered for 2 h at 600 °C. Sintered Al-FA MMCs showed increased hardness and wear resistance suggesting their possible use in industrial applications for example in <b>covers,</b> <b>casings,</b> brake rotors or engine blocks. As most possible industrial applications of MMCs not only require wear resistance, but also corrosion resistance in different mild aggressive medias, this paper aims to study the electrochemical behavior of FA MMCs in order to evaluate their corrosion resistance. The morphology and chemical composition of the phases in the Aluminum-FA composite samples were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS). Moreover, topographic and Volta potential maps were acquired by Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKP-FM). Volta potential maps provide information about the electrochemical behavior of the different phases in absence of electrolyte. The electrochemical behavior was investigated by Open Circuit Potential measurements and potentiodynamic polarization, while the corrosion mechanisms were studied by SEM observations after different times of immersion in a mild corrosive medium. In all cases it could be stated that the addition of the FA particles into the Al matrix might cause an increase of the hardness and mechanical properties of the pure aluminum but deteriorates the corrosion resistance. The degradation phenomena occurring on the FA containing samples might be related to the following mechanisms: 1) Partial detachment or dissolution of the FA soluble phases, in particular based on Si, Fe and Ca; 2) dissolution of the Al matrix surrounding the FA particles due to crevice corrosion; 3) Al localized dissolution due to galvanic coupling between the Fe-rich intermetallics and the matrix. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.
