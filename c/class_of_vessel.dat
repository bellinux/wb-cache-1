25|$|It {{was here}} the first {{improvements}} in modelling took place, the old-fashioned counter was abolished, {{and all the}} planking turned up to the arch-board; the old-fashioned stern-frame and transoms were done away with, and the vessel framed all round the stern. The first clipper stem was her put up that was seen on the Wear, and was, {{as it was then}} termed, turned inside out and upside down, and which is still continued by the builders on the Wear up to the present day.(1874). Pile was the first to introduce the Clipper <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> to Sunderland and by his skill in building them he gained recognition in the nautical world.|$|E
25|$|Salvor is {{the third}} ship of the {{auxiliary}} rescue and salvage <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> constructed for the US Navy. The rugged construction of this steel-hulled vessel, combined with her speed and endurance, make Salvor well-suited for rescue and salvage operations throughout the world. The hull below the waterline is ice-strengthened. Her propulsion plant can develop 4200 shaft horsepower with four Caterpillar399 diesel engines coupled in pairs to two shafts. She is fitted with a Controllable Reversible Pitch (CRP) propeller within a Kort nozzle on each shaft. The CRP propeller/Kort nozzle combination produces greater thrust and more maneuverability control than conventional propellers. Salvor is also configured with a bow thruster which provides athwartship thrust for additional control of the bow when the ship's speed is less than five knots (9km/h).|$|E

2500|$|The {{design of}} the R. J. Hackett was innovative. [...] With its boxy hull, hatch-lined deck, and {{placement}} of the deckhouses, the ship was ideally suited for moving cargo through inland waterways. [...] The fore and aft deckhouses gave the Hackett a single immense hold that could be easily accessed and filled with cargo. [...] The boxy hull maximized cargo volume, and the hatch spacing lined the ship up perfectly with the ore dock chutes in Marquette, Michigan and elsewhere, and the center section free of rigging made loading the ship much easier. [...] The forward pilothouse gave the captain better vision and quicker reaction to dangers in the water. [...] The Hacketts design combined the best aspects of steam and sailing ships into a new <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|E

60|$|The {{next step}} in {{reducing}} armament and increasing speed, produced the protected cruiser, which carries no armour belt, but retains the protective deck, upon the sloping sides of which is stored the coal. The turrets disappear altogether, and there is usually only one 8-inch gun, the battery being principally made up of 4-inch rapid-fire guns and 6, 4, and 1-pounders. As this <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> {{is not able to}} cope with the armoured cruiser, it must be faster, for the general principle holds good that the weaker the vessel becomes in point of offensive weapons or defensive armour, the greater the necessity that she should be able to run away. The best types of the protected cruiser in the navy may be found in the Columbia and Minneapolis, which have a speed of about twenty-seven miles an hour.|$|E

It returns in gloomy silence, broken by the occasional hoot of the long-shore loafer, after issuing a bulletin which though it may enlighten the professional mind does not exhilarate the layman. Meantime the enemy triumphs, wirelessly, far and wide. A few frigid and perfunctory-seeming contradictions are put forward against his resounding claims; a Naval expert or two is heard talking [...] "off"; the rest is silence. Anon, the enemy, after a prodigious amount of explanation which not even the neutrals seem to take any interest in, revises his claims, and, very modestly, enlarges his losses. Still no sign. After weeks there appears a document giving our version of the affair, which is as colourless, detached, and scrupulously impartial as {{the findings of a}} prize-court. It opines that the list of enemy losses which it submits [...] "give the minimum in regard to numbers though it is possibly not entirely accurate in regard to the particular <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel,</b> especially those that were sunk during the night attacks." [...] Here the matter rests and remains--just like our blockade. There is an insolence about it all that makes one gasp.|$|E
