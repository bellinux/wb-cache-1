25|$|In early May 1948, the Jewish {{provisional}} government, {{known as}} Minhelet Ha'am, {{did not have}} its own postage stamps ready, so it used existing labels, both JNF labels, which otherwise have been printed since 1902 for fundraising purposes, and local <b>community</b> tax <b>stamps.</b> The JNF labels were given a Hebrew overprint meaning postage (doar), (as shown in the picture), whereas local <b>community</b> tax <b>stamps</b> were not given overprints. The JNF stamps were printed from May 3 to 14, 1948, their sale ended on May 14, 1948, with remaining stocks ordered to be returned and destroyed. Use of these stamps was tolerated until May 22, 1948. The Mandate's postal rates remained unchanged during this period.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1930s Stamp {{formed the}} Land Utilisation Survey of Britain, a major project to {{survey of the}} whole country using volunteers {{including}} colleagues, students, school teachers and pupils, {{on a scale of}} 6 inches to a mile. Publication of maps and reports began in 1933 and was completed in 1948, after interruption by World War II [...] Stamp reported on the reaction of a farmer who came across a school class doing land-use survey on his land. Angry at first, the farmer was pacified by the explanation of the schoolmaster, and then later wrote approvingly to his local newspaper that this approach was valuable both to the pupils and the <b>community.</b> <b>Stamp</b> went on to act as a consultant to many national governments and prepared a general scheme for a world land use survey which was adopted by the International Geographical Union.|$|R
5000|$|Tommy Lucchese was underboss for Tommaso Gagliano, {{who was one}} of {{the members}} of the Mafia commission. The New York City underworld was {{organized}} and peaceful because of Charles [...] "Lucky" [...] Luciano, but he was soon arrested in 1936 on compulsory prostitution charges and then deported in 1946. Gagliano would keep his family during a tough time, being outnumbered in the Commission by the Bonanno family, Magaddino family, Profaci family and the Mangano family alliance. The Gagliano family during WWII was involved in black market sugar, gasoline rations, <b>stamps,</b> and <b>meat.</b> In 1946, Lucchese attended the mob Havana Conference in Cuba as Gagliano's representative.|$|R
50|$|The Malagasy Republic was proclaimed on 14 October 1958, as an {{autonomous}} state within the French <b>Community.</b> The first <b>stamps</b> {{of the republic}} were issued in December 1958. Paositra Malagasy is the postal service provider.|$|R
50|$|But {{after years}} of steady effort, Maloney and the Hindu <b>community</b> got their <b>stamp.</b> In October 2016, the nation's first Diwali Stamp was issued and the first-day-of-issue {{dedication}} ceremony {{took place at the}} Consulate General of India in New York City.|$|R
5000|$|The first Europa {{issue was}} on 15 September 1956.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to writing, McGuire {{has been an}} innovator in her field. She is {{the inventor of the}} [...] "Duo-Stamp", a two-sided rubber stamp with an inverse and converse design that is popular with the <b>stamping</b> <b>community.</b> [...] Her [...] "Bead Prints" [...] have been described as [...] "amazingly artistic products of great quality and usefulness".|$|R
5000|$|Goodman said {{he would}} welcome any {{investigation}} from any source {{and that he would}} co-operate fully with it. He said he was astounded by the allegations made in the programme. He said that the malpractices alleged during the programme in relation to <b>stamping</b> and weighing <b>meat</b> had never been carried out in a [...] "routine fashion", and if they had taken place they had done so without his knowledge or consent.He said systems that meant payment of £3 million in non-taxable wages to employees had existed but that this had been ended.|$|R
500|$|Reviewer Daisy Aldan of World Literature Today criticized Angelou for {{harboring}} [...] "a fanatic hostility expressed {{toward all}} white people", but writer Lyman B. Hagen disagreed, stating that like Angelou's friend and mentor Langston Hughes, Angelou explained and illuminated {{the condition of}} African Americans, but without alienating her readers. Angelou promoted the importance of hard work, a common theme in slave narratives, throughout all her autobiographies, in order to break the African-American stereotype of laziness. [...] Her description of the strong and cohesive Black <b>community</b> of <b>Stamps</b> demonstrated how African Americans have subverted repressive institutions to withstand racism. [...] Angelou evolved from wishing that she could become white in Caged Bird to later shedding her self-loathing and embracing a strong racial identity.|$|R
5000|$|Caged Bird {{has been}} called [...] "perhaps the most aesthetically {{satisfying}} autobiography written {{in the years immediately}} following the Civil Rights era". Critic Pierre A. Walker expresses a similar sentiment, and places it in the African-American literature tradition of political protest. Angelou demonstrates, through her involvement with the Black <b>community</b> of <b>Stamps,</b> as well as her presentation of vivid and realistic racist characters and [...] "the vulgarity of white Southern attitudes toward African Americans", her developing understanding of the rules for surviving in a racist society. Angelou's autobiographies, beginning with Caged Bird, contain a sequence of lessons about resisting oppression. The sequence she describes leads Angelou, as the protagonist, from [...] "helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance, and finally to outright and active protest".|$|R

50|$|V. O. Stamps {{was born}} in {{and raised in the}} <b>Stamps</b> <b>Community</b> in Upshur County, Texas, and was a key {{individual}} in early gospel music publishing. As a youth, he worked with his father in a sawmill, and used his earnings to purchase every gospel songbook he could find. In 1907 he attended the singing school of Richard M. Morgan. Sometime after that, his father bought a small store and V. O. worked there while teaching singing schools until 1914.|$|R
500|$|Angelou portrays Momma as {{a realist}} whose patience, courage, and silence ensured the {{survival}} {{and success of}} those who came after her. For example, Maya responds assertively when subjected to demeaning treatment by Mrs. Cullinan, her white employer, and, {{later on in the}} book, breaks the race barrier to become the first black streetcar operator in San Francisco. In addition, Angelou's description of the strong and cohesive black <b>community</b> of <b>Stamps</b> demonstrates how African Americans subvert repressive institutions to withstand racism. Arensberg insists that Angelou demonstrates how she, as a Black child, evolves out of her [...] "racial hatred", common in the works of many contemporary Black novelists and autobiographers. At first Maya wishes that she could become white, since growing up Black in white America is dangerous; later she sheds her self-loathing and embraces a strong racial identity.|$|R
2500|$|Documents feature {{prominently}} in {{all manner of}} business and personal affairs. Almost any type of document may become disputed in an investigation or litigation. For example, a questioned document may be {{a sheet of paper}} bearing handwriting or mechanically-produced text such as a ransom note, a forged cheque, or a business contract. It may be material not normally thought of as a 'document'. FDEs define the word [...] "document" [...] in a very broad sense as being any material bearing marks, signs, or symbols intended to convey a message or meaning to someone. This encompasses traditional paper documents but also includes things like graffiti on a wall, <b>stamp</b> impressions on <b>meat</b> products, or covert markings hidden in a written letter, among others.|$|R
25|$|In {{response}} to the various problems associated with living in Cabrini–Green, residents organized over the years both to pressure the city for assistance and to protect and support each other. <b>Community</b> leader Marion <b>Stamps</b> was the most visible Cabrini tenant to organize strikes and protests against the Chicago Housing Authority, Mayor of Chicago and many others on behalf of Cabrini residents from the 1960s until her death in 1996. In 1996, the federal government mandated the destruction of 18,000 units of public housing in Chicago (along {{with tens of thousands}} of other units nationwide).|$|R
500|$|Many of the {{problems}} Maya encounters in her childhood stem from the overt racism of her white neighbors. Although Mamma is relatively wealthy because she owns the general store {{at the heart of}} Stamps' Black community, the white children of their town hassle Maya's family relentlessly. One of these [...] "powhitetrash" [...] girls, for example, reveals her pubic hair to Momma in a humiliating incident. Early in the book, Momma hides Uncle Willie in a vegetable bin to protect him from Ku Klux Klan raiders. Maya has to endure the insult of her name being changed to Mary by a racist employer. A white speaker at her eighth grade graduation ceremony disparages the Black audience by suggesting that they have limited job opportunities. A white dentist refuses to treat Maya's rotting tooth, even when Momma reminds him that she had loaned him money during the Depression. The Black <b>community</b> of <b>Stamps</b> enjoys a moment of racial victory when they listen to the radio broadcast of Joe Louis's championship fight, but generally, they feel the heavy weight of racist oppression.|$|R
50|$|The United States Postal Service's {{first foray}} into {{self-adhesive}} stamps was in 1974 with the 10-cent dove weathervane, produced by Avery Dennison, that soon became discolored due to the instability of the adhesive. It was another 15 years (1989) before another such stamp was issued by the USPS. Stamp collectors criticized the format, as the rubber base adhesive used tended to progressively yellow the stamps. They also found them difficult to remove from covers, and to save in mint condition, though self-adhesives of recent years have improved in these respects. The British Post Office first issued self-adhesive stamps on October 19, 1993, {{with the introduction of}} books of 20 First Class stamps, later a 2nd class stamp was introduced. In later years other issues were produced in the self-adhesive format. Die cutting tools for the UK self adhesive stamps were manufactured by Arden Dies of Stockport, Cheshire using tools designed by Robert Clapham. Outside of the philatelic <b>community,</b> the <b>stamps</b> have been welcomed as more convenient; by 2002, virtually all new USPS stamps were issued as self-adhesives.|$|R

5000|$|The {{organisation}} works variously with {{parts of}} the TUC and other trade union organisations, the National Garment Workers Federation and closely cooperates with the Ethical Threads clothing company in Britain. It is also aligned with other campaign groups like Labour Behind the Label, and with [...] "No Sweat Apparel" [...] in the United States. Independent of political influence, the group seeks {{to reach out to}} all {{parts of the}} global <b>community</b> to help <b>stamp</b> out sweatshop labour fullstop - often dealing directly with groups of workers that would normally have no voice and no support outside their immediate community - for example Batay Ouvriye in Haiti and individuals like jailed union official Ali Nejati in Iran.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{for some time}} that, in most situations, appropriate investment by private enterprise in sea ranching and stock enhancement requires that they have adequate property rights in the released animals (Hanson 1974). This presentation considers {{a number of different}} ways in which property rights or de facto property rights may achieve this fundamental objective. The English common law has, for the purpose of describing the rights of ownership of animals, divided animals into two classes, those the subject of absolute ownership (domitae naturae) and those the subject of a limited property right (ferae naturae). The principles underlying those concepts follow the Roman law concepts, as adopted in much of Europe. Domitae naturae consists of a number of populations of animals (e. g. cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, dogs, cats, etc.). As a class domitae naturae are generally tame and capable of living about humans. They are populations of animals useful to humans, identifiable as a population and are populations over which humans effect a level of subjugation or control. The law gives effect to this <b>community</b> recognition, <b>stamping</b> on the <b>community</b> the concept that an animal of that class belongs to somebody...|$|R
5000|$|The {{village of}} New Earswick was {{built as a}} genuine mixed community. There was housing for both workers and managers, in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees. It was founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree, who was quoted as saying, [...] "I {{do not want to}} {{establish}} <b>communities</b> bearing the <b>stamp</b> of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities". The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin, after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust (now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust) was established to continue building and manage the new village. The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.|$|R

40|$|Due to {{its high}} social danger and {{far-reaching}} consequences, trafficking in human beings, {{as a form}} of transnational crime, needs an all-inclusive international approach in countries of origin, transit and destination. That means the use of effective measures concerning prevention, punishment of perpetrators and protection of victims. In connection with that, intensive efforts of the international <b>community</b> in <b>stamping</b> out this phenomenon marked the end of 20 ™ century. They are incarnated in a numerous of international documents and other activities, which particular emphasize the need of criminalization of trafficking in human beings in national legislation. In the paper, authors are analyzing international documents that are both directly or indirectly dealing with this topic, as well as criminal law provisions of a number of countries (USA, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Southern Europe). The aim of such an approach is to perceive our legislation though the prism of the contemporary tendencies, as well as to point out certain shortages and the importance of harmonizing our legislature with the international standards and demands of the international community. The first step toward that should be inclusion of trafficking in human beings as a separate criminal offence in the Criminal Code of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Victimology Society of Serbia drafted such criminal law provision, which is presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{contribution}} of community secondary schools to girls’ empowerment and the change of society’s attitude towards girls in education in Biharamulo District. The study examines {{the extent to which}} the increase of community secondary schools in Biharamulo District has removed a wrong perception in the society members about the role of education to girls. The study used a cross-sectional survey and a case study research design in which a single case study was employed. The cross-sectional survey aimed at collecting data from large number of samples of various categories at a particular time so as to describe the nature of the problem while single case study research design was used to collect qualitative data. The methods of data collection used were questionnaires, interview and documentary review. Major findings of the study show that there are some positive contributions of community secondary schools but yet empowerment of women has remained far behind and more efforts are still needed to realize this. Moreover, findings indicate that there is a general feeling that there are still deep rooted cultural practices that hinder the efforts to empowerment of girls in Biharamulo District Council especially in rural settings and still there is very little sensitization for parents to value education for girls. The study recommends on how the government should help alleviate the problem by inexorably educating the general public in Biharamulo District on the importance of educating a girl child and the government to increase commitment and collaborating with the <b>community</b> in <b>stamping</b> out deep rooted undesirable socio-cultural practices that impinge upon girls’educational achievement. ...|$|R
5000|$|FBI Special Agent Joseph O'Brien {{states in}} Boss of Bosses that after Amato married Paul Castellano's daughter, Constance, Castellano set Amato {{up in the}} {{legitimate}} business world as a distributor of Italian ice. Castellano greatly misjudged Amato who did not share the same keen business sense as Castellano and the Italian ice distribution business failed. Castellano put Amato {{to work as a}} butcher at his successful Meat Palace, a butcher shop franchise owned by Castellano and his sons. As a butcher employed at Dial Meat Purveyors Inc. and the Meat Market, he was involved in the selling of rancid and expired meat products. Although Amato had little formal school education, he could quarter a lamb with great skill and was knowledgeable about tallow. In of Bosses: The FBI and Paul Castellano, FBI Special Agent Joseph O'Brien suggests that at Dial Meat and the Meat Market he was taught by Castellano's men how to bleach tainted, outdated, uninspected meats or meats of a dubious provenance by using a white preservative powder known as [...] "dynamite" [...] that gave the faded, discolored meat a healthy fresh red appearance. Frank was also shown how to drain meat of any foul smelling juices it had accumulated by using formaldehyde and use counterfeit United States Department of Agriculture <b>stamps</b> to assign <b>meats</b> a false grade or expiration date. O'Brien would also state that at Castellano's meat suppliers he would have Amato and fellow butchers carve meat and label it as [...] "beef" [...] that was not always carved from cows and [...] "pork" [...] that was not always carved from pigs.|$|R
