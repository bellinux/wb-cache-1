25|$|CD-RW is a re-recordable {{medium that}} uses a {{metallic}} alloy instead of a dye. The write laser {{in this case is}} used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, and so many earlier <b>CD</b> <b>audio</b> players cannot read CD-RW discs, although most later <b>CD</b> <b>audio</b> players and stand-alone DVD players can. CD-RWs follow the Orange Book standard.|$|E
25|$|Apple also {{experimented with}} a number of other {{unsuccessful}} consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including digital cameras, portable <b>CD</b> <b>audio</b> players, speakers, video consoles, the eWorld online service, and TV appliances. Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued Newton division based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts. Ultimately, none of these products helped and Apple's market share and stock prices continued to slide.|$|E

25|$|MP3 {{compression}} {{works by}} reducing (or approximating) {{the accuracy of}} certain components of sound that {{are considered to be}} beyond the hearing capabilities of most humans. This method is commonly referred to as perceptual coding, or psychoacoustic modeling. The remaining audio information is then recorded in a space-efficient manner. Compared to CD-quality digital audio, MP3 compression can commonly achieve a 75 to 95% reduction in size. For example, an MP3 encoded at a constant bitrate of 128kbit/s would result in a file approximately 9% the size of the original <b>CD</b> <b>audio.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} ported in four months, during {{development}} of the Sega Genesis version. While it does feature some slight graphical upgrades and changes, the game largely looks and plays the same as its Genesis counterpart. Neil Harding wrote a program to convert the code from 68000 assembly language into C++ code which was used on the Saturn and the PC versions. The code was ported in three months, then an additional month was spent adding graphical enhancements. It features a higher quality opening video, higher quality graphics and an entirely new, <b>CD</b> <b>audio</b> soundtrack composed by Richard Jacques. Sonic Team filled in for {{development of the}} special stage in the Saturn version of the game, which includes polygonal graphics as opposed to sprites only.|$|E
25|$|A {{sample rate}} of 44.1kHz is {{commonly}} used for music reproduction, because this is also used for <b>CD</b> <b>audio,</b> the main source used for creating MP3 files. A great variety of bit rates are used on the Internet. A bit rate of 128kbit/s {{is commonly used}}, at a compression ratio of 11:1, offering adequate audio quality in a relatively small space. As Internet bandwidth availability and hard drive sizes have increased, higher bit rates up to 320kbit/s are widespread. Uncompressed audio as stored on an audio-CD has a bit rate of 1,411.2kbit/s, (16 bit/sample × 44100 samples/second × 2 channels / 1000 bits/kilobit), so the bitrates 128, 160 and 192kbit/s represent compression ratios of approximately 11:1, 9:1 and 7:1 respectively.|$|E

25|$|Bitrate is {{the product}} of the sample rate and number of bits per sample used to encode the music. <b>CD</b> <b>audio</b> is 44100 samples per second. The number of bits per sample also depends on the number of audio channels. CD is stereo and 16 bits per channel. So, {{multiplying}} 44100 by 32 gives 1411200—the bitrate of uncompressed CD digital audio. MP3 was designed to encode this 1411kbit/s data at 320kbit/s or less. As less complex passages are detected by MP3 algorithms then lower bitrates may be employed. When using MPEG-2 instead of MPEG-1, MP3 supports only lower sampling rates (16000, 22050 or 24000 samples per second) and offers choices of bitrate as low as 8kbit/s but no higher than 160kbit/s. By lowering the sampling rate, MPEG-2 layer III removes all frequencies above half the new sampling rate that may have been present in the source audio.|$|E
500|$|On July 2017, two new Blu-ray {{releases}} {{of the film}} were announced. First, a 4K remaster, and later a Blu-ray 3D release of the 3D conversion due out in August 2017. These re-releases would include new extras, including trailers, making-of documentaries, and [...] "Seamless Branching of the Theatrical cut, Director's Cut and Special extended edition".

500|$|Rebirth {{has been}} adapted into {{multiple}} media since its release. It inspired a five volume book series, released from February until November 2005. Guidebooks and art books {{have also been}} released for the title. It also inspired a manga retelling of the story, published through 2005. The comics were collected into two anthologies released on April 25 and May 27, 2005 respectively. The story was also adapted into a <b>CD</b> <b>audio</b> drama series, released in four parts between October 2005 and February 2006 under the umbrella title [...] To commemorate the PSP port, a new audio drama, titled , was created. It was released as a limited pre-order addition, and contained voice actor interviews and stage videos from Jump Festa 2008.|$|E
500|$|Even {{before the}} release of Dark Forces, Justin Chin had planned out Katarn's role in Dark Forces II, {{indicating}} that Katarn would face a [...] "big trial" [...] {{in a game that}} would be a [...] "rite of passage." [...] Chin became project leader for Dark Forces II. In the game, the digital audio from Dark Forces was replaced with <b>CD</b> <b>audio.</b> Dark Forces II adds two [...] "Jedi" [...] aspects to the series; the use of The Force and the lightsaber. The Force plays an integral role in how the player plays the game. The method of allocating credits to Force powers was designed with an RPG style in mind, allowing the player the choice of which powers to improve. Chin said in an early interview that progress through the game is based upon the abilities the player develops. A new game engine, the Sith engine, was developed for Dark Forces II, which uses both 3D graphics and sound. It {{was one of the first}} games to adopt the use of 3D graphics hardware acceleration using Microsoft Direct3D. Another development was that Dark Forces II moved on from the static images between levels used in Dark Forces to full motion video cutscenes. The characters are represented by live actors while the backgrounds are pre-rendered. The cutscenes included the first lightsaber footage filmed since Return of the Jedi in 1983. Dark Forces II also introduced multiplayer gaming to the series, allowing players to play online or via a LAN.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Klepacki {{met with}} Westwood Studios {{developers}} {{to discuss the}} soundtrack of the company's next project—Command & Conquer. To define the game's style, Klepacki listened {{to a number of}} bands, including Nine Inch Nails and Ministry, which would supply the iconic industrial style found in the majority of the songs. He combined various elements of this music and added his own touch to create a unique sound. With the company's recent shift to 22 kHz audio, Klepacki composed with an ASR-10 sampler, a Roland S760 sampler, a Roland JD 990 synth module, and an electric guitar. The first few songs he composed for Command & Conquer contained voice samples—including the notable pieces Act on Instinct and No Mercy (which featured wild declarations from Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey). The samples were later found to interfere with the game's spoken audio, and were replaced with versions lacking the voices, although the original versions (and several other unused pieces) can still be found on the DOS C and Covert Operations discs. Complete versions of the songs later appeared on the game's commercial soundtrack. He would continue to sample clips from film and other media throughout his career, using a quote from The Brain from Planet Arous in the Yuri's Revenge soundtrack Brainfreeze, for example. Klepacki next composed instrumental pieces for Command & Conquer, drawing influences from [...] orchestral, house, heavy metal, and hip hop music. For the credits, Klepacki wrote Airstrike, featuring a hook later used in [...] for the Global Defense Initiative. Conversely, the Brotherhood of Nod ending used the song Destructible Times written by Klepacki's local band, I AM. Developers requested the song because it [...] "reflected the war aspect and bad-ass vibe of Nod's side." [...] The C expansion pack The Covert Operations featured seven new ambient pieces, all of which were also included on the disc in high quality <b>CD</b> <b>Audio</b> format. Though the soundtrack was not released through retail, Westwood sold it by special order through its website and in game catalogues.|$|E
