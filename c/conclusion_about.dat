5|$|A 2000 UK {{systematic}} review (York) found that water fluoridation {{was associated with}} a decreased proportion of children with cavities of 15% and with a decrease in decayed, missing, and filled primary teeth (average decreases was 2.25teeth). The review found that the evidence was of moderate quality: few studies attempted to reduce observer bias, control for confounding factors, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis. Although no major differences between natural and artificial fluoridation were apparent, the evidence was inadequate for a <b>conclusion</b> <b>about</b> any differences.|$|E
5|$|The strike {{continued}} on August 2. About 250 TWU members initiated a back-to-work movement but were quickly forced {{to back down}} by the strike's leaders and supporters. At {{the end of the}} day, William H. Davis, head of the War Labor Board, wrote to President Roosevelt that the WLB had no jurisdiction over the situation and that it was up to the President to intervene. Representatives of the WMC and the FEPC had reached a similar <b>conclusion</b> <b>about</b> the need for the President's intervention the day before.|$|E
5|$|In August 1997, Carl Doyle and {{his wife}} Catherine Doyle were stabbed to death in Ballintubber, Co Roscommon by Mark Nash, a 25-year-old {{resident}} of Drumcondra in North Dublin. During his interview with the gardaí, he said that about three months prior to his arrest, as he was walking to Stoneybatter, he broke into a house through the back, and had stabbed two women in their sleep. In his statement, {{there were at least}} two aspects of the crime scene that were not known to the public at the time. Nash later retracted his confession. Nash's confession caused some consternation amongst the gardaí, as Dean Lyons had been charged at that point and was on remand awaiting trial. Two camps emerged within the gardaí, one which believed that Nash's confession threw doubt on Lyons' guilt, the other which believed that Lyons was the murderer. On 27 August 1997, the Garda Commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner James McHugh to carry out a review of the available evidence. He released a preliminary report on 10 September 1997, and an interim report on 9 January 1998; while these reports did not come to a <b>conclusion</b> <b>about</b> Lyons' guilt, they did raise a number of doubts about his testimony.|$|E
25|$|Individuals know a {{lot more}} about {{themselves}} than they do about others. Because information about others is less available, information about the self versus others leads people to make specific <b>conclusions</b> <b>about</b> their own risk, but results in them having a harder time making <b>conclusions</b> <b>about</b> the risks of others. This leads to differences in judgments and <b>conclusions</b> <b>about</b> self-risks compared to the risks of others, leading to larger gaps in the optimistic bias.|$|R

5|$|There are no {{recorded}} {{campaigns in}} Syro-Palestine during Amenhotep I's reign. However, {{according to the}} Tombos Stela of his successor, Thutmose I, when Thutmose led a campaign into Asia {{all the way to}} the Euphrates, he found no one who fought against him. If Thutmose did not lead a campaign which has not been recorded into Asia before this recorded one, it would mean that the preceding pharaoh would have had to pacify Syria instead, which would indicate a possible Asiatic campaign of Amenhotep I. Two references to the Levant potentially written during his reign might be contemporary witnesses to such a campaign. One of the candidates for Amenhotep's tomb contains a reference to Qedmi, which is somewhere in Canaan or the Transjordan, and Amenemhet's tomb contains a hostile reference to Mitanni. However, neither of these references necessarily refer to campaigning, nor do they even necessarily date to Amenhotep's reign. The location of Amenhotep's tomb is not certain, and Amenemhet lived to serve under multiple kings who are known to have attacked Mitanni. Records from Amenhotep's reign are simply altogether too scant and too vague to reach a <b>conclusion</b> <b>about</b> any Syrian campaign.|$|E

According to Dennett, ambiguities in the timings of the different events involved. Libet tells when the readiness potential occurs objectively, using electrodes, but relies on the subject reporting the position of the hand of a clock to determine when the conscious decision was made. As Dennett points out, this is only a report of where it seems to the subject that various things come together, not of the objective time at which they actually occur.|$|E
25|$|While the re-creating of the {{mechanised}} corps {{had been}} organised {{as proposed by}} Georgy Zhukov, this had not been completed when Nazi Germany attacked in 1941.

Voroshilov had been replaced by Marshal Timoshenko as Commissar in May 1940. Zhukov had drawn a different <b>conclusion</b> <b>about</b> armoured warfare from the success of the panzers in France and from his own experience in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol against Japan.|$|E

A full list of {{the aircraft}} the Red Baron was credited with shooting down was published as early as 1958—with documented RFC/RAF squadron details, aircraft serial numbers, and the identities of Allied airmen killed or captured—73 of the 80 listed match recorded British losses. A study conducted by British historian Norman Franks with two colleagues, published in Under the Guns of the Red Baron in 1998, reached the same <b>conclusion</b> <b>about</b> {{the high degree of}} accuracy of Richthofen's claimed victories.

25|$|The {{three studies}} that {{initially}} found that high-dose mannitol {{was effective in}} cases of severe head injury were {{the subject of an}} investigation published in 2007. Although several authors are listed with Dr. Julio Cruz, it is unclear whether the authors had knowledge of how the patients were recruited. Further, the Federal University of São Paulo, which Dr. Cruz gave as his affiliation, has never employed him. As a result of doubt surrounding Cruz's work, an updated version of the Cochrane review excludes all studies by Julio Cruz, leaving only 4 studies. Due to differences in selection of control groups, a <b>conclusion</b> <b>about</b> the clinical use of mannitol could not be reached.|$|E

Later the Institute for Criminal Expertise and the Department of Justice of the Russian Federation issued an official conclusion stating that the family photographs of Kosmodemyanskaya belong to the same person as the Pravda photograph of the hanged partisan.

25|$|This chronicle is {{his major}} legacy, {{providing}} contemporary detail on events in Wales, England and abroad and {{an insight into}} the life of an educated man moving through important spheres of influence at the time. He met Kings and Popes, chronicles the Peasants' Revolt (the chronicle opens with a description of Jack Straw) and Emperor Manuel II's Christmas visit to Richard II, lived in various cities and towns but was often on the move. Observant of phenomena from his youth, Adam is struck by the beauty of the Lake of Lucerne and the quality of Beaune wine, but draws a pessimistic <b>conclusion</b> <b>about</b> the night-time behaviour of Rome's canine population. He offered a useful interpretation of the history of his times. The chronicle throws particular light on the Glyndŵr revolt.

25|$|Light has an {{associated}} frequency, and this frequency {{may be used}} to drive the workings of a clock. The gravitational redshift leads to an important <b>conclusion</b> <b>about</b> time itself: Gravity makes time run slower. Suppose we build two identical clocks whose rates are controlled by some stable atomic transition. Place one clock on top of the tower, while the other clock remains on the ground. An experimenter on top of the tower observes that signals from the ground clock are lower in frequency than those of the clock next to her on the tower. Light going up the tower is a just a wave, and it is impossible for wave crests to disappear on the way up. Exactly as many oscillations of light arrive {{at the top of the}} tower as were emitted at the bottom. The experimenter concludes that the ground clock is running slow, and can confirm this by bringing the tower clock down to compare side-by-side with the ground clock. For a 1km tower, the discrepancy would amount to about 9.4nanoseconds per day, easily measurable with modern instrumentation.|$|E
