5|$|Erythromycin {{and other}} {{macrolides}} or clindamycin are recommended {{for people with}} severe penicillin allergies. First-generation <b>cephalosporins</b> {{may be used in}} those with less severe allergies and some evidence supports <b>cephalosporins</b> as superior to penicillin. Streptococcal infections may also lead to acute glomerulonephritis; however, the incidence of this side effect is not reduced by the use of antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Fungi are {{the sources}} of many types of {{medicinal}} drug including antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and statins. Major classes of antibiotics, the penicillins and the <b>cephalosporins,</b> are derived from substances produced by fungi. So also are the immunosuppressant macrolides, the cyclosporins.|$|E
5|$|Penicillin {{has been}} {{suggested}} as the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} S.iniae infection in mammals, including humans. In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to penicillin, several <b>cephalosporins,</b> clindamycin, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients were treated with parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all to be sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, and vancomycin.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of hydrolases, {{specifically}} those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cephalosporin-C acetylhydrolase. Other names in common use include <b>cephalosporin</b> C acetyl-hydrolase, <b>cephalosporin</b> C acetylase, <b>cephalosporin</b> acetylesterase, <b>cephalosporin</b> C acetylesterase, <b>cephalosporin</b> C acetyl-esterase, and <b>cephalosporin</b> C deacetylase. This enzyme participates in penicillin and <b>cephalosporin</b> biosynthesis.|$|R
40|$|The {{apparent}} {{stimulation of}} <b>cephalosporin</b> C biosynthesis by sodium thiosulfate {{is due to}} a nonbiological conversion of <b>cephalosporin</b> C to a new derivative, <b>cephalosporin</b> Cx. The new compound is more active than <b>cephalosporin</b> C against the assay organism, Escherichia coli W- 208. <b>Cephalosporin</b> Cx retains the properties of ultraviolet absorption and resistance to penicillinase, but migrates more slowly than <b>cephalosporin</b> C in the paper-chromatographic system used...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cephalosporin</b> C is an {{antibiotic}} of the <b>cephalosporin</b> class. It was isolated from fungi {{of the genus}} Acremonium and first characterized in 1961. Although not a very active antibiotic itself, synthetic analogs of <b>cephalosporin</b> C, such as cefalotin, became {{some of the first}} marketed <b>cephalosporin</b> antibiotic drugs.|$|R
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with <b>cephalosporins</b> show promise. Some evidence indicates intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. A long-term clinical trial of intravenous silibinin began in the US in 2010. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by liver cells, thereby protecting undamaged liver tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. According to one report based on a treatment of 60 patients with silibinin, patients who started the drug within 96 hours of ingesting the mushroom and who still had intact kidney function all survived. As of February 2014 supporting research has not yet been published.|$|E
5|$|Uncomplicated infections can be {{diagnosed}} and treated based on symptoms alone. Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin are typically first line. <b>Cephalosporins,</b> amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a fluoroquinolone {{may also be}} used. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing. The FDA recommends {{against the use of}} fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects. These medications substantially shorten the time to recovery with all being equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually sufficient, whereas nitrofurantoin requires 5–7days. Fosfomycin may be used as a single dose but has been associated with lower rates of efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, <b>cephalosporins,</b> and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} complex and {{synthetic}} media {{have been developed}} that are suitable {{for the production of}} <b>cephalosporin</b> C and <b>cephalosporin</b> N by a mutant strain of Cephalosporium (C. M. I. 49, 137). dl-Methionine increased the yield of both antibiotics, with more effect on <b>cephalosporin</b> N. l-Cystine had a greater enhancing effect on formation of <b>cephalosporin</b> C than on formation of <b>cephalosporin</b> N in synthetic media; serine increased yields of <b>cephalosporin</b> C under certain conditions. Disaccharides or polysaccharides appeared to be the best source for carbohydrates. No evidence was found for precursor action such as is found in penicillin fermentations. The ability of resting cells to produce antibiotic was demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Medically useful semisynthetic <b>cephalosporin</b> {{antibiotics}} {{are made}} from precursor 7 -aminocepha-losporanic acid (7 -ACA). <b>Cephalosporin</b> Acylase (CA), which catalyzes hydrolysis of both glutary l- 7 -aminocephalosporanic acid (GL- 7 ACA) and <b>cephalosporin</b> C (CPC) to 7 -ACA, is thus a very important enzyme for producing semisynthetic beta-lactam antibiotics. The <b>cephalosporin</b> acylase {{can be found in}} several Pseudomonas sp. (such as P. putida, P. cepacia BY 21 P. nitroreducens, P. syringae, p. SE 83, p. V 22, p. SY- 77, p. sp. 130, [...] .) and other bacteria. Therefore, screening of <b>cephalosporin</b> asylase positive pseudomonas is very important. We isolated 130 Pseudomonas sp. from clinical and environmental specimens (75 clinical samples, 40 hospital environment samples, 10 water samples, 5 soil samples). All of isolated Pseudomonas sp. were tested for <b>cephalosporin</b> acylase by P. C. R method and analysis of gel electrophoresis patterns. We found only 2 <b>cephalosporin</b> acylase pseudomonas positive from clinical samples. These strains were selected for sequencing and cloning in E. coli and assessment of gene expression and <b>cephalosporin</b> acylase production in others stages of our study...|$|R

25|$|<b>Cephalosporins</b> are {{indicated}} for the prophylaxis {{and treatment of}} infections caused by bacteria susceptible to this particular form of antibiotic. First-generation <b>cephalosporins</b> are active predominantly against Gram-positive bacteria, and successive generations have increased activity against Gram-negative bacteria (albeit often with reduced activity against Gram-positive organisms).|$|E
25|$|Fifth-generation <b>cephalosporins</b> are {{effective}} against MRSA, however.|$|E
25|$|Resistance to {{cephalosporin}} antibiotics {{can involve}} either reduced affinity of existing PBP components or {{the acquisition of}} a supplementary β-lactam-insensitive PBP. Currently, some Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Escherichia coli strains are resistant to <b>cephalosporins.</b> Some Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens strains have also developed resistance to <b>cephalosporins</b> to varying degrees.|$|E
40|$|Some {{biological}} {{properties of}} <b>cephalosporin</b> C {{and of a}} pyridinium derivative, “cephalosporin CA (pyridine),” were examined. Staphylococci, both penicillinase-producing and non-penicillinase-producing, and some other bacteria tested, were inhibited by 60 to 125 μg <b>cephalosporin</b> C/ml., and 5 to 20 μg <b>cephalosporin</b> CA (pyridine) /ml. The ratio of {{the activity of the}} two antibiotics varied for different organisms. Resistance developed slowly on repeated subculture of penicillinase-producing staphylococci in presence of either antibiotic. The minimum inhibitory concentration of <b>cephalosporin</b> CA (pyridine) upon penicillinase-producing staphylococci increased 4 to 8 -fold with a 500 -fold increase in inoculum size; with <b>cephalosporin</b> C there was a 2 -fold increase. Their activity was not reduced by serum. Both substances were non-toxic. They were excreted quantitatively in the urine when given intravenously or subcutaneously to mice. After oral administration less than 5 % of the dose was excreted. <b>Cephalosporin</b> CA (pyridine) was about 8 times more active than <b>cephalosporin</b> C in protecting mice from an experimental streptococcal infection, nine doses of 6. 25 mg/kg affording complete protection...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} desacetylcephalosporin C in <b>cephalosporin</b> C {{fermentation}} broths was investigated. Esterase activity was detected in cell-free extracts of Cephalosporium acremonium, but these extracts failed to deesterify <b>cephalosporin</b> C. When <b>cephalosporin</b> C {{was added to}} sterile and inoculated fermentation media, the antibiotic decayed at nearly identical rates. The formation of desacetylcephalosporin C during the fermentation was measured by quantitative chromatography and by the incorporation of valine- 1 - 14 C into the molecule. The rate constants obtained {{from the results of}} these experiments were equivalent to those for the decay of <b>cephalosporin</b> C in sterile and inoculated media. The data demonstrate that desacetylcephalosporin C is produced by nonenzymatic hydrolysis of <b>cephalosporin</b> C...|$|R

25|$|Clostridium difficile colitis {{may occur}} in {{connection}} with the use of any antibacterial drug, especially those with a broad spectrum of activity such as clindamycin, <b>cephalosporins,</b> and fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinoline treatment is associated with risk that is similar to or less than that associated with broad spectrum <b>cephalosporins.</b> Fluoroquinoline administration may be associated with the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent Clostridium strain.|$|E
25|$|C. difficile colitis is {{associated}} most strongly {{with the use}} of the following antibiotics: fluoroquinolones, <b>cephalosporins,</b> and clindamycin.|$|E

50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, {{specifically}} in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (7R)-7-(4-carboxybutanamido)cephalosporanate amidohydrolase. Other names in common use include 7beta-(4-carboxybutanamido)cephalosporanic acid acylase, <b>cephalosporin</b> C acylase, glutaryl-7-ACA acylase, CA, GCA, GA, <b>cephalosporin</b> acylase, glutaryl-7-aminocephalosporanic acid acylase, and GL-7-ACA acylase.

25|$|Together with cephamycins, they {{constitute}} a subgroup of β-lactam antibiotics called cephems. <b>Cephalosporins</b> {{were discovered in}} 1945 by the Italian pharmacologist Giuseppe Brotzu and were first sold in 1964.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotic {{treatment}} {{should cover}} both S.nbsp&pyogenes and S.nbsp&aureus. This may include {{a combination of}} <b>cephalosporins,</b> penicillins or vancomycin. The addition of clindamycin or gentamicin reduces toxin production and mortality.|$|E
25|$|Flucloxacillin is {{contraindicated}} {{in those}} with a previous history of allergy to penicillins, <b>cephalosporins,</b> or carbapenems.

50|$|In 1959 Abraham {{reported}} that his N-phenylacetyl derivative of <b>cephalosporin</b> C {{was much more}} potent against Staphylococcus aureus strains than the parent compound. This derivative was later named Cephaloram, a <b>cephalosporin</b> analogue of benzylpenicillin.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{cluster of}} early <b>cephalosporin</b> {{biosynthesis}} genes (pcbAB, pcbC, cefD 1, cefD 2 and cefT of Acremonium chrysogenum) contains all genes {{required for the}} biosynthesis of the <b>cephalosporin</b> biosynthetic pathway intermediate penicillin N. Downstream of the cefD 1 gene there is an unassigned open reading frame named cefM encoding a protein of the MFS family with 12 transmembrane spanning domains, different from the previously reported cefT. Targeted inactivation of cefM by gene replacement showed that {{it is essential for}} <b>cephalosporin</b> biosynthesis. The disrupted mutant accumulates a significant amount of penicillin N, is unable to synthesize deacetoxy-, deacetylcephalosporin C and <b>cephalosporin</b> C and shows impaired differentiation into arthrospores. Complementation of the disrupted mutant with the cefM gene restored the intracellular penicillin N concentration to normal levels and allowed synthesis and secretion of the <b>cephalosporin</b> intermediates and <b>cephalosporin</b> C. A fused cefM-gfp gene complemented the cefM-disrupted mutant and the CefM-GFP protein was targeted to intracellular microbodies that were abundant after 72 h of culture in the differentiating hyphae and in the arthrospore chains, coinciding with the phase of intense <b>cephalosporin</b> biosynthesis. Since the dual component enzyme system CefD 1 -CefD 2 that converts isopenicillin N to penicillin N contains peroxisomal targeting sequences, is probably that the epimerization step takes place in the peroxisome matrix. The CefM protein seems {{to be involved in the}} translocation of penicillin N from the peroxisome (or peroxisome-like microbodies) lumen to the cytosol where it is converted to <b>cephalosporin</b> C...|$|R
40|$|Six {{different}} industrial nitrogen {{sources were}} tested {{in order to obtain}} an increase of <b>cephalosporin</b> C titres by Cephalosporim acremonium in a complex medium.

25|$|Cefalexin, also spelled cephalexin, is an {{antibiotic}} that can treat {{a number of}} bacterial infections. It kills gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria by disrupting {{the growth of the}} bacterial cell wall. Cefalexin is a beta-lactam antibiotic within the class of first-generation <b>cephalosporins.</b> It works similarly to other agents within this class, including intravenous cefazolin, but can be taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|More {{severe cases}} require oral antibiotics, such as dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, or erythromycin. Alternatively, {{amoxicillin}} combined with clavulanate potassium, <b>cephalosporins</b> (first-generation) {{and many others}} may {{also be used as}} an antibiotic treatment. Alternatives for people who are seriously allergic to penicillin or infections with MRSA include doxycycline, clindamycin, and SMX-TMP.

When methionine was added at 72 h, the stimulation of <b>cephalosporin</b> biosynthesis was observed only 12 h later and required de novo protein synthesis. Methionine increased the levels of enzymes (isopenicillin N synthase and deacetylcephalosporin C acetyltransferase) expressed from genes (pcbC and cefG, respectively) located in the two clusters of <b>cephalosporin</b> biosynthesis genes in the wild-type A. chrysogenum strain and also in the two improved strains, CW 19 and C 10.
