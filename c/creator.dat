40|$|In recent years, YouTube {{has evolved}} from a {{platform}} of home videos and news media into a premiere platform for amateur content <b>creators</b> to create and distribute content. As YouTube continues to progress towards a media platform that promotes amateur <b>creators</b> and their content, the work and interactions of these <b>creators</b> becomes relevant as {{a study of the}} architects of digital labor. This thesis takes an ethnographical approach to examining <b>creators</b> within a certain subset of YouTube <b>creators</b> – video game Let’s Players – and analyzes their varying forms of interaction with three key points. First: the relationship and interaction between <b>creators</b> and their created content. Second: how LP content <b>creators</b> interact and work with other content <b>creators,</b> either within their own sphere or otherwise. And third: how <b>creators</b> interact and communicate with their audiences. This analysis and compilation of interview data is transferrable to other amateur content web platforms whose primary business model focuses on user-generated content...|$|R

5|$|Gasking {{asserted}} {{that the creation of}} the world is the most marvellous achievement imaginable. The merit of such an achievement is the product of its quality and the creator's disability: the greater the disability of the <b>creator,</b> the more impressive the achievement. Non-existence, Gasking asserts, would be the greatest handicap. Therefore, if the universe is the product of an existent <b>creator,</b> we could conceive of a greater being—one which does not exist. A non-existent <b>creator</b> is greater than one which exists, so God does not exist. Gasking's proposition that the greatest disability would be non-existence is a response to Anselm's assumption that existence is a predicate and perfection. Gasking uses this logic to assume that non-existence must be a disability.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Creator,</b> after {{creating}} Aquaria, {{created a}} series of civilizations, making a new one in turn when each one was destroyed. The <b>Creator</b> kidnaps Li, with whom Naija has fallen in love, and she attacks the <b>Creator</b> to get him back. The player defeats the god as the final boss of the game, and returns home with Li. In the epilogue, Naija is shown with Li and their child. If the player has found all of Naija's memories by discovering places she remembers, they reveal that the shadowy figure {{at the beginning of}} the game was her mother, Mia. Mia was made by the <b>Creator</b> and had the ability, like Naija, to use the different powers of all of the civilizations. She fled the <b>Creator,</b> and hid herself and Naija among several communities in succession; after the destruction of the last one she erased Naija's memory so that she would find out the history of Aquaria on her own and defeat the <b>Creator.</b> In the extended epilogue shown if the player has found all of the memories, Mia appears, telling Naija that the two of them can conquer the civilisations above the water. After Naija refuses, Mia kidnaps her, and vanishes; the extended epilogue ends with Lucien, Naija and Li's son, leaving to find her. If the player has not found all of the memories, the epilogue instead ends with Naija asking the player to find out about her past, and revealing that the narration of the game was intended to be heard by her son.|$|E

5|$|A myth {{about the}} Eye, known from allusions in the Coffin Texts from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC) {{and a more}} {{complete}} account in the Bremner-Rhind Papyrus from the Late Period (664–332 BC), demonstrates the Eye's close connection with Ra and Atum and her ability to act independently. The myth takes place before {{the creation of the}} world, when the solar creator—either Ra or Atum—is alone. Shu and Tefnut, the children of this <b>creator</b> god, have drifted away from him in the waters of Nu, the chaos that exists before creation in Egyptian belief, so he sends out his Eye to find them. The Eye returns with Shu and Tefnut but is infuriated to see that the <b>creator</b> has developed a new eye, which has taken her place. The <b>creator</b> god appeases her by giving her an exalted position on his forehead {{in the form of the}} uraeus, the emblematic cobra that appears frequently in Egyptian art, particularly on royal crowns. The equation of the Eye with the uraeus and the crown underlines the Eye's role as a companion to Ra and to the pharaoh, with whom Ra is linked. Upon the return of Shu and Tefnut, the <b>creator</b> god is said to have shed tears, although whether they are prompted by happiness at his children's return or distress at the Eye's anger is unclear. These tears give rise to the first humans. In a variant of the story, it is the Eye that weeps instead, so the Eye is the progenitor of humankind.|$|E

5|$|At {{the center}} of the massive ship, V'Ger is {{revealed}} to be Voyager 6, a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be learned, and return that information to its <b>creator.</b> The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission, and on its journey the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a focus other than its original mission; having learned what it could on its journey home, it finds its existence empty and without purpose. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the <b>Creator</b> come in person to finish the sequence. Realizing that the machine wants to merge with its <b>creator,</b> Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating a new form of life that disappears into another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs Enterprise out to space for future missions.|$|E

Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural <b>creator</b> almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion.

But reaching a fund-raising goal or making a project successful is always a challenge. Besides, {{little is known about}} post-campaign activities of project <b>creators</b> and backers. To fill the gap, in this research, we are interested in understanding (i) the characteristics of successful projects, (ii) how project <b>creators</b> reacted when their projects failed, and (iii) what post-campaign activities <b>creators</b> and backers made. To achieve our research objectives, first, we analyzed successful projects and failed projects on Kickstarter, the most popular crowdfunding platform. Then we clustered successful projects by their evolutionary patterns in terms of pledged money toward understanding what efforts project <b>creators</b> should make {{in order to make a}} project successful and get more pledged money.

40|$|Copyright markets, it is said, are ‘winner takes all’ markets favouring the {{interests}} of corporate investors over {{the interests}} of primary <b>creators.</b> However, {{little is known about}} popular music creators’ ‘lived experience’ of copyright. This thesis interrogates key aspects of copyright transactions between <b>creators</b> and investors operating in the UK music industries using analysis of various copyright related documents and semi-structured interviews with <b>creators</b> and investors. The research found considerable variety in the types of ‘deal’ <b>creators</b> enter into and considerable divergence in the potential rewards. It was observed that new-entrant <b>creators</b> have little comprehension of the basic tenets of copyright, but with experience they become more ‘copyright aware’. Documentary and interview evidence reveals <b>creators</b> routinely assign copyright to third party investors for the full term of copyright in sound recordings: the justification for this is questionable. An almost inevitable consequence of this asymmetry of understanding of copyright and asymmetry of bargaining power is that <b>creators</b> become alienated from their copyright works. The empirical evidence presented here supports historic and contemporary calls for a statutory mechanism limiting the maximum copyright assignment period to ten-years...|$|R
