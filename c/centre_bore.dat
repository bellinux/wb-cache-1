40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is the use of}} pinhole collimation in Nuclear Medicine. A pinhole is a single aperture in an opaque material that is placed between the detector and source of interest, and photons must pass through the hole to reach the detector. The choices of pinhole parameters, e. g. the pinhole material and size of the opening, are closely linked to the performance of the detector system. Pinhole-based single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has primarily been used to investigate human diseases in small animals because of the superior resolution and efficiency achieved with this type of collimation. The SPECT methodology involves determination of the radiopharmaceutical distribution within an object. An essential step in this methodology is the image reconstruction, i. e., the transformation of the acquired two-dimensional (2 D) data into a three-dimensional (3 D) distribution. This dissertation describes the development of a SPECT system for small animal imaging called InSPECT. In Paper I, determination of the reconstructed resolution for a prototype setup with a video-based detector system is discussed, and in Paper II, construction of the InSPECT system with eight separate video detectors is described. A fusible metal, Rose’s metal, was used to cast the <b>centre</b> <b>bore,</b> in which platinum pinholes were mounted. The cast pieces could adequately shield the detectors and could be machined with a high precision. Thus, Rose’s metal, which is relatively inexpensive, could be employed for pinhole collimation but would lead to image characteristics that are less favourable than those achievable using gold or platinum pinholes. In Paper III, we present an evaluation of the performance of Rose’s metal pinholes and a comparison with other pinhole materials. Monte Carlo-based computer models can be utilised to simulate the image formation process and can enable expensive and time-consuming instrumentation changes to be evaluated prior to building prototypes. In Paper IV, we discuss the implementation of a cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) semiconductor detector model in the Monte Carlo program SIMIND. The accuracy of the model was confirmed by comparing its results to measurements. In Paper V, we address the use of the CZT model in an SIMIND-based maximum-likelihood–expectation-maximisation iterative reconstruction of the measured data. The images reconstructed using the computer model enabled the quantification of the total activity without requiring calibration of the detector count per unit second per unit activity. In Paper VI, we describe the simulation of a dedicated SPECT scanner that employs 19 semiconductor detector–pinhole units for myocardial perfusion imaging. Compared to conventional SPECT devices, this camera is more efficient, and the efficiency is often traded for a reduction in imaging times and patient doses. An alternative use of the efficiency is to use smaller pinhole which yields better spatial resolution in the projections. No increase in contrast-to-noise was seen for smaller pinholes since any increase in contrast was also accompanied by an equal increase in noise. Also, changes in transmurality affected the CNR {{to a greater extent than}} did changes in lesion extent...|$|E
40|$|Analizirajući nedavno pronađeni kamin s grbom obitelji Grisogono u Splitu i uspoređujući ga s ulomcima kamina iz trogirske Velike palače Ćipiko, autor oba kamina pripisuje djelovanju Nikole Firentinca u Trogiru (1468. - 70.) i Splitu (1470. - 74.). U trilobnim kamenim elementima s grbom Ćipika u akantusu prepoznaje dijelove kamina prve faze obnove palače iz polovice 15. stoljeća. Arhitektonsku plastiku s palače Grisogono na Peristilu vezuje za Firentinčevu splitsku radionicu. Stone {{fragments}} of a Renaissance fireplace, built as spolia {{into the kitchen}} hearth, {{have been found in}} the attic of a house in Kružićeva Street in Split. Judging from the coat of arms, the fireplace must have belonged to one of the palaces of the Split Grisogono family. All that is left undamaged of it is the architrave decorated with moulding and dentils, divided in the facing part with shallow stone frames into three fields. In the central field relief angel shield bearers support a shield on which is a rampant lion with sword, the coat of arms of the Grisogono family, and in the centre of the other two fields are bas reliefs with the heads of winged angels. Brackets from a Renaissance fireplace were built into the same hearth, holding the architrave, decorated with lion’s head and floral decorations at the side. They belonged to the same unit, of very high quality carving, made in the workshop of a skilled craftsman in the mid- 15 th century. In the Large Cipiko Palace in Trogir, during the time of conservation treatment, {{fragments of}} an architrave of similar fireplace were found, incorporated at a later date into the kitchen hearth {{at the time of the}} Baroque rebuilding of the palace. The Trogir fragments want their brackets, which were probably very similar to those of the Grisogono hearth. The two architraves are very similar. They are of similar dimensions, and the facing part of each is panelled in a similar way with the same shallow stone frames with characteristic slanting that gives a perspective impression of a third dimension. In the centre of the second architrave there was the Cipiko coat of arms with wings that are modelled in the same way as the wings of the angel on the Split fireplace. The two fireplaces must have been produced in the same workshop. The brackets of the Split fireplace with the leonine heads, the putti, with their rounded stomachs, stepping out, holding the shield, the heads of winged angels are motifs that in the same order grace the tomb of Ivan and Šimun Sobota, put up in 1469 in the church of the Trogir Dominicans. The manner of handling the depiction of the lion’s jaws, eyes, mane, ears and forehead on the Sobota tomb are repeated on the brackets of the fireplace with the only difference in the scale. The hands of the angels with their spread little finger, their little heads and hairstyles show that the sculptor of both fireplaces and the builder of the Sobota tomb was Niccolò di Giovanni the Florentine. The Trogir oeuvre of the Florentine is better known than that of Split. Niccolò worked on the Cipiko palaces from his coming to Trogir in 1468 to 1470, when Koriolan Cipiko, commander of a trireme from Trogir, left town to go to war. Built as spolia into the parapet of the staircase of the Cipiko palace, two stone fragments attracted attention with their working and decorations. The uncommon form, the curvature of the surface and the ornamentation with curved foliage and figures of winged putti, two of which are holding the Cipiko coat of arms, started up many questions. The fragments once belonged to a unique symmetrical composition wanting the left hand part, completely harmonious with the right hand part, with a motif of children’s heads peering out among curving acanthus leaves. These two lateral elements were with one end attached to the wall, and like the brackets bent towards the <b>centre</b> <b>bore</b> the central piece with the Cipiko coat of arms that was set into the dentil and onto the slope like a keystone of a straight arch. The whole construction was like a beam, in plan bent into the form of a shallow trilobe, built at its ends into the surface of the wall. It belonged to an exceptionally luxurious fireplace of the mid- 15 th century, the hood of which must have been equally richly decorated with frescos or carvings as with the described Dubrovnik fireplaces of the early quattrocento studied in the archival documents by Cvito Fisković. The hood of the Cipiko fireplace was in the form of the cowling of a trilobe-based cone, which can be seen from the traces of the iron brackets with which it was attached to the beam. Together with Andrija Aleši, Niccolò worked in Split, which is recorded only in one document, of November 30, 1472, when they were paid ninety ducats for works on the pillars of the bell tower of Split cathedral. At the end of the 1970 s the Renaissance floor of the Cipci Palace on the Split Peristyle was renovated, Cvito Fisković ascribing it to the workshop of Niccolò di Giovanni. This was a big step forward in the definition of the Florentine’s Split oeuvre, which had earlier hardly been mentioned at all. The finding of a fireplace with the coat of arms of the Split Grisogono family shows that Niccolò had also worked on other palaces of the Split patricians. The fireplace was moved to Kružićeva Street from the Grisogono Palace at the corner of the Palace and the city Decumanus, the western part of which was knocked down and built from the ground up in the 19 th century. This is shown by one of the windows of this building that after the demolition was moved to the façade of the house in Kružićeva at the same time as the fireplace was brought into it. Of the work of Niccolò on the Grisogono Palace, only the portal in the ground floor of the eastern, earlier wing, which was not demolished, remained. This earlier portal was remodelled in the 15 th century by the insertion of capitals and a Gothic wand on the jamb decorated with laurel leaves carved in bas relief, with a motif that Niccolò often used, as can be seen, for example, on the northern door of the Church of St Peter in Trogir. Capitals with motifs characteristic of the Florentine’s oeuvre exist in the palaces of the Split Humanists. The Grisogono fireplace, in which the hand of Niccolò di Giovanni can be identified, is a new addition to the known oeuvre of this master in Split, and additionally backs up the earlier proposition that he had a workshop in Split. In the Split Peristyle in addition to the cathedral bell tower and the Cipci Palace, thus another building has been identified in which we find Niccolò di Giovanni present at the beginning of the 1570 s, the Grisogono Palace...|$|E

40|$|Branding' is {{well known}} for {{consumer}} products but power has shifted from manufacturers' brands towards retailers'. The term 'image' is more common than 'brand' in the context of shopping centres, but 'branding' may become more important. In this study, the authors first investigated qualitatively, asking shoppers to describe centres in 'personality' terms and eliciting clear descriptive differences between centres. For example, one in-town <b>centre</b> was 'dull, <b>boring</b> and old-fashioned... not exciting, just OK'; a larger regional centre was 'trendy, prestigious... strong, vibrant, big and colourful'. Second, the authors evaluated six UK shopping centres quantitatively using a questionnaire survey (n = 287). The 'strong and vibrant' centre scored significantly higher than the 'dull and boring' one. Despite 'branding' being little used by shopping centres, those with the better 'brand images' tended to have larger catchment areas, sales and rental incomes. The authors contend that brand management could pay rewards in terms of customer numbers, sales turnover and rental income...|$|R
6000|$|This Mwres--the civility of [...] "Mr." [...] had {{vanished}} ages ago--was {{one of the}} officials under the Wind Vane and Waterfall Trust, the great company that owned every wind wheel and waterfall in the world, and which pumped all the water and supplied all the electric energy that people in these latter days required. He lived in a vast hotel near that part of London called Seventh Way, and had very large and comfortable apartments on the seventeenth floor. Households and family life had long since disappeared with the progressive refinement of manners; and indeed the steady rise in rents and land values, the disappearance of domestic servants, the elaboration of cookery, had rendered the separate domicile of Victorian times impossible, even had any one desired such a savage seclusion.

On some of these chairs were seated gaily-dressed men and women.

5000|$|The [...] "diabolo" [...] (or [...] "wasp waist pellet") is {{the most}} common design found today. It can have a flat, round, hollow or pointed tip, {{followed}} by a taper to a thin waist. From the waist back, the pellet is hollow, and flares out to full diameter when pressurized by the gun. The head, or solid part in front of the waist, is usually sized to fit the bore just touching the rifling. This keeps the pellet <b>centred</b> in the <b>bore,</b> while keeping the friction as low as possible. The effect of friction is used {{in order to keep the}} pellet stationary until the piston has reached the end of its travel, compressing as much air as is possible. The skirt of the pellet is thin, and made of a malleable material, usually lead or lead alloy, although non-toxic alternatives are available that use tin or even plastic. When shot, the skirt will obturate to fit the bore and provide a good seal, and engage the rifling, whereby imparting spin. In a smoothbore barrel, the skirt will still flare to provide a tight seal, but since there is no rifling, the pellet will not spin, and is less accurate. In most cases of this type, the solid head in the front and hollow skirt in back will work to prevent the pellet from tumbling. However, this is not always the case, and some ammo types of this nature will tumble in flight, and hit the target sideways. When this happens the pellet will not leave a clean, round hole in the paper, but will instead, leave behind a keyhole-shaped silhouette. This phenomenon is known as keyholing.|$|R
