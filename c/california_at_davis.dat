During the Independent Activities Period in 1973, {{a group of}} students including Klein worked together under Professor Buckley to produce an aluminum framed bicycle. After analyzing a number of contemporary steel frames, and examining ones that had broken in use, they were able to determine the stresses placed on a bicycle frame. Faced with limited available types of aluminum alloy tubing, the students chose to construct frames from 6061 aluminium alloy seamless drawn tube; alternatives such as the stronger 7075 aluminum alloy were discarded because of the tubing dimensions.|$|E

25|$|Historically, lensing {{analyses}} were conducted on galaxy clusters detected via their baryon content (e.g. from optical or X-ray surveys). The sample of galaxy clusters studied with lensing was thus subject to various selection effects; for example, only the most luminous clusters were investigated. In 2006, David Wittman of the University of <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Davis</b> and collaborators published the first sample of galaxy clusters detected via their lensing signals, completely independent of their baryon content. Clusters discovered through lensing are subject to mass selection effects because the more massive clusters produce lensing signals with higher signal-to-noise.|$|E
25|$|Pinot noir can be {{particularly}} prone to mutation (suggesting it has active transposable elements), and thanks to its long history in cultivation {{there are hundreds of}} different clones in vineyards and vine collections worldwide.

The French Etablissement National Technique pour l'Amelioration de la Viticulture (ENTAV) has set up a program to select the best clones of Pinot.

40|$|Eggs {{and small}} to {{medium-sized}} larvae of beet armyworm are exploited by {{a complex of}} natural enemies in hay alfalfa fields in northern <b>California.</b> Field studies <b>at</b> <b>Davis</b> (Yolo Co.) during 2004 revealed that predation on sentinel egg masses ranged from 50 - 90 %. The egg-predators included minute pirate bug, damsel bug, lygus bugs, big-eyed bugs, green-lacewing larvae, soft-winged flower beetle and convergent ladybird beetle. Three parasites were reared from larvae <b>at</b> <b>Davis</b> from 1999 - 2004; total parasitization ranged from 25 - 60 %. A few larvae were infected with a nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV); however, no epizootic occurred from 1999 - 2004. These results suggest that natural enemies, primarily generalist predators, are largely responsible for maintaining beet-armyworm populations at relatively low levels in non-treated alfalfa fields in the region...|$|R

2500|$|A decision-theoretic {{derivation}} of the Born rule from Everettarian assumptions, {{was produced}} by David Deutsch (1999) and refined by Wallace (2002â€“2009) and Saunders (2004). Deutsch's derivation is a two-stage proof: first he shows {{that the number of}} orthonormal Everett-worlds after a branching is proportional to the conventional probability density. Then he uses game theory to show that these are all equally likely to be observed. The last step in particular has been criticised for circularity. Some other reviews have been positive, although the status of these arguments remains highly controversial; some theoretical physicists have taken them as supporting the case for parallel universes. In the New Scientist article, reviewing their presentation at a September 2007 conference, Andy Albrecht, a physicist at the University of <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Davis,</b> is quoted as saying [...] "This work will go down {{as one of the most}} important developments in the history of science." ...|$|E

50|$|Testing in {{laboratory}} conditions by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1992-1993 revealed that this cultivar has a resistance to Dutch elm disease, although the original Princeton Elm, which grew in Princeton Cemetery and {{was estimated to}} be over 150 years old, was felled in April 2005 after suffering 60% dieback, attributed by some accounts to Dutch Elm Disease. Moreover, trees introduced to the UK, where the larger bark beetle Scolytus scolytus is the principal vector, were found to be susceptible, and many died, as did all 20 sent to Eisele, Darmstadt, for testing by inoculation with the pathogen. Princeton Elms planted in North America are highly prone to leaf damage by Japanese beetles Popillia japonica. Trees grown in the UK have also proven very susceptible to damage by leaf-feeding insects, far more so than native or Asiatic elms. Henry noted that such damage was common to all American Elm Ulmus americana grown in the UK.
