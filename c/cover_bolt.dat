5000|$|For the 2007+ GMT900 Silverado/Sierra trucks, the LU3 engine {{received}} a {{distributorless ignition system}} - the traditional distributor was eliminated where a stub shaft was used. Also the crankshaft sensor was upgraded to a 58x reluctor wheel (same as the GEN IV LSx) {{which resulted in the}} timing cover redesigned (this time the cover is aluminum alloy in lieu of the composite cover; the timing <b>cover</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern {{is not the same as}} the 1996-06 LU3 and L35.|$|E
5000|$|The Windsor and Romeo have subtle differences. Valve <b>cover</b> <b>bolt</b> {{patterns}} are one. Romeo has fewer bolts than the Windsor. Another {{difference is the}} front cover bolts. The Windsor uses 8 mm and the Romeo uses 10 mm bolts. The Romeo uses jack screws on the main caps and the Windsor uses dowels. The new engine produced [...] at 4400 rpm and [...] of torque at 3500 rpm, matching the output of its predecessor. For 1998, the 4.6 L V8 received a small increase in output, resulting in [...] at 4750 rpm and [...] of torque at 3500 rpm. This was achieved through PCM calibration and a modified fuel system. Though capable of matching or exceeding the older 302 V8's output, the 4.6 L V8 was criticized for delivering inadequate performance, particularly against the larger displacement of the OHV V8 used in the Mustang's chief rival, the Chevrolet Camaro.|$|E

J. Haley's tire went down and {{defeated}} William Byron on the green-white-checker finish to win. The win made Gilliland the youngest race winner in track history. In postrace inspection, Gilliland's car {{was found to have}} the lubrication oil reservoir tank <b>cover</b> <b>bolted</b> improperly. As a result, his team received a P5 penalty (the second-worst in NASCAR) and was docked thirty points, although Gilliland was allowed to keep the victory.

The Khrunichev-built first stage reportedly performed nominally, and the second stage separation took place as expected, but the payload fairing separation system malfunctioned {{and half of the}} satellite protective <b>cover</b> stayed <b>bolted</b> to the second stage.

5000|$|... 1958 - Bosses {{for side}} motor mounts {{were added to}} the block casting, {{utilized}} for production mounts for this and all future model years. However, the features for front motor mounts as used in 1955-1957 remained part of the block casting in this and future years. The 265-cubic-inch version of the engine was discontinued. Also, the cylinder head valve <b>cover</b> mounting <b>bolt</b> holes were changed from the top row staggered (relative to the bottom row of bolts) to the [...] "straight-across" [...] pattern that remained the way of identifying the early heads from the newer ones with a valve cover design which lasted until the 1987 center-bolt-style covers.|$|R
2500|$|The {{underside}} of the door handles were slightly recontoured to minimize slipping fingers when the handles are pulled. Seat belt release buttons were moved {{from the face of}} the buckle to the end for improved convenience. An electronic compass was added to the inside rear-view mirror. Larger front brakes came along with cast aluminum front control arms and steering knuckles. The rear ashtray assembly was changed from a click-lock face to a pull-up face. Finally, the spare tire cover and jack cradle assembly was changed from the jack and <b>cover</b> being <b>bolted</b> down to one where the jack sat in a plastic [...] "bucket" [...] inside the spare with the cover simply placed on top.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] {{engine was}} {{developed}} by AMC in just 26 months using many off the shelf components while featuring, among others, additional strength, improved combustion chamber, port setup, and cam profile. The total weight of the new engine was , only one pound more than the 258 six despite its heavier components and parts. For example, the cast aluminum valve <b>cover</b> featured 15 <b>bolts,</b> the industry's most, to achieve a positive seal.|$|R
50|$|To {{gain the}} {{superior}} hitting {{power of the}} larger 7.7mm cartridge, several caliber 6.5mm Type 38 rifles were modified for the new round. Although the tests proved satisfactory, the army decided that the added recoil and larger chambering for the 7.7mm cartridge, would require an entirely new rifle for the cartridge. It utilized a cock-on-closing action and an unusual safety mechanism, operated by pressing in the large knurled disk {{at the rear of}} the bolt with the palm of the hand and rotating it in a 1/8 clockwise turn, which is often misunderstood by Western shooters who are used to the Mauser's thumb lever safety. It featured a quick-release bolt and antiaircraft sights, as well as a sliding <b>bolt</b> <b>cover</b> and monopod. The <b>bolt</b> <b>cover,</b> in particular, was highly problematic. Many soldiers simply discarded them due to excessive rattling. As a bolt-action rifle, the Type 99 was a very solid weapon, but as with all manually operated rifles used during World War II, they were in most close combat situations outclassed by semi-automatic rifles and submachine guns.|$|R
50|$|The rifle shared many {{features}} {{with the}} Arisaka rifle, {{such as a}} two-part stock, a ovoid bolt handle, and double-gas escape ports on the receiver. It also had a sliding <b>bolt</b> <b>cover</b> that attached to the bolt, and was removable. Another similarity it had with the Arisaka was the bolt being bored from the rear, {{in order to allow}} room for a mainspring, which was fixed in by the use of a large housing.|$|R

50|$|To {{mount the}} optics, a side-rail is {{permanently}} {{attached to the}} left wall of the receiver which accepts an alloy sliding dovetail rail mount with a clamping lever to which can be attached various telescopic sights and night optics. The mount is detachable from the receiver rail in seconds by swinging the locking lever open and sliding the scope and mount off the rail to the rear. It can be removed and reattached without loss of zero. The optic sight is normally removed during field stripping to give {{easy access to the}} receiver <b>cover</b> and <b>bolt</b> carrier. The rifle features mechanically adjustable backup AKM-type iron sights with a sliding tangent rear sight which can be adjusted from 100 m to 1,000 m. These sights can be used with or without the optic sight in place.|$|R
