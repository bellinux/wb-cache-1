5|$|There is much {{interest}} in the coordination <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> neptunium, because its five oxidation states all exhibit their own distinctive chemical behavior, and the coordination <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> the actinides is heavily influenced by the actinide contraction (the greater-than-expected decrease in ionic radii across the actinide series, analogous to the lanthanide contraction).|$|E

5|$|Fischer and {{co-workers}} also studied the <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> iridocene, the third transition series analogue of rhodocene and cobaltocene, finding the <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> rhodocene and iridocene are generally similar. The synthesis of numerous iridocenium salts including the tribromide and hexafluorophosphate have been described. Just as with rhodocene, iridocene dimerises {{at room temperature}} but a monomer form can be detected at low temperatures and in gas phase and IR, NMR, and ESR measurements indicate a chemical equilibrium is present and confirm the sandwich structure of the iridocene monomer. The complex , the analogue of rhodocene derivative reported by Fischer, has also been studied and demonstrates properties consistent with {{a greater degree of}} π-backbonding in iridium(I) systems than is found in the analogous cobalt(I) or rhodium(I) cases.|$|E

5|$|The <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> {{mendelevium}} {{is mostly}} known only in solution, {{in which it}} can take on the +3 or +2 oxidation states. The +1 state has also been reported, but {{has not yet been}} confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> stable carbenes has {{not been}} fully explored. However, Enders et al. have {{performed}} a range of organic reactions involving a triazol-5-ylidene. These reactions are outlined below and may {{be considered as a}} model for other carbenes.|$|E
5|$|This {{similarity}} {{results in}} nearly identical chemical behavior {{and in the}} formation of similar chemical compounds. The <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> hafnium is so similar to that of zirconium that a separation on chemical reactions was not possible; only the physical properties of the compounds differ. The melting points and boiling points of the compounds and the solubility in solvents are the major differences in the <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> these twin elements. Titanium is considerably different from the other two owing to the effects of the lanthanide contraction.|$|E

5|$|Zinc {{chemistry}} {{is similar to}} the <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> the late first-row transition metals, nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless. The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure, and in other circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor, the <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> zinc has much in common with that of magnesium. In other respects, there is little similarity with the late first-row transition metals. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known.|$|E
5|$|After Neil Bartlett's {{discovery}} in 1962 that xenon can form chemical compounds, {{a large number}} of xenon compounds have been discovered and described. Almost all known xenon compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine or oxygen. The <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> xenon in each oxidation state is analogous to that of the neighboring element iodine in the immediately lower oxidation state.|$|E
5|$|Among other achievements, Bachelder {{developed}} {{methods for}} the purification {{of the rare}} elements tellurium and indium. Other aspects of her broad scientific expertise found application {{in the field of}} marine archaeology, when she determined the chemical composition of brass cannons found in the Aegean Sea on sunken ships. She also made contributions to astrochemistry, when NASA asked her to analyze the <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> Moon rocks which had been collected from the Moon's surface during the Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972.|$|E
