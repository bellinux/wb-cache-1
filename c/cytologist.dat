5|$|Stebbins started {{graduate}} studies at Harvard in 1928, initially working on flowering plant taxonomy and biogeography—particularly {{that of the}} flora of New England—with Merritt Lyndon Fernald. He completed his MA in 1929 and continued to work toward his Ph.D. He became interested in using chromosomes for taxonomic studies, a method that Fernald did not support. Stebbins chose to concentrate his doctoral work on the cytology of plant reproductive processes in the genus Antennaria, with <b>cytologist</b> E. C. Jeffrey as his supervisor and Fernald on his supervisory panel. During his Ph.D. candidature, Stebbins sought advice and supervision from geneticist Karl Sax. Sax identified several errors in Stebbins's work and disapproved of his interpretation of results that, while in accordance with Jeffrey's views, were inconsistent {{with the work of}} contemporary geneticists. Jeffrey and Sax argued over Stebbins's dissertation, and the thesis was revised numerous times to accommodate their differing views.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{interobserver}} reproducibility of {{the diagnosis of}} 'adequacy' of cervical smears according to the Bethesda System criteria in cervical smears. Study design: 358 cervical smears were obtained from three Italian cytopathological centres in 1998 - 99. All centres provided consecutively collected smears. The cervical smears were independently and blindly assessed by four <b>cytologists.</b> The screening was performed using a 10 x objective and an additional evaluation {{of the percentage of}} cellularity was performed using a 4 x objective. Results: The proportion of smears assessed by the four <b>cytologists</b> as 'adequate' ranged from 60 % to 70 %, the proportion of 'satisfactory for evaluation but limited by' ranged from 27 % to 38 %, and the proportion of 'inadequate smears' ranged from 2 % to 4 %. Full agreement in the assessment of smear adequacy was observed in 311 slides and disagreement was observed only in 47. The category 'inadequate smear' was less reliable than the other two; however, the kappa value observed was acceptable. Conclusion: The present study shows {{that it is possible to}} achieve a high reproducibility in the assessment of smear adequacy, at least among expert <b>cytologists</b> who follow the Bethesda System criteria strictly...|$|R

60|$|Presently, in {{accordance}} with his wish, people came to talk to him, and he could forget himself again. Rachel Borken sat {{for a long time}} with him and talked chiefly of women in the world, and with her was a girl named Edith Haydon who was already very well known as a <b>cytologist.</b> And several of the younger men who were working in the place and a patient named Kahn, a poet, and Edwards, a designer of plays and shows, spent some time with him. The talk wandered from point to point and came back upon itself, and became now earnest and now trivial as the chance suggestions determined. But soon afterwards Gardener wrote down notes of things he remembered, and it is possible to put together again the outlook of Karenin upon the world and how he thought and felt about many of the principal things in life.|$|E
60|$|The Poietic or {{creative}} {{class of}} mental individuality embraces {{a wide range}} of types, but they agree in possessing imaginations that range beyond the known and accepted, and that involve the desire to bring the discoveries made in such excursions, into knowledge and recognition. The scope and direction of the imaginative excursion may vary very greatly. It may be the invention of something new or the discovery of something hitherto unperceived. When the invention or discovery is primarily beauty then we have the artistic type of Poietic mind; when it is not so, we have the true scientific man. The range of discovery may be narrowed {{as it is in the}} art of Whistler or the science of a <b>cytologist,</b> or it may embrace a wide extent of relevance, until at last both artist or scientific inquirer merge in the universal reference of the true philosopher. To the accumulated activities of the Poietic type, reacted upon by circumstances, are due almost all the forms assumed by human thought and feeling. All religious ideas, all ideas of what is good or beautiful, entered life through the poietic inspirations of man. Except for processes of decay, the forms of the human future must come also through men of this same type, and it is a primary essential to our modern idea of an abundant secular progress that these activities should be unhampered and stimulated.|$|E

40|$|Objective Listening {{to music}} and other {{auditory}} material during microscopy work is common practice among <b>cytologists.</b> While many <b>cytologists</b> would claim several benefits of such activity, research in other fields suggests that it might adversely affect diagnostic performance. Using a cross-modal distraction paradigm, {{the aim of the}} present study was to investigate the effect of auditory stimulation on the visual interpretation of cell images. Methods Following initial training, 34 participants undertook cell interpretation tests under four auditory conditions (liked music, disliked music, speech and silence) in a counterbalanced repeated-measures study. Error rate, area under the ROC curve, criterion and response time were measured for each condition. Results There was no significant effect of auditory stimulation on the accuracy or speed with which cell images were interpreted, mirroring the results of a previous visual distraction study. Conclusions To the extent that the experiment reflects clinical practice, listening to music or other forms of auditory material whilst undertaking microscopy duties is an unlikely source of distraction in the cytopathology reading room. From a cognitive perspective the results are consistent with the notion that high focal-task engagement may have blocked any attentional capture the sound may otherwise have produced...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the process of}} object detection, recognition and classification in digital optical images of human breast cells {{with the aim of}} differentiating between normal and abnormal (cancerous) cells. The work is based on research into the development of a breast cancer screening system that can be used by <b>cytologists</b> to differentiate between benign and malignant types using images that are typical of those currently interpreted by <b>cytologists</b> world-wide. The approach considered is based on feature vectors which are of two types. We consider statistical features such as the mode, median, mean, and standard deviation and features composed of Euclidian geometric parameters such as the object perimeter, area and infill coefficient. All components of the feature vectors are computed to reflect the statistical characteristics and the geometric structure of the imaged cells. The recognition process includes a segmentation algorithm based on an adaptive imaging threshold procedure that is sensitive to local ranges in pixel intensity (minimum-maximum values). Decision criteria are based on the application of Fuzzy Logic and Membership Function theory. In particular, we present a technique for the creation and extraction of data to construct the Membership Function...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} highlights {{strengths and}} weaknesses of cervical cytology screening in Croatia, with particular reference to the opportunistic screening, the use of conventional Papanicolaou (Pap) test and the analysis of some organizational, educational and performance issues that are associated with it. Its aim is to propose measures to improve the efficacy of cervical cytology screening in order to reduce cervical cancer mortality. Currently, in excess of 450, 000 Pap tests/ year are examined at 35 laboratories scattered throughout the country. All of these laboratories use standard operating procedures including internal and external quality control. They employ a total of 68 <b>cytologists</b> and 91 cytotechnologists. The sensitivity of cervical screening in Croatia is 90. 0 %, specificity 98. 6 %, positive predictive value 92. 3 %, negative predictive value 98. 1 % and overall diagnostic accuracy 97. 2 %. The high diagnostic accuracy of cervical cytology is attributed to the long-standing tradition of education and training of <b>cytologists</b> (postgraduate MSc course since 1967, independent residency since 1974) and cytotechnologists (since 1968). This tradition spanning {{more than half a century}} means that today in Croatia there is a developed network of cytology laboratories staffed by highly competent <b>cytologists</b> and trained cytotechnologists. The high accuracy of cancer detection through Pap tests provides strong evidence in support of cervical cytology screening remaining the basic method of prevention for cervical carcinoma. However, some modifications to the current situation are needed. These relate primarily to opportunistic screening. The current screening coverage rate is 68 %, although there is capacity, which would allow for all women at risk, i. e. those aged 25 – 64, to be screened once in three years. The screening coverage relates mainly to those women visiting gynecological out patient clinics for unrelated conditions. A properly organized and controlled national screening programme should replace this. This should be accompanied by the introduction of alternative, highly sensitive methods of sample collection and preparation, such as are available through the introduction of new technologies, e. g. liquid based cytology...|$|R
