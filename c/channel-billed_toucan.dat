They usually sing between segments, and when they sing together, near the end, {{it is time to}} sleep.

40|$|The <b>Channel-billed</b> <b>Toucan</b> (Ramphastos vitellinus) is a frugivorous {{bird that}} {{eventually}} predates small vertebrates. This note reports a predatory event of one <b>Channel-billed</b> <b>Toucan</b> upon a black rat (Rattus rattus). The bird captured the rat {{on the ground}} with its beak, then, it returned to the canopy where it killed the rat beating it against a tree branch. After the rats death, the toucan ingested muscular and visceral tissues. Although the predation upon small vertebrates has been described for this species, the consume of black rats had never been reported; the role of the <b>Channel-billed</b> <b>Toucan</b> in rat population control in urban centres must be evaluated in future studies...|$|E
