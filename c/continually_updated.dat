Sindy's senior designer Jane Braithwaite travelled to Paris each month to research fashion trends for Sindy's clothing {{in an attempt to}} reverse declining sales. As an example of Sindy's <b>continually</b> <b>updated</b> fashions, during this period the doll's footwear included kitten heels, sandals, knee-high boots, ankle boots, trainers, slippers, court shoes and slingbacks.|$|E

It is published annually by the Michigan State University Press.|$|E
5|$|Another {{influential}} early mainframe {{game was}} Baseball, a sports game {{that was created}} on a PDP-10 minicomputer at Pomona College in 1971 by English major Don Daglow. Baseball was the first baseball video game that allowed players to manage the game as it unfolded, rather than just picking players {{at the beginning of}} a game. The program is documented at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. Baseball was <b>continually</b> <b>updated</b> through 1974, and distributed to other PDP-10 installations. The text-based game had each player control the pitcher or the batter; they would enter their intention to, for example, pitch to or walk the batter, or switch hitters. The batting player could direct on-base players to steal, and the batter to hit. The results of the play would be printed out onto paper as a verbose description, like a radio description of the game. Daglow went on to develop more sophisticated baseball games in 1983 with Intellivision World Series Baseball, and 1987 with Earl Weaver Baseball, as well as numerous other games.|$|E

In 1975, researchers examining thousands of black-and-white photographs began to assemble a catalog containing a photograph of every killer whale in British Columbia's waters, a catalog that has been <b>continually</b> <b>updated</b> and used to this day.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only is the}} {{information}} contained within the database <b>continually</b> <b>updated,</b> the software itself has gone through several revisions. Version 1.0 of BIND was released in 1999 and based on user feedback it was modified to include additional detail on experimental conditions required for binding and a hierarchical description of cellular location of the interaction. Version 2.0 was released in 2001 and included the capability to link to information available in other databases. Version 3.0 (2002) expanded the database from physical/biochemical interactions to also include genetic interactions. Version 3.5 (2004) included a refined user-interface that aimed to simplify information retrieval. In 2006, BIND was incorporated into the Biomolecular Object Network Database (BOND) where {{it continues to be}} updated and improved.|$|E
25|$|The direct {{predecessor}} to the Registry of World Record Size Shells was World Size Records, {{compiled by}} renowned malacologists Robert J. L. Wagner (1905–1992) and R. Tucker Abbott (1919–1995). These record sizes originally appeared in 1964, {{in the first}} edition of Van Nostrand's Standard Catalog of Shells, not as a separate list but interspersed among other species-specific information that made up the bulk of the work. An updated list was published as part of the book's second edition, in 1967. The next update appeared in the work's third edition, which was renamed Wagner and Abbott's Standard Catalog of Shells. Unlike previous editions, this third and final installment of the catalog was a ring binder with loose-leaf content, intended as a <b>continually</b> <b>updated</b> resource. To match the newly retitled work, the list's name was modified to Wagner and Abbott's World Size Records. In this final incarnation, the list appeared as a series of four supplements: the first two were loose-leaf publications that appeared in 1978 and 1982, and these were followed by hole-punched paperback titles in 1985 and 1990.|$|E

25|$|Windows 8, the {{successor}} to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012. A number of significant changes were made on Windows 8, including {{the introduction of a}} user interface based around Microsoft's Metro design language with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one PCs. These changes include the Start screen, which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of <b>continually</b> <b>updated</b> information, and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices. Other changes include increased integration with cloud services and other online platforms (such as social networks and Microsoft's own OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) and Xbox Live services), the Windows Store service for software distribution, and a new variant known as Windows RT for use on devices that utilize the ARM architecture. An update to Windows 8, called Windows 8.1, was released on October 17, 2013, and includes features such as new live tile sizes, deeper OneDrive integration, and many other revisions. Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 has been subject to some criticism, such as removal of the Start menu.|$|E

500|$|The {{determination}} of an individual's ancestry is typically grouped into three historical groups, Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid. However, {{the use of}} these classifications is becoming much harder as the rate of interancestrial marriages increases and markers become less defined. [...] By measuring distances between landmarks on the skull as well as {{the size and shape of}} specific bones anthropologists can use a series of equations to estimate ancestry. Typically, the maxilla is used to help anthropologists determine an individual's ancestry due to the three basic shapes, hyperbolic, parabolic, and rounded, belonging to the three historical ancestries, Negroid, Caucasoid, and Mongoloid respectively. In addition to the maxilla, the zygomatic arch and the nasal opening have been used to narrow down possible ancestry. A program called FORDISC has been created that will calculate the most likely ancestry using complex mathematical formulas. This program is <b>continually</b> <b>updated</b> with new information from known individuals to maintain a database of current populations and their respective measurements.|$|E
