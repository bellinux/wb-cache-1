2500|$|Interpretation of {{the origin}} of the smooth plains is {{difficult}} but significant, because it bears directly on the internal constitution and thermal history of Mercury. Like the lunar maria, the smooth plains occur on the floors of large craters and basins, and the broad swath of plains around Caloris finds an analogy with Oceanus Procellarum around Imbrium on the Moon. However, the Caloris plains differ from the maria in having no observed positive-relief volcanic features such as those sparsely scattered on the lunar maria. The absence of sharp albedo differences between the smooth plains and the older terrain (Hapke and others, 1975), compared with the distinct difference in albedo between the lunar maria and highlands, may be more indicative of composition than of origin of the rocks. On the basis of distribution and volume, Strom and others argued that in most areas the smooth plains consist of extensive sheets of basic lava similar to the lunar maria. Schultz (1977), studying modified impact craters, also argued in favor of volcanism. On the other hand, Wilhelms pointed out that the lunar light plains could also serve as an analog of the mercurian smooth plains: Apollo 16 samples indicate that lunar light plains consist of <b>cataclastic</b> breccia and impact melt, interpreted as being emplaced by large impact events (James, 1977). Wilhelms, therefore, proposed that the smooth plains on Mercury {{may be related to the}} Caloris impact directly, as breccias and impact melts, rather than as lavas. However, the light plains on the Moon are nowhere so well developed or extensive as the plains around Caloris, and if Wilhelms’ explanation is correct, considerable differences must exist between large impact events on the Moon and Mercury. Most likely, large parts of the smooth plains are of volcanic origin, although in some areas they may be of impact-melt origin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cataclastic</b> flow usually {{occurs at}} diagenetic to low-grade {{metamorphic}} conditions, however this {{depends on the}} mineralogy of the material {{and the extent of}} pore fluid pressure, as high fluid pressure will promote <b>cataclastic</b> flow in any metamorphic environment. <b>Cataclastic</b> flow is generally instable and will terminate by the localization of deformation into slip on fault planes, where fault propagation can allow cataclasis to migrate into nearby areas of the rock volume.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cataclastic</b> flow is {{the main}} {{deformation}} mechanism accommodating large strains above the brittle-ductile transition zone. It {{can be regarded as}} a ductile mechanism, although one that takes place within the elastico-frictional regime of deformation. Deformation is accommodated by the sliding and rolling of fragments within the <b>cataclastic</b> rock. Cycles of cementation and refracturing are generally recognised in such rocks.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cataclastic</b> rock {{is a type}} of {{metamorphic}} rock that has been wholly or partly formed by the progressive fracturing and comminution of existing rock, a process known as cataclasis, and is mainly found associated with fault zones. Mylonite was originally defined as a <b>cataclastic</b> rock but is now understood to have formed mainly by crystal-plastic processes.|$|E
50|$|Five main {{mechanisms}} are recognized; <b>cataclastic</b> flow, dislocation creep, recrystallization, diffusive mass transfer and grain-boundary sliding.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>cataclastic</b> flow - {{microscopic}} ductile flow {{resulting from}} small grain-scale fracturing and frictional sliding distributed across a large area.|$|E
50|$|After {{those two}} initial deformations, several {{other types of}} {{secondary}} brittle deformation can be observed, such as frictional sliding or <b>cataclastic</b> flow on reactivated joints or faults.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{mechanism}} that operates under low to moderate homologous temperatures, low confining pressure and relatively high strain rates and involves fracturing, sliding and rolling of fragments, and further fragmentation of these into smaller particles. During <b>cataclastic</b> flow, a rock will deform without any obvious strain localization at the mesoscopic scale, yet {{the process of}} deformation is microfracturing and frictional sliding where tiny fractures, called microcracks, and the associated rock fragments move past each other. Frictional sliding is strongly pressure dependent, where with increasing pressure the ability of sliding is reduced. The microfractures can be intergranular (along grain boundaries) or intragranular (within individual grains), where the process occurs by breaking many atomic bonds at the same time; however the crystal structure away from the fracture is unaffected. <b>Cataclastic</b> flow can occur by grain-boundary sliding with limited continuous fracturing of grains, or continued fracturing and other deformation processes can limit the rate of <b>cataclastic</b> flow.|$|E
50|$|Cataclasite {{is a type}} of <b>cataclastic</b> {{rock that}} is formed by {{fracturing}} and comminution during faulting. It is normally cohesive and non-foliated, consisting of angular clasts in a finer-grained matrix.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic {{metamorphism}} {{is associated}} with zones of high to moderate strain such as fault zones. Cataclasis, crushing and grinding of rocks into angular fragments, occurs in dynamic metamorphic zones, giving <b>cataclastic</b> texture.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cataclastic</b> rocks form by brittle {{processes}} in {{the upper part of}} the crust in areas of moderate to high strain, particularly in fault zones. The two main mechanisms involved are microfracturing (breaking the original rock into fragments) and frictional sliding/rolling of the fragments, combined with further fracturing.|$|E
50|$|Deformation {{bands are}} present {{in a variety of}} porous rock types such as sandstones, limestones, siltstones, poorly welded {{volcanic}} tuffs, and breccias. The <b>cataclastic</b> and compactional bands often form seals and prevent the flow of groundwater or oil. In their formation grains shift their packing and are crushed.|$|E
50|$|Herald Island is {{composed}} of sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks. The northeastern tip of this island consists of a 600 m-thick sequence of sandstone, phyllite, quartzose sandstone, quartz-chlorite-sericite schist mylonite, and <b>cataclastic</b> quartz syenite. These rocks are of either Proterozoic or Late Paleozoic age. The bulk of this island consists of a Jurassic granite pluton.|$|E
5000|$|The Port Deposit Gneiss is a Paleozoic gneiss {{formation}} in Harford County, Maryland. It {{is described as}} a [...] "Moderately to strongly deformed intrusive complex, chiefly composed of quartz diorite gneiss. Rock types include gneissic biotite-quartz diorite, hornblende-biotite-quartz diorite, and biotite granodiorite, with minor amounts of quartz monzonite and hornblende-quartz diorite. Moderate protoclastic foliation grades into strong <b>cataclastic</b> shearing." [...] It intrudes into the Volcanic Complex of Cecil County.|$|E
50|$|The {{country rocks}} are traversed by three major north-south-striking faults (north of Chalamant, {{in the village}} center and near Le Rouchou de la Forêt), which offset the stratigraphy. The faults at Chalamant and Le Rouchou de la Forêt are {{brecciated}} and <b>cataclastic.</b> The latter is a major fault, it even cuts off tectonic units (like the oceanic Sarrazac Massif from the Upper Gneiss Unit); it {{can be traced to}} Sarrazac in the south, in the north it splays out.|$|E
50|$|Mylonites are ductilely {{deformed}} rocks {{formed by}} the accumulation of large shear strain, in ductile fault zones. There are many different views on the formation of mylonites, but it is generally agreed that crystal-plastic deformation must have occurred, and that fracturing and <b>cataclastic</b> flow are secondary processes {{in the formation of}} mylonites. Mechanical abrasion of grains by milling does not occur, although this was originally thought to be the process that formed mylonites, which were named from the Greek μύλος mylos, meaning mill.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the {{microcline}} in shear zones poses another problem. M.D. Higgins favours the possibility of recrystallization based on Ostwald ripening via metasomatic fluids. L.G. Collins supports a metsaomatic subsolidus growth (potassium- and silica-metasomatism) that has been initiated by ongoing tectonic cataclasis. [...] To be fully effective this process {{is dependent on the}} <b>cataclastic</b> breaking-up of the original crystals as realized in a ductile shear zone along {{the eastern edge of the}} Cathedral Peak Granodiorite (Gem Lake Shear Zone).|$|E

50|$|Cataclasite forms by the {{progressive}} fracturing of mineral grains and aggregates, {{a process known}} as cataclasis. The fracturing continues until a distribution of clast sizes is developed that allows the sliding of clasts past each other, without high enough frictional stresses to further fracture the rock significantly. From then on deformation is accommodated by continued sliding and rolling of fragments, a deformation mechanism known as <b>cataclastic</b> flow. In poorly consolidated or unconsolidated sediments, deformation in fault zones also occurs by rolling and sliding of grains but the porosity of the rock accommodates the resulting strains without significant grain fracturing.|$|E
50|$|Various {{classification}} schemes {{have been}} proposed for the <b>cataclastic</b> rocks, but changes in understanding of the processes involved in their formation and better knowledge {{of the variety of}} such rocks has made a simple classification difficult, particularly where distinctions cannot be made in hand specimens. Sibson's 1977 classification of fault rocks was the first to include an understanding of the deformation mechanisms involved and all subsequent schemes have been based on this.Fault breccias have been further classified in terms of their origins; attrition, distributed crush and implosion brecciation, and, borrowing from the cave-collapse literature, crack, mosaic and chaotic from their clast concentration.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} mechanisms that accommodate crystal-plastic deformation. In crustal rocks the most important processes are dislocation creep and diffusion creep. Dislocation generation acts to increase the internal energy of crystals. This effect is compensated through grain-boundary-migration recrystallization which reduces the internal energy by increasing the grain boundary area and reducing the grain volume, storing energy at the mineral grain surface. This process tends to organize dislocations into subgrain boundaries. As more dislocations are added to subgrain boundaries, the misorientation across that subgrain boundary will increase until the boundary becomes a high-angle boundary and the subgrain effectively becomes a new grain. This process, {{sometimes referred to as}} subgrain rotation recrystallization,acts to reduce the mean grain size. Volume and grain-boundary diffusion, the critical mechanisms in diffusion creep, become important at high temperatures and small grain sizes. Thus some researchers have argued that as mylonites are formed by dislocation creep and dynamic recrystallization, a transition to diffusion creep can occur once the grain size is reduced sufficiently.Mylonites generally develop in ductile shear zones where high rates of strain are focused. They are the deep crustal counterparts to <b>cataclastic</b> brittle faults that create fault breccias.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Kre volcanogenic massive sulfide {{deposits}} {{lie within}} the Kastamonu province {{in the western}} part of the Pontide tectonic belt of Turkey, and are hosted by ophiolite-related pre-Liassic basaltic sequences. Mineralogical studies of the pyritic massive sulfide deposits of the Kre mining district have shown that the sulfide assemblages, particularly pyrite, have undergone a history of deformation and metamorphism. The Kre volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits show a range of macroscopic and microscopic textures, which are also observed in metamorphosed VMS deposits elsewhere. These textures are <b>cataclastic,</b> annealing and fracture-filling textures which developed in two successive stages; <b>cataclastic</b> texture predominated during main deformational stages, whereas annealing and fracture filling textures predominate during late-deformational stages. <b>Cataclastic</b> texture predominantes in polycrystalline and coarser-grained pyrite. Little or no <b>cataclastic</b> texture is observed in single, fine-grained pyrite crystals. Annealing is characterized by recrystallization of pyrite, while fracture filling is characterized by replacement and infilling of <b>cataclastic</b> fractures in pyrite grains by chalcopyrite. <b>Cataclastic</b> deformation texture is likely to have formed at about 400 ¡C to 500 ¡C and at 1 kb to 3 kb pressures, typical of low-grade and/or greenschist-facies metamorphic conditions, whereas annealing textures dominate at temperatures over 500 ¡C— 550 ¡C and at 0. 69 kb to 1. 7 kb pressures, typical of upper greenschist-/amphibolite-facies metamorphism.

30|$|The {{branches}} of the CMVs with a <b>cataclastic</b> fabric intrude into cracks around the CMVs. However, this plastic deformation progressed via brittle deformation (sliding and rotation) at the grain scale.

However, the microstructures of these CMVs are totally {{different from those of}} the mylonite and fault gouges. An obvious comminution and grain-size reduction process in the <b>cataclastic</b> CMVs means that the structures of these veins have been changed by very rapid faulting events, maybe intense earthquakes.

In this study, we have analyzed a <b>cataclastic</b> shear-band network developed in uncemented porous sandstone in Provence, France. Geometrical analyses of the bands show significant differences between three types of bands (single strand, multistrand, and band cluster), sorted by their number of strands, their amount of shear displacement, and their thicknesses. At the microscopic scale, the image-analysis porosities and the grain-size distributions allow definition of three different types of microstructural deformation: damage zone, protocataclastic, and <b>cataclastic.</b> Whereas damage zone and protocataclastic deformations are observed in each type of band, <b>cataclastic</b> strands are observed in clusters and, sometimes, in multistrands. <b>Cataclastic</b> strands are characterized by a porosity reduction of 10 to 25 % and a permeability reduction of three to five orders of magnitude compared to the host rock.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of fracturing and cataclasis influences the mechanical and permeability properties of fault zones.

Our structural investigations in fault zones affecting carbonate platform rocks in the Apennines, Italy, allow us to propose an evolutionary model for the progressive development of <b>cataclastic</b> fault core rocks from damage zones, and for the progression of cataclasis in fault cores. Analyses of particle size in the <b>cataclastic</b> rocks show power law distributions with fractal dimensions spanning over a broad range.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{yet still}} unresolved puzzle provided by cataclasis is whether {{particle size reduction}} mostly progresses through time by the same fragmentation mechanism or not. Available field, laboratory and numerical modelling results {{on the evolution of}} <b>cataclastic</b> rocks are still controversial. The evidence that <b>cataclastic</b> rocks exert a primary control on the frictional strength, stability, seismic velocity and permeability properties of fault zones encourages further research on cataclasis. Here, we report data on particle shape from natural <b>cataclastic</b> rocks in poorly layered carbonates in the Apulian foreland of the Southern Apennines of Italy. Particle shape analyses show that particle angularity decreases with increasing size and, for a given size class, it decreases with increasing fractal dimension of the particle size distribution.

Carlsbad and Carlsbad-albite twins, presumed to be growth twins, occur mainly in rocks which show igneous texture, and which have not been severely brecciated. These two twin laws appear to be absent from <b>cataclastic</b> rocks, including <b>cataclastic</b> anorthosite, possibly because the original twins were preferentially broken up in cataclasis (the composition plane being a plane of weakness).

40|$|In the Mont Blanc Helvetic massif, granites record {{mesoscale}} Alpine structures, {{which include}} joints, veins, <b>cataclastic</b> to mylonitic shear zones and foliated granites. A detailed structural analysis indicates that brittle deformation predates plastic strain. Joints never pass through, and veins are offset by, <b>cataclastic</b> shear zones and mylonites. The mylonites progressively develop by plastic reactivation of <b>cataclastic</b> shear zones during greenschist facies metamorphic conditions. Plastic deformation is first localized in the brittle discontinuities and the fine-grained matrix of cataclasites. Then {{it involves the}} granite within brittle shear zones, and this is initially accomplished mainly by flow of reaction-softened aggregates of sericite, widely replacing the strain-supporting magmatic plagioclase. The brittle-to-plastic evolution has resulted in highly localized discontinuous plastic shear zones with high lateral continuity, and these characteristics are derived from reactivation of, and focusing along, pre-existing brittle discontinuities. In addition, mylonites may inherit high angles of intersection, and may contain granite porphyroclasts. These features may allow the inference of a precursor brittle deformation where the plastic overprint has completely erased the initial brittle fabrics...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{distribution of}} <b>cataclastic</b> rocks along faults deeply influences their mechanical and permeability properties. Despite their importance for seismic hazard and fluid flow, physical parameters controlling location of <b>cataclastic</b> rocks are still poorly constrained. We present results of three-dimensional numerical models specifically implemented for investigating {{the role of}} physical parameters enhancing the formation and location of <b>cataclastic</b> rocks along faults. Seven favourable conditions have been identified: failure under uniaxial stress conditions; failure by residual stress; failure by stress drop; interference of differently-oriented fracture populations, block rotation; fracturing of a previously fractured material, and rock anisotropy. Their weighted combination with boundary conditions including the geometry and kinematics of the fault surface, the overburden, the regional and kinematic stress fields, the rock rheology and strength, and pore fluid pressure, provide a scalar value proportional to the relative probability of cataclasis along the fault. Such a scalar value is named cataclasite generation function.

40|$|The {{present study}} makes {{part of a}} {{research}} project on the geological and geomechanical characterisation of weak <b>cataclastic</b> fault rocks encountered in underground excavation sites in the Alps. The project is composed of a geological and a geomechanical part, split up in two PhD theses and realised in parallel at the Laboratory of Geology (GEOLEP) and the Laboratory of Rock Mechanics (LMR) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. By their very contrasting and unfavourable mechanical behaviour in underground excavations, weak <b>cataclastic</b> fault zones influence directly the excavation method, {{the safety of the}} working site, the choice of tunnel support, the long-term behaviour and the costs of the infrastructure. The construction of galleries across <b>cataclastic</b> fault zones bears furthermore the potential risk to modify the local and regional hydrogeological regime. Weak <b>cataclastic</b> fault rocks show a large scatter of geological and geomechanical properties. Due to their low cohesion, they alter rapidly when exposed to weathering. They can hence be studied and sampled in natural outcrops and exploratory boreholes only with great difficulty. Analyses and laboratory tests are laborious and require special sample preparation techniques and equipments. For these reasons still little is known about their geological, hydrogeological and geomechanical behaviour. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a detailed and objective differentiation and characterisation method for weak <b>cataclastic</b> fault rocks. Classifications and terminologies of (weak) <b>cataclastic</b> fault rocks are in fact still controversial. After a review of fault rock definitions and rock deformation mechanisms, the term kakirite has been retained in agreement with Heitzmann (1985) and Wyder (1997) as a general designation for weak, cohesionless <b>cataclastic</b> fault rocks. This term has been approved recently by the Swiss Society of Engineers and Architects (SIA) to designate fault zones made up of "loose, structureless material" (SIA Norm 199, 1998). <b>Cataclastic</b> fault zones have been studied and sampled in galleries currently under construction in different geological and tectonic contexts in the Alps. Research has been concentrated mainly on fault zones occurring in quartzo-phyllitic host rocks. For comparison, fault rocks from greenstones and serpentinite have been analysed too. To improve the understanding of the geomechanical and hydrogeological behaviour of weak <b>cataclastic</b> fault rocks, a new quantitative characterisation method has been developed. In a simplified approach, the geomechanical behaviour of (fault) rocks is considered to be controlled by two factors, namely the: mineralogical composition (mwVh), and rock fabric (TC, MC) The proposed mineralogical and structural characterisation of <b>cataclastic</b> fault rocks is referring to the meso- to microscopic scale, respectively to a scale comparable with common geomechanical laboratory tests. Mineralogy is expressed quantitatively by means of the mean weighted Vickers hardness, mwVh (Calembert et al., 1980 a). The relative proportions of the principal rock forming minerals have been determined by semi-quantitative XRD-analyses. The mineralogical composition of kakirites, adjacent host rock samples and sieved kakirite grainsize fractions has been determined. Comparing the composition of the different grainsize fractions a clear dependency of grainsize on mineralogical composition has been found in kakirites. Quartz content is in general considerably higher in the clast than in the matrix fraction. The later is in fact composed mainly of phyllosilicates. This mineralogical grainsize fractionation is interpreted to be controlled by the original host rock fabric, the strength contrast between the involved mineral phases and alteration processes. Except kaolinite (Varzo), no other alteration mineral phases have been identified. The presence of (swelling) clay-minerals in very low proportions which cannot be detected by the performed whole rock XRD-analyses cannot be excluded however. Kakirite samples sieved for XRD-analyses show an extended grainsize distributions with in general high proportions of silt/clay grainsize fraction (mean 45 %). This may explain the often observed very low permeability of kakirite zones. Their hydrogeological role is illustrated in the last part of this work by the means of a case history of a fault zone crossed by the gallery of Cleuson-Dixence. It demonstrates the often observed groundwater flow barrier-effect of <b>cataclastic</b> fault zones and its impact on the excavation work and the local hydrogeological regime. Rock fabric of kakirites has been characterised by thin section analyses with subsequent semiautomatic image analysis. It is based on a two-phase "clast-matrix" model, considering kakirites to be composed of varying proportions of "hard" clasts and "weak", fine-grained matrix. Clast properties (density, shape and relative orientation) are quantified by the texture coefficient (TC) of Howarth & Rowlands (1987). Pre-existing discontinuities in the matrix are characterised by a newly developed matrix coefficient (MC), involving the discontinuity density, roughness, mean length and relative orientation. The combined structural approach involving the MC and TC has shown to be appropriate to characterise and differentiate a wide range of weak <b>cataclastic</b> fault rocks by their microscopic rock fabric. Two opposite kakirite fabric types can be distinguished: first, a granular fabric, characterised by clasts taken in a fine-grained, isotropic matrix. Second, a discontinuity dominant, often schistose fabric wherein no clasts can be identified. A gradual transition is observed in-between these two end-member types. In order to assess the validity of the developed characterisation method, a first attempt of correlation has been made between the mineralogical-structural parameters and corresponding rock strength of kakirites tested by Habimana (1999). The found correlation is a strong motivation to continue the started research on <b>cataclastic</b> fault rocks with the presented mineralogical and structural approach...|$|E
40|$|We present {{particle}} size data from 31 samples of carbonate <b>cataclastic</b> rocks collected across the 26 m thick fault core of the Mattinata Fault in the foreland of the Southern Apennines, Italy. Particle size distributions of incoherent samples were determined by a sieving-and-weighting technique. The number of weight-equivalent spherical particles by size is well fitted by a power-law function on a log-log space. Fractal dimensions (D) of {{particle size}} distributions are in the 2. 091 - 2. 932 range and cluster around the value of ~ 2. 5. High D-values pertain to gouge in shear bands reworking the bulk <b>cataclastic</b> rocks of the fault core. Low D-values characterise immature <b>cataclastic</b> breccias. Intermediate D-values are typical of the bulk fault core. Analysis of the ratio between corresponding equivalent particle numbers from differently evolved <b>cataclastic</b> rocks indicates {{that the development of}} particle size distributions with D > 2. 6 - 2. 7 occurred by a preferential relative increase of fine particles rather than a selective decrement of coarse particles. This preferentially occurred in shear bands where intense comminution enhanced by slip localisation progressed by rolling of coarse particles whose consequent smoothing produced a large number of fine particles. Our data suggest that during the progression of cataclasis, the fragmentation mode changed from the Allègre et al. 's (1982) "pillar of strength" mechanism in the early evolutionary stages, to the Sammis et al. 's (1987) "constrained comminution " mechanism in the subsequent stages of cataclasis. Eventually, localised shear bands developed mainly by abrasion of coarse particles...|$|E
40|$|International audienceImproving the {{prediction}} of sub-seismic structures and their petrophysical properties is essential for realistic characterization of deformed sandstone reservoirs. In the present paper, we describe permeability contrasts induced by <b>cataclastic</b> deformation bands and faults in porous sandstones (766 data synthesized from field examples and the literature). We also discuss the influence of several factors, including tectonic regime, presence of a fault, burial depth, host sandstone porosity, and grain size and sorting for their initiation and permeability. This analysis confirms that permeability decrease is {{as a function of}} grain-crushing intensity in bands. Permeability reduction ranges from very limited in crush-microbreccia of compaction bands to high permeability reduction in cataclasites and ultracataclasites of shear-dominated bands, band clusters and faults. Tectonic regime, and especially normal-fault regime, with its tendency to localize strain and generate faults, is identified as the most important factor, leading to the formation of <b>cataclastic</b> bands with high permeability contrasts. Moreover, moderate burial depth (1 – 3 km) favors <b>cataclastic</b> bands with high permeability contrasts with respect to the host sandstone. High porosity, coarse-grain size and good grain sorting can slightly amplify the permeability reductions recorded in bands...|$|E
