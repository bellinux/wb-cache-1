Cracked gas is contaminated with acid gases (e.g., H 2 S and CO 2) as well as “low oxygenates” (e.g., formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde). H 2 S (originating from sulfur containing species in the feedstock) and CO 2 (originating from coking/decoking reactions in the furnace) can poison catalysts and degrade {{the quality of the}} final product. Such contaminants are thus removed by <b>caustic</b> <b>scrubbing,</b> which consists in circulating a weak sodium hydroxide solution (~ 1  wt%) {{in one part of the}} column and a strong sodium hydroxide solution (5 – 10  wt%) in the other part of the column.|$|E

40|$|Researchers {{developing}} {{technologies for}} treatment of mixed (both hazardous and radioactive) wastes are strongly encouraged to test using materials representative of the wastes targeted by their processes. Using actual wastes is essential for treatability studies and demonstrations prior to implementation, but is excessively costly and impractical during development. Thus, it is a responsibility of the focus area to provide researchers with surrogate recipes for use in development. Data from tests with standardized recipes will also facilitate comparison of results for competing technologies by potential end users and industry. Due to {{the wide range of}} waste materials in the DOE inventory and the scope of technology covered by the focus area, no one surrogate will accurately represent all wastes in all applications. The surrogates described are based on generic base compositions representative of that class of wastes, with variable constituents to be added over a recommended test range. Not all of the additives must be tested for each technology; focus should be directed to the constituents and physical forms present in the waste streams targeted by the developer. Excluding some parameters, or reducing the parametric testing rather than using the full range of concentration recommended simply limits the scope of potential application when the data is considered by a potential user. Surrogates are described for debris, sludges, and <b>caustic</b> <b>scrub</b> solution. Soils are recognized as a fourth class, and are considered too complex to represent with a surrogate. Descriptive text is also included to explain how the recipes were developed, and why each test additive is prescribed...|$|R

40|$|Recently, new biotechnological {{processes}} {{have been}} developed to enable the sustainable removal of organic and inorganic sulfur compounds from liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon streams. In comparison to existing technologies (e. g., <b>caustic</b> <b>scrubbing</b> or iron based redox technologies) far less chemicals are consumed, while reusable elemental sulfur is formed as the main end-product. This research shows that in these processes a number of consecutive reactions occur between methanethiol (MT) from the hydrocarbon stream and the formed biosulfur particles, leading to the formation of (dimethyl) polysulfides. This is an important feature of this family of new bioprocesses as it improves the MT removal efficiency. The reaction kinetics depend on the MT and biosulfur concentration, temperature, {{and the nature of the}} biosulfur particles. The first reaction step involves a S(8) ring-opening by nucleophilic attack of MT molecules to form CH(3) S(9) (-). This work shows that CH(3) S(9) (-) reacts to polysulfides (S(3) (2 -), S(4) (2 -), S(5) (2 -)), dimethyl polysulfides [(CH(3)) (2) S(2), (CH(3)) (2) S(3) ], and dissociated H(2) S, while also some longer-chain dimethyl polysulfides [(CH(3)) (2) S(4) -(7) ] are formed at µM levels.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{development}} of a newbiotechnological process for the treatment of undiluted sulfidic spent caustics (SSC’s) using soda lake bacteria is described. SSC’s are waste solutions that are formed in {{the oil and gas industry}} due to the <b>caustic</b> (NaOH) <b>scrubbing</b> of hydrocarbon streams for the removal of sulfur compounds. Without treatment, SSC’s may impose serious environmental problems because of their alkalinity (pH> 12), salinity (Na + 5 - 12 wt%) and high sulfide (HS - and S 2 -) levels. Depending on the hydrocarbon stream that is treated, SSC’s may also contain organic sulfur compounds and monoaromatic hydrocarbons. Biological treatment of undiluted SSC’s would be a cheaper and safer alternative to the currently applied physico-chemical treatment methods (e. g., wet air oxidation or deep well disposal) since no additional chemicals are needed and the process works at ambient pressure and temperature conditions. In chapter 2 the biological treatment of refinery SSC’s is described in continuously fed systems under haloalkaline conditions (i. e. pH 9. 5; Na + 0. 8 M). The experiments were performed in gas-lift bioreactors operated under aerobic conditions at 35 o C. Sulfide removal was complete up to 27 mmol L - 1 day - 1 by conversion to sulfate (SO 4 2 -). The sulfide conversion was accomplished by haloalkaliphilic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (HA-SOB) belonging to the genus Thioalkalivibrio. Members of the this genus are extremophiles that are able to oxidize sulfide under a broad range of haloalkaline conditions (0. 3 - 4. 3 M Na + and up to pH 10. 6). In this chapter, it wasalso shown that benzene, at influent concentrations ranging from 100 to 600 µM, was removed by 93 % due to air-stripping and biodegradation. Microbial community analysis revealed the presence of haloalkaliphilic heterotrophic bacteria belonging to the genera Marinobacter, Halomonas andIdiomarina which might have been involved in the observed benzene removal. Sour gases and SSC’s may also contain elevated amounts of methanethiol (MT; CH 3 SH). Hence, knowledge on the potential toxic effects of these type of compounds on the performance of this biotechnological process is required. Under sulfur (S 0) forming conditions, MT reacts with biologically produced S 0 particles resulting in a mixture of inorganic polysulfides (S x 2 -), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS). Respiration experiments with HA-SOB (Thioalkalivibrio mix) show in chapter 3 that biological oxidation of sulfide to S 0 is inhibited by 50 % (Ki value) at 0. 05 mM MT. The measured Ki values for DMDS and DMTS were 1. 5 and 1. 0 mM, respectively. As DMDS and DMTS are products from the reaction between MT and S 0, this reaction results in a partial detoxification of MT in a S 0 -producing bioreactor. The results from the respiration experiments as shown in chapter 3 indicate that the application of the biotechnological process for the treatment of H 2 S and MT containing gases and SSC’s is feasible as long as MT, DMDS and DMTS do not accumulate in the bioreactor. Accumulation of MT can be prevented by auto-oxidation of MT to DMDS, by the reaction between MT and biosulfur particles or biodegradation. Chapter 4 discusses the biological treatment of synthetically prepared SSC’s containing both sulfide and DMDS. Continuously fed gas-lift bioreactor experiments showed that biological sulfide oxidation (4 - 10 mmol L - 1 day - 1) is possible in the presence of low concentrations of DMDSunder haloalkaline conditions (i. e., pH 9. 5; Na + 0. 8 M). Sulfide was completely oxidized to SO 4 2 - by members of the genus Thioalkalivibrio (closely related to Thioalkalivibriosp. K 90 -mix). It was also shown that severe inhibition of thebiological sulfide oxidation capacity and process deterioration occurs at DMDS effluent concentrations between 0. 1 and 0. 9 mM. The measured DMDS removal efficiency amounted up to 40 - 70 % (0. 05 - 0. 37 DMDS-S L - 1 day - 1), of which 25 % could be attributed to air stripping. It is yet unclear what other processes contributed to the total DMDS removal and it can only be speculated that the remainder was removed by biological conversion and/or adsorption. Results from respiration experiments presented in chapter 4 reveal that pure cultures of HA-SOB (Thioalkalivibrio sp. K 90 -mix and Thioalkalivibrio sulfidophilus) as well as biosludge taken from a full-scale installation for H 2 S removal (Thiopaq) are more severely inhibited by MT than DMDS. Furthermore, the Ki values for DMDS and MT were lower for Thioalkalivibrio sp. K 90 -mix and Thioalkalivibrio sulfidophilus compared to Thiopaq sludge. From bioreactor and respiration experiments it follows that, to ensure stable process conditions, MT and DMDS concentrations need to be below 0. 02 and 0. 1 mM, respectively. This clearly demonstrates that treating SSC’s with elevated MT and DMDS concentrations will easily inhibit the sulfide oxidation capacity of the process. Although auto-oxidation of MT will result in (partial) detoxification due to the formation of DMDS, the effluent levels still need to be kept very low. Successful biological treatment of MT and DMDS containing SSC’s will depend on the biological degradation of these compounds. When rapid biodegradation of organic VSC’s can be achieved, the concentrations in the reactor will remain below the critical levels. Chapter 5 shows that the application of a newly developed 2 -step process for the biological treatments of SSC’s using HA-SOB allows significantly higher sulfide removal efficiencies compared to a 1 -step process. The detoxification of sulfide by the abiotic oxidation to thiosulfate (S 2 O 3 2 -) in the first chemical oxidation step and the subsequent complete biological oxidation in the second step allowed total-S loading rates up to 33 mmol L - 1 day - 1. Experiments with synthetically prepared solutions were performed in a continuously fed system consisting of two gas-lift reactors in series. These reactors were operated at haloalkaline (pH 9. 5; Na + 0. 8 M) and aerobic conditions at 35 o C. Mathematical modelling of the 2 -step process shows that under the prevailing conditions an optimal reactor configuration consists of 40 % ‘abiotic’ and 60 % ‘biological’ volume, whilst the total reactor volume is 22 % smaller than for the 1 -step process. The major advantages of a 2 -step process are the improved anticipation to shock loads of sulfideand lower investment and operational costs due to downsizing of the total reactor volume. Further research regarding the biological treatment of SSC’s may involve the potential of heterotrophic soda lake bacteria for the degradation of organic VSC’s as well as the mechanisms of toxicity of these compounds...|$|R
40|$|Infilco Degremont’s {{efficient}} {{sludge treatment}} process using a High Temperature Fluidized Bed (HTFB) incinerator {{is used by}} several waste processing plants in the United States and Canada. In a few instances, a buildup of ammonium bisulfate within the activated carbon bed absorbers has become an issue. The carbon bed absorbers are used {{for the removal of}} mercury from the incinerator flue gas. Buildup of this compound on the carbon surface results in increases in the pressure drop across the adsorber, as well as decreases in the efficiency of the unit. This eventually leads to the need to shutdown the afflicted train in order to clean the absorbers and replace the activated carbon. Based upon literature research, it is believed that sulfuric acid aerosols in the system reacts with ammonia entering the gas stream from the scrubber service water to form ammonium bisulfate. In order to reduce the production of ammonium bisulfate aerosols within the gas stream, a <b>caustic</b> <b>scrubbing</b> system will be added to the system to neutralize acidic sulfur oxide species present in the waste gas. Process information provided by Infilco was used to develop a process simulation through AspenTech. Using this simulation, recommendations for the rate of sodium hydroxide addition in the gas scrubber were made. Furthermore, the change in aerosol formation due to the reduction in sulfuric acid was estimated. [URL]...|$|E
