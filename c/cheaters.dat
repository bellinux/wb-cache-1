5|$|Over the years, {{there have}} been various small controversies, the most infamous being the scandal {{involving}} the Steinmetz High School team, which was caught cheating at the 1995 Illinois state finals. This event was later dramatized in the 2000 film <b>Cheaters.</b> Academic Decathlon has been criticized by educators {{for the amount of}} time it requires students to spend on the material, as it constitutes an entire curriculum beyond the one provided by the school. Around the turn of the millennium, several coaches protested the USAD's decision to publish error-ridden Resource Guides rather than provide topics for students to research.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the game, feeling insulted, Tregubov {{refused to}} shake his hand. Two days after the game, Tregubov and his team would {{complain}} to arbiters about his suspect strong play, and his frequent toilet breaks. On the second day, Bindrich had the black pieces against Sebastian Siebrecht and on move 10, he took a second toilet break. Siebrecht, having played such <b>cheaters</b> as Christoph Natsidis in the past, suspected that he was using an analysis program on his smartphone. On Bindrich's return an arbiter asked to search him and that he give over his smartphone, which under tournament rules, the refereee is allowed to do. Bindrich refused to hand it over, saying that there was private information on the phone, and he was forfeited the game.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} during the preparations (May) for the Olympiad, Israel Gelfer (the Chairman of FIDE's Anti-cheating Committee) {{said that the}} issue of anti-cheating became important {{in the last couple of}} years, with the development of telecommunication technologies (mobile phones, watches and even glasses) that have caused a problem which cannot be ignored. Gelfer explained that they are trying to balance between their will to fight against <b>cheaters</b> and at the same time not to create an unhealthy atmosphere in the chess world. The usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed, while novel procedures included: having a special anti-cheating arbiter (Klaus Deventer) with approximately 15 arbiters under his authority, one of whose charges was to carry out 30–40 checks during the round; and that players MUST inform their Match Arbiter when leaving the playing area.|$|E

30|$|<b>Cheater</b> Detection Scheme (CDS): The <b>Cheater</b> Detection Scheme (CDS) for a node is a {{mechanism}} that broadcasts fake congestion events. This approach {{is based on}} local velocity and distance {{with the help of}} a radar to verify the congestion event. It uses a kinematic wave to detect congestion period and distance. It is a very effective technique against fake IDs and sent false congestion event because kinematic wave packets contain signatures and certificates. In kinematics, a wave packet is used for detection of non-existing congestion event in VANETs. This is an effective technique for single misbehaviour vehicle (<b>cheater),</b> but when the <b>cheater</b> increases, then the detection process will take more time because the distance between the leading <b>cheater</b> and the last <b>cheater</b> increases as well [71].|$|R

5|$|The game uses {{medals and}} rewards, which are awarded for certain tasks. As of v1.50, the game {{supports}} trophies, {{which will be}} used in the online service PlayStation Home. Players are also able to customize their characters with armor squad markings, Warhawk paint schemes, and other accessories. More customization options are unlocked as the player increases in rank. Warhawk also allows the creation of clans, which may participate in online events and competitions. The game also makes use of arbiters, paid anonymous players who are tasked to find <b>cheaters</b> within the game. They are able to punish offending players in several ways, such as an email warning, a forum post, a kick, or a temporary/permanent ban. Arbiters can also request that the player's stats be erased.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days before}} the 1995 Illinois state competition, Steinmetz High School {{obtained}} copies of the tests from the DeVry Institute of Technology, where the state finals were being held. The team was therefore able to look up and memorize the answers. The cheating allowed Steinmetz to beat perennial powerhouse Whitney Young Magnet High School, who had won the Illinois state finals in 22 of the previous 23 years. Six of the twelve students in the nation who scored over 900 points on the math test came from Steinmetz High School, prompting the Illinois state Academic Decathlon to suspect cheating. The Steinmetz team was disqualified after team members refused to take an alternate version of the test, and its coach eventually resigned. The incident was dramatized in the movie <b>Cheaters.</b>|$|E

25|$|P. aeruginosa {{relies on}} iron as a {{nutrient}} source {{in order to}} grow. However, iron is not easily accessible {{because it is not}} commonly found in the environment. Iron is usually found in a largely insoluble ferric form. Furthermore, excessively high levels of iron can be toxic to P. aeruginosa. To overcome this and regulate proper intake of iron, P. aeruginosa uses siderophores. Siderophores are secreted molecules that bind and transport iron. These iron-siderophore complexes, however, are non-specific. The bacterium that produced the siderophores does not necessarily receive the direct benefit of iron intake. Rather all members of the cellular population are equally likely to access the iron-siderophore complexes. This dynamic is an example of an altruistic interaction; members suffer the metabolic cost of siderophores production {{for the good of the}} group. Members of the cellular population that can efficiently produce these siderophores are commonly referred to as cooperators; members that produce little to no siderophores are often referred to as <b>cheaters.</b> Research has shown when cooperators and <b>cheaters</b> are grown together, cooperators have a decrease in fitness while <b>cheaters</b> have an increase in fitness. It is observed that the magnitude of change in fitness increases with increasing iron-limitation. With an increase in fitness, the <b>cheaters</b> can outcompete the cooperators; this leads to an overall decrease in fitness of the group, due to lack of sufficient siderophore production. These observations suggest that having a mix of cooperators and <b>cheaters</b> can reduce the virulent nature of P. aeruginosa.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of answer copying on the ability level {{estimates}} of <b>cheater</b> examinees in answer copying pairs. The study generated answer copying pairs for each of 1440 conditions, source ability (12) x <b>cheater</b> ability (12) x amount of copying (10). The average difference between the ability level estimates before answer copying and after answer copying was examined. The results indicate that there is no gain on average from answer copying for the <b>cheater</b> examinee when both <b>cheater</b> and source examinees are in the same ability level interval. The gain from answer copying is higher as the source examinee’s ability level increases. The results also indicate that the gain and loss from answer copying is not the same when the source and <b>cheater</b> examinee exchange their position in the answer copying pair. The results indicate that answer copying on multiple-choice tests may have an important effect on the observed ability level estimate of a <b>cheater</b> examinee even for the small amount of copying. Answer copying behavior causes invalid test scores when the difference between the ability levels of the source and <b>cheater</b> examinees get larger. Answer copying can invalidate the test scores and high stake decisions based on the standard test scores. The educators should b...|$|R

50|$|A {{real-time}} strategy {{game where}} a player takes control {{of one of}} three factions in a 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 battle arena. The player must defeat his opponents by extinguishing all their opponents units and bases. This is accomplished by creating units that are effective at countering your opponents units. Players can play against multiple different levels of AI difficulty ranging from very easy to <b>cheater</b> 3 (insane). The AI is able to cheat at the difficulty, <b>cheater</b> 1 (vision), where it begins to have vision assistance on your location and units. <b>Cheater</b> 2 gives the AI extra resources, while <b>Cheater</b> 3 give an extensive advantage over its opponent.|$|R

25|$|Research {{has shown}} that sub-therapeutic levels of β-lactam {{antibiotics}} induce biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus. This sub-therapeutic level of antibiotic may result {{from the use of}} antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture, or during the normal course of antibiotic therapy. The biofilm formation induced by low-level methicillin was inhibited by DNase, suggesting that the sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotic also induce extracellular DNA release. Moreover, from an evolutionary point of view, the creation of the tragedy of the commons in pathogenic microbes may provide advanced therapeutic ways for chronic infections caused by biofilms via genetically engineered invasive <b>cheaters</b> who can invade wild-types ‘cooperators’ of pathogenic bacteria until cooperator populations go to extinction or overall population ‘cooperators and <b>cheaters</b> ’ go to extinction.|$|E
