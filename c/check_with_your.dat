40|$|Philosophers and laymen alike have {{traditionally}} assumed that {{whether you can}} reason well, make valid inferences, avoid logical mistakes and so forth is entirely {{a matter of how}} well the cogs in your head are fashioned and oiled. Partner to this is the assumption that careful reflection is always the method by which we discover whether an inference or reasoning process is correct.

Validity is best <b>checked</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> eyes tightly closed so you can attend solely to the internal relations among your ideas. There seems no need to defend these assumptions, nor, to my knowledge, has anyone ever tried. They are pure common sense. Occasionally, however, common sense is a repository for obdurate error.

Clear thinking is possible only as embedded in a cooperative external world.

However, {{little is known}} about how patient knowledge and outcome expectations may influence antidepressant adherence {{and persistence}}. Method: Individuals who had been prescribed their first antidepressant to treat depression in the preceding 6  months were recruited to an online survey via Facebook. Knowledge, education received, and initial outcome expectations were analyzed for associations with persistence and adherence. Results: Two hundred and twenty surveys were analyzed. A total of 117 participants had taken their antidepressant for at least 3  months; another 25 had never started or stopped after < 3  months without consulting their doctor. Differences in expectations and various educational messages among persistent and nonpersistent participants were identified. Having received the instruction “don’t stop it without <b>checking</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> doctor” was a significant independent predictor of persistence (odds ratio [OR] = 5. 9, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 4 – 24. 5). At the time of the survey, 82. 7 % of participants were taking an antidepressant and 77. 9 % were adherent. Significant independent predictors of adherence were a greater age (OR = 1. 1, 95 % CI = 1. 0 – 1. 2), knowledge (OR = 1. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 1 – 2. 3), being informed of common side effects (OR = 5. 5, 95 % CI = 1. 1 – 29. 0), and having discussed ways to solve problems (OR = 3. 9, 95 % CI = 1. 1 – 14. 5). Conclusion: Improving outcome expectations and particular educational messages may increase adherence and persistence. Greater knowledge may enhance adherence. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether a focus on these simple educational messages will improve outcomes in patients who commence an antidepressant.

5000|$|According to the US DOE's [...] "Guidelines for Selecting Cool Roofs" [...] on {{the subject}} of cool roof maintenance:"As a cool roof becomes dirty from pollution, foot traffic, wind-deposited debris, ponded water, and mold or algae growth, its {{reflectance}} will decrease, leading to higher temperatures. Especially dirty roofs may perform substantially worse than product labels indicate. Dirt from foot traffic may be minimized by specifying designated walkways or by limiting access to the roof. Steep sloped roofs have less of a problem with dirt accumulation because rainwater can more easily wash away dirt and debris. Some cool roof surfaces are “self-cleaning” which means they shed dirt more easily and may better retain their reflectance. Cleaning a cool roof can restore solar reflectance close to its installed condition. Always <b>check</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> roof manufacturer for the proper cleaning procedure, as some methods may damage your roof. While it is generally not cost effective to clean a roof just for the energy savings, roof cleaning can be integrated as one component of your roof’s routine maintenance program.

40|$|ABSTRACT – NHS ePortfolio is {{currently}} the standard assess-ment method used for most UK training programmes, from the Foundation Programme to core and specialty training years. This article discusses the terminology used in online assessments and gives a hands-on guide for trainees in how to successfully use ePortfolio. KEY WORDS: Foundation Programme, ePortfolio, trainees If you {{have been involved in}} any UK-based postgraduate medical training (as either a supervisor, an assessor or a trainee) over the past few years, you are likely to have had some experience with the NHS ePortfolio system. What began with a pilot programme in 2004 – 05 escalated to use by the vast majority of foundation trainees in 2007. 1 Its use is now standard throughout not only the foundation training programme in the UK but also the specialty training pro-grammes, including medical specialty training, general practitioner training and anaesthetic training. 2, 3 Despite ePortfolio’s widespread use, recent survey data from the Northern Deanery showed that a mere 25 % of foundation trainees thought that it was ‘a good idea’, while 81. 7 % of them felt it involved ‘excessive bureaucracy’. 4 Meanwhile, a cross-sectional survey of core medical trainees found that most (84 %) agreed that ongoing progress records of some sort was necessary but few (5 %) felt confident about ePortfolio’s value for money. 5 Whether or not you like online portfolio systems, ePortfolio seems here to stay as a tool for assessment and advancement. Most ePortfolios change on an annual to semi-annual basis to reflect both changes in the intended curriculum and attempts to improve ease of use. As such, I will mainly address the broad concepts and give some advice on how to survive <b>your</b> experience <b>with</b> the ePortfolio. Tip: Always <b>check</b> details <b>with</b> <b>your</b> own curriculum and ePortfolio. The ePortfolio has a number of different parts that vary between training schemes (especially outside of foundation and core training). However, the general elements within most ePortfolios are similar, so I shall examine them in turn. Tip: As soon as you get your username details, try to log in to the web-site.
