40|$|This paper reviews recent {{developments}} {{in the application of}} the boundary element method (BEM) to muffler and silencer analysis. Initial results of modeling built-in <b>catalyst</b> <b>converters</b> are also presented. A so-called “direct mixed-body boundary element method ” has been developed for muffler and silencer analysis since 1996. The idea of the method is to integrate all kinds of different boundary and internal surfaces into a single integral equation set without using the conventional multi-domain approach, even though there may be different media in the domain. A key ingredient in this method is the hypersingular integral equation. The concept of the direct mixed-body BEM is not totally against the conventional multi-domain BEM, though. For very large structures or at high frequencies, a multi-domain or substructuring approach is still necessary {{in order to reduce the}} memory usage as well as the computation time. With the direct mixed-body BEM, each substructure does not need to be a well-defined and homogeneous subdomain. As such, substructuring can be done more naturally along the longitudinal direction. <b>Catalyst</b> <b>converters</b> may also be modeled as a modular in the general framework of substructuring. Several test cases are presented with experimental verification, including two cases with built-in converters...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOn-board {{measurements}} of unit emissions of CO, HC, NOx and CO 2 {{were conducted on}} 17 private cars powered by different types of fuels including gasoline, dual gasoline-LPG, gasoline, and diesel. The tests performed revealed the effect of LPG injection technology on unit emissions and {{made it possible to}} compare the measured emissions to the European Artemis emission model. A sequential multipoint injection LPG kit with no catalyst installed was found to be the most efficient pollutant reduction device for all of the pollutants, {{with the exception of the}} NOx. Specific test results for a subgroup of LPG vehicles revealed that LPG-fueled engines with no catalyst cannot compete with catalyzed gasoline and diesel engines. Vehicle age does not appear to be a determining parameter with regard to vehicle pollutant emissions. A fuel switch to LPG offers many advantages as far as pollutant emissions are concerned, due to LPG's intrinsic characteristics. However, these advantages are being rapidly offset by the strong development of both gasoline and diesel engine technologies and <b>catalyst</b> <b>converters.</b> The LPG's performance on a chassis dynamometer under real driving conditions was better than expected.

40|$|Ammonia {{emissions}} are mainly related to agricultural activities, and depositions {{related to these}} emissions constitute a treat to local ecosystems but possibly also to human health through the contribution for formation of secondary fine fraction particles in ambient air. European ammonia {{emissions are}} highly heterogeneously distributed, and the temporal variations in these emissions follow very different pattern {{as a result of}} differences in climate but also as a results of significant differences in agricultural practice over Europe. A minor fraction of ammonia emission is related to nonagricultural sources, especially traffic.

For the spatial distribution various emission inventories are available at different resolutions. These inventories are derived using different approaches, and as a result they can differ up to a factor of two for certain areas. The overall European ammonia emissions are decreasing as a result of regulation related to the National Emission Ceiling Directive (NEC) and the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) directive, regulation that has been implemented in national legislation in the single European countries.

Recent {{research has shown that}} these monolith blocks can also be applied in the process and fine chemical industry as a possible replacement for existing powdered catalysts in e. g. stirred tank reactors. In this research the feasibility of a monolith stirred reactor (MSR) was investigated with LDA measurements on the flow field around and through monoliths (i) in a uniform flow field and (ii) as impeller blades in a stirred tank. Both;the flow fields around monoliths in a uniform flow fleld and in a stirred tank are found to depend on the cylinder used, blocked or monolith, as weU as on the monolith channel diameter and the speed of the flow fleld. Downstream of the obstacle, two distinct flow regimes are possible: (i) flow towards the cylinder for blocked cylinders or monoliths at low flow rates or low speeds of rotation and (ii) flow away from the cylinder for monoliths at higher flow rates or higher speeds of rotation. The wake behind the impeller blade travels out- and downward for increasing distances behind the impeller blade, until it dissipates before the next blade passage. For sufficient flow through the channels the turbulent kinetic energy levels directly behind the monohth impeller are reduced drastically. Through measurements on the monolith surface, with a tilted probe set-up, the flow through the monolith channels has been obtained. For a given monolith channel diameter, the channel velocity is approximately proportional to the speed of rotation. For increasing channel diameters the velocity increases, but the increase is less than proportional to the channel diameter. The results of a model for predicting these channel velocities, are in agreement with the measurements. A model chemical reaction inside the MSR has been used to estimate the efliciency of an MSR. Decreasing the channel diameter from 3 to 1 mm always yields an enhanced efficiency, while increasing the speed of rotation has a diminishing effect on the efliciency, depending on the reaction rate. The model can be used to flnd the appropriate speed of rotation, where a substantial improvement in efficiency is stiff reached. Kramers Laboratorium voor Fysische TechnologieApplied Science...|$|R

This {{study was designed to}} attempt to investigate these goals. For diesel engine vehicles, this can be achieved by improving the efficiency of the fuel combustion in the combustion chamber. By having a suitable oxidation catalyst in the fuel one would expect the efficiency of the fuel combustion to be increased and fewer partial oxidation products to be formed. Also by placing a <b>catalyst</b> <b>converter</b> in the exhaust system partial oxidation products may be converted to more desirable final products. Finally, in this research the net catalytic effect of using an additive treated fuel and a blank ceramic monolith to trap the metal in the exhaust gases for potential use as catalytic converter was investigated.

40|$|The {{increase}} of the worldwide demand of “Platinum group elements” (PGE) for application in several fields such as industry, medicine, jewellery and, especially, in <b>catalyst</b> <b>converter</b> production, caused a noticeable increasing of PGE concentration in the environment. Though palladium, among the anthropogenic PGE, {{is not the most}} abundant one, it is the most hazardous since it undergoes easily and quickly oxidation to palladium(II) when in contact with soils, with a consequent {{increase of}} its mobility in the environment. The presence of complexing agents, which form soluble complex species with palladium(II), favours the mobility of the ion with an increase of its availability to plants, animals and humans. Among anthropogenic complexing molecules, an important role is played by synthetic aminopolycarboxylic chelating agents (usually called with the acronym APC) whose concentration in the environment is progressively increasing owing to their considerable use in several fields (agriculture, industry, medicine) and a low biodegradability of most of them. The interaction of these ligands with palladium(II) ion leads to the formation of soluble complex species whose stability influences strongly the availability of palladium(II) in the environment. With the aim to assess the strength of interaction of Pd 2 + with aminopolycarboxylic ligands, here we report the results of a systematic study,, on the formation of palladium(II) complex species with five APCs [ethylenediamine-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetate (EDTA), (S,S) -Ethylenediamine-N,N′-disuccinic acid (S,S-EDDS), Nitrilotriacetate (NTA) and diethylenetriamine-N,N,N’,N’’,N’’-pentaacetate (DTPA) and triethylenetetraamine-N,N,N’,N’’,N’’’,N’’’-hexaacetate (TTHA) ]. Owing to the high stability of the Pd 2 + - APC complex species, the calculation of their stability constants was very difficult and was possible only by combining the results obtained from two series of ISE-H+ potentiometric titration (in NaNO 3 and in mixed NaNO 3 /NaI ionic medium) and from ISE-H+ potentiometric /spectrophotometric titrations (in NaClO 4). As expected, the stability of Pd-APC complex species is function of the number of carboxylic and amino groups present in the ligand molecules (e. g., logKPd(APC) = 37. 00, 36. 31, 23. 60, 23. 07 and 17. 82 for TTHA, DTPA, EDTA, S,S-EDDS and NTA in Na+ ionic media, at I = 0. 1 mol L- 1 and T = 25 °C).

40|$|Bad {{air quality}} is an {{increasing}} problem in most European countries {{and also in the}} Netherlands. A growing awareness of the effects of bad air quality on the environment and health has put the air quality issue high on the political agenda. Road traffic {{is one of the major}} air polluters in Europe. Especially near main arteries and in dense areas European air quality standards are being transgressed due to the presence of lively and much road traffic. Especially excessive concentrations of Nitro Oxides (NOx) and Particulate IVIatter (PM) cause problems. Dynamic Traffic Management (DTM) is often mentioned as one of the possibilities to reduce the polluting character of road traffic. These observations lead to the main research question for this study: To what extend can DTM measures contribute to an improvement of air quality? The goal set for this study is to investigate the possibilities to calculate the effects of DTM measures on air quality using microscopic traffic modelling. A calculation model can then be used to answer the main research question. Polluting character of road traffic Initially the characteristics of road traffic are investigated that cause its polluting character. Here fore, road traffic characteristics are subdivided into two groups: vehicle characteristics and operational characteristics. Literature study has lead to the conclusion that both vehicle characteristics and operational characteristics contribute significantly to the polluting character of road traffic. Vehicle characteristics that increase the polluting character are: Large vehicle weights, large engine sizes, diesel engines (PM and NOx), old vehicles (outdated environmental class) and poor vehicle maintenance. Furthermore the use of exhaust after treatment devices (<b>catalyst</b> <b>converter</b> and soot filter) has a large reducing effect off vehicle emissions. Operational characteristics that increase the polluting character are: highly dynamic driving with many acceleration and deceleration activities (transient state driving), extreme high and extreme low average speeds and many stops. Driving profile description In order to be able to investigate the quantitative impact of driving profile differences on emission rates, a driving profile should be described by characteristics that can be quantified. Each describing characteristic should comply with two boundary conditions; it should have a direct relation with emission rates and it should be measurable or calculable from a microscopic traffic model. All mechanical characteristics of vehicle operation lil<e engine speed and throttle position can therefore not be included. The following 8 characteristics have been selected: Average speed, speed deviation, average acceleration rate, number of stops per minute and the four driving mode proportions (acceleration time, deceleration time, constant speed time and idling time). Measured driving profiles and emission rates from the German HBEFA model have indicated the direct relations of the characteristics with vehicle emission rates. State of the art emission modelling Literature study of emission modelling in Europe has resulted in an overview of state of the art emission models that nowadays are used for emission calculations. The Dutch traffic situation model VERSIT+ is assessed as one of the best state of the art emission models at this moment. This model uses an extensive set of parameters to describe a driving profile. Multiple regression (using an extensive database of measured driving profiles) is use d to determine the emission rates that match a driving profile. Microscopic traffic modelling and emission calculation The microscopic traffic model VISSIM is used as tool to assess the effects of DTM measures in a case study. VISSIM was developed as a simulation tool for capacity and travel time calculations. The experience with VISSIM in accurate emission modelling is few. The value of driving profiles that are generated during a VISSIM simulation is uncertain. However, for this study, the VISSIM model is the only model available. The effect of DTM measures on vehicle emissions In order to select DTM measures that have the maximal positive effect on vehicle emissions, initially a short list is made of all DTM measures stated in the "Handbook for sustainable traffic management" (Rijkswaterstaat, 2003). This short list has been assessed using the knowledge from previous literature studies. The impact of the DTM measures has been assessed based on the expected impact on the 8 characteristics of a driving profile. Two DTM measured have been selected because their effects on driving profiles are considered to be very positive: Coordinated control and Truck priority. Case study The two DTM measures have been translated into 5 simulation scenarios for testing in a VISSIM environment. The selected case study is the ring road of Almere; this is a urban string or 14 controlled intersections. The 5 DTM scenarios are compared with a Reference Situation for which no special DTM measures are implemented. The 5 DTM scenarios are: 9 ̆ 5 Coordinated Control, in the main directions all intersection controllers interchange information 9 ̆ 5 on approaching vehicle platoons. 9 ̆ 5 Truck Priority, in the main directions all intersection controllers detect trucks at long distances 9 ̆ 5 in order to guarantee a delay less intersection crossing 9 ̆ 5 Truck Advantage, in the main directions green times are extended when a truck is detected 9 ̆ 5 within the detection field at distance from the intersection. 9 ̆ 5 Coordinated control with Truck priority, a combination. 9 ̆ 5 Coordinated control with Truck advantage, a combination. Considering the driving profile characteristics from Personal Cars (PC) and Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDV) that were recorded from the simulations, the coordinated control with truck priority alternative shows the best improvements w. r. t. the reference situation. Although mainly the driving profiles of traffic on the ring road (main directions) improve, also the entire network performance increases. However, maximum stopped delay times on the side roads frequently exceed the 90 second limit. In general, a DTM measure is able to reduce vehicle emission rates. The question "to what extend" can not be answered accurately based on the used calculation and simulation models. Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

They have similar physical and chemical properties, and tend to occur {{together in the same}} mineral deposits. Their properties are resistance to chemical corrosion over a wide temperature range, high melting point, high mechanical strength and good ductility, as well as outstanding catalytic properties, being therefore critical in many emerging technologies. Although natural environmental concentrations of PGEs are extremely low – generally at or below the ng/g –, levels of Pt, Pd and Rh are increasing, mainly because of their use in catalytic converters of motor vehicles (Zereini et al., 2007). The automobile <b>catalysts</b> <b>converters</b> use noble metals as active components, and were developed with the aim of reducing emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides (Sures et al., 2005). Since the beginning of the 1980 s, the PGEs represent a relatively new category of trace metals in the environment, especially in relation to automobile traffic (Haus et al., 2007). The PGEs of automobile catalytic converters are eroded {{from the surface of the}} catalyst and subsequently emitted in metallic form or as oxides (Turner and Price, 2008). The PGEs are subject to various physical and chemical transformations after deposition, and can potentially result in migration into environmental compartments (Moldovan et al., 2001; Vaughan and Florence, 1992). The concentration of PGEs has much increased in traffic exposed environmental samples (Lesniewska et al., 2004; Ely et al., 2001; Zereini et al., 2001; Schäfer et al., 1999; Fritsche and Meisel, 2004). However, what constituted a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions has resulted in increased levels of PGEs in the environment as shown in some studies in the dust of the road, roadsides, river sediments, sewage, soil and marine ecosystems (Ravindra et al., 2004). As a consequence of the growing use of PGEs, concentrations of these noble metals are rising clearly in different environmental matrices, mainly as road dusts, soils along heavily frequented roads, sewage sludge and sediments of urban rivers and harbour basins (Zimmermann and Sures, 2004). Currently, these emissions continue to grow. From the places near to the emission points, such as roads and other traffic routes PGEs are introduced into aquatic habitats where they accumulate in sediments and marine organisms. Despite this growing interest as emerging contaminants in recent decades, few studies in this field have been reported. This is due to the specific analysis methods and with a very high limit of detection for the determination of traces of PGEs at the ultra-trace level (Alsenz et al., 2009). The work here presented is focused on the assessment of changes in concentration of the PGEs, especially platinum, introduced by humans and the impact of its use in catalytic converters. To this aim, time-series analysis (1991 - 2011) of Pt were performed in mussel samples (Mytilus galloprovinciales) collected in the Vigo Ria (NW Iberian Peninsula) within the Instituto Español de Oceanografía (IEO) Marine Pollution Monitoring Program. Mussels are ideal organisms for use as bio-indicators of water pollution because as filtering organisms tend to accumulate dissolved substances in the environment. Mussels are abundant in the study environment and may constitute an important food source for fish and other predators, allowing platinum to enter food chains. The determination of platinum was carried out by catalytic adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (Cobelo-García et al. 2014). The effects of PGE on the marine organisms have been investigated in several laboratory experiments but very limited field studies have been carried out. The uptake rate of the noble metals is dependent on various factors such as exposure concentration, exposure period, metal species and water chemistry (Zimmermann and Sures, 2004). The results of this work shows an increase of platinum concentrations in mussels in the recent year; accordingly, for the period between 1991 and 1999 the average concentration was 0. 396 ± 0. 103 ng/g, increasing to 0. 501 ± 0. 114 ng/g for mussels collected during the last decade (2000 - 2011), and were significantly different at the 95 % level. On the other hand, the yearly trend observed for the increase in the concentrations of Pt in the mussels samples are in agreement with the Pt demand in Europe for their use in catalytic converters and with the number of vehicles sold in Spain during this period...|$|R
40|$|Using complexing-agent {{assisted}} sol-gel routes, mixed Pd/ceria-alumina and Pd/terbia-ceria-alumina catalysts were prepared. The {{materials have}} been characterised {{by means of}} ICP-MS, TEM, EDX, XPS, XRD, BET, TPR, TPO and TPD. Catalytic testing {{was carried out in}} a temperature programmed mode as well as isothermally, using synthetic exhaust gas mixtures with different air-to-fuel ratios. The obtained results were compared with those of traditionally impregnated Pd/ceria-alumina and PtRh/ceria-alumina. Evaluating the catalysts potential as three-way converters, {{it has been shown that}} as a result of the sol-gel preparation chosen, highly homogeneous materials were produced. These had (i) much higher oxygen storage potential (especially at low temperatures, T ≈ 400 - 500 K), (ii) improved metal support interactions and (iii) lower CO and propane light-off temperatures (T 50 %(CO) ≈ 423 K, T 50 %(C 3 H 8) ≈ 593 K for R ≥ 1). Under fuel-rich conditions an improved low temperature NO activity was shown for the ceria-containing materials. This was attributed to a ceria-mediated redox mechanism and an improved Pd-ceria interaction for these sol-gel-derived samples. The addition of terbia was found to promote the catalysts propane activity, especially under fuel-rich conditions. The application of the different <b>catalysts</b> as three-way <b>converters</b> has been discussed, with special emphasis on their potential during the cold-start period. In a further set of catalytic experiments, using less complex gas mixtures, a more comprehensive view of the detailed Pd chemistry involved in these new three-way catalysts was obtained...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} heating a {{foam-based}} catalyst bed {{has been developed}} using silicon carbide as the catalyst support due to its readily accessible, high surface area that is oxidation-resistant and is electrically conductive. The foam support may be resistively heated by passing an electric current through it. This allows the catalyst bed to be heated directly, requiring less power to reach the desired temperature more quickly. Designed for heterogeneous catalysis, the method {{can be used by}} the petrochemical, chemical processing, and power-generating industries, as well as automotive catalytic <b>converters.</b> <b>Catalyst</b> beds must be heated to a light-off temperature before they catalyze the desired reactions. This typically is done by heating the assembly that contains the catalyst bed, which results in much of the power being wasted and/or lost to the surrounding environment. The catalyst bed is heated indirectly, thus requiring excessive power. With the electrically heated catalyst bed, virtually all of the power is used to heat the support, and only a small fraction is lost to the surroundings. Although the light-off temperature of most catalysts is only a few hundred degrees Celsius, the electrically heated foam is able to achieve temperatures of 1, 200 C. Lower temperatures are achievable by supplying less electrical power to the foam. Furthermore, because of the foam s open-cell structure, the catalyst can be applied either directly to the foam ligaments or {{in the form of a}} catalyst- containing washcoat. This innovation would be very useful for heterogeneous catalysis where elevated temperatures are needed to drive the reaction...|$|R

The company is called Planetary Resources and its founders include aerospace entrepreneurs Eric Anderson and Peter Diamandis. Advisers include film director and explorer James Cameron and investors include Google's chief executive Larry Page and its executive chairman Eric Schmidt. They also {{plan to create}} a fuel depot in space by 2020 by using water from asteroids, splitting it to liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen for rocket fuel. From there, it could be shipped to Earth orbit for refueling commercial satellites or spacecraft. [...] The plan has been met with skepticism by some scientists, who do not see it as cost-effective, even though platinum and gold are worth nearly £35 per gram (approximately $1,800 per troy ounce). Platinum and gold are raw materials traded on terrestrial markets, and {{it is impossible to}} predict what prices either will command at the point in the future when resources from asteroids become available. For example, platinum traditionally is very valuable due to its use in both industrial and jewelry applications, but should future technologies make the internal combustion engine obsolete, the demand for platinum's use as the <b>catalyst</b> in catalytic <b>converters</b> may well decline and decrease the metal's long term demand. The ongoing NASA mission OSIRIS-REx, which is planned to return just a minimum amount (60 g; two ounces) of material but could get up to 2 kg from an asteroid to Earth, will cost about US$1 billion.|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne of the {{engineering}} technologies {{that can be used}} to reduce air pollution is the use of catalytic converter mounted on vehicle gas exhaust duct. Unfortunately, these tools are very expensive in the market and not all motor vehicles use these technologis, because the catalyst was made from exoensive metals and rarely available in the market, such as: Palladium, Platinum and Rhodium. Besides, the catalyst is susceptible to premium fuel with low levels of lead (Pb) which results in the damage of the function of the catalyst due to blockage in the honeycomb Catalytic Converter. Therefore research needs to be done in the laboratory to test the other substrate materials as a catalyst, to study the ability of the catalyst in a catalytic converter to reduce exhaust emissions of Carbon Monoxide. This research will also study the performance capabilities and assess the effectiveness of Manganese-coated Copper catalysts which are designed in such a way to obtain the appropriate shape and type of Catalytic <b>Converter</b> <b>catalyst</b> and suitable for premium fuel motor vehicles. The result showed that (1) Catalytic Converter design and modification of catalytic materials can be an alternative to overcome the high air pollution problem from the transportation sector, esspecially particular Carbon Monoxide exhaust emissions from gasoline motors. (2) The use of Manganese-Coated Copper as a catalyst in the catalytic converter was significantly able to increase the reduction of Carbon Monoxide exhaust emissions. (3) The increase of catalyst cells amount decreased the concentration of Carbon Monoxide exhaust emissions.

30|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) is {{a poisonous}} gas {{that needs to}} be removed from the air. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless and non-irritating gas, which makes it very difficult for humans to detect. Huge amounts of CO are emitted in the world, mainly from transportation, power plants, industrial and domestic activities [1, 2]. The transportation sector contributes the largest source of CO emissions in the developed countries. In comparison to a diesel engine, the petrol engine vehicle produces more CO into the environment [3, 4]. CO is formed in an internal combustion (I.C.) engine that is operated by the burning of fossil fuels (petrol or diesel), as an intermediate reaction during the incomplete combustion of HC [5]. The low temperature catalytic oxidation of CO is a very important process and it is essential in many applications such as in residential and automotive air-cleaning technologies, CO detectors, gas masks for firefighters, mining application and selective oxidation of CO in reformer gas for the fuel cell applications [6, 7]. The performance of catalytic converter is highly dependent upon the type of catalyst was used. In the presence of a catalyst, the rate of chemical reaction is increase; it acts like an agent that reduces the activation energy of the reactions [8]. The noble metals (Pt, Pd, Rh, Au, etc.) and base metals (Cu, Mn, Cr, Co, Ni, Fe, etc.) were widely used as catalysts in the catalytic converter [9, 10]. Commercial catalysts that were mainly applied for CO oxidation present in the exhaust gas were noble metals. It has a high activity and thermal stability, so it was widely used as a <b>catalyst</b> in catalytic <b>converter</b> [11]. However, the employment of noble metal catalysts was limited due to their low availability, sulfur poisoning, and high cost [12]. Therefore, it was important to find an alternative catalytic component to replace the noble metal catalyst and attention has been given to base metals as catalysts.|$|R
40|$|Platinum group {{elements}} (PGEs) {{are increasingly}} being used {{in a variety of}} environmentally-related technologies such as <b>catalysts</b> and catalytic <b>converters</b> which have strong expected growth to meet environmental and technological challenges this century. The platinum industry is actively seeking to progress its commitment to sustainability principles by reducing the negative impacts of their mining and mineral processing operations. Technical innovation to improve future plant designs, as well as the development of management policies, guidelines and protocols for efficient operation of process plants has therefore become a strategic priority for the South African platinum industry. The industry has also made an effort to understand the environmental impacts of its products from mine to metal, using life cycle methods. However, very limited research has been done to investigate what environmental value could be created if strategic and design decisions in minerals processing were life cycle based, particularly in the context of PGMs. Seminal work by Stewart (1999) investigating the environmental life cycle consideration for design-related decision making in the minerals industry has not led to significant adoption. Forbes et al. (2000) analysed metal processing using LCA and were able to identify opportunities for improved environmental performance. They however did not explore how it would be incorporated into the decision making cycle. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to determine whether life cycle assessment could help inform design decision making in the minerals industry. In the years 2002 - 2008 several PGM-producing companies commissioned new SO₂ scrubbing technologies to meet the regulations that had been set to prevent the release of excessive amounts of sulphur dioxide from smelters in the Rustenburg area, a mining town located in the North West Province of South Africa. Using these cleanup process retrofits as case studies, this dissertation aims to determine whether the introduction of LCA as an environmental analysis tool would have provided additional value to the decision makers. The case study approach that was chosen compared and assessed the performance of SO₂ abatement technologies and the effect of efficiencies chosen on environmental performance by using life cycle assessment modelling. By doing the life cycle assessment on the different options that the companies had, it was possible to evaluate the indirect environmental impacts that could have been overlooked during the design decision making process. In addition, experts {{who were involved in the}} design processes of the SO₂ abatement retrofits were interviewed to establish: i) how the design decisions were made and ii) whether the life cycle based insights into technology performance would have been of use in the design work. The goal of the life cycle assessment was to identify whether there were design decisions that induced environmental burden shifting when platinum smelters in the Rustenburg area added SO₂ abatement technologies to their processes, which could have been avoided had the LCA perspective been taken into account. The assessments considered two key variables, namely extent of recovery and technology choice...|$|R
