5|$|Most of the {{characters}} are fully aware of Veridian's nature, and often try to manipulate the system {{in order to stop}} bad things from happening to them (and sometimes to mitigate the evil effects of some of Veridian's projects). They are also all susceptible to the potential rewards the company can offer despite the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions,</b> such as the company's attempt to hire Lem's mother, or the company's introduction of scented light bulbs with known flaws. Much of the comedy of the show comes from {{the characters}}' navigation of these morally ambiguous areas.|$|E
5|$|Use of {{insanity}} {{as a concept}} dates from 1324, and its criminal application was used until the late 16th century in an almost identical way. The defence, if successful, either allowed the defendant to return home or led to him being incarcerated until he was granted a royal pardon; after 1542, a defendant who became insane prior to the trial could not be tried for any crime, {{up to and including}} high treason. During the 18th century the test to determine insanity became extremely narrow, with defendants required to prove that they could not distinguish between good and evil and that they suffered from a mental disease which made them incapable of understanding the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions.</b> The current wording comes from the M'Naghten Rules, based on the trial of Daniel M'Naghten in 1843.|$|E

40|$|Argumentation should {{encourage}} autonomous decision-making. Rick Santorum’s political campaign ad Welcome to Obamaville violates this requirement by deploying {{a flood of}} subliminal images.

25|$|Each episode also {{amounts to}} a {{confidence}} game played upon the viewers {{through the use of}} misdirection and hidden plot details that are revealed {{at the end of the}} story. Not all cons depicted are successful, and some episodes focus on the characters dealing with the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions.</b> However, even if a con does fail, main characters usually come out on top in some way or other...or, at times, nothing is gained but nothing lost, either.|$|E
25|$|Something of Hampden's fame {{no doubt}} is {{owing to the}} {{position}} which he took up as the opponent of ship money. But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others {{as far as possible}} from the evil <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions.</b> Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.|$|E
50|$|Incapacitation is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} a subset of specific deterrence. Incapacitation aims to prevent future crimes not by rehabilitating the individual but rather from taking away his ability to commit such acts. Under this theory, criminals are put in jail not so that they will learn the <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions</b> but rather so that while they are there, they will be unable to engage in crime.|$|R
5000|$|Sheila (Jennica Garcia), {{along with}} her friends, decided to camp in a {{seemingly}} desolated forest. To everyone's surprise, the others destroyed the anthills found on the camping site. Unknown to them, the anthills were the lairs of vicious dwarf-like creatures, the [...] "Lamang Lupa", and as a <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions,</b> they were hunted down one by one. They must escape the camping site immediately before the Lamang Lupa massacres them all.|$|R
60|$|At twelve o'clock {{the assault}} slackened. The {{soldiers}} had long left and, {{so far as}} could {{be seen from the}} roof of the house, had entirely evacuated the town; and as this fact became known to the mob, the thought <b>of</b> the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>action</b> cooled <b>their</b> fury; for they knew that, probably, the troops would land from the British ships next day. Each man had his plunder to secure, and gradually the crowd melted away.|$|R
25|$|Inhibition {{conflict}} is a cognitive function that arises in people and {{allows them to}} {{make decisions based on}} immediate stimuli and stimuli that require a higher level of processing. In sober individuals, situations that produce an inhibition conflict would consist of one set of salient cues (external stimuli) that stimulate a certain response and other cues (internal stimuli such as possible negative consequences or societal standards and norms) that would inhibit the salient cues and therefore prevent rash action. Those influenced by alcohol myopia are unable to comprehend this second set of cues, as the condition narrows an individual’s ability for higher-level cognitive functioning. Therefore, these individuals tend to act rashly without consideration for the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{role-playing}} games allow {{players to}} play as an evil character. Although robbing and murdering indiscriminately may {{make it easier to}} get money, there are usually consequences in that other characters will become uncooperative or even hostile towards the player. Thus, these games allow players to make moral choices, but force players to live with the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions.</b> Games often let the player control an entire party of characters. However, if winning is contingent upon the survival of a single character, then that character effectively becomes the player's avatar. An example of this would be in Baldur's Gate, where if the character created by the player dies, the game ends and a previous save needs to be loaded.|$|E
25|$|While trolls {{believe that}} they do not face {{consequences}} and can troll others on the Internet without repercussions, in the 2000s, due to high-profile cases where cyberbullies have allegedly been factors in suicides attributed to bullying, more laws have been put in place by governments. Trolls can face going to prison for certain actions that they take on the Internet, such as spreading hate speech such as racist messages. One of the highest profile cases is racist trolling. Racist trolling has seen individuals been sent to prison for Tweets they have sent that to them may have seemed harmless and not racist. One case of this in recent years is Liam Stacey who was jailed for fifty-six days for tweeting offensive messages such as 'Muamba is dead, hahahaha', referring to when footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed during a professional football game for Bolton Wanders (Williams, 2012). This highlights how offensive tweets and messages sent on any social networking platform does have repercussions for individuals {{and they have to be}} aware that they have to face the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E
50|$|James M. McPherson {{suggested}} in Battle Cry of Freedom that the “Fire-eater” program of {{breaking up the}} convention and running a rival ticket was deliberately intended {{to bring about the}} election of a Republican as President, and thus trigger secession declarations by the slave-owning states. Whatever the “intent” of the fire-eaters may have been, doubtless many of them favored secession, and the logical, probable, and actual <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions</b> was to fragment the Democratic party and thereby virtually ensure a Republican victory.|$|R
50|$|United States v. Riggs {{occurred}} during 1990. At the time, {{computers and the}} Internet were not uncommon in businesses and academic institutions, but not yet commonplace in American homes. Several computer break-ins in 1983 had been associated with teenagers in Wisconsin. These teenagers gained notoriety and became known as The 414s. High-profile public incidents perpetrated by groups such as The 414s combined with movies such as WarGames to create a public stereotype of hackers as wayward youths eager to abuse computer knowledge {{without regard to the}} <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Oblique intent: {{a person}} has oblique intent when the event is a natural <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> a {{voluntary}} act and they foresee it as such. The 'natural consequence' definition was replaced in R v Woollin with the 'virtually certain' test. A person is now held to intend a consequence (obliquely) when that consequence is a virtually certain <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>action,</b> and they knew {{it to be a}} virtually certain consequence. The first leg of this test has been condemned as unnecessary: a person should be held as intending a consequence if (s)he believed it to be a virtually certain <b>consequence,</b> regardless <b>of</b> whether it was in fact virtually certain.|$|R

[...] According to Burleigh, scientists are not abstract researchers; there are [...] "real world" [...] <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions,</b> and he [...] "shall not shed any tears whenever one of these [...] scientists encounters one of the unforgiving men on motorbikes ...

500|$|In Stage one (obedience and {{punishment}} driven), individuals {{focus on the}} direct <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions</b> on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. [...] "The last time I did that I got spanked, so I will not do it again." [...] The worse the punishment for the act is, the more [...] "bad" [...] the act is perceived to be. This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is [...] "egocentric", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own. There is [...] "deference to superior power or prestige".|$|E
500|$|According to Chris Cowley, Brady regretted Hindley's {{imprisonment}} and the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions,</b> but {{not necessarily}} the crimes themselves. He saw no point in making any kind of public apology; instead, he [...] "expresse remorse through actions". Twenty years of transcribing classical texts into Braille {{came to an end}} when the authorities confiscated his translation machine, for fear it might be used as a weapon. He once offered to donate one of his kidneys to [...] "someone, anyone who needed one", but was blocked from doing so. According to Colin Wilson, [...] "it was because these attempts to express remorse were thrown back at him that he began to contemplate suicide". He might have achieved this in 2006, when a female friend sent him 50paracetamol pills, stored in two Smarties tubes hidden inside a hollowed-out crime novel. The potentially lethal dose of tablets was intercepted.|$|E

Although Beiste's physical appearance {{was used as}} comedy in the episode, Jones was not offended; she called it hysterical, said [...] "it serves a purpose for the message" [...] and hoped [...] "maybe it will make people think outside of the show." [...] Murphy intended her storyline to highlight the fact that bullying can be damaging without necessarily being overt. He stated: [...] "Th episode is completely about accountability.

500|$|Garriott {{introduced}} {{a system of}} chivalry and code of conduct in [...] (1985) that persisted throughout later Ultimas. The player's Avatar tackles such problems as fundamentalism, racism and xenophobia, and based {{on his or her}} actions is tested periodically in ways that are sometimes obvious and sometimes unseen. This code of conduct was in part a response to the efforts among some Christian groups to mitigate the rising popularity of Dungeons & Dragons. Continuing until [...] (1999), it covered a range of virtues that included compassion, justice, humility and honor. This system of morals and ethics was unique at the time, as other video games allowed players to be lauded as [...] "heroes" [...] by the game worlds' denizens, no matter what the player's actions had been. In Ultima IV, on the other hand, players were forced to consider the moral <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions.</b> According to Garriott, Ultima was now [...] "more than a mere fantasy escape. It provided a world with a framework of deeper meaning a level of detail diversity of interaction that is rarely attempted." [...] "I thought people might completely reject this game because some folks play just to kill, kill, kill. To succeed in this game, you had to radically change the way you'd ever played a game before." ...|$|E

Not wanting to admit they were conned, Homer and Bart go along with Marge's theory. At the trial, the Blue Haired Lawyer leads Homer {{to say that it}} was Willie who stole the car. After Willie is proven guilty, he snatches Wiggum's gun and shoots Principal Skinner. At this point Homer finally confesses that he got conned but Marge and the townspeople themselves tell Homer and Bart that they set up the trial and the carjacking to teach them a lesson on conning people, revealing that Skinner was not really shot (it was a fake blood pack), the judge was Grampa wearing a latex mask, and the con man who stole their car was an actor called Devon Bradley. As Lisa is ready to explain why the town, media and police officials had [...] "nothing better to do" [...] than show them the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions,</b> Otto runs through the courtroom doors, shouting, 'Surf's Up!'.

40|$|Today, most {{cultural}} {{training is}} based on or built around "cultural engagements" or discrete interactions between the individual learner and one or more cultural "others". Often, success in the engagement is the end or the objective. In reality, these interactions usually involve secondary and tertiary effects with potentially wide ranging consequences. The concern is that learning culture within a strict engagement context might lead to "checklist" cultural thinking that will not empower learners to understand the full <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions.</b> We propose the use of agent based modeling (ABM) to collect, store, and, simulating the effects of social networks, promulgate engagement effects over time, distance, and consequence.

50|$|The game elides {{the more}} {{granular}} aspects of combat simulation, instead taking a heavily player-facing approach. Harm generally befalls the players as a <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions,</b> and little space is given for NPCs to take mechanical initiative. As such NPCs {{do not require}} significant stat blocks and {{there is very little}} dice rolling {{on the part of the}} game master. With no strict distinction between combat or any other task, all difficulty is largely handled in terms of the effect levels determined by the fictional position of the obstacle and players, whether outnumbered or outclassed. Complexity is provided in negotiating the choice of an action to perform, the security of the position that roll has, and the special factors, such as weapon or tool quality, which the player can leverage in the task.|$|R

40|$|Individual {{criminal}} responsibility, {{and command}} responsibility in particular, are important because, to deter human rights abuses, potential perpetrators must perceive prosecution {{as a possible}} <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>actions.</b> Historically, the doctrine of command responsibility {{has been an important}} tool to hold accountable leaders who plan, participate in, or acquiesce in large-scale human rights abuses.
