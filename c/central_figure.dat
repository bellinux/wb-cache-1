5|$|Above the <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> shines {{a single}} small star {{at the very}} top of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of the <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the <b>central</b> <b>figure,</b> and the fact that it is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Altar 4 is a {{circular}} monument. It {{was also found}} {{in the northern part of}} the East Plaza and was associated with Stela 4. It depicts three seated prisoners, the <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> is facing to the left while the other two are facing inwards towards him. Hieroglyphic texts are carved underneath the prisoners and upon the sides of the altar. The altar has been dated on stylistic grounds to the latter part of the 8th century AD.|$|E
5|$|Bonds led a {{controversial}} career, notably as a <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in baseball's steroids scandal. In 2007, he was indicted {{on charges of}} perjury {{and obstruction of justice}} for allegedly lying to the grand jury during the federal government's investigation of BALCO. The perjury charges against Bonds were dropped and an initial obstruction of justice conviction was overturned in 2015.|$|E
40|$|The {{presentation}} of the heroes and heroines in Ibsen's early, middle and later plays is undeniably different. In the early plays, the <b>central</b> <b>figures,</b> as represented by Brand and Peer Gynt, stand as super human beings who in following their extreme desires perform all the incredible deeds in their own imaginative worlds. In the middle plays, the <b>central</b> <b>figures,</b> as represented by Nora, Mrs. Alving and Dr. Stockrnann are the midelle class people who struggle against the false values of society for truth and freedom. And in the later plays, the <b>central</b> <b>figures,</b> as represented by Solness, Borkman and Rubek, are mystical frustrated <b>central</b> <b>figures,</b> who gain triumph over their wasted lives through their death. However, beyond all the differences there is one characteristic that makes all Ibsen's <b>central</b> <b>figures</b> similar to one another. The similarity that unites all these <b>central</b> <b>figures</b> {{is that all of}} them stand as individuals...|$|R

5|$|Disney {{remains the}} <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> {{in the history}} of animation. Through {{technological}} innovations and alliances with governments and corporations, he transformed a minor studio in a marginal form of communication into a multinational leisure industry giant. Despite his critics, his vision of a modern, corporate utopia as an extension of traditional American values has possibly gained greater currency in the years after his death.|$|E
5|$|Edward III died in 1377 and was {{succeeded by}} his ten-year-old grandson, Richard II. At Richard's coronation, Suffolk carried the new king's sceptre, {{and he was}} later {{appointed}} to Richard's minority council. Even after the council was disbanded in January 1380, he remained a <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> at court, participating in the negotiations for the king's marriage to Anne of Bohemia, and mediating in a conflict between John of Gaunt and Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Providence College {{was founded}} as an all-male school {{through the efforts}} of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence and the Dominican Province of St. Joseph.

5|$|Structure 5D-82 is {{the northernmost}} {{structure}} adjoining the East Platform. The {{first version of}} this building {{was built in the}} 4th century AD. This early version was a semicircular platform supporting a building that possessed a single chamber. This building was decorated with an elaborate stucco frieze decorated with anthropomorphic figures and glyphs. The <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in the frieze is believed by archaeologists to represent the deity Itzamna.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} natural philosopher, a forerunner {{of the modern}} scientist, recreating one of Robert Boyle's air pump experiments, in which a bird is deprived of air, before a varied group of onlookers. The group exhibits a variety of reactions, {{but for most of}} the audience scientific curiosity overcomes concern for the bird. The <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> looks out of the picture as if inviting the viewer's participation in the outcome.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}}'s {{main focus}} {{is the death}} scene of the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Ulrich von Jungingen; another <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> is the Lithuanian duke Vytautas (Witold), dressed in red with a raised sword. The painting has been both hailed and criticized for its complexity. It is one of Matejko's most recognizable works, and has likely contributed to the popular image {{of the battle of}} Grunwald, and its enduring fame in Polish consciousness.|$|E

5|$|The {{pictorial}} {{composition of}} the painting is constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on {{the left of the}} canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> waves desperately at a rescue ship.|$|E

5|$|A semi-legendary figure, Laozi {{was usually}} {{portrayed as a}} 6th-centuryBCE {{contemporary}} of Confucius, but most modern historians consider him, assuming he existed, to have lived during the Warring States period of the 5th or 4thcenturyBCE. A <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in Chinese culture, Laozi is claimed by both the emperors of the Tang dynasty and modern people of the Li surname as a founder of their lineage. Laozi's work has been embraced by both various anti-authoritarian movements as well as Chinese Legalism.|$|E

5|$|Arthur is a <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in {{the legends}} {{making up the}} Matter of Britain. The legendary Arthur {{developed}} as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn. How much of Geoffrey's Historia (completed in 1138) was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey himself, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Berndt Von Üxküll – Von Üxkül is a {{paraplegic}} junker from Pomerania and {{a composer}} {{who is married}} to Una. A World War I veteran, he fought alongside Aue's father in the Freikorps, whom he describes as a sadist. Despite essentially agreeing with their nationalist and antisemitic ideology, he distances himself from the Nazis. His name is possibly a reference to Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, an anti-Nazi resistant and uncle of Claus von Stauffenberg, a <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in the failed plot to assassinate Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Chancellor Law's Fountain – Unveiled in May 1871, the {{fountain}} was sculpted by Turner and Allen of London. The lions {{are made from}} Ashlar stone and the <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> is sculpted iron. The fountain {{was a gift from}} James Thomas Law who was the chancellor of the diocese and gave much to the city, including the statue of Samuel Johnson in the market square. The fountain is located at the centre of the Museum Gardens. In 2011 {{the fountain}} was restored with funding from Lichfield Conduit Lands Trust.|$|E

5|$|Film noir {{encompasses}} {{a range of}} plots: the <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> may be a private investigator (The Big Sleep), a plainclothes policeman (The Big Heat), an aging boxer (The Set-Up), a hapless grifter (Night and the City), a law-abiding citizen lured into {{a life of crime}} (Gun Crazy), or simply a victim of circumstance (D.O.A.). Although film noir was originally associated with American productions, films now so described have been made around the world. Many pictures released from the 1960s onward share attributes with film noir of the classical period, and often treat its conventions self-referentially. Some refer to such latter-day works as neo-noir. The clichés of film noir have inspired parody since the mid-1940s.|$|E
5|$|Inspection under {{infrared}} {{has revealed}} that the panels were heavily reworked during a number of revisions. The legs of the <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> are surrounded by small magenta horseshoe shapes, which infrared shows to have been first drafted as flowers. The area below the head is thickly coated with white and orange paint, while the inspection exposes a series of underlying curved brushstrokes used to compose a landscape, and a small distant reclining figure. When the canvas is unframed, a number of measuring marks are visible on the outer margin of board, indicating that the composition was carefully conceived.|$|E
5|$|Jesus is the <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> of Christianity. Although Christian {{views of}} Jesus vary, it is {{possible}} to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived from various sources, including the canonical gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline epistles and the Johannine writings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God. Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both major and minor differences on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.|$|E
