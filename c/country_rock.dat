Itchy Brother performed together until 1982, with James Harrison replacing Martin from 1973 to 1976. The Young brothers and Martin began performing as The Kentucky Headhunters in 1986, adding brothers Ricky Lee Phelps (lead vocals, harmonica) and Doug Phelps (bass guitar, backing vocals) to the membership.|$|E
5|$|Athens' local country {{scene has}} never been as {{significant}} as the profusion of indie rock bands; however, modern Athens rock takes many elements from the folk, bluegrass and country traditions, including such bands as the Normaltown Flyers. The band Drive-By Truckers, and the , have done much {{in recent years to}} make <b>country</b> <b>rock</b> a major part of Athens' musical identity. Recent bands such as The Broken String Band have emerged influenced by the folk rock genre. The rapper Bubba Sparxxx, originally from South Georgia, has also helped diversify Athens' country heritage, by adding a rural image and elements of country music to his Dirty South style of hip hop music.|$|E

40|$|Nd isotopic {{data from}} the South Mountain {{batholith}} show that its peraluminous granitic rocks have considerably higher [epsilon]tNd (t= 372 Ma) values (- 5. 2 to - 1. 4) than the extensive flyschoid <b>country</b> <b>rocks</b> (- 11. 2 to - 8. 7). These isotopic data are combined with Sr isotopic measurements to estimate {{the involvement of the}} <b>country</b> <b>rocks,</b> either as source materials or as contaminants, in the batholith. Metasedimentary enclaves in the batholith generally have Nd and Sr isotopic compositions intermediate between those of the batholith and the <b>country</b> <b>rocks,</b> and provide evidence of contamination by the <b>country</b> <b>rocks.</b> Integrated with other geochemical data, the isotopic results show at least two possible origins for the South Mountain batholith: either this large batholith is a hybrid of mantle and crustal materials and contains a large proportion of mantle-derived Nd and Sr, or the magma is derived from deeper metasedimentary crustal material, with younger model ages or higher Sm/Nd ratios than the upper crust...|$|R

5|$|Between 1967 and 1970, Bob Dylan {{recorded}} and released {{a series of}} albums that incorporated <b>country</b> <b>rock</b> elements. All were produced by Bob Johnston. During the sessions for the final of these, New Morning, Dylan decided {{that he did not}} want to continue working with Johnston. Al Kooper did uncredited production work to help Dylan finish the album. For his next recording session, Dylan asked Leon Russell, who made his name with Joe Cocker, to assist in finding a new sound. Russell suggested that Dylan come with him to Blue Rock Studios in New York City to record some new material.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, rock spawned several subgenres, {{beginning}} with surf. Surf was an instrumental guitar genre {{characterized by a}} distorted sound, associated with the Southern California surfing youth culture. Inspired by the lyrical focus of surf, The Beach Boys began recording in 1961 with an elaborate, pop-friendly, and harmonic sound. As their fame grew, The Beach Boys' songwriter Brian Wilson experimented with new studio techniques and became associated with the counterculture. The counterculture was a movement that embraced political activism, and was closely connected to the hippie subculture. The hippies were associated with folk rock, <b>country</b> <b>rock,</b> and psychedelic rock. Folk and <b>country</b> <b>rock</b> {{were associated with the}} rise of politicized folk music, led by Pete Seeger and others, especially at the Greenwich Village music scene in New York. Folk rock entered the mainstream {{in the middle of the}} 1960s, when the singer-songwriter Bob Dylan began his career. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes The Beatles' shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-1960s to Bob Dylan's influence at the time. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands and soft, folky singer-songwriters. Psychedelic rock was a hard-driving kind of guitar-based rock, closely associated with the city of San Francisco. Though Jefferson Airplane was the only local band to have a major national hit, the Grateful Dead, a country and bluegrass-flavored jam band, became an iconic part of the psychedelic counterculture, associated with hippies, LSD and other symbols of that era. Some say that the Grateful Dead were truly the most American patriotic rock band to have ever existed; forming and molding a culture that defines Americans today.|$|E
5|$|The early 1970s saw {{a wave of}} singer-songwriters {{who drew}} on the introspective, deeply {{emotional}} and personal lyrics of 1960s folk-rock. They included James Taylor, Carole King and others, all known just as much for their lyric ability as for their performances. The same period saw the rise of bluesy Southern rock and <b>country</b> <b>rock</b> groups like the Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. In the 1970s, soft rock developed, a kind of simple, unobtrusive and mellow form of pop-rock, exemplified {{by a number of}} bands like America and Bread, most of whom are little remembered today; many were one-hit wonders. In addition, harder arena rock bands like Chicago and Styx also saw some major success.|$|E

In the 1970s, {{he became a}} successful record producer for teen idols, including the Osmonds, Shaun Cassidy, and Leif Garrett. In 1986, he was music supervisor for the soundtrack of the film Dirty Dancing, and {{has been involved in}} several other movie soundtracks well into the 2000s. Shaun Harris collaborated with Lloyd to release Harris's self-titled debut solo album in 1973, which explored his <b>country</b> <b>rock</b> influences. Later on, he became the president of Barry Manilow's publishing company and most recently Harris has written a play about his life. Although Danny Harris was initially disillusioned with the music industry, he recorded the gospel album Thank Him Every Day in 1980. He also worked as a folk musician and actor before dying on the set of Saving Mr. Banks from a heart attack on October 1, 2012. Morgan helped found Three Dog Night (though left before they found commercial success) and joined the Electric Prunes for their album Just Good Old Rock and Roll. He died in 1989 aged 44.|$|E
5|$|The {{counterculture}} was a youth {{movement that}} included political activism, especially {{in opposition to}} the Vietnam War, and the promotion of various hippie ideals. The hippies were associated primarily with two kinds of music: the folk-rock and <b>country</b> <b>rock</b> of people like Bob Dylan and Gram Parsons, and the psychedelic rock of bands like Jefferson Airplane and The Doors. This movement was very closely connected to the British Invasion, a wave of bands from the United Kingdom who became popular throughout much of the 1960s. The British Invasion initially included bands like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and The Zombies who were later joined by bands like the Moody Blues and The Who. The sound of these bands was hard-edged rock, with the Beatles originally known for songs that resembled classic black rock songs by Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Smokey Robinson, The Shirelles and the Isley Brothers. Later, as the counterculture developed, The Beatles began using more advanced techniques and unusual instruments, such as the sitar, as well as more original lyrics.|$|E
40|$|Stable {{isotopes}} {{are useful}} tracers of fluid-rock interactions in contact aureole settings. To date, {{only a few}} case studies have used Li isotopes to study fluid-rock interactions in contact aureole settings. These studies highlight the very large Li isotopic fractionation that can be generated in these settings via diffusion of Li from the pluton into the <b>country</b> <b>rocks,</b> {{but none of these}} studies have generated a complete and detailed section of the contact aureole needed to understand the Li distributions. Here, I report the results from a combination of Li isotope analyses and 2 -D advection-diffusion modeling for two detailed profiles through <b>country</b> <b>rocks</b> adjacent to Li-rich pegmatite dikes in the Florence County pegmatite field. The results show that the Li concentration and isotopic distribution in the two contact profiles is consistent with fluid infiltration and diffusion of Li through a grain boundary fluid from the pegmatites into their <b>country</b> <b>rocks...</b>|$|R

25|$|Towards {{the close}} of Carboniferous Period some 295 million years ago (Ma), crustal {{extension}} caused by movement of the Earth’s tectonic plates allowed the emplacement of igneous intrusions of magma across much of northern England of a suite of tholeiitic dolerite intrusions.

30|$|An exposed {{cross section}} of the tilted Tottabetsu {{plutonic}} complex allows direct evaluation of its original 2 -D cross-sectional shape and pretilting vertical density variations in both the pluton and the <b>country</b> <b>rocks,</b> which serves as a strong constraint in gravity modeling that complements information on the ’missing’ pretilting horizontal dimension of this tilted pluton. The pluton is stratified with the uppermost thin granitic unit (≈ 1 -km thick) and the underlying thick gabbro-diorite units (≈ 9 -km thick) that preserve a stratigraphic record of numerous hotter replenishments in the form of alternation of originally horizontal mafic sheets and cumulate layers. Both the pluton and the <b>country</b> <b>rocks</b> show systematic density increase with pretilting crustal depth, but density contrast of the pluton with the <b>country</b> <b>rocks</b> varies between each unit. The 2 -D cross-sectional shape and gravity analysis revealed that the pluton had a vertically-elongated shape with vertical side walls before tilting. The vertical side walls, together with the stack of the originally horizontal sheets and cumulate layers, suggests that the pluton grew only vertically by piston mechanism. The very thick, exposed cross section provides unequivocal evidence for development of such a pluton with this unusual shape and mass distribution, which has been inferred elsewhere only by some geophysical studies.|$|R
