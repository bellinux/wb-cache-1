50|$|Nevado del Ruiz is one {{of several}} stratovolcanoes within Los Nevados National Natural Park, a {{national}} park located west of Bogotá in the centre of the Colombian Andes. The park is a popular tourist destination and contains several tourist shelters. The slopes of the volcano are used for winter sports, and nearby Lake Otún offers trout fishing. A number of commercially operated spas can be found nearby.In 1868-1869, German geologists Wilhelm Reiss and Alphons Stübel were the first to attempt to climb Ruiz.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a compact network called <b>CUNet</b> (compact {{unsupervised}} network) {{to counter the}} image classification challenge. Different from the traditional convolutional neural networks learning filters by the time-consuming stochastic gradient descent, <b>CUNet</b> learns the filter bank from diverse image patches with the simple K-means, which significantly avoids the requirement of scarce labeled training images, reduces the training consumption, and maintains the high discriminative ability. Besides, we propose a new pooling method named weighted pooling considering the different weight values of adjacent neurons, which helps to improve the robustness to small image distortions. In the output layer, <b>CUNet</b> integrates the feature maps gained in the last hidden layer, and straightforwardly computes histograms in non-overlapped blocks. To reduce feature redundancy, we implement the max-pooling operation on adjacent blocks to select the most competitive features. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art classification performances with <b>CUNet</b> on CIFAR- 10, STL- 10, MNIST and Caltech 101 benchmark datasets...|$|E
