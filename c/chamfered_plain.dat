60|$|So I shall {{call the}} above {{mouldings}} beaded chamfers, {{when there is}} any chance of confusion with the <b>plain</b> <b>chamfer,</b> a, or b, of Fig. LII.: and {{when there is no}} such chance, I shall use the word chamfer only.|$|R
50|$|Reputed to be {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} building in the village it was quite badly damaged in the plane crash which destroyed the Church in 1944. It's Grade II listing says - House. Late medieval and later. Eastern section rebuilt after 1945. Colour-washed brick and flint (rendered to road side) supporting a jettied timber framed first floor. Pantile roof. Section of jettied first floor elevated: believed to represent carriage entrance. 2 storeys with vaulted cellar to rear. Irregular fenestration with 2 3-light and 2 2-light modern mullion windows to ground floor street side and 3 3-light casements to upper floor. Upper floor close-studded to both sides. Irregular fenestration to rear with C18 and C19 casements and evidence for one C17 <b>plain</b> <b>chamfered</b> mullion window. 2 axial stacks and an C18 or C19 shallow pitched roof. Interior. Large <b>plain</b> <b>chamfered</b> spinal bridging joist with straight stops. Evidence for 2 opposing long windows. Moulded brick corbelling probably for a first floor fireplhce. Arched doorway with exposed medieval bricks.|$|R
6000|$|... § XIII. If we {{take the}} <b>plain</b> <b>chamfer,</b> b, of Fig. LII., on a large scale, as at a, Fig. LV., and bead both its edges, cutting away the parts there shaded, we shall have a form much used in richly {{decorated}} Gothic, both in England and Italy. It might be more simply described as the chamfer a of Fig. LII., with an incision on each edge; but the part here shaded is often worked into ornamental forms, not being entirely cut away.|$|R
2500|$|The {{church was}} {{enlarged}} {{by the addition}} of the nave arcades and aisles in the early or mid-13th century [...] The arches at [...] the western end of each arcade were added in the late 13th or early 14th century, those on the south being later. [...] The columns are octagonal with <b>plain</b> <b>chamfered</b> bases and moulded capitals. [...] There were originally deep solid responds at the eastern end of each arcade (altered to make a narrower additional arch in the 19th century). [...] There are now seven arches on each side.|$|R
40|$|Elastic stress {{concentration}} factors (SCFs) for internally pressurized thick cylindrical vessels with radial and offset circular and elliptical crossholes are presented. Three forms of intersection between the crosshole and main bore are considered: <b>plain,</b> <b>chamfered</b> and blend radiused. The minimum SCF {{was found to}} occur for the plain intersection configuration, with the peak stress at the crotch corner between the main bore and crosshole on the longitudinal plane of symmetry. Incorporating a chamfer or blend radius at the intersection reduces the {{stress concentration}} at the main bore but introduces higher peak stress elsewhere in the chamfer or blend region...|$|R
50|$|The gable is a {{projecting}} one extending further east {{than the}} wall below and the finish {{is also one}} of tile-hanging (matching that of the adjacent cottage). The tiles are clay and are decorative fish-scale type of probable 19th century origin. At the gable the cladding is embellished by pierced white painted timber barge-boards. A single two light casement window lights the interior of the garrets. The window has a moulded timber frame with a central mullion that is hollow-chamfered on the exterior and <b>plain</b> <b>chamfered</b> on the interior. The leaded lights have diamond quarrels and each light is side hung on pintles fixed to the timber frame.|$|R
40|$|A {{finite element}} {{investigation}} of the shakedown behaviour of thick cylindrical pressure vessels with crossholes subject to cycling internal pressure is presented. Radial and offset crossholes with circular and elliptical cross-sections are considered, with three types of intersection between the crosshole and main bore: <b>plain,</b> <b>chamfered</b> and blended. The {{results show that the}} crosshole significantly alters the shakedown behaviour of thick cylindrical vessels. The limit pressure is relatively unaffected, but the shakedown pressure decreases significantly. This increases the possibility of cyclic plasticity failure mechanisms in thick cylinders for a wider range of cylinder geometries. The form of the intersection between the crosshole and main bore does not significantly affect the shakedown behaviour...|$|R
50|$|The chancel is 15 ft {{long and}} 14 ft wide. The chancel arch {{dates to the}} 11th century and is the oldest part of the church still visible. The head is of two rings, with plaster or rubble filling. It has 14 small, {{variously}} sized voussoirs and has become slightly flattened {{as a result of}} subsidence with the jambs not quite vertical. The jambs are square-cut, each having five upright and flat slabs of similar heights, two per course. At the top of each upright, there is a 7 in <b>plain</b> <b>chamfered</b> impost. The arch is 6 ft to the imposts; it is 8 ft wide and11 ft to the crown. The jambs are 2 ft thick.|$|R
50|$|The Capt. Goodgame House is a {{historic}} house on Arkansas Highway 128 in Holly Springs, Arkansas. Built in 1918, this single story wood frame house is an unusual late and high quality example of a vernacular style of house architecture more typically seen in 19th century construction in the area. It has a gable roof, and is clad in novelty siding. A porch extends across the front facade, supported by <b>plain</b> <b>chamfered</b> posts. The gable ends of the roof are extended, with full pediments, and the door and window surrounds are more elaborate than are typically seen in the area. The interior of the house follows a standard central hall plan, but the detailing is again of a particularly high quality.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower is}} three storeys high {{and has two}} vaulted rooms in the basement. Similar to the towers of Alnwick and Morpeth, the Embleton tower has stone groining. Built as a {{rectangle}} with a high, <b>plain,</b> <b>chamfered</b> base, it measures 19 ft from east to west, and 40 ft from north to south. A chimney projects near {{the centre of the}} east wall. A three-light window and a small slit have been blocked up to the south side of it. There is a two-light window of the same type on the second floor. The roof rests on thin gables. It appears that the original roof was on a higher level than the present one. The embrasures are well proportioned. The tower probably had a spire made of wood and lead, similar to another at Ryton.|$|R
50|$|The West and North {{transept}} windows have a curvilinear design - as did {{the former}} south transept window - of 4 lights with cinquefoil over. The North aisle has two 3-light windows in brick while the South aisle has two 3-light windows in curvilinearstyle, all in <b>plain</b> <b>chamfered</b> surrounds. In the North chapel, there are two lancets to the west, and two paired lancets with quatrefoils over to east, while the chancel has a 3-light Perpendicular window and a 2-light curvilinear window on the south wall. The chancel east window is a 5-light perpendicular window, while the chapel east window is a 4-light perpendicular window. All of the windows possess the original reveals, as {{do all of the}} doors. The chancel south wall has two blocked window openings: the westernmost one is blocked by the stair turret while the easterly one is cut through by 14th century curvilinear window.|$|R
5000|$|Inside {{are visible}} the {{transverse}} and axial beams <b>plain</b> <b>chamfered</b> {{except in the}} service end with joists lathed and plastered to soffits. Grooves for sliding shutters. First floor is open {{from end to end}} and to collars. Posts are [...] with [...] tie-beams with arched braces. Plain crownposts have axial braces, much restored. Upstairs are two large rooms and the Hall {{has been used as a}} school and an almshouse, with inserted partitions and chimneys; most of these have been removed later. Morant wrote in 1768: [...] "A house, close to the church yard, said to be built by one Chimney, was designed for the entertainment of poor people on their wedding day". It seems to be very ancient, but ruinous', without supplying a Christian name or date. That its jutting façade faces away from the church tends to confirm this secular intention, for buildings of similar form designed as the meeting places of religious guilds would have a jutting midsection facing towards the church.|$|R
2500|$|Gill's Almshouses: A : 1842; Charles Lanyon, architect. The {{charitable}} endowment of Henry Gill who, {{dying in}} 1761, bequeathed [...] "to fourteen aged men, decayed in their circumstances, £10 each per annum and also houses and gardens", in Ellis Street (see No. 23a). Later this further block was built facing the harbour. The pretty Tudor revival style {{is reminiscent of}} contemporary churches and schools designed by the same architect, then County Surveyor of Antrim. The middle and wing bays of the symmetrical five-bay front project slightly and have tall double-shouldered gables with curious finials like inverted gate posts. Beneath the datestone the central front doorway has a four-centred arch, recessed surround, and a hood moulding with big cabbage-like bosses all dulled by dark paint. The intermediate bays have square windows with <b>plain</b> <b>chamfered</b> frames. Each wing bay has a triple window, the centre light taller than its neighbours, embraced by a label moulding which echoes the stepping of the gables. Single pointed lancets with mouldings akin to that {{on the front door}} light the gables. Above the steep tiled roof rise two chimneys with a pair of diagon¬ally set stacks apiece.|$|R
50|$|The {{house was}} built of local timbers - tallow wood (eucalyptus microcorys) for floor bearers, white beech (Gmelina leichhardtii) for floors, walls, and {{ceilings}} and red cedar (Toona australis) for joinery - {{thought to have been}} felled on the property or acquired from nearby, and pit-sawn and handcrafted to make boards. Bricks for steps and a fireplace were hand-made, probably from local clay. The core initially comprised a central hallway and 4 rooms - front parlour, front bedroom, rear dining room and rear bedroom. The latter was partitioned into two bedrooms at a some stage - some Burnett descendants believe it was always partitioned. A short time later two attic bedrooms were added. Early photographs of the house show external walls of deep boards and exposed timber stud framing, encircled by verandahs and resting on low stumps. The high-pitched shingled roof had a short ridge, and the verandah roofs, also shingled, were supported on <b>plain</b> <b>chamfered</b> timber posts. Glass and timber-panelled French doors opened onto the verandahs from all rooms. The first front steps were of timber, but had been replaced by 1907 with masonry steps. Between early 1907 and mid-1909, the verandah roofs were replaced with corrugated galvanised iron; later the whole roof was clad with iron. An external oven and chimney is shown in the earliest photograph, dated , but later a detached kitchen wing was built.|$|R

This is a good little build¬ing, adding much to the town's seafront, and worthy of careful renovation. Happily the James Butcher Housing Association is now undertaking this work.|$|R
