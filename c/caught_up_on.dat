After one of its Stuart tanks knocked out an anti-tank gun, B Squadron advanced through the German line, dislodging anti-tank guns and destroying a Sd.Kfz. 250 half-track. During the afternoon, C Squadron failed to break through the German centre but that night the Germans withdrew. On 16 January, the regiment advanced to high ground above the airstrip at Sedada, losing a tank and carrier. C Squadron advanced down the plateau in the darkness, losing a carrier to a mine on the trail. The regiment found an alternate route, ending the day in Wadi Merdum. On 18 January, Div Cav advanced through rugged country to Beni Ulid. The regiment advanced towards Tarhuna the following day, bivouacking halfway there, before discovering a route through the hills north of the road.|$|E

It was actually one of the first lifeboats to be lowered on Captain Smith's suggestion that passengers should be loaded from the Promenade Deck rather than the Boat Deck. However, the captain had forgotten that– unlike on his previous command, Titanics sister ship Olympic– the forward half of the Promenade Deck was enclosed. Lightoller ordered that the windows on the Promenade Deck's enclosure were to be opened, and moved on to deal with the other lifeboats. The windows proved unexpectedly difficult to open and to add to the problems, the lifeboat got <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Titanics sounding spar, which projected from the hull immediately below the boat. The spar had to be chopped off to allow the lifeboat to progress. A stack of deck chairs was used as a makeshift staircase to allow passengers to climb up and through the windows and into the boat.|$|E

Su Shi's poetry also was much affected by his second period of banishment to what was then an extremely remote imperial outpost on the far southern island of Hainan. During the Southern Song, much of the political controversy was waged around the issue of the status of the occupied northern part of the empire, which had been lost in the Jurchen invasion.

2500|$|The [...] "Imperial Eagle" [...] (Kenzo Suzuki) and the [...] "Italian Eagle" [...] (Marco Corleone) were {{accompanied}} by CMLL Luchadora Mima Shimoda to the right for the main event match. During the early parts of the match the crowd would actually cheer for the rudo team at times, especially Marco Corleone, choosing to side with him instead of the recently turned Universo 2000 and Shocker who had not done a lot to earn the crowd's respect {{leading up to the}} match. Shocker pinned Corleone after just over four minutes of wrestling, putting his team up by a point. The second fall is about the length of the first one, approximately four minutes and saw the rudo team of Corleone and Suzuki win after Corleone executed a [...] "Superman Flight", one of his signature high flying moves off the top rope, and pinned Unverso 2000. With the match tied the third fall, both teams took more chances, including Corleone getting <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the ropes during one of his leaps out of the ring. The match saw Universo 2000 pin Kenzo Suzuki, followed by Marco Corleone pinning Universo 2000, leaving only himself and Shocker as the legal men in the match. When the referee turned his back Universo 2000 landed a low-blow on Marco Corleone, making it easy for Shocker to pin him for the third and deciding fall. After the match both Corleone and Suzuki {{stood in the middle of}} the ring while the designated barber cut their hair off and then shaved them completely bald to fulfill the Luchas de Apuestas stipulation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the opening}} match second {{generation}} luchador Stigma. with his chest painted to resemble The Incredible Hulk, {{teamed up with}} the Distrito Federal Welterweight Championship Sensei {{to take on the}} rudo ("Bad guys") team of Bobby Zavala and Cholo. Stigma got the third and deciding fall for his team, in what was described as a [...] "memorable" [...] performance. The second match of the night was originally booked to have Mini-Estrella Astral team up Fantasy and Último Dragóncito, but on the prior Tuesday Astral got badly hurt during an Infierno en el Ring Steel cage match. Astral was the sixth person to exit the cage when he tried to perform a Moonsault of the top of the cage onto Mercurio, Aéreo and Fantasy who were on the floor. Due to the cage mesh breaking earlier in the match, Astral got <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the cage and landed awkwardly on the three men on the floor. The bad fall caused Astral to be rushed out of the arena for immediate attention and Mercurio had to be carried to the back as well due to the impact of Astral. Due to the injuries sustained he was replaced by Acero. The rudo team, , Pequeño Olímpico and Pierrothito, had all suffered various injuries during the same match but seemed to be okay on Friday night. The rudo trio consisted of the reigning CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion (Olímpico), the reigning Mexican National Lightweight Champion (Pierrothito) {{and one of the most}} experienced Mini-Estrellas in the division, an advantage that was evident as the team won both the first and the last fall of the match, taking the last fall by submission as Pierrothito forced Dragoncito to give up. The Lightning Match (10 minute time limit and only one fall as opposed to the traditional three fall matches CMLL prefers) featured the experienced rudo Sangre Azteca take on the high flying Fuego, who was one half of the CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship team with Stuka, Jr.. Neither wrestler dominated the match, but Sangre Azteca took the victory in five minutes, thirty seconds when he countered Fuego's move off the top rope with a dropkick followed by a pinfall. CMLL introduced Puma King as simply [...] "Puma" [...] during the fourth match, which may or may not be an indicator of a permanent name change. Puma teamed up with La Fievre Amarilla ("Yellow fever"), the team of Okumura and Namajague to take on Rey Cometa, Stuka, Jr. and Tritón. The match served as a continuation of the storyline between Puma and Rey Cometa, that had already seen Puma win a match to unmask Rey Cometa at the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show. The two kept the intensity up with Rey Cometa pinning Puma to win the first fall and Puma pinning Rey Cometa to win the second fall. In the third fall Okumura took advantage of a distracted referee to land an illegal low blow on Stuka, Jr. to get the third fall for his team The fifth match centered around the developing rivalry between experienced rudo Averno and the up-and-coming tecnico Titán that had started the previous week. For this match Averno teamed up with Niebla Roja and Pólvora while Titán was joined by Guerrero Maya, Jr. and La Sombra. The focus lay solidly on the feud between Averno and Titán throughout the match, especially as Averno began to tear at Titán's mask, ripping it open. Averno's team took the first fall, then Averno himself pinned Titán after he applied his signature [...] "Devil's Wings" [...] move (a Spinning lifting sitout double underhook facebuster). Following the match Averno challenged Titán to defend his Mexican National Welterweight Championship against Averno the following week, a challenge Titán accepted.|$|E
