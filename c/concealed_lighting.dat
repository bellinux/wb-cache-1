25|$|Columns {{of varying}} height {{supported}} upper floors on the Potomac River {{side of the}} complex, creating an extremely narrow, nonfunctional portico. The capital atop each column was vaguely Corinthian in style, made of shaped sheet metal, and contained <b>concealed</b> <b>lighting</b> fixtures. The {{south side of the}} complex also featured brick piers, pilasters, and pilaster/column combinations. Flying buttresses were used on the upper floors. The glass curtain wall behind which was the Potomac restaurant was decorated with ornamental metalwork similar to that found in Victorian cast-iron pavilions.|$|E
25|$|Among the First Class cabins {{there were}} only four luxury suites, this being {{considered}} enough for even a premiere liner on the South American route. But First Class facilities did include a Grand Hall with a stage and a dance floor, an Observation Lounge, writing rooms, a library that could double as a chapel, and the smokeroom complete with stone fireplace, timber beams, stone corbels supporting some of the beams, wood panelling, and even some Gothic Revival stone tracery. <b>Concealed</b> <b>lighting</b> was a feature {{of many of the}} rooms.|$|E
2500|$|In Baroque sculpture, {{groups of}} figures assumed new importance, {{and there was}} a dynamic {{movement}} and energy of human forms— they spiralled around an empty central vortex, or reached outwards into the surrounding space. Baroque sculpture often had multiple ideal viewing angles, and reflected a general continuation of the Renaissance move away from the relief to sculpture created in the round, and designed to be placed {{in the middle of a}} large space – elaborate fountains such as Bernini's Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Rome, 1651), or those in the Gardens of Versailles were a Baroque speciality. The Baroque style was perfectly suited to sculpture, with Gian Lorenzo Bernini the dominating figure of the age in works such as The Ecstasy of St Theresa (1647–1652). Much Baroque sculpture added extra-sculptural elements, for example, <b>concealed</b> <b>lighting,</b> or water fountains, or fused sculpture and architecture to create a transformative experience for the viewer. Artists saw themselves as in the classical tradition, but admired Hellenistic and later Roman sculpture, rather than that of the more [...] "Classical" [...] periods as they are seen today.|$|E
50|$|The wrestler (using a <b>concealed</b> <b>lighter)</b> {{lights a}} piece of flash paper and throws it at the opponent's face, giving the {{impression}} of a supernatural ball of fire emerging from their hand. Other variations include spitting alcohol onto lighter or torch.|$|R
50|$|Passive defense {{comprised}} {{the range of}} measures {{designed to protect the}} civilian population from aerial bombings. The prefect of the Nord département was responsible for instituting these measures and ensuring they ran smoothly. They consisted of keeping the public informed, maintaining lookouts, <b>concealing</b> <b>light</b> sources, sounding alarms, and organizing shelters and relief efforts.|$|R
60|$|Sammy Brown sat {{comfortably in}} the leather {{armchair}} {{by the open}} window. His suit was a vehement brown with visible checks, beautifully matched in shade by the ends of four cigars that his vest pocket poorly <b>concealed.</b> <b>Light</b> tan were his shoes, gray his socks, sky-blue his apparent linen, snowy and high and adamantine his collar, against which a black butterfly had alighted and spread his wings. Sammy's face--least important--was round and pleasant and pinkish, and in his eyes you saw no haven for fleeing Romance.|$|R
60|$|A third button {{turned on}} his reading lamp, so {{arranged}} that the light fell from above and behind without shining into his eyes. The first button turned off the <b>concealed</b> <b>lighting</b> overhead. He reached a mass of proofsheets from the reading stand, and, pencil in hand, lighting a cigarette, he began to correct.|$|E
60|$|Not {{until the}} smile faded, {{which was a}} matter of seconds, did he reach out in the dark and press the first of a row of buttons. There were three rows of such buttons. The <b>concealed</b> <b>lighting</b> that spilled from the huge bowl under the ceiling {{revealed}} a sleeping-porch, three sides of which were fine-meshed copper screen. The fourth side was the house wall, solid concrete, through which French windows gave access.|$|E

And the bunch he's got with him--Watson and Gorman their names are; they came in after you left--real sea-dogs, middle-aged, marred and battered, tough as rusty wrought-iron nails and twice as dangerous; real ugly customers, with guns in their belts, who don't strike me as just the right sort to be on such comradely terms with Swithin Hall. And the woman! She's a lady. I mean it. She knows {{a whole lot of}} South America, and of China, too. I'm sure she's Spanish, though her English is natural. She's travelled. We talked bull-fights. She's seen them in Guayaquil, in Mexico, in Seville. She knows a lot about sealskins.|$|E

5000|$|French authorities, {{and later}} the German authorities, greatly {{emphasized}} the need to <b>conceal</b> <b>light</b> sources. Allied bombings frequently took place at night so that the planes could avoid being spotted. A German circular issued by General Niehoff on June 25, 1940 called on the city's residents to equip their outward-facing windows and other openings with curtains and shutters. The circular also called on residents to decrease the brightness of their lights, for example by using lampshades. It concluded by warning citizens that [...] "any person in breach of these rules or other ad hoc prescriptions will be fined [...] RM or imprisoned {{for a period of}} up to one year." ...|$|R

50|$|Not {{as large}} as some later ABC houses the Regal {{accommodated}} 1,594 but had a full stage 26 ft deep behind the 43 ft wide proscenium. The interior was rather plainer than many of Glen's cinemas with <b>concealed</b> <b>lighting</b> under the balcony and {{at the rear of}} the ceiling and pendant fittings casting light upwards towards the front of the cinema.|$|E
50|$|In 1966, Turrell began {{experimenting with}} light in his Santa Monica studio, the Mendota Hotel, {{at a time}} when the {{so-called}} Light and Space group of artists in Los Angeles, including Robert Irwin, Mary Corse and Doug Wheeler, was coming into prominence. By covering the windows and only allowing prescribed amounts of light from the street outside to come through the openings, Turrell created his first light projections. In Shallow Space Constructions (1968) he used screened partitions, allowing a radiant effusion of <b>concealed</b> <b>light</b> to create an artificially flattened effect within the given space. That same year, he participated in the Los Angeles County Museum's Art and Technology Program, investigating perceptual phenomena with the artist Robert Irwin and psychologist Edward Wortz.|$|R
50|$|The {{long side}} walls are each punctuated by four blind balconies, {{set into the}} alcoves formed by the {{elongated}} ceiling groins. These balcony alcoves have low plasterwork balustrades at their base, tall mirrored panels on the flat wall behind and are capped by elaborate plasterwork canopies, from which red velvet curtains with a gold tasselled fringe are suspended. Below each blind balcony are mirrored panels with a darkly painted plaster border. Between them, from floor level to just below the ceiling, are paired, rounded pilasters encrusted with tracery. Single columns sit between the end balconies and the wall corners. Brass candelabra are fixed between each balcony at balustrade height and <b>concealed</b> <b>lights</b> {{at the top of}} the pilasters shine up onto the arched, painted ceiling.|$|R

50|$|With clear {{windows on}} all four sides, the cathedral is flooded with light {{at any time of}} the day. This, {{together}} with the white walls and stone floor, combines to give a translucent effect which uplifts the spirit and conveys its own sense of the presence of God. The cathedral is lit by brass English Classical chandeliers (one of which was formerly in the church at Epping) and, above the cornice, <b>concealed</b> <b>lighting.</b>|$|E
50|$|The new {{entrance}} {{was designed}} by Lina Viluma and Sherief al Rifa’i, who were chosen {{as part of a}} competition to redesign the entrance of St Anne’s to make it more visible, accessible and welcoming. The new design uses <b>concealed</b> <b>lighting,</b> neon and wooden panelling to create an inviting space that is also eye catching. Push plates on the front doors carry the imprints of the hands of local community members, and the corridor is lined with illuminated display cases.|$|E

The spare wheel and its tyre are mounted forward of the driver's door.|$|E
500|$|The Arras-Vimy {{sector was}} conducive to tunnel {{excavation}} {{owing to the}} soft, porous yet extremely stable nature of the chalk underground. As a result, pronounced underground warfare had been {{a feature of the}} Vimy sector since 1915. In preparation for the Battle of Vimy Ridge, five British tunnelling companies excavated 12subways along the Canadian Corps' front, the longest of which was [...] in length. The tunnellers excavated the subways at a depth of 10metres to ensure protection from large calibre howitzer shellfire. The subways were often dug at a pace of four metres a day and were often two metres tall and one metre wide. This underground network often incorporated or included <b>concealed</b> <b>light</b> rail lines, hospitals, command posts, water reservoirs, ammunition stores, mortar and machine gun posts, and communication centres.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} hall, {{served by}} southbound trains terminating at Tretyakovskaya and Novoyasenevskaya, {{was designed by}} R. Pogrebnoy and V. Filippov. It features curved white marble separated by translucent panels which <b>conceal</b> fluorescent <b>light</b> fixtures. The walls are faced with red marble and decorated {{with a series of}} plaques by Alexander Bourganov depicting great Russian painters.|$|R
60|$|In {{the course}} of the {{conversation}} that succeeded, the officers explained to me the difficulties they had to contend with, which certainly are not trifling. As to station, they said that made no great difference, your duchess being usually an inveterate smuggler. Travellers are not content to supply their own wants, but they purchase for all their friends. This I knew to be true, though not by experience, you will permit me to say, the ambassador's bags, half the time, containing more prohibited articles than despatches. But, notwithstanding this explanation, I did not deem the case of one who bought only for himself the less hard. It is so easy to <b>conceal</b> <b>light</b> articles, that, except in instances where is reason for distrust, it were better to confide in character. If anything could induce me to enter seriously into the contraband, it would be such treatment.|$|R
5000|$|Seagram Building, New York (1958): Tinted-windowed modernist {{skyscraper}} {{designed with}} {{a strip of}} luminous ceiling on outsides of all floors to counter sky glare {{during the day and}} provide a night-time [...] "tower of light" [...] appearance in contrast to daytime appearance; ground floor made four times brighter than upper floors by white marble illuminated from <b>concealed</b> <b>lighting</b> slots.

50|$|English Heritage {{notes the}} Cambridge Theatre is a rare, {{complete}} and early {{example of a}} London theatre adopting the moderne, expressionist style pioneered in Germany during the 1920s. It marked a conscious reaction to the design excesses of the music hall and contemporary cinemas. Theatres looked for a new style appropriate to the greater sophistication of their entertainment and {{found it in the}} Germanic moderne forms of simple shapes enlivened by <b>concealed</b> <b>lighting,</b> shiny steelwork and touches of bright colour; this was not taken up by cinema designers until 1935.|$|E
50|$|The upper storey {{features}} a panelled foyer and auditorium, with a stage and fly tower. The hall has an elliptical arched fibrous cement ceiling, supported on piers panelled with walnut {{and decorated with}} plaster fluting and volutes.

[...] Today, LED floodlights rotate through an abundance of colors and dazzle onlookers.|$|R
60|$|I found a den, {{or small}} hollow, {{where there was}} a spring of pure water; and there, {{clearing}} away the brambles, I pitched the tent, and made a fire to cook my supper. My horse I picketed farther in the wood {{where there was a}} patch of sward. The banks of the den not only <b>concealed</b> the <b>light</b> of my fire, but sheltered me from the wind, which was cold as well as high.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, the {{building}} underwent refurbishment, {{but this was}} mostly only minor cosmetic refurbishment. Coinciding with the completion of Central Park, the $15 million project was conducted by Multiplex. The refurbishment involved a facelift for the ground floor lobby, including polished granite flooring, wall panelling and coffered ceilings with <b>concealed</b> <b>lighting,</b> improved revolving doors, new glass and planter boxes. The facelift also saw the repaving of {{the building}}'s forecourt with cobblestone, new landscaping, further public seating and {{the integration of the}} tower's underground car parking with Central Park's.|$|E

50|$|Situated {{immediately}} {{below the}} Temple Hall, the Crypt houses the first Book of Remembrance. 1,100 pages long, it bears {{the names of}} 35,000 {{men and women of}} Welsh birth and parentage, and the men who served in Welsh regiments who lost their lives in the first World War. As most died on Belgian or French soil, the bronze used on the glass casing of the Book of Remembrance is French, and the marble pedestal on which it rests is from Belgium. <b>Concealed</b> <b>lighting</b> illuminates the book from the roof of the Crypt.|$|E
60|$|Eugène, Prince of Seyre, {{had spent}} {{the early part of}} that {{afternoon}} in a manner wholly strange to him. In pursuance of an order given to his majordomo immediately on his return from the club after lunch, the great reception rooms of Seyre House, the picture-gallery and the ballroom, were prepared as if for a reception. Dust-sheets were swept aside, masterpieces of painting and sculpture were uncovered, the soft brilliance of <b>concealed</b> electric <b>lights</b> lit up many dark corners.|$|R
6000|$|Without {{hesitation}} I obeyed him, {{a strange}} excitement thrilling me.
