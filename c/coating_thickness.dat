25|$|The {{reflectivity}} of {{a mirror}} {{is determined by the}} percentage of reflected light per the percentage of the incident light. The reflectivity may vary with wavelength. All or a portion of the light not reflected is absorbed by the mirror, while in some cases a portion may also transmit through. Although some small portion of the light will be absorbed by the coating, the reflectivity is usually higher for first-surface mirrors, eliminating both reflection and absorption losses from the substrate. The reflectivity is often determined by the type and thickness of the coating. When the thickness of the coating is sufficient to prevent transmission, all of the losses occur due to absorption. Aluminum will reflect 85 to 90% of the light in the visible to near-ultraviolet range, but is a poor reflector of infrared wavelengths longer than 800 nm. Gold is up to 96% reflective to near and far-infrared light between 800 and 12000 nm, but poorly reflects visible light with wavelengths shorter than 600 nm (yellow). Silver has the highest reflectivity in the visual to near-infrared of any metal, and can reflect up to 98 or 99% of light to wavelengths as long as 2000 nm, but loses nearly all reflectivity at wavelengths shorter than 350 nm. Dielectric mirrors can reflect greater than 99.99% of light, but only for a narrow range of wavelengths. However, dielectric coatings can also enhance the reflectivity of metallic coatings and protect them from scratching or tarnishing. In mirrors with low tolerances, the <b>coating</b> <b>thickness</b> may be reduced to save cost, and simply covered with paint to absorb transmission.|$|E

40|$|Determining {{the age of}} {{abandonment}} of alluvial fan surfaces is crucial in relating fan development to past climate change or using fans as strain markers for neotectonic deformation. Cosmogenic surface exposure dating is not readily applicable to fan surfaces of the Lost River Range where large quartz-rich boulders are scarce, and loess has been deposited and eroded. Prior studies have shown, however, that the thickness of dense, laminated pedogenic carbonate pebble coats is useful for relative age and correlation of alluvial fans and moraines. Tributaries Northwest of Mackay, Idaho deliver limestone rich sediment from the Lost River Mountains to the Big Lost River before joining the Snake River south of Arco, Idaho. Numerical 230 Th/U ages of pedogenic carbonate samples from trenches on abandoned and incised sheetflood dominated alluvial fans will date the time of fansurface abandonment. Calcium carbonate <b>coat</b> <b>thicknesses</b> are most developed in the upper-most B-horizon but depositional periods mixed with longer periods of temporary abandonment may complicate the depth of maximum accumulation. <b>Coating</b> <b>thicknesses</b> {{as a function of}} depth were measured in soil profiles developed on Ramshorn and Upper Cedar Creek fan consisting of coarse sand to cobble size clasts overlain by loess. The CaCO 3 <b>coating</b> <b>thicknesses</b> measured from six distinct zones within the subdivided B-horizon can be used to illustrate the zone of maximum calcium carbonate accumulation and the downward thinning of coats there after.
