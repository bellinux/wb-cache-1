500|$|This episode {{addresses}} {{the death of}} Dale Horvath, who is attacked and ripped open by a walker. Since writer Robert Kirkman felt that Dale epitomized a character of morality and humanity, much of [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] explores themes related to the declining morality of individuals during a catastrophic event. Kirkman proclaimed that Dale's death was a momentous occasion, ultimately marking {{a turning point for}} future development of The Walking Dead. [...] "Dale's character has been {{the heart and soul of}} the show," [...] he iterated. [...] "He's definitely the moral compass. He’s the guy that, more so than anyone, has been warning people to be careful how you let this world <b>change</b> <b>you</b> and monitoring what lengths people are going to survive. His loss is going to mean a great deal for all the characters in the show and is definitely going to represent a turn to a darker space. His death means a lot." [...] Kirkman added that it was difficult to release DeMunn from the cast. He stated: [...] "It’s heartbreaking to lose Jeffrey DeMunn. He's really given us a lot, these last two seasons on the show. It's been amazing to work with him and get to know him and he’s an awesome dude and we’re definitely going to miss him." ...|$|E

That responsibility stays with me now, and will stay with {{me for the rest of}} my life.

And it does <b>change</b> <b>you,</b> and so it should." [...] BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said Blair's severest critics would see the donation as [...] "guilt money" [...] for taking the UK to war against Iraq in 2003. The father of a soldier killed there decried the donation as [...] "blood money", while the father of another serviceman who died said Blair had a [...] "guilty conscience." [...] A spokesperson for the Stop the War Coalition supported with the donation, but added, [...] "No proportion of Tony Blair's massive and ill-gotten fortune can buy him innocence or forgiveness. He took this country to war on a series of lies against the best legal advice and in defiance of majority opinion." [...] A spokesman for Blair said that it had long been his intention to give the money to a charity; he added aiding soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the Battle Back Challenge Centre was [...] "his way of honouring their courage and sacrifice." [...] The announcement was welcomed by Chris Simpkins, director general of The Royal British Legion, who said, [...] "Mr Blair's generosity is much appreciated and will help us to make a real and lasting difference to the lives of hundreds of injured personnel." ...|$|E

2500|$|Obama and Clinton {{were in a}} {{statistical}} dead heat in Texas, according to a poll released February 25, 2008. During Obama's sweep of February's post-Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses, the March 4 primaries of Texas and Ohio were seen as a firewall for the Clinton campaign. In early polls for these states, Clinton held double digit leads in polls for those states, {{but by the end}} of February Obama had started to erode Clinton's lead in her key demographics, and her lead had been reduced to single digits in some polls. In response to Obama's increases, Clinton's campaign began to increase their attacks on him, including an accusation of plagiarism due to similarities in Obama's campaign speeches and campaign speeches of Obama's campaign's national co-chair and Massachusetts governor, Deval Patrick, although Patrick specifically stated he told Obama to use it. During the February 21, CNN-Univision debate in Austin, Texas Obama responded to the accusation by saying, [...] "The notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who's one of my national co-chairs, who gave me the line and suggested that I use it, I think is silly."

When the helicopter attacks, it is piloted by Jordan, and in the drowning pool, Torque fights Copperfield. Later, Blackmore reveals that he gave Cory spiked drugs prior to Cory's murder of Malcolm and subsequent suicide.
