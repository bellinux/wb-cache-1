5|$|In his <b>commentary</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ancient Confucian philosopher Mencius (372–289 BC), Shen {{wrote of}} the {{importance}} of choosing to follow what one knew to be a true path, yet the heart and mind could not attain full knowledge of truth through mere sensory experience. In his own unique way but using terms influenced by the ideas of Mencius, Shen wrote of an autonomous inner authority that formed the basis for one's inclination towards moral choices, a concept linked to Shen's life experiences of surviving and obtaining success through self-reliance. Along with his <b>commentary</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Chinese classic texts, Shen Kuo also wrote extensively on the topics of supernatural divination and Buddhist meditation.|$|E
