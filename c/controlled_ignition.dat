40|$|This conference {{paper is}} Closed access. <b>Controlled</b> Auto <b>Ignition</b> (CAI) uses the {{internal}} {{energy of the}} compressed charge to auto-ignite the mixture. Using internal exhaust gas re-circulation (IEGR) as an indirect control method, CAI offers superior fuel economy and pollutant emission reductions. Practically, this can readily be achieved by a method of early exhaust valve closure and late inlet valve opening to trap a large quantity of exhaust gas residuals within the cylinder from one cycle to the next. Although the emission and fuel economy can be largely improved, the engine power output is limited to part-load conditions only. At high-load, conventional Spark Ignition (SI) is required. In this research, both SI and CAI and the transition between the two were investigated on a single-cylinder research engine equipped with Lotus’ Research Active Valve Train (AVT) System.

Cryogenic experiments using targets filled with liquid deuterium further demonstrated the entire timing technique in a Hohlraum environment. Direct-drive cryogenic targets with multiple spherical shocks were used to further validate this technique, including convergence effects at relevant pressures (velocities) and sizes.
