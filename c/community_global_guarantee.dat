In this work, we propose to study the privacy guarantee for such transient sensitive values, which we call the <b>global</b> <b>guarantee.</b> We formally define the problem for achieving this guarantee. We show that the data satisfying the <b>global</b> <b>guarantee</b> also satisfies a privacy guarantee commonly adopted in the privacy literature called the local guarantee. I...|$|R

5000|$|As the Supreme Potentates of the <b>Global</b> <b>Community,</b> Nicolae Carpathia {{establishes}} {{its headquarters}} at the <b>Global</b> <b>Community</b> Palace in New Babylon. For {{the first few}} years Carpathia worked to unify and merge all businesses, industries and media outlets through either financial means (being the sole beneficiary of Jonathan Stonagal, the richest man in history) or by mind control and putting them under GC authority. Carpathia also established new organizations to keep control of the population, including <b>Global</b> <b>Community</b> Cable News Network (GCCNN), <b>Global</b> <b>Community</b> Peacekeepers, <b>Global</b> <b>Community</b> Morale Monitors, <b>Global</b> <b>Community</b> Aeronautics and Space Administration (GCASA), <b>Global</b> <b>Community</b> Power and Light (GCP&L), and Enigma Babylon One World Faith. A new single global currency called the <b>Global</b> <b>Community</b> Dollar, nicknamed [...] "Nicks" [...] (after Carpathia himself), is established. In less than a year, the <b>Global</b> <b>Community</b> is the dominant state on Earth, with Carpathia at its head. As a result of the GC’s rise, New Babylon becomes the biggest, richest, most advanced and most beautiful city in the world.|$|R

40|$|Evolutionary Game Theory is {{the study}} of {{strategic}} interactions among large populations of agents who base their decisions on simple, myopic rules. A major goal of the theory is to determine broad classes of decision procedures which both provide plausible descriptions of selfish behaviour and include appealing forms of aggregate behaviour.

40|$|The popular yet {{paradoxical}} idea of {{a diverse}} <b>global</b> <b>community</b> raises questions about language and translation. Would a <b>global</b> <b>community</b> with a <b>global</b> language lose its other languages? Would a <b>global</b> <b>community</b> without a <b>global</b> language be able to interact efficiently across thousands of linguistic frontiers? One strategy that might make <b>global</b> <b>community</b> compatible with linguistic diversity is panlingual transparency via aspectual phased translation. With it, translators translate aspects of a discourse at each phase of a multiphase process, rather than translating the discourse in its entirety in a single act. In an initial simple model, communication in a <b>global</b> <b>community</b> relies on translation partitioned into four phases; the translation in each is either linguistic or cultural, but not both. A source discourse is translated culturally (within the source language), then linguistically (from the source language to a global representation), then linguistically (from the global representation to the target languages), then culturally (within the target languages). Such partitioning could elevate productivity by facilitating divisions of labor between professiona...|$|R

40|$|Mixture {{modeling}} is {{a general}} technique for making any simple model more ex-pressive through weighted combination. This generality and simplicity in part explains {{the success of the}} Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in which updates are easy to derive for a wide class of mixture models. However, the likeli-hood of a mixture model is non-convex, so EM has no known <b>global</b> convergence <b>guarantees.</b> Recently, method of moments approaches offer <b>global</b> <b>guarantees</b> for some mixture models, but they do not extend easily to the range of mixture mod-els that exist. In this work, we present Polymom, an unifying framework based on method of moments in which estimation procedures are easily derivable, just as in EM. Polymom is applicable when the moments of a single mixture component are polynomials of the parameters. Our key observation is that the moments of the mixture model are a mixture of these polynomials, which allows us to cast estimation as a Generalized Moment Problem. We solve its relaxations using semidefinite optimization, and then extract parameters using ideas from computer algebra. This framework allows us to draw insights and apply tools from convex optimization, computer algebra and the theory of moments to study problems in statistical estimation. Simulations show good empirical performance on several models. ...|$|R
