5|$|Niobium {{is used as}} a {{precious}} metal in commemorative coins, often with silver or gold. For example, Austria produced a series of silver niobium euro coins starting in 2003; the colour in these coins is created by the diffraction of light by a thin anodized oxide layer. In 2012, ten coins are available showing a broad variety of colours in the centre of the coin: blue, green, brown, purple, violet, or yellow. Two more examples are the 2004 Austrian €25 150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway <b>commemorative</b> <b>coin,</b> and the 2006 Austrian €25 European Satellite Navigation <b>commemorative</b> <b>coin.</b>|$|E

Designs by sculptor Jo Mora met a hostile reception at the Commission of Fine Arts, but the Citizens' Committee would not change them, and they were approved. The coin has been widely praised for its beauty in the years since.|$|E
5|$|Commemorative coins with €2 {{face value}} {{have been issued}} with changes {{to the design of}} the {{national}} side of the coin.

5|$|More of the {{octagonal}} $50 {{pieces were}} sold {{than of the}} round, as the former proved more popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and because people liked the dolphins.
