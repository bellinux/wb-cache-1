40|$|Abstract—Recoil decay tagging (RDT) {{is a very}} {{powerful}} method for the spectroscopy of exotic nuclei. RDT is a delayed coincidence technique between detectors usually at the target position and at the focal plane of a spectrometer. Such measure-ments are often limited by dead time. This paper describes a novel triggerless data acquisition method, which is being developed for the gamma recoil electron alpha tagging (GREAT) spectrometer, that overcomes this limitation by virtually eliminating dead time. Our solution is a total data readout (TDR) method where all channels run independently and are associated in software to re-construct events. The TDR method allows all the data from both target position and focal plane to be collected with practically no dead-time losses. Each data word is associated with a timestamp generated from a global 100 -MHz clock. Events are then recon-structed in real time in the event builder using temporal and spa-tial associations defined by the physics of the experiment.

It involved the sudden recognition that existing muon beams would be polarized if parity were not conserved, together with the appreciation that the angular distribution of decay electrons from the population of stopped muons could be observed (much more reliably and sensitively) by the variation with time or current of the detections in a fixed counter telescope than by the measurement of the decay asymmetry of nominally fixed muon spins. This retrospective paper explains the context, {{the state of the art}} at the time, and what we expected as a consequence of this experiment.

5000|$|There {{are many}} desired {{properties}} of scintillators, {{such as high}} density, fast operation speed, low cost, radiation hardness, production capability and durability of operational parameters.High density reduces the material size of showers for high-energy γ-quanta and electrons. The range of Compton scattered photons for lower energy γ-rays is also decreased via high density materials. This results in high segmentation of the detector and leads to better spatial resolution. Usually high density materials have heavy ions in the lattice (e.g., lead, cadmium), significantly increasing the photo-fraction (~Z4). The increased photo-fraction is important for some applications such as positron emission tomography. High stopping power for electromagnetic component of the ionizing radiation needs greater photo-fraction; this allows for a compact detector.High operating speed is needed for good resolution of spectra. Precision of time measurement with a scintillation detector is proportional to [...] Short decay times are important for the measurement of time intervals and for the operation in fast <b>coincidence</b> <b>circuits.</b> High density and fast response time can allow detection of rare events in particle physics.Particle energy deposited in the material of a scintillator {{is proportional to the}} scintillator's response. Charged particles, γ-quanta and ions have different slopes when their response is measured. Thus, scintillators could be used to identify various types of γ-quanta and particles in fluxes of mixed radiation.Another consideration of scintillators is the cost of producing them. Most crystal scintillators require high-purity chemicals and sometimes rare-earth metals that are fairly expensive. Not only are the materials an expenditure, but many crystals require expensive furnaces and almost six months of growth and analyzing time. Currently, other scintillators are being researched for reduced production cost.|$|R

The time-average output of the mixer is shown to be proportional to the rate of true coincidences, and therefore to the angular correlation function.
