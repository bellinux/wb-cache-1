5|$|The complex geology {{and narrow}} seams made the coal {{extraction}} difficult; three underground explosions, in 1893, 1895 and 1908, were amongst the first attributable solely to airborne <b>coal</b> <b>dust.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mines Inspectorate {{began an}} enquiry, chaired by the mining {{engineer}} William Galloway. The report was published on 15 July. It {{stated that the}} mine was hot {{with high levels of}} <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> present. The method used to load coal onto underground trucks created quantities of dust, which had aggravated a small explosion and created a chain reaction of related explosions throughout the workings. An inquest held in October concluded that various safety precautions had not been followed, and had the mine been sufficiently watered it would have reduced the <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> held in the air. The colliery had further problems in October 1910 when a heavy roof fall in the Mafeking return released trapped firedamp, which caused the mine to be temporarily evacuated.|$|E
5|$|The {{inquiry report}} failed to {{identify}} a definite cause, although it was considered that the most likely cause was a spark from the signalling gear. It would have ignited the firedamp, exacerbated and fuelled by <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> in the air. The report was critical of {{many aspects of the}} management's practices, and considered it had breached the mining regulations in respect of measuring and maintaining the air quality in the workings, and in the removal of <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> from the tracks and walkways. The report pointed out that because the management had not implemented the changes needed to the ventilation fans as demanded by the Coal Mines Act 1911, the fans were unable to reverse the direction of the airflow, which would have blown the smoke out through the Lancaster shaft, although Redmayne and his colleagues held differing opinions on the advisability of reversing or stopping the airflow. The historian John H Brown, in his examination of the disaster, states that had the airflow been reversed, firedamp or afterdamp could have been extracted from some sectors into the blaze, causing another explosion.|$|E

50|$|Coal ash {{contains}} many toxic substances that can negatively impact the human body. Employees working in {{coal-fired power plants}} or near coal ash waste sites are at major risk of inhaling <b>coal</b> ash <b>dust.</b> <b>Coal</b> ash <b>dust</b> is generally known as particulate matter (particle pollution) and the dust particles can harm the lungs when inhaled. Workers increase their risk of harmful side effects when they inhale the smallest <b>coal</b> ash <b>dust</b> particles. The smaller the <b>coal</b> ash <b>dust</b> particle, the deeper the particle will be inhaled into the lungs. As a result, the toxic particles can inflame the lungs causing severe damage to the body. Furthermore, <b>coal</b> ash <b>dust</b> can enter the body through the nose causing damage to the brain directly. However, regardless of particle entry, the toxicity from coal ash can cause harm to major body parts such as the brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach and intestines. Thus, individuals working near coal ash surface impoundments or landfills {{are at increased risk}} for many serious health problems.|$|R

5|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} was pollution. Brick firing produced {{particulate air pollution}} and paint-making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain swill. The worst pollution was <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> and smoke, for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. The greatest number of complaints to the St. Louis Board of Health were due to industries engaged in rendering, which produced noxious fumes. In spite of this, pollution control was hindered {{by a desire to}} promote growth. One of the few controls began in 1880, in which regulations would be enforced strictly in some areas while little in others, thereby encouraging factories to concentrate in industrial districts.|$|E
5|$|As mentioned, the British Railways batch had detail {{differences}} to previous versions. The most significant modification was {{the reduction of}} weight using lighter materials unavailable during wartime. From 1952 the air-smoothed casing ahead of the cylinders was removed to ease maintenance and lubrication. This coincided with {{the removal of the}} tender 'raves' on all locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing the locomotive. The resultant 'cut-down' tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons, revised step ladders and glass spectacle plates to protect the crew from flying <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> when running tender-first.|$|E

5|$|In 1906 a major {{explosion}} at a colliery in Courrières, northern France, caused {{the deaths of}} more than 1,000 miners. The subsequent report blamed the accidental ignition of firedamp, exacerbated by <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> in the air. Concerned that a similar disaster might happen in British collieries, the Royal Commission was formed, reporting back in 1907, 1909 and 1911. The reports led to the Coal Mines Act 1911, which came into force December that year. Among other changes {{to the health and}} safety culture, the act required that ventilation fans in all collieries be capable of reversing the air current underground; this measure was to be implemented by 1 January 1913.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about West Alseks {{subsequent}} civilian career until early 1929. In February of that year, West Alsek, still under USSB ownership, was selected for the addition of pulverized coal-fired boilers for testing purposes. Coal pulverizers would take coal—often cheaper, inferior grades normally unsuitable for marine use—and grind them into <b>coal</b> <b>dust.</b> This dust would then be mixed with air and automatically injected into the boilers {{without the need for}} hand-feeding. West Alsek entered the Todd Brooklyn shipyard to undergo the conversion in late February.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} heavy industry, the {{possibility}} of serious injury or death was an everyday risk for the mine workers of the Rhondda Valley. The most notorious form of colliery disaster was the gas explosion, caused by either a buildup of methane gas or <b>coal</b> <b>dust.</b> As the mines became deeper and ventilation become more difficult to control the risk increased. The worst single incident in the Rhondda was the 1867 Ferndale disaster in which an explosion saw the loss of 178 lives. However, the major disasters only accounted for roughly 20% of overall fatalities, with individual accidents accounting {{for the bulk of}} deaths. The list below shows mining disasters which saw the loss of five or more lives during a single incident.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} this federal {{regulation}} to be effective, {{there are some}} major requirements that surface impoundments and landfill facilities must follow. This rule requires facilities to prevent and control <b>coal</b> ash <b>dust</b> from accumulating into the air. As a result, facilities must provide annual plans for <b>coal</b> ash <b>dust</b> control. Furthermore, there are location restrictions where new landfills and surface impoundments can be built. In addition, if regulations of <b>coal</b> ash <b>dust</b> control are not maintained, closure of the facility will occur under the federal law. The law also requires all coal ash waste facilities to create annual groundwater monitoring reports. Lastly, all coal ash waste surface impoundments and landfills must keep a written record of the federal regulations at the facility for five years. Ultimately, this recent federal regulation is trying to eliminate occupational health concerns and environmental health issues regarding coal ash toxicity.|$|R

5|$|Following {{financial}} difficulties during the First World War, the mining operations were bought by Store Norske, which was incorporated in Oslo on 30 November 1916. That year, SNSK built five new barracks, {{including one that}} {{was made into a}} hospital. SNSK introduced its own money with approval from Norges Bank, consisting entirely of banknotes at par with Norwegian krone. The American community buried their dead at Hotellneset. In 1918, eleven people were killed by the Spanish flu and a graveyard was established in Longyear City. Two years later, 26 men were killed in a <b>coal</b> <b>dust</b> explosion in Mine 1.

5|$|In {{an earlier}} {{disaster}} in May 1901, three underground explosions at the colliery killed 81 miners.

The cause of the 1913 explosion is unknown, but the subsequent inquiry thought the most likely cause was a spark from underground signalling equipment that could have ignited any firedamp present.

5|$|Norway is {{a country}} with {{abundance}} of hydroelectricity and NSB saw {{huge amounts of money}} burning up with the imported coal. Plans for electrification of the line is as old as the railway itself, and in 1912 the line from Nesttun to Bergen was proposed electrified and rebuilt to double track, having seen the Thamshavn Line open with electric traction in 1908. During the planning of the Hardanger Line and the Flåm Line during the 30s the suggestion again arose, and both the branch lines were built with electric traction, but not the main line. Countersuggestions were raised proposing a conversion to the locomotives running on oil or <b>coal</b> <b>dust.</b> In 1939 a plan for national electrification was launched, and the Voss Line was top priority.

40|$|Rats {{were exposed}} by {{inhalation}} to <b>coal</b> mine <b>dust,</b> titanium dioxide, or quartz. The {{magnitude of the}} consequent inflammatory response was assessed by counting numbers and types of leukocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The magnitude of the inflam response reflected the toxicity of the dusts, with quartz eliciting the greatest recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes, <b>coal</b> mine <b>dust</b> less than quartz, and titanium dioxide eliciting no inflammation. To assess {{the persistence of the}} inflammation, groups of rats were maintained in room air for 30 or 60 days after cessation of dust exposure and then numbers of leukocytes were asseed.

The chemotactic responses of bronchoalveolar leukocytes from rats inhaling <b>coal</b> mine <b>dust</b> and quartz were reduced and remained so after a 30 -day recovery period. Their reduced ability to chemotact did not fully prevent macrophages from leaving the bronchoalveolar region of dust-exposed rats.

METHODS [...] Blood samples were randomly obtained from active surface workers (n = 30) and underground miners (n = 34), and from retired miners without (n = 21), and with (n = 33) pneumoconiosis. Antioxidant enzyme activities and total plasma antioxidants were measured in erythrocytes and plasma. Non-parametric tests were completed by analyses of covariance to compare antioxidants between groups, taking into account potential confounding factors (age, smoking history (pack-years)). RESULTS [...] Erythrocyte Cu++/Zn++ superoxide dismutase activity was significantly higher {{in the group of}} underground miners than the group of surface workers. The differences in total plasma antioxidants and plasma glutathione peroxidase activity between both groups were related to age. Glutathione peroxidase activity increased in the plasma of retired miners with pneumoconiosis, compared with retired miners without pneumoconiosis. No differences were found either in erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme activities or in total plasma antioxidants between the groups of retired miners without and with pneumoconiosis. CONCLUSIONS [...] In this study, erythrocyte Cu++/Zn++ superoxide dismutase activity may be considered as a marker of effect of respirable <b>coal</b> mine <b>dust</b> in exposed workers. This result is in agreement with the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species are involved in cell injury induced by <b>coal</b> mine <b>dust,</b> and may be predictive of the degree of inflammation and pneumoconiosis induced by <b>coal</b> mine <b>dust.</b> The increase in glutathione peroxidase activity in the plasma of retired miners with pneumoconiosis {{may be the result of}} a response to the increasing hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) production due to the disease process...|$|R
