In 1944–45, the 30-minute Tonight at Hoagy's aired on Mutual radio on Sunday nights at 8:30p.m. (Pacific time), sponsored by Safeway supermarkets. Produced by Walter Snow, the show featured Carmichael as host and vocalist. Musicians included Pee Wee Hunt and Joe Venuti. Fans were rather blunt about Carmichael's singing, providing comments such as [...] "you cannot sing for sour owl" [...] and [...] "your singing is so delightfully awful that it is really funny". NBC carried the 30-minute Something New at 6 p.m. (Pacific time) on Mondays in 1945–46.

Carol Stewart and Gale Robbins were the vocalists and comedy was supplied by Pinky Lee and the team of Bob Sweeney and Hal March of later of quiz-show fame.

50|$|A throat lozenge (<b>cough</b> <b>drop,</b> troche, cachou, or cough sweet) is a small, {{typically}} medicated tablet {{intended to}} be dissolved slowly in the mouth to temporarily stop coughs and lubricate and soothe irritated tissues of the throat (usually due to a sore throat), possibly from the common cold or influenza. Cough tablets have taken the name lozenge, based on their original shape, a diamond.|$|R
50|$|In late July 1916 the 1/6th marched {{south to}} begin {{training}} {{to enter the}} ongoing Somme offensive. The battalion practised on positions marked out by flags, and adopted identification stripes on their arms: A Company blue, B Co green, C Co red and D Co yellow. On 15 September, 47th Division attacked High Wood to cover the left flank of the tank-led attack of the adjacent divisions on Flers. The first objective for 140 Bde was a line clear of High Wood (the Switch Line), the second was the Starfish Line on the forward slope, after which 1/6th Londons would pass through to take the Flers Line. The leading waves were engaged in heavy fighting and the brigade got to the Starfish Line, after which 1/6th pressed on. The battalion suffered badly from enfilade machine-gun fire {{from the direction of}} High Wood (which had still not been cleared), when 'whole waves of men were mown down in line'. Although a few men reached the Flers Line it could not be held, and the remaining two officers and 100 men (including 50 who came up from the transport lines) consolidated a position known as the <b>Cough</b> <b>Drop,</b> a group of German trenches in a valley west of Flers, though their position was unknown to headquarters. The following day a follow-up attack linked up with the 1/6th holding out in the <b>Cough</b> <b>Drop,</b> and at dawn on 18 September the battalion contributed to a mixed force that succeeded in occupying the Flers Line. The 1/6th was relieved in the <b>Cough</b> <b>Drop</b> on the morning of 20 September. The regiment received the battle honour Flers-Courcelette for this action.|$|R

By 17 September the Guards Division had been relieved by the 20th Division and on the right, the 60th Brigade was attacked and eventually managed to repulse the Germans.

50|$|The {{candy bar}} was {{introduced}} in 1936 by William H. Luden, the <b>cough</b> <b>drop</b> maker and founder of Luden's, {{at the time a}} subsidiary of Food Industries of Philadelphia.

Despite not being advertised since 1993, the candy bar is still available in many smaller retailers. The originals had almonds, the new ones do not. The origin of the name seems to be lost to history. Our speculation is that Mr. Luden was attempting to associate his elegant candy bar with that of fashionable 5th Avenue in New York City.|$|R
