5|$|When he {{was named}} to the Grantland Rice team the {{following}} week, the Globe reported: “Heikkinen’s exceptional analytical ability on defense and his near-perfect blocking on offense this last season has gained him a position on every major all-star team <b>chosen</b> <b>this</b> year.” On December 8, 1938, the Globe announced that a banquet honoring Heikkinen would be held with “Hike” himself traveling north to attend.|$|E
5|$|His first {{squadron}} was No. 29 Squadron RAF, {{based at}} RAF West Malling, flying the two-seater Hawker Demon. In February 1939 No 29 Squadron re-equipped with the Bristol Blenheim. Braham was disappointed at not being {{trained on the}} Hawker Hurricane and his reaction to this news was request a transfer which was refused. The squadron spent three months converting onto the Blenheim. In August 1939 No. 29 did convert to the Hurricane but upon the outbreak of war the squadron was reverted to the Blenheim {{as part of its}} reorientation to night fighter rather than daylight fighter operations. Braham soon earned the nickname 'Bob', which stayed with him throughout his service career. He had <b>chosen</b> <b>this</b> Christian name as his radio call sign to distinguish himself from the multitude of other Johns in the unit.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, PSA {{decided that}} their new small Talbot {{would also be}} based on the 104 rather than the Horizon. Keeping the common {{underpinnings}} allowed the new model, known internally as project C15 (later renamed to T15 to reflect the brand change from Chrysler to Talbot) to be launched in 1981, in time to replace the Sunbeam when Linwood would close. In order not to create too much internal competition, a wheelbase between the 3 door and 5 door versions of the 104 was <b>chosen.</b> <b>This</b> made the projected model slot in size slightly below popular superminis such as the Ford Fiesta, but above the city cars, including the about-to-be-launched Austin Metro.|$|E

5|$|The ascent is an {{important}} part of the process of decompression, as this is the time when reduction of ambient pressure occurs, and it is of critical importance to safe decompression that the ascent rate is compatible with safe elimination of inert gas from the diver's tissues. Ascent rate must be limited to prevent supersaturation of tissues to the extent that unacceptable bubble development occurs. This is usually done by specifying a maximum ascent rate compatible with the decompression model <b>chosen.</b> <b>This</b> will be specified in the decompression tables or the user manual for the decompression software or personal decompression computer. The instructions will usually include contingency procedures for deviation from the specified rate, both for delays and exceeding the recommended rate. Failure to comply with these specifications will generally increase the risk of decompression sickness.|$|E
25|$|To {{implement}} {{a ban on}} driving and re-create the event as a pedestrian/bicycle/art-car-only event, {{it was decided to}} move to private gated property. Fly Ranch, with the adjoining Hualapai mini dry lake-bed, just west of the Black Rock desert, was <b>chosen.</b> <b>This</b> moved Burning Man from Pershing county/federal BLM land into the jurisdiction of Washoe County, which brought a protracted list of permit requirements.|$|E
25|$|A DBN {{can be used}} to generatively pre-train a DNN {{by using}} the learned DBN weights as the initial DNN weights. Backpropagation or other discriminative {{algorithms}} can then tune these weights. This is particularly helpful when training data are limited, because poorly initialized weights can significantly hinder model performance. These pre-trained weights are in a region of the weight space that is closer to the optimal weights than were they randomly <b>chosen.</b> <b>This</b> allows for both improved modeling and faster convergence of the fine-tuning phase.|$|E

25|$|William of Ockham (1285–1350), Doctor Invincibilis, was an English Franciscan friar, philosopher, logician and theologian. Ockham {{defended the}} {{principle}} of parsimony, which could already {{be seen in the}} works of his mentor Duns Scotus. His principle later became known as Occam's Razor and states that if there are various equally valid explanations for a fact, then the simplest one should be <b>chosen.</b> <b>This</b> became a foundation of what would {{come to be known as}} the scientific method and one of the pillars of reductionism in science. Ockham probably died of the Black Plague. Jean Buridan and Nicole Oresme were his followers.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} make the {{aircraft}} more manoeuvrable and in particular to increase its roll rate, a triplane configuration was <b>chosen.</b> <b>This</b> provided about the same total wing area as that of the biplane Scout with a lower moment of inertia about the roll axis. The Triplane had single-bay wings with heavy stagger, carrying six ailerons. The lower wing was close to the ground so two underwing skids were added below the interplane struts. The mid-line of the nacelle, with the engine at its rear, was on the centre plane, giving the pilot a slightly inferior view than from the Scout.|$|E
25|$|Rabbinic {{tradition}} ascribes {{the authorship}} of Job to Moses. However, scholars generally {{agree that it}} was written between the 7th and 4th centuries BCE, with the 6th century BCE as the most likely period for various reasons. The anonymous author was almost certainly an Israelite, although he has set his story outside Israel, in southern Edom or northern Arabia, and makes allusion to places as far apart as Mesopotamia and Egypt. According to the 6th-century BCE prophet Ezekiel, Job {{was a man of}} antiquity renowned for his righteousness, and the book's author has <b>chosen</b> <b>this</b> legendary hero for his parable.|$|E

25|$|Murphy concludes that,"Just as the Son of God limited {{himself by}} taking human form and dying on a cross, God limits divine {{action in the}} world to be in accord with {{rational}} laws which God has <b>chosen.</b> <b>This</b> enables us to understand the world on its own terms, but it also means that natural processes hide God from scientific observation."For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a methodological naturalism, meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a metaphysical naturalism, which proposes that nature is all that there is.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} {{of truth in}} an interpretation that uses a variable assignment function cannot work with empty domains, {{because there are no}} variable assignment functions whose range is empty. (Similarly, one cannot assign interpretations to constant symbols.) This truth definition requires that one must select a variable assignment function (μ above) before truth values for even atomic formulas can be defined. Then the truth value of a sentence is defined to be its truth value under any variable assignment, and it is proved that this truth value does not depend on which assignment is <b>chosen.</b> <b>This</b> technique does not work if there are no assignment functions at all; it must be changed to accommodate empty domains.|$|E
25|$|Reformed theologians {{teach that}} sin so affects human nature {{that they are}} unable even to {{exercise}} faith in Christ by their own will. While people are said to retain will, in that they willfully sin, they are unable not to sin because of the corruption of their nature due to original sin. Reformed Christians believe that God predestined some people to be saved. This choice by God to save some is held to be unconditional and not based on any characteristic or action {{on the part of}} the person <b>chosen.</b> <b>This</b> view is opposed to the Arminian view that God's choice of whom to save is conditional or based on his foreknowledge of who would respond positively to God.|$|E

25|$|According {{to another}} author, however, {{the idea of}} Hudal's {{intervention}} came from the German ambassador himself, who asked the rector of the Anima to sign {{a letter to the}} military commander of Rome, General Reiner Stahel, requesting that the arrests be halted, otherwise the pope would take a position in public against the arrests and the German occupiers. Ambassador Weizsäcker argued that he had <b>chosen</b> <b>this</b> ruse because Hitler might have reacted against the Vatican and the Pope if it had been the German embassy conveying the warning, instead of the Nazi-friendly bishop. During the war Hudal sheltered victims of the Nazis at Santa Maria dell'Anima, used by the Resistance. Brigadier general John Burns, a New Zealander, gave a description of it when recalling his escape from an Italian POW-camp in 1944.|$|E
25|$|In the {{historical}} background {{to the period}} of 1696–1705, the most important political events might be the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the Test Act, and the English Settlement or Glorious Revolution of 1688–1689. Politically, the English had suffered a Civil War that had culminated with the beheading of the king, years of the Interregnum under the Puritan, Oliver Cromwell, and then Parliament inviting the king back to rule in 1660. Upon Charles II's death, his brother, James II of England took the throne. However, when James, a Roman Catholic, married a Roman Catholic as his second wife, the English parliament invited William of Orange to rule in his stead, forcing James to flee the country under military threat. Parliament decided {{on the way in}} which all future English monarchs would be <b>chosen.</b> <b>This</b> method would always favour Protestantism over blood line.|$|E
25|$|In the end nine {{different}} artillery systems were {{considered by the}} Norwegians, and eight bought or loaned for testing. Two guns {{were found to be}} within requirements, one 7.5cm gun from Schneider-Canet and one of the same calibre from Rheinische Metallwaren- und Maschinenfabrik in Germany. After extensive testing under varied conditions, both summer and winter, during the years 1899-1901, and modifications of the artillery pieces to Norwegian specifications, the Ehrhardt 7.5cm Model 1901 was chosen. The tests were carried out by the Field and Mountain Artillery School, and included a march across the Dovrefjell mountains to Stjørdal in Nord-Trøndelag. The Norwegian Ministry of Defence, now under the leadership of Georg Stang, chose the artillery system over protests from the opposition Conservative Party of Norway, which demanded that a new system from Krupp be tested before the new gun could be <b>chosen.</b> <b>This</b> criticism was brushed aside by the Ministry of Defence, stating that the military assessment had found the Model 1901 to be the best gun. Before the Ministry of Defence had reached its decision it tested a battery of Model 1901s against a battery of 7.5cm Schneider-Canet guns. After further testing the Model 1901 was still considered the best choice, although it was decided that further changes to the design were needed.|$|E

500|$|Many {{references}} in Arbuthnot's diary, however, are less respectful than those she accorded to the Duchess of Kent. Wellington and Arbuthnot often travelled together, and {{a visit to}} Blenheim Palace they shared in 1824 provoked a scathing entry in her journal concerning Wellington's fellow duke the 5th Duke of Marlborough, of whom she wrote: [...] "The family of the great General is, however, gone sadly to decay, and are but a disgrace to the illustrious name of Churchill, which they have <b>chosen</b> <b>this</b> moment to resume. The present Duke is overloaded with debt, is very little better than a common swindler".|$|E
