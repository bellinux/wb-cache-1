50|$|Although {{barium sulfate}} is almost {{completely}} inert, zinc sulfide degrades upon exposure to UV light, leading to darkening of the pigment.

30|$|As a conclusion, we can {{say that}} Co 3 O 4 with the average {{particle}} size of 40 nm is formed when pH is 8 to 9, and when pH increases at 10 to 11, irregular Co 3 O 4 with grains are seen and the size is averagely 30. Thus, pH has a great effect on the Co 3 O 4 formation. To achieve the optimum pH, the other experiments were done. In the other experiment, two capping agents, DDOA and oleic acid, were used to see the result; particles with oleic acid are irregular in shape and are clustered. Particle size distribution indicates that the size of the particle is 35 nm. In addition to the mentioned factors, the <b>cobalt</b> <b>salt</b> also plays an important role. It can be concluded that the morphologies of Co 3 O 4 are dependent on the anion type in cobalt salts. In other words, the anion type in <b>cobalt</b> <b>salt</b> {{plays a key role in}} the morphology of Co 3 O 4. The morphologies of Co 3 O 4 show irregular nanocubes, 45 nm in size, using Co (NO 3) 2 ? 6 H 2 O as <b>cobalt</b> <b>salt.</b> Also, in the experiment done to observe the effect of annealing temperature, it was concluded that as the annealing temperature increases from 400 ?C to 600 ?C, the intensity value of Co 3 O 4 exhibits a tendency to decrease, which can be attributed to the coalescences of grains at higher annealing temperature. As a result, it implies that the crystallinity of the Co 3 O 4 is improved at higher annealing temperatures. In conclusion of observing the effect of heat of reaction, it was seen that when the reaction was performed at temperature lower than 60 ?C, the reaction rate was very slow and the prepared sample was amorphous and agglomerated. At temperatures higher than 60 ?C, the synthesis rate is fast, but the prepared samples showed that the higher temperature causes more agglomeration and amorphous percentage of samples that is increased because, at high reaction rate, nucleation and particle growth processes are not controllable.|$|E
