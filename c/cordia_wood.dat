40|$|A {{systematic}} survey of methods to detect pests in forest nurseries before they damage plants was done. These surveys recorded {{the most important}} forest nursery pests during 18 years (from 1980 to 1998) and their geographical and temporal distribution in the principal enterprises in Cuba. Approximately a dozen insect species and three hngi species responsible for the major problems in forest nurseries in Cuba were studied. The principal insect pests are: Anomis iNita (Guer) pep. Noctuidae), a defoliator of Hibiscus elatus (blue mahoe); Anurogrillus spp. (Orthoptera, Gryllidae) a defoliator of Tabebuia angustata (white wood), Jamanea saman (raintree), Cordia gerascantbus (<b>cordia</b> <b>wood),</b> Cedrela odorata (cigar box cedar); Atta insularis (Guer) (Hym. Forrnicidae) a defoliator of Hibiscus elatus (blue mahoe), Pinus caribaea (Caribbean pine), Swietenia macrophJvl? (Honduras mahogany), Casuarina equisetfolia (horsetail beehood); Draecdoctpbala cubana (Hom. Cicadellidae) a defoliator of Euca&us sp. (Eucalyptus), Hibiscus elatur (blue mahoe), Tectona grandis (teakwood) and Samanea saman (raintree). The principal fung are Fusarium sp. (damping off) for broadleaf spp., and Lecanosticta acicola (Mycoq'daerella deamessiz) and Spbaercpsis sapinea (Diploid blight) in forest pine nurseries. The integrated management of forest pests in nurseries in Cuba is discussed. Biological control is uulized but, with few exceptions, the current management of pests relies on chemical products. Finally, the status of pes...|$|E
50|$|Cordia alliodora is one {{of several}} Cordia trees called bocote in Spanish and its wood, which has very little figure, is usually called freijo or jennywood along with that of <b>Cordia</b> goeldiana. The <b>wood</b> is used for boat decking, furniture, {{cabinetry}} and guitar/bass building luthiers and sometimes substitutes for mahogany or teak.|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} {{is considered the}} most damaging radiation to wood, affecting its properties and especially its color. The application of finishing products such as varnishes, stains and inks can minimize the action of this radiation. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of ultraviolet radiation, through artificially accelerated aging, on the color of freijó <b>wood</b> (<b>Cordia</b> goeldiana Huber) treated with “polisten” and sealer (nitrocellulose), by means of spectrocolorimetric tracking. The samples of wood were subjected to cycles of ultraviolet radiation in a photochemical reactor for 84 and 168 hours. The colorimetric parameters (L*, a*, b*, C, h*) were measured {{before and after the}} treatments. The treatment with “polisten” offered greater protection against ultraviolet radiation, yielding greater stability to the parameters. The treatment with sealer led to a greater change in color after the simulation of aging in the photochemical reactor. </p...|$|R
