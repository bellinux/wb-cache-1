40|$|There is {{consensus}} among economists that off-farm income sources {{need to be}} taken into account for analysing the economic situation of farming families. If data collection is based on accounting, the analysis can be improved by combining the well-known key figures derived from profit and loss accounts with <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>indicators.</b> These <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>indicators</b> should not only cover farm and off-farm sources, but also measure private expenditure of the family. The resulting operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> of the farm household shows the potential for investment, savings or paying off loans. Examples taken from the Swiss Farm Accountancy Data Network illustrate that total investment is covered by the operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> to a large degree, despite the relatively low performance of the farm itself. Aspects of diversity and problems of representativity {{need to be taken}} into account. 1 CHF ∪ 1. 5 €, 1 € ∪ 0. 66 CHF The “income gap”: What is the problem? 1. Family farm income is a net profit indicator derived from farm accounts. By definition it should remunerate the family’s input of unpaid labour and capital. The analysis of a time series carried out by the Swiss Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) shows that, over a long period of time, family farm income is considerably lower than private consumption. The gap even increases if calculated costs for unpaid labour and for net worth invested in the farm are taken as a reference point (average salaries of employees; average interest on long-term governmental bonds; see Figure 1). For other European countries, the results would probably be similar. As income objectives for the farming sector are an important element of the agricultural policy in most (if not all) OECD countries, the relatively low income is a common argument for maintaining or increasing public support...|$|R

This paper aims to fill this gap by developing a financial index that concentrates on <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> debt-servicing capacity, profitability and asset utilisation to evaluate the financial performance of SMEs in China. Principal components analysis and an efficiency coefficient method are used to develop the required index, using a sample of 860 Chinese firms. While shown to have a potential capacity to develop and have efficient assets management skills, the sample SMEs exhibit a relatively weak capability of generating an operating cash flow; weak capability of exploring distribution channels; limited innovation capacity; and weak profitability and capability of paying their short-term loans.

Today, India is on the world map for being a hotbed for mergers & acquisitions with transactions worth US$ 38. 1 billion (IBEF, 2015) recorded in 2014 which is a massive rise from the $ 2. 2 billion worth of M&A transactions booked in 1998. With such growth figures in the merger & acquisition scene in India, a study on the impact on performance of the acquiring firm will be of great interest to researchers as well as the industry in order to shape the future of mergers & acquisitions in India. Furthermore, as M&A activities in India can be clearly distinguished between overseas & domestic, research is required to compare the impact that each of them has on the financial performance of acquiring firms. With these research objectives in mind, the researcher examined the financial performance of the acquiring firms that made domestic & overseas acquisitions during the financial years of 2007 - 08 and 2008 - 09 by studying their financial ratios for a period of 5 years pre-merger and 5 years post-merger and comparing the same using inferential statistical tools. The researcher compared 23 financial ratios on a sample of 68 firms (36 domestic acquisitions and 32 overseas acquisitions) over a period of 10 years thereby analyzing a total of 15, 640 data points. The results suggest that while mergers & acquisitions reduce expenses and material costs of acquiring firms, there is evidence to prove that they negatively impact the profitability, liquidity, debt coverage and <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>indicators</b> of the acquiring firm and there are mixed results pertaining to the effect of merger & acquisitions on the management efficiency ratios of the acquiring firm.

In this paper, we measure and estimate {{the likelihood of a}} firm being constrained by external financing using a data set of small- and medium-sized Canadian firms.

We then estimate firm-level total factor productivity by taking into account the measured likelihood of binding financial constraint. Estimates of the coefficients for labour and capital in the structural estimation of the production function can be downward-biased if financial constraint is omitted, because production inputs are negatively correlated with the likelihood of being constrained by external financing. This in turn leads to an upward bias of total factor productivity estimates, which is about 4 per cent according to our estimation...|$|R

We also investigate the supplementary role of earnings to <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and search for a higher association of earnings with returns when <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are extreme than when <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are moderate. Similar to results on <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> our findings show that the supplementary role of earnings exists only when earnings are not extreme. Our results imply that investors and researchers should consider "both" earnings "and" <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> extremity when assessing the information content of these variables.

40|$|<b>Cash</b> <b>flow</b> {{prediction}} {{is an essential}} component of economic decision making, particularly in investment and credit evaluation. This paper examines the comparative predictive ability of earnings and operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> variables on future operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> within a developing economy’s setting. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method is used to develop regression models over the period of 2002 to 2012. Current operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> as proxy for future operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> are regressed on past one, two and three years of earnings and operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> as predictors. Results from the regression analysis reveals earnings and operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are significant in predicting future operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> but have different predictive powers with earnings providing a superior comparative predictive ability on future <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> The paper therefore concludes that earnings are a better predictor of future operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> than historical operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> itself...|$|R

This paper assumes that <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and its stability are important to commodity processors and examines methods for hedging <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> under continuous processing. Its objectives are (a) to determine how standard hedging models should be modified to hedge <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> (b) to outline the differences between <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> hedging and profit hedging, and (c) to determine the effectiveness of hedging in reducing <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> variability. A <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> hedging methodology is developed. This methodology {{is similar to that}} used for batch profit hedging. This methodology balances the daily <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> destabilizing effect of futures positions against the periodic <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> destabilizing effect of cash price changes. The resulting <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> hedges are simulated for soybean processors. These hedges are less effective than batch profit hedging. The reduction in <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> variance achieved through hedging, though small, is nonetheless statistically significant. Agribusiness, Marketing,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{discounted}} <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> valuation methods. We start {{the paper with}} the simplest case: no-growth, perpetual-life companies. Then we will study the continuous growth case and, finally, the general case. The different concepts of <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> used in company valuation are defined: equity <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> (ECF), free <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> (FCF), and capital <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> (CCF). Then the appropriate discount rate is determined for each <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> depending on the valuation method used. Our starting point will be the principle by which {{the value of a}} company's equity is the same, whichever of the four traditional discounted <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> formulae is used. This is logical: given the same expected <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> it would not be reasonable for the equity's value to depend on the valuation method. discounted <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> valuation; <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> valuation; value of tax shields; required return to equity;...|$|R
40|$|The free <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> {{hypothesis}} {{predicts that}} repurchasing firms with free <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> will have larger announcement-period abnormal returns than repurchasers {{that do not}} have free <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> We test the free <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> hypothesis by examining the announcement-period abnormal returns of repurchasing firms sorted by their available investment opportunities, as measured by the Tobin's q ratio and <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> Firms with low q (less than one) and high <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are identified as firms with free <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> We find that firms with free <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> earn significantly higher abnormal returns than all other firms. Cross-sectional regression analyses provide robust empirical support for the free <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> hypothesis even after controlling for other variables that can affect the announcement-period abnormal returns. ...|$|R
