5|$|A {{securely}} attached toddler will explore freely while the <b>caregiver</b> is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset when the <b>caregiver</b> departs, and {{happy to see}} the <b>caregiver</b> return. The anxious-ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed when the <b>caregiver</b> departs but ambivalent when the <b>caregiver</b> returns. The anxious-avoidant toddler will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent—showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns—and treat strangers {{much the same as}} caregivers with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping. Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance. On reunion with the <b>caregiver,</b> these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the <b>caregiver</b> or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is being sought. It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.|$|E
5|$|A toddler who is {{securely}} {{attached to his}} or her parent (or other familiar <b>caregiver)</b> will explore freely while the <b>caregiver</b> is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the <b>caregiver</b> departs, and is generally happy to see the <b>caregiver</b> return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create {{securely attached}} children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.|$|E
5|$|An infant's {{internal}} working {{model is}} developed {{in response to}} the infant's experience of the outcomes of his or her proximity-seeking behaviors. If the <b>caregiver</b> is accepting of these proximity-seeking behaviors and grants access, the infant develops a secure organization; if the <b>caregiver</b> consistently denies the infant access, an avoidant organization develops; and if the <b>caregiver</b> inconsistently grants access, an ambivalent organization develops.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate depression in <b>caregivers</b> of the frail elderly with tumors. Approximately 70 % of <b>caregivers</b> were depressed. This rate was higher than the rates of <b>caregivers</b> of the frail elderly with home-visiting nurse service in our previous studies (47 - 56 %). Compared with lightly burdened <b>caregivers,</b> heavily burdened <b>caregivers</b> were more likely to attend female elderly and the frail elderly who had a greater number of behavioral disturbances. Heavily burdened <b>caregivers</b> were more likely to consult with physicians within one month, to be in ill health and to be depressed than lightly burdened <b>caregivers.</b> They spent more time with the elderly as well as on physical care than lightly burdened <b>caregivers</b> while they had more family members and tended to use more kinds of social services than lightly burdened <b>caregivers.</b> <b>Caregivers</b> of the frail elderly with tumors seem to need more support. Since the role of home-visiting nurses is not only caring for the frail elderly but also supporting family <b>caregivers,</b> they should help <b>caregivers</b> making an informal caregiving network system to reduce their burden...|$|R

5|$|After {{the second}} year, {{as the child}} begins to see the <b>caregiver</b> as an {{independent}} person, a more complex and goal-corrected partnership is formed.

5|$|An infant with an anxious-avoidant {{pattern of}} {{attachment}} will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the <b>caregiver</b> departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much {{regardless of who}} is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the <b>caregiver</b> on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or {{turn away from the}} <b>caregiver</b> (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although fatigue is {{the most}} {{frequently}} occurring symptom in patients with cancer, hardly anything is known about fatigue of their informal <b>caregivers</b> and the impact fatigue might have on perceived burden with providing care. We investigated the presence of fatigue in <b>caregivers,</b> its course and the relation of fatigue severity between <b>caregivers</b> and patients. Furthermore, we explored in <b>caregivers</b> whether fatigue severity was correlated to experienced burden. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Informal <b>caregivers</b> and patients on cancer treatment in the palliative phase completed questionnaires at baseline and follow-up (6 months later). To measure fatigue severity, both groups completed the Checklist Individual Strength. Additionally, <b>caregivers</b> completed the <b>Caregivers</b> Strain Index to assess experienced burden with providing care. Descriptive analyses, paired t-tests, chi(2) -tests, Pearson's correlations and regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: At baseline 111 couples (patients and <b>caregivers)</b> participated, at follow-up 75 couples. At both time points 23 % of <b>caregivers</b> were severely fatigued. There was no significant correlation between patients and <b>caregivers</b> on fatigue. Higher fatigue in both patients and <b>caregivers</b> was correlated with higher burden in <b>caregivers</b> and over 30 % of burden {{could be explained by}} fatigue. CONCLUSION: Almost a quarter of <b>caregivers</b> of patients on active palliative treatment were severely fatigued, which figure remained stable over time. Fatigue in both patients and <b>caregivers</b> was related to caregivers' burden. This observation should be taken into account with the growing demand on <b>caregivers</b> and the increase in cancer treatment options in the palliative setting...|$|R

Among the <b>caregivers,</b> 196 (63 %) were <b>caregivers</b> of patients with dementia and 115 (37 %) were <b>caregivers</b> of patients without dementia. Forty-four <b>caregivers</b> (14. 1 %) were taking psychotropic drugs (benzodiazepines or antidepressants), and this usage was more frequent among <b>caregivers</b> of patients with dementia (p< 0. 01). Twenty-two <b>caregivers</b> of patients with dementia (11. 4 %) had used sleeping pills after beginning care, compared with only five (4. 3 %) <b>caregivers</b> of patients without dementia (p< 0. 01).

40|$|Six <b>caregivers</b> {{participated in}} a study in which {{behavioral}} skills training (BST) was used within a pyramidal training model to train a differential reinforcement of an alternative behavior (DRA) procedure.

5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the <b>caregiver</b> on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the <b>caregiver</b> by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{examined}} the features of informal end-of-life care of older {{people living in the}} community and the association between informal care characteristics and dying at home. Methods: Retrospective data were obtained from interviews and self-administered questionnaires of 56 persons who had been primary <b>caregivers</b> of older relatives {{in the last three months}} of their lives. Results: Results showed that informal <b>caregivers</b> of terminally ill older people living in the community provided a considerable amount of personal, household, and management care. Secondary informal <b>caregivers</b> and formal <b>caregivers</b> assisted resident primary <b>caregivers</b> less often than nonresident primary <b>caregivers.</b> Primary <b>caregivers</b> who felt less burdened, who gave personal care more intensively, and/or who were assisted by secondary <b>caregivers,</b> were more likely to provide informal end-of-life care at home until the time of death. Conclusions: Our study showed that informal care at the end of life of older people living in the community is complex, since the care required is considerable and highly varied, and involves assistance from secondary informal <b>caregivers,</b> formal home <b>caregivers</b> as well as institutional care. Burden of informal care is one of the most important factors associated with home death. More attention is needed to help ease the burden on informal <b>caregivers,</b> specifically with regard to resident <b>caregivers</b> and spouses. Since these resident <b>caregivers</b> were disadvantaged in several respects (i. e., health, income, assistance from other carers) compared to nonresident <b>caregivers,</b> interventions by formal <b>caregivers</b> should also be directed towards these persons, enabling them to bear the burden of end-of-life car...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the experience of family <b>caregivers</b> of patients with AIDS-related conditions in Malawi. The study used qualitative and quantitative methods. The sample was comprised of <b>caregivers</b> from rural areas as well as urban areas that included a major hospital and a non-governmental organization (NGO). Convenience sampling was used to recruit the sample. The study investigated: <b>caregivers</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions about their patients 2 ̆ 7 illness; how their roles as <b>caregivers</b> were acquired; role preparedness and role performance of caregivers; resources and support available to the <b>caregivers,</b> and satisfaction with support; whether or not <b>caregivers</b> experienced role strain; and correlations among variables. A comparison was made between the rural and urban caregivers; and between qualitative and quantitative findings. Data were analyzed by thematic analysis, t-test, chi-square and Spearman rho correlation. The findings included that role acquisition was mostly out of obligation. Mothers were a majority of <b>caregivers</b> in the rural setting while wives were a majority in the urban area. AIDS was seen as a secret disease by patients and <b>caregivers.</b> Non-disclosure of diagnosis occurred even with spouses. Education of <b>caregivers</b> by health personnel was poor, and there was no significant difference in role preparation between the rural <b>caregivers</b> and <b>caregivers</b> of patients who received healthcare at a major urban hospital. ^ The <b>caregivers</b> experienced various strains with the rural <b>caregivers</b> experiencing significantly more strain than the urban <b>caregivers.</b> Very few patients were abandoned by relatives. Although the disease itself had stigma, many <b>caregivers</b> had moral support, though not necessarily with physical care. <b>Caregivers</b> from the NGO had better support. The functions performed by rural and urban <b>caregivers</b> were similar, but the rural <b>caregivers</b> were more financially deprived. Most <b>caregivers</b> did not use any protection when touching patients 2 ̆ 7 body fluids, such as cleaning wounds. Recommendations include: the need for improved preparation of patients for homecare; promotion of sharing diagnosis with spouse and <b>caregivers</b> because of risk of transmission; promotion of homecare support groups even in rural areas.

5|$|Four {{different}} attachment classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Secure attachment is when children feel they can rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best attachment style. Anxious-ambivalent attachment is when the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the <b>caregiver</b> and does not feel reassured when the <b>caregiver</b> returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant attachment is when the infant avoids their parents. Disorganized attachment is when {{there is a lack of}} attachment behavior.|$|E

5|$|Age, {{cognitive}} growth, {{and continued}} social experience advance {{the development and}} complexity of the internal working model. Attachment-related behaviours lose some characteristics typical of the infant-toddler period and take on age-related tendencies. The preschool period involves the use of negotiation and bargaining.

50|$|Caregiving can {{actually}} provide a health advantage {{as well for}} some <b>caregivers.</b> <b>Caregivers</b> maintained higher physical performance when compared to non-caregivers. They declined less in tasks than the low-intensity <b>caregivers</b> and non-caregivers such as: walking pace, grip strength, and {{the speed with which}} they could rise from a chair. <b>Caregivers</b> also did significantly better on memory tasks than did non-caregivers over a 2-year time frame. <b>Caregivers</b> scored at the level of someone 10 years younger than them, although both groups (<b>caregivers</b> vs. non-caregivers) were both in their eighties.|$|R
40|$|The {{proportion}} of male <b>caregivers</b> is rapidly increasing. However, {{there are few}} large scale studies exploring {{gender differences in the}} burden or coping with caregiving.

There were no differences in depression, satisfaction with life, or loneliness according to caregivers' gender. Male <b>caregivers</b> had more comorbidities than females (CCI 1. 9 versus 1. 1, P< 0. 001), and the wives of male <b>caregivers</b> had a more severe stage of dementia than husbands of female <b>caregivers</b> (CDR, P= 0. 048; MMSE 14. 0 versus 17. 7, P< 0. 001). However, the mean Zarit burden scale was significantly lower among male than female <b>caregivers</b> (31. 5 versus 37. 5; P< 0. 001).

40|$|Purpose Family <b>caregivers</b> {{of people}} with {{advanced}} cancer can provide extensive support to the patient. However, the role is not well defined and their experiences are poorly understood. This study aimed to explore how <b>caregivers</b> view their role {{and the impact of}} their caregiving. Methods A symbolic interactionist framework guided the in-depth individual interviews and grounded theory methodology was used to analyse the data. A total of 17 interviews were conducted: 13 with active <b>caregivers</b> and 4 with bereaved <b>caregivers.</b> Results Three dominant codes are presented. <b>Caregivers</b> lacked role recognition, as they struggled to recognise their role existed, even though they took on extensive and challenging tasks. <b>Caregivers</b> reported substantial loss or changes to their self-identity: with some <b>caregivers</b> reporting not being able to stop thinking about caregiving and others having difficulty answering questions about themselves. <b>Caregivers</b> also demonstrated difficulty in taking a break: active <b>caregivers</b> did not consider taking a break, whereas bereaved <b>caregivers</b> retrospectively admitted needing a break but reported an inability to take one. Conclusions Caregiving is complex and extensive. People who care for those with advanced cancer are in need of intervention to provide support and assistance to them in their role.

40|$|Quality of {{life for}} <b>caregivers</b> of {{children}} with autistic spectrum disorder and/or an intellectual disability was compared to quality {{of life for}} those caring for a normally developing child. Participants were <b>caregivers</b> of children between 6 - 16 years of age who were divided into two groups: <b>Caregivers</b> of disabled children (Group 1, n = 60) and <b>caregivers</b> of normally developing children (Group 2, n = 13). The research investigated differences of overall quality of life between groups. Within Group One the influence on {{quality of life for}} <b>caregivers</b> was investigated in relation to the child's behaviour, level of support the child requires to complete activities of daily living, <b>caregivers</b> marital status, <b>caregivers</b> socio-economic level, and <b>caregivers</b> satisfaction with perceived supports. The Quality of Life Index and the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form were used to determine quality of life and problem behaviours. Results showed a difference in overall quality of life between groups. Child's behaviour was found to have a significant relationship with <b>caregiver‘s</b> quality of life. Satisfaction with perceived supports had a weak relationship to <b>caregiver‘s</b> quality of life. No statistically significant relationship was found between <b>caregiver‘s</b> quality of life and the child's activities of daily living requirements, <b>caregiver‘s</b> marital status or <b>caregiver‘s</b> socio-economic status. Quality of life for <b>caregivers</b> of developmentally disabled children was shown to be lower than the general population.

5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{proposed}} a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles. There is as yet no consensus, on this issue but {{a new set of}} practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by C.H. Zeanah and N. Boris. The first of these is disorder of attachment, in which a young child has no preferred adult <b>caregiver.</b> The proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second category is secure base distortion, where the child has a preferred familiar <b>caregiver,</b> but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, cling to the adult, be excessively compliant, or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult. The third type is disrupted attachment. Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar <b>caregiver</b> to whom attachment has developed. This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM-IV-TR classification, but further research is required. The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol. Most recently, Daniel Schechter and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.|$|E
5|$|Some {{studies of}} older {{children}} have identified further attachment classifications.
