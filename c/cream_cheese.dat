5|$|In {{the early}} summer, the Jewish harvest festival of Shavuot is celebrated.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the differences in the oxidative stability during storage of fish oil enriched <b>cream</b> <b>cheeses</b> when fish oil was added either as neat oil or pre-emulsified oil with sodium caseinate, whey protein isolate, or a combination of milk proteins and phospholipids as emulsifier. Results showed that the addition of fish oil decreased the oxidative stability of <b>cream</b> <b>cheeses</b> regardless of the addition method, especially when the cheese was stored longer than five weeks. The oxidative stability of fish oil enriched <b>cream</b> <b>cheeses</b> was highest when fish oil was added as neat oil or in a delivery emulsion prepared with a combination of milk proteins and phospholipids. Adding the fish oil in a delivery emulsion prepared with whey protein or caseinate resulted in a less oxidative stable product. It was furthermore shown that the microstructure of the <b>cream</b> <b>cheeses</b> was affected by fish oil addition, and it was suggested that the change in microstructure was partly responsible for the oxidative stability of the <b>cream</b> <b>cheeses...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s in the United States, the first {{televised}} recipe for clam dip {{appeared on the}} Kraft Music Hall show, a well-known and popular radio and television variety program that ran from 1933 to 1971. After the recipe segment aired, canned clams in New York City sold out within 24 hours. The ingredients used in this recipe were minced canned clams, <b>cream</b> <b>cheese,</b> lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt and pepper. Clam dip remained popular throughout the 1960s in the U.S., at which time prepared manufactured clam dips were available in U.S. supermarkets. As salsa became more popular among American consumers, the popularity of clam dip declined.|$|E

Some may incorporate other seafoods in addition to crab, such as imitation crab, lobster, shrimp and surimi. Additional ingredients may include mushrooms, artichoke, onion, green onion, shallot, green pepper, bread crumbs (such as panko), heavy cream and others.

5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or <b>cream</b> <b>cheese,</b> and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} of <b>cream</b> <b>cheese,</b> although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E
