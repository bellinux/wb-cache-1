25|$|Build 5728 (build date of September 17, 2006) was {{released}} on September 22, 2006 to technical beta participants. The following day, Microsoft released a 32-bit version of the build to the public, with a 64-bit version arriving on September 25. On October 1, Microsoft reached its goals for program participation and no longer offered the build to the public. In response to {{a significant amount of}} feedback from RC1 testers, 5728 contained many improvements, one of which was the inclusion of a <b>check</b> <b>box</b> in the Sound properties that allowed the user to disable the Windows Vista startup sound. The Welcome Center was also improved with new icons, eliminating the use of one icon for several different items, and all of the old icons in the User folder were replaced. With this build, Microsoft neared its goal of Vista installing in 15minutes, with some reviewers reporting that 5728 took as little as 16minutes to do a clean install. However, performing an upgrade installation from Windows XP was still slow, sometimes taking more than an hour to complete.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} some {{proposals}} made to restrict Cup regulars' participation in the now-Xfinity Series, including increasing the purse for series regulars, not awarding championship points to such drivers, forcing Cup drivers {{to start at the}} back, or restricting the number of races a Cup driver can run in the other series. In late 2010, media reports began to indicate that NASCAR would respond to the critics of [...] "claim jumping" [...] by effectively splitting {{the difference between the two}} extremes of unrestricted presence of Cup drivers and none at all. It was specifically reported that in 2011, Cup drivers would be allowed to run in the Nationwide Series, but not to compete for the series championship. This rule change was confirmed by NASCAR.com in a report on January 11, 2011. Drivers are now allowed to compete for the championship in only one of NASCAR's three national touring series in a given season. The NASCAR license application form now includes a <b>check</b> <b>box</b> requiring drivers to select the series in which they wish to compete for the championship. NASCAR president and CEO Brian France officially announced this change on January 26, adding that Cup Series drivers will still be allowed to earn owner's points, but not driver's points, in the Nationwide and Truck Series.|$|E

50|$|When Sun Microsystems first {{released}} Java in 1995, AWT widgets {{provided a}} thin {{level of abstraction}} over the underlying native user-interface. For example, creating an AWT <b>check</b> <b>box</b> would cause AWT directly to call the underlying native subroutine that created a <b>check</b> <b>box.</b> However, a <b>check</b> <b>box</b> on Microsoft Windows is {{not exactly the same}} as a <b>check</b> <b>box</b> on Mac OS or on the various types of Unix. Some application developers prefer this model because it provides a high degree of fidelity to the underlying native windowing toolkit and seamless integration with native applications. In other words, a GUI program written using AWT looks like a native Microsoft Windows application when run on Windows, but the same program looks like a native Apple Macintosh application when run on a Mac, etc. However, some application developers dislike this model because they prefer their applications to look exactly the same on every platform.|$|E

Additional controls can be built using SOM and distributed as [...]DLL files; anything from simple variants of existing controls (such as a tri-state <b>check</b> <b>box,</b> or a self-validating entry field) to completely custom-drawn controls (for example, a self-contained tic-tac-toe board) can be written in C, compiled, and added to a VX-REXX project.|$|E

40|$|Background: In Parkinson’s disease (PD), {{the effects}} of dopaminergic {{medication}} on straight walking and turning were mainly investigated under single tasking (ST) conditions. However, multitasking situations are considered more daily relevant. Methods: Thirty-nine early to moderate PD patients performed the following standarized ST and dual tasks (DT) {{as fast as possible}} for one minute during On- and Off-medication while wearing inertial sensors: straight walking and turning, <b>checking</b> <b>boxes,</b> and subtracting serial 7 s. Quantitative gait parameters, as well as velocity of the secondary tasks were analyzed. Results: The following parameters improved significantly in On-medication during ST: gait velocity during straight walking (p= 0. 03); step duration (p= 0. 048) and peak velocity (p= 0. 04) during turning; velocity of <b>checking</b> <b>boxes</b> during ST (p= 0. 04) and DT (p= 0. 04). Velocity of <b>checking</b> <b>boxes</b> was the only parameter that also improved during DT. Conclusion: These results suggest that dopaminergic medication does not relevantly influence straight walking and turning in early to moderate PD during DT...|$|R
