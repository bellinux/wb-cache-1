50|$|The air was foul with afterdamp. As {{the rescuers}} {{started to move}} into the {{affected}} area the canaries carried were overcome almost at once. The afterdamp led to the deaths of a further two men, bringing the total deaths to 83. John Young Wallace (26) was part of a group travelling along the west materials road when he sat down, fell unconscious and died. All the group were using self-contained breathing apparatus with nose clips and mouthpieces. Wallace's set was tested and found to be satisfactory. Post mortem examination revealed emphysema and it was thought that breathlessness caused him to open his mouth and allow atmospheric air to leak in. The air at that point was thought to contain about 3% carbon monoxide. Three days later another rescuer, H Burdess, collapsed in a similar way and died. The post-mortem revealed bullus emphysema. One bulla (blister) on the left lung had ruptured, leading to pain, a partial <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> and consequent difficulty breathing. The symptoms were though to have led to the man gasping for breath and thereby drawing in a lethal dose of carbon monoxide.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>the</b> {{exchange}} <b>of</b> gases between <b>the</b> {{blood and}} airspace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> is independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> gas {{to and from}} <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> enough oxygen can be delivered to the circulation even {{if a person is}} apneic. With <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> apnea, low pressure develops in <b>the</b> airspace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> because more oxygen is absorbed than CO2 is released. With the airways closed or obstructed, this will lead to a gradual <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> However, if <b>the</b> airways are open, any gas supplied to the upper airways will follow the pressure gradient and flow into <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> to replace <b>the</b> oxygen consumed. If pure oxygen is supplied, this process will serve to replenish the oxygen stored in <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> <b>The</b> uptake <b>of</b> oxygen into <b>the</b> blood will then remain at the usual level and <b>the</b> normal functioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organs will not be affected.

50|$|ARDS {{is a form}} of noncardiogenic {{pulmonary}} edema provoked by an acute injury to <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> that results in flooding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs' microscopic air sacs responsible for <b>the</b> exchange <b>of</b> gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide with capillaries in <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> Additional common findings in ARDS include partial <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> (atelectasis) and low levels <b>of</b> oxygen in <b>the</b> blood (hypoxemia). However, in ARDS, these changes are not due to heart failure. The clinical syndrome is associated with pathological findings including pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). <b>Of</b> these, <b>the</b> pathology most commonly associated with ARDS is DAD, which is characterized by a diffuse inflammation <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> tissue. <b>The</b> triggering insult to the tissue usually results in an initial release of chemical signals and other inflammatory mediators secreted by local epithelial and endothelial cells.|$|R

5000|$|Percutaneous image-guided {{ablation}} is a {{minimally invasive}} treatment that can be offered to patients with early stage NSCLC or for palliative treatment for patients with metastatic disease. There are various types of ablation used for treating lung malignancies including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation, and microwave ablation. Thermal ablation is typically recommended for patients who are higher risk surgical patients due to cardiopulmonary disease. Ablation is generally a lower risk procedure compared to surgery; it requires only local anesthesia and sometimes conscious sedation, and it is minimally invasive. The procedure is performed by interventional radiology in an outpatient setting. Under CT or ultrasound guidance, a probe is advanced through the anesthetized skin until {{the tip of the}} probe is positioned within the tumor. Extreme temperature is then created through electrical current (radiofrequency ablation and microwave ablation) or gas (cryoablation), which triggers destruction of the cancerous cells. Major complications are uncommon, but include partial <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> and hemothorax. [...] While there is growing evidence supportive of ablation as treatment for NSCLC, high rates of local recurrence and new metastatic disease in the treatment areas leads to reliance on more traditional treatment modalities. The pitfalls of ablation stem from the lack of complete and homogenous destruction of tumor cells, often leading to residual malignant cells {{on the periphery of the}} tumor. For that reason, lesions greater than 5 cm should be excluded, and lesions [...] should be considered with caution, given high risk of recurrence. Additionally, for safety reasons, lesions less than [...] from the trachea, main bronchi, esophagus and central vessels should be excluded from RFA, given high risk of complications and frequent incomplete ablation. [...] An animal tumor model demonstrated improved survival after combined treatment with RFA and radiation therapy compared to either treatment alone. It is possible that the two modalities have a synergistic effect and patients may benefit from combined treatment.|$|E

40|$|Aim: to {{establish}} {{the structure of the}} relationship between the change in regulations of fluorographic regimen and frequency of occurrence of bacillary excretion (MBT+), destructive forms of the disease in patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis. Materials and Methods. 1, 428 cases with newly diagnosed tuberculosis — a form № 089 u-tub, as well as other types of reports of the Saratov region have been analyzed. Statistical analysis has been performed by computer software «Microsoft Excel» and «Statistica- 6. 0 ». Analysis of the data by the test of Kolmogorov — Spirin has showed normality of their distribution. Confidence index was assessed by Student's. Differences were assessed as valid if the probability was 95 % (P< 0. 05) and higher. Results. The group with the presence of medical and biological risk factors for tuberculosis, for one reason or another do not pass a fluorographic examination in the next 3 - 5 years, the number of patients with the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> tissue was 45. 2 %, the MBT+ — 45. 7 %.

A similar trend was observed in the groups of patients with other risks for tuberculosis. Conclusion. Parameters of a regression between the periodicity of fluorographic examination and frequency of decay occurrence and bacillary excretion in patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis have been defined. It has been established that an increase in the multiplicity of fluorographic examination among those with no risk factors for ТВ to 1 time per year reduces the incidence of smear- 10. 1 % of patients with the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> tissue by 7. 3 %...|$|E
