5000|$|October 2010: Nigerian {{authorities}} seized 13 shipping containers carrying illegal Iranian weaponry at Lagos' Apapa Port. The containers included 107 mm artillery rockets (Katyushas), {{explosives and}} rifle ammunition. The arms {{were to be}} shipped next to The Gambia, with the final destination of the cargo possibly the Gaza Strip. MV CMA CGM Everest originally picked up the containers from the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. CMA CGM {{said it was the}} victim of a false <b>cargo</b> <b>declaration,</b> claiming the weapons were shipped in packages labeled as [...] "glass wool and pallets of stone" [...] and that the Iranian shipper [...] "does not appear on any forbidden persons listing".|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Ryckmans and Lieutenant General Paul Ermens {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} sending an expedition to Italian East Africa with the South African and British military missions in LÃ©opoldville. There were two problems with such an undertaking: Italian territory was thousands of kilometers away and Belgium was not at war with Italy. The Belgian government in exile was wary of declaring war on a country whose royal family had dynastic links with its own, though this attitude changed after it became known that Italian aircraft based in occupied Belgium were attacking Britain and when an Italian submarine sank a Belgian <b>cargo</b> ship. A <b>declaration</b> of war was eventually delivered on 23 November 1940. Two days later, Ryckmans proclaimed that {{a state of war}} existed between Italy and the Congo.|$|R
50|$|Under {{international}} law, {{the citizens}} of neutral nations are entitled to trade, at their own risk, with any or all powers engaged in war. No duty to restrain contraband trade is imposed on the neutral governments, but no neutral governments {{has the right to}} interfere on behalf of citizens whose property is seized by one belligerent if it is in transit to another. The penalty traditionally imposed by belligerents on neutral carriers engaged in commercial traffic with the enemy consists of confiscation of <b>cargo.</b> By the <b>Declaration</b> of London, it was extended to include condemnation of the carrying vessel if more than half the cargo was contraband. The right of warring nations to sink neutral ships transporting contraband is not recognized in international law, but the practice was initiated by Germany in World War I and was often resorted to by the Axis Powers in World War II.|$|R
40|$|Misdeclaration of {{container}} weights {{have long}} been a pronounced problem within the maritime shipping industry. As a result of accidents that have occurred at sea, where inaccurate <b>cargo</b> weight <b>declaration</b> has been deemed a strong contributing factor, the UN:s maritime body, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), has established new amendments to the already existing SOLAS- convention. The amendments states that a verified gross mass (VGM) value must be declared for every container being loaded on to a ship. The new VGM-directives were implemented on the 1 st of July 2016 in all the countries which have ratified the convention, among those Sweden. These new directives are the first issued by the IMO which are aimed at the shipper directly. The purpose of the new regulations {{is to increase the}} maritime safety at sea and during cargo operations. This report aims to investigate if the purpose behind the new amendments has been achieved in Sweden, and how the new regulations have affected the operations of concerned actors in the container shipping industry. It has been investigated how, and to what extent, the actors of the industry have been forced to adapt their operations to the new regulations, how their work routines has changed and their opinion of the outcome of the implementation of the new regulations in Sweden. Furthermore, the authors have investigated how the Swedish implementation process was performed and how the international regulations have been interpreted and established in Swedish law. The authors base the report primarily on interviews with individuals with several years of experience and with a considerable foundation of knowledge. These individuals are all parts of different actors along the transport chain, who operates in the Gothenburg area. Based on this method of gathering data, the writers have gained both up to date- and detailed primary data which they have used as a foundation when writing this report. This data is furthermore the source for what they have based their discussion part on, and later made the conclusions based on this information. The report will assess the current business environment of the concerned actors, and how these new regulations have forced the commercial actors to adapt their businesses and change their everyday work routines. Furthermore, the report will show that the overall opinion regarding these new regulations have been positive, even though the majority of the actors have had some concern and criticism directed towards the responsible governmental body and the way they have handled the implementation of the new regulations in Sweden...|$|R
