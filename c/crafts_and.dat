40|$|The {{research}} {{is based on}} a comparative study of <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> technology education curriculums and students’ attitudes towards <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> technology in Finland and Slovenia. The study was undertaken by the Helsinki University and University of Ljubljana during years 2013 - 2015. A literature review was completed, in order to examine <b>and</b> compare the <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> technology education curriculums in Finland and Slovenia. In addition, a quantitative survey was subsequently distributed to 505 school students in Finland and Slovenia. The questionnaire consisted of 14 questions, which aimed to ascertain students’ attitudes towards <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> technology. The survey showed substantial differences in students’ attitudes towards <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> technology education in the two countries: these differences may be explained by differences in the national curriculums, the different pedagogical traditions and cultural differences in the field of technology. However, for deeper understanding, the quantitative findings need to be examined further with different research methods...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an {{empirical}} {{study of the}} practice of <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> design [slöjd] in the Swedish comprehensive school. The aim has been to make an indepth study of <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> design activities and the significance of <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> design as a social practice in school. Since <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> design as a social practice is largely an unexplored field of research, my primary aim has been to describe and analyse the activities which constitute <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> design in school. The study was carried out {{over a period of time}} to be able to describe in greater detail the work in the classroom. The data consist of video recordings, notes based on observations, pupils’ and teachers’ diary notes and parent questionnaires. What pupils do and how they act are studied by observing authentic <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> design activities and having pupils, teachers and parents write about these activities. The data have been analysed partly at a micro level and partly at a more overall level over a period of time. The sociocultural frame of reference has been employed to describe <b>and</b> express <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> design activities in words. The results are shown together with transcribed excerpts of video recordings and quotations from diaries and are divided into four themes: interaction; verbal and non-verbal tools; artifacts such as, equipment and machines, sketches, pictures, drawings and instructions; and materials, objects, aesthetic <b>and</b> emotional experiences. <b>Craft</b> <b>and</b> design is characterised by comprehensive linguistic and non-verbal interaction. Pupils solve problems through social interaction, even though they work on their own objects. They learn from each other by observing and acquainting themselves with activities and gradually becoming familiar with the work by taking turns in assuming the role of being knowledgeable. The excerpts included in the study exemplify how the pupils try to find ways of coping with and solving new situations by communicating verbally and nonverbally, by means of body language, gestures, facial expressions and actions. One of the main impressions given by the analyses is that <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> design is very much a communicative subject. Inspiration <b>and</b> impressions during <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> design lessons are determined to a large degree by the pupils’ everyday life outside school. During <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> design lessons, physical tools mediate and structure the pupil’s actions. Also, mental and physical tools are integrated when the pupils work on transforming different materials into objects. Ideas and imagination are formed while working with the materials. During the <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> design lesson, the pupils practise interpreting texts and pictures by learning to see the relation between an imagined object <b>and</b> a model. <b>Craft</b> <b>and</b> design activities are characterised by the fact that several abstraction processes and standpoints are coordinated. The borderline between conceptual knowledge and physical practice becomes blurred. The results show clearly that <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> design is a communicative and reflective subject where children and young people meet in an environment where they are confronted by a number of both abstract and concrete challenges.

5|$|After the Fatimid caliphs {{moved to}} Egypt, el-Mansuriya {{remained}} {{the capital of}} the Zirids, who became the local rulers, for the next eighty-five years. The Zirid ruler el-Mansur bin Buluqqin built a palace for himself at el-Mansuriya. There is a record of the lavish marriage in 1022-23 of his grandson, the young Zirid el-Muizz bin Badis. Pavilions were built outside the city, a large array of textiles and manufactured good was displayed and music was provided by a great number of instruments. El-Muizz bin Badis, who ruled Ifriqiya under the Fatimids from 1015 to 1062, rebuilt the Kairouan city wall and built two walls {{on either side of the}} road from Kairouan to el-Mansuriya. He ordered the transfer to el-Mansuriya of the <b>crafts</b> <b>and</b> commerce from Kairouan.|$|E
5|$|Arable farming {{grew in the}} High Middle Ages and {{agriculture}} entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century. Unlike England, Scotland had no towns dating from Roman occupation. From the twelfth century there are records of burghs, chartered towns, which became major centre of <b>crafts</b> <b>and</b> trade. There are also Scottish coins, although English coinage probably remained more significant in trade, and {{until the end of}} the period barter was probably the most common form of exchange. Craft and industry remained relatively undeveloped before the end of the Middle Ages and, although there were extensive trading networks based in Scotland, while the Scots exported largely raw materials, they imported increasing quantities of luxury goods, resulting in a bullion shortage and perhaps helping to create a financial crisis in the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, Varanasi {{experienced}} a cultural revival under the Mughal emperor Akbar who patronised the city, and built two large temples dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu, though much of modern Varanasi was built during the 18th century, by the Maratha and Brahmin kings. The Kingdom of Benares was given official status by the Mughals in 1737, and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947. The city {{is governed by}} the Varanasi Nagar Nigam (Municipal Corporation) and is represented in the Parliament of India by the current Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, who won the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 by a huge margin.

30|$|Although {{the best}} fitting model {{suggests}} that job <b>crafting</b> <b>and</b> autonomy support are both important factors predicting workplace well-being, {{it is also}} possible that there is a synergistic association, such that the highest levels of well-being occur when both job <b>crafting</b> <b>and</b> autonomy support are present. We explored this possibility in two ways. First, we estimated three linear regressions, predicting PA, NA, and job satisfaction from job <b>crafting,</b> autonomy support, <b>and</b> the interaction of the two. The interaction term was computed by multiplying the centered composite job <b>crafting</b> (JC) <b>and</b> autonomy support (AS) predictor variables (Aiken and West 1991). The interaction was significant for PA (β =  0.118, p =  0.02), and non-significant for NA (β =  0.017, p =  0.77) and job satisfaction (β =  0.019, p =  0.71). This finding suggests that employees who engaged in high levels of job <b>crafting</b> <b>and</b> who perceived their managers as high on autonomy support had the highest levels of positive affect, whereas employees who engaged in the lowest levels of job <b>crafting</b> <b>and</b> who perceived their managers as low on autonomy support had the lowest levels of positive affect.|$|R
5|$|It was {{difficult}} for the few priests who had accompanied the Christian emigrants to South Canara to look after them properly. Thus, the Gurkar system came into existence. Gurkars were Mangalorean Catholic men of good moral character who were selected as headmen in Christian settlements. They were entrusted with the social and religious supervision of the community. After migration, the only possible occupation of a Mangalorean Catholic was agriculture, since they were skilled farmers. Every farmer practised carpentry, but it was quite primitive and unskilled, and other <b>crafts</b> <b>and</b> industries were non-existent. The mass was celebrated in Latin; but the sermon, the catechism, and the explication of the mysteries were delivered to the congregation in Konkani.|$|E
5|$|Known {{for more}} than a century of arts, Meridian {{contains}} many art and cultural organizations and hosts many cultural events. One of the first art organizations in the city, The Meridian Art League, was established in February 1933. Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian, but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in 1949, exhibitions were held at various locations around the city. After the Carnegie library at 25th Ave and 7th St was closed, the Art Association remodelled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits. The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults. Over thirty exhibitions are held annually, ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials, photography, <b>crafts,</b> <b>and</b> many other works of art. The collection also includes 18th and 19th century portraits, 20th century photography, and several sculptures.|$|E
5|$|The {{culture of}} the 15th century Poland can be {{described}} as retaining typical medieval characteristics. Nonetheless, the <b>crafts</b> <b>and</b> industries in existence already in the preceding centuries became more highly developed under favorable social and economic conditions, and their products were much more widely disseminated. Paper production was one of the new industries that appeared, and printing developed during {{the last quarter of the}} century. In 1473, Kasper Straube produced the first Latin print in Kraków, whereas Kasper Elyan printed Polish texts for the first time in Wrocław (Breslau) in 1475. The world's oldest prints in Cyrillic script, namely religious texts in Old Church Slavonic, appeared after 1490 from the press of Schweipolt Fiol in Krakow.|$|E
