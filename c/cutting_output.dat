40|$|The {{increase}} of cutting performance of knifes attempt {{to enhance the}} abrasion resistance of the edge, for example with coatings. Nowadays there are sporadic applications using hardened steel knifes for non-shape cutting, which use a coating of Titanium, Chromium or Titanium aluminium nitride. Thereby are friction minimizing and abrasion protection more important than cutting performance enhancement. The paper describes the results of studies with coated knives which use a super hard Diamond Like Carbon coating (DLC). The trials show that the amorphous carbon coating improves the <b>cutting</b> <b>output</b> of hardened knives. The {{research shows that the}} cutting performance of technical knives can be enhanced through coatings. The amorphous hydrogen-free carbon coating obviously improves the <b>cutting</b> <b>output</b> of hardened stainless steel knives. Coated machine-guided paper knives show a double cutting performance compared to uncoated knifes. Furthermore the tests have not been performed to the end so the difference in practice might be higher than the test results in laboratory. By the coated samples the aimed sharpness protecting effect occurs. The protection of one edge side leads to wear on the uncoated side thus minimize the widing of the edge breadth. Therefore the sharpness of th coated knife stays on longer. To achieve such good results it was very important to produce a very adhesive coating. For that reason the pre-treatment of the sample before coating has been adjusted for this special base material. The micro edged geometry and the coating properties have to be adapted for each application. An integrated view which takes all those parameters into consideration fails. Even though the results show that coatings can improve the cutting performance of hardened knives, {{further research is needed to}} understand the adhesion problems of the coatings at the small edge. The behaviour of the coated side is different to the free surfaces because of its unequal properties. The influence of the roughness and the sharping method is not scientifically defined. The effect to the coated side adhesion is not quite clear and subject of further research. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|E

The {{objective}} of this work is to present a new laboratory testing methodology suitable for estimate the forces generated during multiple blade gangsawing employed on marble and limestone. This methodology allows analysing the tool behaviour aiming to contribute for developing new products and/or optimize the working conditions for processing different classes of stones.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is {{investigation}} of fine machining efficiency of 34 CrMo 4 steel with roller burnishing tools. Application of roller burnishing process as a clean and environmentally friendly machining process which can replace other pollution processes is of great interests. It is important to evaluate the influence of material properties (primary hardness) for smoothing efficiency and achieving of lower roughness and higher work piece hardness. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental tests of <b>cutting</b> <b>outputs</b> have been done on specimens prepared for final machining process to estimate the rate of roughness decrease, and diameter increase. Roughness measured data before and after roller burnishing process have been compared. Findings: It was found that surface roughness is significantly lower after roller burnishing.

A hostile foreign oil producer cannot inflict more than a small amount of harm on Americans by refusing to sell oil to Americans, unless this oil producer is willing to cut its own output. If a hostile foreign oil producer maintains output but cuts exports to the United States, it initiates a game of musical chairs in which the number of chairs equals the number of players. Different buyers will be linked with different sellers, with a cost to Americans of only about $ 1 per person per year. The only way a foreign oil producer can harm Americans is by <b>cutting</b> <b>output,</b> but that producer will then harm itself and will also harm all oil users, not just U. S. consumers.

This institute is surrounded by vast non- fertile land area of about 200 acres, which becomes widely occupied by numerous breads of bushes and shrubs during post-rainy season. Due to this unwanted proliferation of such verdant institute gets abysmal look and that dumps off massive fund every year to get rid off it. The shrubs cutting machines comprises a main body (chassis) with two wheels and handle to provide movement in the field. One power unit (small S.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is {{investigation}} of dynamic impacts on cutting edge during machining of locally hardened steel. Alteration of hardness on a single work piece is a source of impact on tool, which could lead to breakage of cutting tool and work piece surface damage in turning. Influence of material properties (primary hardness) is important when work piece is hardened locally by induction and part of material is soft annealed. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental tests of <b>cutting</b> <b>outputs</b> have been done on specimens after induction hardening to evaluate the rate of variation of cutting forces, surface roughness and chip formation because of hardness alteration. Measured data of main cutting force were analyzed in frequency and time domain. Findings: It was found that chip formation condition, chip thickness and chip shape depends on cutting forces alteration in transition areas in the range of 10 to 15 %. Much higher alteration of force signal is recorded when machining is performed with low depth of cutting value as a result of backlash in system. The most important value of cutting force correlates with depth of cutting, and roughness correlates oppositely to the hardness. Research limitations/implications: Results and findings presented in this paper are qualitative and might be slightly different in other cutting condition (e. g. other heat treatable steels or other hardening techniques or other single cutting point processes). There is evident force value alteration in the transition (hard to soft state) zone. Practical implications: Surface roughness is a consequence of both cutting impacts and of tool/work piece loading condition. Originality/value: Originality of the paper is in analysis for stability of turning to heat treatable steel influenced with alternating work piece hardness.

Material and Methods: Surgeons' exposure characteristics was monitored during 11 surgeries (proctectomy, patency of artery, hepatectomy, cystectomy, tonsilectomy, laparoscopy) by real time of monopolar ESU activity recorder. Investigations of root-mean-square value of electric and magnetic field strength was also performed at various modes of ESU operations during <b>cutting</b> (<b>output</b> power, 55 - 150 W; frequency, 330 - 445 kHz) and coagulating (40 - 240 W, 335 - 770 kHz). Statistical parameters of distribution of ESU operation over any 6 -min periods (according to international requirements regarding protection against adverse thermal effects of electromagnetic field) were assessed. Results: Electric field strength, measured 10 cm from the cable supplying an active electrode was 147 - 675 V/m during cutting and 297 - 558 V/m during coagulating; magnetic field strength was less than 0. 2 A/m in both modes. Monitoring of ESUs showed the following ranges of their operation during surgeries 5 - 66 % of time over starting 3 min of surgery, 3 - 40 % over starting 6 min, and the distribution of their use over any 6 -min periods 0 - 12 % (median) / 7 - 43 % (maximum value). Conclusions: The real operation time of ESUs wykoduring surgeries was significantly shorter than that declared by workers. The distance of at least 15 cm between cables, connecting electrodes with generator and workers meets the requirements of the Polish legislation on permissible exposure limits.

40|$|After 1973, oil {{consumption}} stagnated worldwide. Non-OPEC output increased, mostly in Alaska, Mexico, and the North Sea, {{but not because}} of the price rise. The cartel nations had to assume the whole burden of <b>cutting</b> back <b>output</b> to maintain price. The demand for OPEC oil, the difference between total demand and non-OPEC supply, declined accordingly. From early 1974, current producing capacity much exceeded current output. The oil companies were expropriated from production. They were no longer a buffer between the OPEC nations and the market, and no longer equated the amount of crude supplied with the amount demanded. Thus it was more difficult for the cartel nations to cope with their two objectives: (1) A price and total cartel output to keep or improve total cartel revenues. (2) A division of the market acceptable to the members, {{at least for the time}} being. Each objective is difficult, both together much more so. All solutions are temporary. What is right today is wrong tomorrow. The optimal price/output combination may change, or its perception may change. Members may cheat, or the burden of restriction may become intolerably great for one or more sellers. Despite shrinking demand the loss of the oil companies as agents, the OPEC nations raised the price through 1974, and raised it more moderately through 1978. There was much dissension, which never broke unity. More price increases were expected in 1978. The demand for oil was misperceived as almost completely unresponsive to price.

The research conduct is based on the Design of Experiment (DOE) analysis. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is used in {{this research}}, {{it is one of the}} most practical and most effective techniques to develop a process model. Even though RSM has been used for the optimisation of the laser process, published RSM modelling work on the application of laser cutting process on cutting material is lacking. This research investigates laser cutting stainless steel to be best the circumstances laser cutting using RSM process. The input parameters evaluated are gas pressure, power supply and <b>cutting</b> speed, the <b>output</b> responses being kerf width, surface roughness. The laser cutting process is one of the widely used techniques to cut thickness material for various applications such as fiber, steel wood fabrication. In the area of laser cutting material,it can be improved drastically with the application of hard cutting. The application of cut on stainless steel for various machining techniques, such as bevel linear and bevel non-linear cutting, requires different cut characteristics, these being highly dependent on the process parameters under which they were formed. To efficiently optimize and customize the kerf width and surface roughness characteristics, a machine laser cutting process model using RSM methodology was proposed...|$|R
40|$|KEY WORDS: Remote Sensing, GIS, Multicriteria and Landslide. Landslide is {{a sudden}} {{downward}} movement of rock or soil mass movements on slopes {{with or without}} true sliding. This sudden movement of slope forming material causes extensive damage to life and property. When a landslide occurs in an active communication network like Highway, Railways, etc., {{the results will be}} catastrophic. The Konkan Railway alignment was made mostly (28 % of total length) in deep Rock, Rock Soil cuttings which are underlain by traps. During rainy seasons these steep slopes without toe support, failure are occurred frequently. The common types of failures are boulder falls, slides and slump etc., which damages the railway track structure. Few occasions, it lead to fatal train accidents. Many times accidents due to landslides were averted by the active warning systems like Inclinometers, Boulder nets, Raksha Dagha unit, ACD systems but the vulnerability to slope failures still exists. So, it is necessary to implement suitable permanent site-specific control measures for the vulnerable cuttings to avoid any failures in the future. An area of 163. 6 sq. km is taken for the study in which nearly 22 km of Konkan railway alignment passes through number of cuttings, bridges and tunnels. The landslide hazard zonation is prepared by using Multicriteria analysis in ARC MAP-GIS software by preparing various thematic maps like soil, geology, geomorphology, drainage density, slope and land use etc. The output map is used to monitor and to implement the slope protection measures in the railway <b>cuttings.</b> The final <b>output</b> map contains landslide hazard zonation classes like High hazard, Medium Hazard and Low hazard, which gives the possibility of landslide occurrence in relative terms. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to make an {{experimental}} impact assessment of parameters pertaining to blank two-dimensional circular blank motion on intensity of its cutting {{and quality of the}} machined surfaces. Experimental data have been obtained that reveal efficiency in application of blank circular motion and improvement of its <b>output</b> <b>cutting</b> indices. A methodology has been developed for execution of comparative experimental investigations on cutting glass, nephrite and jasper specimens as under conventional conditions required for the operation so while transferring induced oscillations to boom suspension assembly that ensure specimen. The proposed methodology makes it possible to assess quantitatively intensity of specimen cutting and quality of its machined surface. The paper has shown that a positive impact of the specimen circular motion on quality improvement of its cross-cut surface is related to peculiar kinematics features pertaining to relative motion of disc side surface with cross-cut portions of the specimen surface. It has been shown that the intensifying impact of the specimen circular motion on the cutting process is primarily related to the changes in dynamic conditions of its interaction with the cutting edge of the disc. In contrast to conventional cutting when the process is going on under static pressure of contacting surfaces there is their periodical impact-frictional interaction due to transfer of circular motion to the specimen along elliptical trajectory. In this case the rate of the positive impact of the specimen circular motion on its cross-cut surface becomes higher while increasing vertical velocity component that concerns its sliding relative to disc side surface that is ensured by increasing oscillation frequency which is transferred to the boom suspension assembly. Moreover, the rate of positive impact of the specimen circulatory motion on the quality of its cross-cut surface becomes higher while increasing vertical velocity component of its sliding relative to disc surface. </p...|$|R
