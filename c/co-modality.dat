5000|$|The <b>co-modality</b> is {{a notion}} {{introduced}} by the European commission in 2006 {{in the field of}} the transport policy to define an approach of the globality of the transport modes and of their combinations. For the European commission the <b>co-modality</b> refers to a [...] "use of different modes on their own and in combination" [...] in the aim to obtain [...] "an optimal and sustainable utilisation of resources".|$|E
50|$|The {{transition}} from the support of intermodality and multimodality as exposed in the 2001 white paper {{to the notion of}} <b>co-modality</b> has been seen by many observers of the sector of transport as the sign of the abandonment of a policy oriented towards the development of the alternatives to the road mode.|$|E
50|$|The {{transport}} sector plays a strategic and {{major role in}} the European single market and in a fast changing economic and societal frame. Policies, technologies and behaviours must be continually adapted to new constraints, such as climate change, the diminishing supply of fossil energy, the economic crisis, the increased demand for mobility, safety and security, etc. Transport infrastructures, vehicles and vessels, modal share, <b>co-modality,</b> urban planning, energy and environment issues are the subject of extensive studies, research works and industrial innovations, conducted by universities, research institutes, companies, practitioners, and public authorities.|$|E

This paper uses simulation of an on-demand transportation scheme in which passengers and parcels can travel together to explore the benefits of <b>co-modality</b> when compared to existing schemes. It is shown that, depending on the demand, <b>co-modality</b> can provide improved experiences for both operators and passengers/customers...|$|E
40|$|<b>Co-modality</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 2006 by the European Commission, the definition was stated as “the efficient use of different transport modes {{on their own or}} in combination will result in an optimal and sustainable utilisation of resources”. The authors decided to dig deeper into the true meaning of this vaguely defined concept. Stakeholders within the transport industry were asked upon their view of <b>co-modality.</b> A few of these knew the true definition as stated by the European Commission, while the majority interpreted it as equal to intermodality or were not even aware about the concept. These results lead the authors {{to try to find out}} if the <b>co-modality</b> actually is a viable and useful concept for future development within the freight transport industry. In order to do this, the authors hypothetically suggested the inclusion of a triple bottom line model, to by some means assess and measure transport solutions. Furthermore, the authors investigated the possibility to draw parallels to philosophies of improvements, found in other industry sectors. The results out of this hypothesis was that out of economic, environmental and social aspects included in a triple bottom line model, the economic and environmental aspects linked to freight transport were extensively covered in research and business agendas, while the social aspects showed to be less considered. This made the authors obliged to put extra attention towards social aspects, with respect to freight transport. The suggested parallel to other philosophies of improvements, proved to reach consensus by stakeholders of the transport industry. By viewing <b>co-modality</b> as a philosophy of improvements, applicable to the transport industry rather than as a vaguely defined concept, the possibility of <b>co-modality</b> to reach further coherence as a useful way to develop transports in the future should increase.

40|$|The European Commission aims to {{disconnect}} mobility from its adverse effects by promoting <b>co-modality,</b> a sustainable form of transport that combines several transport modes {{within the same}} transport chain. The key is that this form of mobility {{is based upon the}} strengths of each transport mode. This thesis attempts to develop an integrated EU multimodal transport management system {{on the basis of a}} database combining road, rail, inland navigation and short sea shipping networks to provide multimodal usable routes for freight transport. It aims to assess the transport options of a company at a strategic level regarding different criteria separately such as time, cost, distance or carbon dioxide emissions by providing the best transport solutions.

40|$|ABSTRACTFostering <b>co-modality</b> and {{consequently}} reducing carbon emissions {{is a leading}} objective of the Scottish and UK governments and the wider EU and worldwide community. The achievement of such goals can be facilitated by the adoption of ICT measures within the transport systems. Over recent years, many online and mobile applications have emerged which improve the usability and attractiveness of more sustainable transport modes (such as public transport, taxis, and cycling) and can help to utilise private cars more effectively by promoting and enabling car-sharing and car-pooling. The recently completed FP 7 funded EU project COMPASS has investigated {{the impact of a}} range of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools which have the potential to improve <b>co-modality.</b> This paper discusses the results of Scotland specific modelling which demonstrates and quantifies the relative carbon/congestion reductions feasible from ICT measures to improve bus journey times and ICT measures to improve car-sharing. It may be seen that measures which act to decrease overall car usage have more impact on reduction of carbon emissions than measures to improve public transport travel-times...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This Master’s thesis {{has been}} {{conducted}} in collaboration within the section of Logistics and Transportation at Chalmers University of Technology in regards to Innovative Logistics Practices (ILP) and {{the features of the}} main projects on going across the European territory that respond to this term. Through exhaustive literature review, the specific characteristics of this type of supply chain practices have been classified and analysed {{in order to get a}} better understanding of the driver mechanisms surrounding them and what is to be done in the future to overcome existing barriers that tend to delay the implementation of these ventures. Four types of ILP have been drawn and analysed: e-Freight, <b>co-modality,</b> UFT and intralogistics. These types are contextualized in the different project ventures that deal with their type of ILP in order to identify specific drivers and barriers. A great amount of coincidences had been observed as common drivers and barriers that have been classified and discussed separately in order to better highlight the relevant aspects of each of them. Economic, social and environmental aspects can be drawn as the main responsible topics with a clear interaction with technology and stakeholders positions in the surveyed project. At Findings, the different drivers and barriers are analysed in a theoretical context with specific observations and recommendations for each type of related ILP. Last, a case study has been carried out in order to better asses which parameters affect the environmental advantages of <b>co-modality,</b> which are often regarded as the most environmental advantage. It true that economies of scale and the use of electricity entails a lower socio-environmental cost for transportation, different aspects of the transport scenarios are further discussed in order to debate critical points and the feasibility of <b>co-modality</b> in the future as socio-environmental competitive solution...|$|E

40|$|VTI has {{previously}} shown {{that there are}} socio-economic benefits of using longer and heavier road vehicles {{than the rest of}} the EU, i. e. 25. 25 metres and 60 tons are permitted. The aim of the <b>Co-modality</b> project is to investigate the consequences of using even longer and/or heavier road and railway vehicles. This first subproject aims to answer which dimensions and weight limits with regards to road and railway vehicles that the <b>Co-modality</b> project should investigate further as well as the effects. A literature review has been conducted and to capture the views of Swedish stakeholders and transportation experts, a questionnaire survey was conducted. The respondents were invited to a hearing, too. The reason for the survey was to establish which road and railway vehicles would be in demand year 2030. The results show that no extreme changes are expected and that volume capacity was requested to a further extent than weight. For road vehicles, it is mainly a question of continuing to build on the European Modular System that combines different standardised load carriers. It allows member states to have different dimensions to those in other EU countries. For railway vehicles the demand is mainly for longer trains, but also heavier. Road safety, infrastructure, congestion, environment and transportation economy are the aspects that we identified as relevant for longer and/or heavier road and railway vehicles...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide a comparison between EU and National (Member States) freight transport policies. Emphasis is given to policies aiming to increase <b>co-modality</b> and promote the sustainability of the European Freight Transport System. The results suggest that the intended Member States’ policies to a great extent are aligned with the corresponding EU policies although the degree of alignment varies among Member States and freight transport policy areas. Infrastructure investments and differences among countries in relation to transport taxes, vehicle weights, and dimensions were identified as major barriers for the development of a European Co-Modal Freight Transport System. Policies towards removing existing barriers along with standardization actions, e. g., single transport document, enhancement of the training of the freight transport and logistics personnel, and further adoption and implementation of ICT, can substantially improve the competitive position of European intermodal freight systems...|$|E

In this paper we studied the potential role three ITS applications (personalised travel information, car sharing schemes and mobile payment devices) could have in enhancing <b>co-modality</b> and decarbonising EU passenger transport. Based on a thorough review of existing and planned schemes, the mobility impacts of these ITS applications were estimated for single ‘model’ countries. To estimate the EU-wide decarbonisation potential of the options, a scaling methodology was developed, taking country specific aspects affecting {{the effectiveness of these}} schemes into account. The results of our analyses showed that particularly personalised travel information and mobile payment devices could significantly contribute to decarbonising the EU passenger transport system (1 - 3 % and 0. 5 - 1 %, respectively) although the estimated CO 2 reduction figures are rather uncertain.

The CTC model has been conceptually developed, and, empirically validated through a single case study. The findings indicate that CTC can be meaningfully modelled using the terminal metaphor. The CTC modelled as a terminal is the main outcome of this study. The CTC model provides a basis for evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of a co-modal node in the network while at the same time being able to account for more of the complexity of the real world system.

More recently, the availability of recombinant &alpha;-L-iduronidase (IDUA) {{has resulted in the}} widespread treatment of less severe forms of MPS I with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). In addition, over 50 MPS IH patients have been treated with a combination of ERT and HCT. The rationale for both ERT and HCT stems from the pivotal experiments performed 4 decades ago that showed &alpha;-L-iduronidase supplied in the environment can correct the accumulation of substrate in MPS I cells. Our purpose is to address the multiple applications associated with the therapeutic delivery of IDUA: intermittent delivery of recombinant protein (ERT), continuous administration through cellular therapy (HCT), the use of other stem cells or, potentially, correction of the enzyme defect itself through gene therapy approaches.

40|$|Transport plays {{a crucial}} role in {{economic}} and social development and its contribution goes beyond what is normally captured in traditional cost-benefit analyses. Transportation investments can have large long-term economic, social and environmental impacts. The European Commission when developing transport policy, focuses on the intermodal transport, which is seen as a sustainable mobility solution, environmentally friendly and efficient in terms of resources, especially in terms of freight. European transport policies promote <b>co-modality</b> - combining different modes for a single supply chain - as a solution to the adverse effects of transport: pollution, traffic congestion, energy consumption. Intermodal transport is found to be consistently cheaper than all-road solutions, and its external costs significantly lower, thereby confirming the high potential of intermodal transport in increasing the sustainability of the transport sector. So, freight intermodality is increasingly considered as major potential contributor to solving the sustainability problems of the European transport sector. This paper addresses the pricing issues specifically related to intermodal transport. The focus in on the main economical advantages of developing intermodal transport, but also on the usage limits brought by particularities of transport modes. Special attention is given to intermodal transfer terminals with solutions for activity efficiency increase, with major implications on the quality and cost of transportation. The theme discussed in this paper is of great importance, many authors and specialists developed it in their studies. Some names are needed to be mentioned: Todd Litman, Dr. Yuri V. Yevdokimov, John J. Coyle, Kenneth D. Boyer and few more. But, a special attention for this subject is paid by the European Commission and its subordinated institutions, that are interested in developing sustainable strategies and promoting concrete solutions for economic efficiency in the transportation field. The methodology used for this subject is based on the statistics data from the official documents and on the research made by the authors of the paper regarding the advantages from the economical point of view derived from the development of intermodal transport.

40|$|AbstractThe demand {{regulation}} for airport infrastructures is managed, {{depending on}} the location within the world, typically by slot allocation schemes. Slot allocation for the biggest part of the relevant airports is organized {{in accordance with the}} IATA Worldwide Slot Guidelines, IATA-WSG. In Europe, Regulation 95 / 93 including its amendments as local rule with relation to IATA-WSG builds the basis for airport slot allocation. Key element of the slot allocation according to this principle is the fragmentation of the declared capacity into time niches, better known as airport slots. A weak spot with this is the usage of the capacity estimation which has to cover a full scheduling season. Those having been allocated a slot are allowed {{to make use of the}} airport infrastructure in general. Demanding airlines without a slot for this airport may request spontaneously a free slot, if available. If not applicable, additional demand's requests are waived. This system limits the serviced demand and assures thereby a reliable level of service at service process stations, e. g. the runway, apron, or terminal. From a strategic point of view this capped demand may cause economic losses due to waived additional airport charges also in situations with capacity well above the average expected value, which was used to calculate the official declared capacity. A second problem with resource usage efficiency arises instead of conservative calculations regarding the available capacity by the variance in resource usage by slot holding airlines. Delayed use of infrastructure may cause excessive demand in later time frames, instead the slot allocation and its levelling effect. Knock-on delays affect the following turnarounds and may destabilize network-wide connections. Especially for the resilience of door-to-door managed networks, process stability is a key ingredient for success. Arrival and departure deviations in aviation may preclude sustainable <b>co-modality</b> by its variability. Both primary as well as secondary delays may jeopardize connections between different or same modes of transportation, and the affected passenger may be stranded at least at the mode's transfer point. By introducing an incentive to avoid primary delays and by foreclosing the propagation of secondary delays within networks, an increase in level of service like process stability or punctuality is realizable. The research topic was to evaluate possibilities to increase resource usage efficiency by changing the methods of slot allocation. Therefore, a priority-based system was created and verified by a simplified microscopic simulation model. Priorities were allocated in advance, representing different categories of resource availability estimation. A second extension to the system was given by a performance-based component. The preselected priority was allocated to the demanding aircraft with up-/downgrades depending on its own punctuality. Despite the increased data exchange volume needed to realize this resource allocation scheme in reality, benefits in resource efficiency and turnaround stability are clearly observable. Different priorities in scheduling are an incentive to schedule with different levels of availability of infrastructures already during strategic planning, whereas the vehicle-oriented performance-based prioritization in operations is suitable to avoid any secondary delay propagation and to increase the system's fairness...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSPIDER PLUS was a {{research}} and development project co-funded by the European Union in {{the scope of the}} Seventh Framework Programme (12 / 2012 – 5 / 2015). The project aimed at developing a passenger and freight mobility vision for 2050 encompassing seamless transportation where electrified rail has a central role. Within the “White Paper on Transport” the European Commission published two keywords that are essential for the prospective transport policy: sustainable mobility. That means a massive shift of traffic from road to rail. In the long-term, a rail market share of about 50 % is the set goal for both long distance rail passenger service and freight transport over 300 km. 12 European companies and institutions provided cross-modal expertise, coordinated by HaCon Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH. Leading industrial players like Siemens or EADS participated as well as market newcomers such as NTV, European universities and research companies. During the project, the interdisciplinary team was supported by a network of expertise. The results are oriented on four guiding principles that will put electrified rail at the centre of sustainable mobility:•Industrialisation of production•Offer-driven business models•Seamless and convenient services•Co-modality and sustainabilityBased on the as-is situation and internal/external drivers of change the vision components have been elaborated. Main technological tools and solutions have been identified and assessed in terms of impact and costs. The SPIDER PLUS Roadmap as final result of the project paves the way to the desired future. It describes the required infrastructure development as well as business models and funding schemes. The integration of national systems into European grid and the <b>co-modality</b> implementation in user friendly mobility environment outline the future network and access points for rail passenger and rail freight services. Within the Road Map, special emphasis is given to the intermediate step in 2030 to indicate the minimum target which is needed to reach a European society overwhelmingly served by electrified rail in 2050. All SPIDER PLUS recommendations are summarised in the interactive Solutions Guide Book which contains the 5 action fields:•Rolling Stock•Technology•Investments•Governance•Market UptakeThe Guide Book itself focused on the content and the involved actors. The Decision Support Tool as an additional part has been implemented as a dynamic and interactive Road Map considering temporal aspects, too. Essential actions and steps have been joined in a common project management software environment. Finally, this tool provides information about required steps, temporal sequence and dependencies between various actions. Decision makers in politics, industry and business are the main target group {{for the use of the}} decision support tool. It allows the creation of scenarios that show even far reaching effects of possible delays. Moreover, it illustrates which processes can be done in parallel and which processes have to be done in sequence. The indicated time slots of the various steps to be done are the framework for the fulfilment of the SPIDER PLUS vision until 2050. The key message of SPIDER PLUS is that the vision of a European society overwhelmingly served by electrified rail until 2050 is achievable if all stakeholders act targeted, jointly and now...|$|E
40|$|One of Sweden’s {{national}} climate targets is {{to lower}} the greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector by 40 % between 1990 and 2020. To meet the demand of increasing amount of transports and to fulfill the climate targets, the effects of longer and heavier trucks are being tested and evaluated. High Capacity Transports (HCT) means that the vehicles’ length and/or gross weight are allowed to increase so that each vehicle can transport more freight. The objectives are that HCT should contribute to lower transport costs, lower environmental effects, increased traffic safety, and less road wear with decreased maintenance. There are some concerns regarding HCT though, that it will affect other transport modes negatively. The main concern is that freight {{will be transferred from}} railway to truck. This master thesis examines the potential of HCT on roads and compares {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} HCT with railway. A literature review describes the development of trucks in Sweden until today and hypothetical effects of HCT in the road system as well as in the transport system as a whole, focusing on the railway market. Interviews with authority and company representatives have been performed. The thesis is focused on environmental aspects and transport economy. To enable an evaluation of HCT regarding these aspects and to be able to compare HCT with other transport alternatives, calculation schemes for transport costs and carbon emissions have been created. Comparisons between traditional truck, HCT, direct railway transport, and intermodal transport with truck and rail can be made with the calculation schemes. The calculation schemes have been applied to two case studies. Case study 1, Ett Coil Till, is a pilot project with HCT between Sölvesborg harbor and Olofström, in Blekinge. Trucks of 30 % higher gross weight than traditional trucks are tested on a distance of 34. 5 km. Comparisons of three scenarios have been made in this case; truck transport of today, HCT, and transport on railway (hypothetical alternative). Case study 2 examines the pilot project called Duo 2 between Gothenburg and Malmö, a distance of 300 km. The calculation schemes compare traditional truck transport (tractor + trailer), HCT (tractor + two trailers) and intermodal transport with trailers. The calculation schemes are not exact, but work as a simple analysis tool that can be used in an early stage of evaluation of HCT. Results of case study 1 : • HCT would lower the total transport cost for road transport with 14 %. • Carbon emissions would decrease with 17 % with HCT. • The number of heavy transports would decrease with 23 %. Results of case study 2 : • HCT would lower the total transport cost for road transport with 37 %. • Carbon emissions would decrease by 28 % with HCT. • The number of heavy transports would decrease with 50 %. The calculations also show that railway freight transport is far more environmental friendly and often has lower total transport costs than truck transport. However, the railway has difficulties to compete with the truck due to high capital expenditures, low flexibility, and lacking quality (e. g. in terms of time). The results of the 　   　 6   　 calculations show that HCT may increase the competition between truck and railway through decreased transport costs for HCT. The probability that more customers in the future will choose truck rather than railway will consequently increase, since the cost appear to be the most significant factor for the customers’ choice of transport mode. From the perspective of the road system: Regarding the results of the calculations and with the concept of <b>co-modality</b> in mind, as well as reports showing that transfer of freight from railway to truck is limited, HCT appears to be an alternative worth developing...|$|E
