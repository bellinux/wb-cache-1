Within Victoria College, one of the strongest friendships he formed was with Professor JI Marais, the head of the Theology faculty.|$|E

5|$|The {{conversion}} of major religious, {{political and social}} leaders sparked a backlash that led Ranavalona to become increasingly wary {{of the political and}} cultural effects of Christianity, which she saw as leading the Malagasy to forsake the ancestors and their traditions. In October and November 1831 the queen enacted a ban on Christian marriages, <b>church</b> <b>services</b> and baptisms for soldiers and members of government studying in the Missionary schools, and in December extended the ban on church service attendance to all Malagasy. From 1832 to 1834, baptisms and <b>church</b> <b>services</b> continued, increasingly in secret. During this time, several Christians each year were charged with witchcraft and exiled or made to undergo the tangena ordeal, and Ranavalona requested the departure of three missionaries, retaining only those whose particular technical skills she viewed as valuable to the state. In 1835, the queen attempted to shut down the press without directly targeting the LMS by banning Malagasy personnel from working at the printing house. The LMS missionaries, capitalizing on the absence of legal decrees against their own work at the press, managed to continue independently printing and distributing materials.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{language}} of the Polish population in Zaolzie is the Cieszyn Silesian dialect, with {{the vast majority of}} Poles using it in everyday communication. The dialect is very prestigious and contributes to the pride of local people. It is also used by some local Czechs. Local Poles also feel a strong regional identity. In the Zaolzie region, a few <b>church</b> <b>services</b> are conducted in Polish. 90% of worshippers among Polish secondary school students are reported to pray in Polish.|$|E
5|$|Though Western {{classical}} and other musics {{play an important}} role in Anglican <b>church</b> <b>services</b> on Barbados, religion and folk music are closely intertwined in the everyday lives of most Barbadians. The basis for religious folk music is the Anglican hymn, a kind of praise song mostly sung on Sundays, a day when Christian Barbadians come together with family members to sing and praise God to ask for strength for the next week's work.|$|E

5|$|Edgar was {{concerned}} about different interpretations of the Benedictine Rule in different monasteries in his kingdom, and wanted to impose uniform rules {{to be followed by}} all. The rules were set out in the key document of the English reform, the Regularis Concordia, which was adopted by the Council of Winchester in around 970. The Concordia was written by Æthelwold, who had sought advice from Ghent and Fleury Abbeys. A major aim of the Concordia was the regularisation of the form of <b>church</b> <b>services,</b> and Æthelwold tried to synthesise what he regarded as the best Continental and English practice.|$|E

5|$|Henry VIII died in 1547 and Edward succeeded him. Mary {{inherited}} estates in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, and {{was granted}} Hunsdon and Beaulieu as her own. Since Edward {{was still a}} child, rule passed to a regency council dominated by Protestants, who attempted to establish their faith throughout the country. For example, the Act of Uniformity 1549 prescribed Protestant rites for <b>church</b> <b>services,</b> {{such as the use}} of Thomas Cranmer's new Book of Common Prayer. Mary remained faithful to Roman Catholicism and defiantly celebrated the traditional Mass in her own chapel. She appealed to her cousin Emperor Charles V to apply diplomatic pressure demanding that she be allowed to practice her religion.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was known}} for his public demonstrations of piety, and appears to have been {{genuinely}} devout. He promoted rich, luxurious <b>Church</b> <b>services,</b> and, unusually for the period, attended mass at least once a day. He gave generously to religious causes, paid for the feeding of 500 paupers each day and helped orphans. He fasted before commemorating Edward the Confessor's feasts, and may have washed the feet of lepers. Henry regularly went on pilgrimages, particularly to the abbeys of Bromholm, St Albans and Walsingham Priory, although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as an excuse to avoid dealing with pressing political problems.|$|E
5|$|Leofric {{replaced}} the monks with canons. The new community {{was given the}} Rule of Chrodegang by Leofric, which rule he had probably learned in Lotharingia before his return to England. Leofric moved {{the seat of his}} see because Crediton was too poor and rural, and Exeter was a city with protective walls and an abandoned church that could be used as the new cathedral. Leofric claimed that he found his diocese lacking in episcopal vestments and the other items required for <b>church</b> <b>services,</b> and his surviving list of gifts to the church noted that he gave vestments, crosses, chalices, censers, altar coverings, and other furnishings to the cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Lydia wanted Richardson {{to become}} a priest. In Brighton he served as an altar boy, which he enjoyed, but when sent at about fifteen to the nearby Xaverian College, a seminary for trainee priests, he ran away. As a pupil at a series of schools he was uninterested in most {{subjects}} and was an indifferent scholar. His Latin was poor, and during <b>church</b> <b>services</b> he would improvise parts of the Latin responses, developing a talent for invention when memory failed that proved useful in his later career.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{direction}} of Mariano Datahan, the group converted en masse to the nascent Philippine Independent Church in about 1902. Community members revere the entity Suno which is conflated with the Santo Niño, {{and in addition to}} weekly <b>church</b> <b>services</b> they are served by appointed spiritual leaders known as biki and beriki. The biki, or bishop, is responsible for performing harvest ceremonies and other rituals such as house blessing. Before a house can be constructed, a ritual is performed in which a spiritual leader asks the permission of the spirits. If permission is not granted, the builder must select a new site. The Eskaya also retain spiritual traditions once widespread in lowland Boholano rural communities.|$|E

The theater's front doors and ticket office were altered by J. W. McFadden Inc. in 1930, {{along with the}} construction of a new ticket booth. In 1949, when the Waverly Heights Congregational United Church of Christ was reconstructing a new church building on its property at Southeast 33rd and Woodward, <b>church</b> <b>services</b> were held at the Oregon Theatre. According to the Puget Sound Theatre Organ Society, the organ was repossessed by the William Wood Organ Co. and re-installed at radio station KXL's studios in Portland. The theater's front entrance, including its doors and 1930s ticket booth, were remodeled by Ferguson Cassady Co. in 1954.|$|E
