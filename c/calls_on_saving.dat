The results illustrate that lower corruption is associated with higher savings, and the effect of corruption <b>on</b> <b>savings</b> decreases with income level.

40|$|After {{reaching}} its peak at {{the year of}} 1987, the saving rate of Taiwan dropped quickly in the late 1980 ’s. At the same time, the real average housing prices in Taiwan had increased almost three times from 1987 to 1990. Why did the saving rated in Taiwan drop so quickly after 1987 ? Does it relate to the dramatic increase in housing prices? Though it has been confirmed {{that there is a}} negative wealth effect of housing price appreciation <b>on</b> <b>savings,</b> the estimated wealth effect <b>on</b> <b>savings</b> could be biased if the effect of mortgage payment (also known as forced <b>savings)</b> <b>on</b> <b>saving</b> is neglected. Applying quarterly data from 1981 to 2000 in Taiwan, we employ a time series analysis to compare two saving models, the traditional one and the one with forced saving. Our major findings include: First, as we expected, the negative wealth effect of housing price appreciation <b>on</b> <b>saving</b> is smaller in the forced saving model than in the traditional saving model. Secondly, by the estimated ECMs, ignoring the impact of housing price appreciation <b>on</b> forced <b>saving,</b> the speed of short-run adjustment in total saving would be significantly slower. Third, for forecasting purpose, the forecast errors in ECM of the forced saving model are smaller than that in the total savings model...|$|R

An increasing number of people are reported to save their money in saving, fixed deposit and current saving accounts. The collection of zakat <b>on</b> <b>saving</b> is the third highest collection reported by Jabatan Zakat Negeri Kedah after zakat on employment income and zakat on trade. As such, this study is motivated to investigate zakat compliance intention <b>on</b> <b>saving</b> among employees of Universiti Utara Malaysia by using theory of planned behavior. A total of 86 questionnaires were returned and used to measure the three independent variables which are attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control towards the intention to comply with zakat <b>on</b> <b>saving.</b> Based <b>on</b> the results obtained, perceived behavioral control was found to significantly influence intention to comply with zakat <b>on</b> <b>saving,</b> but attitude and subjective norms have no significant influence at all.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} domestic saving and investment and measures the international mobility of capital in the United States. The long-run model, “with” and “without” structural breaks, is estimated using several single-equation and system estimators to assess the robustness of results and take an exhaustive account of the methodological and measurement issues. The results provide dominant support for the long-run relationship between domestic saving and investment. The estimates of the slope parameter <b>on</b> <b>saving</b> above zero and the dominant support for cointegration between saving and investment across estimators vindicate the validity of intertemporal budget constraint and suggest the sustainability of current account deficits. The numerical magnitude of the slope parameter <b>on</b> <b>saving</b> is consistently low across estimators. The results showing the low slope parameter <b>on</b> <b>saving</b> resonate with the observed high mobility of capital. The estimates of the model with structural breaks reinforce the dominant support for the long-run relationship between domestic saving and investment. The inclusion of these structural breaks in the model generally reduces the numerical magnitude of the slope parameter <b>on</b> <b>saving</b> and suggests the high mobility of capital.
