5|$|The {{invisible}} rail {{is thought}} to be monogamous, but little else is known of its <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviour</b> prior to nesting. A report of 4–5 striped chicks was long thought to be incorrect, since such a plumage is not normal for rails. In this family, chicks are typically precocial, downy and black, with any ornamentation confined to the head, bare flesh, or specially modified plume feathers.|$|E
5|$|The {{king vulture}} soars for hours effortlessly, only {{flapping}} its wings infrequently. While in flight, its wings are held flat with slightly raised tips, {{and from a}} distance the vulture can appear to be headless while in flight. Its wing beats are deep and strong. Birds have been observed engaging in tandem flight on two occasions in Venezuela by naturalist Marsha Schlee, who has proposed {{it could be a}} part of <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviour.</b>|$|E
5|$|Recorded dietary {{items include}} sago shoots and insects, {{and it also}} {{swallows}} small stones to help break up its food. It is apparently monogamous, but little else is known of its <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The only known nest was a shallow bowl {{in the top of}} a rotting tree stump that was lined with wood chips and dry leaves. The two young chicks were entirely covered in black down typical of precocial newly hatched rails. The estimated population of 3,500–15,000 birds and the restricted range mean that the invisible rail is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Habitat loss has occurred through the harvesting of sago and conversion of the wetlands to rice cultivation, and the rail is eaten by local people. The described nest was in an area frequented by local villagers, so the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought.|$|E
50|$|Post-fledging {{behaviour}} {{and development}} of young falcons appears to be {{very similar to that}} of the peregrine falcon, and includes spending time with siblings and parents, and practicing hunting, territorial and <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours.</b>|$|R
500|$|There {{are three}} known <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours</b> in bigfin reef squids, dubbed [...] "male-upturned" [...] mating, [...] "male-parallel" [...] mating, and [...] "head-to-head" [...] mating. Actual {{insertion}} in each position lasts {{for only a}} few seconds.|$|R
50|$|It is monogamous and territorial. Some <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} with a pair chasing each other through a bush, leaping from branch to branch and emitting metallic twanging sounds. The deep cup-shaped nest is often flimsy and is built in a bush, from rootlets and tendrils. Two, or occasionally three, greyish-green or bluish-green eggs with dark spots are laid.|$|R
5|$|Cheetahs breed {{throughout}} the year; they are induced ovulators. Females become sexually mature at 21 to 22 months of age. Females are polyoestrusthey have an oestrus ("heat") cycle every 12days (this {{can vary from}} 10to 20 days), each oestrus lasting one to three days. A female can give birth again after 17 to 20 months; however, on {{the loss of a}} whole litter mothers can mate again. Urine-marking in males becomes more pronounced when a female in their vicinity comes into oestrus. Males fight among one another to secure access to the female; even males in a coalition may show some aggression toward one another on approaching a female. One male eventually wins dominance over the others. Mating, observed mainly at night, begins with the male approaching the female, who lies down on the ground. No <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviour</b> is observed; the male immediately secures hold of the female's nape and copulation takes place. The pair then ignore each other and part ways. However, they meet and copulate a few more times within the next few days. Polyandrous, females can mate with several males. The mean number of motile sperm in a single ejaculation is nearly 25.3million.|$|E
5|$|Having {{spent the}} winter {{alone on the}} ocean, {{it is unclear whether}} the Atlantic puffin meets its {{previous}} partner offshore or whether they encounter each other when they return to their nest of the previous year. On land, they soon set about improving and clearing out the burrow. Often, one stands outside the entrance while the other excavates, kicking out quantities of soil and grit that showers the partner standing outside. Some birds collect stems and fragments of dry grasses as nesting materials but others do not bother. Sometimes a beakful of materials is taken underground, only to be brought out again and discarded. Apart from nest-building, the other way in which the birds restore their bond is by billing. This is a practice in which the pair approach each other, each wagging its head from side to side, and then rattle their beaks together. This seems to be an important element of their <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviour</b> because it happens repeatedly, and the birds continue to bill, to a lesser extent, throughout the breeding season.|$|E
25|$|Basking {{sharks are}} usually solitary but during summer months in {{particular}} they aggregate in dense patches of zooplankton where {{they engage in}} social behaviour. They can form sex-segregated shoals, usually in small numbers (three or four), but reportedly up to 100 individuals. Their social behaviour in summer months has been studied and is thought to represent <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviour.</b>|$|E
5|$|Various <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} among mecopterans, with males often emitting pheromones to attract mates. The male may provide an edible gift such as a dead insect or a brown salivary secretion to the female. Some boreids have hook-like wings which the male uses {{to pick up and}} place the female on his back while copulating. Male panorpids vibrate their wings or even stridulate while approaching a female.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with all}} stork species, male yellow-billed storks select and occupy {{potential}} nest sites in trees, whereupon females attempt {{to approach the}} males. The yellow-billed stork has an extensive repertoire of <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours</b> near and at the nest {{that may lead to}} pair formation and copulation. Generally, these <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours</b> are also assumed to be common to all Mycteria species and show remarkable homology within the Mycteria genus. After the male has initially established at the nesting-site and the female begins to approach, he displays behaviours that advertise himself to the her. One of these is the Display Preening, whereby the male pretends to strip down each of his extended wings with the bill several times each side [...] and the bill does not effectively close around the feathers. Another observed display among males is the Swaying-Twig Grasping. Here, the male stands on the potential nesting-site and bends over to gently grasp and release underlying twigs at regular intervals. This is sometimes accompanied by side-to-side oscillations of the neck and head and he continues to pick at twigs in between such movements.|$|R
500|$|Several <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{have been}} {{recorded}}. Males {{have been recorded}} feeding females. A male flame robin either lands next to and moves a female off her perch, or flies in front of her. Courting males also run to and fro {{in front of a}} female, in a crouch with wings and head lowered and hiding their breast feathers. In both displays, the male proceeds to chase the female. Pairs are generally monogamous, and remain together unless one bird perishes, although [...] "divorces" [...] have been recorded.|$|R
25|$|Territorial {{behaviour}} {{is generally}} necessary for guarders, and the embryos {{are almost always}} guarded by males (apart from cichlids). There {{is a need to}} be territorial because looking after embryos usually includes defending the site where they are being looked after. It also often means there is competition for the best egg-laying sites. Elaborate <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviour</b> is usual among guarders.|$|E
25|$|The cock {{performs}} {{with his}} wings, alternating wing beats, until he attracts a mate. They {{will go to}} the mating area and he will maintain privacy by driving away all intruders. They graze until their behaviour is synchronized, then the feeding becomes secondary and the process takes on a ritualistic appearance. The cock will then excitedly flap alternate wings again, and start poking on the ground with his bill. He will then violently flap his wings to symbolically clear out a nest in the soil. Then, while the hen runs a circle around him with lowered wings, he will wind his head in a spiral motion. She will drop to the ground and he will mount for copulation. Common ostriches raised entirely by humans may direct their <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviour</b> not at other ostriches, but toward their human keepers.|$|E
25|$|Dr Heather Proctor (formerly at the University of Toronto, {{now at the}} University of Alberta) {{studied the}} <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviour</b> of Neumania papillator, and noticed that male leg {{trembling}} caused females (who were in the 'net stance') to orient towards and then often clutch the male. This did not damage the male or deter further courtship; the male then deposited spermatophores and began to vigorously fan and jerk his fourth pair of legs over the spermatophore, generating a current of water that passed over the spermatophores and towards the female, for about 60 seconds. Sperm packet uptake by the female would sometimes follow. Proctor hypothesised that the vibrations the trembling male legs made were done to mimic the vibrations that females detect from swimming prey - this would trigger the female's prey-detection response causing females to orient and then clutch at males, mediating courtship. If this was true and males were exploiting female predation responses, then hungry females should be more receptive to male trembling - Proctor found that unfed captive females did orient and clutch at males significantly more than fed captive females did, consistent with the sensory exploitation hypothesis. Further evidence for the sensory exploitation hypothesis resulted from a cladistic analysis comparing 28 characters between other water mites of the family Unionicolidae and identified the most likely evolutionary scenario (the fewest number of reversal of character states and the fewer parallel evolution of character states (homoplasies)) for the origin of both the trembling behaviour and the 'net stance'. If male courtship trembling behaviour only ever evolved after the net stance evolved in the species analyzed, then this {{support the idea that}} trembling was an exploitation of a preexisting female sensory system. The cladograms generated showed two equally plausible evolutionary histories: the 'net stance' and trembling either evolved concomitantly in the common ancestor of Neumania and Unionicola (a closely related mite in the same family (confamilial)) or net stance evolved and then trembling evolved twice afterwards. The former scenario is ambiguous and is not evidence for or against the sensory exploitation hypothesis, whilst the latter supports it.|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} {{relies on}} the recognition of conspecifics for breeding. Most experiments in birds have implicated a critical role for early social learning in directing subsequent <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours</b> and mating decisions. This classical view of avian sexual imprinting is challenged, however, by studies of megapodes and obligate brood parasites, species in which reliable recognition is achieved {{despite the lack of}} early experience with conspecifics. By rearing males with either conspecific or heterospecific brood mates, we experimentally tested the effect of early social experience on the association preferences and <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours</b> of two sympatrically breeding ducks. We predicted that redheads (Aythya americana), which are facultative interspecific brood parasites, would show a diminished effect of early social environment on subsequent courtship preferences when compared with their host and congener, the canvasback (Aythya valisineria). Contrary to expectations, cross-fostered males of both species courted heterospecific females and preferred them in spatial association tests, whereas control males courted and associated with conspecific females. These results imply that ontogenetic constraints on species recognition may be a general impediment to the initial evolution of interspecific brood parasitism in birds. Under more natural conditions, a variety of mechanisms may mitigate or counteract the effects of early imprinting for redheads reared in canvasback broods...|$|R
25|$|Like most birds the pittas are monogamous breeders, {{and defend}} {{breeding}} territories. Most species are seasonal breeders, timing their breeding to {{occur at the}} onset of the rainy season. An exception to this is the superb pitta, which breeds almost year-round, as the island of Manus which it breeds on remains wet all year. The <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours</b> of the family are poorly known, but the elaborate dance of the African pitta includes jumping into the air with a puffed out breast and parachuting down back down to the perch.|$|R
40|$|Mating {{behaviour}} in the crusader bug, Mictis profana (Heteroptera: Miridae) is described. Using scan {{samples of}} marked individuals in outdoor enclosures, it is shown that larger males secure more matings than do small males. From videotaped recordings of captive individuals, {{a series of}} stereotyped male <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours</b> are documented, which appear to {{include the use of}} a putative weapon - the median abdominal tubercle - in tactile stimulation of the female. The fighting behaviour of this species based on videotaped observations of male-male combat over access to females was also described. 5 page(s...|$|R
500|$|Wallace's main criticism, occupying {{half his}} lengthy review, was of Poulton's {{acceptance}} of sexual selection. He begins by stating [...] "Mr. Poulton fully accepts Darwin's theory of female choice {{as the source}} of the greater part of the brilliant colour, delicate patterns, and ornamental appendages that exist among animals, and especially among birds and insects." [...] Wallace then cites Poulton on the <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviour</b> of spiders: ...|$|E
500|$|One {{possible}} {{advantage to}} lek formation in Guianan cock-of-the-rock is severe selection and consequent rapid evolutionary advancement, {{all of which}} is possible due to the high expendability of males. Only a few males are needed to fertilize the next generation. [...] The <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviour</b> is similarly theorized to have arisen from differences in division of labour between the two sexes. Females expend their energy on building nests and rearing young, while males {{spend most of their time}} and energy of finding mates and caring for their plumage.|$|E
500|$|Birds {{have evolved}} {{a variety of}} mating behaviours, with the peacock tail being {{perhaps the most famous}} example of sexual {{selection}} and the [...] Fisherian runaway. Commonly occurring sexual dimorphisms such as size and colour differences are energetically costly attributes that signal competitive breeding situations. Many types of avian sexual selection have been identified; intersexual selection, also known as female choice; and intrasexual competition, where individuals of the more abundant sex compete with each other for the privilege to mate. Sexually selected traits often evolve to become more pronounced in competitive breeding situations until the trait begins to limit the individual’s fitness. Conflicts between an individual fitness and signalling adaptations ensure that sexually selected ornaments such as plumage coloration and <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviour</b> are [...] "honest" [...] traits. Signals must be costly to ensure that only good-quality individuals can present these exaggerated sexual ornaments and behaviours.|$|E

50|$|Mating in Homarus {{is complex}} and is {{accompanied}} by a number of <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Males build mating shelters or burrows, and larger males can attract more females, producing a polygynous mating system. A few days before moulting, a female will choose a mate, and will remain in his shelter until the moult. The male will then insert a spermatophore into the female's seminal vesicle, where it may be stored for several years. The eggs of Homarus species are laid in the autumn, being fertilised externally as they exit, and are carried by the female on her pleopods.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{species of}} {{damselfly}} have elaborate <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Many species are sexually dimorphic, the males often being more brightly coloured than the females. Like dragonflies, they reproduce using indirect insemination and delayed fertilisation. A mating pair form a shape {{known as a}} [...] "heart" [...] or [...] "wheel", the male clasping the female {{at the back of}} the head, the female curling her abdomen down to pick up sperm from secondary genitalia at the base of the male's abdomen. The pair often remain together with the male still clasping the female while she lays eggs within the tissue of plants in or near water using a robust ovipositor.|$|R
500|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} is {{sexually mature}} when aged one year, and starts its <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the following December. It has a fluttering flight display in which the male flies with shallow wingbeats and a spread tail. He calls in flight and may land at a prospective nest-site. The [...] pair excavate a new hole at least [...] above the ground and usually lower than , although sometimes much higher. The chosen site is normally a tree, alive or dead, occasionally a utility pole or nest box. Old holes are rarely re-used, although the same tree {{may be used for}} nesting for several years. The nest cavity is [...] deep with an entrance hole [...] wide. It is excavated by both sexes, the male doing most of the chiselling. As with other woodpeckers, the hole is unlined, although wood chips from the excavation may cover the base of the cavity.|$|E
500|$|A single {{breeding}} pair and their brood can occupy a territory {{of up to}} around [...] and remains there year-round, though groups of ravens may enter this area to forage. Australian ravens will defend their territory by chasing, dive-bombing and occasionally striking the backs of birds of prey, foxes or even people. They generally mate for life, though occasionally one male {{has been found to}} be mated with two females in adjacent territories. If the female dies, the male Australian raven maintains the territory and finds another mate, while if the male bird is lost, the female abandons the territory. No <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviour</b> has been observed, and species that mate for life often lack elaborate courting displays. Once they begin breeding at three years of age, they live another four to five years on average. During this time they produce two surviving young each year on average. The longest-lived Australian raven recorded is an adult (of at least 3 years of age) that was banded and recaptured alive 12 years and 5 months later.|$|E
2500|$|Basking sharks {{have been}} shown from {{satellite}} tracking to overwinter in both continental shelf (less than [...] ) and deeper waters. They {{may be found in}} either small shoals or alone. Small schools in the Bay of Fundy and the Hebrides have been seen swimming nose to tail in circles in what may be a form of <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Despite their large size and threatening appearance, basking sharks are not aggressive and are harmless to humans.|$|E
5000|$|The {{yellow-billed stork}} {{is closely related}} to 3 other species in the Mycteria genus: the American woodstork (Mycteria americana), the milky stork (Mycteria cinerea) and the painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala). It is {{classified}} as belonging to one clade with these 3 other species [...] because they all display remarkable homologies in behavior and morphology. In one analytical study of feeding and <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours</b> of the wood-stork family, MP Kahl attributed the same general ethology to all members of the Mycteria genus, with few species-specific variations. These four species are collectively referred to as the wood-storks, which {{should not be confused with}} one alternative common name (wood-stork) for the yellow-billed stork.|$|R
25|$|Water mite eyes cannot form images, so Proctor {{suggests}} that males benefit from females reorientation and clutching to detect {{when he is}} {{directly in front of}} the female and should deposit spermatophores; it may also prevent males depositing spermatophores responding to residual chemical stimuli left by a female on a now empty perch (trembling was observed at recently deserted perches but never spermatophore deposition). The fanning of water over the spermatophores towards the female probably serves to move pheromones from the male to the female - this phenomenon is known in many other non-copulating arthropods, and Proctor observed that females only cease predatory <b>behaviours</b> and initiate <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours</b> after receiving the chemical signals.|$|R

40|$|Males of many {{animal species}} are reproductively {{limited by the}} {{difficulty}} and time costs of finding mates. Males of such species should be selected {{to take advantage of}} any cues that might reveal the location of prospective mates. Cues to female location are not restricted to those produced by females, but might also include the highly apparent courtship displays of males that have already found a female. By "eavesdropping" on these courting rivals, initiating sexual displays when courting rivals are detected (i. e. social facilitation of displays); males might effectively exploit the mate-searching efforts of their rivals. We tested the possibility that male Schizocosa ocreata wolf spiders exhibit social facilitation of <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours</b> using a combination of live behavioral trials and video playback with single stimulus presentations. When exposed to visual cues from another male, male S. ocreata can discern the presence of another individual whether that individual is courting or not. However, we found no evidence of social facilitation of <b>courtship</b> or chemoexploratory <b>behaviours</b> in response to seismic or visual cues presented in isolation or combined. While complex, multimodal, male courtship signals are important in mate choice by female S. ocreata, males do not appear to use these cues to socially facilitate their own courtship. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{evolution}} and spread of insecticide resistance requires knowing the relative fitness of resistant organisms. In {{the absence of}} insecticides, resistance is predicted to be costly. The Drosophila melanogaster DDT resistance allele (DDT-R) {{is associated with a}} male mating cost. This could be because resistant males are generally smaller, but DDT-R may also alter <b>courtship</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Here we tested for body size and courtship effects of DDT-R on mating success in competitive and non-competitive mating trials respectively. We also assessed relative aggression in resistant and susceptible males because aggression can also influence mating success. While the effect of DDT-R on male size partly contributed to reduced mating success, resistant males also had lower rates of courtship and were less aggressive than susceptible males. These differences contribute to the observed DDT-R mating costs. Additionally, these pleiotropic effects of DDT-R are consistent with the history and spread of resistance alleles in nature...|$|R
