40|$|This Paper {{deals with}} a design of tribometer for pin-on-disc and disc-on-disc tests. The purpose of these tests is Investigation of {{friction}} coefficient during hot forming. The main emphases of this paper are tool heating and quick tool change. The conductive sample heating is analyzed with FEM software Ansys {{and the results of}} this snalysis are taken into design consideration. Existing pin mounting design is considered as satisfying. Various disc mounting concepts are compared. The best solution - specimen mounting by an inside <b>clamping</b> <b>cone</b> with integrated specimen ejector was manufactured (heating excluding) and successfully tested...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} a special bending tool which {{is used in the}} {{formation}} of $ 90 ^o$ bends for the tube-in-tube helium flow passages of a remote delivery tube is described. The concentric thin walled stainless-steel tube assembly is filled with water and cryofrozen before they are clamped into the bending tool. The tubes are bent by pressing the tube using the bending lever over the guiding wheel. The split bush and split <b>cone</b> <b>clamping</b> arrangement ensures that there is no movement of the tubes during the bending operation. This procedure has yielded kink-free bends with good circularity...|$|R
40|$|Constrained elastic {{recovery}} of shear strain was measured after partial stress relaxation for a concentrated solution of polystyrene in chlorinated biphenyl. A constant torsional shear strain s {{was applied to}} the sample held in a cone-plate sample holder during the period of-tl<t< 0. Then the shear stress was removed by releasing the <b>clamp</b> tightening the <b>cone</b> so that the sample was al-lowed to undergo a torsional shear deformation by itself. The {{elastic recovery}} yR(t, t 1, s) was evaluated from the rotation angle of the cone measured as a function of time t. It increased and approached the ultimate value yR (00, ti, s) more rapidly when the period of relaxation ti was shorter. A large fraction of the original strain s was recovered only when the initial strain s as well as ti was very small. The effects of varying ti and s on yR (co, tl, s) /s were similar to those on the strain-dependent relaxation modulus G(ti, s) (=stress at t= 0 divided by s). When t 1 was longer than a certain time r', the ratio rR=[yR(m, t 1, s) /s]/lim[yR (co, tl, s) /s] was independent of ti and was approximately equal to th...|$|R
40|$|Rod and cone photoreceptors form gap {{junctions}} (GJs) {{which provide}} an alternative route for rod signals when light saturates the primary high gain pathway. Indirect {{evidence suggests that}} in mammals, as in lower vertebrates, rod-cone coupling is dynamically regulated by light and circadian rhythmicity through endogenous neuromodulators such as dopamine (DA). However, the only direct tests done so far, in macaque, found coupling to be static. Moreover, recordings from the postsynaptic cone bipolar cell, in mouse, suggest that this route may give only a minor contribution to rod signaling. In my thesis I investigated the functional impact and regulatory latitude of rod-cone coupling by recording, with perforated patch <b>clamp,</b> from mouse <b>cones</b> in an in vitro retinal slice preparation. In the process, I optimized the techniques required to gain intracellular access to these small and challenging neurons. I dissected rod input in the photovoltage of wild type mouse cones by exploiting differences in light sensitivity, kinetics of recovery from bright flashes, and relative spectral preference to green (G) over ultraviolet (UV) light. Most cones expressed rod-like features, including: (1) responses to dim flashes, (2) slow plateaus in response to moderately bright flashes and a transient suppression of dim flash responses, (3) long recovery of dim flash responses and slow plateaus after rod-saturating backgrounds, (4) preference for dim G over dim UV flashes, irrespective of the intrinsic spectral preference of the cone determined with rod-saturating pre-flashes. Dim and bright flash responses had different reversal potentials, consistent with an origin in separate electrotonic compartments. The role of GJs was confirmed pharmacologically. Cones dramatically increased their coupling to rods within minutes after seal formation, revealing mechanisms for rapid plastic change, triggered in my experiments by a perturbation of the intracellular milieu. In fully coupled cones the overall junctional conductance could exceed the light-sensitive conductance. In contrast to wild type animals, in connexin isoform 36 (Cx 36) knockout mice cones {{did not appear to}} be able to couple to rods, supporting a key role for Cx 36 in rod-cone GJs. In disagreement with indirect data, but similarly to what observed in single macaque cones, I found evidence that would rule out a role of the dopaminergic system in the regulation of rod-cone coupling. My work provides the first direct and conclusive evidence for rod-cone coupling in the mouse retina, an emerging model for studies of early visual processing in health and disease. This coupling is not hardwired but can be rapidly up-regulated, revealing that junctional contacts are adequate for it to play an important role in rod visual signaling and, potentially, also in the biochemical interaction between photoreceptors. The cellular mechanisms leading to a spontaneous coupling increase during patch recordings need to be investigated to reconcile the lack of DAergic modulation in single cell recordings with other indirect evidence...|$|R
