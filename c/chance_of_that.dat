25|$|Cognitive load {{also plays}} a role in ironic control theory. Studies have shown that a greater {{cognitive}} load results in an increased possibility of dream rebound occurring. In other words, when one tries to retain a heavy load of information before going to sleep, there is a high <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> information manifesting itself within the dream. There is a greater degree of dream rebound in those with a higher cognitive load opposed to those whose load was absent. With the enhancement of a high cognitive load, ironic control theory states thought suppression is more likely to occur and lead to dream rebound.|$|E
500|$|Sawa {{described}} {{his role as}} [...] "in the beginning, [...] was kinda loopy and cotter, and you know, probably not the most popular guy in school. I think {{he might have been}} a dork, you know, doing their stuff and they had their own thing going and they're after the two beautiful girls in school, but there's no <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> happening. I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes". [...] "Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible," [...] Wong said. [...] "He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. [...] He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero". Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as [...] "a very distinctive actor. He's very loose and he's kind of a cut-up when he's not on camera, but the moment the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment".|$|E
500|$|On May 25, {{during a}} game against the Florida Marlins, Posey was injured during a {{collision}} with Scott Cousins at home plate as Cousins scored the eventual-winning run on a sac fly in the 12th inning of a 7–6 Giants' loss. In the aftermath, Posey suffered a fractured fibula and torn ligaments in his ankle, requiring season-ending surgery. Cousins, who was not disciplined, said he collided with Posey intentionally in order to score. [...] "If you hit them, you punish them and you punish yourself, but you have a <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> ball coming out." [...] He expressed regret over injuring Posey, saying [...] "I certainly didn’t want him to get hurt." [...] Cousins received threats from fans, but Posey denounced them: [...] "I appreciate the continued support of Giants fans and others as I begin the process of working my way back ... But in no way do I condone threats of any kind against Scott Cousins or his family. As I said last week, I'm not out to vilify Scott." [...] In 45 games, Posey batted [...]284 with 17 runs scored, 46 hits, five doubles, four home runs, and 21 RBI.|$|E

If you want to achieve the objective that you have declared, then you should try to adopt tactics that would avoid or minimise the division of anti-BJP votes to the extent possible. This strategy should be adopted in all states other than in those states where the BJP is still not a major factor at all, where we would continue to have our main conflict with the Congress." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reid apologized on January 9, 2010, for racially tinged {{comments}} he {{had made}} when Obama was campaigning for president. In private conversations, Reid had remarked that Obama could win the Presidency because the country was ready to embrace a black presidential candidate, especially one such as Obama—to whom he referred as being [...] "light-skinned" [...] and [...] "with no Negro dialect, unless {{he wanted to have}} one". These comments had been recently revealed by journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann in Game Change, their book about the 2008 election. In addition to his public apology, Reid called Obama to apologize; Obama accepted his apology, stating that {{as far as he was}} concerned, the book was closed on the incident. RNC Chairman Michael Steele and Senators John Cornyn and Jon Kyl called on Reid to resign his leadership position in the Senate, citing Majority Leader Trent Lott resigning because of a statement relating to race. However, multiple experts said there was virtually no <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> DNC Chairman Tim Kaine and Senators Dianne Feinstein and Jack Reed expressed support for Reid and confidence he would retain his leadership position, and another senior Democrat indicated Reid has [...] "produced supportive statements from key African American leaders in the Congress and civil rights community".|$|E
