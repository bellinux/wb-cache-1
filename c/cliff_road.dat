The largest growth in Eagan took place following the relocation {{and expansion of}} Highway 77 along {{with the construction of}} the new six-lane bridge (with three northbound and three southbound lanes) over the Minnesota River in 1980 and the completion of the final Interstate 35E freeway section southbound from Minnesota State Highway 110 in Mendota Heights to the area where it joins 35W in Burnsville in the mid-1980s.

Now and then, too, there was a castle in the air of a home for little Maura at Alexis's future curacy. Kalliope seemed to look to working for life for poor mother, while Theodore should cultivate his art. Oftener the two recalled old adventures and scenes of their regimental days, and discussed the weddings of the two Indian sisters.|$|E
