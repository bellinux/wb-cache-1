2500|$|A {{number of}} flaws have been {{identified}} for the statistic, most notable among these {{the fact that a}} bowler who has taken no wickets <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bowling average, as dividing by zero does not give a result. The effect of this is that the bowling average can not distinguish between a bowler who has taken no wickets and conceded one run, and a bowler who has taken no wickets and conceded one hundred runs. The bowling average also does not tend to give a true reflection of the bowler's ability when the number of wickets they have taken is small, especially in comparison to the number of runs they have conceded. In his paper proposing an alternative method of judging batsmen and bowlers, Paul van Staden gives an example of this: ...|$|E

60|$|Let us now examine all {{the other}} {{instances}} which we can obtain, resembling this instance in the given consequent, namely, the evolution of an opposite electricity {{in the neighborhood of}} an electrified body. As one remarkable instance we have the Leyden jar; and after the splendid experiments of Faraday in complete and final establishment of the substantial identity of magnetism and electricity, we may cite the magnet, both the natural and the electro-magnet, in neither of which it is possible to produce one kind of electricity by itself, or to charge one pole without charging an opposite pole with the contrary electricity at the same time. We <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> magnet with one pole: if we break a natural loadstone into a thousand pieces, each piece will have its two oppositely electrified poles complete within itself. In the voltaic circuit, again, we can not have one current without its opposite. In the ordinary electric machine, the glass cylinder or plate, and the rubber, acquire opposite electricities.|$|E
6000|$|Let us now, for {{the more}} full {{understanding}} of the subject, {{go to the other}} extreme, and consider a case in which the management is as far as possible removed from that above referred to. We <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better example than the method often adopted in schools and seminaries for teaching composition; in other words, the art of expressing one's thoughts in written language--an art which one would suppose to be so analogous to that of learning to talk--that is, to express one's thoughts in oral language--that the method which was found so eminently successful in the one would be naturally resorted to in the other. Instead of that, the method often pursued is exactly the reverse. The pupil having with infinite difficulty, and with many forebodings and anxious fears, made his first attempt, brings it to his teacher. The teacher, if he is a kind-hearted and considerate man, perhaps briefly commends the effort with some such dubious and equivocal praise as it is [...] "Very well for a beginner," [...] or [...] "As good a composition as could be expected at the first attempt," [...] and then proceeds to go over the exercise in a cool and deliberate manner, with a view of discovering and bringing out clearly and conspicuously to the view, not only of the little author himself, but often of all his classmates and friends, every imperfection, failure, mistake, omission, or other fault which a rigid scrutiny can detect in the performance. However kindly he may do this, and however gentle the tones of his voice, still the work is criticism and fault-finding from beginning to end. The boy sits on thorns and nettles while submitting to the operation, and when he takes his marked and corrected manuscript to his seat, he feels mortified and ashamed, and is often hopelessly discouraged.|$|E

5000|$|In {{classical}} physics, {{an effect}} can't occur before its cause. In the relativity theory, causality means that an effect <b>can</b> <b>not</b> occur from a cause {{which is not}} in the back (past) light cone of that event. Similarly, <b>a</b> cause <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> effect outside its front (future) light cone. These restrictions are consistent with the grounded belief (or assumption) that causal influences cannot travel faster than the speed of light and/or backwards in time. In quantum field theory, observables of events with a spacelike relationship, [...] "elsewhere", have to commute, so the order of observations or measurements of such observables do not impact each other.|$|R

Moreover, it is shown how these and related classes of life distributions can be characterized by expected remaining lifetimes after a family of random times, thus extending the notion of NBUE. We also give sufficient conditions for distributions in the M-class, by which many examples can be found. Finally, we derive reliability bounds for distributions in this class...|$|R

To find this, simply line up the cleavage lines/long direction {{with one of the}} crosshairs in the microscope, and turn the mineral until the extinction occurs. The number of degrees the stage was rotated is the {{extinction angle}}, between 0-89 degrees. 90 degrees would be considered zero degrees, and is known as parallel extinction. Inclined extinction is a measured angle between 1-89 degrees.

40|$|Though {{realistic}} eulerian fluid simulation systems now provide believable movements, straightforward renderable surface representation, {{and affordable}} computation costs, {{they are still}} unable to deal with non-static objects in a realistic manner. Namely, objects <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> influence on the fluid and be simultaneously affected by the fluid's motion. In this paper, a simulation scheme for fluids allowing automatic generation of physically plausible motions alongside realistic interactions with solids is proposed. The method relies mainly on {{the definition of a}} coupling force between the solids and the fluid, thus bridging the gap between commonly used eulerian fluid animation models and lagrangian solid ones. This new method thus improves existing fluid simulations, making them capable of generating new kinds of motions, such as a floating ball displaced by the wave created thanks to its own splash into the water...|$|R

The graphical solution given at the end of section five of the paper, however, shows that our problem <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> optimal minimum value since the minimum output is not unique.
