40|$|AbstractWe {{begin by}} determining, {{in a general}} form, <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> {{irreducible}} representations of a Jones basic construction and use this result to compute <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temperley-Lieb algebras and the Okada algebras. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Birman-Wenzl algebra some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> {{are determined by the}} general theorem and the others are computed by using the duality between the Birman-Wenzl algebras and the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups of types B and C. The computations involve certain <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quantum group; these are polynomials invariant under <b>the</b> Weyl group <b>of</b> type B. We are able to decompose these Weyl group symmetric functions and obtain a combinatorial rule for computing <b>the</b> irreducible <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Birman-Wenzl algebras. The combinatorial rules for computing <b>the</b> irreducible <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iwahori-Hecke algebras and the combinatorial rule for computing <b>the</b> irreducible <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brauer algebras are both special cases of our rule for the Birman-Wenzl algebras...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn [A.  Turull, J.  Algebra 235 (2001), 275 – 314], we {{calculated}} <b>the</b> Schur index <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> irreducible <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite special linear groups. In the present paper, we calculate <b>the</b> Schur index <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> irreducible <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> some overgroups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> special linear groups. The overgroups in question are the special linear groups extended by diagonal automorphisms, and <b>the</b> subgroups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general linear group that contain the special linear group. To each conjugacy class <b>of</b> irreducible <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> special linear group in each overgroup is associated a Clifford class. The Clifford class controls all <b>the</b> irreducible <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overgroup and intermediate subgroups {{that are related}} to the given irreducible by Clifford theory. Knowing only the Clifford class, we can parametrize all <b>the</b> irreducible <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intermediate subgroups, and compute, for each parametrized irreducible <b>character,</b> its field <b>of</b> <b>character</b> values, as well as its Schur index over each field. We explicitly compute the Clifford class in each case, and deduce from it the information on <b>the</b> Schur index <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> irreducible <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overgroups...|$|R
