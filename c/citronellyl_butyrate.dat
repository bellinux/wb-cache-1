40|$|Lipase from C. cylindracea was covalently immobilised to {{a number}} of surface-treated ceramic {{supports}} (3 - 10 mg. (g dry w t support) -'). At room temperature, the immobilised lipase could convert R,S-citronellol and butyric acid to <b>citronellyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> at rates in the range 7 - 51 p o l. (mg lipase. min) -I.

40|$|Abstract. Free and immobilized Candida rugosa lipases were {{investigated}} for {{the synthesis of}} <b>citronellyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> by direct esterification reaction in n-hexane as organic solvent. A set of experiments was carried out to verify the influence of various parameters on the formation of <b>citronellyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> by free Candida rugosa lipase, such as lipase loading, substrate molar ratio, temperature, three kinds of support for immobilization, and ratio of immobilization. The conversion was increased with increasing lipase loading. The behavior of leveling-off in esterification was observed at higher lipase loading which gave the optimal amount of lipase loading at 3. 33 g/l with 92 % conversion. This {{might be due to}} the excess of lipase active sites, which remained inside the bulk of lipase particles, was not contributing significantly to the reaction. Increasing butyric acid and citronellol concentrations (at fixed citronellol and butyric acid concentrations, respectively) inhibited the lipase activity due to competitive nature of alcohol and acid binding. Optimal acid conversion was obtained at 40 °C after 24 -h incubation time. Above this temperature, however, the activity of lipase-catalyzed esterification begins to decrease due to denaturation of protein. From the three kinds of supports for immobilized lipase, Amberlite MB- 1 showed the highest conversion compared to Amberlite XAD- 1180 and Celite 545. The optimal acid conversion was obtained at lipase loading of 10 mg lipase/g support. At this loading, lipase attempts to optimize its contact with the surface of the support whereby optimum active conformation was retained...|$|E
40|$|Short chain citronellyl esters were {{synthesized}} {{by a new}} microbial lipase from Rhizopus sp strain {{isolated and}} lipase produced at UNICAMP, Brazil. Direct esterification and transesterification reactions have been performed to produce citronellyl acetate and butyrate in a free-solvent system and with n-hexane in reaction medium. Reaction mixture for direct esterification and transesterification was carried out at 45 ºC in equimolar concentration of substrates: acid or ester and alcohol. Only <b>citronellyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> was synthesized by direct esterification with yields from 95 to 100 % after 24 hrs. of reaction time, with or without n-hexane. Citronellyl acetate was synthesized by transesterification with ethyl acetate and cytronellol, with yield of 58 % after 48 hrs. and 48 % of conversion for reaction butyl acetate an...|$|E
40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} need for nonlethal and {{environmentally}} safe vertebrate repellents {{for a variety of}} uses. One promising source of candidate repellents is plant secondary compounds, many of which have evolved to defend against invertebrate herbivory. In this study I tested six citronellyl compounds that are used in the human flavor and fragrance industry. Testing was conducted with an invasive and exotic avian pest species in North America, the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). All six compounds tested were highly repellent to the birds and repellency was similar across treatment days. A dose–response experiment revealed that two of the six compounds, citronellyl acetate and <b>citronellyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> tended to be repellent at lower concentrations (chow treated with 0. 1 : 1 mixture of the citronellyl in ethanol) than the others (1 : 1 mixture). One compound, citronellyl valerate was also tested for within-day secondary repellency but no evidence was seen for this. It can be concluded that some plant derivatives are suitable for use as avia...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out to isolate, identify, and to characterize, major {{volatile}} components of tomato fruit. Simultaneously, the confirmation was extended to the reported tomato volatiles. The volatile extracts from field- and artificially - ripe fruits were compared qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The changes which occurred in the volatile components of the fruit {{at the onset of}} senescence also were delineated. A typical chromatogram from field-ripe tomatoes contained 60 peaks. The functional group properties of individual peaks were derived by chemical analysis. The short-chain (C 3 -C 6) alcohols represented 10 per cent, aldehydes and ketones 32 per cent, and hydrocarbons, long-chain alcohols, and esters were in 58 per cent of the total amount of the volatiles from the field-ripe fruits. Among alcohols and carbonyls, 3 -pantanol, 1 -nonanal, 1 -decanal, and 1 -dodecanal and among esters, propyl acetate, geranyl acetate, and cetronellyl butyrate were tentatively identified as volatile compounds of tomato fruit. Linalyl acetate, <b>citronellyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> and geranyl butyrate were identified {{for the first time as}} the components of tomato volatiles. Comparisons of volatile concentrations of field- and artificially - ripe tomatoes were made. IN the latter category of fruits the concentrations of 1 -butanol, 3 -pentanol, 2 -methyl- 3 -hexanol, 3 -methyl-butanal, 2, 3 -butanedione, propyl acetate, isopentyl butyrate, and other unidentified carbonyls were higher than those observed in the field-ripe fruits. These short-chain compounds, especially the C 4 -C 6 moities, probably are formed in their maximum concentrations during the early stages of maturation. Under the conditions of restricted nutrient availability, sun light, and limited enzymatic activity during artificial ripening, the long-chain compounds are not sunthesized appreciably. The concentrations of some of these short-chain compounds may be to a level of masking the effects of more desirable compounds contributory to ripe tomato aroma. Notably, a pulp from the artificially ripe fruits lacked the characteristic ripe tomato aroma. The concentrations of the long-chain carbonyls and the terpene esters were low in the artificially ripe tomatoes as compared to the field-ripe ones. This may indicate major contribution of these compounds to ripe tomato aroma. An attempt has been made to theorize the mechanisms of the biogenesis of these components of tomato volatiles. The concentrations of the volatiles from field-ripe and overripe tomatoes were compared. During overripening the amounts of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acetates, and propionates generally decreased. However, the concentrations of diacetyl and butyric acid esters increased. It was assumed that at the onset of senescence the metabolic pathways for the formation of diacetyl and butyric acid were highly operative in tomato fruit. The mechanisms of these pathways were postulated...|$|E
