40|$|Ataxia {{telangiectasia}} mutated (ATM) deficiency predisposes {{humans and}} mice to T lineage lymphomas with recurrent chromosome 14 translocations involving the T cell receptor α/δ (Tcra/d) locus. Such translocations have been thought {{to result from}} aberrant repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during Tcra locus V(D) J recombination, and to require the Tcra enhancer (Eα) for Tcra rearrangement or expression of the translocated oncogene. We now show that, {{in addition to the}} known chromosome 14 translocation, ATM-deficient mouse thymic lymphomas routinely contain a <b>centromeric</b> <b>fragment</b> of chromosome 14 that spans up to the 5 ′ boundary of the Tcra/d locus, at which position a 500 -kb or larger region centromeric to Tcra/d is routinely amplified. In addition, they routinely contain a large deletion of the telomeric end of one copy of chromosome 12. In contrast to prior expectations, the recurrent translocations and amplifications involve V(D) J recombination–initiated breaks in the Tcrd locus, as opposed to the Tcra locus, and arise independently of the Eα. Overall, our studies reveal previously unexpected mechanisms that contribute to the oncogenic transformation of ATM-deficient T lineage cells...|$|E
40|$|The DNA-dependent {{protein kinase}} (DNA-PK) {{consists}} of three polypeptide components: Ku- 70, Ku- 80, and an approximately 350 -kDa catalytic subunit (p 350). The gene encoding the Ku- 80 subunit {{is identical to the}} x-ray-sensitive group 5 complementing gene XRCC 5. Expression of the Ku- 80 cDNA rescues both DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and V(D) J recombination in group 5 mutant cells. The involvement of Ku- 80 in these processes suggests that the underlying defect in these mutant cells may be disruption of the DNA-PK holoenzyme. In this report we show that the p 350 kinase subunit is deleted in cells derived from the severe combined immunodeficiency mouse and in the Chinese hamster ovary cell line V- 3, both of which are defective in DSB repair and V(D) J recombination. A <b>centromeric</b> <b>fragment</b> of human chromosome 8 that complements the scid defect also restores p 350 protein expression and rescues in vitro DNA-PK activity. These data suggest the scid gene may encode the p 350 protein or regulate its expression and are consistent with a model whereby DNA-PK is a critical component of the DSB-repair pathway...|$|E
40|$|Specimens of the endemic New Zealand frog Leiopelma hochstetteri from Tapu on North Island {{were found}} to have six, nine or ten {{supernumerary}} chromosomes in their karyotypes. In comparison with previously published data, these results further indicate probable geographic variation in supernumerary chromosome number between populations. Increased numbers of supernumeraries in these frogs is correlated with apparent decrease of centromeric heterochromatin in the five large metacentric chromosomes of the karyotype, as detected by C-banding. Meiosis was abnormal in a male with a high number of supernumeraries. In lampbrush preparations from a single female with one supernumerary univalent, the supernumerary often had a denser, beaded appearance in comparison with the regular bivalents. Evidence is consistent with the notion that these supernumerary chromosomes may have arisen from <b>centromeric</b> <b>fragments...</b>|$|R

40|$|We resequenced and phased 27 kb of DNA within 580 kb of the MHC class II {{region in}} 158 {{population}} chromosomes, {{most of which}} were conserved extended haplotypes (CEHs) of European descent or contained their <b>centromeric</b> <b>fragments.</b> We determined the single nucleotide polymorphism and deletion-insertion polymorphism alleles of the dominant sequences from HLA-DQA 2 to DAXX for these CEHs. Nine of 13 CEHs remained sufficiently intact to possess a dominant sequence extending at least to DAXX, 230 kb centromeric to HLA-DPB 1. We identified the regions centromeric to HLA-DQB 1 within which single instances of eight "common" European MHC haplotypes previously sequenced by the MHC Haplotype Project (MHP) were representative of those dominant CEH sequences. Only two MHP haplotypes had a dominant CEH sequence throughout the centromeric and extended class II region and one MHP haplotype did not represent a known European CEH anywhere in the region. We identified the centromeric recombination transition points of other MHP sequences from CEH representation to non-representation. Several CEH pairs or groups shared sequence identity in small blocks but had significantly different (although still conserved for each separate CEH) sequences in surrounding regions. These patterns partly explain strong calculated linkage disequilibrium over only short (tens to hundreds of kilobases) distances {{in the context of a}} finite number of observed megabase-length CEHs comprising half a population's haplotypes. Our results provide a clearer picture of European CEH class II allelic structure and population haplotype architecture, improved regional CEH markers, and raise questions concerning regional recombination hotspots...|$|R
40|$|A 13, 863 -base-pair (bp) {{putative}} <b>centromeric</b> DNA <b>fragment</b> {{has been}} isolated {{from a human}} genomic library by using a probe obtained from metaphase chromosomes of human colon carcinoma cells. The abundance of this DNA {{was estimated to be}} 16 - 32 copies per genome. Cotransfection of mouse cells with this sequence and a selectable marker gene (aminoglycoside 3 '-phosphotransferase type II, APH-II) resulted in a transformed cell line carrying an additional centromere in a dicentric chromosome. This centromere was capable of binding an anti-centromere antibody. In situ hybridization demonstrated that the human DNA sequence as well as the APH-II gene and vector DNA sequences were located only in the additional centromere of the dicentric chromosome. The extra centromere separated from the dicentric chromosome, forming a stable minichromosome. This functional centromere linked to a dominant selectable marker may be a step toward the construction of an artificial mammalian chromosome...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Artificial {{chromosomes}} (ACs) are {{a promising}} next-generation vector for genetic engineering. The most common methods for developing AC constructs are to clone and combine centromeric DNA and telomeric DNA fragments {{into a single}} large DNA construct. The AC constructs developed from such methods will contain very short telomeric DNA fragments because telomeric repeats can not be stably maintained in Escherichia coli.

40|$|This study aimed to: (i) {{determine}} whether oocytes {{are present in}} cultures of human fetal ovary; (ii) identify whether meiotic anomalies are evident; and (iii) assess whether preparation or culture conditions influence oocyte survival and meiotic progression. Ovaries were collected from fetuses after termination at 13 - 16 weeks, Oocyte assessment utilized antibodies specific for synaptonemal complex proteins (associated with chromosomes only during meiosis), and antibodies to <b>centromeric</b> proteins. <b>Fragments</b> of tissue were cultured in minimal essential medium + 10 % serum +/- follicle stimulating hormone (100 mIU/ml). The sera were fetal calf serum (FCS), FCS for embryonic stem cells (ES-FCS) and human female serum. The numbers and stages of oocytes were assessed after 7 - 40 days, and particular arrangements of chromosome synapsis identified. Results in fresh tissue included oocytes at leptotene, zygotene, pachytene and diplotene in three of five samples. Four specimens remained viable in vitro, and three had detectable oocytes after culture. The numbers of oocytes and the proportions of zygotene and pachytene cells increased with time in culture, The proportion of degenerate cells in culture was initially higher than in fresh samples, but declined subsequently. More oocytes were detected in ES-FCS and human serum than in FCS, We conclude that human oocytes survive in culture and that progression through prophase I continues...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Unrepaired DNA {{double-stranded}} breaks (DSBs) {{can result}} in the whole or partial loss of chromosomes. Previously, we showed that the ends of broken chromosomes remain associated. Here, we have examined the machinery that holds broken chromosome ends together, and we have explored the behavior of broken chromosomes as they pass through mitosis. Results: Using GFP-localized arrays flanking an HO endonuclease site, we examined the association of broken chromosome ends in yeast cells that are checkpoint-arrested in metaphase. This association is partially dependent upon Rad 50 and Rad 52. After 6 – 8 hr, cells adapted to the checkpoint and resumed mitosis, segregating the broken chromosome. When this occurred, {{we found that the}} acentric fragments cosegregated into either the mother or daughter cell 95 % of the time. Similarly, pedigree analysis showed that postmitotic repair of a broken chromosome (rejoining the centric and acentric fragments) occurred in either the mother or daughter cell, but rarely both, consistent with a model in which both acentric sister chromatid fragments are passaged into the same nucleus. Conclusions: These data suggest two related phenomena: an intrachromosomal association that holds the halves of a single broken sister chromatid together in metaphase and an interchromosomal force that tethers broken sister chromatids to each other and promotes their missegregation. Strikingly, the interchromosomal association of DNA breaks also promotes the missegregation of <b>centromeric</b> chromosomal <b>fragments,</b> albeit to a lesser extent than acentric fragments. The DNA break-induced missegregation of acentric and centric chromosome fragments provides a novel mechanism for the loss of heterozygosity that precedes tumorigenesis in mammalian cells...|$|R

The lethal dose of the aqueous extract was considered to be 10. 33 g/kg of the body weight, injected subcutaneously. The doses which were chosen for treatments were 2, 1, and 0. 25 g/kg. H. triquetrifolium extract induce statistically significant increases in the average numbers of micronucleus(MN) at the dose 2 g/kg and chromosome aberrations at the doses 2 and 1 g/kg,the majority of aberrations observed were chromatid breaks, <b>centromeric</b> breaks, acentric <b>fragments.</b> The extract was found to inhibit mitotic index (MI) in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover the plant extract showed a significant induction of sperm abnormalities in all concentrations used comparing with the untreated animals. The most frequent types of sperm abnormalities of the treated groups were; amorphous, pseudo-droplet defect, bent mid piece defect and corkscrew mid piece defect. However, the lowest dose 0. 25 g/kg body weight was the most effective one which markedly increased the corkscrew midpiece defect.

40|$|Irrespective of micro organisms or metazoans, {{cellular}} components sometimes unevenly inherited to the progenies during cell division. Currently, this phenomenon, {{which is}} known as an asymmetric cell division, is shown to be intimately connected with development and cellular homeostasis maintenance. In the asymmetric cell division subcellular constituents including transcripts, proteins, and organelle such as endoplasmic reticulum and centriole segregate unevenly. Moreover, chromosomal DNAs are also inherited unevenly, though the phenomenon remains to be confirmed. In this study, I constructed an assay system that enables us to detect the non-random sister chromatids segregation. Using the system I analyzed if the event is {{taken place in the}} budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As a result, I succeeded in obtaining evidence that two sisters are selected and non-randomly segregated. 　　　As a model system to analyze the non-random chromosome segregation, I employed the rDNA repeats that reside on the chromosome XII in S. cerevisiae. In the region, the copy number of rDNA repeats frequently varies and it was expected that distinct sister chromatids arise during DNA replication. For this reason, I assumed the non-random sister chromatid segregation can be observed in the rDNA. I continuously separated the progenies of cell division (the daughter and mother cells) by centrifugal elutriation to trace the fate of sister chromatids that are bearing the rDNA repeats. Consequently, when compared the rDNA copy number in the sorted cells, the daughter and mother cell lineages clearly differed. The daughter lineage constituently inherited a sister chromatid that harbors increased copy number of rDNA, while in the mother lineage the number did not change. Therefore, it seemed like that the Chr. XII was differentiated during cell division and non-randomly segregated to the progenies. Remarkably, the pattern of sister chromatids inheritance showed the lineage specificity. This indicated that S. cerevisiae was recognizing the two sister chromatids. 　　　To explore the cis acting mechanisms underlying the non-random sister chromatid segregation, I analyzed the effect of centromere. In S. cerevisiae, centromeric sequences that associate with the kinetochore proteins have directionality. And also, some of the mitotic apparatuses involved in chromosome segregation are polarized during cell division. I speculated that there are some relationship between the polarity of centromere and mitotic apparatus, and the non-random sister chromatid segregation. To analyze the relationship, I exchanged the CEN 12 (Chr. XII centromere) sequences with other <b>centromeric</b> <b>fragments</b> that harbors opposite directionality and analyzed the phenotypes in the strain. Although the pattern of sister chromatid segregation was anaryzed in the CEN 12 -modified strains, the directionality of centromere seemed not to be important. 　　　As the other case, I also analyzed the effect of the directionality of rDNA repeat. On the tandemly aligned rDNA repeats, several biological processes, including transcription and replication, are performed in unidirectional way. I investigated whether this directionality is involved in the asymmetric chromosome segregation. For this purpose, the rDNA repeat was reconstructed in inverted direction using a strain that lost the rDNA repeat completely. Unexpectedly, the newly introduced rDNA repeats had lost the competency for increasing their copy number on Chr. XII. Therefore, the effect of the rDNA directionality could not be estimated. 　　　Apart from the cis elements, then I wondered if trans factors associate with the regulation of the sister chromatid segregation. In the mutants that affect stability(sir 2 △),nuclear localization (heh 1 △), and segregation (bud 6 △) of the IDNA, the fate of sister chromatid segtegation was analyzed. In the sir 2 △ and heh 1 △ the segregation pattern of Chr. XII was equivalent to that of WT. In the bud 6 △,it　was　not　able　to　detect　the rDNA copy number change by our analysis. From these result, I speculated that nuclear positioning and chromatin stnrctures of the rDNA {{had little to do with}} the pattern of sister chromatid segregation. 　　　Finally, I concerned about the possibility that the non-random chromosome segregation specifrcally occurred in the Chr. XII. To investigate this possibility. I performed BrdU pulse-chase analysis to trace the segregation pattern of whole chromosomes. In this analysis, I could not observe the apparently biased DNA strand retention in 16 chromosomes including the Chr. XII at least when recombination in the rDNA was repressed. 　　　In conclusion, I obtained the first evidence of the non-random chromosome segregation in S. cerevisiae. Thus S. cerevisiae seems to maintains a system which distinguish the two sister chromatids during cytokinesis. Further study will reveal how such a chromosome segregation was taken plac...|$|R
