40|$|Introduction. Residues of {{previous}} crops provide a valuable amount {{of organic matter}} {{that can be used}} either to restore soil fertility or for external use. A better understanding of the impact of <b>crop</b> residue <b>management</b> on the soil-water-plant system is needed in order to manage agricultural land sustainably. This review focuses on soil physical aspects related to <b>crop</b> residue <b>management,</b> and specifically on the link between soil structure and hydraulic properties and its impact on crop production. Literature. Conservation practices, including crop residue retention and non-conventional tillage, can enhance soil health by improving aggregate stability. In this case, water infiltration is facilitated, resulting in an increase in plant water availability. Conservation practices, however, do not systematically lead to higher water availability for the plant. The influence of <b>crop</b> residue <b>management</b> on <b>crop</b> production is still unclear; in some cases, crop production is enhanced by residue retention, but in others crop residues can reduce crop yield. Conclusions. In this review we discuss the diverse and contrasting effects of <b>crop</b> residue <b>management</b> on soil physical properties and crop production under a temperate climate. The review highlights the importance of environmental factors such as soil type and local climatic conditions, highlighting the need to perform field studies on <b>crop</b> residue <b>management</b> and relate them to specific pedo-climatic contexts...|$|R

25|$|Scientists have {{identified}} and cloned many genes {{involved in the}} gibberellin signaling pathway, including GAI1 (Gibberellin Insensitive) and SLR1 (Slender Rice). Disruption of gibberellin signaling can lead to significantly reduced stem growth leading to a dwarf phenotype. Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. In the presence of nitrogen fertilizers, and intensive <b>crop</b> <b>management,</b> these varieties increase their yield two to three times.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, global wheat output {{expanded}} by about 5-fold, but until about 1955 {{most of this}} reflected increases in wheat crop area, with lesser (about 20%) increases in crop yields per unit area. After 1955 however, there was a ten-fold increase {{in the rate of}} wheat yield improvement per year, and this became the major factor allowing global wheat production to increase. Thus technological innovation and scientific <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> with synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, irrigation and wheat breeding were the main drivers of wheat output growth {{in the second half of}} the century. There were some significant decreases in wheat crop area, for instance in North America.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{husbandry}} and Integrated <b>Crop</b> <b>Management</b> (ICM) {{often are}} just two branches of one agricultural enterprise. In modern agriculture, animal husbandry and crop production must be understood as interlinked sectors which cannot be looked at in isolation, as the context of agricultural systems leads to tight interdependencies. Uncoupling animal husbandry from arable production (too high stocking rates) is therefore not considered {{in accordance with the}} principles and objectives of Integrated Farming (Lütke Entrup et al., 1998 1). Accordingly, holistic concepts for Integrated Farming or Integrated Farm Management such as the EISA Integrated Farming Framework, and the concept of sustainable agriculture are increasingly developed, promoted and implemented at the global level.|$|E

25|$|There {{is a big}} gap {{among various}} {{countries}} {{between high and low}} yields, even with the same variety of potato. Average potato yields in developed economies ranges between 38–44 tonnes per hectare. China and India accounted for over a third of world's production in 2010, and had yields of 14.7 and 19.9 tonnes per hectare respectively. The yield gap between farms in developing economies and developed economies represents an opportunity loss of over 400 million tonnes of potato, or an amount greater than 2010 world potato production. Potato crop yields are determined by factors such as the crop breed, seed age and quality, <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> practices and the plant environment.

25|$|Wheat {{normally}} needs between 110 and 130 days between sowing and harvest, {{depending upon}} climate, seed type, and soil conditions (winter wheat lies dormant during a winter freeze). Optimal <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> {{requires that the}} farmer have a detailed understanding of each stage of development in the growing plants. In particular, spring fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, and growth regulators are typically applied only at specific stages of plant development. For example, it is currently recommended that the second application of nitrogen is best done when the ear (not visible at this stage) is about 1cm in size (Z31 on Zadoks scale). Knowledge of stages {{is also important to}} identify periods of higher risk from the climate. For example, pollen formation from the mother cell, and the stages between anthesis and maturity are susceptible to high temperatures, and this adverse effect is made worse by water stress. Farmers also benefit from knowing when the 'flag leaf' (last leaf) appears, as this leaf represents about 75% of photosynthesis reactions during the grain filling period, and so should be preserved from disease or insect attacks to ensure a good yield.|$|E

40|$|Conservation {{agriculture}} {{practices are}} being advocated to help sustain crop productivity gains and secure environmental sustainability in the Trans-Gangetic Plains, India's Green Revolution heartland. The paper illustrates {{the use of}} village surveys as a quasi-quantitative system analysis tool to derive implications for agricultural research and development. Drawing from village surveys in 170 communities, the paper assesses current <b>crop</b> residue <b>management</b> practices in Punjab and Haryana's rice-wheat, basmati-wheat and non-rice-wheat cropping systems. The prevalence of wheat as the winter crop implies an intensive collection, trading and use of wheat straw as basal feed for dairy livestock; which contrasts with the diverse <b>crop</b> residue <b>management</b> of the monsoon crops. The increased use of combine harvesters has spurred the rapid advent of mechanical wheat straw reapers whereas the bulk of combine harvested rice straw is burned in situ. Present <b>crop</b> residue <b>management</b> practices are largely incompatible with year-round mulch retention despite significant biomass production. The research and development community faces the challenge of evening out straw use and management over seasons to ensure at least partial residue retention if its calls for conservation agriculture in this important sub-region are to succeed.

The equation takes the simple product form:The USLE has another concept of experimental importance, the unit plot concept. The unit plot {{is defined as the}} standard plot condition to determine the soil's erodibility. These conditions are when the LS factor = 1 (slope = 9% and length = 72.6 feet) where the plot is fallow and tillage is up and down slope and no conservation practices are applied (CP=1). In this state:A simpler method to predict K was presented by Wischmeier et al. which includes the particle size of the soil, organic matter content, soil structure and profile permeability. The soil erodibility factor K can be approximated from a nomograph if this information is known. The LS factors can easily be determined from a slope effect chart by knowing the length and gradient of the slope. The <b>cropping</b> <b>management</b> factor (C) and conservation practices factor (P) are more difficult to obtain and must be determined empirically from plot data.
