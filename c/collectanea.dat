5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Skene found and {{transcribed}} a 15th-century Gaelic manuscript {{which gave the}} genealogies of many Highland clans. He first published his transcriptions and translations {{of it in the}} early 19th century <b>Collectanea</b> de Rebus Albanicis, and later with revisions in the late 19th centuryin his chief work Celtic Scotland. Today the manuscript, which Skene named MS 1450 and later MS 1467, is stored in the National Library of Scotland. The manuscript was written by Dubhghall Albanach mac mhic Cathail, in 1467 at Ballybothy, Co Tipperary. The following is Skene's versions of the genealogy attributed to the chiefs of Clan Macfie in the manuscript; first as in <b>Collectanea</b> de Rebus Albanicis secondly as in Celtic Scotland.|$|E
5|$|According to Skene in <b>Collectanea</b> de Rebus Albanicis, the Donald first {{mentioned}} {{may be the}} Donald MacDuffie who {{is recorded}} as witnessing a charter by John, Earl of Ross and Lord of the Isles in 1463. In Celtic Scotland, Skene thought it was possible the mentioned Duffie/Dubshithe was identical to the lector of Iona recorded in 1164 within the Irish annals.|$|E
5|$|In 1751, Francis Blomefield, in his <b>Collectanea</b> Cantabrigiensia, {{recorded}} StJames' {{as having}} a square tower, with four bells and a clock. The north aisle was leaded {{and there was a}} chantry chapel at the east end with a screen. He concludes this to be the Chancel of the Resurrection. At this time, the south aisle, nave and chancel were also recorded as leaded.|$|E
5|$|The barrow then {{received}} a mention in George Payne's <b>Collectanea</b> Cantiana, published in 1893. Payne noted a folk tradition {{that there were}} stone avenues connecting Coldrum to the Addington Long Barrow, although asserted that {{he was unable to}} discover any evidence for the existence of this feature. The earliest published photographs of the monument appeared in 1908, produced by George Clinch. In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Addington Long Barow alongside the other Medway Megaliths.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1529, Cranmer stayed with {{relatives}} in Waltham Holy Cross to avoid an outbreak of the plague in Cambridge. Two of his Cambridge associates, Stephen Gardiner and Edward Foxe, joined him. The three discussed the annulment issue and Cranmer suggested putting aside the legal case in Rome in favour of a general canvassing of opinions from university theologians throughout Europe. Henry showed much interest in the idea when Gardiner and Foxe presented him this plan. It is not known whether the king or his new Lord Chancellor, Thomas More, explicitly approved the plan. Eventually it was implemented and Cranmer was requested to join the royal team in Rome to gather opinions from the universities. Edward Foxe coordinated the research effort and the team produced the <b>Collectanea</b> Satis Copiosa ("The Sufficiently Abundant Collections") and The Determinations, historical and theological support for {{the argument that the}} king exercised supreme jurisdiction within his realm.|$|E

25|$|Leland's own {{manuscript}} notebooks were inherited by Cheke's son, Henry, and in 1576 {{they were}} borrowed and transcribed by John Stow, allowing their contents {{to begin to}} circulate in antiquarian circles. Antiquaries who gained access to them through Stow included William Camden, William Harrison, Robert Glover and Francis Thynne. The original notebooks passed from Henry Cheke to Humphrey Purefoy, and so (following his death in 1598) to Humphrey's son Thomas, who divided many of them between his two cousins John Hales and the antiquary, William Burton. Burton subsequently managed to recover several of the items given to Hales, and in 1632 and 1642-3 donated most of the collection—comprising the <b>Collectanea,</b> De scriptoribus {{and several of the}} Itinerary notebooks—to the Bodleian Library, Oxford, where the volumes remain.|$|E

Merrifield retired in 1978, and a festschrift, entitled <b>Collectanea</b> Londiniensia: Studies in London Archaeology and History Presented to Ralph Merrifield, was published in his honour. Recognising his many years of service to the archaeological field, the University of London awarded him an honorary doctorate.|$|E
500|$|In August 1889, two amateur archaeologists, George Payne and A. A. Arnold, {{came across}} the monument, which they noted was known among locals as the [...] "Coldrum Stones" [...] and [...] "Druid Temple"; {{according}} to Payne, [...] "the huge stones were so overgrown with brambles and brushwood {{that they could not}} be discerned". He returned the next year, noting that the brushwood had since been cut away to reveal the megaliths. [...] In his 1893 book <b>Collectanea</b> Cantiana, Payne noted that although it had first been described in print in 1844, [...] "since that time no one seems to have taken the trouble to properly record them or make a plan", an unusual claim given that a copy of Petrie's published plan existed in his library. For this reason, after gaining permission from the landowner, he convinced Major A. O. Green, Instructor in Survey at Brompton, to conduct a survey of the monument in August 1892. He also wrote to the archaeologist Augustus Pitt-Rivers, encouraging him to schedule the Coldrum Stones as a legally protected site under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882. Payne described the Coldrum Stones as [...] "the finest monument of its class in the county, and one worthy of every care and attention." [...] Comparing it to other monuments of its type in Britain, he stated that it was undoubtedly [...] "of sepulchral origin, belonging to a period anterior to the Roman domination of Britain." [...] Payne also noted a folk tradition that there were stone avenues connecting Coldrum to the Addington Long Barrow, although added that he was unable to discover any physical evidence of this feature.|$|E

2500|$|Encyclopædia Britannica states: [...] "according to Western church tradition, Balthasar {{is often}} {{represented}} as a king of Arabia, Melchior as a king of Persia, and Gaspar as a king of India." [...] These names apparently derive from a Greek manuscript probably composed in Alexandria around 500, and which has been translated into Latin with the title Excerpta Latina Barbari. Another Greek document from the 8th century, of presumed Irish origin and translated into Latin with the title <b>Collectanea</b> et Flores, continues the tradition of three kings and their names and gives additional details.|$|E
2500|$|Hagiography records {{other names}} {{he is said}} to have borne. Tírechán's seventh-century <b>Collectanea</b> gives: [...] "Magonus, that is, famous; Succetus, that is, god of war; Patricius, that is, father of the citizens; Cothirthiacus, because he served four houses of druids." [...] "Magonus" [...] appears in the ninth century Historia Brittonum as Maun, {{descending}} from British *Magunos, meaning [...] "servant-lad". [...] "Succetus", which also appears in Muirchú moccu Machtheni's seventh century Life as Sochet, is identified by Mac Neill as [...] "a word of British origin meaning swineherd". Cothirthiacus also appears as Cothraige in the 8th century biographical poem known as Fiacc's Hymn {{and a variety of other}} spellings elsewhere, and is taken to represent a Primitive Irish *Qatrikias, although this is disputed. Harvey argues that Cothraige [...] "has the form of a classic Old Irish tribal (and therefore place-) name", noting that Ail Coithrigi is a name for the Rock of Cashel, and the place-names Cothrugu and Catrige are attested in Counties Antrim and Carlow.|$|E
2500|$|According to the French legend, {{gingerbread}} {{was brought}} to Europe in 992 by the Armenian monk, later saint, Gregory of Nicopolis (Gregory Makar). He lived for seven years in Bondaroy, France, {{near the town of}} Pithiviers, where he taught gingerbread cooking to priests and other Christians. He died in 999. An early medieval Christian legend elaborates on the Gospel of Matthew's account of the birth of Jesus. According to the legend, attested to in a Greek document from the 8th century, of presumed Irish origin and translated into Latin with the title <b>Collectanea</b> et Flores, in addition to gold, frankincense, and myrrh, given as gifts by three [...] "wise men from the east" [...] (magi), [...] ginger was the gift of one wise man (magus) who was unable to complete the journey to Bethlehem. As he was lingering in his last days in a city in Syria, the magus gave his chest of ginger roots to the Rabbi who had kindly cared for him in his illness. The Rabbi told him of the prophesies of the great King who was to come to the Jews, one of which was that He would be born in Bethlehem, which, in Hebrew, meant [...] "House of Bread". The Rabbi was accustomed to having his young students make houses of bread to eat over time to nourish the hope for their Messiah. The Magus suggested adding ground-up ginger to the bread for zest and flavor. Gingerbread, as we know it today, descends from Medieval European culinary traditions. Gingerbread was also shaped into different forms by monks in Franconia, Germany in the 13th century. Lebkuchen bakers are recorded as early as 1296 in Ulm and 1395 in Nuremberg, Germany. Nuremberg was recognized as the [...] "Gingerbread Capital of the World" [...] when in the 1600s the guild started to employ master bakers and skilled workers to create complicated works of art from gingerbread. Medieval bakers used carved boards to create elaborate designs. During the 13th century, the custom spread across Europe. It was taken to Sweden in the 13th century by German immigrants; there are references from Vadstena Abbey of Swedish nuns baking gingerbread to ease indigestion in 1444. The traditional sweetener is honey, used by the guild in Nuremberg. Spices used are ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and cardamom.|$|E
