In comparison to bare RC frames, partially infilled frames have more lateral load capacity.

40|$|The {{public and}} {{construction}} industry professionals {{are becoming increasingly}} aware of the environmental damage buildings can cause. As a result the use of more sustainable and environmentally friendly building materials and techniques is increasing. Straw bale construction is one such technique. ModCell panels are an innovative way of using straw bales in a prefabricated wall system. As ModCell panels are prefabricated the normal risks associated with straw bale construction (fire, straw getting wet during construction, unfamiliar material) are removed from the building site. The panels consist of a timber frame, braced with steel rods, in-filled with straw bales and the surfaces are then rendered with a lime render. To date ModCell panels {{have been used for}} cladding on framed buildings. However, they are now being developed for low rise domestic load-bearing applications and in order to achieve this sufficient racking shear resistance is required. Previous testing has shown that the corner joints in the panel’s timber frame are a weak point. This first aim of this thesis is to improve the racking shear resistance of ModCell panels through a series of experimental laboratory based tests {{so that they can be}} used for load-bearing applications. This thesis also aims to develop a computer model of load-bearing ModCell panels in order to further understand their structural behaviour and assist with future design and development. Different designs of frame corner joints were tested in order to find the most suitable type of joint. Screw connected joints proved to be the strongest and were twice as stiff as the other joint designs tested. Full scale panel racking shear tests were undertaken to assess the overall performance of the panels when using the screw connected joints and establish if they are suitable for load-bearing construction. Both solid panels and panels with window openings were tested. Two types of bracing were used in the test panels, either <b>corner</b> <b>bracing</b> or cross <b>bracing.</b> The <b>corner</b> <b>braced</b> panels were over twice as stiff as panels tested during a previous research project. The <b>corner</b> <b>braced</b> panels were also stiffer than the cross braced panels at the serviceability deflection limit of the panels height/ 500, and was sufficiently stiff to resist the required in plane loading under serviceability conditions. The computer model was developed alongside the structural testing. The model was developed using the Robot Millennium software package and modelled all elements of the panels apart from the straw. It was verified against the laboratory test results and found to be accurate within the serviceability deflection limit of height/ 500. Once material failure occurred in the actual panels the model’s accuracy was reduced as it does not include material failure criteria. The model was then used to undertake a parametric analysis. From this analysis it was found that all the elements modelled have an effect on the stiffness of ModCell panels. Changing the render thickness was found to make the greatest difference on the overall stiffness of the panels. Gusset plate and glued and screwed joint designs were also modelled to find their effect on panel stiffness. From all of the results of this analysis an improved panel was designed and when modelled was 20 % stiffer than the original panel...|$|R

The works studied were by the Baroque painter from Granada, Juan Sanchez-Cotin. During the study, the biological origin of these alterations was confirmed as being due to the products excreted by vespertilionid chiroptera, which roost in the summer on the <b>corner</b> <b>braces</b> of the stretchers of these paintings. These excretory substances have seriously deteriorated the images, causing blank areas and even total loss of the canvas, preparatory layer and pictorial strata. During restoration, {{it was confirmed that}} the excretory material of these bats continued to be active and hampered correct application of conservation treatments. Consequently, it proved necessary first to study and treat the excretions, which sharply lowered the pH of canvases. The zones impregnated with urine, extending from the upper to the lower braces, were neutralised, thereby stabilising the weak areas and providing satisfactory conditions for subsequent restoration treatments...|$|R

40|$|Large {{excavation}} {{projects in}} urban areas are complex geotechnical problems when it is necessary not only to ensure {{the stability of the}} excavation and support system, but also to minimize impacts on adjacent buildings and structures. These problems require more comprehensive analyses that represent the four-dimensional (space-time) processes associated with performance of the excavation support system. The goal of this research is to evaluate the use of three-dimensional finite element analysis in Plaxis 3 D 2011 to simulate ground deformations, pore pressures, and diaphragm wall deflections for the very well instrumented excavation for the basement of the Stata Center on the MIT campus. The model predictions are compared with the field measurements that include vertical inclinometers, settlement points, magnet extensometers, and piezometers. The Ray and Maria Stata Center building at MIT was designed with a basement for underground parking requiring a 42 ft deep excavation. The excavation was supported by a perimeter diaphragm wall that formed part of the permanent structure and extended 45 ft into a deep layer of underlying Boston Blue clay. The diaphragm wall was braced by a combination of prestressed tieback anchors, preloaded raker and <b>corner</b> <b>bracing</b> support elements. The control of ground movements was a critical aspect of the subsurface design due to the close proximity of the excavation to the historical MIT Alumni swimming pool building. This study has shown that the three-dimensional finite element analysis can be effectively used for such a complex excavation project and is capable to achieve reasonably consistent predictions of wall deflections, ground movements, and pore pressures for tieback, cornerbraced, and raker supported diaphragm walls despite of simplifications in the base case model. The simulation has also captured the three-dimensional effects causing the induced ground deformations to be smaller near the corner areas. Further numerical analyses are now needed to assess the importance of soil constitutive behavior on the observed field performance of the support system for the Stata Center basement. by Zhandos Y.

50|$|A Boston brace {{is a form}} of thoracolumbosacral {{orthosis}} (TLSO). It is {{the most}} commonly used brace in the United States. It is a symmetrical brace. It corrects curvature by pushing with small pads placed against the ribs, which are also used for rotational correction (here it tends to be slightly less successful, however). These pads are usually placed in the back <b>corners</b> of the <b>brace</b> so that the body is thrust forward against the brace's front, which acts to hold the body upright. The brace opens to the back, and usually runs from just above a chair's seat (when a person is seated) to around shoulder-blade height. Because of this, it is not particularly useful in correcting very high curves. It also does not correct hip misalignment, as it uses the hips as a base point. This brace is typically worn 20-23 hours a day.|$|R
40|$|Presented: 2006 - 06 - 16 Graduation date: 2007 Heavy timber framing relies {{primarily}} on bracing to withstand lateral loads due to earthquakes and wind events. Bracing configurations in heavy timber framed buildings vary widely and include cross bracing, knee bracing, and other geometries. Many heavy timber frames constructed during colonial American times are still standing, exceeding the expected life of many structures being built today. Limited {{research has been}} conducted on the lateral resistance of heavy timber frames and their connections and design aids and procedures are not readily available for engineers to assist in the design of these structures. This method of wood construction has been largely replaced with the development of light-framed wood buildings, which utilize sheathing (typically plywood or OSB) attached to the frame to resist lateral loads. Today, the primary form of wood construction is light-frame. These structures rely on shearwalls to resist lateral loads. The shearwall consists of 2 x 4 or 2 x 6 studs regularly spaced with wood structural panel sheathing attached to the wall frame. This assembly is lightweight and ductile. Extensive {{research has been conducted}} on light-frame shearwalls since the 1950 ’s. The effects of construction variables (i. e., fastener schedule, sheathing thickness and grade, anchorage, and openings) on shearwall performance have been cataloged through numerous studies. Studies have found the sheathing-frame connection, particularly the perimeter connection, is critical to the performance of a shearwall. This connection is typically nailed, although sometimes staples or adhesives are used. The lateral load path in light-frame shearwalls relies on the sheathing-framing connection. If the load path can be modified then shearwall design can more fully utilize compressive and tensile properties of the wood materials and be less sensitive to the sheathing-framing connection properties. The idea of combining bracing typical of heavy timber framing with techniques used in light-frame construction has not been widely explored by research or analysis. This study investigates the use of bracing in conjunction with light-frame construction (a hybrid framing) to relieve the sheathing nails as the critical load path and enhance the shearwall performance under lateral loading. A 4 by 8 -ft. shearwall was designed consisting of an internal cross brace without intermediate framing studs and a lapped connection at the cross intersection. A 4 x 4 top-plate was used to improve vertical capacity of the braced shearwall because no intermediate stud was included. Four different types of shearwalls were tested under cyclic loading following the CUREE protocol; a conventional light-framed shearwall, a cross-braced shearwall with no mechanical connection at the corners of the walls, a cross-braced shearwall with plywood gusset plates at the corners of the walls, and a cross-braced shearwall with metal truss plates at the corners of the walls. The conventional shearwall and the braced shearwall without mechanical connections {{at the corner of the}} wall performed similarly - the sheathing-frame connections controlled their performance. Withdrawal of the sheathing nails was the dominate failure mode. The braced shearwalls with the plywood gusset plate and the metal truss plates at the corners exhibited greater ultimate loads, greater initial stiffness and dissipated more energy compared to the conventional shearwall. The modes of failure for these walls were shear failures in the plywood gusset plates and buckling in the metal truss plates. Some failure was observed in the sheathing nails, however, to a lesser degree than observed in the conventional shearwall. The load path of vertical forces must be addressed in areas where intermediate studs are excluded due to the bracing configuration. Four additional walls were tested under vertical loading; two conventional shearwalls and two cross-braced shearwalls with metal truss plates at the <b>corners.</b> The <b>braced</b> shearwalls proved to adequately resist service level vertical loads similar to those resisted by the conventional shearwall. Overall, using a hybridized shearwall as a part of light-frame construction appears to be viable option to enhance the lateral performance...|$|R
