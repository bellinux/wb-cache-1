40|$|Many {{energetic}} {{systems can}} be activated via mechanical means. Percussion primers in small caliber ammunition and stab detonators used in medium caliber ammunition are just two examples. Current medium caliber (20 - 60 mm) munitions are detonated {{through the use of}} impact sensitive stab detonators. Stab detonators are very sensitive and must be small, as to meet weight and size limitations. A mix of energetic powders, sensitive to mechanical stimulus, is typically used to ignite such devices. Stab detonators are mechanically activated by forcing a firing pin through the <b>closure</b> <b>disc</b> of the device and into the stab initiating mix. Rapid heating caused by mechanically driven compression and friction of the mixture results in its ignition. The rapid decomposition of these materials generates a pressure/temperature pulse that is sufficient to initiate a transfer charge, which has enough output energy to detonate the main charge. This general type of ignition mix is used in a large variety of primers, igniters, and detonators. [1] Common primer mixes, such as NOL- 130, are made up of lead styphnate (basic) 40 %, lead azide (dextrinated) 20 %, barium nitrate 20 %, antimony sulfide 15 %, and tetrazene 5 %. [1] These materials pose acute and chronic toxicity hazards during mixing of the composition and later in the item life cycle after the item has been field functioned. There is an established need to replace these mixes on toxicity, health, and environmental hazard grounds. This effort attempts to demonstrate that environmentally acceptable energetic solgel coated flash metal multilayer nanocomposites can be used to replace current impact initiated devices (IIDs), which have hazardous and toxic components. Successful completion of this project will result in IIDs that include innocuous compounds, have sufficient output energy for initiation, meet current military specifications, are small, cost competitive, and perform as well as or better than current devices. We expect flash metal multilayer and sol-gel to be generic technologies applicable {{to a wide range of}} devices, especially in small caliber ammunition and sub-munitions. We will replace the NOL- 130 mixture with a nanocomposite that consists of a mechanically robust energetic multilayer foil that has been coated with a sol-gel energetic material. The exothermic reactions are activated in this nanocomposite are the transformation of the multilayer material to its respective intermetallic alloy and the thermite reaction, which is characterized by very high temperatures, a small pressure pulse, and hot particle ejection. The proposed materials and their reaction products consist of, but are not limited to aluminum, nickel, iron, aluminum oxide, titanium, iron oxide and boron. These materials have much more desirable environmental and health characteristics than the NOL- 130 composition...|$|E

40|$|Fifteen {{patients}} with internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) were examined clinically, radiographically, and electromyographically. Electromyographic recordings were also obtained from 11 subjects without signs or symptoms {{associated with their}} TMJs or masticatory musculature. All the {{patients with}} internal derangement demonstrated interferences on the ipsilateral side. This was interpreted {{as the result of}} disc displacement producing a reduced joint space and, consequently, a decreased vertical dimension on the symptomatic side. Slow opening and closing mandibular movements without clenching could be performed by healthy persons without noticeable EMG activity in the temporalis and masseter muscles. In association with disc displacement, electromyographic activity of the temporalis and masseter muscles occurred when the condyle slid over the posterior band of the disc and could be interpreted as an arthrokinetic reflex caused by distraction. Continuous muscle activity could be provoked by TMJ disc displacement and ceased when the disc position was normalized on mouth opening, only to occur again every time the disc became displaced on mouth <b>closure.</b> Anterior <b>disc</b> displacement without reduction (closed lock) could cause spastic activity in the temporalis muscle on the affected side. Spastic activity of the masseter and temporalis muscles occurring on the same side as a joint with anterior disc displacement hinders or inhibits the condylar movement necessary to achieve reduction...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPolar body {{extrusion}} (PBE) is {{the specialized}} asymmetric division by which oocytes accomplish reduction in ploidy {{and retention of}} cytoplasm. During maternal gametogenesis, as in male meiosis and mitosis, cytokinesis is accomplished by a ring rich in active Rho, myosin, and formin-nucleated F-actin [1 – 7]. However, unlike mitosis, wherein the contractile ring encircles the cell equator, the polar body ring assembles as a discoid cortical washer. Here we show that in Caenorhabditis elegans, the meiotic contractile ring transforms during <b>closure</b> from a <b>disc</b> above the spindle to a cylinder around the spindle midzone. The meiotic midbody tube comprises stacked cytoskeletal rings. This topological transition suggests a novel mechanism for constriction of an initially discoid cytokinetic ring. Analysis of mouse PBE indicates that midbody tube formation is a conserved process. Depletion of the scaffold protein anillin (ANI- 1) from C. elegans results in large and unstable polar bodies that often fuse with the oocyte. Anillin is dispensable for contractile ring assembly, initiation, and closure but {{is required for the}} meiotic contractile ring to transform from a disc into a tube. We propose that cytoskeletal bundling by anillin promotes formation of the midbody tube, which ensures the fidelity of PBE...|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{evaluate}} histomorphometrically {{the optic}} nerve head in highly myopic eyes with absolute secondary angle <b>closure</b> glaucoma.  METHODS—Optic <b>disc</b> sections of 16  highly myopic eyes with an axial length {{of more than}} 26  mm and of 19  eyes with an axial length of less than 26  mm were histomorphometrically evaluated. All eyes had been enucleated due to painful absolute secondary angle closure glaucoma.  RESULTS—In the highly myopic eyes compared with the non-highly myopic eyes, mean optic disc diameter was significantly larger (mean 2. 33  (SD 0. 55) mm versus 1. 77  (0. 50) mm; p= 0. 01), and the optic cup was significantly shallower (optic cup depth 0. 34  (0. 29) mm versus 0. 63  (0. 23) mm; p= 0. 03). The peripapillary scleral ring was significantly broader (0. 58  (0. 65) mm versus 0. 08  (0. 06) mm; p= 0. 001), and the β zone (0. 83  (0. 74) mm versus 0. 28  (0. 25) mm; p= 0. 006) of the parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy was significantly larger in the highly myopic eyes.  CONCLUSIONS—The {{results of the present}} study agree with biomorphometric data of the optic nerve head in highly myopic eyes with glaucoma. In the highly myopic group, a markedly enlarged peripapillary scleral ring characterised by absence of Bruch's membrane and choriocapillaris contributes in addition to α and β zone to the parapapillary atrophy.    Keywords: optic disc; histomorphometry; myopia; angle closure glaucom...|$|R
40|$|Abridged) Based on {{the rapidly}} {{increasing}} all-sky data of Faraday rotation measures and polarised synchrotron radiation, the Milky Way's magnetic field is now modelled with an unprecedented {{level of detail}} and complexity. We aim to complement this heuristic approach with a physically motivated, quantitative Galactic dynamo model [...] a model that moreover allows {{for the evolution of}} the system as a whole, instead of just solving the induction equation for a fixed static disc. Building on the framework of mean-field magnetohydrodynamics and extending it to the realm of a hybrid evolution, we perform three-dimensional global simulations of the Galactic <b>disc.</b> <b>Closure</b> coefficients embodying the mean-field dynamo are calibrated against resolved box simulations of supernova-driven interstellar turbulence. The emerging dynamo solutions comprise a mixture of the dominant axisymmetric S 0 mode, with even parity, and a subdominant A 0 mode, with odd parity. Notably, such a superposition of modes creates a strong localised vertical field {{on one side of the}} Galactic disc. We moreover find significant radial pitch angles, which decay with radius [...] explained by flaring of the disc. In accordance with previous work, magnetic instabilities appear to be restricted to the less-stirred outer Galactic disc. Their main effect is to create strong fields at large radii such that the radial scale length of the magnetic field increases from 4 kpc (for the case of a mean-field dynamo alone) to about 10 kpc in the hybrid models. There remain aspects (e. g., spiral arms, X-shaped halo fields, fluctuating fields) that are not captured by the current model and that will require further development towards a fully dynamical evolution. Nevertheless, the work presented demonstrates that a hybrid modelling of the Galactic dynamo is feasible and can serve as a foundation for future efforts.
