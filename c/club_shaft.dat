40|$|AbstractWe compare optical {{tracking}} with inertial tracking {{of a golf}} club for full golf swings. Previous work on tracking golf clubs with inertial measurement units (IMUs) was limited to putting applications [1]. Using a Vicon optical motion capture system and a commercial micro-electromechanical-system (MEMS) IMU, we performed simultaneous optical and inertial measurements of golf swings by one of our varsity golf team members. The IMU and five {{optical tracking}} markers were attached to a <b>club</b> <b>shaft</b> just under the grip. The position and orientation data of the grip {{can be used with}} a dynamics simulation of the <b>club</b> <b>shaft</b> and head to yield information about the club face launch conditions at the moment of ball impact [2]. Vicon marker position data, and IMU accelerations and rotation rates, were converted into laboratory frame position and orientation data for the grip of the club and compared with one another. The results point to challenges with commercial-grade IMUs that use MEMS for tracking golf swings. Strapdown inertial navigation is very sensitive to errors in the rotation rate and acceleration sensors. Due to the large dynamic ranges involved in a golf swing, and the poor noise, stability, and dynamic range of the MEMS IMUs, high-fidelity tracking of the 6 -degree-of freedom grip motion could not be achieved. We suggest that a way to overcome these challenges could be by including magnetometer data with an extended Kalman filter to provide the necessary accuracy in orientation to reconstruct the position of the club accurately in three dimensions...|$|E

A genetic algorithm was developed to optimise the coordination of the model’s mathematically represented muscles (torque generators) in order to maximise clubhead speed at impact. The kinematic and kinetic results confirmed previous findings on the proximal to distal sequencing of joints and the muscles powering those joints. The validity of the mathematical model was supported through comparisons of the model’s swing kinematics and kinetics with those of a live golfer. ...|$|E

To {{perform an}} {{epidemiological}} study {{in order to}} determine the golf-related injury locations, injury rates and possible risk factors for golf injury in amateur golfers across Australia. Method. A retrospective cross-sectional survey of Australian golf club members was used to collect data for the study. Chi-square testing was used to evaluate the association between golf injury and each possible risk factor at univariate level. All the possible risk factors were further examined in multivariate analysis using logistical regression. Results. There were 1 634 golfers included in the present study. Of these, 288 reported having had one or more golf related injuries in the previous year. The most common injury location was the lower back (25. 3 %), followed by the elbow (15. 3 %) and shoulder (9. 4 %). The most common injury mechanism was poor technique in execution of the golf swing (44. 8 %).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{determine}} how shaft stiffness affects clubhead speed and how it alters clubhead orientation at impact. For the first time, a 3 D, six-segment forward dynamics model of a golfer and club was developed and optimized to answer these questions. A range of shaft stiffness levels from flexible to stiff were evaluated at three levels of swing speed (38, 45 and 53 m/s). At any level of swing speed, the difference in clubhead speed did not exceed 0. 1 m/s across levels of shaft stiffness. Therefore, {{it was concluded that}} customizing the stiffness of a golf <b>club</b> <b>shaft</b> to perfectly suit a particular swing will not increase clubhead speed sufficiently to have any meaningful effect on performance. The magnitude of lead deflection at impact increased as shaft stiffness decreased. The magnitude of lead deflection at impact also increased as swing speed increased. For an optimized swing that generated a clubhead speed of 45 m/s, with a shaft of regular stiffness, lead deflection of the shaft at impact was 6. 25 cm. The same simulation resulted in a toe-down shaft deflection of 2. 27 cm at impact. Using the model, it was estimated that for each centimeter of lead deflection of the shaft, dynamic loft increased by approximately 0. 8 degrees. Toe-down shaft deflection had relatively no influence on dynamic loft. For every centimeter increase in lead deflection of the shaft, dynamic closing of the clubface increased by approximately 0. 7 degrees. For every centimeter increase in toe-down shaft deflection, dynamic closing of the clubface decreased by approximately 0. 5 degrees. The results from this thesis indicate that improvements in driving distance brought about by altering shaft stiffness are the result of altered clubhead orientation at impact and not increased clubhead speed...|$|E
40|$|Golf is {{a growing}} sport {{supported}} by a multi-billion dollar industry. Part of this growth {{can be attributed to}} new technologies including new training aids. Training aids address one of the major obstacles towards advancement in the sport, namely developing a controlled and consistent swing. Popular camera-based systems for golf swing measurement possess one or more major limitations including 1) extensive set-up and alignment, 2) restriction to indoor use, 3) high cost, 4) lack of portability, 5) placement of instruments (markers) on/near the club head, and 6) time-consuming data processing and analysis. This research resolves these limitations by contributing a highly portable, accurate and inexpensive means to measure golf swing dynamics. Introduced herein is a miniature and wireless six degree-of-freedom MEMS inertial measurement unit that fits entirely within the grip end of the golf <b>club</b> <b>shaft.</b> A companion measurement theory enables the computation of the rigid body dynamics of the golf club from sensor outputs. Flexible body dynamics, if and when needed, are estimated using dynamical models of flexible golf shafts. For putting strokes, the sensor system resolves the three-dimensional position of the club face to within 3 millimeters and the three-dimensional orientation of the club face to within 0. 5 degrees, both with millisecond updates. This measurement speed and significant precision enable the detailed characterization of putting strokes. A suite of “putting metrics” is identified that pin-points common putting faults from the measured club head trajectory and orientation. For full swings made with drivers and irons, the system resolves the complete three-dimensional rigid body motion of the club and critical metrics for swing instruction including the swing planes, club head velocity, and the club head orientation throughout the swing. Beyond golf, the measurement theory and hardware design hold significant promise for training systems for numerous other sports. In addition, this technology has relevance to far broader fields of application including, sports injury mechanics, rehabilitation science, gait analysis, surgeon training, etc. This research has contributed the foundation for these upcoming applications, many of which have already been initiated as a bi-product of this study...|$|E
