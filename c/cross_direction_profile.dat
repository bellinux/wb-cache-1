In this research, {{a series of}} experiments were conducted using a self-made test rig to {{study the effects of}} the strand lay <b>direction</b> and <b>crossing</b> angle on the winding rope’s tribological behavior. Results show that the friction coefficient in the steady-state period shows a decreasing tendency with an increase of the crossing angle in both <b>cross</b> <b>directions,</b> but the variation range is different under different <b>cross</b> <b>directions.</b> Using thermal imaging, the high temperature regions always distribute along the strand lay direction in the gap between adjacent strands, as the <b>cross</b> <b>direction</b> is the same with the strand lay <b>direction</b> (right <b>cross</b> contact).

40|$|Unusual among birds, {{the bill}} tips in crossbills (Loxia spp.) overlap in the {{vertical}} plane, {{with the tip}} of the lower mandible to either the left or right of the tip of the upper mandible when viewed from above. Patterns observed in wild populations and experimental foraging data suggest that a 1 : 1 ratio of left- to right-crossing individuals is maintained by frequency-dependent natural selection in some populations, and that genetic drift causes deviation from a 1 : 1 ratio in other populations. Both processes require a genetic basis for this remarkable polymorphism, yet few data are available that address whether, and how, mandible <b>crossing</b> <b>direction</b> is heritable. To test for a genetic basis of this trait (single or quantitative, autosomal or sex-linked), we analyzed resemblance in mandible <b>crossing</b> <b>direction</b> between related captive-bred individuals of several crossbill taxa with standard statistical techniques as well as modern animal model methodology. Surprisingly, we did not find statistically significant support for a genetic basis of mandible <b>crossing</b> <b>direction.</b> Comparisons of the ratio of left- to right-crossing males and females in wild populations also did not support a sex-linked quantitative genetic basis.

The effect of jet entrainement on the impingement {{heat transfer}} by unconfined jets was successfully scaled using a jet thermal entrainement factor. The addition of a confinement plate to an existing unconfined impinging jet control system was shown to improve the average heat transfer by 33 % and 80 % for a nozzle-to-impingement surface spacing of 2 and 1 respectively. The thermal deformation of calender roll under control actuators was predicted numerically using finite volume and finite element techniques. The most desirable steady state control characteristics, i. e. high peak deformation and small width of deformation, were obtained on unheated rolls of minimum practical thickness. The results indicate that control actuator spacings less than 0. 2 m provide negligible control advantage. Experiments were performed on a double calender stack of a production newsprint machine to determine the optimal position for cross-machine direction calender control actuators which would minimize the response time and maximize {{the magnitude of the}} response. Control on the queen roll and the two rolls immediately above it produces the strongest response. The king roll and the top roll, each of which affects only one nip, are shown to be poor choices for the placement of control actuators. When two calenders are used in succession, the actuators should be placed in the first stack. Calender roll design must be considered when choosing the location for control actuators...|$|R

The motion vector of myocardial can be computed using optical flow technique, which then {{can be further}} analyzed based on its magnitude and angle. In practice, physicians are not concern about the angle of vector itself, but are more interested on whether a segment is moving to the center or not. Approach: Therefore, {{in this study we}} propose a relative motion direction with respect {{to the center of the}} cardiac cavity, called radial direction, which is more useful for diagnosis. The radial direction is computed as the difference between the angle of optical flow at a point of interest and the angle between the point and the cavity center. Because of the difficulty in performing analysis based solely on individual vectors, it is helpful to visualize and extract the overall trend by representing motion vectors by their angular distribution.

40|$|Gossypium hirsutum L. is {{the most}} widely {{cultivated}} cotton species in the genus Gossypium. The genetic diversity of G. hirsutum is considerably restricted, so it is highly desirable to introgress germplasm of related species to expand opportunities for genetic improvement. Successful interspecific introgression efforts require the transmission of alien genes into the cultivated species and homologous recombination. Transmission distortion can restrict or preclude gene transfer, and reduced rates of homologous recombination can reduce or preclude recovery of desirable genetic products. Marker-based analysis of specific chromosome segments and loci during early generations of backcrossing can reveal general and locus-specific features of alien germplasm transmission and recombination with the recurrent parent, and help guide decisions for expanded analysis, subsequent backcrosses and analogous efforts with other donors. Interspecific monosomic hybrids were used to localize pre-validated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in six target chromosomes. Eventually, 67 SNPs were used to analyze transmission rates. In the present research, each "breeding situation" {{was defined as a}} unique combination of <b>cross</b> <b>direction,</b> backcross generation and cross location. Twelve G. hirsutum backcross populations were derived under different breeding situations, six from each of two alien donors, G. mustelinum and G. tomentosum. KASP analysis of the SNPs revealed {{the presence or absence of}} specific donor loci and segments in 784 individuals of the 12 populations, and was used to determine transmission rates. Linkage groups were constructed based on segregation ratios in BC 1 F 1 populations for each donor. The average transmission rate of germplasm from G. tomentosum was similar to but higher (3 %) than G. mustelinum, indicating a closer relationship of G. tomentosum with G. hirsutum. Several markers exhibited strongly distorted transmission relative to other loci of the respective linkage groups in specific populations. Several loci exhibited significant differences due to <b>cross</b> <b>direction</b> and <b>cross</b> location. Analysis of the BC 3 F 1 populations revealed the crosses from field environments were relatively favorable for transmission of alien germplasm and greenhouse environments for loss of alien germplasm.
