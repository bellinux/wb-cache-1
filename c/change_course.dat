5|$|This {{tropical}} storm was previously unidentified {{and was not}} considered a {{tropical storm}} until research by José Fernández-Partagás in 1997. The storm {{is believed to have}} originated west of the Canary Islands in the northeastern Atlantic on September 22. The tropical storm moved west-southwestward for several days, maintaining its peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h); however, the storm began to curve early on September 26 and traveled directly westward before curving northward during the afternoon. The tropical storm continued to <b>change</b> <b>course,</b> turning west-northwestward by September 28. The transitioned to an extratropical system on October 1, and reached England on October 3.|$|E
5|$|Watney {{begins the}} 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli and the pre-positioned Ares IV MAV. To {{rendezvous}} with Hermes, Watney removes many components from the MAV, including the nose cone, to lighten it, {{replacing it with}} a piece of the Hab's canvas. As the MAV fails to reach the required speed and altitude, Lewis is forced to use maneuvering thrusters to <b>change</b> <b>course</b> and explosive decompression of Hermess internal atmosphere to reduce speed. When even that is not enough, Commander Lewis uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit, but still cannot reach Watney. Watney pierces the glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air to propel himself towards Lewis, effectively rescuing him after being alone for 560 Sols on Mars.|$|E

A pretest and posttest quasi-experimental design was used for this study. Independent variable is the behavioral <b>change</b> <b>courses</b> and HPCS and it was divided into three levels: a. Control Group; b. Experiment Group One – joining the HPCS with mobile health recording device; and c. Experiment Group Two – participating in sleep behavioral <b>change</b> <b>courses</b> and HPCS with mobile health recording device. Dependent variable is students’ sleep hygiene: excessive daytime sleepiness and insomnia. The results show that after having behavioral <b>change</b> <b>courses,</b> Experiment Group Two has improved more than the other two groups on excessive daytime sleepiness and insomnia...|$|R

5|$|While on {{the move}} the lead {{vehicles}} of the patrol commanders and sergeants flew a small flag. Because the LRP was organised on divisional cavalry lines the leaders carried green flags for 'A' (HQ) Troop, black for 'B' Troop, yellow for 'C' Troop and red for 'D'. When the LRDG was organised into 11 vehicle patrols this was simplified to a green flag displaying the patrol letter in white; the later half-patrols used a plain green flag on occasion. When it became necessary to <b>change</b> <b>course</b> from an intended route, or {{in the event of}} enemy action, patrol movements were controlled by a simple semaphore flag system using blue and white signal flags, or hand signals, depending on how widely dispersed the trucks were.|$|E

25|$|The {{detached}} U-boats {{were designated}} wolfpack 'Leopard', but were soon ordered to <b>change</b> <b>course</b> {{to close a}} larger convoy spotted by wolfpack 'Wolf' about 400 miles to the west. At 05:00 on 12 October, U-353 spotted an independently sailing merchant ship of 4,000 to 5,000 tons, and closed to attack, firing two torpedoes {{from a range of}} 2,000 yards. The ship promptly altered course, and the U-boat fired another torpedo from her stern tube. Two loud explosions were heard, and the ship was seen to break in two and sink. U-353 surfaced and closed at full speed, only to find U-133 already there and claiming the victory. Eventually the two captains agreed that U-353s torpedoes had forced the ship to <b>change</b> <b>course</b> into U-133s line of fire, and they agreed to share the credit. Ten minutes later another U-boat was sighted, , which claimed to have sunk two ships. The U-boats then parted company to search for the convoy.|$|E

25|$|Particularly at Cape Fear's outlet to the Atlantic, {{the area}} was {{enclosed}} by a half dozen Confederate positions. The river flowed to the sea through two relatively shallow inlets, which were partitioned by Smith Island now Bald Head Island. The existence of two inlets resulted in a crucial advantage: guided by the Confederates, the blockade runners were capable of avoiding the Union ships. They simply had to <b>change</b> <b>course</b> unexpectedly, alternatively between the two inlets.|$|E

Two armed men, Dardo Cabo, 25, and Alejandro Giovenco, entered the flight deck and ordered Commander Ernesto Fernandez Garcia to <b>change</b> <b>course</b> toward the Falklands.

25|$|The most {{important}} factor dominating the river history in Bengal is the large proportion of silt carried by its rivers. It is the silt which has created the land and made it habitable by building it up through the centuries. It is silt which is fertilising the land, but the silt, {{which has been the}} most beneficial gift of nature, has also produced most of the river problems now confronting the people of Bengal. Silt deposited in the old river channel beds has forced them to <b>change</b> <b>course,</b> creating problems for abandoned areas while assisting in developing new areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{drainage}} {{system in the}} area was rearranged and steepened as the Waterpocket Fold was uplifted. Larger streams, such as the Fremont River, {{were more likely to}} keep up with the uplift by downcutting into the Waterpocket Fold faster. Other streams, such as Sand Creek, changed their course by flowing parallel to the fold and cutting into less resistant formations. Yet other streams tried {{to keep up with the}} uplift by carving slot canyons only to later <b>change</b> <b>course,</b> leaving their canyons literally high and dry. A total of 7,000feet (2,100m) of overlying Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediment has been removed by erosion in the area.|$|E
25|$|Since uplift {{and erosion}} {{are more or}} less in {{equilibrium}} in the Himalaya, at least where the climate is humid, rapid uplift must be balanced out by annual increments of millions tonnes of sediments washing down from the mountains; then on the plains settling out of suspension on vast alluvial fans over which rivers meander and <b>change</b> <b>course</b> at least every few decades, causing some experts to question whether manmade embankments can contain the problem of flooding.
