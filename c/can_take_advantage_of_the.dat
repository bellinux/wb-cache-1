Manual signs or gestures are frequent introduced to these children, and can {{include the use of}} fingerspelling alongside speech. Manual signs have been shown to decrease errors in articulation.

5|$|While the two fight, Strange {{activates}} Protocol 10, {{which is}} {{revealed to be}} a scheme {{to wipe out the}} entire population of Arkham City and destroy the criminal element of Gotham. TYGER troops begin executing inmates as Strange launches missile strikes on Arkham's denizens from his base in Wonder Tower. A missile hits the steelmill, burying Batman under rubble. Before Joker <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation, Talia arrives and offers him immortality in exchange for sparing Batman's life. After escaping with the help of Catwoman, Batman is convinced by Alfred to end Protocol 10 before pursuing Talia and Joker.|$|E

Association studies also <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contrasting experiences of racial or ethnic groups, including migrant groups, to search for interactions between particular alleles and environmental factors that might influence health.|$|E

25|$|The next {{generation}} of SNP annotation webservers <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growing amount of data in core bioinformatics resources and use intelligent agents to fetch data from different sources as needed. From a user’s point of view, it is more efficient to submit a set of SNPs and receive results in a single step, which makes meta-servers the most attractive choice. However, if SNP annotation tools deliver heterogeneous data covering sequence, structure, regulation, pathways, etc., they must also provide frameworks for integrating data into a decision algorithm(s), and quantitative confidence measures so users can assess which data are relevant and which are not.|$|E

The Philippine National Police has a special police force on the MRT-3, and security police provided by private companies can be found in all MRT-3 stations. All MRT-3 stations have a head guard. Some stations may also have a deployed K9 bomb-sniffing dog. The MRT-3 also employs the use of closed-circuit television inside all stations to monitor suspicious activities and to assure safety and security aboard the line.

25|$|Communal {{conflicts}} have periodically plagued India {{since it}} became independent in 1947. The roots of such strife lie {{largely in the}} underlying tensions between sections of its majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, which emerged under the Raj and during the bloody Partition of India. Such conflict also stems from the competing ideologies of Hindu nationalism versus Islamic fundamentalism; both are prevalent {{in parts of the}} Hindu and Muslim populations. This issue has plagued India since before independence. The lack of education among the masses and the ease with which corrupt politicians <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same has been attributed as the major reason for religious conflicts in India. Even though Freedom of religion {{is an integral part of}} the India constitution, the inability to hold communal mob's accountable has limited the exercise of religious freedom in India.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} views on optimal timing of surgery after a spinal cord injury. The general consensus is {{to operate the}} patient {{when he or she}} is neurologically stable. Some surgeons try to operate a patient as early as possible. The advantages of this are that the patient <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new functional possibilities before new adjustments and apaptations develop. Other surgeons operate when it becomes feasible. This is usually 12–18 months after injury (can be shortened to 6–7 months) and only after stabilization of motor function. Important spasticity (see further) and neurovegetative complications (i.e. bladder function, bowel function, pulmonary function and pressure sores) must have been treated already. The patient must be able to sit in a wheelchair so that he/she can move the arm against gravity. Usually a compromise is found between the patient’s wishes and the surgeon when timing the surgery.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, the Internet {{facilitates}} language revitalization. Throughout the years, {{the digital}} environment has developed in various sophisticated ways {{that allow for}} virtual contact. From e-mails, chats to instant messaging, these virtual environments have helped to bridge the spatial distance between communicators. The use of e-mails has been adopted in language courses {{to encourage students to}} communicate in various styles such as conference-type formats and also to generate discussions. Similarly, the use of e-mails facilitates language revitalization in the sense that speakers of a minority language who moved to a location where their native language is not being spoken <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Internet to communicate with their family and friends, thus maintaining the use of their native language. With the development and increasing use of telephone broadband communication such as Skype, language revitalization through the internet is no longer restricted to literate users.|$|E

500|$|Guitar Hero 5 {{introduces}} Career mode Challenges, {{that are}} either tied to specific songs, or allow players to select a song to meet the Challenge requirement in [...] "open gigs". These were created by Neversoft to allow the developers {{to take advantage of}} unique features of many of songs and provide another layer of gameplay, according to Neversoft's Brian Bright. Each Challenge features three possible completion levels—Gold, Platinum, and Diamond, mimicking the music recording sales certification levels—with Diamond being the most difficult to complete. The song-specific challenges include both instrument-specific challenges, such as correctly vocalizing the repeated [...] "Fame" [...] lyric at the end of David Bowie's [...] "Fame" [...] as it moves down in pitch, and more general scoring or performance challenges on either specific instruments or for the whole band. Open gig Challenges are presented by sponsors within the game, and are based on performance aspects such as scoring a certain amount of points using Star Power or using the guitar controller's whammy bar continuously for a length of time. These allow the player to select any song to complete, with some songs potentially being better suited for completing that challenge. The progress towards these Challenges is shown in-game by a record meter that appears when the challenge is active, and fills up similarly to the overall scoring meter as the player successfully completes towards the challenge. Higher completion levels, particularly Diamond, may only be possible by playing the Expert difficulty of a song, but players <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mid-song difficulty adjustment feature to complete these if needed.|$|E
