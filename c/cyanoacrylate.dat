Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E
5|$|The finder did not {{initially}} realise {{that he had}} found a Roman artefact and thought at first that it was a Victorian ornament. He eventually identified it as Roman by consulting auction catalogues, searching the Internet and getting advice from dealers. Find Liaison Officers from the Portable Antiquities Scheme were notified of the discovery and visited the findspot along with the finder. Christie's commissioned Darren Bradbury, an independent conservator and restorer, to restore the helmet and visor for sale. Although Christie's was asked to delay the restoration so that a full scientific examination could be carried out, this request was not granted and information about the helmet's burial may have been lost as a result. However, the British Museum was able to inspect the find during restoration and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry was carried out to determine the composition of the headpiece, visor and griffin. Bradbury's restoration work took some 240 hours and involved the repair of cracks and holes using resin and <b>cyanoacrylate,</b> retouched to match the appearance of the surrounding material.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{effectiveness}} of <b>cyanoacrylates</b> compared to silicone gel in improving healing of hypertrophic scars was evaluated. Patients and Methods: Patients presenting hypertrophic scars 6 to 24 months old were enrolled. Asymmetrical scars {{were treated with}} <b>cyanoacrylates,</b> linear scars were divided in two parts, one treated with <b>cyanoacrylates,</b> the other with silicone gel. For 3 months, <b>cyanoacrylates</b> were applied every 3 - 5 days, silicone gel twice a day. Patients' and external observers' assessments were recorded over one year, and photographic records taken. Objective evaluations included width, length and elevation measurements. Statistical significance of parameter modifications was analysed with the Wilcoxon test. Results: A total of 150 patients were enrolled. Positive effects of both tested products were observed without major adverse effects, achieving final scars of better quality. Scar elevation was reduced significantly for both tested products, but apparently more for topical <b>cyanoacrylates.</b> Conclusion: <b>Cyanoacrylates</b> {{have a positive effect}} on pathological scars at least comparable to that of silicone gel...|$|R

[...] These fingerprints can survive the firing processes and, while a rare occurrence, fingerprints have been obtained from cartridges recovered from the scene. Cartridges are subjected to <b>cyanoacrylate</b> fuming and examined for any usable prints. Usable prints are photographed and can be uploaded to fingerprint databases such as IAFIS for comparison with known exemplars.

500|$|Fingerprint {{recovery}} {{from the surface of}} firearms is done with <b>cyanoacrylate</b> (more commonly known as superglue) fuming. Firearms are placed in a specially designed fume hood designed to evenly distribute fumes instead of removing them. Liquid superglue is placed in a container and heated until it is in a gaseous state. The circulating fumes adhere to the oils left behind by the fingerprint, turning the print white. The resulting white print can be enhanced with fingerprint powder to increase the contrast of the white print against the weapon's finish. While using the fuming technique on recovered guns is commonplace, the recovery of fingerprints from the surfaces of a firearm is challenging due to the textured grip and the general condition of recovered weapons. [...] If fingerprints are recovered, they can be processed through fingerprint databases such as the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS). Various parts of the recovered weapon can also be tested for touch DNA left by whomever handled it. However, the low levels of DNA that can be recovered presents numerous issues such as contamination and analysis anomalies such as allele drop-out and drop-in.|$|E

500|$|The {{science of}} conserving fossil remains {{was in its}} infancy, and new {{techniques}} had to be improvised {{to deal with what}} soon became known as [...] "pyrite disease". Crystalline pyrite in the bones was being oxidized to iron sulphate, accompanied by an increase in volume that caused the remains to crack and crumble. When in the ground, the bones were isolated by anoxic moist clay that prevented this from happening, but when removed into the drier open air, the natural chemical conversion began to occur. To limit this effect, De Pauw immediately, in the mine-gallery, re-covered the dug-out fossils with wet clay, sealing them with paper and plaster reinforced by iron rings, forming in total about six hundred transportable blocks with a combined weight of a hundred and thirty tons. In Brussels after opening the plaster he impregnated the bones with boiling gelatine mixed with oil of cloves as a preservative. Removing most of the visible pyrite he then hardened them with hide glue, finishing with a final layer of tin foil. Damage was repaired with papier-mâché. This treatment had the unintended effect of sealing in moisture and extending the period of damage. In 1932 museum director Victor van Straelen decided that the specimens had to be completely restored again to safeguard their preservation. From December 1935 to August 1936 the staff at the museum in Brussels treated the problem with a combination of alcohol, arsenic, and 390 kilograms of shellac. This combination was intended to simultaneously penetrate the fossils (with alcohol), prevent the development of mold (with arsenic), and harden them (with shellac). The fossils entered a third round of conservation from 2003 until May 2007, when the shellac, hide glue and gelatine were removed and impregnated with polyvinyl acetate and <b>cyanoacrylate</b> and epoxy glues. Modern treatments of this problem typically involve either monitoring the humidity of fossil storage, or, for fresh specimens, preparing a special coating of polyethylene glycol that is then heated in a vacuum pump, so that moisture is immediately removed and pore spaces are infiltrated with polyethelene glycol to seal and strengthen the fossil.|$|E

40|$|Polymeric {{adhesives}} {{have been}} used for many applications like suture and embolization, instead of classic surgical methods or as for dental uses. In this work both subjects have been investigated and the results separated in two parts. In the first, new dentinal adhesives with different polymerizable groups (methacrylic or vinyl-ethereal) were synthesized. A low sensitivity to hydrolysis and equal or enhanced properties, compared to existing commercial products, were considered essentials. Moreover, these monomers need to polymerize by radical photopolymerization and functional groups of different characteristics were tested. All these products were characterized by microtensile bond strength test to determine the bonding strength between the adhesive and tooth. Concerning embolization, <b>cyanoacrylates</b> are nowadays the most-used adhesives in surgery. Thus, they must respond to several requirements. For instance, polymerization time and adhesive strength need to be low, to avoid diffusion of the products in the body and adhesion to the catheter. In order to overcome these problems we developed new <b>cyanoacrylates,</b> which practically instantly polymerize upon contact with blood but do not demonstrate strong adhesion to the catheter, thank to the presence of fluorine atoms, linked to the ester chain. The synthesis of these products was carried out in several steps, such as the depolymerization of the corresponding oligomers at high temperature in acid conditions. Two types of adhesion strengths were determined. Bonding strength between human veins and a microcatheter was determined in vitro by using organic materials as the most realistic model. Another test, on two layers of skin, was conducted to verify the possible use of these new <b>cyanoacrylates</b> as a glue for sutures. As a conclusion, we were able to demonstrate that some of the prepared monomers posses adhesive strength and polymerization time lower than the commercial product Glubran 2. ...|$|R
