After each successful cycle, loss of protein from immobilized beads was tested by estimating the protein from supernatant by Bradford method and no significant protein was found in it.

The encapsulation of microbial cells in <b>calcium</b> cross-linked <b>alginate</b> gel beads {{has been extensively}} studied due to several advantages over using free cells. However, industrial use of alginate gel beads has been hampered by the low structural stability of the beads. In this study, we demonstrate that the incorporation of interpenetrating covalent cross-links in an ionically cross-linked alginate gel bead significantly enhances the bead's structural durability. The interpenetrating network (IPN) was prepared by first cross-linking alginate chemically modified with methacrylic groups, termed methacrylic <b>alginate</b> (MA), with <b>calcium</b> ions and subsequently conducting a photo cross-linking reaction. The resulting methacrylic alginate gel beads (IPN-MA) exhibited higher stiffness, ultimate strength and ultimate strain and also remained more stable in media either subjected to high shear or supplemented with chelating agents than <b>calcium</b> cross-linked <b>alginate</b> gel beads. Furthermore, yeast cells encapsulated in IPN-MA gel beads remained more metabolically active in ethanol production than those in <b>calcium</b> cross-linked <b>alginate</b> gel beads.

25|$|Alginate is a {{polysaccharide}} that readily forms chains; {{it can be}} cross-linked at its carboxylic {{groups with}} multivalent cations such as Cu2+, Ca2+, or Al3+ to form a more mechanically stable hydrogel. <b>Calcium</b> <b>alginates</b> form polymers that are both biocompatible and non-immunogenic and {{have been used in}} tissue engineering applications. However, they are unable to support longitudinally oriented growth, which is necessary for reconnection of the proximal end with its target. In order to overcome this problem, anisotropic capillary hydrogels (ACH) have been developed. They are created by superimposing aqueous solutions of sodium alginate with aqueous solutions of multivalent cations in layers. After formation, the electrolyte ions diffuse into the polymer solution layers, and a dissipative convective process causes the ions to precipitate, creating capillaries. The dissipative convective process results the opposition of diffusion gradients and friction between the polyelectrolyte chains. The capillary walls are lined with the precipitated metal alginate, while the lumen is filled with the extruded water.|$|R

Enzymatically treated alginate caused less fouling on both ultrafiltration and microfiltration membranes than original alginate. Enzymatically treated alginate is predicted to cause less fouling on both membranes within the pH range of approximately 3. 0 to approximately 10. 0. Without the presence of <b>calcium</b> cation, <b>alginate</b> lyase reduced the foulant resistance by more than 82 % for both membranes. In the presence of 1 mM <b>calcium</b> cation, <b>alginate</b> lyase reduced the foulant resistance by more than 55 %.

50|$|The {{processes}} for {{the manufacture of}} sodium alginate from brown seaweeds fall into two categories: 1) <b>Calcium</b> <b>alginate</b> method and, 2) Alginic acid method. The chemistry of the processes used to make sodium alginate from brown seaweeds is relatively simple. The difficulties of the processes arise from the physical separations which are required, such as the need to filter slimy residues from viscous solutions or to separate gelatinous precipitates which hold large amounts of liquid within the structure and which resist filtration and centrifugation.|$|E
50|$|An {{immobilized enzyme}} is an enzyme {{attached}} to an inert, insoluble material—such as <b>calcium</b> <b>alginate</b> (produced by reacting {{a mixture of}} sodium alginate solution and enzyme solution with calcium chloride). This can provide increased resistance to changes in conditions such as pH or temperature. It also lets enzymes be held in place throughout the reaction, following which they are easily separated from the products and may be used again - a far more efficient process and so is widely used in industry for enzyme catalysed reactions. An alternative to enzyme immobilization is whole cell immobilization.|$|E

40|$|Sodium {{alginate}} is {{a useful}} polymer for the encapsulation and immobilization {{of a variety of}} cells in tissue engineering because it is biocompatible, biodegradable and easy to process into injectable microbeads. Despite these properties, little is known of the efficacy of <b>calcium</b> cross-linked <b>alginate</b> gel beads as a biodegradable scaffold for osteogenic cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we investigated the ability of rabbit derived bone marrow cells (BMCs) to proliferate and differentiate in alginate microbeads and compared them with BMCs cultured in poly-l-lysine (PLL) coated microbeads and on conventional 2 D plastic surfaces. Results show that levels of proliferation and differentiation in microbeads and on tissue culture plastics were comparable. Cell proliferation in microbeads however diminished after fortification with a coating layer of PLL. Maximum cell numbers observed were, 3. 32 × 105 ± 1. 72 × 103; 3. 11 × 105 ± 1. 52 × 103 and 3. 28 × 10 5 ± 1. 21 × 103 for the uncoated, PLL coated and plastic surface groups respectively. Alkaline phosphatase and protein expressions reflected the stage of cell differentiation. We conclude that <b>calcium</b> cross-linked <b>alginate</b> microbeads can act as a scaffold for BMC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation and has potential for use as 3 D degradable scaffold. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

This membrane contains an endogenous population of pluripotent cells called the periosteal cells, which are a type of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which reside in the cambium layer, i.e., the side facing the bone. A key step in the procedure is the elevation of the periosteum without damaging the cambium surface and to ensure this a new technique called hydraulic elevation was developed.|$|E

50|$|The {{interactions}} between proteins and carbohydrates {{plays an important}} role in the viscosity of processed spreads. More specifically, sodium alginate contributes to the integrity of the gel-like network formed by the casein and salts. The newly formed network is made possible through cation binding, which converts the hydrophilic sodium alginate into hydrophobic <b>calcium</b> <b>alginate</b> (Ma). Guluronic acid residues that are linked together demonstrate a high affinity for calcium ions. Sodium alginate works in conjunction with the destabilization of the casein micelle where calcium ions can interact with guluronic chains (Ma). Due to a mixture of these interactions, a gel-like structure is formed rather than a true gel structure.|$|E
50|$|The {{goal of the}} {{extraction}} process is to obtain dry, powdered, sodium alginate. The calcium and magnesium salts do not dissolve in water; the sodium salt does. The rationale behind {{the extraction}} of alginate from the seaweed is to convert all the alginate salts to the sodium salt, dissolve this in water, and remove the seaweed residue by filtration. The alginate must then be recovered from the aqueous solution. The solution is very dilute and evaporation of the water is not economic. To the sodium alginate from the initial extraction solution, a calcium salt is added. This causes <b>calcium</b> <b>alginate</b> to form with a fibrous texture; it does not dissolve in water and can be separated from it with relative ease using a metal screen.|$|E

Flow cytometry data showed that mESCs cryopreserved in RGDS-alginate beads had a higher expression of stem cell markers compared with cells cryopreserved in suspension or cells cryopreserved in unmodified alginates. Cell viability after thawing was assessed using trypan blue exclusion assay and monitored using Alamar blue assay for 6 hours. It was shown that post-thaw cell survival rate was significantly higher for cells encapsulated in RGDS-modified alginate (93 ± 2 percent, mean and standard error) than those in suspension (52 ± 2 percent) or in unmodified alginates (62 ± 3 percent). These results showed that cells encapsulated and attached to a substratum have better survival rate and stem cell marker expression 24 hours after cryopreservation than those in suspension.
