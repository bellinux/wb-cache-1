25|$|While {{the use of}} the {{calendar}} appears to have spread southward to Sukhothai and eastward to Laotian states in the following centuries, the official adoption farther south by the Ayutthaya Kingdom and farther east by Lan Xang came only after King Bayinnaung's conquests of those kingdoms in the 16th century. Subsequent Siamese kingdoms retained the Burmese calendar as the official calendar under the name of Chulasakarat (Pali: Culāsakaraj) until 1889. The Siamese adoption {{turned out to be the}} main catalyst for {{the calendar}}'s usage in Cambodia, a periodic vassal of Siam between the 16th and 19th centuries. Likewise, the <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> to the Chittagong region of Bengal, which was dominated by the Arakanese Mrauk-U Kingdom from the 15th to 17th centuries.|$|E

50|$|The <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> {{can be used}} {{to attempt}} to take {{advantage}} of a difference in the implied volatilities between two different months' options. The trader will ordinarily implement this strategy when the options he is buying have a distinctly lower implied volatility than the options he is writing (selling).|$|E

50|$|Futures {{calendar}} spreads or switches represent simultaneous {{purchase and}} sales in different delivery months, and are quoted as {{the difference in}} prices. If gold for August delivery is bid $1601.20 asking $1601.30, and gold for October delivery is bid $1603.20 asking $1603.30, then the <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> would be bid -$2.10 asking -$1.90 for August-October.|$|E
50|$|If the trader instead buys {{a nearby}} month's options in some {{underlying}} market and sells that same underlying market's further-out options {{of the same}} striking price, {{this is known as}} a reverse <b>calendar</b> <b>spread.</b> This strategy will tend strongly to benefit from a decline in the overall implied volatility of that market's options over time.|$|E
5000|$|When market {{conditions}} crumble, options become {{a valuable tool}} to investors. While many investors tremble {{at the mention of}} the word [...] "options", there are many option strategies {{that can be used to}} help reduce the risk of market volatility. In this article we are going to examine the many uses of the <b>calendar</b> <b>spread.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{identify}} factors that affect the profitability and risk of trading futures <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads.</b> The basic characteristics of futures and trading <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads</b> with seasonal time frames are described {{in the first part}} of the thesis. The selected factors such as the correlation of short-term and long-term seasonal patterns, the trading in the extreme, the trading single or multiple crops, the width of the seasonal window, the win probability, the length of backtested period and intermarket vs. intramarket spreads are analyzed from the perspective of profitability and risk in the second part. A summary of the results is contained in the conclusion...|$|R
50|$|The {{calendar}} call spread (see <b>calendar</b> <b>spread)</b> is a bullish {{strategy and}} consists of selling a put option with a shorter expiration against a purchased call option with an expiration further out in time. The calendar call spread is basically a leveraged version of the covered call (see above), but purchasing long call options instead of purchasing stock.|$|E
50|$|In Derivatives trading, a term {{diagonal}} spread {{is applied to}} an options spread position that shares features of both a <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> and a vertical spread. It is established by simultaneously buying and selling equal amount of option contracts of the same type (call options or put options) but with different strike prices and expiration dates.|$|E
50|$|In finance, a <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> (also {{called a}} time spread or {{horizontal}} spread) is a spread trade involving the simultaneous purchase of futures or options expiring {{on a particular}} date and {{the sale of the}} same instrument expiring on another date. The legs of the spread vary only in expiration date; they are based on the same underlying market and strike price.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis are futures spreads, more {{specifically}} trading strategies based on two approaches - cointegration tested on inter-commodity spreads and seasonality observed amongst <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads.</b> Commodity pairs which we identify to be cointegrated are tested for four mean reversion strategies, three of them being based on fair value approach, the fourth on the relative value approach. Similarly <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads</b> exhibiting seasonality are optimized for naive buy and hold trading strategies. Both approaches are tested on in-sample and out-of-sample data. Amongst seasonal strategies we have not found a pattern yielding sufficiently profitable signals in both in-sample and out-of-sample periods. Inter-commodity spreads on the other returned profitable strategies on cointegrated spreads which were also similar in physical nature. The exception to that rule were spreads known well in the industry, which failed to deliver positive results in the out-of-sample period...|$|R

50|$|If, on {{the other}} hand, the spread between a future traded on an {{underlying}} asset and the spot price of the underlying asset was set to widen, possibly due to a rise in short-term interest rates, then an investor would be advised to sell the spread (i.e. a <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> where the trader sells the near-dated instrument and simultaneously buys the future on the underlying).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Calendar</b> <b>spread</b> - Buying {{simultaneously}} a put {{and call}} option on either a bearish, bullish, or neutral trade. These can be [...] "rolled" [...] into several months, and even combined up to 3 Calendar spreads in one stock for one position. This can be called a type of hedging strategy. Traders never sell Calendars for a credit unless it's to take the position off and collect a debit (profit). Looks similar to a Condor.|$|E
50|$|Bullish options {{strategies}} are employed when the options trader expects the underlying stock price to move upwards. They {{can also use}} Theta (time decay) with a bullish/Bearish combo called a <b>Calendar</b> <b>Spread</b> and not even rely on stock movement. The trader can also just assess how high the stock price can go and the time frame in which the rally will occur in order to select the optimum trading strategy for just buying a bullish option.|$|E
50|$|The last risk {{to avoid}} when trading <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads</b> is an {{untimely}} entry. In general, market timing {{is much less}} critical when trading spreads, but a trade that is very ill-timed {{can result in a}} max loss very quickly. Therefore, it is important to survey the condition of the overall market and to make sure you are trading within the direction of the underlying trend of the stock.|$|R
50|$|A {{great deal}} of the trading on these {{contracts}} is exchange traded multi-leg strategies, essentially bets upon the future shape of the yield curve and/or basis. Both Liffe and CME allow direct exchange trading in <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads</b> (the order book for spreads is separate from that of the underlying futures), which are quoted in terms of implied prices (price differences between futures of different expiries). Exchange-traded futures spreads greatly reduce execution risk and slippage, allowing traders to place guaranteed limit orders for entire spreads, otherwise impossible when entering into spreads via two separate futures orders.|$|R
40|$|This paper conducts an {{empirical}} {{analysis of the}} mispricing of <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads</b> for stock index futures. Using recent data drawn from the Sydney Futures Exchange, {{a sharp increase in}} the magnitude of spread mispricing immediately prior to maturity of the near contract is documented. This pattern in mispricing is related to a sharp decline in open interest in the near contract and an increase in open interest in the deferred contract. Further, the direction of mispricing of the near and deferred contracts are more likely to move in opposite directions as the near contract approaches maturity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that traders seeking to roll-over their positions from near to deferred futures contracts close to maturity increase the magnitude of spread mispricing. 19 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|For traders who own {{calls or}} puts against a stock, {{they can sell}} an option against this {{position}} and [...] "leg" [...] into a <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> at any point. For example, if you own calls on a particular stock and it has made a significant move to the upside but has recently leveled out, you can sell a call against this stock if you are neutral over the short term. Traders can use this legging-in strategy to ride out the dips in an upward trending stock.|$|E
50|$|If {{short-term}} interest rates were expected to fall in a contango market, this would narrow the spread between a futures contract and an underlying asset in good supply. This is because the cost of carry will fall due to the lower interest rate, which in turn results in {{the difference between the}} price of the future and the underlying growing smaller (i.e. narrowing). An investor would be advised to buy the spread in these circumstances: this is a <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> trade where the trader buys the near-dated instrument and simultaneously sells the far-dated instrument (i.e. the future).|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the risk and}} return {{of a wide variety}} of trading strategies involving options on the S&P 500. We consider naked and covered positions, straddles, strangles, and <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads,</b> with different maturities and levels of moneyness. Overall, we ﬁnd that strategies involving short positions in options generally compensate the investor with very high Sharpe ratios, which are statistically signiﬁcant even after taking into account the non-normal distribution of returns. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the strategies’ returns are substantially higher than warranted by asset pricing models. We also ﬁnd that the returns of the strategies could only be justiﬁed by jump risk if the probability of market crashes were implausibly higher than it has been historically. We conclude that the returns of option strategies constitute a very good deal. However, exploiting this good deal is extremely diffcult. We ﬁnd that trading costs and margin requirements severely condition the implementation of option strategies. Margin calls force investors out of a trade precisely when it is losing money. Taking margin calls into account turns the Sharpe ratio of some of the best strategies negative...|$|R

40|$|Recent rapidly {{rising and}} {{volatile}} energy commodities prices and financial price manipulation scandals {{have brought the}} pricing mechanisms of crude oil derivatives to the fore of both popular press and policy initiatives. Among {{the most important of}} such commodities is Brent Crude. Brent Crude and its complex of derivative products make Brent Crude potentially more opaque and thus susceptible to price manipulation than other commodities. In spite of the importance of Brent to the world economy and world energy prices, and its complex of derivative pricing, relatively little work has been done to explore the potential for, and evidence of, price manipulation in the Brent Crude complex. This paper seeks to address this lack by proposing a method to test whether price squeezes have occurred in Brent Crude. This paper builds on previous work which proposed an a priori test for evidence of manipulation and the theory of storage. Previous work (Barrera-Rey and Seymour 1996) posited that the very close-to-delivery end of the forward curve for Brent should not be simultaneously in contango and backwardation, while other work (Geman and Smith 2012) proposed using an econometric prediction and a model based on the theory of storage to detect manipulation in commodity markets. Our work builds on these approaches by developing a more detailed model of <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads</b> in the Brent Crude complex. In Brent, a particular area of potential manipulation is from the relatively illiquid and more opaque physical OTC forward market (where prices are ‘assessed’ by Platts during a short ‘window’ of time) and the more liquid ICE futures market. Our model relates prompt ICE futures <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads</b> to prompt-over-dated OTC forward spreads. The model then tests whether the a priori indicators of manipulation as suggested by Barrera-Rey and Seymour are statistically consistent with the process which drives spreads historically. We find that in most all cases, the indicated period of manipulation is statistically different. We further investigate whether other factors, such as liquidity (volume and open interest) or world oil market conditions (using WTI spreads) or other forward market conditions could be driving our results. The statistical difference is found to be invariant to the inclusion of these other explanatory variables. We conclude that the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis of price manipulation and that the test provides a model and method for detecting such cases. ...|$|R
50|$|In summary, it is {{important}} to remember that a long <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> is a neutral - and in some instances a directional - trading strategy that is used when a trader expects a gradual or sideways movement in the short term and has more direction bias over the life of the longer-dated option. This trade is constructed by selling a short-dated option and buying a longer-dated option, resulting in a net debit. This spread can be created with either calls or puts, and therefore can be a bullish or bearish strategy. The trader wants to see the short-dated option decay at a faster rate than the longer-dated option.|$|E
5000|$|A {{common use}} of the <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> is to [...] "roll over" [...] an expiring {{position}} into the future. When a futures contract expires, its seller is nominally obliged to physically deliver some quantity of the underlying commodity to the purchaser. In practice, this is almost never done; {{it is far more}} convenient for both buyers and sellers to settle the trade financially rather than arrange for physical delivery. This is most commonly done by entering into an offsetting position in the market. For example, someone who has sold a futures contract can effectively cancel the position out by purchasing an identical futures contract, and vice versa.|$|E

5000|$|As another example, [...] "buying the Cal 13-12, SP-NP box spread", {{would be}} buying power at CAISO hub SP versus selling power at CAISO hub NP for 2013, while also doing the {{opposite}} (so, selling at SP and buying at NP) for 2012. (In some markets, a leg that is purchased is mentioned before a leg that is sold and commonly {{the more expensive}} leg is also mentioned first (to avoid using a negative spread price). Therefore, {{the way that the}} CAISO box spread is referred to suggests that SP is trading over NP, and SP-minus-NP is wider in 2013 than in 2012). Another pair of contracts that commonly trade box spreads are WTI and Brent crude oil, either in the form of intra-commodity <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads</b> for WTI and Brent using the same calendar expirations for each or different expiration WTI/Brent inter-commodity spreads. One motivation for trading a box would be to roll an existing two-leg spread position to another (typically later) time period. E.g., to roll one's existing 2012 SP-NP spread position out to 2013 (i.e., close 2012 and replace with 2013), or to trade the box spread itself by taking a view {{that there will be a}} widening or narrowing of the spread within the box itself.|$|R
