40|$|The {{periodontal}} pack {{is often}} used to cover the surgical site after surgery, even when associated with local applications of preparations containing <b>chlorexidine,</b> in order to obtain an antiseptic protection. However many people question whether the drug effectively succeeds in penetrating the pack, or if the presence of the pack itself doesn't obstruct the action of the medication. The aim of this work is to evaluate the efficiency of the clorexidine in the surgical area with and without a periodontal pack. In a first stage, a case was chosen and contemporary operated on in two different but anatomically similar sites at the same time. One of the two sites was covered with a <b>chlorexidine</b> gel for the following week, whilst the other was left without medication. After seven days the stitches removed from the two different sites were placed in culture mediums to number and classify the bacterial strains present. In the second stage of the experiment, another eight patients were operated on in the same way, and the two sites covered with periodontal packs. In one of the two sites a layer of <b>chlorexidine</b> gel was positioned under the pack, and the <b>chlorexidine</b> above and {{on the sides of the}} pack was continually renewed throughout the week following the operation. The other site was not treated. The results obtained show that the pack partially reduces the action of the drug medication, probably because an insufficient amount reaches the site.

40|$|The cones of {{gutta-percha}} are {{the main}} root canal filling materials. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of some products in the decontamination of these cones. Eighty (80) cones of gutta-percha # 40,separated in 8 groups with 10 cones each one, have been used as sampling. Seventy cones have been contaminated with Enterecoccus faecalis for immersion in saline solution contends 105 to 108 bacterial cells/mL. The groups have suffered decontamination for G 1 : alcohol 70 %; G 2 : alcohol 70 % + iodine 1 %; G 3 : alcohol 70 % + <b>chlorexidine</b> 4 %; G 4 : <b>chlorexidine</b> 4 %; G 5 : NaOCl 2, 5 %; G 6 : NaOCl 5, 25 %; G 7 : saline solution; G 8 : it was not contaminated and it did not suffer decontamination (control). After 1 minute in contact with each product, five (5) cones have been removed,washed in sterile saline solution and introduced individually in tubes containing BHI solution. The other cones have been removed after 5 minutes in contact with the solutions, repeating the same process of the previous ones. The set of tubes have been agitated per 1 minute and taken to the sterilizer and kept there at 37 ºC for 48 hours. The tubes that presented turbidity of BHI solution have been considered positive.

Eighty-eight patients currently or previously treated with NBPs were selected for extractions of compromised teeth. Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the risk of BRONJ. Patients were subdivided in high risk (HR) group (i. v. NBPs administration) and in low risk (LR) group (i. m. /oral NBPs administration > 36 months or oral NBPs < 36 month plus other risk factors). Tooth extractions were carried out using the following surgical-pharmacological protocol: 1) exposure of the alveolar bone through the creation of surgical edges; 2) nontraumatic avulsion, courettage of the area, irrigation of the alveolus with a local antibiotic and 3) closure by primary intention. Furthermore, all patients received a pre- and post-operative pharmacological therapy. The antibiotic systemic therapy was different for HR and LR patients. For HR, the antibiotic systemic therapy based on administration of ampicillin and sulbactam by i. v. and metronidazole per os (1 day pre-operative and 7 days post-operative); for LR patients, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and metronidazole per os (1 day pre-operative and 7 days post- operative). For both groups, the use of antiseptic (<b>chlorexidine</b> 0, 2...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar qualitativamente a contaminação microbiana de dispositivos auriculares do arco facial, articuladores semi-ajustáveis e in vivo os condutos auditivos externos antes e após anti-sepsia com clorexidina 0, 2 % de pacientes da Clínica de Odontologia da FORP-USP. Foi realizado um plano piloto com 20 articuladores (ramo {{superior}} e ramo inferior) e 20 dispositivos auriculares (direito e esquerdo) da clínica de graduação da FORP-USP em dois tempos, início do ano letivo e final do ano letivo. Para os articuladores um swab embebido em salina era esfregado numa área de 4, 0 cm² delimitada por template; para o dispositivo auricular o swab era esfregado ao redor deste e então colocados em tubos de ensaio contendo 1, 0 ml de salina. Após agitar os tubos, a suspensão era semeada em Agar Tioglicolato e o restante da salina enriquecido com caldo Tioglicolato e incubado a temperatura ambiente por no mínimo três dias para verificação do crescimento microbiano. Foram avaliados também 20 articuladores após desinfecção previa da área delimitada com álcool 70 % esfregada com gaze esterilizada por três vezes. Vinte arco faciais (40 dispositivos - direito e esquerdo) fornecidos pela BioArt (São Carlos - SP) foram avaliados após esterilização e uso em paciente. O dispositivo esterilizado era encaixado com auxílio do próprio papel da embalagem de esterilização e colocado no conduto auditivo externo pelo paciente por dois minutos. A seguir o dispositivo era removido com mão enluvada e colocado em tubo de ensaio contendo 1, 0 ml de salina. O restante do {{material e}} método foi igual ao plano piloto. Foi avaliada a contaminação microbiana de condutos auditivos externos de 20 pacientes; antes da anti-sepsia um swab umedecido em salina era esfregado pelo paciente e após anti-sepsia, um cotonete embebido em clorexidina 0, 2 % era esfregado por 30 segundos pelo paciente no conduto auditivo externo e a colheita do material era feita após com um swab embebido em salina. O restante do material e método foi igual aos demais grupos. Foi feita a coloração de Gram para identificação dos morfotipos e os cocos gram-positivos (Staphylococcus) semeados em Kit Api Staph (BioMerieux) e os bacilos gram-positivos esporulados e bacilos gram-negativos em serie de Hiss convencional (em tubos). Os cocos foram identificados como: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus roseus, Staphylococcus asaccharolyticus, Staphylococcus minimus, e ainda Kokuria ryzophyla; os bacilos gram-positivos aerobios esporulados como: Bacillus atropheus, Bacillus acnes, Bacillus alvei e o único bacilo gram-negativo como: Alcaligenes faecalis. Baseado nos resultados verificou-se que todos os ramos superiores e inferiores dos articuladores testados e dispositivos auriculares (direito e esquerdo) do arco facial do plano piloto estavam contaminados não havendo diferença estatisticamente significante entre os dois tempos; após desinfecção com álcool 70 % dos 20 articuladores testados apenas 4 estavam contaminados (media de UFC foi 7); todos os dispositivos auriculares esterilizados avaliados após uso em paciente estavam contaminados; não houve diferença estatisticamente significante na contaminação microbiana entre os condutos auditivos externos direito e esquerdo tanto antes quanto após a anti-sepsia com clorexidina 0, 2 %. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the microbiological quality of the face bow earpieces, articulators and in vivo the external auditory canals before and after antisepsis with <b>chlorexidine</b> 0, 2 % of patients from the clinic of Dentistry of FORP-USP. It was done a pilot study with twenty articulators (superior and inferior branch) and twenty earpieces (right and left) from the Clinic of Dentistry of FORP-USP, twice, one in the beginning of the school year and the other in the end of the school year. For the articulators a swab moistened with saline was scratched in a 4, 0 cm 2 area delimited by template; for the earpieces a swab was scratched around it and then placed in tube test with 1, 0 ml saline. After agitating, the suspension was inoculated in Tioglicolate Agar (DIFCO) and incubated in ambient temperature at least three days to verify the bacterial growth. It was also evaluated the microbiological quality of twenty articulators after previous disinfection of the delimited area with alcohol 70 % scratched with sterilized gauze for three times. Twenty face bows (40 earpieces - right and left) were evaluated after sterilization and used in patients. The face bow and the earpieces were provided by BioArt (Sao Carlos - SP). The earpieces were incased with the paper where they were sterilized and placed in the external auditory canal by the patient for two minutes. Then, the earpieces were transferred with gloved hand to a tube test with 1, 0 ml saline. The rest of the material and methods were the same of the pilot study. It was evaluated in vivo the microbiological quality of the external auditory canals of twenty patients; before the antisepsis a swab moistened with saline was scratched by the patient and after the antisepsis, a swab moistened with <b>chlorexidine</b> 0, 2 % was scratched for 30 seconds by the patient in the external auditory canal and the material was collected after the antisepsis with a swab moistened with saline. The rest of material and methods were the same of the other groups. A Gram stain was done in order to obtain the microorganisms identification with the biochemical test by the ApiStaph System (Bio Merieux) for Staphylococcus that was identified as: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus roseus, Staphylococcus asaccharolyticus, Staphylococcus minimus, and still Kokuria ryzophyla. The spore forming aerobic Gram-positive bacilli were identified by conventional tube test as: Bacillus atropheus, Bacillus acnes, Bacillus alvei and only Gram-negative bacilli as Alcaligenes faecalis. Based on the results, it was verified that almost all of the articulators branches (superior and inferior) tested and the face bow earpieces (right and left) of pilot study were contaminated, there was not a difference statistically significant between both times; after disinfection with alcohol 70 % form the only four out of the twenty tested articulators were contaminated (UFC= 7); all of the sterilized earpieces evaluated after being used in patients were contaminated, there was not a difference statistically significant in the microbiological quality between the external auditory canals right and left either before or after the antisepsis with <b>chlorexidine</b> 0, 2 %...|$|E
40|$|Large {{quantities}} of disinfectants {{are used in}} hospitals, externally on human skin or to eliminate microorganisms from inanimate objects. After use, residual {{quantities of}} these products reach the wastewater, exposing the bacteria that survive in hospital wastewaters {{to a wide range}} of biocides that could act as a selective pressure for the development of resistance. Increasing attention has been directed recently to the resistance of bacteria to disinfectants. The aim of this paper was to determine the disinfectant bacterial resistance pattern of the microflora released to the urban sewer system by hospital effluents. The characterization of the waste water microflora was performed by determination of the CFU of heterotrophic bacteria, fecal indicator bacteria, Pseudomonas sp. and Staphylococcus sp., in a Buenos Aires hospital effluent. The bacterial resistance to the disinfectants more frequently used in the hospital practice, glutaraldehyde, chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine, was then evaluated. Disinfectant resistant bacterial strains were isolated and typified. Between 10 ³ and 10 (6) <b>chlorexidine</b> resistant bacteria/ 100 mL were isolated from the samples. Bacteria resistant to other disinfectants ranged between 10 ³ and 10 (4) / 100 mL. The bacterial population resistant to desinfectants to was mainly composed by Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus spp, and Bacillus spp, which are highly associated to nosocomial infections. The results obtained show that the hospital effluents are of importance in the bacterial resistance selection process, particularly in the case of disinfectants. Os hospitais utilizam uma grande quantidade de desinfetantes para eliminar microorganismos tanto da pele humana como de superfícies inanimadas. Após sua utilização, esses produtos podem chegar ao esgoto em quantidades residuais. A pressão seletiva exercida pelos antimicrobianos nos efluentes hospitalares propicia a disseminação de linhagens resistentes. Além dos antibióticos, os desinfetantes podem atuar como agentes seletivos de linhagens resistentes aos antimicrobianos. Este trabalho teve como objetivo o estudo do perfil da resistência aos desinfetantes das bactérias lançadas na rede de esgoto pelo efluente hospitalar. Na caracterização microbiológica do efluente do Hospital de Clínicas Buenos Aires, determinou-se a concentração de bactérias heterotróficas, bactérias indicadoras fecais, Pseudomonas sp. e Staphylococcus sp. presentes. A resistência aos desinfetantes empregados no hospital, glutaraldeído, iodo povidona, e clorexidina foi então avaliada. Verificou-se a existência de bactérias resistentes à clorexidina em número variando de 10 ³ a 10 (6) bactérias/ 100 mL e de bactérias resistentes a outros desinfetantes em uma faixa de variação de 10 ³ a 10 (4) bactérias/ 100 mL. Bactérias dos gêneros Staphylococcus e Bacillus, e da família Enterobacteriaceae, envolvidas em infecções hospitalares, apresentaram resistência aos desinfetantes testados. Estes resultados indicam que as águas residuárias de hospitais desempenham um papel de grande relevância na disseminação de linhagens bacterianas resistentes aos desinfetantes no meio aquático...|$|E
40|$|A pele da teta é uma das principais fontes de contaminação microbiana do leite cru, além de ser uma fonte de infecção da glândula mamária. Este estudo comparou diferentes métodos de preparação do úbere, incluindo a participação do bezerro para estimular a descida do leite, em relação à contaminação microbiana da pele da teta. Um experimento com 36 vacas ordenhadas mecanicamente foi conduzido para comparar três procedimentos (A, B, C) de preparação do úbere. Duas tetas de cada vaca foram amostradas para contagem total de bactérias (CTB) e de coliformes, antes e após lavagem com água e secagem com papel toalha descartável (A); procedimento A, mais imersão das tetas em solução de iodo (4. 000 ppm) e secagem com papel toalha descartável (B); higienização com toalha de papel embebida em solução desinfetante contendo clorexidina (C). O segundo experimento incluiu 16 vacas ordenhadas manualmente, na presença do bezerro. Permitiu-se a cada bezerro mamar as quatro tetas por alguns segundos, de acordo com o manejo do rebanho. Amostras para bacteriologia de duas tetas de cada vaca foram coletadas, antes, após a mamada do bezerro, e após higienização semelhante ao procedimento C, citado acima. Os tratamentos foram analisados usando-se o teste não- paramétrico de Kruskal-Wallis, considerando-se os dados de tCTB após o uso de um dos métodos de preparação do úbere ou da mamada do bezerro. Usou-se a transformação das contagens bacterianas para a escala logarítmica em base 10, com a fórmula tCTB=log 10 (CTB+ 0, 5). Para os grupos A, B e C (primeiro experimento), os valores médios de diminuição de tCTB foram 1, 8, 2, 2 e 2, 4, respectivamente. No segundo experimento, as CTB's aumentaram significativamente (P The teat skin {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{microbial}} contamination of raw milk as well as a source of mastitis infection. This study assessed the microbial load of the teat skin following the application of the different practices for preparing the udder, including the use of calf suckling to stimulate the letdown of milk. Thirty-six cows milked by machine were included in one experiment. Two teats of each cow were sampled for bacteriology before and after using one of three methods of udder preparation, as follows: rinsing with water and drying with single paper towels (A); method A plus pre-dipping with an iodine teat dip (4, 000 ppm) and drying with single paper towels (B); wiping teats using a commercial wet non-woven wipe pre-soaked with a solution containing <b>chlorexidine</b> (C). The second experiment included 16 cows milked by hand. The calf of each cow was allowed to suck the four teats for a few seconds, and then two teats per cow were sampled for bacteriology. Samples were collected before, after calf sucking and following teat pre-milking treatment (as for group C, above). Statistical analysis was conducted on transformed (log 10) data with tTBC=log 10 (TBC+ 0. 5) using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Each treatment was analysed considering the difference in tTBC after the use of either method of preparation of the udder or calf sucking. For groups A, B and C (first experiment), tTBC values were reduced 1. 8, 2. 2 and 2. 4, respectively. In the second experiment, tTBC increased significantly (P< 0, 05) after calf sucking (from 3. 2 to 4. 3). After disinfection the tTBC was significantly reduced to 2. 0. These results show that: (a) teat rinsing with water and wiping dry reduces the number of microorganisms on the teat skin, but the reduction is significantly higher when teats are disinfected; (b) calf sucking before milking increases significantly the number of microorganisms on teat skin; (c) the number of microorganisms on teat skin can be reduced more than 10 times after calf sucking if teats are disinfected. Very low numbers or no growth of coliforms were observed in all cases...|$|E
