50|$|Historically, {{members of}} ETA have taken refuge in France, {{particularly}} the French Basque Country. The leadership have typically chosen {{to live in}} France for security reasons, where police pressure is much less than in Spain. Accordingly, ETA's tactical approach had been to downplay the issue of independence of the French Basque country so as to get French acquiescence for their activities. The French government quietly tolerated the group, especially during Franco's regime, when ETA members could {{face the death penalty}} in Spain. In the 1980s, the advent of the GAL still hindered <b>counter-terrorist</b> <b>cooperation</b> between France and Spain, with the French government considering ETA a Spanish domestic problem. At the time, ETA members often travelled between the two countries using the French sanctuary as a base of operations.|$|E
40|$|This work {{studies the}} content of Security Council Res 1373, its organic and {{procedural}} structure, and later explores the path travelled during {{more than a decade}} of implementation with its main achievements and shortcomings. The singular organic structure established to supervise the implementation of the Resolution offers an interesting testing ground to analyse future trends of global governance to safeguard common universal interests. This contribution concludes with some reflections on the future of <b>counter-terrorist</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the United Nations (UN) and a proposal to create a UN Counter-Terrorist Agency...|$|E
40|$|Both anecdotal and {{empirical}} evidences {{confirm that the}} complex political, ethnic and religious dynamics {{in the region of}} South East Europe (SEE) create the perfect environment for radical groups and individuals affiliated with Al Qaeda and its goals. Supported by their strategic western partners and allies SEE countries have seriously considered threats from modern terrorism. Hence, active involvement in the global counter-terrorist efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq and intelligence cooperation with the coalition partners outside of these theaters clearly speak of the SEE governments' readiness to oppose global terrorists' objectives. However, recent practice shows that different human rights legal tradition and inappropriate political narrative among the coalition partners could pose serious strategic challenges to <b>counter-terrorist</b> intelligence <b>cooperation.</b> Therefore, if not approached appropriately these challenges hold potentials to harm the overall counter-terrorist efforts and turn SEE into a safe-haven for recruitment and radicalization. 	In this context the article first provide evidence to prove that the radical Islam is a serious threat to the region of SEE. Then, through analyses of two case-studies related to Macedonia (the European Court for Human Rights' verdict: "El Masri vs. Macedonia" and "Smilkovci Terrorist attack") examines how legal and strategic (political) considerations challenge intelligence cooperation and affect counterterrorist efforts in SEE. Finally, based on the analyses of the first thesis and the above mentioned cases the article provides some recommendation for the intelligence community in the region of SEE. ...|$|R
