50|$|From Newton, {{force can}} be defined as an {{exertion}} or pressure which can <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> object to accelerate. The concept of force is used to describe <b>an</b> influence which <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> free body (object) to accelerate. It can be a push or <b>a</b> pull, which <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> object to change direction, have new velocity, or to deform temporarily or permanently. Generally speaking, force <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> object's state of motion to change.|$|R
5|$|A solar balloon {{is a black}} balloon that {{is filled}} with {{ordinary}} air. As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is heated and expands <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> upward buoyancy force, much like an artificially heated hot air balloon. Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.|$|E
5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials {{in a way that}} mimics greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|During the season, five storms {{impacted}} land. Hurricane Twelve was the deadliest, leaving eight {{casualties in}} Mazatlán and the costliest was Hurricane Nina, <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> estimated $100,000 in losses. In {{addition to the}} damage, four people were killed by Nina in Hawaii. Hurricane Six killed seven people and Hurricane Ten killed two in Mexico.|$|E
50|$|The anti-RhE {{antibody}} {{is quite}} common especially in the Rh genotype CDe/CDe; It usually only <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> mild hemolytic disease, but can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> severe condition in the newborn. It can occur with other antibodies, usually the anti-Rhc antibody, which can also <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> severe hemolytic disease.|$|R
50|$|The {{reciprocating}} piston/crosshead/main rod/valve {{motion link}} is unbalanced and <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> fore-and-aft surging. Their 90 deg separation <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> swaying couple.|$|R
50|$|Alkalis {{added to}} indium sulfate {{solutions}} precipitate basic salts. For example, potassium hydroxide produces either a basic sulfate, 2 In2O3.SO3•nH2O, or KIn3(OH)6(SO4)2 depending on pH. Sodium pyrophosphate <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> slimy precipitate of indium pyrophosphate, In4(P2O7)3•3H2O. Potassium periodate <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> precipitate of a basic indium periodate, 2 InO5•In(OH)3•6 H2O. Oxalic acid <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> precipitate of indium oxalate, In2(C2O4)3•10 H2O. Alkali oxalates <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> precipitate of the alkali dioxalatoindate to form: MIn(C2O4)2•3 H2O where M=Na, K or NH4.|$|R
5|$|Early on May 18, an {{earthquake}} measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale struck the region, creating a massive landslide—- of rock that released {{pressure on the}} volcano's crater, <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> ejection of steam. Just seconds later, Mount St. Helens erupted laterally, sending supersonic pyroclastic flows into the forest below.|$|E
5|$|In the show's third match, Mark Henry {{defeated}} Big Show. Henry {{gained a}} two-count after a World's Strongest Slam on Big Show. Henry then performed the move again and two running splashes for the pinfall victory. After the match, Henry jumped {{on a chair}} wrapped around Big Show's ankle, <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> injury to Big Show.|$|E
5|$|The {{identification}} of {{bacteria in the}} laboratory is particularly relevant in medicine, where the correct treatment {{is determined by the}} bacterial species <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> infection. Consequently, the need to identify human pathogens was a major impetus for the development of techniques to identify bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The {{highest degree}} of evil deed will <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> soul {{to be born}} into a realm as a denizen of hell, the lower degree of that would <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> soul to be born as an animal, and the lowest degree would <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> soul to be born as a hungry ghost.|$|R
50|$|The sting can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> severe burning {{sensation}} and swelling in humans; in rare cases, it can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> life-threatening reaction (such as anaphylaxis).|$|R
5000|$|Activation of an endocytic pathway: The {{antibody}} activates <b>a</b> pathway which <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> internalization of desmogleïn 1, {{which in}} turn <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> loss of adhesion.|$|R
5|$|The major {{side effect}} of {{warfarin}} use is bleeding. Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). Many drug interactions can increase the effect of warfarin, also <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> overdose.|$|E
5|$|The {{observed}} helium to hydrogen {{ratio in}} Vega is 0.030±0.005, {{which is about}} 40% lower than the Sun. This {{may be caused by}} the disappearance of a helium convection zone near the surface. Energy transfer is instead performed by the radiative process, which may be <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> abundance anomaly through diffusion.|$|E
5|$|As Bode was {{in action}} at Poling, Alfons Orthofer's unit {{attacked}} Ford. There were only six Lewis machine guns manned at Ford and the Ju 87s {{were able to}} attack with complete confidence. Bombs rained down on huts, hangars, building and amongst aircraft drawn up together for maintenance. Early on bombs struck the field's oil tanks and storage compounds <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> enormous blaze which contributed to the crippling damage on the airfield. Gosport also came under attack soon after. Siegel's Ju 87s, with no air opposition, swooped onto their targets causing large-scale damage.|$|E
50|$|Because it <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> loss of {{sympathetic}} tone, {{which plays}} a major role in other forms of shock, neurogenic shock <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> unique and atypical presentation.|$|R
50|$|Gradual {{presentation}} of stimuli <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> increase in familiarity and thus {{an increase in}} associated know responses; however, gradual presentation <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> decrease in remember responses.|$|R
50|$|The {{failure of}} one or more {{reaction}} wheels can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> spacecraft to lose its ability to maintain position and thus potentially <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> mission failure.|$|R
5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Aguilera is chatting {{with a group}} of women. When Aguilera leaves the conversation, a black man {{suddenly}} grabs her buttocks, making Aguilera stop and <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> argument between them. As she continues to sing, the nearby women in the neighborhood join her, while the male residents join the man and form their respective sides in the street. They perform their own hip hop dance skills against each other. At the bridge, Lil' Kim appears in a bikini and a sheer black blouse, and dances in her high heels. The argument ends with Aguilera spraying the men with a water hose, which she holds between her legs and parodies the penis.|$|E
5|$|At school, {{a wealthy}} schoolmate of Kiat Kun's named Tan Beng Soon (Joshua Ang) runs an amateur {{football}} team with his friends. Kiat Kun {{and his friends}} strike a bargain with Beng Soon {{to play on the}} team using the other boys' football shoes, in exchange for helping them cheat on their homework. However, the boys quarrel, <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> angry Beng Soon to renege on the deal and remove Kiat Kun and his friends from the team.|$|E
5|$|BZP {{has been}} shown to have a mixed {{mechanism}} of action, acting on the serotonergic and dopaminergic receptor systems in a similar fashion to MDMA. BZP has amphetamine-like actions on the serotonin reuptake transporter, which increase serotonin concentrations in the extracellular fluids surrounding the cell and thereby increasing activation of the surrounding serotonin receptors. BZP has a lower potency effect on the noradrenaline reuptake transporter and the dopamine reuptake transporter. BZP has a high affinity action at the alpha2-adrenoreceptor, it is an antagonist at the receptor, like yohimbine, which inhibits negative feedback, <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> increase in released noradrenaline.|$|E
40|$|Rats {{and mice}} were given {{antibiotics}} orally and by subcutaneous injection {{and the effects}} on tissue levels of 5 -hydroxytryptamine and intestinal bacteria were studied. In mice {{it was found that}} antibiotics which <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> large reduction in the bacterial flora of the intestine when given orally also <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> significant increase in intestinal 5 -hydroxytryptamine. In rats, neomycin <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> reduction in the urinary excretion of 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid. In both rats and mice, many antibiotics <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> significant reduction in the weight of the spleen...|$|R

50|$|If an {{aircraft}} in flight suffers a disturbance in pitch that <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> increase (or decrease) in angle of attack, {{it is desirable}} that the aerodynamic forces on the aircraft <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> decrease (or increase) in angle of attack so that the disturbance does not <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> continuous increase (or decrease) in angle of attack. This is longitudinal static stability.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} this period, the {{constant}} attempts at reorganisation had proved a mixed bag, particularly for the auxiliary forces. The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and the financial situation of the units was becoming worrying. The system of central per-capita grants helped support the units, despite the worrying side-effect of <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> incentive to keep as many men on the books as possible regardless of fitness, but even so it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to files}} {{recovered}} by Fisher in London (and made public by the president), the American public and Congress both believe that Iran is funding the Blacklist, and The United States and Iran are headed towards war. Looking for more solid proof of Iran's involvement, Fisher infiltrates Quds Force headquarters in Tehran(previously a U.S embassy). Inside, he discovers that Iran {{has nothing to}} do with the Blacklist, and that the files he recovered were planted by The Engineers in order to lure The United States into a war. Fisher narrowly escapes Tehran by using a Predator Drone to blow up the Iranian vehicles chasing him, <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> international incident.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, the {{identification}} of newly discovered genes and new techniques for DNA sequencing led to {{the appearance of a}} distinct field of molecular and genomic laboratory medicine; in 1995, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) was formed to give it structure. In 1999, the AMP co-founded The Journal of Medical Diagnostics. Informa Healthcare launched Expert Reviews in Medical Diagnostics in 2001. From 2002 onwards, the HapMap Project aggregated information on the one-letter genetic differences that recur in the human populationthe single nucleotide polymorphismsand their relationship with disease. In 2012, molecular diagnostic techniques for Thalassemia use genetic hybridization tests to identify the specific single nucleotide polymorphism <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> individual's disease.|$|E
5|$|On 16 June 2011, <b>a</b> welding {{accident}} <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> fire at Hallingskeid Station, {{causing the}} complete {{destruction of the}} platform. This <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> seven days long closure of the line.|$|R

40|$|Results of {{perfusion}} {{of excess}} Ca++ and Na+ into the hypothalamus of the hibernating ground squirrel Citellus beechyi are presented. The significant {{finding is that}} perfused excess Ca++ <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> reduction in core temperature when ambient temperature is low (12 C). Ca++ also <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> rise in rectal temperature at high ambient temperature (33 C). Thus hypothalamic Ca++ perfusion apparently <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> nonspecific depression of thermoregulatory control...|$|R
