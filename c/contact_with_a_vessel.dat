50|$|The game {{begins with}} the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) in orbit around a red giant star {{near the edge of}} the Neutral Zone (the star {{adversely}} affects Romulan sensors, rendering the Enterprise undetectable). They are monitoring the border in response to increased Romulan activity; the Romulans recently lost <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> patrolling the Neutral Zone. Starfleet had agreed to assist in any investigation attempt as a sign of goodwill. The Romulans refuse the aid, and prefer to handle things on their own, which naturally prompts Starfleet to increase border patrols.|$|E
50|$|The mine {{fields were}} {{composed}} of both contact mines, similar to conventional naval mines exploded by <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel,</b> and controlled mines {{such as the}} M4 Ground Mine with a 3,000 pound TNT charge. Those mines were planted in planned groups at predetermined locations, connected to shore by electrical cables for firing when a target was observed within their effective range. The mines could be fired individually or as a group. The Distribution Box Boats were specially equipped to maintain the distribution boxes that joined the individual mines within a mine group to the main cable connecting the group to the mine casemate.|$|E
50|$|After {{some days}} of poor weather, Halibut entered the {{approaches}} to the Tsugaru Strait. Firing on a freighter found by radar in foggy conditions, she expended six torpedoes with no results. Returning to the coast between Erimo Saki and Muroran, she closed on a radar contact around dawn on 6 September. The contact, the heavily loaded freighter Shogen Maru (3362 tons), was sighted and sunk with four torpedoes. That night Halibut made radar <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> identified as a destroyer (later {{found to be the}} light cruiser) Nachi, firing the submarine's remaining aft torpedoes in a rough sea for no hits. (One torpedo actually hit but was a dud.) With only one torpedo remaining, she began her return trip to Midway 7 September after eleven days in enemy waters. That night she traced radio transmissions to a small sampan she sank with her deck guns. Halibut stopped briefly at Midway for fuel and food before sailing to a full refit at Pearl Harbor, arriving on 16 September.|$|E
50|$|Ice {{can also}} be formed by {{seawater}} spray and water vapour freezing upon <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel's</b> superstructure when temperature is low enough. Ice formed in this manner is known as rime. As the formation progress, the aboveboard weight of the vessel increases and may ultimately cause capsizing. Furthermore, rime ice may impede the correct functioning of important navigational instruments on board, such as radar or radio installations. Different strategies {{for the removal of}} such ice are employed: chipping away the ice or even using fire hoses in an attempt to remove the ice.|$|R

40|$|The North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, one of {{the most}} {{critically}} endangered whales in the world, is subject to high anthropogenic mortality. Vessel-whale collisions and entanglement in fishing gear were indicated in 27 (67. 5 %) of the 40 right whales necropsied between 1970 and December 2006. Of those, at least 9 deaths (22. 5 %) resulted from blunt <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel.</b> To reduce the likelihood of fatal collisions, speed restrictions are being considered for vessels traversing critical habitat, although the effects of speed on collision outcomes have not been specifically evaluated from a biomechanics perspective. The ultimate goal of a larger collaborative project is to evaluate the efficacy of speed restrictions for reducing blunt collision mortality using a multi-scale finite element model. Complete, transverse fracture of the right whale mandible, an injury seen only in right whales killed by vessels, is used as a proxy for mortality in the model. Vital for that model are the material properties and biomechanical behavior of the right whale mandible. Here, the internal structure and physical properties of right whale jawbone tissue are reported. The average apparent densities, 0. 4258 g/cc ± 0. 0970 and 1. 2370 g/cc ± 0. 0535 for trabecular and cortical bone respectively, indicate that the bone is of relatively low density. Average ash content for trabecular bone (64. 38 % ± 1. 1330) is comparable with values from other species, indicating that low density results from a reduction of bone mass, not mineralization. Mechanical properties of right whale bone (Young's modulus of elasticity and Poisson's ratio) were determined via uniaxial compression testing. (cont.) These data are incorporated into the finite element model simulating different loading conditions (e. g. vessel speeds) that likely lead to mandibular failure and thereby mortality from blunt vessel collisions. Model results (e. g. risk of fracture) are used to determine the effect of speed restrictions on collision outcomes. by Regina Campbell-Malone. Thesis (Ph. D.)

5000|$|Imminent {{collision}} alert: It may be warranted to urgently {{attempt to}} make radio <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> approaching <b>vessel</b> that is running into danger or approaching a dangerous close quarters situation and therefore at risk of colliding with one's own vessel, and warning the operator to keep clear.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Combining bevacizumab with platinum-based {{chemotherapy}} significantly improves {{survival for}} patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the proportion of patients who could receive this combined therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective single centre analysis of patients treated between 2007 and 2008. Exclusion criteria for bevacizumab included: squamous cell carcinoma, contraindication to platinum-based chemotherapy, uncontrolled hypertension, haemoptysis superior to 2. 5 mL, recent surgery, and/or tomodensitometric criteria after independent review by two radiologists (<b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> proximal <b>vessel,</b> tracheobronchial involvement, cavitation). Cardiovascular diseases and central tumour location were not systematically considered as contraindications. RESULTS: Among 194 patients analysed, 21 (10. 8 %) to 35 (18 %) patients were eligible for bevacizumab, whether or not cardiovascular diseases and central tumour location were considered as contraindications. The kappa coefficient was 0. 49. CONCLUSION: Even though the proportion of patients who can receive chemotherapy plus bevacizumab may vary according to the eligibility criteria chosen and the interpretation of the CT scan, it is unlikely to exceed 25 % of patients in daily practice...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the first multi-objective and multi-disciplinary coronary stent design optimization study of its kind. Coronary stents are tubular, often mesh-. like, structures which are deployed in diseased (stenosed) artery segments {{to provide a}} scaffolding feature that keeps the arteries open (after the treatment of coronary artery disease). A novel three variable geometry parameterisation of a CYPHER (Cordis corp., Johnson & Johnson co.) type stent is proposed to explore the functionality of a sequence of circumferential rings connected by ‘n’ shaped links. The performance of each design is measured by six figures of merit (objectives/metrics) representing (i) acute recoil, (ii) tissue stresses, (iii) haemodynamic disturbance, (iv) drug delivery, (v) uniformity of drug distribution, and (vi) flexibility. These metrics are obtained from computational simulations of (i) structural deformation through balloon inflated expansion of <b>a</b> stent into <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stenosed <b>vessel,</b> (ii) pulsatile flow over the deformed stent embedded in the vessel wall, (iii) steady-state drug distribution into the tissue, and (iv) flexibility of a stent {{in response to an}} applied moment. Design improvement is obtained by a multi-objective surrogate modelling approach using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to search for an optimal family of designs. A number of trade-offs between the different objectives are identified. In particular a conflict between pairs of the following objectives are shown – (a) volume average stress vs recoil, (b) volume average drug vs. volume average stress, (c) flexibility vs volume average stress, (d) flexibility vs. haemodynamic disturbance, (e) volume average drug vs. haemodynamic disturbance, and (f) uniformity of drug vs. volume average stress. Different paradigms to choose the optimal designs from the obtained Pareto fronts are presented and under each such paradigm, the optimal designs and there relative positions <b>with</b> respect to <b>a</b> representative CYPHER stent are show...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} their presumed {{relevance}} in maintaining interalveolar septal fluid homeostasis, {{the knowledge of the}} anatomy of human lung lymphatics is still incomplete. The recent discovery of reliable markers specific for lymphatic endothelium has led to the observation that, contrary to previous assumptions, human lymphatic vessels extend deep inside the pulmonary lobule in association with bronchioles, intralobular arterioles or small pulmonary veins. The aim {{of this study was to}} provide a morphometric characterization of lymphatic vessels in the periphery of the human lung. Human lung sections were immunolabelled with the lymphatic marker D 2 - 40, followed by blood vessel staining with von Willebrand Factor. Lymphatic vessels were classified into: intralobular (including those associated with bronchovascular bundles, perivascular, peribronchiolar and interalveolar), pleural (in the connective tissue of the visceral pleura), and interlobular (in interlobular septa). The percentage area occupied by the lymphatic lumen was much greater in the interlobular septa and in the subpleural space than in the lobule. Most of the intralobular lymphatic vessels were in close <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> blood <b>vessel,</b> either alone or within a bronchovascular bundle, whereas 7 % were associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bronchiole and < 1 % were not connected to blood vessels or bronchioles (interalveolar). Intralobular lymphatic size progressively decreased from bronchovascular through to peribronchiolar, perivascular and interalveolar lymphatics. Lymphatics associated with bronchovascular bundles had similar morphometric characteristics to pleural and interlobular lymphatics. Shape factors were similar across lymphatic populations, except that peribronchiolar lymphatics had a marginally increased roundness and circularity, suggesting a more regular shape due to increased filling, and interlobular lymphatics had greater elongation, due to a greater proportion of conducting lymphatics cut longitudinally. Unsupervised cluster analysis confirmed a marked heterogeneity of lymphatic vessels both within and between groups, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cluster of smaller vessels specifically represented in perivascular and interalveolar lymphatics within the alveolar interstitium. Our data indicate that intralobular lymphatics are a heterogeneous population, including vessels surrounding the bronchovascular bundle analogous to the conducting vessels present in the pleural and interlobular septa, many small perivascular lymphatics responsible for maintaining fluid balance in the alveolar interstitium, and a minority of intermediate lymphatics draining the peripheral airways. These lymphatic populations could be differentially involved in the pathogenesis of diseases preferentially involving distinct lung compartments...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To analyze {{feasibility}} {{and outcomes}} of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) for endophytic hilar tumors in low-intermediate (ASA I- 11) risk patients. Methods: This {{is a single}} centre retrospective study. From May 2009 to September 2011, 208 LPNs were performed at our institution. Overall 11 (5. 2 %) elective LPNs were for hilar tumors not visible on kidney surface. Hilar tumor {{was defined as a}} mass located in the renal hilum and in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> major renal <b>vessel</b> on preoperative imaging. Procedures were carried out by a single experienced surgeon (G. G.) via retroperitoneal approach by clamping the only main renal artery. Results: Mean (range) age of patients was 45. 3 years (38. 2 - 64. 1), tumor size 1. 6 cm (1. 2 - 2. 0), warm ischemia time 24 min (19 - 32), operative time 140 min (110 - 200) and estimated blood loss 270 ml (100 - 750). Two collecting system injuries were observed and repaired intraoperatively. No conversion to open surgery was required. Final pathological examination revealed 10 renal cell carcinomas and 1 Oncocytoma. A negative surgical margin was obtained in 10 / 11 (91 %) patients. Renal function and serum hemoglobin were nearly unaltered pre and post-surgery. No tumor recurrence was observed at mean (range) follow-up of 34 months (15 - 43). Conclusions: In experienced hands, LPN represents a feasible, safe and effective treatment for selected patients diagnosed with endophytic hilar masses. A larger number of patients and longer follow-up are required to draw definitive conclusions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The {{following}} day, the task force was attacked by a group of six enemy dive bombers. St. Louis was hit and suffered the loss of 23 men. Several snoopers later approached the task force and were taken under fire, Woodworths guns accounted for one while she and her sister ships sustained no casualties or damage. On 14 and 15 February, Woodworth, with Farenholt, Buchanan, Lansdowne, and , conducted an antishipping sweep of St. George's Channel north of Rabaul, New Britain, but encountered no Japanese vessels. On 17 and 18 February, the same destroyers bombarded Rabaul and shore batteries on Praed Point. Woodworth fired torpedoes at two ships leaving Simpson Harbor and later at large groups of ships in Kervia Bay. She also fired her guns at targets near Timber Point and Cape Gazelle. On 24 February, while conducting an antishipping sweep along Truk-Kavieng, New Ireland, shipping lanes about 60 miles northwest of Kavieng, she made radar <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Japanese merchant <b>vessel</b> and <b>a</b> large, heavily laden tanker. Woodworth fired 38 rounds of 5-inch/38-caliber at the merchant vessel which was closed and sunk by DesDiv 24. Woodworth fishtailed at various times to avoid shells from the shore batteries. Two enemy ships were sunk in the harbor, and one other was damaged and left burning. The American warship also set numerous barges afire in Steffen Strait and engaged Japanese shore batteries. Woodworth arrived at Port Purvis, Florida Island, on 26 February.|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{describe}} {{health care}} utilization (HCU) and predict analgesic use and health professional (HP) contact at baseline and 2 years in individuals with early symptomatic hip and/or knee osteoarthritis (OA). DesignBaseline and two-year data on HCU of the 1002 participants from the multi-centre Cohort Hip & Cohort Knee study were used. Six forms {{of health care}} services were described: analgesic use, supplement use, <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> General Practitioner (GP), <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> HP, <b>contact</b> in secondary care, and alternative medicine use. Multivariable logistic regression was performed {{in order to identify}} predisposing, enabling and disease-related variables that predict analgesic use and HP contact at 2 years; treatment modalities of first choice in early OA. ResultsFor the hip (n= 170), the knee (n= 414) and the hip and knee (n= 418) group analgesic use (38 %, 29 % and 47 %, respectively), <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> GP (32 %, 38 % and 36 %, respectively) and <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> HP (26 %, 18 % and 20 %, respectively), were reported most often at baseline. <b>Contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> GP significantly decreased, supplement use increased (to about one third), and other treatment modalities remained stable at 2 years. In all three groups, analgesic use at baseline was the strongest predictor for analgesic use at 2 years, whereas <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> HP at baseline was the strongest predictor of <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> HP after 2 years. Belonging to a first generation minority was a predisposing risk factor [Odds Ratio (95 %-CI), 8. 72 (1. 55 – 48. 97) ] for analgesic use in the hip and knee group. ConclusionsIn early OA, familiarity with HCU and other predisposing factors are, apart from disease-related factors strongly associated with HCU at 2 years. Further research is necessary to examine whether our findings reflect sub-optimal management of early OA in terms of efficacy and equity...|$|R
