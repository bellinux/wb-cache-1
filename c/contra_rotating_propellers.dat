40|$|A concept {{study for}} an {{environmentally}} friendly aircraft {{is made with}} the help of mathematical models. The aircraft has a capacity of 4 passengers and is powered by electrical engines and lithium-air batteries so that no greenhouse gases are emitted. The aim of the study is to find a concept that can compete with today’s petrol powered aircraft, with applications in entertainment flying and transportation. Flight conditions such as steady state flight and steady climbing are modeled to estimate the performance of the aircraft and to find {{the most efficient way to}} fly. A static stability analysis is made to determine a geometry for which the aircraft is statically stable in pitch. The study shows that a canard configuration together with pusher <b>contra</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>propellers</b> is a good way to design a very efficient aircraft. It is also found out that the most energy efficient way to climb is to use a high rate of climb and a low velocity and that it can be profitable to increase the weight of the aircraft with more batteries...|$|E
2500|$|A report {{released}} by the investigation team in mid-March, by Ukrainian [...] "Aviation and Time" [...] magazine, provided preliminary details into the cause. According to the report, immediately after take-off one of the engines was automatically shut off by its electronic safeguards after it exceeded the safe RPM limit. The front set of blades of the <b>contra</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>propeller</b> assembly stopped but the aft [...] part of the propeller assembly continued turning due to the damaged oil line that powered the blade actuators. This caused the negative air flow estimated at 5,000kg/11,023lbs. of thrust.|$|R

In the B-88, an engine plant {{was based on the}} Armstrong Siddeley Mamba gas turbine, the Double Mamba - also known as the [...] "Twin Mamba" [...] - driving two four-blade contra-rotating propellers through a common gearbox.

40|$|Abstract- The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} design, development and analysis of propeller by using a bamboo composite fibre material with <b>contra</b> <b>rotating</b> advance airboat <b>propellers,</b> airboat propeller shows characteristics of its non-aviation usage. The design of a propeller is broad, flattened blade and squared-off tips because the aerodynamic favors a high drag that is useful for slowing an airboat. A simple method of predicting the performance of a propeller is the use of Blade Element Theory. In this method the propeller is divided into a number of independent sections along the length. At each section a force balance is applied involving 2 D section lift and drag with the thrust and torque produced by the section. At the same time a balance of axial and angular momentum is applied. This produces a set of nonlinear equations that can be solved by iteration for each blade section. The resulting values of section thrust and torque can be summed to predict the overall performance of the propeller...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} three {{different}} ways to represent a counter <b>rotating</b> <b>propeller</b> are evaluated. One where a map for a single <b>rotating</b> <b>propeller</b> is used, one {{where most of the}} swirl losses are excluded from the original map, and one where swirl losses are excluded and the position of the maximum efficiency is determined by the design disc loading. The two methods using the reduced swirl maps generate similar trends with similar size propellers for the optimal design and similar fuel burn figures. If the original single rotating map is used to represent counter <b>rotating</b> <b>propellers</b> the trends are significantly changed and are viewed to be unphysical. The optimal size propeller is then closer to 4. 5 m rather than 3. 5 meters. With the maps where a reduction in swirl losses are accounted for, the trends show a slightly decreasing fuel consumption with decreasing tip speed. If the single <b>rotating</b> <b>propeller</b> map is used there is an opposite trend and it is of higher magnitude...|$|R

40|$|For next {{generation}} aircraft, <b>contra</b> <b>rotating</b> open rotor propulsion systems are currently discussed. Their economic advantages are {{in conflict with}} their high noise emission, which concentrates in distinct frequency bands. To bring <b>contra</b> <b>rotating</b> open rotor engines into operation at commercial aircraft and to maintain the passenger comfort level, active systems for noise reduction are consi-dered. In this article, a <b>contra</b> <b>rotating</b> open rotor noise simulator for the future testing of active systems is presented. The simulator consists of a 14 x 8 loudspeaker array, which is placed close to a test fuselage. Driving each loudspeaker by a particular signal, complex sound pressure fields can be synthesized on the fuselage. The algorithm presented here calculates loudspeaker signals to synthesize the target sound pressure spectra on the fuselage. These target spectra were derived from numerical <b>contra</b> <b>rotating</b> open rotor engine simulations, coupled with a Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings solver to propagate the calculated sound pressure field toward virtual surface micropho-ne positions on the test fuselage. Requirement for such synthesis is {{the knowledge of the}} transfer paths from all loudspeakers to all surface microphones. In experiments, these paths are measured, and the loudspeaker signals are synthesized by the algorithm. Finally, measurements with the loudspeaker array and a microphone array are shown which prove the concep...|$|R
