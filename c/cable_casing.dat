40|$|Linear alkylbenzenes (LAB) are {{commonly}} found in the environment due to their use as a precursor {{in the manufacture of}} linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LAS) detergents, in which they remain as trace contaminants. Other uses include insulating oils in buried electricity transmission cables, from where they may enter soil and groundwater in the event of damage to the <b>cable</b> <b>casing</b> or joints. They are readily biodegraded under aerobic conditions but may be released into anoxic environments where they can persist for some time. Laboratory experiments show that LAB can be degraded under nitrate-reducing conditions, and isomeric analysis of the remaining LAB is good indicator of the degree of degradation. Work is continuing to identify changes in microbial diversity using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. ...|$|E
40|$|Usage of the Internet {{is growing}} at a rapid pace. This growing {{popularity}} has {{had an impact on}} the content available over the Internet. Today, many bandwidth hungry applications are available to end users: music files, streaming audi 0 jvideo, and video conferencing. To be of practical use, larger bandwidth applications require higher speed Internet connections to the consumer. One method of providing high speed Internet access to a home or small business is through twisted pair telephone cables. Use of twisted pair to provide high speed Internet service is not without its problems. Many loop impairments exist that hinder high speed service, or prevent it altogether. Purposely placed impairments include loading coils and bridged taps. Unintentional impairments include wire splices and water in the <b>cable</b> <b>casings.</b> The locations of these impairments help the telephone companies (telco's) determine which lines have potential problems in delivering Internet access. A new technique called frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) has been proposed to locate these loop impairments. This thesis focuses on proving the viability of using FDR to accurately detect loop impairments. A physical device was designed and constructed to use the FDR technique. The device was tested on various telephone loop configurations. The device was also compared with a commercially available product. The results of the testing indicate FDR is a viable alternative fqr locating loop impairments. It performs at least as well as commercially available products...|$|R
50|$|A new {{technique}} in well-monitoring involves fiber-optic <b>cables</b> outside the <b>casing.</b> Using the fiber optics, temperatures {{can be measured}} every foot along the well - even while the wells are being fracked and pumped. By monitoring {{the temperature of the}} well, engineers can determine how much fracking fluid different parts of the well use as well as how much natural gas or oil they collect, during hydraulic fracturing operation and when the well is producing.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports the}} well design, {{drilling}} and completion operation {{as well as}} the coring technique applied in the CO 2 SINK project. Three boreholes, one injection well and two observation wells have been drilled to a total depth of about 800  m. 200  m of recovered 6 ” core material has been real-time analysed in a research field lab. The wells have been completed as “smart” wells, containing a variety of permanently installed down-hole sensors for the continuous monitoring of the CO 2 in the reservoir. All wells were cased with stainless final casings equipped with pre-perforated sand filters in the reservoir zone and wired on the outside with fiber-optical and multi-conductor copper <b>cables.</b> The reservoir <b>casing</b> section is externally coated with a fiber-glass-resin wrap for electrical insulation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{gearshift}} command {{system is}} composed of a cable encapsulated in a <b>casing.</b> The <b>cable</b> transfers {{the motion of the}} gearshift lever to the gearbox selector lever. The work presented focuses on the cable-casing system and its non linear behavior. A first step of the analysis consists in calculating the cable-casing path starting from the boundary conditions given by the positions and slopes at the extremities and the passing points. A non linear co-rotational finite element formulation is used in order to model correctly the large displacements involved. The cable-casing contact problem is solved using the penalty method. Contact points between the <b>cable</b> and the <b>casing</b> are computed. The stiffness matrix computed from the spatially curved cable-casing within the contact points is then the starting point for {{the second part of the}} analysis. It concerns the dynamic behavior simulation of the cable-casing under harmonic excitations. The computation uses the Newmark time integration scheme and the dynamic time responses are calculated around static equilibrium positions previously determined. Comparisons between simulation and experiment are presented...|$|R
40|$|E-waste is {{referred}} to obsolete, broken electronic devices such as mobile phones, televisions, computer monitors, laptops, printers, scanners, and associated wiring (Luther, 2010). E-waste is generated in large quantities (Tang et al., 2010); {{the composition of the}} waste creates a major problem. E-waste contains more than 1000 different substances, many of which are toxic metals and organic pollutants (Robinson, 2009). These include lead and cadmium in circuit boards; lead oxide and cadmium in monitor cathode ray tubes (CRTs); mercury in switches and flat screen monitors; cadmium in computer batteries; polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in older capacitors and transformers; and brominated flame retardants on printed circuit boards, plastic <b>casings,</b> <b>cables</b> and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cable insulation that release highly toxic dioxins and furans when burned to retrieve copper from the wires (BAN, 2002). Also, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are used as brominated flame retardants in electronic circuit boards (Wang et al., 2005). Activities carried out in the site of interest include dismantling of the different electronic waste, sorting out of various parts and burning of wires and other parts to get valuable metals. The complex composition of e-waste may pose a threat to the environment and human health if they are not disposed correctly...|$|R
40|$|Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) have {{in recent}} years {{increased}} in number and become more common. New field of applications in previously unexplored areas emerges {{at the same time}} as the UAS technology constantly evolves. In the construction industry and especially in civil engineering applications which this study covers with, the UAS photogrammetry is quite an unexplored technology and despite its ability to quickly measure and estimate various properties on a construction site. Since follow-up of cost estimates and production plans is fundamental for the success of a construction project, the purpose of the study has been to evaluate to how unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can be used to monitor the production progress of civil engineering works. The result is based on a field study in which a UAV from the manufacturer 3 D Robotics is used. The author made a reconstruction of camera equipment to adapt the UAV for UAS Aerial Photogrammetry. The reconstruction included camera, tripod, <b>cables,</b> protective <b>casing</b> and memory cards for programming the camera. To evaluate the accuracy of the UAS photogrammetry, the measurement was compared with total station measurements and terrestrial laser scanning. All measurements have been performed on hard flat and hilly surfaces. Flat single points from the UAS photogrammetry RMS measurements were compared with laser scanning using RMS (Root Mean Square) values. As reference for the measurements values from the total station were used. Accuracy in height of 9 mm was obtained which is the same precision as the laser scanning delivered in the same study. For larger contiguous areas, terrain models from laser scanning and UAS photogrammetry were compared, one flat surface area and two hilly surface areas. A mean deviation of 9 mm was obtained for the flat area while the deviation ranged between 14 - 30 mm for the hilly areas. UAS photogrammetry assessed was 4 - 8 times as efficient as the conventional methods used in study. There are also disadvantages to use the UAS technology since it is weather dependent and the software used for data processing is still under development.
