5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela is {{a member}} of the genus Myzomela which includes two other Australian species, the scarlet myzomela of eastern Australia, and the dusky myzomela of northern Australia. It belongs to the honeyeater family Meliphagidae. A 2004 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of honeyeaters found it to be the next closest relative to a smaller group consisting of the scarlet and cardinal myzomelas, although only five of the thirty members of the genus Myzomela were analysed. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA suggests that the ancestor of the red-headed myzomela diverged from that of the black-breasted myzomela around 4 million years ago, however the relationships of many species within the genus is uncertain. Molecular analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea. Because the red-headed myzomela occurs on many offshore islands and appears to be an effective water-crosser, it has been hypothesised that north-western Australia was the primary <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the two subspecies.|$|E

They grow as forbs, vines, sub-shrubs, shrubs, and small trees, and often have attractive fruit and flowers (Khan. R., 1979). In India, the genus is represented by 45 species out of which several species are cultivated including S. lycopersicum (Tomato), S. tuberosum (Potato) and S. melongena (Brinjal). <b>Centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> cultivated plants are identified {{on the basis of}} the number and diversity of wild species as well as the number of endemic species of the concerned genus in a given region, while the <b>Centres</b> <b>of</b> Diversity are recognized {{on the basis of the}} number and diversity of different varieties, wild and cultivated, of the species. The <b>Centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> and <b>Centres</b> <b>of</b> Diversity of crop plants as known to us are largely based on circumstantial evidence.
