25|$|Once we {{have found}} the {{augmented}} shortest path, {{we want to make}} sure we ignore any other paths that are longer than this shortest paths. BFS algorithm marks nodes in path with distance with source being 0. Thus, after doing BFS, we can start at each unmatched vertex in U, follow the path by following nodes with distance that increments by 1. When we finally arrive at the destination vDummy, if its distance is 1 more than last node in V then we know that the path we followed is (one of the possibly many) shortest path. In that case we <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> update the pairing for vertices on path in U and V. Note that each vertex in V on path, except for the last one, is non-free vertex. So updating pairing for these vertices in V to different vertices in U is equivalent to removing previously matched edge and adding new unmatched edge in matching. This is same as doing the symmetric difference (i.e. remove edges common to previous matching and add non-common edges in augmented path in new matching).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Statistical machine {{learning}} has revolutionized computer vision. Sys-tems trained on {{large quantities of}} empirical data can achieve levels of robustness that far exceed their hand-crafted competitors. But this robustness is in a sense "shallow " since a shift in context to a situation not explored in the training data can completely destroy it. This is not an intrinsic feature of the {{machine learning}} approach, but rather of the rigid separation of the powerfully adaptive training phase from the final cast-in-stone system. An alternative this work explores is to build "deep " systems that contain not only the trained-up perceptual modules, but the tools used to train them, and the resources necessary to acquire appropriate training data. Thus, if a situation occurs that was not explored in training, the system <b>can</b> <b>go</b> right <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> explore it. This is exemplified through an object recognition system that is tightly coupled with an "active segmentation " behavior that can discover the boundaries of objects by making them move. ...|$|R

50|$|North Carolina {{took the}} lead in signing {{highways}} as I-73 following AASHTO's approval in 1997 and since has approved construction projects to build new sections of the Interstate Highway. I-73 is essentially complete from Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro to just south of Ellerbe. Two new sections of what will be I-73 are being completed, the section from the US-220/NC-68 junction to Piedmont Triad International Airport and the section south of Ellerbe to the junction with US-74 west of Rockingham. I-74 runs concurrent with I-73 from north of Ashboro to Rockingham, whence it will follow US-74 to Wilmington. The only other progress in building I-73 can be seen in Virginia and South Carolina. In 2005 Virginia completed an environmental impact statement for its recommended route for I-73 from I-81 in Roanoke to the North Carolina border. The Federal Highway Administration approved the EIS report in April 2007. Virginia <b>can</b> now <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> draw up plans to construct the highway and proceed to build it once funds are obtained. South Carolina also has shown recent interest in building its section of I-73 with a corridor selected for the route from I-95 to Myrtle Beach in 2006 and a final decision on how the highway should be routed north of I-95 to the NC border in July 2007. In January 2006 the South Carolina state legislature introduced bills to construct I-73 as a toll highway. It is hoped a guaranteed stream of revenue will allow it to build its section of I-73 within 10 years. The FHWA approved South Carolina's proposal on August 10, 2007.|$|R

It soon became clear that First National officials. It was determined that total expenses, including the $2.5 million already paid to Woodmen of the World and adjoining property owners for land, would come to $13.9 million. Next, it became necessary to form a holding company because there is a statutory limitation on the amount of money a bank is allowed to invest in brick and mortar. The U.S. Code draws the line at 50 percent of the financial institution's capital and surplus account, and they had decided to invest as much in that building, literally, as First National's entire net worth.A parent corporation, acting technically in its own name and on its own behalf, <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> incur a sizable debt for construction purposes without running afoul of federal law, as long as it owns at least 80 percent of its subsidiary's stock.
