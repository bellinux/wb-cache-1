40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the safety of treatment with vibration massage using a deep oscillation device and the effects on symptom severity and quality of life in patients with primary fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Outpatients with FMS performed an observational prospective study with visits 2 – 4 weeks after the last treatment (control) and after further 2 months (follow-up). Patients were treated with 10 sessions of 45 [*]min deep oscillation massage, 2 /week. Primary outcome parameters were safety and tolerability (5 -level Likert scale (1 = very good)) (after each treatment session and at <b>control</b> <b>visit).</b> Secondary outcome parameters were symptom severity (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), pain) and quality of life (SF- 36).

40|$|Introduction & Objectives To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} preoperative biofeedback combined with an assisted low-intensity regimen of postoperative pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) in reducing the incidence, duration and severity of urinary incontinence in patients undergoing open radical prostatectomy (RP). Material & Methods Design: Single-center, randomized control trial. The intervention group received the day before RP a training session with biofeedback, supervised oral and written instructions on Kegel exercises and a structured program of postoperative PFMT; patients underwent <b>control</b> <b>visits,</b> including a session of biofeedback, at monthly intervals only. As standard of care, the control group received, after catheter removal, only oral and written instructions on Kegel exercises to be performed at home and underwent <b>control</b> <b>visits</b> at 1, 3 and 6 months follow-up. At each visit the number of incontinence episodes and of diapers per week and patient-reported outcome measures (ICIQ-UI, OAB-ICIQ, UCLA-PCI, IPSS-QoL) were assessed in both groups. All participants were followed-up {{for a period of}} at least six months after catheter removal. The primary outcome was the recovery of continence strictly defined as a ICIQ-UI score of zero. The differences between groups were analyzed using Fisher test and non-parametric statistics and significance threshold was set at p< 0. 05. The software used was GraphPad Prism 5 for Windows.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma has {{extensively}} {{been proved}} {{to have an}} excellent prognosis. The results of autopsy series and mass-screening studies suggest that {{a significant percentage of}} population have this disease, but its behaviour is mostly indolent. However, when an incidental microcarcinoma is diagnosed, aggressive surgical treatment is the current recommendation. Two hospitals in Japan started treating these patients with active surveillance, following them with periodic <b>control</b> <b>visits</b> and only recommending surgery after demonstrated disease progression. Even though the results with this conservative strategy are promising, there is no study that specifically compares both managements. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this study is to}} determine whether active surveillance is an appropriate alternative to initial surgery in the management of patients with papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid with good prognostic factors. METHODS: This will be a longitudinal, prospective, non-randomized, controlled trial. It will be set in the CeCAT consortium hospitals, with the Hospital Universitari Josep Trueta as the reference center. The participants will be 191 patients diagnosed with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma in the CeCAT centers, using a consecutive non-probabilistic sequential sampling. The patients will be separated in 2 groups, according to the treatment decision, in “active surveillance group” and “initial surgery group”, and then followed with periodic <b>control</b> <b>visits</b> during 10 years. Progression of the disease will be the dependent variable, and will be measured using ultrasonographic criteria. Progression will be defined either by the appearance of cervical lymph nodes, the enlargement of the primary microcarcinoma or the reappearance of lesions in the thyroid bed. Percentages, means +/- standard deviation, χ² test and logistic regression will be performed to analyze and describe the results of the stud...|$|E

RESEARCH DESIGN ANDMETHODSdTwelve adolescents with type 1 diabetes (five males; mean age 15. 0 [SD 1. 4] years; HbA 1 c 7. 9 [0. 7]%; BMI 21. 4 [2. 6] kg/m 2) were studied at a clinical research facility on two occasions and received, in random order, either closed-loop basal insulin delivery or conventional pump therapy for 36 h. During closed-loop insulin delivery, pump basal rates were adjusted every 15 min according to a model predictive control algorithm informed by subcutaneous sensor glucose levels. During <b>control</b> <b>visits,</b> subjects ’ standard in-fusion rates were applied. Prandial insulin boluses were given before main meals (50 – 80 g carbohydrates) but not before snacks (15 – 30 g carbohydrates). Subjects undertook moderate-intensity exercise, not announced to the algorithm, on a stationary bicycle at a 140 bpm heart rate in the morning (40 min) and afternoon (20 min). Primary outcome was time when plasma glucose was in the target range (71 – 180 mg/dL). RESULTSdClosed-loop basal insulin delivery increased percentage time when glucose was in the target range (median 84 % [interquartile range 78 – 88 %] vs. 49 % [26 – 79 %], P = 0. 02) and reduced mean plasma glucose levels (128 [19] vs. 165 [55] mg/dL, P = 0. 02). Plasma glucose levels were in the target range 100 % of the time on 17 of 24 nights during closed-loop insulin delivery. Hypoglycemia occurred on 10 occasions during <b>control</b> <b>visits</b> and 9 occasions during closed-loop delivery (5 episodes were exercise related, and 4 occurred within 2. 5 h of prandial bolus).
