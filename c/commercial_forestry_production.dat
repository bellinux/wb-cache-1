40|$|Gaps in {{research}} exist for country-wide analyses to identify areas {{of particular importance}} for biodiversity and ecosystem services to help reach Aichi Target 11 in developing countries. Here we provide a spatial conservation prioritization approach that ranks landowners for maximizing the representation of biodiversity features and ecosystem services, while exploring the trade-offs with agricultural and <b>commercial</b> <b>forestry</b> <b>production</b> and land cost, using Uruguay as a case study. Specifically, we explored four policy scenarios, ranging from a business as usual scenario where only biodiversity and ecosystem services {{were included in the}} analysis to a potentially unsustainable scenario where expansion of alternative land uses and economic development would be given higher priority over biodiversity and ecosystem services. At the 17 % land target proposed for conservation, the representation levels for biodiversity and ecosystem services were, on average, higher under the business as usual scenario. However, a small addition to the proposed target (from 17 to 20 %) allowed to meet same representation levels for biodiversity and ecosystem services, while decreasing conflict with agricultural and <b>commercial</b> <b>forestry</b> <b>production</b> and opportunity costs to local landowners. Under the unsustainable scenario, a striking 41 % addition to the conservation target (from 17 to 58 %) was needed to meet same representation levels for threatened ecosystems and ecosystem services, which are crucial to sustain human well-being. Our results highlight that more realistic and potentially higher conservation targets, than politically set targets, can be achieved at the country level when sustainable development needs are also accounted for.

40|$|Based on an {{extended}} economic model and space econometrics, this essay analyzed the spatial distributions and interdependent relationships of the <b>production</b> of <b>forestry</b> in China; also the input-output elasticity of <b>forestry</b> <b>production</b> were calculated. Results figure out there exists significant spatial correlation in <b>forestry</b> <b>production</b> in China. Spatial distribution is mainly manifested as spatial agglomeration. The output elasticity of labor force {{is equal to}} 0. 6649, and that of capital is equal to 0. 8412. The contribution of land is significantly negative. Labor and capital are the main determinants for the province-level <b>forestry</b> <b>production</b> in China. Thus, research on the province-level <b>forestry</b> <b>production</b> should not ignore the spatial effect.

40|$|The trade {{relationship}} between small-scale growers and processing companies often {{plays an important}} role in determining the nature and extent of benefi ts derived from <b>commercial</b> <b>forestry,</b> and the distribution of these benefi ts.   Many strategies are used by individual small-scale growers, village communities, companies and government agencies to form partnerships to undertake <b>commercial</b> <b>forestry</b> – including out-grower schemes, land leasing by companies, and using intermediary brokers between small-scale growers and processors. This article reports on the key fi ndings of a three-year research project that explored different business partnerships used in <b>commercial</b> <b>forestry</b> in Australia and Indonesia, and identifi ed the critical factors for benefi cial and enduring partnerships. The key lessons from this research are that, for many small-scale growers to form successful partnerships with other investors, they need: • increased knowledge of the operations and components of commercial forestry; • improved access to competitive markets; • increased knowledge of the dynamics of forest product markets; • improved capacity of local farmer forest groups to share experiences and information, and build their knowledge of commercial forestry; and • reduced administrative and fi nancial burden imposed by government on small-scale forestry operations...|$|R

40|$|The {{decision}} {{to invest in}} forestry {{is based on the}} assessment {{of a wide range of}} factors which include the location and amenity of the land and its wildlife and sporting potential. In the context of <b>commercial</b> <b>forestry</b> schemes however, forestry investment is underpinned by the likely financial return on capital invested. The approach described in this paper involves modelling the physical and economic characteristics of <b>commercial</b> <b>forestry</b> using a structured, systematic sample of over 3000 sites throughout Scotland. The objective is to identify the location and area of land with afforestation potential on the basis of returns to capital and Expectation Land Value. Output from the model suggests that <b>commercial</b> <b>forestry</b> is competitive with agriculture on approximately 1. 3 million ha. Greatest potential exists on Land Capability for Agriculture classes 4, 5 and 6. The ability to assess the effect of changes in grant support, land and timber prices is an important feature of the model. It has the scope for application at regional and national levels, and particularly in the development and ex-post assessment of Indicative Forestry Strategies. Future work will concentrate on expanding the model to include more species and to improve the integration with computer-based Geographical Information Systems...|$|R
