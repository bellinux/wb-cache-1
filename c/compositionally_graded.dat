40|$|The authors uses laser {{additive}} manufacturing (LAM) as a combinatorial method for synthesizing microstructurally and <b>compositionally</b> piecewise <b>graded</b> bulk alloys. Authors fabricate blocks {{consisting of a}} sequence of ≈ 500 [*]μm thick tool steel layers, each with different chemical composition, by laser metal deposition where alloy powders are deposited layer-wise on a substrate. The reference materials are a Cr–Mo–V hot working tool steel and a Ni-based maraging steel. The layers between them consist of corresponding blends of the two materials with varying composition from layer to layer (alloy volume fractions 80 : 20, 60 : 40, 40 : 60, and 20 : 80). The bulk alloy is hot rolled and heat treated. Subsequently each layer is characterized for microstructure, chemical composition and mechanical properties using electron back scatter diffraction, tensile testing, and indentation. The approach is an efficient high-throughput method enabling rapid probing of novel compositional alloy blends. It can be applied for finding new alloys both, by LAM and for LAM. For the tool steel blends synthesized here, authors observe that the Cr–Mo–V tool steel, when mixed with the Ni-base maraging steel, can be continuously tuned for a strength-ductility profile {{in the range of}} 800 – 1650 [*]MPa strength and 15 – 25 % tensile elongation...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} free space charges on hysteresis-loop measurement of <b>compositionally</b> <b>graded</b> ferroelectrics and found that they are quite likely {{to be responsible for}} the "polarization offsets" observed in experiments. Taking into account conduction by those free space charges, or time-dependent space-charge-limited conduction, our computer simulation of <b>compositionally</b> <b>graded</b> lead zirconate titanate, which is placed in the Sawyer–Tower circuit and driven by an alternating applied voltage, produced shifting of measured hysteresis loops where the shift magnitudes are comparable with published experimental data. It also produced the key features as observed in experiments: The "offsets:" (a) have a monotonous increase with electric-field amplitude, (b) change in direction when the composition gradient is inverted, and (c) develop like the typical charging-up of a capacitor.

40|$|Field-dependent {{polarized}} neutron reflectivity (PNR) and magnetometry {{are employed}} {{to study the}} magnetic properties of <b>compositionally</b> uniform and <b>graded</b> FePtCu films {{as a function of}} annealing temperature (TA). The PNR results are able to directly probe the compositional and anisotropy variations through the film thickness. Further details about how the reversal mechanisms evolve are then elucidated by using a first-order reversal curve technique. The reversal of the graded sample annealed at 300 [*]°C occurs by an initial rapid switching of the dominant soft A 1 phase toward the surface of the film, followed by the gradual reversal of the residual hard phase components toward the bottom. This indicates that the anisotropy gradient is not well established at this low TA. A fundamentally different mechanism is found after annealing at 400 [*]°C, where the rapid switching of the entire film is preceded by a gradual reversal of the soft layers. This suggests that the anisotropy gradient has become better established through the film thickness. The field-dependent PNR measurements confirm the existence of an anisotropy gradient, where the lower (higher) anisotropy portions are now toward the bottom (top) of the film because of the Cu compositional gradient. However, after annealing at 500 [*]°C, a single rapid reversal is found, indicating the formation of a uniform hard film. In this case, PNR demonstrates a more uniform magnetic depth profile that is consistent with a uniform reference sample, suggesting significant interdiffusion of the Cu is degrading the compositional and induced anisotropy gradient at this elevated TA...|$|R

It is found that the <b>compositionally</b> <b>graded</b> films exhibited a significant enhancement in dielectric properties, energy-storage performance and ECE, which was, {{in contrast to the}} single-composition PLZT film, contributed by the strain and the gradient of polarization near the interfaces between the adjacent layers.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} description for the effective linear and nonlinear optical properties of <b>compositionally</b> <b>graded</b> films consisting of nonlinear metal particles and linear dielectric particles. The volume fraction of metal particles varies along the direction {{perpendicular to the}} film. To account for the composition gradient, we resort to effective medium approximation to investigate the equivalent (local) dielectric constant and third-order nonlinear susceptibility. As a result, the effective second-rank dielectric constant tensor and fourth-rank nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor are directly determined by regarding the graded film as a multilayer one. We predict that for a power-law composition gradient p(z) =zm, the increase of m leads to large enhancement of the optical nonlinearity and hence the figure of merit in the high-frequency region. On the other hand, for a given total volume fraction, {{we find that the}} optical nonlinearity enhancement for the composition gradient case is larger than the one in non-graded case. Moreover, we can choose different graded profile to realize the appreciable optical nonlinearity enhancement. Therefore, the <b>compositionally</b> <b>graded</b> film can be served as a suitable candidate material for obtaining the large optical nonlinearity and optimal figure of merit.

40|$|The initial {{motivation}} {{of the research}} presented here was to understand some novel phenomena reported in <b>compositionally</b> <b>graded</b> ferroelectric films. The phenomenon of primary interest was the translation of ferroelectric hysteresis loops along what is normally regarded as the polarization axis, which was interpreted as a polarization offset with anamolously large and unphysical values. The fabrication of <b>compositionally</b> <b>graded</b> Pb(Zr,Ti) O 3 (PZT) thin films is presented along with the observation of hysteresis loop translations. These hysteresis loop translations {{were found to be}} due to a dc voltage offset which develops on the sample capacitor. In addition, these voltage offsets were found {{to be sensitive to the}} oxygen partial pressure of the atmosphere in which the films were situated. Similar oxygen dependent voltage offsets were observed for non-graded PZT films. It is proposed that the observed voltage offsets are ultimately the result of a redistribution of oxygen vacancies at the film surface. This hypothesis is supported by the observation of oxygen dependent voltage offsets in yttria stabilized zirconia films. Two models are proposed which attempt to explain how a redistribution of oxygen vacancies might result in the observed voltage offsets. These models are presented along with experimental results which offer insights into their validity. Finally, a course for future studies is recommended. ...|$|E
