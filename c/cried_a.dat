500|$|Jennings' work on In Search of America and the September 11 attacks {{contributed to}} his {{decision}} in 2003 to become a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. [...] "I think that 9/11 and the subsequent travel I did in the country afterwards made me feel connected in new ways," [...] he said. [...] "And when {{we were working on}} the America project I {{spent a lot of time}} on the road, which meant away from my editor's desk, and I just got much more connected to the Founding Fathers' dreams and ideas for the future." [...] His work had prepared him well for the citizenship test, which he passed easily. [...] "Can you imagine I, who just finished a whole series on America and had been an anchorperson for an American broadcast...could you imagine if I had failed?" [...] he asked. [...] "It would have been horrendous." [...] The anchor's formal pledge of allegiance took place at a regular citizenship ceremony on May 30 in Lower Manhattan. The occasion overwhelmed him. [...] "I went in the front door and came out the front door. They were regular people. They were very touching. And I <b>cried</b> <b>a</b> little bit — my kids didn't cry, but I <b>cried</b> <b>a</b> bit — but I'm a fairly emotional character anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Olga {{experienced}} {{her first}} brush with violence at age fifteen, when she witnessed {{the assassination of}} the government minister Pyotr Stolypin during a performance at the Kiev Opera House. [...] "Olga and Tatiana had followed me back to the box and saw everything that happened", Tsar Nicholas II wrote to his mother, Dowager Empress Maria, on September 10, 1911. [...] "…It had made a great impression on Tatiana, who <b>cried</b> <b>a</b> lot, and they both slept badly." [...] Three years later, she saw gunshot wounds close up when she trained to become a Red Cross nurse. Olga, her sister Tatiana, and her mother Tsarina Alexandra treated wounded soldiers at a hospital on the grounds of Tsarskoye Selo.|$|E

500|$|He {{applied for}} a presidential pardon in May, to no avail. Peter visited him in jail several times, where one {{prisoner}} said Reich {{was known as the}} [...] "flying saucer guy" [...] and the [...] "Sex Box man." [...] Reich told Peter that he <b>cried</b> <b>a</b> lot, and wanted Peter to let himself cry too, believing that tears are the [...] "great softener." [...] His last letter to his son was on 22 October 1957, when he said he was looking forward to being released on 10 November, having served one third of his sentence. A parole hearing had been scheduled for a few days before that date. He wrote that he and Peter had a date for a meal at the Howard Johnson restaurant near Peter's school.|$|E
500|$|The storyline was {{concluded}} with a week's worth of episodes focusing on the pair's wedding and fallout. A trailer, which took over 15 hours to film, was produced to promote the episodes and featured several characters dressed in black and who could expose her affair with Carl, watching Mercedes go down the aisle. During the trailer Mercedes <b>cried</b> <b>a</b> black tear, done by the show's make-up artists putting black paint in Metcalfe's eye. Norbury opined that Riley {{was caught up in}} planning the wedding, and that his feelings for Mercedes were [...] "very strong", adding that Riley [...] "loves her to bits and he thinks that she's everything". In the lead up to the wedding it was shown that potential guests who could reveal the affair included Jacqui, Seth, Carl, Mercedes, Warren, Mitzeee and Doug Carter (PJ Brennan).|$|E
500|$|Only {{three weeks}} before the voter {{referendum}} in Dade County, a state gay rights law to protect homosexuals from discrimination in employment, public services, and housing in Minnesota was defeated. The loss was {{due in large part to}} the efforts of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, and once more, caught gay activists completely by surprise. The Twin Cities' gay community was much more active than Miami's; both Minneapolis and St. Paul had passed gay rights laws three years before. State senator Allan Spear—the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in the U.S.—served in St. Paul. Spear called it a [...] "victory for bigots" [...] on the senate floor, then went into his office and <b>cried.</b> <b>A</b> group of guerrilla activists struck Archbishop John Roach a week after the vote by throwing a chocolate cream pie at him as he spoke to receive the National Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews.|$|E

2500|$|As soon as our line, set on its jolting way, emerged, I {{felt that}} two men close by had been hit, two shadows {{fell to the}} ground and rolled under our feet, one with a high-pitched scream and the other in silence like an ox. Another {{disappeared}} with a movement like a madman, {{as if he had been}} carried away. Instinctively, we closed ranks and pushed each other forward, always forward, and the wound in our midst closed itself. The warrant officer stopped and raised his sword, dropped it, fell to his knees, his kneeling body falling backwards in jerks, his helmet fell on his heels and he remained there, his head uncovered, looking up to the sky. The line has promptly split to avoid breaking this immobility. [...] But we couldn't see the lieutenant any more. No more superiors, then... A moment's hesitation held back the human wave which had reached the beginning of the plateau. The hoarse sound of air passing through our lungs could be heard over the stamping of feet. [...] Forward! <b>cried</b> <b>a</b> soldier. So we all marched forward, moving faster and faster in our race towards the abyss.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983 Dahl {{reviewed}} Tony Clifton's God <b>Cried,</b> <b>a</b> {{picture book}} about the siege of West Beirut by the Israeli army during the 1982 Lebanon War. Dahl's review stated that the book would make readers [...] "violently anti-Israeli", writing, [...] "I am not anti-Semitic. I am anti-Israel." [...] Dahl told a reporter in 1983, [...] "There's a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity ... I mean {{there is always a}} reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn't just pick on them for no reason." [...] Dahl maintained friendships with a number of Jews, including philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, who said, [...] "I thought he might say anything. Could have been pro-Arab or pro-Jew. There was no consistent line. He was a man who followed whims, which meant he would blow up in one direction, so to speak." [...] Amelia Foster, director of the Roald Dahl Museum in Great Missenden, states, [...] "This is again an example of how Dahl refused to take anything seriously, even himself. He was very angry at the Israelis. He had a childish reaction {{to what was going on}} in Israel. Dahl wanted to provoke, as he always provoked at dinner. His publisher was a Jew, his agent was a Jew... and he thought nothing but good things of them. He asked me to be his managing director, and I'm Jewish." ...|$|E

2500|$|The final {{took place}} on 27 June 1931, with 70,000 spectators {{attending}} to see Mick the Miller take on [...] "The Black Express" [...] Ryland R. The two dogs were both matched as joint favourites for the final at odds of 13–8. The other four dogs in the race were Golden Hammer, Mick's Fancy, Seldom Lad and Brunswick Bill. Just after 9pm, Ryland {{is out of the}} traps ahead of the others once again, with Mick in last position as they go around the first bend. Ryland led all the way until the final turn where Seldom Lad closed on him. The two dogs made contact and swung wide, the race steward spotted that Ryland had turned to snap at Seldom Lad and set off the no–race klaxon. The noise is drowned out by the crowd as Mick the Miller is suddenly coming through the pack. Despite being bumped earlier in the race, he found the inside rail and moved up past the others, beating Golden Hammer by a head at the line. The announcer repeats that it is a no race to the disappointment of the crowd. Ryland R was disqualified for [...] "nosing and impeding" [...] another dog. Phiddy Kempton, Mick's owner at the time, broke down into tears, [...] "Mick has won! My darling Mick has won!" [...] he <b>cried.</b> <b>A</b> re–run was ordered for 9:55pm, while the crowd began to get unruly. Kempton was refusing to allow Mick to compete in the re–run, adamant he had already run the Derby. The directors of the Greyhound Racing Association were in attendance, and knowing the effect that both the two favourites not running in the final of the Derby would mean for the sport, convinced Kempton to run Mick.|$|E

40|$|Aims:  To compare vip 184 ΔP gene {{expression}} time course and Vip 184 protein yield {{under the control}} of promoters and Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences of vip 184, <b>cry</b> 3 <b>A</b> and <b>cry</b> 1 <b>A</b> gene from Bacillus thuringiensis respectively. Methods and Results:  Derived from the shuttle vector pHT 3101, recombinant plasmids pHPT 3, pHTP 3 AΔP and pHTP 1 AΔP were constructed with the native vip 184 gene and the vip 184 ΔP gene, either {{under the control of}} promoters and SD sequences of <b>cry</b> 3 <b>A</b> or <b>cry</b> 1 <b>A</b> genes. When the above plasmids were transformed into an acrystalliferous B. thuringiensis strain Cry−B, their expression time course were consistent with those of vip 184, <b>cry</b> 3 <b>A</b> and <b>cry</b> 1 <b>A</b> gene respectively. The maximum yields of Vip 184 protein were increased when under the control of promoters plus SD sequences of <b>cry</b> 3 <b>A</b> and <b>cry</b> 1 <b>A</b> gene. Conclusions:  The results showed that both <b>cry</b> 3 <b>A</b> and <b>cry</b> 1 <b>A</b> promoter/SD sequence combinations were able to enhance synthesis of Vip 184 and change its expression time course. Significance and Impact of the Study:  Both <b>cry</b> 3 <b>A</b> and <b>cry</b> 1 <b>A</b> promoter/SD systems offer a method for improving the expression efficacy of the vip 184 gene in B. thuringiensis and it is possible to co-express the vip 184 gene and cry genes and accumulate Vip 184 in the form of inclusion bodies by these systems in order to construct novel useful B. thuringiensis engineered strains...|$|R
