After the tournament, Williams told the press that she was injured, blaming a lack of fitness and a knee injury for keeping her off the court. However, in her biography, Serena claims that she was {{actually}} suffering from depression. Serena stayed away from pro tennis for six months during the 2006 season. After she had shut herself off from {{the world for a}} period, Williams saw a therapist daily. After a chance meeting with a young girl who idolized Serena and believed that she could still win, Williams signed up to play in Cincinnati, her first tournament since Melbourne. Williams had slipped to 139 in the world, the lowest ranking she had held since 1997. On her return, Williams defeated Myskina and Bethanie Mattek, before losing in the semifinals to Vera Zvonareva. She also reached the semifinals in Los Angeles, losing to Janković in straight sets. At the US Open, Williams needed a wildcard to enter the tournament, as her ranking at the <b>cut-off</b> <b>time</b> was 139th in the world, outside the automatic 102. However her ranking had improved to 79th by the time the tournament came around. She lost to top-seeded Mauresmo in the fourth round. Following the U.S. Open, she did not play again in 2006, ending the year ranked world No. 95, her lowest year-end ranking since 1997.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of {{the factors}} that {{contribute}} to delay in seeking medical treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) provides the basis for interventions that are intended to facilitate prompt care-seeking behaviour. However, operational definitions of delay time vary across research studies. The use of inconsistent <b>cut-off</b> <b>times</b> to distinguish between delayers and non-delayers is likely to compromise comparability and generalizability of the findings across studies. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the impact of inconsistent operationalization of delay, in terms of <b>cut-off</b> <b>times,</b> on the validity of research findings pertaining to identifying its predictors. Secondary data analysis was performed using a sample of 73 patients who had recently experienced out-of-hospital AMI and concluded that their symptoms were related to the heart. Several regression models were built to examine the influence of using different <b>cut-off</b> <b>times</b> (1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 hours, median delay) on the number and nature of predictors of AMI care-seeking delay. The impact of varying <b>cut-off</b> <b>times</b> on the explained variance, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values associated with each regression model was examined. The use of different <b>cut-off</b> <b>times</b> produced different sets of independent predictors, which varied in number and nature. The variance explained by the different regression models as well as their classification indices varied. Use of different <b>cut-off</b> <b>times</b> for the definition of delay time led to inconsistent results. Thus, it is recommended that criteria be established among clinicians and researchers with regard to operationally defining care-seeking delay for AMI. © McGill University School of Nursing...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (AQT) {{is a brief}} {{test that}} can {{identify}} cognitive impairment. AQT has been validated in Arabic, English, Greek, Japanese, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop Italian criterion-referenced norms for AQT. Methods: AQT consists of three test plates where the patient shall rapidly name (1) the color of 40 blue, red, yellow, or black squares (AQT color), (2) the form of 40 black figures (circles, squares, triangles, or rectangles; AQT form), (3) the color and form of 40 figures (consisting of previous colors and forms; AQT color-form). The AQT test was administered to 121 Italian cognitively healthy primary care patients (age range: 45 - 90 years). Their mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 28. 8 ± 0. 9 points (range 26 - 30 points). AQT naming times in seconds were used for developing preliminary criterion <b>cut-off</b> <b>times</b> for different age groups. Results: Age was found to have a significant moderate positive correlation with AQT naming times color (r = 0. 65, p < 0. 001), form (r = 0. 53, p < 0. 001), color-form (r = 0. 63, p < 0. 001) and a moderate negative correlation with MMSE score (r = - 0. 44, p < 0. 001) and AQT naming times differed significantly between younger (45 - 55 years old), older (56 - 70 years old), and the oldest (71 - 90 years old) participants. Years of education correlated positively but weakly with MMSE score (r = 0. 27, p = 0. 003) and negatively but weakly with AQT color (r = - 0. 16, p = ns), form (r = - 0. 24, p = 0. 007), and color-form (r = - 0. 19, p = 0. 005). We established preliminary <b>cut-off</b> <b>times</b> for the AQT test based on + 1 and + 2 standard deviations according to the approach in other languages and settings. Conclusions: This is the first Italian normative AQT study. Future studies of AQT - a test useful for dementia screening in primary care - will eventually refine <b>cut-off</b> <b>times</b> for normality balancing sensitivity and specificity in cognitive diagnostics...|$|R

It is endangered due to superfluous and unsustainable harvesting methods. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility of crop cultivation in terms of dryland farming and the best operation method for collecting gum resin. For this purpose, the effects of different scarification methods (traditional, concave and staircase) and cut-off frequencies (5, 10 and 13 times) on gum yield of the five-year-old plants were studied at Toroq farm in Mashhad. The treatments were studied under a split plot structure in time experiment which was arranged in a completely randomized design with three replications. The rate of the root gum production and the rate of plant survival in the years after the withdrawal were measured, and finally the data were analyzed. Results showed no significant differences among cutting methods at p< 0. 05. The yield of gum was affected by times of harvesting and the highest yield was observed (p< 0. 01) in 13 <b>cut-off</b> <b>times</b> with 31. 67 g/plant. The lowest gum yields were seen in 5 <b>cut-off</b> <b>times</b> with 5. 84 g/plant. The traditional cutting method destroyed crown buds and caused the death of the plant (p< 0. 01).

All patients admitted to the general and paediatric intensive care units and expected to require mechanical ventilation for a period > or = 3 days were enrolled. Surveillance cultures of throat and rectum were obtained on admission and thereafter twice weekly to distinguish micro-organisms that were imported into the unit from those acquired during the stay on the unit. A total of 130 adults and 400 children were studied. In the adult population, 70 % of lower airway infections were classified as ICU-acquired by the 48 h cut-off and 48 % by the criterion of carriage; on the paediatric ICU the percentages were 65 % and 20 %, respectively. To separate imported from ICU-acquired infections, eight days was optimal in the adult population and 10 days in the paediatric population. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for a <b>time</b> <b>cut-off</b> of eight days for adults were 86, 77, 80, 83 %, respectively, and using 10 days for children were 87, 62, 90, 56 %, respectively. The use of the 48 h cut-off rule classifies patients as having nosocomial pneumonia, when in fact the infections are commonly caused by microorganisms carried in by the patients. In contrast, using the carriage method, the proportion of lung infections due to nosocomial bacteria was relatively small and was a late phenomenon. Although in prolonging the <b>time</b> <b>cut-off</b> {{the difference between the}} two types of classification was shorter, <b>time</b> <b>cut-offs</b> were still found to be unreliable for distinguishing imported from unit-acquired lower airway infections...|$|R

An electronic search was performed in seven databases. The systematic review included 10 cohort studies. It was not possible to conduct meta-analysis; therefore a qualitative analysis was assessed. The majority of studies evaluated feeding habits by means of questionnaires and conducted a single examination. Three studies observed that bottle feeding was significantly associated with overjet and posterior crossbite. Studies reported several <b>cut-off</b> <b>times</b> for breastfeeding (varying from 1 month up to 3 years of age) and several types of malocclusion.
