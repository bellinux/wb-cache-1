5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of its A330 fleet {{and the introduction of}} Boeing 777 long-haul aircraft, the airline converted some of its older Boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft to freighters to meet <b>cargo</b> <b>market</b> demands. EVA Air Cargo established its European Cargo Center in Brussels in 2003 and opened its Southern China Cargo Center in Hong Kong in 2006.|$|E
5|$|While the {{air cargo}} {{industry}} in Bangladesh grew by 16.5% {{in the fiscal}} year 2003–04, Biman's cargo operations remained stagnant when private operators such as Bismillah Airlines, Best Aviation and Air Bangladesh produced a 108% growth from the previous year. The private operators increased their share of the <b>cargo</b> <b>market</b> by 10.6% and were responsible for handling 24% of the total 99,000tonnes of cargo at the expense of both Biman and foreign airlines which saw a reduction in their shares by 4.6% and 6.0% respectively. Foreign airlines handled 47% of the total cargo with Biman taking on the remaining 29%.|$|E

30|$|We {{now turn}} to the {{interpretation}} of the quadrants in the framework. The quadrants are based on the values of the CM-component and the C-component of the shift-share analysis. The balls located in the upper right quadrant are called ‘Obvious CO 2 winners’; they deserve this name because these balls depict transport modes that have increased their market share and are specialized in <b>cargo</b> <b>markets</b> that have above-average growth rates. This is an ideal situation from a CO 2 reduction perspective for two reasons: these modes are active in the ‘right’ <b>cargo</b> <b>markets,</b> and they are competitive, offering a good starting position for attracting more cargo in future. The balls in the lower right quadrant are called ‘Potential CO 2 winners’, as these modes are competitive but specialized in the ‘wrong’ <b>cargo</b> <b>markets,</b> i.e. those with below-average growth. Consequently, although these modes already possess factors that make them competitive, it would be desirable for these <b>cargo</b> <b>markets</b> to be reorientated, so that they become more involved in the above-average growth markets. Should they succeed, these balls will shift upwards and become ‘Obvious CO 2 winners’. The balls in the lower left quadrant are called ‘Obvious CO 2 losers’, as they have lost tons due to a negative competition effect and their specialization in the wrong markets. The ‘Masked CO 2 losers’, situated in the upper left quadrant, find themselves in a dangerous position; their lack of competitiveness is masked {{by the fact that they}} have experienced (modest) growth in the number of tons transported because they are active in above-average growing <b>cargo</b> <b>markets.</b> However, they run the risk of ending up in the lower left ‘Obvious CO 2 losers’ quadrant should these <b>cargo</b> <b>markets</b> experience a decline in future.|$|R

25|$|The Viscounts were {{supplemented}} with three Curtiss C-46 Commandos in 1957, which were first overhauled in Italy. This allowed {{all but one}} C-47 to be sold. The Curtisses were predominantly used in the <b>cargo</b> <b>market,</b> and common operation was the hauling of flowers to Norway. Two of the aircraft were wet leased to SAS from 1959 to operate their freight flights. The Viscounts were largely reserved for passenger charter, and most commonly leased to Air France and SAS. The latter used them regularly on their flights to Northern Norway and pained some of the aircraft in their livery. They were also commonly used on charter flights to Svalbard.|$|E
25|$|After {{the merger}} with Shanghai Airlines, China Eastern Airlines {{signaled}} {{that it would}} combine the two carriers' cargo subsidiaries as well. The airline's new subsidiary cargo carrier, consisting of the assets of China Cargo Airlines, Great Wall Airlines and Shanghai Airlines Cargo, commenced operations in 2011 from its base in Shanghai, China's largest air <b>cargo</b> <b>market.</b> China Eastern Airlines signed a strategic cccooperation frameworkagreement with Shanghai Airport Group, which controls both Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport and Shanghai Pudong International Airport. The airline will allocate more capacity to Pudong Airport to open more international routes and boost flight frequencies on existing international and domestic trunk routes.|$|E
25|$|The Air Cargo Division of the Changi Airport Group (CAG) {{manages the}} Changi Airfreight Centre {{located in the}} north of the airport premises. The airport handled 1.81million tonnes of air cargo in 2012, making it the 7th busiest {{airfreight}} hub {{in the world and the}} fifth busiest in Asia. Due to Singapore's large electronics sector, electrical components constitute a significant part of the total cargo traffic handled at the airport. Changi airport has initiated attempts to expand into the perishable air <b>cargo</b> <b>market.</b> In 2015, Changi Airport handled 1,853,087 tonnes of air freight. Air Cargo World awarded the 2013 Air Cargo Excellence Award to Changi Airport for handling more than 1,000,000 tonnes of cargo in Asia.|$|E
30|$|To {{describe}} {{this as an}} analogy with a pie: a positive value on the vertical axis implies that the pies (<b>cargo</b> <b>markets)</b> in which a transport mode has a relatively large share have grown between 2005 and 2014. A high positive value on the horizontal axis means that a transport mode has captured a larger part of the pies between 2005 and 2014.|$|R

30|$|The {{presented}} framework visualizes in {{a glance}} how freight transport modes perform from a CO 2 emissions perspective in a modal shift context. The {{combination of the}} size {{and the color of}} the balls immediately expresses whether, and to what extent, the modal shifts have resulted in reduced CO 2 emissions. Additionally, the position of the balls in the framework’s quadrants express whether a transport mode is likely to contribute to the decarbonization of freight transport in future. A shift based on improvements to a transport mode’s competitiveness is more likely to last in future than a shift based on that transport mode’s overrepresentation in above-average growing markets. In the latter case, the transport mode’s position in the framework is highly subject to the volatility of <b>cargo</b> <b>markets.</b> A transport mode’s position is more stable if it is mainly based on its competitiveness, because such competiveness will mute any possible impact from future declines of the <b>cargo</b> <b>markets</b> in which it is overrepresented..|$|R
25|$|Maersk {{established}} a cargo division, Maersk Air Cargo, in 1982. Due to regulations, it only {{acted as a}} ground handling agent for overseas airlines, the largest being Cathay Pacific. When the <b>cargo</b> <b>market</b> was deregulate din 1987, Star Air was {{established a}}s a separate cargo company directly under the Maersk Group. Incorporated on 1 September 1987, it bought an existing hangar on the south sector of Copenhagen Airport. Three Fokker F-27-600s were leased and converted to combi-freighters. These could be converted from freighter to passenger configuration in half an hour. Star Air originally had a mix of operations. One part was corporate charters, one was wet leasing to other airlines, one was charter and domestic operations for Maersk Air, and finally it conducted European hauls for freight companies, including Federal Express, TNT and United Parcel Service (UPS). A Star Air F-27 crashed during landing at Cologne Bonn Airport on 26 May 1988, killing the crew of two.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} widely-traded {{commodities}} in the world throughout history, sugar accounts for around 2% of the global dry <b>cargo</b> <b>market.</b> International sugar prices show great volatility, ranging from around 3 to over 60 cents [...] per pound in the [...] 50 years. About 100 of the world's 180 countries produce sugar from beet or cane, a few more refine raw sugar to produce white sugar, and all countries consume sugar. Consumption of sugar ranges from around 3 kilograms per person per annum in Ethiopia to around 40kg/person/yr in Belgium. Consumption per capita rises with income per capita until it reaches a plateau of around 35kg per person per year in middle income countries.|$|E
2500|$|Overall {{demand for}} the 747-8 {{turned out to be}} below Boeing's initial {{projections}} as well, which led to several reductions in production rate. Production was initially decreased from 2 to 1.75 aircraft per month in April 2013 and then reduced further to 1.5 aircraft per month in October 2013. [...] On June 25, 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that the order backlog was down to 32 and Boeing had decided to reduce production to one aircraft per month in 2016. [...] In January 2016, Boeing confirmed that it was reducing 747-8 production to 0.5 per month beginning in September 2016, incurring a $569 million post-tax charge against its fourth-quarter 2015 profits. The chief reason given was that the recovery of the air <b>cargo</b> <b>market</b> had stalled, resulting in slowed {{demand for the}} 747 freighter.|$|E

2500|$|Boeing {{cited the}} 747-8F {{as the main}} driver behind {{potential}} future 747-8 orders. To help reduce production costs in the meantime and maintain the 747 production line's viability, {{the company plans to}} integrate the 747 and 767 production lines more closely with each other. Boeing expected the <b>cargo</b> <b>market</b> to improve by mid-2019 and were planning to increase the 747's production rate back to 1/month from then on. However, in July 2016, this production rate increase was cancelled, i.e. 747 production remained at 0.5 per month. At the same time, the company announced another after tax charge of $814 million, reflecting a lower estimation of frames to be produced and revenue realised. In an SEC filing submitted at the same time, Boeing stated that if they were [...] "unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, [...] it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747." ...|$|E

2500|$|Moreover, {{economic}} {{weakness in}} air <b>cargo</b> <b>markets</b> has slowed demand for cargo conversions. Since {{the cost of}} replacing a 747-400 is high (an airline must purchase or lease another wide-body), some operators choose to fly the 747-400 to the conclusion of its accepted useful life and then scrap it. [...] The current parts resale value for this aircraft {{has been reduced to}} its engines. When a 26-year-old 747-400 owned by Delta Airlines flew through a violent hailstorm, Delta indicated it was likely the plane would be scrapped. George Dimitroff, head of valuations for FlightGlobal, estimated the aircraft's value before the incident at about $8 million. [...] He noted {{that this is not the}} same as its insured value.|$|R
5000|$|The act {{of hiring}} a ship to carry cargo is called chartering. Outside special bulk <b>cargo</b> <b>markets,</b> ships are hired by {{three types of}} charter agreements: the voyage charter, the time charter, and the bareboat charter. [...] In a voyage charter, the {{charterer}} rents the vessel from the loading port to the discharge port. [...] In a time charter, the vessel is hired for a set period of time, to perform voyages as the charterer directs. [...] In a bareboat charter, the charterer acts as the ship's operator and manager, taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel.

30|$|We {{conclude}} that for freight transport with an origin, destination or {{both in the}} Netherlands, a modal shift from road (−[*] 3, 0 percentage points), to rail (+[*] 0, 2 percentage points), and to inland waterways (+[*] 2, 8 percentage points) occurred in the period 2005 – 2014. No transported freight was shifted in the less than 100 [*]km distance market. This implies that the shift for the total market wholly occurred {{in the more than}} 100 [*]km distance market. A shift-share analysis, decomposing {{growth in the number of}} tons transported by each mode, for the total transport market reveals that the modal shift mainly results from rail being specialized in the above-average growing <b>cargo</b> <b>markets</b> and from inland waterways becoming more competitive between 2005 and 2014.|$|R

40|$|The {{fluctuation}} {{of shipping}} freight rates (freight rate risk) {{is an important}} source of market risk for all participants in the freight markets including hedge funds, commodity and energy producers. We measure the freight rate risk by the Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach. A range of parametric and non-parametric VaR methods is applied to various popular freight markets for dry and wet cargoes. Backtesting is conducted in two stages by means of statistical tests and a subjective loss function that uses the Expected Shortfall, respectively. We find that the simplest non-parametric methods should be used to measure freight rate risk. In addition, freight rate risk is greater in the wet <b>cargoes</b> <b>markets.</b> The margins in the growing freight derivatives markets should be set accordingly.
