50|$|Thematically, {{research}} is often {{concerned with the}} political dimension of mediated cross-border communication. Examples include studies {{on the impact of}} mediated cross-border communication on foreign policy (CNN effect), political change (media and democratization, zapatista effect, boomerang effect), research on official government <b>communication</b> <b>targeting</b> foreign <b>audiences</b> (e.g., certain kinds of International broadcasting, Public diplomacy) and questions on media representations of the developing world (e.g., New World Information and Communication Order). Apart from that, global mass communication ethics and the globalization of entertainment constitute further important topics.An at least implicit common feature to almost all of the aforementioned topics is their general interest in answering the question to what extent nationally, culturally or otherwise defined media systems influence each other, converge or whether they can pertain distinct identities under conditions of mediated cross-border communication.|$|R

30|$|The current {{findings}} highlight {{important factors}} influencing {{the promotion of}} advertising. The concepts of textual relevance matching are useful for targeted advertising, typical examples of which include keyword-targeted (e.g., AdWords of Google) and content-targeted advertising (e.g., AdSense of Google). Hence, a customized advertisement {{can be associated with}} one or more keywords, which can be manually selected by advertisers. Language is a medium of <b>communication,</b> and the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> often relies on the presentation of their native language in advertisements. Language is a useful criterion for segmenting advertising markets, and advertisers should be able to include this in schemes to customize their own advertising plans without wasting network or processing resources.

40|$|Many {{companies}} have often forgotten that promotion {{is an element}} of marketing-mix. Therelore their promotional campain has not always been as effective as it could be. In designing and developing marketing communication one should consider all elements of marketing-mix as well as all promotional tools. They together create a promotional system in which all the elements are Mutually reinforcing and give the system the most efficient and effective power. The major thrust of promotional strategy is generally thought of in terms of four explicit promotional elements, i. e., advertising, personal selling, sales promotion and public relations. However, it is necessary to emphasize at the ouset that these four explicit elements work in conjunction with other components of the marketing-mix. The other elements in the mix — product, price and place — not only inlluence the manner in which one can handle the explicit promotional tools, but can also convay a type of communication impact of their own. This type marketing communication is called implicit promotion.

The poetry was written for a highly selected audience, centred around the library’ and court of the Ptolemy, and this determined the nature of both the poetry and its 'publication' or <b>communication</b> to the <b>target</b> <b>audience.</b> The most significant aspects of the poetry are: its heightened literary style; the transition from a sung to a recited text; the shifting of the place of communication from aristocratic banquet and public area during the previous period of the city-state to the exclusive audience of the ruler’s palace or the literary coterie; the use of erudite reference in the poem; increased experimentation by the poets in form, theme and style; and the strong sense and pursuit of individualism...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Broader {{acceptance}} of entomophagy (i. e. human consumption of insects) {{will depend on}} factors that impact consumers’ perceptions of edible insects. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how a broad-based information session would affect consumers’ perceptions and attitudes about an edible insect product. Design: During a taste testing session, preceded or followed by an information session about entomophagy, participants rated the organoleptic characteristics of two bread samples on 9 -point hedonic scales. The two bread samples were identical, though one was faux-labelled as containing an insect product. Findings: General Linear Model (GLM) analysis showed effects of gender, information session exposure, entomophagy familiarity, and entomophagy experience on participants’ ratings of the samples. Wilcoxon‑Mann-Whitney ranked sum tests showed that appearance, flavour, and overall liking were significantly better rated for the bread sample labelled as insect-free by participants who attended the presentation a priori. Potential ways to improve information content and delivery in favour of encouraging dietary shifts are discussed. Practical applications: This study shows that information about insect-based products could change consumers’ perceptions of such products. The results provide clues regarding how the food industry can adapt <b>communication</b> for <b>target</b> <b>audiences.</b> Originality: Actual edible insect products were not used in this study. Paradoxically, it is the first to show the impact of an information session on the acceptability of edible insect products, by revealing participants’ perceptual expectations. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The Social Exchange Theory (SET) served as the framework and research objectives were based on the concept of Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC). The study found the correct name of the organization appeared in only 56. 6 % (n= 611) of units; appearances of images, graphics, and the official slogan were also minimal. Primarily, the study identified a need for increased specification and clarity in the guidelines in order to promote increased consistency. This study serves as a benchmark for future measurement, a basis for recommended changes, and a call for other state extension agencies to examine communication in similar studies. The researcher recommends the organization makes substantial edits and additions to the branding guidelines, provides employees with training, and implements a regular evaluation of communication efforts to monitor brand representation and communication effectiveness. Additionally, the researcher addresses the need for an IMC model specific to extension, to help communicators implement more strategic and measurable efforts...|$|R
40|$|Optimal <b>communication</b> with a <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> from {{a mobile}} {{platform}} remains elusive, particularly {{as a result}} of evolving phone technology and users’ privacy concerns. Since it is standard practice now for consumers to access the internet via mobile phones, messages should not address a general audience but unobtrusively blend with the individual user’s daily life. While many mobile marketers rely on the “push” technique through mobile messaging, various studies indicate that pushing messages is not always efficient and can alienate mobile users who prefer unique forms of brand-related engagement. The view informing this article is that barriers hampering mobile marketing such as perceived untrustworthiness, irrelevance and low value could be eliminated through mobile content marketing, and in particular through unobtrusive pulling techniques using patrons as proposed in Kaplan’s (2012) classification. Based on the results of a directed qualitative content analysis of industry white papers on mobile marketing, this study is centred on a proposition that a content marketing approach should be promoted for mobile marketing communication.

It is a trend to create job portals in social networks. These are currently an integrated part of <b>communication</b> with <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> and therefore also an objects of attention and reflexions. It is also the topic of this paper. The goal of this research is to determine the level of use of social networks by college students in Slovakia.

40|$|Even though rural {{households}} and poultry producers are highly aware of HPAI, {{their knowledge of}} HPAI symptoms is limited and their knowledge about transmission, preventive measures, and disposal methods are variable. Important factors that affect knowledge about HPAI symptoms include education of the household head, household size, income per capita, and past HPAI experience. To ensure effective <b>communication</b> with <b>target</b> <b>audiences,</b> awareness campaigns should use training materials appropriate to the socio-demographic and economic characteristics of rural communities and poor poultry producers. Understanding people’s knowledge, attitudes, practices, and perceptions (KAPP) about and toward risk {{is an important step}} in determining which cost-effective measure to adopt. It also is important in assessing poor people’s willingness to adopt costeffective prevention and control measures for reducing the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Although studies in several countries indicate some level of awareness about HPAI, practices and attitudes for preventing and controlling HPAI disease spread and outbreaks have not changed (Fielding et al. 2005, Maton et al. 2007, DiGiuseppe et al. 2008, Leslie et al. 2008). Furthermore, various study results have shown that poor communities and poultry farmers tend to perceive the risk of contracting HPAI to be very low. If they understood the potential effects of HPAI infection on their income, wealth, and food security and which prevention and control strategies would be most costeffective, then they might be more willing to adopt such strategies. The knowledge and perceptions about and toward HPAI of poor Indonesian households are investigated by asking the following questions: What do poor communities and poultry farmers perceive about the risk of HPAI infections to them and their poultry? What do they think are the factors or drivers of disease transmission? Wha...|$|R

40|$|The aim {{and purpose}} of this essay is to study if three museums are using Facebook {{strategically}} to promote two-way <b>communication</b> with their <b>target</b> <b>audiences</b> in their external communication. A qual-itative and comparative research method and has been used and communication managers {{from each of the}} three museums have been interviewed. These interviews have been transcribed and coded in order to reveal opinions and views on how that particular museum feels about social media and the use of these tools in their external communication. A number of Facebook statuses have also been collect-ed in order to discover how each of the museums is using social media in order to reach and engage their target groups. Should the results of this essay be summarized it would show that the museums are using the communication channel that they feel suits the needs of reaching a specific audience. These channels can be a variety of newspaper ads, television or radio commercials. This kind of one-way communication does not give the audience any chance of direct feedback or the possibility to voice opinion about the message that has been sent. The social media networking sites such as Facebook have filled this gap; this is also the main argument as to why these museums are using Facebook to reach promote two-way communications with their <b>target</b> <b>audiences.</b> Because of this Facebook has earned a central place in the practice of external communication for these museums. Those responsi-ble for the internal and external communication agree that the tools used to communicate with their audiences, whether it is social media or otherwise, no tool should be considered to be “better” than the other. The tools should instead be used to complement each other, and the need of the organization should dictate the choice of communication tool not the other way around...|$|R

The station began broadcasting on 1 st January 2002 and within {{the first few years of}} its existence it proved that even in the Czech media landscape it is possible (despite its narrow profile) to build a strong rock radio station.

Drug Guides for Patients (DGPs) are created by the market authorization holders of drugs for three types of drugs, namely those with a Warning section in the package insert; those with a package insert requiring specific instructions to patients to prevent serious adverse drug reactions; and those requiring the provision of specific information to patients to ensure rational use, excluding drugs used for tests and surgeries (Pharmaceuticals and Food Safety Bureau 2005). This requirement for DGPs is similar to that for the Medication Guides prepared {{as a part of the}} US Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Systems (REMS) (The US Food and Drug Administration 2011). The DGPs were assessed according to the 10 rating criteria used in a survey of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) publications on the internet conducted by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) (The US Food and Drug Administration 2009). Items included “easy to read”, “easy to find what I need”, “organization of information”, “font and font size”, “length”, “relevance to your specialty or area of expertise”, “understandable”, “timeliness”, “helpful”, and “amount of background information”. Rating was done on 5 -point Likert scales from poor through average to excellent, with 3 as the mid-point and higher scores indicating a better result. Two items asked respondents to assess internet websites providing drug information which were operated by pharmaceutical companies themselves with regard to their usefulness for risk communications to patients and healthcare professionals. Further, respondents were also asked to choose the three most useful measures for risk communications in emergencies from among regulatory measures, including a DHCP letter and revision of the package insert; direct communication by the regulatory authority; communication by company medical representatives; publication via mass media or academic journals; and communication via company websites. They were also asked to rank these measures for effectiveness from first to third rank, with the first-ranked measure given a score of three and the third-ranked a score of one, while measures which were not selected were scored as zero. Last, we solicited opinions about disclosure of the risk management plan, for which a new local regulatory guidance had been issued (April 2012) but which had yet to be implemented at the time of survey (Pharmaceuticals and Food Safety Bureau 2012).|$|R

To effectively determine the brand's <b>target</b> <b>audience,</b> marketing managers should consider the three main general aspects of <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> grouping: demographics, psychographics and consumer lifestyle (Percy, Rossiter, & Elliott, 2001, p. 65).|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} co-creation {{as a new}} persuasive {{strategy in}} health campaigns. Co-creation enables <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> members to become active campaign producers. A recent Dutch anti-smoking campaign applied co-creation, inviting the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> to complete the slogan “smoking is sóóó... ” with something outdated on social networking sites (SNSs) like Facebook and Twitter to stress non-smoking as the new social norm. From a corpus-linguistic perspective, we investigated how the slogans from the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> resonated with or deviated from the campaign’s original message. In general, the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> slogans followed the campaign’s approach, but on the SNSs, differences were found regarding the valence, type of utterance, and domain to which smoking was compared. The <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> frequently compared smoking with other (inter) personal social norms. Co-creation thus provides the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> {{with an opportunity to}} disseminate campaign messages from their own perspective, {{but at the same time}} a co-creation strategy risks diluting the intended campaign message...|$|R

The TRP and GRP metrics are both critical components for determining the potential marketing REACH of a particular advertisement. Outside of television, TRPs are calculated using the denominator as the total <b>target</b> <b>audience,</b> and the numerator as the total impressions delivered to this audience x 100. (As in 1,000,000 impressions among the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> / 10,000,000 people in total in the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> x 100 = 10 TRPs). TRPs are often added up by week, and presented in a flowchart so a marketer can see the amount of impressions delivered to the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> from each media channel.|$|R

This part of the analysis is framed by Preben Sepstrups theories about the recipient conditions and the communication process. The methodological basis, consist of social constructivism, qualitative focus group interviews and a discourse analysis made from a critical common sense understanding.

50|$|Two key {{marketing}} {{terms are}} <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> and <b>target</b> market. Distinguishing the correct target market(s) and defining a <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> {{is a crucial}} step when owning a business. Although the two are very similar, {{it is essential to}} understand the differences.|$|R
50|$|Defining the {{difference}} between a target market and a <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> comes down to {{the difference}} between marketing and advertising. In marketing, a market is targeted by business strategies, whilst advertisements and media, such as television shows, music and print media, are more effectively used to appeal to a <b>target</b> <b>audience.</b> A potential strategy to appeal to a <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> would be advertising toys during the morning children’s TV programs, rather than during the evening news broadcast.|$|R
50|$|The review {{should take}} note of the overall target market. However, this does not {{necessarily}} mean that the advertising campaign will be directed at the total target market. Marketers and advertisers make a distinction between the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> for an advertising message and the target market for a product or brand. By definition, the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> is the intended audience for a given advertisement or message in a publication or broadcast medium, while the target market consists of all existing and potential consumers of a product, service or brand. Companies often develop different advertising messages and media strategies to reach different <b>target</b> <b>audiences.</b> For example, McDonald's Restaurants uses the anthropomorphic brand characters, Ronald McDonald and Hamburgler, in its advertising directed at children who are important brand-choice influencers. However, for adult <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> members, McDonald's uses messages that emphasise convenience and quality. Thus the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> for a given advertising message may comprise only a subset of the total market as defined in the marketing plan. Careful perusal of the marketing plan will assist marketers in the process of defining the optimal <b>target</b> <b>audiences</b> for specific advertising objectives.|$|R
