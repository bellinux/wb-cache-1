We are now off the coast of Tunis: not so high and rocky as that of Algiers, and apparently much more richly cultivated. A space of considerable length along shore, between a conical hill called Mount Baluty and Cape Bon, which we passed last night, is occupied by the French as a <b>coral</b> <b>fishery.</b> They drop heavy shot by lines on the coral rocks and break off fragments which they fish up with nets. The Algerines, seizing about 200 Neapolitans thus employed gave rise to the bombardment of their town by Lord Exmouth. All this coast is picturesquely covered with enclosures and buildings and is now clothed with squally weather. One hill has a smoky umbrella displayed over its peak, which is very like a volcano--many islets and rocks bearing the Italian names of sisters, brothers, dogs, and suchlike epithets. The view is very striking, with varying rays of light and of shade mingling and changing as the wind rises and falls. About one o'clock we pass the situation of ancient Carthage, but saw no ruins, though such are said to exist. A good deal of talk about two ancient lakes called----; I knew the name, but little more. We passed in the evening two rocky islands, or skerries, rising straight out of the water, called Gli Fratelli or The Brothers.|$|E
40|$|For over 40 yr, {{the black}} <b>coral</b> <b>fishery</b> in Hawai'i has been managed successfully. However, three new {{developments}} now threaten sustainability of the resource. First, harvesting pressure on increasingly smaller colonies of both species of commercial black coral (Antipathes dichotoma Pallas and Antipathes grandis Verrill) has increased. Since 1976, {{the biomass of}} black coral in the overall bed off Maui, Hawai'i, has decreased by about 25 %. Second, at depths between 80 and 110 m off Maui an alien species, Carijoa riisei (Duchassaing & Michelotti), has overgrown {{large areas of the}} substratum as well as many adult colonies of both species of commercial black coral. This invasion may be contributing to a decrease in the recruitment of both species of black coral at shallower depths. Third, increasing sales of black coral jewelry in recent years is also placing more demand on the resource. Taken together, these trends suggest a need for more stringent regulations, including a larger size (height) limit, a reduction in the maximum sustained yield, and possible reassessment of the economics of the fishery. Adoption of these or other measures would help to extend and ensure continued sustainability of the black <b>coral</b> <b>fishery</b> in Hawai'i and long-term conservation of the resource...|$|E

40|$|Taiwan used to {{have the}} biggest {{precious}} <b>coral</b> <b>fisheries</b> industry in the world. However, due {{to changes in the}} fishery, including increased fishing restrictions and the replacement of obsolete vessels, the scale of the industry had been gradually reduced since 1979. Unfortunately, the initiative proved to be poorly managed and resulted in an increase in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) coral fishing. This forced the government to review and amend the precious <b>coral</b> <b>fisheries</b> management regulations, which had been in place for decades. The Taiwanese government introduced stringent monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) management methods, already used in deep water fisheries, as a precautionary approach. At the same time, an investigation and evaluation of existing resources was carried out. Together, these initiatives were introduced in order to encourage the domestic industry to adopt the concept of ecosystem-based fishery management. This paper reviews the development of precious <b>coral</b> <b>fisheries</b> management in Taiwan, discusses the causes of illegal <b>coral</b> <b>fisheries</b> and looks at the reasons for adjustments to the current management system.

40|$|A recent {{shift in}} the pattern of {{commercial}} harvest in the Keppel Island region of the southern inshore Great Barrier Reef raises concern about the depletion of a number of relatively rare restricted range taxa. The shift appears to be driven by demand from the United States (US) for corals for domestic aquaria. Data from the annual status reports from the Queensland <b>Coral</b> <b>Fishery</b> were compared with export trade data to the US from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Evidence was found of recent increases in the harvest of species from the Mussidae family (Acanthastrea spp.) which appears to be largely driven by demand from the US. On present trends, the industry runs the risk of localized depletion of Blastomussa and Scolymia; evidenced by an increase in the harvest of small specimens and the trend of decreasing harvest despite a concurrent increase in demand. Considering their relatively high sediment tolerance compared to other reef-building species, and the current lack of information about their functional role in reef stability, the trend raises concerns {{about the impact of the}} harvest on local coral communities. The recent shift in harvest patterns could have impacts on slow-growing species by allowing harvest beyond the rate of population regeneration.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. Antipatharians, {{commonly}} known as black corals, are treasured by many cultures for medicinal purposes and to produce jewelry. Despite their economic and cultural importance, very {{little is known about}} the basic biology and ecology of black corals, because most species inhabit deeper-water environments (> 50 m) which are logistically challenging to study. The objectives of this dissertation were to (1) comprehensively review the literature on the biology and ecology of black corals worldwide, (2) provide a taxonomic guide to the shallow-water (< 200 m) antipatharian fauna from the Hawaiian Archipelago, and (3) examine sexual reproductive processes within Antipathes griggi, the dominant species targeted by the Hawaiian black <b>coral</b> <b>fishery.</b> The literature review reveals that despite encompassing close to 240 species that are found in diverse environments, there are a number of generalities in the biology and ecology of black corals. Most antipatharian species are found in tropical and subtropical regions below depths of 50 m, on areas with hard substrates, low-light and strong currents. Antipatharians are generally slow-growing and long-lived organisms with longevities ranging from decades to millennia. With the exception of a few predators, antipatharians appear to be little impacted by predation. Like other corals, antipatharians can be habitat engineers of importance to a myriad of associated fish and invertebrates, several of which are adapted to live exclusively on black corals. A taxonomic guide to the shallow-water (< 200 m) antipatharian fauna of the Hawaiian Archipelago was created by examining all available museum specimens from Hawaiian waters, as well as type material from species collected outside of Hawaiʻi. Based on these examinations eight species are identified from Hawaiʻi including (1) Antipathes griggi Opresko, 2009, (2) Antipathes grandis Verrill, 1928, (3) Stichopathes echinulata Brook, 1889, (4) an undescribed Stichopathes sp., (5) Cirrhipathes cf. anguina Dana, 1846, (6) Aphanipathes verticillata Brook, 1889, (7) Acanthopathes undulata (Van Pesch, 1914), and (8) Myriopathes cf. ulex (Ellis & Solander, 1786). The sexual reproduction of Antipathes griggi was investigates using histological techniques. The results indicate that A. griggi is likely gonochoric with a 1 : 1 sex-ratio, and spawns continuously between June and December when temperatures are highest. Although, A. griggi can be found to depths of 100 m, it is rare below the 75 m depth limit at which commercial harvest occurs in Hawaiʻi. Thus, the supposed depth refuge from harvest does not really exist, thereby calling into question population models used for the management of the Hawaiian black <b>coral</b> <b>fishery...</b>|$|E
40|$|In 1992, Australian Commonwealth, State, Territory {{and local}} governments {{committed}} to an ecologically sustainable development (ESD) approach {{to the use of}} natural resources. Fisheries resources were (see Green et al. 1991) and still are (see Fletcher et al. 2003) considered to be one of many specific natural resource foci that fall squarely under the ESD umbrella. Queensland's commitment to managing fishery resources under ESD principles is embedded in the Fisheries Act 1994 : 1) The main purpose of the Act is to provide for the use, conservation and enhancement of the community's fisheries resources and fish habitats in a way that seeks to - a) apply and balance the principles of ecologically sustainable development; and b) promote ecologically sustainable development. 2) In balancing the principles, each principle is to be given the relative emphasis appropriate in the circumstances. To prompt continued progress towards ESD in Australian fisheries, the Commonwealth Government introduced the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act 1999) and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Wildlife Protection Act) Act 2001. Following these legislative changes, in order to obtain export approval, fisheries management agencies must demonstrate (through ecological assessment submissions) that their fishery management regimes comply with the objectives of ecologically sustainable development. The Australian Government Department of the Environment and Heritage (DEH) is the Commonwealth Government department currently auditing the fishery management agency submissions (unless states have in place accredited alternative audit processes). All submissions must be based on and satisfy the Australian Governments 'Guidelines for the Ecologically Sustainable Management of Fisheries', which are publicly available at [URL] The guidelines cover a number of individual objectives broadly relating to impacts to target species; bycatch and byproduct species; endangered, threatened and protected (ETP) species; ecologically threatened communities; and the marine ecosystem generally.

40|$|The Mediterranean {{red coral}} (Corallium rubrum, L. 1758) is a characteristical gorgonian living in semidark {{habitats}} in the coralligenous zone of sublittoral hard bottoms. Despite being harvested commercially {{for the use}} of its red calcium carbonate skeleton in the jewelery industry, its ecology is still little understood. Thus the objective {{of this study was to}} increase knowledge on the population structure, reproduction and feeding ecology of red coral and to use these data to evaluate the efficiency of current management strategies of this species. The size/age structure of a population records valuable information, summarising the effects of mortality, recruitment and growth of past years. The six studied populations at the Costa Brava (NE Spain) consisted mainly of small/young colonies, as larger colonies are commercially exploited. Average size and age were estimated at 3 cm height and 7. 5 years, whereas the species is capable of reaching 50 cm and 100 years. Furthermore, these young populations consist of colonies that have developed only few branches, offering considerably less three dimensional structure to the ecosystem than unharvested populations. One of the studied populations is located in a protected area, the Medas Islands Marine Park, and consisted of significantly larger/older colonies, thus allowing to distinguish harvesting effects from environmental ones. The reproductive output of red coral was found to significantly depend on colony size, having important implications for its management. Another aspect of potential importance for optimal harvesting is mesoscale variation of reproductive output. In a comparison of eight stations, however, we did not find significant differences, indicatig a homogenous reproduction. Colonies in deep water were found to spawn slightly earlier than shallow water ones, however, this phenomenon was observed only when temperature stratification in summer was particularly pronounced. Yet depth was not found to affect reproductive output itself, again in contrast to the demographic features. The trophic ecology is one of the key aspects of the biology of an organism, helping to understand its demography and reproductive biology. The main proportion of the diet of Corallium rubrum was found to be particulate organic matter, while crustaceans such as copepods played a smaller role due to the irregular capture. Red coral appear to be able to meet their energy requirements by constant access of resuspended detritic material, while taking advantage of occasional capture of large zooplankters. Prey capture rate per polyp is higher in small colonies, and also in colonies situated in deep water. We did not find a clear seasonal pattern in red coral feeding, as observed in some gorgonians, which indicates that changes in water movement have a stronger effect on the prey capture rate than the seasonal succession of the plankton. The grazing impact of red coral populations was estimated to be lower than that by other gorgonians, which is a result of its population structure being dominated by small colonies. Ecological data like those presented in this study are the base for ecosystem management, as they allow to calculate the secondary production of a population. We therefore used the demography and reproduction data to provide managment recommendations for red coral, by using the Beverton-Holt fishery management model to calculate maximum sustainable yield. The results show that the red <b>coral</b> <b>fishery</b> at the Costa Brava would reach its maximum yield only at a considerable age of first capture, whereas the colonies are harvested at a much younger age. This results in an estimated annual catch that is only a fraction of what could be harvested using an optimised management strategy. Furthermore, harvesting at this age provides a short reproductive period before capture, compared for example to the sustainable fishery of black coral in Hawaii. The comparison of calculated and declared harvests indicates considerable poaching activities and undeclared harvest. Finally, a recent rise in mortality confirms a non-sustainable level of harvesting. Concluding, the results confirm the paramount importance of data on the reproductive biology and population structure of a species for its management. In this study we investigated the effects of harvesting, spacial mesoscale variability and depth on the population structure, reproduction and feeding ecology of red coral. The data show that red coral populations at the Costa Brava are very young and have a diminished reproductive potential due to overharvesting, yet show a considerable impact on the seston. Protecting young colonies is proposed as the central management measure...|$|E

40|$|SummaryOverexploitation {{is one of}} the {{principal}} threats to coral reef diversity, structure, function, and resilience [1, 2]. Although it is generally held that <b>coral</b> reef <b>fisheries</b> are unsustainable [3 – 5], little is known of the overall scale of exploitation or which reefs are overfished [6]. Here, on the basis of ecological footprints and a review of exploitation status [7, 8], we report widespread unsustainability of island <b>coral</b> reef <b>fisheries.</b> Over half (55 %) of the 49 island countries considered are exploiting their <b>coral</b> reef <b>fisheries</b> in an unsustainable way. We estimate that total landings of <b>coral</b> reef <b>fisheries</b> are currently 64 % higher than can be sustained. Consequently, the area of coral reef appropriated by fisheries exceeds the available effective area by ∼ 75, 000 km 2, or 3. 7 times the area of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, and an extra 196, 000 km 2 of coral reef may be required by 2050 to support the anticipated growth in human populations. The large overall imbalance between current and sustainable catches implies that management methods to reduce social and economic dependence on reef fisheries are essential to prevent the collapse of coral reef ecosystems while sustaining the well-being of burgeoning coastal populations...|$|R
