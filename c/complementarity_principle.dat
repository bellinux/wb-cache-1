40|$|Recently, multi-view {{representation}} {{learning has}} become a rapidly growing direction in machine learning and data mining areas. This paper introduces several principles for multi-view representation learning: correlation, consensus, and <b>complementarity</b> <b>principles.</b> Consequently, we first review the representative methods and theories of multi-view representation learning based on correlation principle, especially on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its several extensions. Then {{from the viewpoint of}} consensus and <b>complementarity</b> <b>principles</b> we investigate the advancement of multi-view representation learning that ranges from shallow methods including multi-modal topic learning, multi-view sparse coding, and multi-view latent space Markov networks, to deep methods including multi-modal restricted Boltzmann machines, multi-modal autoencoders, and multi-modal recurrent neural networks. Further, we also provide an important perspective from manifold alignment for multi-view representation learning. Overall, this survey aims to provide an insightful overview of theoretical basis and state-of-the-art developments in the field of multi-view representation learning and to help researchers find the most appropriate tools for particular applications.

All {{this work was}} focussed on "frames", i. e., on fixed, static, local descriptions of the system behaviour. In this paper we are mainly interested in the asymptotical description of complementarity. To this aim we will study the asymptotical behaviour of two <b>complementarity</b> <b>principles</b> by associating to every incomplete deterministic automaton (with outputs, but no initial state) certain sofic shifts: automata having the same behaviour correspond to a unique sofic shift. In this way, a class of sofic shifts reflecting complementarity will be introduced and studied.

2500|$|According to the <b>complementarity</b> <b>principle,</b> a photon can {{manifest}} {{properties of}} a particle or of a wave, but not {{both at the}} same time. What characteristic is manifested depends on whether experimenters use a device intended to observe particles or to observe waves. When this statement is applied very strictly, one could argue that by determining the detector type one could force the photon to become manifest only as a particle or only as a wave. Detection of a photon is a destructive process because a photon can never be seen in flight. When a photon is detected it [...] "appears" [...] in the consequences of its demise, e.g., by being absorbed by an electron in a photomultiplier that accepts its energy which is then used to trigger the cascade of events that produces a [...] "click" [...] from that device. A photon always appears at some highly localized point in space and time. In the apparatuses that detect photons, the locations on its detection screen that indicate reception of the photon give an indication of {{whether or not it was}} manifesting its wave nature during its flight from photon source to the detection device. Therefore, it is commonly said that in a double-slit experiment a photon exhibits its wave nature when it passes through both of the slits and appears as a dim wash of illumination across the detection screen, and manifests its particle nature when it passes through only one slit and appears on the screen as a highly localized scintillation.|$|E

40|$|Mermin [15] {{described}} a simple device to explain Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) [12] correlations. This device was studied {{by means of}} a class of probabilistic (Mermin) automata in [4]. In [5] one shows that every deterministic automaton simulating with confidence 1 / 2 a probabilistic Mermin automaton features a classical behaviour. Is the above result true when the simulation is done at higher levels of confidence? To answer this question we study the distribution of two computational <b>complementarity</b> <b>principles</b> for two classes of deterministic automata which mimic the behaviour of Mermin's device with confidence in the intervals (1 / 2, 11 / 16) and (11 / 16, 7 / 8).

40|$|The main {{principle}} of the economic approach to a trophic system we propose here lies in assuming {{that there is a}} transfer of food along a path between a prey and a predator if, for the predator, the benefits are greater than costs of predation on this path. Conversely, if the costs exceed the benefits, there are no flows. This trade-off, considered all along the food chains of an ecosystem, together with ecological processes (assimilation, somatic maintenance) results in a model coupling mass balance equations (biological constraints) and <b>complementarity</b> <b>principles</b> (Walras' law). Here is the core of the Network Economics Approach to Trophic Systems (NEATS). We illustrate with simple examples of ecosystems how these principles result in algebraic equations which can be analyzed mathematically and solved numerically. We show, in a more sophisticated example of an input/output trophic network, that they result in "affine variational inequalities", whose solutions can be estimated. We make explicit how the approach can be applied to address ecological questions, concerning differences of productivity, causes of biological diversity, or the nature of controls in marine ecosystems...|$|R

The low entropy starting point is the ultimate reason that the universe has an arrow of time, without which the second law would not make sense. However, there is no universally accepted explanation of how the universe got into such a special state.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Thesis is to study, from the {{mathematical}} point of view, {{a new type of}} questions about finite automata, questions motivated by looking at automata as toy models of physical particles. Working along the line of research initiated by Moore, two computational <b>complementarity</b> <b>principles</b> are studied, (for finite-deterministic, complete or incomplete, nondeterministic-automata with outputs but no initial states) both theoretically and experimentally; they mimic the physical complementarity and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect. Automata are studied via simulations (informally, the automaton A is simulated by the automaton B if B can perform all computations A can execute and produces the same outputs; two automata are equivalent in case they simulate each other). A new type of minimization problem will be solved and the solution is proved to be unique up to an isomorphism; the minimal automaton equivalent to a given automaton can be constructed only in terms of outputs for deterministic complete or incomplete automata, but one needs the whole internal machinery for nondeterministic automata. It happens that minimal automata are exactly the automata which may feature computational complementarity. Even if the original motivation will remain only metaphorical, the physical motivation was good to suggest new definitions and constructions (simulation, universality, complementarity) leading to new mathematical results (existence of universal finite automaton, solving in a new way the minimalization problem for nondeterministic automata) ...|$|R

40|$|Trace element (TE) {{contaminated}} land represents an important {{risk to the}} environment and to human health worldwide. These soils usually contain a variety of TEs which can be a challenge for plant-based remediation options. As individual plant species often possess a limited range of TE remediation abilities, functional <b>complementarity</b> <b>principles</b> could be of value for remediation of soil contaminated by multiple TEs using assemblages of species. Monocultures and polycultures of Festuca arundinacea, Medicago sativa and Salix miyabeana were grown for 4 months in aged-polluted soil contaminated by Ag, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Se and Zn. Above and belowground biomass yields, root surface area (RSA) and TE tissue concentrations were recorded. In monoculture, the greatest aboveground biomass was produced by S. miyabeana (S), the greatest belowground biomass was from M. sativa (M) and F. arundinacea (F) produced the highest RSA. The polycultures of F+M, F+S and F+M+S produced among the highest values across all three traits. F. arundinacea monoculture and its combination with S. miyabeana (F+S) accumulated the highest amounts of total TEs in belowground tissues, whereas the most effective combination (or monoculture) for aboveground extraction yields varied depending on the TE considered. The crops demonstrated complementarity in their biomass allocation patterns as well as facilitative interactions. When considering contamination with a particular TE, the best phytomanagement approach could include a specific monoculture option; however, when above and belowground biomass allocation patterns, TE-remediation abilities as well as nitrogen accessibility are considered, co-cropping all three species (F+M+S) was the most robust scenario for remediation of multiple-TE {{contaminated land}}. By more effectively addressing a diversity of TE, species assemblage approaches could represent an important advancement towards enabling the use of plants to address contaminated-land issues worldwide...|$|R
