2500|$|A month later, LaRouche held a {{press conference}} to accuse the Soviet government, British government, drug dealers, {{international}} bankers, and journalists of being involved in a variety of conspiracies. Flanked by bodyguards, he said, [...] "If Abe Lincoln were alive, he'd probably be standing up here with me today," [...] {{and that there was no}} criticism of him that did not originate [...] "with the drug lobby or the Soviet operation ..." [...] He said he had been in danger from Soviet assassins for over 13 years, and had to live in safe houses. He refused to answer a question from an NBC reporter, saying [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> with a drug pusher like you?" [...] He called the leadership of the United States [...] "idiotic" [...] and [...] "berserk," [...] and its foreign policy [...] "criminal or insane." [...] He warned of the imminent collapse of the banking system and accused banks of laundering drug money. Asked about the movement's finances, he said [...] "I don't know. ... I'm not responsible, I'm not involved in that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{results of}} the {{thousands}} of teeth analyzed, published in the November 24, 1961, issue of the journal Science, revealed elevated levels of radioactive compounds in the first sets of teeth that had been collected. President John F. Kennedy was made aware of the research results while he was negotiating a treaty with the United Kingdom and Soviet Union to place controls on nuclear testing. His call to the Reiss home was answered by her son; the person {{on the other end of}} the phone said, [...] "This is John Kennedy, <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> to your mom?" [...] Further analysis by the team led to the conclusion that children born in 1963 had absorbed levels of strontium-90 that were 50 times higher than those found in children born a decade earlier. Her husband, Eric Reiss, testified before the United States Senate when it was considering ratification of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Later research showed that levels of strontium-90 in the cohort born in 1968, after the treaty had gone into effect, had declined by 50 percent.|$|E

If I go among gentlemen, <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> to them? If they {{have anything to say}} about a railway, they will ask me a question: if they speak to me beyond that, I must be dumb. If I go among my workmen, can they talk to me? No; I am their master, and a stern master. They bob their heads and shake in their shoes when they see me. Where are my friends? Here!" [...] said he, and he dragged a bottle from under his very pillow. [...] "Where are my amusements? Here!" [...] and he brandished the bottle almost in the doctor's face. [...] "Where is my one resource, my one gratification, my only comfort after all my toils. Here, doctor; here, here, here!" [...] and, so saying, he replaced his treasure beneath his pillow.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must own, sir," [...] she resumed, [...] "that he behaves {{a little}} ungratefully--even to strangers who take an {{interest}} in him. When he gets lost in the streets (which is very often), he sits down on the pavement and howls till he collects a pitying crowd round him; and when they try to read his name and address on his collar he snaps at them. The servants generally find him and bring him back; {{and as soon as he}} gets home he turns round on the doorstep and snaps at the servants. I think it must be his fun. You should see him sitting up in his chair at dinner-time, waiting to be helped, with his fore paws on the edge of the table, like the hands of a gentleman at a public dinner making a speech. But, oh!" [...] cried Isabel, checking herself, with the tears in her eyes, [...] "how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> of him in this way when he is so dreadfully ill! Some of them say it's bronchitis, and some say it's his liver. Only yesterday I took him to the front door to give him a little air, and he stood still on the pavement, quite stupefied. For the first time in his life, he snapped at nobody who went by; and, oh, dear, he hadn't even the heart to smell a lamp-post!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He was vague himself, and evidently weak, {{and much}} embarrassed, {{and not an}} allusion was made between us to Mansfield Street. The vision of the salon {{of which he had}} been an {{ornament}} hovered before me however, by contrast, sufficiently. He assured me he was really getting better, and his mother remarked that he would come round if he could only get his spirits up. The aunt echoed this opinion, and I became more sure that in her own case she knew where to go for such a purpose. I'm afraid I was rather weak with my old friend, for I neglected the opportunity, so exceptionally good, to rebuke the levity which had led him to throw up honourable positions--fine stiff steady berths in Bayswater and Belgravia, with morning prayers, as I knew, attached to one of them. Very likely his reasons had been profane and sentimental; he didn't want morning prayers, he wanted to be somebody's dear fellow; but I couldn't be the person to rebuke him. He shuffled these episodes out of sight--I saw he had no wish to discuss them. I noted further, strangely enough, that it would probably be a questionable pleasure for him to see me again: he doubted now even of my power to condone his aberrations. He didn't wish to have to explain; and his behaviour was likely in future to need explanation. When I bade him farewell he looked at me a moment with eyes that said everything: [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> about those exquisite years in this place, before these people, with the old women poking their heads in? It was very good of you to come to see me; it wasn't my idea--SHE brought you. We've said everything; it's over; you'll lose all patience with me, and I'd rather you shouldn't see the rest." [...] I sent him some money in a letter the next day, but I saw the rest only in the light of a barren sequel.|$|E

60|$|The {{worst of}} such predicaments is, my dear Charles, {{that when one}} does write, {{everything}} one has, at a thousand scattered moments, previously wanted to say, seems to have dried up with desuetude and neglect. Oh, {{all the things that}} should have been said on the spot if they were ever to be said at all! This applies, you will immediately recognise--though it's a stern truth by which I suffer most--very poignantly to all the utterance I feel myself to have so odiously failed of {{at the time of the}} death of dear Burne-Jones. I can only give you a very partially lucid account of why on that occasion at least no word from me reached you. I saw myself, heard myself, felt myself, not write--and yet even then knew perfectly both that I should be writing now and that I should now be sorrier than ever for not writing then. It came, the miserable event, at the very moment I was achieving, very single-handed and unassisted, a complicated transfer of residence from London to this place, with all sorts of bewildering material detail (consequent on renovation, complete preparation of every kind, of old house and garden) adding its distraction to the acute sense of pressing work fatally retarded and blighted; so that a postponement which has finally grown to this monstrous length began with being a thing only of moments and hours. Then, moreover, it was simply so wretched and odious to feel him, by a turn of the wheel of fate that had taken but an instant, gone for ever from sight and sound and touch. I was tenderly attached to him, with abundant reason for being, and there was something that choked and angered me beyond what words could trust themselves to express, in the mere blind bêtise of the business. So the days and the weeks went. I went up from here to town, and thence to Rottingdean, for the committal of his ashes, there, to the earth of the little grey-towered churchyard, in sight of the sea, that was at the moment all smothered in lovely spring flowers. It was a day of extraordinary beauty, and in every way a quite indescribably sincere--I remember I could find at the time no other word for the impression--little funeral and demonstration. The people from London were those, almost all, in whose presence there was a kind of harmony.... I had seen the dear man, to my great joy, only a few hours before his death: meeting him at a kind of blighted and abortive wedding-feast (that is a dinner before a marriage that was to take place on the morrow) from which we were both glad to disembroil ourselves: so that we drove together home, intimately moralising and talking nonsense, and he put me, in the grey London midnight, down at my corner to go on by himself to the Grange. It was the last time I saw him, and, as one always does, I have taken ever since a pale comfort in the thought that our parting was explicitly affectionate and such, almost, as one would have wished it even had one known. I miss him even here and now. He was one of the most loveable of men and most charming of friends--altogether and absolutely distinguished. I think his career, as an artistic one, and speaking quite apart from the degree of one's sympathy with his work, one of the greatest of boons to our most vulgar of ages. There was no false note in him, nothing to dilute the strain; he knew his direction and held it hard--wrought with passion and went as straight as he could. He was for all this always, to me, a great comfort. For the rest death came to him, I think, at none so bad a moment. He had, essentially, to my vision, really done. And he was very tired, and his cup was, with all the mingled things, about as full as it would hold. It was so good a moment, in short, that I think his memory is already feeling the benefit of it in a sort of rounded finished way. I was not at the sale of his pictures and drawings which took place after his death--I have not stirred from this spot since I came to it at the end of June; but though I should immensely have cherished some small scrap, everything went at prices--magnificent for his estate--that made acquisition a vain dream.... I have had--and little wonder--scant news of you. I know you've renounced your professorship. I know you felt strongly on public events. But I am in a depressed twilight--of discrimination, I mean--that enables me to make less of these things than I should like to do. So much has come and gone, these six months, that how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> about it? It's strange, the consciousness possible to an American here to-day, of being in a country in which the drift of desire--so far as it concerns itself with the matter--is that we shall swell and swell, and acquire and require, to the top of our opportunity. My own feeling, roughly stated, is that we have not been good enough for our opportunity--vulgar, in a manner, as that was and is; but it may be the real message of the whole business to make us as much better as the great grabbed-up British Empire has, unmistakeably, made the English. But over these abysses--into them rather--I peer with averted eye. I fear I am too lost in the mere spectacle for any decent morality. Good-bye, my dear Charles, and forgive my mechanic volubility. Isn't it better to have ticked and shocked than never to have ticked at all? I send my love to all your house....|$|E
