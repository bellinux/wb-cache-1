The reason a spacer GIF is invisible is so that an HTML developer can create a table cell and fill the background with a specific color that can be viewed through the transparent spacer GIF. For instance, a developer seeking to create a square blue box 500 pixels on a side could use a separate blue 500×500 graphic at the expense of additional bandwidth. Instead, the developer can specify the table cell background color and specify the dimensions of a pre-existing transparent spacer GIF.|$|E

40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} microRNA 150 (miR- 150) up-regulation on proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC 7721, and the potential mechanism thereof. Methods　The SMMC 7721 cells were divided into miR- 150 modulated group, negative <b>control</b> group, and <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> group. Chemically synthesized hsa-miR- 150, according to the maturity sequence of hsa-miR- 150, was inserted into pGIPZ vector. SMMC 7721 cells in miR- 150 modulated group and negative control were transfected with miR- 150 pGIPZ and miR-control respectively, while those in <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> group without transfection. The expression of miR- 150 was determined by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. The cell proliferation ability was determined by Cell Counting Kit- 8 (CCK- 8) assay, and cell apoptosis was assayed by flow cytometry. The protein expression of c-Myb was measured by Western blotting. Results　The miR- 150 expression increased by 7 folds in cells after being transfected with miR- 150 than those in negative <b>control</b> group and <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> group. CCK- 8 assay showed that the cellular growth rate of SMMC 7721 cells in miR- 150 pGIPZ group was significantly lower than those in negative <b>control</b> group and <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> group (P < 0. 05). The apoptotic rate in miR- 150 pGIPZ group, negative <b>control</b> group and <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> group was (19. 36 ± 1. 78) %, (5. 12 ± 0. 54) % and (4. 68 ± 0. 35) %, respectively. The expression level of c-Myb protein in negative <b>control</b> group, <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> group and miR- 150 pGIPZ group was 0. 31 ± 0. 07, 0. 80 ± 0. 09 and 0. 81 ± 0. 08, respectively. Conclusion　The results indicate that up-regulation of miR- 150 may suppress the cellular proliferation and induce cell apoptosis in SMMC 7721 cells, at least in part, through regulating the expression level of target gene c-Myb, thus implying that miR- 150 might serve as a novel molecular target for treatment of HCC...|$|R
40|$|Batch {{sorption}} {{experiments were}} carried out with the bacteriophages MS 2 and fX 174. Two types of reactor vessels, polypropylene and glass, were used. Consistently lower concentrations of MS 2 {{were found in the}} liquid phase in the absence of soil (<b>control</b> <b>blanks)</b> than in the presence of soil after mixing. High levels of MS 2 inactivation (; 99. 9 %) were observed in control tubes made of polypropylene (PP), with comparatively little loss of virus seen in PP tubes when soil was present. Minimal inactivation of MS 2 was observed when the air-water interface was completely eliminated from PP <b>control</b> <b>blanks</b> during mixing. All batch experiments performed with reactor tubes made of glass demonstrated no substantial inactivation of MS 2. In similar experiments, bacteriophage fX 174 did not undergo inactivation in either PP or glass <b>control</b> <b>blanks,</b> implying that this virus is not affected by the same factors which led to inactivation of MS 2 in the PP control tubes. When possible, phage adsorption to soil was calculated by the Freundlich isotherm. Our data suggest that forces associated with the air-water-solid interface (where the solid is a hydrophobic surface) are responsible for inactivation of MS 2 in the PP control tubes. The influence of air-water interfacial forces should be carefully considered when batch sorption experiments are conducted with certain viruses. Application of wastewater effluents to land for treatment purposes must take into consideration the potential for groundwater pollution due to virus transport through the sub-surface. A number of studies have clearly documented the ability of viruses to migrate significant distances through soil, resulting in groundwater contamination (16, 21, 41). One of the major factors limiting virus transport is sorption to soil particles (14, 46). The factors which influence virus sorption t...|$|R

This study aimed to investigate the effects of NGF on angiogenesis and skeletal muscle fiber remodeling in a murine model of hindlimb ischemia and study the relationship between NGF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in angiogenesis. Methods: Twenty-four mice were randomly allocated to normal control group (n = 6), <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> group (n = 6), VEGF gene transfection group (n = 6), and NGF gene transfection group (n = 6). The model of left hindlimb ischemia model was established by ligating the femoral artery. VEGF 165 plasmid (125 μg) and NGF plasmid (125 μg) was injected into the ischemic gastrocnemius of mice from VEGF group and NGF group, respectively. Left hindlimb function and ischemic damage were assessed with terminal points at 21 th day postischemia induction. The gastrocnemius of four groups was tested by hematoxylin-eosin staining, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and CD 34 immunohistochemistry staining, and myosin ATPase staining. NGF and VEGF protein expression was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: On the 21 th day after surgery, the functional assessment score and skeletal muscle atrophy degree of VEGF group and NGF group were significantly lower than those of normal <b>control</b> group and <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> group. The endothelial cell proliferation index and the capillary density of VEGF group and NGF group were significantly increased compared with normal <b>control</b> group and <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> group (P 0. 05).

However, the GDA-Ag was very effective and its antimicrobial efficacy ranged from 99. 90 to 99. 99 % against {{the same set of}} microbial strains except for C. albicans where it was 95. 50 %. The durability of the Ag bonded to the terminal alkynyl groups was studied by placing the GDA-Ag in PBS buffer solution (pH 7. 4) for two weeks. Initially, the silver release was relatively fast, with 40. 05 ppb of silver released in first 24 h followed by a very slow and constant release. To study the potential of GDA-Ag for medical applications, in vitro cytotoxicity of GDA-Ag against Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK 293) cell lines was studied using WST-assay. The cytotoxicity of the GDA-Ag was very low (5 %) and was almost comparable to the <b>control</b> (<b>blank</b> glass disc) indicating that GDA-Ag has a promising potential for medical applications...|$|E
30|$|To {{test the}} {{reliability}} and validity of OKS/pFind 1 strategy, we used a reporter cell line Oct 4 -GFP MEFs harboring a stably integrated green fluorescent protein (GFP) cassette driven by an Oct 4 promoter and enhancer to monitor iPSC generation. iPSC clones derived from OKS alone or OKS + pFind 1 (Fig.  1 E) showed similar morphology. We next estimated whether the addition of pFind 1 affected reprogramming efficiency. As a positive control, we supplied Brg 1 /Baf 155 chromatin remodeling complex proteins that had previously been reported to increase the number of GFP+ colonies up to 4 -fold (Singhal et al., 2010). An empty vector was used as a <b>blank</b> <b>control.</b> On these <b>blank</b> <b>control</b> plates, colonies first appeared around 10 days post transfection (dpt). In contrast, iPSC colonies appeared a few days earlier in the experiment plates that were transfected with OKS, pFind 1 and pCAG-PBase. When GFP+ colonies were counted at 14 dpt, we found that pFind 1 exhibited a clear increase in reprogramming efficiency (Fig.  1 F).|$|R
40|$|The {{medicinal}} {{properties of}} a plant are attributed {{to the presence of}} non-nutritive phytochemicals, the secondary metabolites. The extracts of the dried powder of the pericarp of fruits of Terminalia chebula Retz obtained using petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl alcohol and water in succession were tested along with positive <b>controls</b> and <b>blanks</b> for the presence of tannins, alkaloids steroids, triterpenoids, flavonoids, hydroxyanthraquinones, cardiac glycosides, saponins, and for carbohydrates (glucose and fructose), proteins, amino acids, and fixed oils & fatty acid. The results suggest the presence of diverse active phytochemicals having selective solubility in solvents of varying polarities used in succession. However, the tests for proteins, cardiac glycosides and fixed oils and fats were negative in all the extracts. The use of positive <b>control</b> and <b>blank,</b> a first approach in such studies provided unbiased accuracy in grading the intensity of the reaction. The selective solubility in solvents of varying polarities may probably is responsible in conferring a wide spectrum of biological activities attributed to the fruits of this medicinal plant. In addition the data suggest tha...|$|R
