When a vehicle drove over the grenade, it cracked a <b>chemical</b> <b>igniter</b> and leaked acid onto a sensitive chemical, which detonated the explosive. Multiple grenades were often used to destroy tanks or disable their tracks, and the grenade {{could also be used}} as a demolition charge. It was used by the British Army and the United States Army, with the former using it until 1955 and the latter also creating their own variant, the M7 anti-tank mine.|$|E
2500|$|The grenade was {{rectangular}} {{in shape}} and approximately [...] in length and [...] in width, and weighed about [...] Its explosive content consisted of around [...] of blasting explosive, which was usually either ammonal or TNT. On {{the top of the}} grenade was a plate, under which the user would insert a <b>chemical</b> <b>igniter,</b> which would act as the weapon's fuse. When a vehicle drove over the grenade, its weight crushed the plate, which in turn cracked the igniter; this then leaked acid onto a sensitive chemical which detonated the charge. The grenade was designed so that it could either be thrown at a vehicle like an ordinary anti-tank grenade, or placed at a location when used as an anti-tank mine. It was also fitted with areas where blasting caps or cordtex could be placed, so that it {{could be used as a}} demolition charge. When the grenade was used, it was recommended that the user be within a short distance of their target, ideally concealed within a trench; if the target were an armoured vehicle, then the best areas to target were the sides and rear, where the engine compartment was located and armour was generally thinner.|$|E
5000|$|Sandia's {{chemical}} and materials analysis group, headed by James Borders, investigated further the theory about a <b>chemical</b> <b>igniter.</b> Navy technicians {{stated that the}} discovery under the center gun's projectile's rotating band of minute steel-wool fibers that were encrusted with calcium and chlorine, a fragment of polyethylene terephthalate (commonly used in plastic bags), and different glycols, including brake fluid, hypochlorite, antifreeze, and Brylcreem together indicated {{the use of a}} <b>chemical</b> <b>igniter.</b> The Navy was unable to locate the steel-wool fiber evidence for Borders to examine. No untouched portions of the rotating band remained and Sandia was provided with a section to examine that had already been examined by the FBI. Borders' team examined the rotating band and did not find any traces of polyethylene terephthalate. The team found that the glycols present actually came from the Break-Free cleaning solution which had been dumped into the center gun's barrel to help free the projectile after the explosion. The team also found that calcium and chlorine were present in Iowas other gun turrets and in the gun turrets of the other Iowa-class battleships, and that this was indicative of routine exposure to a maritime environment. Borders concluded that ordinary sources accounted for all of the [...] "foreign materials" [...] found by the Navy on the center gun projectile, and that the theory that a <b>chemical</b> <b>igniter</b> had been used to cause the explosion was extremely doubtful.|$|E

40|$|Ignition of a nominal- 125 -pound-thrust cold (2000 R) gaseous-hydrogen - liquid-oxygen rocket {{combustor}} with {{chlorine trifluoride}} (hypergolic with hydrogen) and triethylaluminum (hypergolic with oxygen) resulted in consistently smooth starting transients {{for a wide}} range of combustor operating conditions. The combustor exhaust nozzle discharged into air at ambient conditions. Each starting transient consisted of the following sequence of events: injection of the lead main propellant, injection of the <b>igniter</b> <b>chemical,</b> ignition of these two chemicals, injection of the second main propellant, ignition of the two main propellants, increase in chamber pressure to its terminal value, and cutoff of igniter-chemical flow. Smooth ignition was obtained with an ignition delay of less than 100 milliseconds for the reaction of the lead propellant with the <b>igniter</b> <b>chemical</b> using approximately 0. 5 cubic inch (0 - 038 lb) of chlorine trifluoride or 1. 0 cubic inch (0 - 031 lb) of triethylaluminum. These quantities of <b>igniter</b> <b>chemical</b> were sufficient to ignite a 20 -percent-fuel hydrogen-oxygen mixture with a delay time of less than 15 milliseconds. Test results indicated that a simple, light weight chemical ignition system for hydrogen-oxygen rocket engines may be possible...|$|R
40|$|Ignitability of DMSO vapors {{have been}} {{evaluated}} at 664 mm Hg pressure. The minimum temperature at which the DMSO vapors that are in equilibrium with liquid DMSO has been determined using two types of strong ignition sources. This temperature is 172 F for <b>chemical</b> <b>igniters,</b> and 178 F for spark ignition. Numerous tests have been conducted using controlled intensity sparks to define {{the shape of the}} minimum ignition energy curve as a function of temperature. The ignition energies spanned four orders of magnitude (approximately from 20, 000 to 2 mJ) while the DMSO vapor mixture temperature varied from 185 to 207 F. The Sandia Generator was used to simulate worst case electrostatic sparks that can be produced by the human body. Although it was not designed for air discharges, this device had been used by LLNL for 1 mm spark gap and the resultant spark energy had been measured to fall within the range from 3. 2 to 8. 8 mJ. CRC tests using this device showed that the minimum ignition temperature strongly depends on the spark gap. The minimum ignition temperature was 207 F at 1 mm spark gap, 203 F at 3 mm spark gap, and 197 F at 6 mm spark gap. This strong dependence on the spark gap is believed to be partly due to the changes in the spark energy as the spark gap changes...|$|R
5000|$|The {{improved}} {{version was}} {{fitted with a}} <b>chemical</b> <b>igniter</b> which consisted of two liquids in two separated containers. When stepped over, these containers would break and the mixing of the two liquids would trigger the main explosive charge (around 200gr of TNT, [...] "type 28"). Another variant consisted of a liquid and a powder preigniter. Due to these arrangements, the mines were dangerous to transport and to lay in the field.|$|E
50|$|It was {{rectangular}} in shape, about 150 mm {{in length}} and 75 mm in width, and contained approximately 0.45 kg of explosive.

5000|$|Donnell, on 28 July, {{endorsed}} Milligan's report, {{saying that}} the determination that Hartwig had sabotaged the gun [...] "leaves the reader incredulous, yet the opinion is supported by facts and analysis from which it flows logically and inevitably". Donnell's superior, Atlantic Fleet Commander Admiral Powell F. Carter, Jr., then endorsed the report, adding that the report showed that there were [...] "substantial and serious failures by Moosally and Morse", and forwarded the report to the CNO, Carlisle Trost. Although Miceli had just announced that test results at Dahlgren showed that an electronic timer had not caused the explosion, Trost endorsed the report on 31 August, stating that Hartwig was [...] "the individual who had motive, knowledge, and physical position within the turret gun room to place a device in the powder train". Trost's endorsement cited Smith's statement to the NIS as further evidence that Hartwig was the culprit. Milligan's report was not changed to reflect Miceli's new theory that a <b>chemical</b> <b>igniter,</b> not an electrical timer, {{had been used to}} initiate the explosion.|$|E
40|$|The {{fires and}} explosions caused by {{flammable}} hydrocarbon air mixtures {{are a major}} safety concern in the chemical and processing industries. The thermo-physical and chemical properties of the flammable fuels in a hybrid form {{appear to have a}} significant impact on the combustion process. This usually occurs due to substantial changes in the flammability concentration regimes. The aim of this study is to investigate the fire and explosive properties of hybrid fuels in the chemical and process industries. In addition, it examines the impact of the ignition energy and vessel geometry on the magnitude of the pressure rise and flame propagation velocity. The experimental work was conducted on a cylindrically shaped explosion chamber constructed as part of this study at The University of Newcastle, Australia. The chamber was made of mild steel and was 30 m in length and 0. 5 in diameter. It included a series of high resolution pressure transducers, a pyrometer, as well as a high speed video camera. Methane and coal dust were used as fuels and <b>chemical</b> <b>igniters</b> with a known energy were used to ignite the fuels. The results obtained from this study showed that both the ignition energy and the diluted combustible fuel dust have significant impacts on the Over Pressure Rise (OPR) in an explosion chamber. The significant findings included that the OPR doubled when 30 g m- 3 of coal dust was added to a 6 % methane/air mixture, and it increased by 60 % when 10 kJ was used instead of a 1 kJ ignition source. The initial ignition energy was observed to considerably enhance the speed of both the pressure wave and the flame front, where the pressure wave speed doubled when using a 5 kJ instead of a 1 kJ ignition source. However, the pressure wave speed increased by five times when a 10 kJ was used instead of a 1 kJ ignition source. Additionally, the maximum flame front velocity observed for the ignition source with 5 kJ energy was twice the flame front velocity for the 1 kJ ignition source. Finally, it was observed that the time needed for the initial methane ignition was reduced by about 50 % when using a 10 kJ instead of a 1 kJ ignition source...|$|R

40|$|It's {{been almost}} 70 {{years since the}} end of the worst {{military}} conflict of all times, the World War II, during which millions of people died. It is a sad fact that it still causes casualties even today. The problem lies in thousands of different pieces of munitions located throughout Europe. The biggest problem is posed by unexploded aerial bombs that have in recent years took its toll on bomb disposal experts as well as other people. The problem of aerial bombs are mainly American and British origin, which bear long-term mechanical - <b>chemical</b> <b>igniter.</b> The design of these igniters does not allow their simple unscrewing from the body itself, and even the handling of these aerial bombs may cause its explosion and the threat to all persons located in its vicinity. Even in our country can be found these air bombs with this type of igniter. This thesis deals with the possibilities of such a disposal with regard to economic and technological possibilities of the Czech Police bomb disposal experts. Therefore, research was conducted with a focus on how best to dispose of aerial bombs. Bomb disposal experts were approached to give their professional opinions. A part of the research was the study of foreign literature dealing with this issue. The sad fact is that this problem is not satisfactorily resolved anywhere in Europe. Abroad, various methods were used as appropriate, such as using high pressure water cutting or blasting the use of special keys. As demonstrated by accident in 2010 when in German Göttingen three bomb disposal experts died in liquidation of aerial bombs using high-pressure cutting, this method and similar have proven to be inappropriate. The preparation of these special methods takes an excessively long time, and in many cases the bomb requires manipulation. Bomb disposal experts of the Czech Republic along with other experts are developing and improving the explosive separation method using a special explosive (ammunition). The most appropriate seems the use of long flexible bomb explosive: RAZOR made by a Czech company - VÚPCH Pardubice - Semtín. The explosive is attached to the body of the bomb either on its perimeter or in the axis of the bomb and this leads to the separation of the lighter or pull out the body of the lighter without explosion of the body of the bomb. Practical experience shows that the use of this special method can reduce time to prepare bomb disposal and the handling of the bomb is minimal or none. Unfortunately, there is always a risk that there will be accidental explosion of aerial bombs and therefore is imperative to comply with all safety measures to the maximum extent possible...|$|E
