50|$|The Van Deemter {{equation}} in chromatography {{relates the}} variance {{per unit length}} of a separation column to the linear mobile phase velocity by considering physical, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties of a separation. These properties include pathways within the column, diffusion (axial and longitudinal), and mass transfer kinetics between stationary and mobile phases. In liquid chromatography, the mobile phase velocity is taken as the exit velocity, that is, {{the ratio of the}} flow rate in ml/second to the cross-sectional area of the ‘column-exit flow path.’ For a packed column, the cross-sectional area of the column exit flow path is usually taken as 0.6 times the cross-sectional area of the column. Alternatively, the linear velocity can be taken as the ratio of the <b>column</b> <b>length</b> to the dead time. If the mobile phase is a gas, then the pressure correction must be applied. The variance per unit length of the column is taken as the ratio of the <b>column</b> <b>length</b> to the column efficiency in theoretical plates. The Van Deemter equation is a hyperbolic function that predicts that there is an optimum velocity at which there will be the minimum variance per unit <b>column</b> <b>length</b> and, thence, a maximum efficiency. The Van Deemter equation {{was the result of the}} first application of rate theory to the chromatography elution process.|$|E

50|$|The {{choice of}} column {{depends on the}} sample and the active measured. The main {{chemical}} attribute regarded when choosing a column is the polarity of the mixture, but functional groups can play a large part in column selection. The polarity of the sample must closely match the polarity of the column stationary phase to increase resolution and separation while reducing run time. The separation and run time also depends on the film thickness (of the stationary phase), the column diameter and the <b>column</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E

Tables of retention indices can help identify components by comparing experimentally found retention indices with known values.|$|E

50|$|The colex (column exchange) {{separation}} method {{makes use}} of this by passing a counter-flow of amalgam and hydroxide through a cascade of stages. The fraction of lithium-6 is preferentially drained by the mercury, but the lithium-7 flows mostly with the hydroxide.At {{the bottom of the}} column, the lithium (enriched with lithium-6) is separated from the amalgam, and the mercury is recovered to be reused with fresh raw material. At the top, the lithium hydroxide solution is electrolyzed to liberate the lithium-7 fraction.

50|$|Like {{other forms}} of chromatography, {{increasing}} the <b>column</b> <b>length</b> enhances resolution, and increasing the column diameter increases column capacity. Proper column packing is important for maximum resolution: An over-packed column can collapse the pores in the beads, resulting {{in a loss of}} resolution. An under-packed column can reduce the relative surface area of the stationary phase accessible to smaller species, resulting in those species spending less time trapped in pores. Unlike affinity chromatography techniques, a solvent head {{at the top of the}} column can drastically diminish resolution as the sample diffuses prior to loading, broadening the downstream elution.|$|E

50|$|A gas {{chromatograph}} is a chemical analysis instrument for separating chemicals {{in a complex}} sample. A {{gas chromatograph}} uses a flow-through narrow tube known as the column, through which different chemical constituents of a sample pass in a gas stream (carrier gas, mobile phase) at different rates depending on their various chemical and physical properties and their interaction with a specific column filling, called the stationary phase. As the chemicals exit {{the end of the}} column, they are detected and identified electronically. The function of the stationary phase in the column is to separate different components, causing each one to exit the column at a different time (retention time). Other parameters {{that can be used to}} alter the order or time of retention are the carrier gas flow rate, <b>column</b> <b>length</b> and the temperature.|$|E

50|$|People with spondyloepiphyseal {{dysplasia}} are short-statured from birth, {{with a very}} short trunk and neck and shortened limbs. Their hands and feet, however, are usually average-sized. This type of dwarfism {{is characterized by a}} normal spinal <b>column</b> <b>length</b> relative to the femur bone. Adult height ranges from 0.9 meters (35 inches) to just over 1.4 meters (55 inches). Curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis and lordosis) progresses during childhood and can cause problems with breathing. Changes in the spinal bones (vertebrae) in the neck may also increase the risk of spinal cord damage. Other skeletal signs include flattened vertebrae (platyspondyly), a hip joint deformity in which the upper leg bones turn inward (coxa vara), and an inward- and downward-turning foot (called clubfoot). Decreased joint mobility and arthritis often develop early in life. Medical texts often state a mild and variable change to facial features, including cheekbones close to the nose appearing flattened, although this appears to be unfounded. Some infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth, which is called a cleft palate. Severe nearsightedness (high myopia) is sometimes present, as are other eye problems that can affect vision such as detached retinas. About one-quarter of people with this condition have mild to moderate hearing loss.|$|E
5000|$|On Saturday, May 16, 1868, the Star {{emerged from}} obscurity. “Today,” wrote Hamilton, “we resume the {{publication}} of the Los Angeles Star. Nearly four years have elapsed since our last issue. The little ‘onpleasantness,’ which at that time existed in the family, has toned down considerably, and if perfect harmony does not yet pervade the circle, our hope is this brotherly feeling will soon be consummated.” The paper was no longer the bitter partisan sheet that it had been during the early 1860s. Hamilton now seldom indulged in political leaders of a <b>column</b> <b>length,</b> and when he did they were of a mild type. The new Star was a seven column blanket sheet, and was devoted to promoting the welfare of the county. It was ably conducted, and was a model newspaper for a town of 5,000 inhabitants. June 1, 1870, the first number of the Daily Star was published by Hamilton & Barter. Barter retired from the firm in September and founded the Anaheim Gazette, the pioneer newspaper of Orange County, California. He bought the old press and type of the Wilmington Journal—the first press of the Star—and again the old press became a pioneer. When the Anaheim Gazette office burned down in 1877, the old press perished in the flames.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation of cold-formed steel channels with complex stiffeners subjected to pure axial compression for fixed-ended columns. The complex stiffeners {{of the channel}} sections consist of simple lips with return lips. A total of 30 column specimens were tested. The specimens were brake pressed from high strength zinc-coated structural steel sheets. Four different cross sections with different flange slenderness were tested over a range of <b>column</b> <b>lengths.</b> Detailed measurements of material properties, geometric imperfections, and local buckling loads of the specimens were conducted. Interaction of local and overall buckling was observed in the tests. Failure modes include local buckling, distortional buckling, and flexural-torsional buckling. The test strengths of the columns are compared with the design strengths predicted by the American Specification and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. Design column curves are also plotted. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the American Specification are generally unconservative for short and intermediate columns, whereas the design strengths predicted by the Australian/New Zealand Standard are generally conservative for all <b>column</b> <b>lengths.</b> This is because the Australian/New Zealand Standard has a separate check for distortional buckling of singly symmetric sections. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
