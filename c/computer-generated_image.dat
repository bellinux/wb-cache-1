5|$|In August 2008, it was {{announced}} that Talbot had signed a contract with Data Design Interactive for production of a video game on the Wii console.

Talbot re-recorded the album for the game. The game was scheduled for release {{in the first quarter of}} 2009, and is called Connie Talbot: Over the Rainbow. The game has never been released, citing copyright issues on the songs used for it.|$|E

25|$|Computer {{graphics}} {{are pictures}} and films created using computers.

The phrase was coined in 1960, by computer graphics researchers Verne Hudson and William Fetter of Boeing. It is often abbreviated as CG, though sometimes erroneously referred to as computer-generated imagery (CGI).|$|E

In particular, a facial reconstruction during the final episode showing what Jesus might have looked like garnered significant media attention. In the lead-up to episode one, several newspapers, including The Daily Mail and The Guardian, ran stories speculating whether the <b>computer-generated</b> <b>image</b> could show the true face of Jesus. British television listings magazine Radio Times featured the reconstructed face on the cover of its 31 March issue under the headline [...] "Is This the Face of Jesus?".

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} {{examined}} physiological measures of affect when viewing {{images from the}} International Affective Picture System (IAPS), <b>computer-generated</b> still <b>images,</b> and <b>computer-generated</b> videos of feared and non-feared stimuli. Twenty low fear (LF) and twelve high fear (HF) individuals viewed static and moving images of spiders and snakes. In both LF and HF subjects, <b>computer-generated</b> video <b>images</b> elicited more intense affective responses than the IAPS <b>images</b> and the <b>computer-generated</b> stills. <b>Computer-generated</b> still <b>images</b> were as effective in eliciting fear responses as the IAPS. These results suggest that <b>computer-generated</b> <b>images</b> can be as or more effec-tive as the IAPS in eliciting fear. Regardless of modality, HF subjects showed stronger physiological responses to their specifically feared stimulus (snake or spider) than to a non-feared stimulus...|$|R

40|$|Recent work in non-photorealistic {{rendering}} {{has produced}} results comparable to hand-drawn artistic images. Inspiration for such techniques {{has come from}} many traditional artistic techniques, such as pen-and-ink, to depict tone, depth, and shape. These techniques can create visually appealing images and increase understanding as is evident in their use in medical textbooks, popular science, etc. However, when <b>computer-generated</b> <b>images</b> are visually compared to similar hand-drawn images, {{studies have shown that}} subjects are generally able to determine differences between both images. This seems to indicate that there are different aesthetics associated with <b>computer-generated</b> <b>images</b> and hand-drawn images. This paper discusses the implications of varying aesthetics amongst hand-drawn and <b>computer-generated</b> <b>images,</b> focusing particularly on the application of stippling to provide tone and shape to an image. 1.

40|$|<b>Computer-generated</b> <b>images</b> {{have become}} the common means for architects and {{developers}} to visualise and market future urban developments. This article examines {{within the context of}} the experience economy how these digital images aim to evoke and manipulate specific place atmospheres to emphasise the experiential qualities of new buildings and urban environments. In particular, we argue that <b>computer-generated</b> <b>images</b> are far from ‘just’ glossy representations but are a new form of visualising the urban that captures and markets particular embodied sensations. Drawing on a 2 -year qualitative study of architects’ practices that worked on the Msheireb project, a large-scale redevelopment project in Doha (Qatar), we examine how digital visualisation technology enables the virtual engineering of sensory experiences using a wide range of graphic effects. We show how these <b>computer-generated</b> <b>images</b> are laboriously materialised in order to depict and present specific sensory, embodied regimes and affective experiences to appeal to clients and consumers. Such development has two key implications. First, we demonstrate the importance of digital technologies in framing the ‘expressive infrastructure’ of the experience economy. Second, we argue that although the Msheireb <b>computer-generated</b> <b>images</b> open up a field of negotiation between producers and the Qatari client, and work quite hard at being culturally specific, they ultimately draw ‘on a Westnocentric literary and sensory palette’ that highlights the continuing influence of colonial sensibilities in supposedly postcolonial urban processes...|$|R
