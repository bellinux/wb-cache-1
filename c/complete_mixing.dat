25|$|It is {{important}} that the gas mixture in a cylinder is thoroughly mixed before analysing or the results will be inaccurate. When partial pressure or mass blending is done at low flow rates the gases entering the cylinder are not moving fast enough to ensure good mixing, and particularly when blends contain Helium, they may tend to remain in layers due to density differences. This is termed stratification, and if left long enough, diffusion will ensure <b>complete</b> <b>mixing.</b> However, if the gas is to be analysed soon after blending, mechanical agitation is recommended. This may be by lying a single cylinder on a flat surface and rolling it for a short period, but twins are more usually inverted a few times. Stratification is more pronounced with blends containing helium, but can also lead to inaccurate analysis of Nitrox blends.|$|E

In {{the course of a}} threeyear period (2007 - 2009) the accredited laboratory of the Department for Nutrition and Botanics of the Faculty for Veterinary Medicine, Univerisity of Belgrade, analysed 65 fodder mix samples from the territory of Serbia intended for the diet of all categories of pigs, namely: 6 samples of <b>complete</b> <b>mixes</b> for the diet of pregnant sows and gilts, 9 samples of <b>complete</b> <b>mixes</b> for the diet of nursing sows and boar, 4 samples of <b>complete</b> <b>mixes</b> for enhanced diet of piglets, 13 samples of <b>complete</b> <b>mixes</b> for piglets in programme I up to 15 kg, 12 samples of <b>complete</b> <b>mixes</b> for piglets in programme II from 15 - 25 kg, 10 samples of <b>complete</b> <b>mixes</b> for growing pigs in fattening programme I from 25 - 60 kg, and 11 samples of <b>complete</b> <b>mixes</b> for pigs in fattening programme II from 60 - 100 kg. The analyses covered the contents of the elementary nutritive matter and the obtained results were compared with the quality conditions prescribed under the Regulations on the quality of animal feed (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No. 41 / 09).

The established average fat content was lower in the mixes for enhanced piglet diet (5. 99 ± 0. 72 %) and in mixes for piglet diet I, up to 15 kg (4. 95 ± 1. 41 %). A higher average cellulose content (4. 08 ± 0. 73 %) was established in mixes for enhanced piglet diet. Furthermore, significant differences from the values prescribed under the Regulations were established in certain samples. The established differences in the chemical composition of certain samples of the examined mixes without a doubt indicate the need for constant and multilevel monitoring of raw materials and finished products in order to preserve health and to ensure the best possible utilization of the production potential of animals.

Additionally, feeding method (<b>complete</b> <b>mixed</b> or free-choice) and processing method (ground or whole) were compared. The high-moisture milo (22 % moisture) was treated with either propionic acid (P. A.) 0. 6 % w/w, or ammonium isobutyrate (AIB) 1. 75 % w/w. Pigs fed high-moisture, acid-treated milo as a <b>complete</b> <b>mixed</b> ration gained {{at the same rate}} and were just as efficient in feed utilization as pigs fed the dry, <b>complete</b> <b>mixed</b> ration.

However, with growing pigs, free-choice feeding significantly (P<. 05) reduced daily gain.

If some edges of E(M) are undirected, then we can not obtain the lower bound in Theorem 3.8. For example, if (r_h)_ 12 =(r_h)_ 32 =i/ 2, (r_h)_ 13 = 1 / 2, then μ_ 1 = 1 and μ_ 2 =μ_ 3 =- 1 / 2.

40|$|An {{experiment}} involving three feeding trials {{was conducted}} to study the effect of substituting chopped wheat straw for alfalfa in diets for lactating dairy cows. The results of these trials have shown that in <b>complete</b> <b>mixed</b> diets or diets containing long alfalfa hay, replacement of half of the alfalfa in rations containing 45 % roughage for lactating dairy cows with chopped wheat straw does not adversely affect DM intake or milk yield and increase milk fat percentage. Replacing half of the long alfalfa with chopped alfalfa also apparently improved lactational performance although not as dramatically as that of chopped straw. Ammoniation of wheat straw did not improve the performance response by lactating cows. Inclusion of chopped straw in the diets seemed to enhance the efficiency of milk production. Higher ruminal acetate:propionate ratios and increased digestibility of ether extract resulted from feeding straw. Digestibility of other nutrients were generally either not affected or were depressed by straw feeding. Increasing the chopped wheat straw level to 75 % of the roughage resulted in lower DM intake and milk yield and negative body weight gains but higher milk fat levels. It did not appear that maintenance of constant ADF level in a dairy ration regardless of roughage level was {{the solution to the}} maintenance of milk fat levels. Thus it has been indicated that under the conditions of this experiment a combination of chopped alfalfa and wheat straw can be used successfully in <b>complete</b> <b>mixed</b> rations for high producing dairy cows.
