Of those aged 16to74, 21.7per cent had no academic qualifications, {{similar to the}} 21.3per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> all of Trafford, but lower than the 28.9per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> England. At 4.6per cent, Altrincham has a low proportion of non-white people. Asians are the area's largest ethnic minority, at 1.3per cent of the population.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, 14.6per cent of Altrincham's {{population}} was middle class, {{slightly higher than}} the figure for England and Wales, which was 14per cent. By 1971 this gap had increased to 28.8per cent compared to 24per cent nationally, while the town's working class population had declined, from 30.3per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> 1931 (36per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> England and Wales) to 18.6per cent (26per cent nationwide). The remainder comprised clerical and skilled manual workers. This change in social structure {{was similar to that}} seen across the nation– although biased towards the middle classes– making Altrincham the middle-class town it is today.|$|E
5|$|The canal made {{sufficient}} {{money to}} repay substantial debts in 1804 and 1805, after which dividends were {{paid to the}} shareholders, beginning at 2 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> 1806, rising to 5 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> 1815, and reaching their highest level of 8.6 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> 1839. The tolls brought in an income which remained below £9,000 until 1823, but then rose steadily to reach £13,079 in 1841. Traffic towards Grantham included coal and coke, lime, groceries and building materials. Some of it supplied villages {{along the line of}} the canal, and some of that which travelled the full distance was distributed by land to villages beyond Grantham. Downward traffic was largely agricultural produce, including corn, beans, malt and wool. Such produce was normally loaded at Grantham or Harby.|$|E
5000|$|There was a {{reduction}} in the [...] "real" [...] price of postage, with a nominal drop of the postage rate from 45 cents to 40 <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> 1996, and restoration of the 45 <b>cent</b> rate <b>in</b> 2004. Since then the cost has risen to 50 <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> 2007, to 60 <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> 2010 and to 70 <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> 2012.

50|$|There is no guarantee, however, {{that any}} savings from tort reform would be {{efficiently}} distributed. Tort reform in Texas during the 1990s created $600 million in savings for insurance companies while {{the fraction of}} policy dollars needed to cover losses fell from 70.1 <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> losses in 1993 to 58.2 <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> 1998.|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} adults owning shares rose from 7 per cent to 25 per cent during her tenure, {{and more than a}} million {{families}} bought their council houses, giving an increase from 55 per cent to 67 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> owner occupiers from 1979 to 1990. The houses were sold at a discount of 33–55 per cent, leading to large profits for some new owners. Personal wealth rose by 80 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> real terms during the 1980s, mainly due to rising house prices and increased earnings. Shares in the privatised utilities were sold below their market value to ensure quick and wide sales, rather than maximise national income.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportion}} {{of people living}} under poverty line was 60.5 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> 2010 compared to 62.8 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> 2006 as per the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS). The extremely poor formed 42.3 per cent {{of the total population}} as against 42.7 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> 2007. Around two per cent of the population was disabled, 35 per cent of which is accounted to diseases. Out of the disabled, 90.2 per cent were employed and the literacy rate of the disabled population remained at 58.6 per cent compared to the general literacy rate of 70.2 per cent. Albinism is a condition where people have little or no pigment in their eyes, skin or hair. As per the census, there were 25,324 albino people in the country with 12,532 males (49.48%) and 12,792 females (50.52%). The literacy rate of albino population was 66.1 per cent.|$|E
5|$|Depopulation {{stemming}} from the Black Death led to increased wages, static food costs and a resulting improvement in {{the standard of living}} for the peasantry. However, under Henry misgovernment and harvest failures depressed the English economy to a pitiful state known as the Great Slump. The economy was in ruins by 1450, a consequence of the loss of France, piracy in the channel and poor trading relations with the Hanseatic League. The economic slowdown began in the 1430s in the north of the country, spreading south in the 1440s, with the economy not recovering until the 1480s. It was also driven by multiple harvest failures in the 1430s and disease amongst livestock, which drove up the price of food and damaged the wider economy. Certain groups were particularly badly affected: cloth exports fell by 35 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> just four years {{at the end of the}} 1440s, collapsing by up to 90 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> some parts of the South-West. The Crown's debts reached £372,000, Henry's deficit was £20,000 per annum, and tax revenues were half those of his father.|$|E

5|$|A Post Enumeration Survey (PES) {{was carried}} out to find the common issues to be {{considered}} into account for future census enumeration activities. The results of the PES indicated that 92.7 per cent of total Zambian residents were captured in the 2010 census, leaving an under count of 7.3 per cent. The undercount was more in rural areas with an estimated 9.5 per cent {{of the total population}} and 3.8 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> the urban areas.|$|E
5|$|As in Normandy, the division's two {{parachute}} brigades {{were already}} on the ground before the 6th Airlanding Brigade started landing at 10:30 24March1945. The German defenders had been alerted, and the gliders were met by a concentrated anti-aircraft barrage. This caused the brigade around 40 per cent casualties in men and 50 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> equipment. Nevertheless, by 11:00 the 2nd OBLI and 1st RUR had captured their objectives. The 12th Devons landed amongst a German armoured formation, but managed to gather enough men together to begin their attack on Hamminkeln at 11:35, and had secured the town by 12:00.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1940 and 1944, a {{wholesale}} {{change in the}} coinage was carried out. Production of the [...] <b>cent</b> ceased <b>in</b> 1940, with bronze 1 <b>cent</b> introduced <b>in</b> 1942 with reduced weight and thickness. Nickel-brass replaced cupro-nickel <b>in</b> the 5 <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> the same year and replaced silver in the 25 and 50 <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> 1943. In 1944, nickel-brass, scalloped shaped 2 and 10 cents coins were introduced. The scalloped 10 cents coin replaced the silver 10 cents coin. Later 2 <b>cent</b> coins issued <b>in</b> 1957 were the only coins from this period to ever depict Queen Elizabeth II.

5|$|As of 2007, the brewing {{industry}} is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. As of 2006, more than 133 billion litres (35 billion gallons), {{the equivalent of a}} cube 510 metres on a side, of beer are sold per year, producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion). In 2010, China's beer consumption hit 450 million hectolitres (45 billion litres), or nearly twice that of the United States, but only 5 per cent sold were premium draught beers, compared with 50 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> France and Germany.|$|E

Much of the industrialization that did occur was as a subsidiary of cotton agriculture; many of the state's new textile factories were devoted to the manufacture of simple cotton bags. The price per pound of cotton plummeted from $1 {{at the end of}} the Civil War to an average of 20 <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> the 1870s, nine <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> the 1880s, and seven <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> the 1890s.

However, the non-Labor parties narrowly failed to dislodge the incumbent Dunstan Labor government. That result, together with internal weaknesses, led in 1976 to the LM's being re-absorbed into the LCL, which by then had become the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia. The non-Labor forces again failed at the 1977 state election but succeeded in winning government for one term at the 1979 state election.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the hearth}} tax returns from 1664, the {{township}} of Altrincham had {{a population of}} about 636, making it the largest of the local settlements; this had increased to 1,692 in 1801. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, the town's population increase by 165per cent, higher than 89per cent across England and 98per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> the Trafford area. The growth of the settlement was a result of the Industrial Revolution, and although Altrincham was one of the fastest growing townships in the Trafford area, but paled in comparison to new industrial areas such as Ashton-under-Lyne, Hyde, and Manchester. In the second half of the 19th century, Altrincham's population grew by 275per cent, higher than the 235per cent for Trafford and 69per cent nationally in the same period. This was due to the late industrialisation of the area and the introduction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway in 1849.
