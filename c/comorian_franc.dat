50|$|On 13 March 2015, {{the airline}} rebranded as Int'Air Îles and {{unveiled}} a new livery. On 22 June 2015, Ouani Airport in Anjouan required Int'Air Îles {{to pay an}} international tax on its flights {{from the airport to}} the French island of Mayotte, including 4 million <b>Comorian</b> <b>francs</b> in debt. The airline had previously been paying a domestic tax, eight times lower than the international tax. Ouani Airport said that if Int'Air Îles did not pay off the debt before 29 June, it would be banned from the airport. The airline refused to pay, citing the fact that the Comorian government considers Mayotte an island of the Comoros and thus a domestic destination; Int'Air Îles then suspended all operations. On 1 July the Ministry of Transport announced that Int'Air Îles had been charging higher prices for tickets to Mayotte than to the Comoros; thus they had to make up for it. An agreement was soon reached, with Int'Air Îles settling to pay its debts for April and May and agreeing to start paying the international tax. The airline resumed all flights on 14 July.|$|R
50|$|When France {{adopted the}} euro, {{so did the}} French {{overseas}} departments and territories that used the French franc. The CFP franc, the CFA franc and the <b>Comorian</b> <b>franc,</b> {{that are used in}} overseas territories and some African countries, had fixed exchange rates with the French franc, but not at par - for various historical reasons they were worth considerably less, at 1 French franc = 18.2 CFP francs, 75 Comorian francs or 100 CFA francs. The CFA franc and the <b>Comorian</b> <b>franc</b> are linked to the euro at fixed rates with free convertibility maintained {{at the expense of the}} French Treasury.

50|$|The island {{uses the}} <b>Comorian</b> <b>franc</b> as a {{currency}} which is printed by the Bank of France and {{issued by the}} central bank of the country, the Central Bank of the Comoros. The economy of the island is dependent on agriculture and related industries. These industries employ over 80% of the work force. The island's main food staple is rice, most of which must be imported. Anjouan is the world's primary exporter of ylang-ylang oil, an ingredient in almost all perfumes.|$|E

50|$|The Comoros {{is one of}} the world's poorest countries; its {{per capita}} gross {{national}} product (GNP—see Glossary) was estimated at US$400 in 1994, following the January devaluation of the <b>Comorian</b> <b>franc.</b> Although GNP increased in real terms at an average annual rate of 3.1 percent during the 1980s, rapid population growth effaced these gains and caused an average annual decrease in per capita GNP of 0.6 percent. Gross domestic product (GDP—see Glossary) grew in real terms by 4.2 percent per year from 1980 to 1985, 1.8 percent from 1985 to 1988, and 1.5 percent in 1990.

40|$|The 2000 {{market prices}} for vanilla and cloves have reached their highest level {{for ten years}} in the Comoros, thanks to the cyclone which devastated vanilla {{plantations}} in neighbouring Madagascar (the world s largest producer) and the unrest in Indonesia (the world s largest producer of cloves).

Together, these two spices account for half the country s agricultural exports, and one-quarter of all exports. In the 1999 - 2000 export season, they generated US$ 5 million (t 5. 7 million) in foreign exchange.
