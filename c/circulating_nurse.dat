40|$|AIM: To {{explore the}} nursing {{cooperation}} highlights of eight osteopetrosis patients underwent optic nerve decompression via transsphenoidal microsurgical approach instead of routine pathway, {{and to improve}} the quality of nursing cooperation. METHODS: We enrolled 8 cases(left eye in 3 cases, right eye in 5 cases) of osteopetrosis patients referred from the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University during February 2012 to November 2016. Patients received ophthalmic examinations including visual acuity and diagnostic imaging tests in pre-operation and post-operation. All eyes were performed surgical optic nerve decompression through endoscopic approach in assist of image guidance system. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and surgical cooperation procedure of these cases and summarized nursing cooperation experience. RESULTS: The operations of 8 patients were completed successfully without massive hemorrhage. Mean visual acuity improved from pre-operation(2. 5 ± 2. 1) to post-operation(3. 4 ± 1. 9). Cerebrospinal fluid leakage occurred in 1 patient and was instantly repaired during the operation. We performed the nursing strategy as postural drainage, condition monitoring and conscious assessment intra-and post-operation.

40|$|The {{hands-free}} {{technique is}} the indirect transfer of surgical instruments between surgeon(s) and other scrubbed personnel {{as well as}} circulating personnel, during which only one person touches the same sharp item at the same time. Items are usually placed in a designated neutral zone, {{which can be a}} section of the surgical field or a container, from where they can be retrieved. Use of the hands-free technique for passing sharp instruments during surgery has been recommended as a work practice by many professional organizations in order to reduce accidents, but its effectiveness has not been adequately studied. This study was designed to determine whether use of the hands-free technique resulted in a decrease in injuries, contaminations and glove tears. A prospective approach was used. All surgeries performed from the end of October, 1995 to mid-April 1996 at The Providence Medical Center in Seattle, Washington were eligible for inclusion in the study. In 3, 765 of 5, 388 (70 %) eligible surgeries performed during that five and one/half month period, <b>circulating</b> <b>nurses</b> filled out forms in the operating rooms right after a surgical case, assessing the proportion of passes done where no more than one person touched a sharp instrument at the same time. In addition to use of the hands-free technique during surgery, type of surgery, length of surgery, bloodloss during surgery, noise levels, emergency status, number of personnel present and time of day, were also recorded. Results. The hands-free technique was used, as defined, in about 42 % of the surgeries. In another 50 % of the surgeries it was used half the time or almost never. It was not used at all in 8 % of surgeries. An overall injury, contamination and glove tear rate of 3. 9 % was measured during the study period. Conclusion. Use of the hands-free technique at The Providence Medical Center during the study period was associated with a reduction in injuries, contaminations and glove tears, in surgeries with more than 100 cc blood loss but a similar reduction was not observed when blood loss was less than 100 cc.

40|$|Purpose: Fluoroscopic {{guidance}} is {{a routine}} practice in endourology; both the physician and the assistances {{are exposed to}} some radiation via radiation scatter. Measurement of radiation doses in staff is important, but often these data are not reported. Materials and Methods: We measured radiation exposure during 100 cases of percutaneous nephrolithotomy using lithium fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters placed at the head, eye glasses, the fingers, and {{the legs of the}} operating surgeon, the assistant, and the <b>circulating</b> <b>nurse.</b> Results: The mean screening time was 4. 5 minutes (range, 1 to 8 minutes) with mean fluoroscopy tube potential of 73 kVp, and mean tube current of 2. 8 mA. The estimated scatter exposure rate at 40 cm from the x-ray beam was 0. 47, 0. 04, 0. 21, and 4. 1 μGy to the head, eye glasses, the fingers, and thelegs of the operating surgeon, respectively. The estimated scatter exposure rate at different points from the x-ray beam was 0. 05, 0. 01, 0. 025, and 0. 1 μGy to the head, eye glasses, the fingers, and the legs of the assistant, respectively and the estimated scatter exposure rate at all different points from the x-raybeam for <b>circulating</b> <b>nurse</b> was 0 μGy.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{teamwork}} in healthcare. Healthcare {{is often described}} as complex. This description is more appropriate now than ever with the extensive specialization that has taken place in recent decades resulting in increasingly specialized physicians and nurses. While this specialization has made it possible to cure even sicker patients, it has also resulted in less overlapping knowledge and thus larger gaps between the different specialties’ areas of expertise. The method prescribed to overcome these challenges is often interprofessional teamwork. It is almost taken for granted that teamwork can make healthcare more efficient and that it is important for patient safety. Surgery in the operating room is an area where this is particularly prevalent. In the operating room anesthesiologists, anesthetist <b>nurses,</b> <b>circulating</b> <b>nurses,</b> scrub nurses and surgeons meet together as a team, in different constellations, to provide surgery for the patient. This thesis is concerned with the interprofessional team in the operating room, on how team members understand their common work, on how they concretely work together, and on how their practice and teamwork capabilities can be improved through organizational means. The thesis consists of five studies. The main methods used to collect data are interviews and observations using video. The video observations consisted of surgical procedures and group meetings. Depending on the purpose, the analysis of video data differed from more open exploratory bottom-up methodologies to top-down approaches, such as the usage of predefined observation protocols. The results indicate that the operating team is not as cohesive as might be assumed and that contradicting rationalities held among team members from different professions can at times result in tension in the team. A complementary alternative to the popular team training approach to improve teamwork is suggested in organizing for teamwork. The three organizational principles of team stability, occasions for communication and an adaptive approach to leadership are identified as important in order to organize for teamwork. As teamwork is associated with patient safety, this can potentially have implications for patient safety as well. The results also show that a popular routine to improve patient safety, the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist, is not actually used in reality as prescribed in the routine. This can lead to new risks if its correct usage is taken for granted and other behaviors are adapted accordingly. The perceived importance of different Checklist items and the conception of risk among its users should be considered in future efforts to improve Checklist usage. It is also shown that leadership in the operating room is distributed rather than something associated with a specific leader. This challenges traditional leader-centered perspectives on leadership in the operating room. An action oriented group method to facilitate organizational development and innovation was tested at the operating unit. The results show that the method worked well in the group and that the group managed to initiate a successful change project, but that the group’s anchoring at their organizational unit should be ensured. The studies in which this thesis is based show that practice in the operating room does not always look as expected. Methodologically, this means that methods that are capable of capturing the actual practice, such as observations, are valuable tools when studying complex healthcare settings, such as work in an operating room...|$|R
40|$|OBJECT: The risk of {{surgical}} site infection (SSI) after craniotomies or craniectomies in patients in whom contaminated bone flaps have been reimplanted {{has not been}} determined. The objectives {{of this study were}} to identify the prevalence of bone flaps with positive cultures [...] especially those contaminated with Propionibacterium acnes [...] to assess the risk of SSI after reimplanting (either during the initial operation or subsequently) bone flaps with positive cultures, and to identify risk factors for SSI following the initial craniotomies or craniectomies. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of cases in which patients underwent craniotomy/craniectomy procedures between January and October 2007 in the neurosurgery department at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. They also reviewed processes and procedures and did pulsed field gel electrophoresis of P. acnes isolates to look for a common source of contamination. They then conducted a prospective cohort study that included all patients who underwent craniotomy/craniectomy procedures between November 2007 and November 2008 and met the study criteria. For the cohort study, the authors obtained cultures from each patient 2 ̆ 7 s bone flap during the craniotomy/craniectomy procedures. Data about potential risk factors were collected by <b>circulating</b> <b>nurses</b> during the procedures or by a research assistant who reviewed medical records after the procedures. An infection preventionist independently identified SSIs through routine surveillance using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2 ̆ 7 s definitions. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed to determine the association between SSI and potential risk factors. RESULTS: The retrospective review did not identify specific breaks in aseptic technique or a common source of P. acnes. Three hundred seventy-three patients underwent 393 craniotomy/craniectomy procedures during the cohort study period, of which 377 procedures met the study criteria. Fifty percent of the bone flaps were contaminated by microorganisms, primarily skin flora such as P. acnes, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Staphylococcus aureus. Reimplanting bone flaps that had positive culture results did not increase the risk of infection after the initial craniotomy/craniectomy procedures and the subsequent cranioplasty procedures (p = 0. 80). Allowing the skin antiseptic to dry before the procedures (p = 0. 04, OR 0. 26) was associated with lower risk of SSIs. Female sex (p = 0. 02, OR = 3. 49) was associated with an increased risk of SSIs; Gliadel wafer implants (p = 0. 001, OR = 8. 38) were associated with an increased risk of SSIs after procedures to treat tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Operative factors such as the way the skin is prepared before the incision rather than the skin flora contaminants on the bone flaps may {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of SSIs after craniotomy/craniectomy. Gliadel wafers significantly increased the risk of SSI after procedures to treat tumors...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the significance of kiyo journals in terms of the cultural context. The present study consisted of (1) a review of literature focusing on Japanese culture and (2) a limited analysis of data obtained from a sample of kiyo journals. The study attempted to answer the following research questions: (1) how widely are kiyo journals <b>circulated</b> among <b>nursing</b> institutions? (2) to what extent does the content of the journals reflect the difference among nursing institutions? (3) how kiyo journals, if any, might be able to contribute to the advancement of nursing research, education, and practice? The results showed that kiyo journals are mainly circulated among the members of the publishing unit and to some extent, among institutions that have similar programs. Quantitative analyses on content variables showed that a larger number of nursing articles were published in the journal if the publishing unit was nursing only for both 3 -year and 4 -year college programs, t-tests showed significant differences between 3 -year and 4 -year colleges with regard to three content variables. Based on this study, future research guidelines are given. It was concluded that kiyo journals, if utilized with caution, have unique value and potential in advancing nursing research and scholarship...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundOver {{a period}} of years general {{anesthesia}} has been a standard anesthetic technique for defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing at the time of implant. DFT testing without general anesthesia cover has gained limited acceptance. Use of local anesthesia combined with deep sedation for DFT testing might facilitate and simplify these procedures by reducing the procedural time, staff time, avoiding inefficient service in organizing anesthetic cover; thereby improving patient compliance. ObjectiveThe objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate feasibility, safety and efficacy of conscious sedation for DFT testing during Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) implantation. MethodData of 87 non-selected patients who achieved adequate sedation with titrated doses of midazolam and pethidine were analyzed retrospectively. These medications were administered by a <b>circulating</b> <b>nurse</b> under the supervision of the implanting physicians. All hemodynamic measures, treatment and complications were monitored and recorded throughout the procedure. ResultsA retrospective analysis of data from 87 patients who underwent ICD implantation and DFT testing under conscious sedation at our center was reported. The mean dose of midazolam and pethidine administered was 4. 9 ± 1. 8 and 47. 7 ± 20 mg, respectively. During the period of conscious sedation, no patient depicted episode of sustained apnea. No major complication or mortality was reported. ConclusionUse of conscious sedation as an alternative to the use of general anesthesia for DFT testing during ICD implantation is found to be feasible, safe and effective, with an added advantage of reduced procedural time and improved patient compliance...|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis: Operating room {{turnover}} time (TOT) and daily caseload {{can be improved}} by analyzing the routine tasks of the operating team and minimizing inefficiencies. Design In this prospective study, the assigned tasks and work flow patterns of the anesthesiologist, <b>circulating</b> <b>nurse,</b> and surgical technologist during operations and operating room turnover were studied and changes were implemented where inefficiencies were observed. A brief pilot followed by a broader-scale study was conducted. Setting Tertiary care center. Participants Circulating nurses and surgical technicians were routinely assigned to work with one anesthesiologist and one surgeon during the pilot study; 4 surgeons and 32 anesthesiologists participated in the follow-up study. Interventions The work flow diagram of each individual was redrawn, and changes were implemented. Critical moments were identified, in which brief assistance from other personnel was needed to improve efficiency. Main Outcome Measures Operative TOT and number of daily operations were the main outcomes. A 2 -tailed t {{test was used to}} compare the TOTs; 2 analysis was used to compare the number of cases completed. Significance was defined as P<. 05. Results: A total of 401 operations and 253 turnovers were evaluated. Redesign decreased operating room TOT from 43. 7 to 27. 7 minutes (P<. 001). The mean number of cases completed per day increased from 1. 78 to 2. 34 (P<. 001). Conclusion: Interdisciplinary work flow assessment and redesign resulted in decreased operating room TOTs and additional cases being completed each day for 4 different surgeons...|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} {{debriefing}} after an interprofessional simulated crisis is widely recognised; however, {{little is known}} about the content of debriefings and topics that prompt reflection. This study aimed to describe the content and topics that facilitate reflection among learners in two types of interprofessional team debriefings (with or without an instructor) following simulated practice. Interprofessional operating room (OR) teams (one anaesthesia trainee, one surgical trainee, and one staff <b>circulating</b> OR <b>nurse)</b> managed a simulated crisis scenario and were randomised to one of two debriefing groups. Within-team groups used low-level facilitation (i. e., no instructor but a one-page debriefing form based on the Ottawa Global Rating Scale). The instructor-led group used high-level facilitation (i. e., gold standard instructor-led debriefing). All debriefings were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analysed using the inductive qualitative methodology. Thirty-seven interprofessional team-debriefing sessions were included in the analysis. Regardless of group allocation (within-team or instructor-led), the debriefings centred on targeted crisis resource management (CRM) content (i. e., communication, leadership, situation awareness, roles, and responsibilities). In both types of debriefings, three themes emerged as topics for entry points into reflection: (1) the process of the debriefing itself, (2) experience of the simulation model, including simulation fidelity, and (3) perceived performance, including the assessment of CRM. Either with or without an instructor, interprofessional teams focused their debriefing discussion on targeted CRM content. We report topics that allowed learners to enter reflection.

40|$|Annual {{consumption}} of amantadine increased abruptly after its {{approval for the}} treatment of influenza A virus infections in Japan in 1998, and the emergence of amantadine-resistant viruses is now a matter of concern. To detect resistant influenza A virus strains, we have developed a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis for nasopharyngeal swabs. Three different primer sets for nested PCR were designed to incorporate restriction sites into the amplicon to differentiate single-amino-acid substitutions at positions 27, 30, and 31 that confer resistance in the transmembrane domain of the M 2 protein. Each PCR product was digested with respective endonucleases (BspLU 11 I for amino acid change at position 27, HhaI for position 30, and ScaI for position 31), and the polymorphisms were determined by electrophoresis. Thirty-four (24. 1 %) of 141 PCR-positive samples had resistance patterns in eight nursing homes in the 1998 – 1999 season. Thirty-one viruses (91. 2 %) showed a change at position 31 (serine to asparagine), three viruses (8. 8 %) showed a change at position 30 (alanine to threonine), and none showed a change at position 27. The incidence of resistant viruses did not show any significant difference between four facilities where amantadine was used mainly for influenza treatment and four other facilities where it was used only for Parkinson’s disease, values being 27. 6 and 16. 3 %, respectively. We have confirmed that the PCR-RFLP method is useful for detecting amantadine-resistant strains directly from nasopharyngeal swabs and that resistant viruses were <b>circulating</b> in <b>nursing</b> homes where the drug was used not only for influenza virus but also for Parkinson’s disease...|$|R

40|$|In the {{operating}} theatre, communication problems {{are the leading}} cause of patient harm. Yet, relatively {{little is known about the}} actual interactions that take place in surgical operations between surgeons and nurses. The aim of the present study was to examine, in detail, nurses’ responses to surgeon’s requests, and to identify what kinds issues occur in these exchanges. A video-based study examining team communication was conducted in a major UK teaching hospital. A total of 20 general surgical operations were observed and video-recorded. In total, approximately 68 hours of video data were reviewed. A subsample of 9 operations (13 h 40 mins in total) has been analysed using interactional analysis developed within the social sciences. Distributional analysis of the response practices was also conducted. Theatre nurses responded to surgeons’ requests/questions either through (1) “action” (i. e. physical activity) or (2) “talk+action” (i. e. verbal acknowledgement + physical activity). Scrub nurses responded to requests significantly more through action only, and circulators used significantly more talk+action responses. Occasionally, nurses did not respond verbally and it became interactionally problematic. The conditions affecting the effectiveness of these responses were the immediacy and visual noticeability of responding. A verbal acknowledgement has an important role when a request cannot be fulfilled immediately, and when a surgeon has no visual access to the addressee of their request, such as a <b>circulating</b> <b>nurse.</b> The study has practical implications for training of simple communication practices that can impact on situational awareness and patient safety...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} impact of an {{automated}} intraoperative alert to redose prophylactic antibiotics in prolonged cardiac operations. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, evaluator-blinded trial. SETTING: University-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery that lasted more than 4 hours after the preoperative administration of cefazolin, unless they were receiving therapeutic antibiotics at the time of surgery. INTERVENTION: Randomization to an audible and visual reminder on the operating room computer console at 225 minutes after the administration of preoperative antibiotics (reminder group, n = 137) or control (n = 136). After another 30 minutes, the <b>circulating</b> <b>nurse</b> was required to indicate whether a follow-up dose of antibiotics had been administered. RESULTS: Intraoperative redosing was significantly more frequent in the reminder group (93 of 137; 68 %) than in the control group (55 of 136; 40 %) (adjusted odds ratio, 3. 31; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 97 to 5. 56; P &lt;. 0001). The impact of the reminder was even greater when compared with the 6 months preceding the study period (129 of 480; 27 %; P &lt;. 001), suggesting some spillover effect on the control group. Redosing was formally declined for 19 of the 44 patients in the reminder group without redosing. The rate of surgical-site infection in the reminder group (5 of 137; 4 %) was similar to that in the control group (8 of 136; 6 %; P =. 42), but significantly lower than that in the pre-study period (48 of 480; 10 %; P =. 02).

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} thoracoscopic {{technique}} for correcting and/or removing an intrathoracic disease process using our existing operating room equipment {{and without a}} "small thoracotomy. " Methods and Procedures: Fifty-eight patients from October 1994 to April 1998 were prospectively studied. All were undergoing procedures involving the removal of a suspected benign (or infectious) pleural process or a retained blood clot. Three or four thoracic ports were used in all cases. Straight and curved suction curettage cannulae (with finger valve attachment) ranging from 8 to 16 French were available for use. Intermittent variable suction (between zero and 60 mm Hg) was used in all cases. Dependent upon the size and adherence of the lesion to be removed, the pressure {{was determined by the}} surgeon and regulated by the <b>circulating</b> <b>nurse</b> in the room. In each case, a trap system was used for retrieval of the specimen. One lung ventilation was used in every case, and when suction was used one of the ports was kept "open " to allow room air to enter the chest cavity. Results: All patients in our series had their procedures completed without the need for any kind of open thoracotomy. Pre and postoperative diagnosis concurred in all 10 patients, and no complications occurred (specifically, no injury to the lung tissue or chest wall structures). Operative time ranged from 45 minutes to 180 minutes with a mean of 75 minutes. In all cases of a hemothorax, a cell saver system was used for an average of one unit of blood autotransfused per case.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{underline}} the importance of taking work practices into account for quality improvement (QI) purposes, highlight some of the challenges of doing so, and suggest strategies for future research and practice. Patient status at a glance, a Lean-inspired QI intervention designed to alleviate nurses of their knowledge mobilisation function, is deployed as an illustrative case. Design/methodology/approach – Ethnographic data and practice-based theories are utilised to describe nurses’ knowledge mobilisation work. The assumptions about knowledge sharing embedded in patient status at a glance white boards (PSAGWBs) are analysed drawing on actor network theory. Findings – There is a disparity between nurses’ knowledge mobilisation practices and the scripts that inform the design of PSAGWBs. PSAGWBs are designed to be intermediaries and to transport meaning without transformation. When <b>nurses</b> <b>circulate</b> knowledge for patient management purposes, they operate as mediators, translating diverse information sources and modifying meaning for different audiences. PSAGWBs are unlikely to relieve nurses of their knowledge mobilisation function and may actually add to the burdens of this work. Despite this nurses have readily embraced this QI intervention. Research limitations/implications – The study is limited by its focus on a single case and by the inferential (rather than the empirical) nature of its conclusions. Originality/value – This paper illustrates the importance of taking practice into account in healthcare QI, points to some of the challenges of doing so and highlights the potential of practice-based approaches in supporting progress in this field...|$|R
40|$|Background: Role of Radiology Department has {{significantly}} {{changed over the}} years, from diagnostics; the journey has now added many interventional procedures, which are carried out in guidance of CT, Ultrasound and Fluoroscopy. Despite such significant advancement, {{it has been observed}} that general perception of word angiography is associated with cardiac angiography. This study assessed the level of knowledge of student nurses regarding the angiographic procedure carried out in Radiology department. The nursing students during their learning period are rotated in Radiology department as well as come across patients in ward who require angiography. This audit will reveal the level of knowledge they have regarding this procedure ad access the level of awareness they have for the pre and post procedure preparations. Methods: radiology department staff in collaboration with school of Nursing, Aga khan university Hospital, conducted this survey. A simple survey form was <b>circulated</b> amongst Student <b>Nurses.</b> The forms were collected over a period of Two weeks. Data was summarized and results were evaluated. Results: A total of 100 forms were received. Survey revealed that 99 % knew about angiography however only 67 % were aware of non-cardiac angiography. 91 % responded positively about the awareness of location where as non cardiac and cardiac angiography were performed but on specific inquiry regarding the location only 7 were definite about all types of angiographies including cardiac, non cardiac (Radiology) and fluorescein angiography (eye). 45 knew about cardiac and radiological angiographies and 44 only knew about cardiac angiographies. With respect to indications, 47 had reasonable information and 38 had inadequate information. 55 % knew about the preparation for angiography whereas 45 % were not well aware of it. 91 % were aware of post angiography procedure whereas 9 % were not aware of them Conclusions: The results were indicative that generally, student nurses are not much aware of non-cardiac angiographies and procedure performed however, because of extensive dealing with cardiac angiographic patients the pre and post procedure care of patients is generally satisfactory.

Objectives: To identify current forms of school-based sexual health services (SBSHS) and school-linked sexual health services (SLSHS) in the UK, review and synthesise existing evidence from qualitative and quantitative studies concerning the effectiveness, acceptability and cost-effectiveness {{of these types of}} service and to identify potential areas for further research. Data sources: Electronic databases were searched from 1985 onwards. For published material: the Cochrane Library (1991 –), MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE (2007 –), CINAHL, EMBASE, AMED, ASSIA (1987 –), IBSS, ERIC, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index. For unpublished material and grey literature: the Social Care Institute of Excellence Research Register; the National Research Register (1997 –), ReFeR; Index to Theses, and HMIC. Review methods: A service-mapping questionnaire was <b>circulated</b> to school <b>nurses</b> {{in all parts of the}} UK, and semistructured telephone interviews with service coordinators in NHS and local authority (LA) roles were conducted. An evidence synthesis was performed {{based on a}} systematic review of the quantitative evidence about service effectiveness, qualitative evidence about user and professional views and a mixed-methods synthesis. A proof-of-concept model for assessing cost-effectiveness was drawn up. Results: Three broad types of UK sexual health service provision were identified. Firstly, SBSHS staffed by school nurses, offering ‘minimal’ or ‘basic’ levels of service. Secondly, SBSHS and SLSHS staffed by a multiprofessional team, but not medical practitioners, offering ‘basic’ or ‘intermediate’ levels of service. Thirdly, SBSHS and SLSHS staffed by a multiprofessional team, including medical practitioners offering ‘intermediate’ or ‘comprehensive’ levels of service. The systematic review showed that SBSHS are not associated with higher rates of sexual activity among young people, nor with an earlier age of first intercourse. There was evidence to show positive effects in terms of reductions in births to teenage mothers, and in chlamydial infection rates among young men, although this evidence coming primarily from the USA. Therefore, the findings need to be tested in relation to UK-based services. Also evidence to suggest that broad-based, holistic service models, not restricted to sexual health, offer the strongest basis for protecting young people’s privacy and confidentiality, countering perceived stigmatisation, offering the most comprehensive range of products and services, and maximising service uptake. Findings from the mapping study also indicate that broad-based services, which include medical practitioner input within a multiprofessional team, meet the stated preferences of staff and of young people most clearly. Partnership-based developments of this kind also conform to the broad policy principles embodied in the Every Child Matters framework in the UK and allied policy initiatives. However, neither these service models nor narrower ones have been rigorously evaluated in terms of their impact on the key outcomes of conception rates and sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates, in the UK or in other countries. Therefore, appropriate data were not found to support cost-effectiveness modelling. Limitations: Low response rate to the questionnaire. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were under-represented. Also, the distinction made in the questionnaire between ‘general health’ and ‘sexual health’ services did not prove robust. Conclusions: There is no single, dominant service model in the UK. The systematic review demonstrated that the evidence base for these services remains limited and uneven, and draws largely on US studies. Qualitative research is needed to develop robust process and outcome indicators for the evaluation of SLSHS/SBSHS in the UK. These indicators could then be used both in local evaluations, and in large, longitudinal studies of service effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Future research should examine the impact of the differing types of services currently evolving in the UK, encompassing school-based and school-linked models, as well as models with and without medical practitioner involvement...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The University Hospital of Modena {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{hospitals}} in the Emilia Romagna region and each yearabout 15. 000 surgery procedures are performed. We have been working on safety surgery, for safety of patients throughoutthe control of the correct function of surgical devices and sterilization of surgical instruments. In particular we have created andapplied a project called "SOS surgery" that included all the 4 objectives of the second Global Patient Safety Challenge "SafeSurgery Save Life" that are: Clean Surgery, Safe Anesthesia, Safe Surgical Teams, and Measurement. In agreement with theW. H. O. program we have decided to use the surgical safety check list to improve communication between all members of thesurgical team. Material and Methods: In October 2008 we started a trial for the application of the surgical check list. We have involved onegeneral surgery unit and we've appropriately trained the whole surgical team involved. We have identiﬁed as check listcoordinatora <b>circulating</b> <b>nurse</b> who conﬁrms completion of each step of the check list. At the end of procedures the whole teamagree and sign the check list. Results: During a period of three months we collected 175 check lists. The analysis of the data has highlighted 30 criticalevents (17 %) represented by surgical site not market in two cases, laterality not reported on the surgical note in one, change inanaesthesiological technique not reported on the surgical note in three, an inversion in the order of the procedures as plannedin another three, patient without the ID tag in one, the antibiotic prophylaxis not reported on the surgical note in seven, theabsence of the anaesthesiological consent in one, the absence of blood risk evaluation in three, a surgical team diﬀerent fromwhich on the surgical note in six, procedure not properly indicated on the surgical note in two and lack of preoperative patientpreparation in one case. In any case the critical events reported had clinical negative consequences on patients. Conclusions: The compliance of the whole surgical team in the application of the checklist has been satisfactory and itsapplication has been useful to check and avert critical events. It's our aim to extend its use ﬁrst of all to the other generalsurgery units and then to the other surgical specialties...|$|E
