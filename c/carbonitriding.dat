40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} {{identification}} of mechanical properties of <b>carbonitrided</b> steels using the spherical indentation test. The proposed procedure consists in performing the Vickers microindentation hardness test across the <b>carbonitrided</b> steel {{in order to obtain}} the thickness of the hardened layers. Thus, with the assumption of a linear variation of the plastic properties in the intermediate layers between surface and substrate, two spherical macroindentation tests, performed on the substrate and {{on the surface of the}} <b>carbonitrided</b> steel, are necessary to identify the work hardening laws' variation through the thickness of the <b>carbonitrided</b> steel. The proposed method does not call for inverse analysis but is based on the use of a database of finite element simulation F–h curves obtained by simulating indentation tests on the surface of various pseudo-carbonitrided materials. The advantage of this method compared to those based on inverse analysis is that it allows a representative strain and a confidence domain of the solution to be determined.

5000|$|Diffusion {{hardening}} {{can be done}} in {{many different}} ways to achieve different hardnesses and different surface finishes on metal parts. Some of the different diffusion hardening operations include: Carburizing, Nitriding, <b>Carbonitriding,</b> Nitrocarburizing, Boriding, Titanium-carbon diffusion, and Toyota diffusion. While diffusion hardening is performed mainly on steel parts and carbon is mainly the element used for diffusion, diffusion hardening can also be performed with other diffusion elements and with other metals. In nitriding, nitrogen is diffused into the surface of steel, but can also be used with metals such as Aluminum, Chromium, Molybdenum, and Vanadium. [...] Besides metals and diffusion elements used, diffusion hardening processes differ in the temperature required for diffusion, the phase of the diffusion element, and additional treatments such as quenching and tempering. These different factors greatly affect surface finish and dimensional accuracy of a part. A quenched and tempered part does not have the same dimensional accuracy as a part that has not undergone such a process. Also, they can affect the efficiency of the overall process. In carburizing, the carbon can be in any of the solid, liquid, or gas phases. Although using carbon in the solid phase is usually the safest and easiest of these to work with, the process is difficult to control and the heating is inefficient. All these things must come into consideration when choosing a diffusion hardening process.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Currently in {{the repair}} and {{manufacture}} {{at the stage}} of recovery of steel parts, widely used special coatings formed by electrolytic effects on ferrous ions. This technique offers high performance, ease of implementation, low cost of technological equipment and materials used, as well as easy automation of the process. However, this method has several disadvantages: low fatigue strength of reconditioned parts, insufficiently strong grip of the iron coating to the substrate, particularly in alloy steels, insufficient wear resistance. For the purpose of increasing durability and wear resistance of parts, restored through electrochemical action, it is proposed to use chemical-heat treatment, consisting {{in the application of}} <b>carbonitriding.</b> Investigated the efficacy of different modes of <b>carbonitriding</b> in the highly carburizing paste-and their influence on the structure and properties of iron plating. It is established that the nitrocarburizing both low and high temperatures repeatedly (6 - 7. 5 times) increases the microhardness of the coatings. The highest hardness is obtained by low-temperature <b>carbonitriding</b> with direct quenching in water. Conducting the <b>carbonitriding</b> process at low temperatures (650 °C), significantly increases the hardness of the iron coatings, increasing the limit of its fluidity, a and also greatly increases its endurance limit. Nitrocarburized fatigue strength of samples with iron precipitation on the surface, as shown by our studies, not only higher strength of the same samples without <b>carbonitriding</b> (more than 2 times), but higher than the fatigue strength of the base metal without coatings.
