2500|$|Osteosarcomas tend {{to occur}} at the sites of bone growth, presumably because {{proliferation}} makes osteoblastic cells in this region prone to acquire mutations {{that could lead to}} transformation of cells (the RB gene and p53 gene are commonly involved). Due to this tendency, high incidence of osteosarcoma is seen in some large dog breeds (St. Bernards and Great Danes). The tumor may be localized {{at the end of the}} long bone (commonly in the metaphysis). Most often it affects the proximal end of tibia or humerus, or distal end of femur. Osteosarcoma tends to affect regions around the knee in 60% of cases, 15% around the hip, 10% at the shoulder, and 8% in the jaw. The tumor is solid, hard, irregular ("fir-tree," [...] "moth-eaten", or [...] "sun-burst" [...] appearance on X-ray examination) due to the tumor spicules of calcified bone radiating in right angles. These right angles form what is known as a <b>Codman</b> <b>triangle,</b> which is characteristic but not diagnostic of osteosarcoma. Surrounding tissues are infiltrated.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Codman</b> <b>triangle</b> (previously {{referred}} to as Codman's triangle) is the triangular area of new subperiosteal bone that is created when a lesion, often a tumour, raises the periosteum away from the bone. [...] A <b>Codman</b> <b>triangle</b> is not actually a full triangle. Instead, it is often a pseudotriangle on radiographic findings, with ossification on the original bone and one additional side of the triangle, which forms a two sided triangle with one open side. This two sided appearance is generated due to a tumor (or growth) that is growing at a rate which is faster than the periosteum can grow or expand, so instead of dimpling, the periosteum tears away and provides ossification on the second edge of the triangle.|$|E

40|$|Ewing's sarcoma occurs {{most often}} in young males of {{caucasian}} type and affects the medio-diaphysis of a long bone of the lower extremity, the pelvis and the humerus. Radiologically there is bone destruction, onion skin appearance, a <b>Codman</b> <b>triangle</b> and extension into the surrounding soft tissues. Microscopically, this tumor is composed of small round cells {{and it can be}} differentiated from non Hodgkin lymphoma, metastatic neuroblastoma and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Recent immunological studies suspect a neuroectodermal origin. Ewing's sarcoma growths rapidly and spreads to lung and other bone locations. Without treatment, survival at 5 years is less than 5 %. The actual therapeutic approach is multidisciplinary including surgery, chemotherapy and if necessary radiotherapy. With this approach actual survival rates at 5 years reaches 75 %.
