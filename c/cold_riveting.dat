40|$|Abstract. Metastable beta {{titanium}} alloy Ti- 5 Mo- 5 V- 8 Cr- 3 Al, with high-strength, favorite ductility and outstanding capacity of cold forming and welding, {{has been found}} the applications in sheet metal component, pressure vessel, corrugated shell and <b>cold</b> heading <b>rivet</b> at the temperature lower than 350 ℃. In the present paper, the effect of cold machining deformation rate and heat treatment process on the properties and microstructures of Ti- 5 Mo- 5 V- 8 Cr- 3 Al strip were investigated. The results revealed that excellent comprehensive mechanical properties could be achieved with the alloy by reasonable cold machining process and with solution treatment at 800 ℃ followed by gas quenching. Upon a solution and aging treatment at 480 ℃, the alloy performed favorite plasticity and high ultimate tensile strength of 1250 MPa...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue tests {{carried out}} on three {{configurations}} (unexpanded, <b>cold</b> expanded and <b>riveted)</b> of fiber metal laminate material clearly demonstrated the beneficial effect of <b>riveting</b> compared to <b>cold</b> expansion in zero load transfer joints, for an approximately equivalent level of interference. Digital image correlation {{was used to measure}} the in-plane surface strain on <b>cold</b> expanded and <b>riveted</b> coupons during fatigue loading, and for the first time, digital image correlation was combined with pressure sensitive films to measure the strains resulting from the application of the rivet, including those under the rivet head. A comparison of the resultant strain field showed that the application of a rivet significantly reduces the stress concentration at the central hole and is effective in extending fatigue life. Some rivet heads were removed by milling, and the results from subsequent fatigue tests were used together with closed-form calculations to explain the findings of this study. It was concluded that the beneficial effect of riveting was less as a result of interference hole filling {{on the part of the}} rivet shank, but more a combination of the effect of interference and compression through the joint thickness.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of fiber metal laminates (FML) in aerospace structural applications led to an investigation into whether current FML layups could be improved to provide a better response during <b>cold</b> expansion and <b>riveting</b> of holes. Static measurements of the residual strain during cold expansion of holes were made using digital image correlation. Various grades of FML as well as 2024 -T 3 aluminum were investigated with the results leading {{to the design of}} a new FML layup. Static strength testing of this new FML variant demonstrated that its elastic modulus compared well to more traditional FML. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
60|$|All this time, I {{was getting}} on towards the river; but however fast I went, I couldn't warm my feet, {{to which the}} damp <b>cold</b> seemed <b>riveted,</b> as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet. I knew {{my way to the}} Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there on a Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that when I was 'prentice to him, {{regularly}} bound, we would have such Larks there! However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last too far to the right, and consequently had to try back along the river-side, on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide out. Making my way along here with all despatch, I had just crossed a ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and had just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man sitting before me. His back was towards me, and he had his arms folded, and was nodding forward, heavy with sleep.|$|R
40|$|In {{order for}} new {{composite}} materials like fiber metal laminates (FML) to gain acceptance in the aerospace field, {{it is important}} to understand the effect on them of common manufacturing techniques such as <b>riveting</b> and <b>cold</b> expansion. A comprehensive research program was initiated using two advanced strain measurement techniques; digital image correlation and thermoelastic stress analysis, to understand the failure mechanisms in FML materials that had been fatigue cycled after having undergone hole <b>cold</b> expansion or <b>riveting.</b> Prior theoretical work has shown the potential for improvement in fatigue life of FMLs, so one standard grade of FML (FML 4 - 3 / 2) and a novel FML variant were manufactured and tested. Thermoelastic stress analysis was employed to measure strains on the mandrel exit face while digital image correlation was used to measure strains on the mandrel entry face in the coupons and additional insight was gained regarding the effect of the cold expansion process and of riveting on fatigue crack growth. The results also highlighted the effect of material design on fatigue life as well as the interaction between residual strains and fatigue crack growth. 92010 Society for Experimental Mechanics Inc.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Over {{the last}} few years {{considerable}} effort has been put into the improvement of the fatigue life of aircraft structures. Aircraft experience complex loading conditions during flight and safe operation requires understanding of the underlying mechanics of fatigue crack growth. One of the outcomes of the research carried out over the last thirty years is that fatigue cracks in metals are partially closed over part of a load cycle. This phenomenon is thought by many researchers to be the key to understanding the effect of non-uniform loading. Understanding crack closure is particularly challenging when initial residual stress fields (e. g. due to manufacturing or mechanical treatment) need to be taken into account. For example, rivet holes are a critical area for fatigue and they are usually cold expanded to create a beneficial residual stress field and to improve the fatigue performance. This paper describes the development of a simple analytical model for plasticity-i nduced fatigue crack closure taking into account the residual stresses due to <b>cold</b> expansion of <b>rivet</b> holes. The model is compared to a more sophisticated finite element analysis of plasticity-induced crack closure. The results show that the residual stress field has a strong influence on the closure behaviour and therefore on fatigue crack propagation. The potential for the application of this model to real components is assessed by modelling some experiments taken from the literature. The model results agree with the experimental findings for the location of fatigue crack initiation. Residual stresses from FE analyses of cold expansion were used as an input to the analytical closure model, which successfully predicted crack propagation from cold-expanded holes...|$|R
