The members of the ACLT freely volunteer their time in attempting to raise awareness in the Black community; enabling potential donors to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> be involved in the process of offering hope and a healthy future to someone whose disorder may otherwise prove fatal. Dixon has also backed Nickelodeon's See Something, Say Something campaign, a UK anti-bullying initiative.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, B Company {{succeeded in}} holding their hastily {{constructed}} defensive positions {{throughout the night}} and until 05:00 on 8 October when the Chinese finally gave up. In order to preserve its remaining strength, the Chinese 191st Division was forced to pull back by , surrendering the control of Hill 217 without a fight. At first light more than 120 Chinese dead and wounded lay around the Australian defences and {{in contrast to the}} savage fighting during the night, Chinese stretcher parties were allowed to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> collect their wounded under a flag of truce. The Australians had been victorious but were now exhausted after five days of heavy fighting.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E
5|$|Odin {{will make}} {{directly}} for Fenrir and the god Thor, by Odin's side, {{will be unable}} to help him because he will be fighting Jörmungandr. The god Freyr will engage the fiery being Surtr and, since Freyr lacks the sword he gave his servant Skírnir, Freyr will fall after a rough struggle. The god Tyr will fight the hound Garmr and the two will kill one another. Thor will kill the serpent Jörmungandr but after nine steps will collapse to the ground, dead from Jörmungandr's venom. Fenrir will eat Odin, but immediately after Odin's son Víðarr will <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> set his foot on to the wolf's lower jaw, and grasp its upper jaw, ripping its mouth apart, killing it. Loki and Heimdallr will kill one another and, after their death, Surtr will spray fire over the earth and burn the entire world.|$|E

25|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses taught that if, in the land, they found the body of a murder victim lying in the open, and they could not determine the killer, then the elders and judges were to measure the distances from the corpse to the nearby towns. The elders of the nearest town were to take a heifer that had never worked down to an ever-flowing wadi and break its neck. The priests were to <b>come</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> all the elders were to wash their hands over the heifer.|$|E

25|$|Pakistan {{has had a}} {{moratorium}} on executions since 2008. Currently there are approximately 800 people on death row in Pakistan in terrorism related cases. The move comes following the widely held perception that terrorists are never brought to justice in Pakistan. Many times, the judges and witnesses are too scared to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> award due sentences to the terrorists. And even when the terrorists are convicted and sent to prison, the frail policing system of Pakistan has seen many jailbreaks, including the Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan jailbreaks, in which many high-profile terrorists escaped.|$|E
25|$|The Otago Daily Times's Tokomairiro {{correspondent}} {{reported on}} 23 March that a writ {{for the election}} of a replacement was issued, and that the dates for a nomination meeting and election were set for 31 March and 8 April, respectively. As of 23 March, no candidates had <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> the newspaper stated that their reporters had not heard any rumours about potential candidates either. On the day prior to the nomination meeting, still no candidates had come forward, despite discussions on Frederick Moss as a suitable representative. Moss had declined becoming a candidate due to private engagements.|$|E
25|$|Since 2003, {{the central}} {{government}} showed an increasing openness on AIDS issues, making several public statements encouraging {{the participation of the}} private sector and, to some extent, NGOs. This was due, in part, to the SARS epidemic, which helped change the way in which government dealt with public health issues. For a prolonged period, the authorities did not admit to having a serious outbreak of SARS until it was a devastating problem and only then did they decide to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> acknowledge the real scale of the epidemic. The new-found frankness helped the government win back some credibility before the international community.|$|E

25|$|The {{day after}} Captain Taheri’s execution, his family {{asserted}} his innocence {{in an open}} letter published {{in the press and}} called on his fellow officers to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> testify. The letter also refuted the allegation regarding the defendant's guerrilla training in the US and referred {{to the fact that he}} had never traveled outside Iran. The letter refuted the charge related to the Cinema Rex fire noting that Captain Taheri had never been in Abadan and that there are documents proving that at that time he was on vacation elsewhere. The Medal of Honor, it stressed, was given to him prior to the Rex Cinema fire.|$|E
25|$|On February 11, 2009, {{charges against}} Chicago Police Department {{officers}} Tom Sherry and Carl Suchocki were dropped. A Cook County judge dismissed all criminal charges {{accusing them of}} robbery and home invasion after some evidence was proven to be false, and witnesses in the case against Sherry and Suchocki were unable to place the officers {{at the scene of}} the crime. Charges against Herrera and Finnigan, however, are still pending. As of September 25, 2009, seven former SOS officers have pleaded guilty to charges relating to the scandal. The investigation is ongoing as police officers continue to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> cooperate with the state and federal investigation.|$|E
25|$|Age falsification is the {{practice}} of advancing gymnasts' ages to make them age-eligible for senior-level competition. Reports of age falsification among top-level international gymnasts first began to surface in the 1980s, after the age limit was raised from 14 to 15. This has frequently taken the form of inconsistently reported birthdates; at other times, speculation has been raised due to the young appearance of the gymnasts. Age falsification has been revealed and confirmed in several ways. In some cases, gymnasts themselves have <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> publicly confirmed and verified the falsification. In other cases, documents revealing inconsistencies, such as original birth certificates, have been researched and uncovered by the press. Inconsistencies with reported birth dates and ages at international and national competitions have also led {{to the discovery of}} age falsification.|$|E

25|$|An archaeological {{evaluation}} of the suspected burial sites {{was carried out in}} May 2008 by the Glasgow University Archaeological Research Division (GUARD). This limited survey and excavation confirmed that the sites contained the bodies of British and Australian soldiers from the First World War, and this led to the funding of a larger project to fully excavate the site. The main excavation was carried out by Oxford Archaeology from May to September 2009, and resulted in the recovery of 250 British and Australian bodies from five mass graves, and some 6,200 individual artefacts. Appeals have been made for relatives of soldiers known to have died in the battle to <b>come</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> DNA analysis by LGC Forensics is being carried out in an attempt to identify the bodies.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} Church of the Nazarene congregations had worship {{services}} (each lasting about an hour) {{three times a}} week: Sunday morning, Sunday evening, and Wednesday evening. The Sunday evening service was more evangelistically focused with gospel songs sung rather than hymns, testimonies given, and often concluded with an altar call inviting those seeking either salvation or entire sanctification to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> kneel at the altar. However, increasingly in recent years, the Sunday and Wednesday evening services in many Nazarene churches have changed from worship services to discipleship training, and many growing churches have utilized weekly small group meetings. Worship services typically contain singing a mix of hymns and contemporary worship songs, prayer, special music, reading of Scripture, sermon, and offering. Services are often focused toward a time of prayer and commitment {{at the end of}} the sermon, with people finding spiritual help as they gather for corporate praying.|$|E
25|$|Following Liberal leader Gerry Reid's {{defeat in}} the 2007 general {{election}} he resigned as the party's leader. The party subsequently chose Cartwright-L'Anse au Clair MHA Yvonne Jones as interim leader {{of the party and}} therefore the Official Opposition Leader in the House of Assembly. The party delayed calling a leadership election until 2010, and when nominations for the leadership closed on July 30, 2010 Jones was the only candidate to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> was acclaimed leader of the party. Only weeks later on August 13, 2010, Jones announced she had been diagnosed with breast cancer and would be taking time off to undergo treatment. During her time off Liberal House Leader Kelvin Parsons took over for Jones on an interim basis. The Liberal convention that would swear Jones in as leader was rescheduled from October 2010, to May 2011, due to her illness. She was sworn in as leader on May 28, 2011. On August 8, 2011, it was announced that Jones would step down as leader the following day on the advice of her doctor. The Liberal Party executive chose former MHA and cabinet minister Kevin Aylward as her successor on August 14, 2011.|$|E
