40|$|Parvovirus B 19 (B 19) is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} the common childhood disease, erythema infectiosum (EI), also named fifth disease. About 50 % of humans are infected during childhood, but the virus is also transmitted to adults and about 80 % of the elderly are seropositive. Apart from asymptomatic infection, which is common, the clinical presentations in EI are usually slight <b>catarrhal</b> symptoms and <b>fever</b> followed by rash, typically intense on cheeks and later distributed on the extensor parts of legs and arms. For infected adults, the rash is less common, whereas the frequency of arthropathy, which may last for months or years, is about 50 %. The main replicative sites of the virus are erythropoetic cells, and anaemia is a well-known manifestation of the infection, especially in immunocompromised patients. Pregnant women,when infected, {{are at risk of}} spontaneous abortion, hydrops fetalis and, later in pregnancy, intrauterine fetal death. B 19 has also been associated with rheumatologic diseases, hepatitis, myocarditis and neurological manifestations. In 1993, we used PCR-technique and found B 19 DNA in the bone marrow (BM) of a patient with chronic fatigue, anaemia and leukopenia. Since then, we have followed her and other patients with chronic symptoms of fatigue, arthralgia and fever and found that some of them have persistent B 19 DNA in BM for years after primary infection. The prevalence of B 19 DNA in BM in the general population was not previously Imown To get a hint of the frequency, we tested the BM of 100 patients with haematological disorders, from whom BM samples were available, and in 4 % B 19 DNA PCR was positive. In the studied group, 59 % were B 19 IgG-positive and we concluded that B 19 DNA in BM is not a general finding in seropositive individuals. Arthropathy is a common manifestation of B 19 infection in adults and sometimes even meets the official criteria for rheumatoid arthritis. Consequently, the frequency of B 19 DNA in BM of rheumatic patients is of interest. We studied a group of 50 patients with various rheumatological diseases. B 19 DNA was found in 13 of 50 patients (26 %), a significantly higher level than in our previous study. Immunocompromised patients are susceptible to B 19 infection, but our hypothesis is that individuals, who are otherwise immunocompetent, may have a selective immune deficiency with respect to B 19 causing the virus to persist and evoke symptoms of chronic immunological stimulation. To confirm this hypothesis, we have studied patients with persistent B 19 DNA in BM with regard to general immunological parameters such as HLA-type, lymphocyte subpopulations and cytokine profiles. We also investigated the specific CD 8 T-cell response to B 19 antigens with an ELISpot assay for detecting IFNã production. Although the patients with persistent B 19 DNA in BM had no general, uniform immunological aberration, their B 19 specific cellular immune responses diverged from those of controls supporting our hypothesis of a selective immune deficienc...|$|R
40|$|Background. One of the {{widespread}} acute respiratory viral infections is influenza. During periods of epidemic recovery, the morbidity increases to 25 %. The highest prevalence of influenza is observed among children. The {{seriousness of the}} problem is determined not only by the high morbidity of influenza, which often take form of epidemics and pandemics, but also by the risk of developing severe complications with frequent lethal outcomes. The purpose of the research was to analyze the respiratory morbidity of children for the period from 2009 to 2017, and to study clinical and laboratory features of influenza in the past epidemic season of 2016 – 2017. Materials and methods. 335 medical records of children with acute respiratory viral infection (ARVI) and influenza for the period from November 2016 to March 2017 were analyzed. Virological investigations were carried out by polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunoassay in virological laboratory of Dnipropetrovsk region laboratory center of MH of Ukraine. The research was conducted using the sampling method, taking into account the characteristics of the clinical pattern of respiratory disease and the time of admission to a hospital from the onset of the disease. Results. The analysis of the morbidity of influenza and ARVI for the period from 2009 to 2017 made it possible to distinguish early increases in the incidence of influenza in 2009 – 2010 and in the past epidemic season of 2016 – 2017. During the seasons of 2012 – 2013 and 2013 – 2014, an increase of ARVI and influenza morbidity was observed in March. In the season of 2016 - 17, the higher morbidity of influenza was detected among toddlers and schoolchildren. Only in 24 (26. 6 %) out of 90 children with clinically suspected influenza, a positive result of virological study was received. The diagnosis of influenza A/H 3 N 2 was confirmed in most of the examined children (24. 4 %) and influenza B — in 2. 2 % children. The typical for influenza symptoms of intoxication, <b>fever,</b> <b>catarrhal</b> symptoms were observed in the clinical picture. The hyperthermia was within 38 – 39  °C in most children (46. 2 % cases). However, almost one third of children (35. 1 %) had high and hyperpyretic fever, which indicated a severe influenza. We noted that a more expressed intoxication syndrome was observed in children of senior school age. Symptoms of typical influenza intoxication in young children were absent or were not so critical. Catarrhal syndrome was identified only in 85 % of children. In 11. 7 % of cases, the symptoms of a digestive tract lesion in the form of vomiting (8. 2 %), nausea (1. 2 %), abdominal pain (2. 3 %) were observed. The complicated course of influenza was characterized by involvement of convulsive syndrome and the lower respiratory tract infection in the form of bronchitis and pneumonia. In the age group from 1 to 3 years, convulsive syndrome was observed in 5 children (5. 5 %) with high fever. In the group of preschool children, the course of influenza infection was complicated by the development of bronchitis in 3. 6 % of the examined children. The severe course of influenza {{led to the development of}} pneumonia in 5. 4 % of patients. Pneumonia was mainly observed in children of senior school age and was characterized by a low-symptomatic clinical picture. Conclusions. The study made it possible to note the following features of the epidemic season of 2016 – 2017 : early onset of the active influenza period from November; dominance of influenza A/H 3 N 2; less aggressive course of influenza (moderate forms). Complicated course of influenza A/H 3 N 2 was more often observed in the age groups of schoolchildren and young children. The severe course of influenza infection was characterized by prolonged high fever, as well as the involvement of convulsive syndrome and the lesion of the lower respiratory tract. The feature of the influenza infection course in young children was the absence of specific symptoms, which made it difficult to diagnose the flu early and to assess the risk of a complicated course of the disease...|$|R

50|$|Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus must be {{transmitted}} via bites from Culicoides gnats (Culicoides verripennis) and cannot {{be transmitted}} directly from deer to deer. EHDV manifests itself as Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) which has similar symptoms to Adenovirus hemorrhagic disease (AHD), “bluetongue” disease and malignant <b>catarrhal</b> <b>fever.</b> Instead of being spread by a vector like EHDV, AHD is spread from animal to animal by direct contact and bodily fluids. EHDV is also antigenically different from “bluetongue” disease but the clinical signs of each disease are very similar. EHDV causes deer {{to lose their}} fear of humans and causes weakness, excessive salivation, bloody diarrhea, fever, rapid pulse and rapid respiration rate. Hemorrhage and lack of oxygen in the blood results in a blue appearance of the oral mucosa {{which is where the}} name “bluetongue” comes from. Bodies of infected deer are frequently found in bodies of water where they laid down in an attempt to lower their body temperature before becoming unconscious and dying. These symptoms develop about seven days after the animal was exposed to the virus and 8-36 hours after the onset of initial observable signs, deer progress into a shock-like state, collapse and die.|$|E
50|$|Another set of {{problems}} to unfold for the Maasai was the rapid increase in population of the wildebeest. Wildebeest calves carry a virus that transmits the disease malignant <b>catarrhal</b> <b>fever</b> that can kill Maasai livestock if exposed to the same areas the wildebeest calves grazed on. Not only the exposure to a deadly disease affect the livestock, {{but also because of}} the large wildebeest population, grasses were hardly left for Maasai livestock to feed on. During the early 1970s, a stricter ban was placed on cultivation to where any cultivation within the NCA area became illegal. The Maasai's subsistence is dependent on the cultivation of grains, from which the Maasai would trade livestock with cultivators for grains. For twenty years, the Maasai endured a ban on cultivation, more restrictions on highland craters and the spread and increase in livestock disease. Because of the inability to cultivate, there was an increase in malnutrition and under nutrition among the children of the Maasai. It was not until the early 1990s that the ban on cultivation was lifted. After the lift of the ban, there was an increase in living for the Maasai. Malnutrition declined and sustainable living emerged. But because of the intense cultivation to support the population, conservationists are now reevaluating whether to allow cultivation to continue, so again, the faith of the Maasai are left in the hands of more policy making and restrictions in which none have a voice in.|$|E
5000|$|Unfortunately {{a vaccine}} for {{malignant}} <b>catarrhal</b> <b>fever</b> (MCF) {{has not yet}} been developed. [...] Developing a vaccine has been difficult because the virus will not grow in cell culture and until recently it was not known why. Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) found that the virus undergoes changes within the animal's body, a process known as [...] "cell tropism switching". In cell tropism switching, the virus targets different cells at different points in its life cycle. This phenomenon explains why it has been impossible to grow the virus on any one particular cell culture. Because the virus is transmitted from sheep to bison and cattle, researchers are first focusing on the viral life cycle in sheep. The viral life cycle is outlined in three stages: entry, maintenance, and shedding. Entry occurs through the sheep's nasal cavity and enters into the lungs where it replicates. The virus undergoes a tropic change and infects lymphocytes, also known as white blood cells, which {{play a role in the}} sheep's immune system. In the maintenance stage the virus remains on the sheep's lymphocytes and circulates the body. Finally, during the shedding stage, the virus undergoes another change and shifts its target cells from lymphocytes to nasal cavity cells, where it is then shed through nasal secretions. This discovery undoubtedly puts scientists on the right track for developing a vaccine - starting with the correct cell culture for each stage of the virus lifecycle - but ARS researchers are also looking into alternative methods to develop a vaccine. Researchers are experimenting with the MCF virus that infects topi (an African antelope) because it will grow in cell culture and does not infect cattle. Researchers hope that inserting genes from the sheep MCF virus into the topi MCF virus will ultimately be an effective MCF vaccine for cattle and bison. [...] While there is much ground left to cover, scientists are getting closer and closer to developing a vaccine.|$|E
5000|$|Although these cattle {{were and}} are an {{important}} part of the pastoral economy of Africa, Diane Gifford-Gonzalez and others have found that cattle domestication in Eastern and Southern Africa was delayed by as much as a millennium past everywhere else. The tentative date for domestication of cattle is set around 9000 BP. Archaeologists that work at sites dating back to the 10th millennia; such as Nabta Playa, claim that cattle remains found at their sites come from domestic cattle. The basis of these archaeologist arguments is that cattle are not usually found with certain kinds of desert-adapted animals that they are also finding at these sites. Even so, Gifford-Gonzalez is not entirely sure that the genetic findings should be fully trusted as there is a wide-margin for errors in the findings. This delay occurred even though the ancestor of the modern, domestic cattle was originally from northern Africa. One cause of this delay may have been the uncharacteristically wet-period that went through eastern Africa from 12,500-7000 BP, where rainfall was 35% higher than it is today. This wet period caused all the lakes and rivers to rise dramatically and changed all the flora of the area so that they were less grassland-like and more forest-like. Once the rainfall dropped to more modern levels in 3000 BP, pastoralism picked up as well. Along with the steadying of the rains, there is also evidence of Nderit ceramics that appears in south-central Kenya between 5000 BP and 4000 BP. Nderit pottery found south of Lake Turkana is usually associated with local hunter-gatherers. Local hunter-gatherers may have adopted these ceramics and a few domestic animals while still practicing their hunting-and-gathering lifestyles. Another cause for the delay could have been due to disease of the cattle, such as Bovine Malignant <b>Catarrhal</b> <b>Fever</b> (MCF), which is almost 100% lethal for cattle. Another problem she found was the diseases that affect humans, such as Rift Valley Fever (RVF), East Coast Fever (ECF), foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), and trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). As of right now, it is impossible to tell if coming into contact with cattle caused epidemics of unfamiliar diseases.|$|E
