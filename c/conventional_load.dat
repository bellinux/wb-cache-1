However, {{at the end of a}} 1  year observation period, functional differences between the two groups had disappeared. Postoperative pain was the only significant difference, with a lower value in the immediate loading groups after the third day [40]. A study, however, showed that immediate loading evoked more postoperative pain on the first day and more swelling on the third day rather compared to the delayed loading. The study compared immediate and delayed loading of single implants to support mandibular overdentures, thus suggesting that the number of implants could affect the decision about whether immediate <b>loading</b> or <b>conventional</b> <b>loading</b> should be considered [41].|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{aim of this}} {{clinical}} {{study was to determine}} if progressive bone loading was effective in improving bone density and rigidity of implants. Materials and Methods: 11 implants were placed with <b>conventional</b> <b>loading</b> and 14 implants were placed with progressive loading. The Periotest instrument was used to assess implant mobility. Mean difference of values were recorded in both qualities of bone. Results: <b>Conventional</b> <b>loading</b> in poor quality bone showed a significant decrease in rigidity of the bone as compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>loading</b> in good quality of bone. Progressive loading in both poor and good quality bone showed a significant increase in bone rigidity. Conclusion: Implants should not be loaded conventionally in poor quality bone but should be progressively loaded to prevent decrease in density and rigidity around implants...|$|R
50|$|Owing to the {{anisotropic}} {{nature of}} this material, the hardness depends on the crystal orientation. The (002) plane contains the most covalent character and exhibits a maximum Vickers hardness value of 40.5 GPa, while the perpendicular planes were 6% lower at 38.1 GPa. These values decrease with increased load, settling at around 28 GPa each. The nanoindentation values {{were found to be}} 36.4 GPa and 34.0 GPa for the (002) and perpendicular planes respectively. The hardness values depend on the material purity and composition - the more boron the harder the boride - and the above values are for a Re:B ratio of approximately 1.00:1.85. Rhenium diboride also has a reported bulk modulus of 383 GPa and a shear modulus of 273 GPa. The hardness of rhenium diboride, and most other materials also depends on the load during the test. The above values of about 40 GPa were all measured with an effective load of 0.5-1 N. At such low load, the hardness values are also overestimated for other materials, for example it exceeds 100 GPa for c-BN. Other researchers, while having reproduced the high ReB2 hardness at low load, reported much lower values of 19-17 GPa at a more <b>conventional</b> <b>load</b> of 3-49 N, that makes ReB2 a hard, but not a superhard material.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Load Balancing in cloud {{computing}} is dissimilar from <b>conventional</b> <b>load</b> balancing techniques, {{because of the}} limitations in <b>conventional</b> <b>load</b> balancing techniques if they are deployed in the cloud; hence they are unsuitable for the cloud environment. Since the cloud {{is designed to provide}} scalable infrastructure, it is difficult to build a scalable architecture in order to take the advantage of scalable infrastructure, because of several issues that differentiate cloud from traditional organizational infrastructure and we can’t leverage all that scalability in infrastructure if our architecture is not scalable, both have to work together. In this paper we discuss those issues and limitations of <b>conventional</b> <b>load</b> balancing techniques if deployed in cloud, importance of building scalable architecture for cloud by exploring scalability solutions provided by cloud vendors. Finally, we propose a generalized framework for building scalable load balancing architecture for cloud environment. Keywords — Cloud- computing, Load balancing, scalable cloudarchitecture. 1...|$|E

30|$|The <b>conventional</b> {{protocol}} for <b>loading</b> of rough-surfaced dental implants, i.e., {{placement of the}} prosthetic crown, recommends undisturbed healing after surgery for 3  months in the mandible and 4 – 6  months in the maxilla [11, 12] to allow the osseointegration process to take place. However, it would be beneficial if the healing period could be shortened without jeopardizing implant success [13].
