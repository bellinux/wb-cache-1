5000|$|<b>Captan</b> was {{previously}} cited as Group B2, a probable human carcinogen by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but was reclassified in 2004. Since {{the mode of}} action has been established as a proliferative response (in mice only) after intestinal villi are disrupted, <b>captan</b> has been deemed not likely to cause tumors at doses that do not irritate the intestine. The EPA now states, [...] "The new cancer classification considers <b>captan</b> to be a potential carcinogen at prolonged high doses that cause cytotoxicity and regenerative cell hyperplasia. These high doses of <b>captan</b> are many orders of magnitude above those likely to be consumed in the diet, or encountered by individuals in occupational or residential settings. Therefore, <b>captan</b> {{is not likely to}} be a human carcinogen nor pose cancer risks of concern when used in accordance with approved product labels. A similar reclassification has been made for folpet, captan's sister fungicide, which shares a common mechanism of toxicity. A key finding for <b>captan</b> (and folpet) is these fungicides are not mutagenic in vivo; that is, they are not mutagenic in the intact animal.|$|E

50|$|With metal ions, thiolates {{behave as}} ligands to form {{transition}} metal thiolate complexes. The term mercaptan {{is derived from}} the Latin mercurium <b>captans</b> (capturing mercury) because the thiolate group bonds so strongly with mercury compounds. According to hard/soft acid/base (HSAB) theory, sulfur is a relatively soft (polarizable) atom. This explains the tendency of thiols to bind to soft elements/ions such as mercury, lead, or cadmium. The stability of metal thiolates parallels that of the corresponding sulfide minerals.|$|R
50|$|<b>Captan</b> is {{the name}} of a general use {{pesticide}} (GUP) that belongs to the phthalimide class of fungicides. Though it can be applied on its own, <b>Captan</b> is often added as a component of other pesticide mixtures. It is used to control diseases on a number of fruits and vegetables as well as ornamental plants. It also improves the outward appearance of many fruits, making them brighter and healthier-looking. <b>Captan</b> is utilized by both home and agricultural growers and is often applied during apple production. It is also active against certain oomycetes, such as Pythium, making it useful for controlling damping off.|$|E

Thiols {{are used as}} odorants {{to assist in the}} detection of natural gas (which in pure form is odorless), and the [...] "smell of natural gas" [...] is due to the smell of the thiol used as the odorant.

50|$|Monie Ralph <b>Captan</b> (born May 28, 1962) was {{the foreign}} {{minister}} of Liberia from 1996 until 2003, former of Presidential Affairs 1996. During most of that time he served under President Charles Taylor. Captan's mother was a native of Liberia and his father was Lebanese. Before serving as foreign minister, he was a local businessman, owner of an independent Liberian newspaper and a professor at the University of Liberia. During the Liberian Civil War, his newspaper expressed views which sometimes came across as being sympathetic to Charles Taylor and his National Patriot Front of Liberia (NPFL). When Taylor won the elections, he was subsequently named foreign minister. He is one of several Liberian elites who were not members of Taylor's NPFL to be appointed to high level positions. During the Liberian Civil war he resided in Monrovia which was never controlled by the NPFL.

50|$|Perchloromethyl {{mercaptan}} is the organosulfur compound {{with the}} formula CCl3SCl.

It is insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents. It has a foul, unbearable, acrid odor. Perchloromethyl mercaptan is the original name. The most common name is trichloromethanesulfenyl chloride, because the compound is a sulfenyl chloride, not a mercaptan.|$|E

Apple cultivars can be ranked {{in order of}} increasing resistance as follows: Indo, Red Gold, Raritan, Delicious, Fuji, Golden Delicious, Ralls, Toko, Tsugaru, Mutsu, Jonagold, Jonathan.

5000|$|Almond scab {{was first}} {{documented}} in almond orchards in the 1950s. However {{it did not}} become a major disease until sprinkler irrigation became popular in the 1980s. By the early 1990s almond scab could be found throughout California almond orchards. Scab infects leaves, fruit, and twigs in almonds causing dark spots to form. Scab lesions look greasy and oily. The major concern with almond scab is partial or complete defoliation of the tree. [...] As with leaf blight use of <b>captan</b> and ziram {{has been shown to}} reduce total incidence of almond scab infection.|$|E
5000|$|The Law Reform Commission of Canada {{noted in}} a 1987 report that Canadian agriculture's {{increasing}} dependence on pesticides had led to inaction against many of those approved {{on the basis of}} IBT's research data. Agriculture Canada banned use of Reglone until further safety testing could be conducted and evaluated by Health and Welfare Canada, though application of the chemical continued illegally on a significant majority of lentils produced. Chlorbromuron, cyprazine, dinitramine, and phosphamidon were also banned [...] "because their manufacturers did not promise replacement studies," [...] with Allidochlor and <b>Captan</b> being restricted.|$|E
50|$|After the {{founding}} of the National Patriotic Party and Taylor's success in the 1997 presidential election, Minor was appointed to the Senate, the only female in the government. Following the death of incumbent Keikura B. Kpoto, she was elected President of the Senate in October 2002, the first woman to hold the post. She purchased a house and consultancy firm in Osu, Accra which was managed by her sister. Her son-in-law, Monie <b>Captan,</b> was appointed Foreign Minister. In 2001, she was placed on a United Nations Security Council list of 120 political leaders who were banned from travel outside of Liberia.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, Watson was party {{chairman}} during an intense fight by conservatives, {{led by the}} colorful attorney <b>Captan</b> Jack Wyly of Lake Providence, and the nationalist wing of the party, represented by Leon Irwin, III, of New Orleans for the position of national committeeman, which was vacated after eight years by J. Marshall Brown of New Orleans. Irwin, who carried the support of Governor-elect Edwin Edwards, Mayor Moon Landrieu, and AFL-CIO President Victor Bussie, defeated Wyly, 69-50, in balloting by the Democratic State Central Committee. Wyly's forces won only in North Louisiana and the Florida parishes.|$|E
5000|$|Leaf blight of almonds {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1950, and by 1983 it had {{spread throughout the}} Sacramento Valley. Almond leaf blight {{is characterized by the}} death of leaves throughout the summer. The fungus interferes with water conduction in the leaf. In fall and winter, dormant buds are killed by an extension of the lesion and in the spring, flowers are killed. [...] Repeated attacks of leaf blight, though rarely killing more than 20% of the leaves, ultimately reduce tree vigor. Experiments have shown that the use of ziram and <b>captan</b> can reduce the incidence of leaf blight by 75-80% in treated trees.|$|E
50|$|Shot hole affects almonds by disrupting {{both the}} leaves and {{the fruit of the}} plant. It can result in {{premature}} nut ripening and plant defoliation. In some occasions, especially when rain persists in the springtime, complete defoliation and tree weakening can occur. Estimates have shown that approximately 80% of California's almond acres are infected with this fungus. A four-year research project by the Almond Board of California determined that production losses from shot hole could range from 50 to 75%. <b>Captan</b> in one to three applications has been used as the primary fungicide to combat this disease. It has been shown to reduce lesions per fruit by 96%.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{effectiveness}} of fungicide application and it’s relatively minor damage to crops, there are few cultural controls and no resistant peach variants that have been developed for the current market. For prevention of peach scab, proper pruning of leaves to allow adequate sunlight will drastically reduce the risk of infection and propagation. The primary form of regulation for peach scab requires frequent applications of commercial fungicides. There are three main types of fungicides that are effective against peach scab: <b>captan,</b> chlorothalonil, and demethylation inhibitors. Proper use of chlorothalonil requires application starting from shuck split and reapplication every two weeks. Increased temperature and wet weather will necessitate more frequent applications. Applications are necessary until 4-6 weeks until harvest.|$|E
