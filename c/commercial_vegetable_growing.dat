40|$|The first {{practical}} genetic sexing strain for the melon fly, Bactrocera cucurbitae, {{developed in}} Hawaii was mass-reared and released as sterile males into wild fly populations. Significant {{improvements in the}} field quality of sterile males were made with the pupal color strain in which males can be separated from females {{on the basis of}} pupal coloration using photoelectric sorting machines. Earlier, quality control tests indicated that the strain mass-rears adequately, and is very competitive with wild flies based on field cage studies of mating ability and survival. Open field studies were conducted between 2002 and 2004 on three Hawaiian islands in increasingly larger test areas, and with increasing numbers of sterile males released (up to 1, 500, 000 /wk). Results indicated that the sexing strain significantly impacted the wild population, causing high, induced sterility up to ca. 75 % in both residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>growing</b> areas of Hawaii. The field tests have shown that the sexing strain is worthy of mass production and release in large-scale melon fly SIT programs...|$|E

40|$|In East Java, {{many kinds}} of {{vegetables}} are grown under tropical climatic conditions and various field conditions which are derived from complex geographical features. The main sites for <b>vegetable</b> <b>growing</b> {{were found to be}} paddy fields, upland fields including sloping lands and gardens. The paddy and upland fields are relatively large and are usually used for <b>commercial</b> <b>growing</b> of <b>vegetables.</b> Most gardens are small in area and they are in the range of about 100 ~ 300 m^. Many kinds of vegetables including traditional ones are grown intensively mainly for self-supply in small gardens. At elevations of about 800 m or higher, several vegetables which were derived from temperate zone have been grown successfully in East Java. The major <b>vegetable</b> <b>growing</b> areas are established according to their elevation and soil or field conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper assesses <b>commercial</b> <b>vegetable</b> {{production}} in Calabar. Urban <b>vegetable</b> farming in <b>commercial</b> quantity is mainly embarked upon by poorly educated farmers {{who engage in}} vegetable production as an income-generating activity. Most vegetable farms in Calabar were located essentially at the dried swamp (or wetland) soils and close to major highways and roads {{in order to attract}} consumers. This paper specifically attempts to describe the socioeconomic characteristics of <b>commercial</b> <b>vegetable</b> farmers, their production systems, and the costs and returns involved in the enterprises. The enterprises are profitable as N 0. 63 is the return on every Naira invested and they rely on hired workers as an important {{production in}}put. The major problems associated with urban <b>commercial</b> <b>vegetable</b> production in the study area include access to land, credit and improved technology, lack of skilled labour and exotic species. In conclusion, this paper emphasizes the need to create an enabling environment for urban <b>commercial</b> <b>vegetable</b> production and integrating urban agriculture within the framework of urban policies formulation...|$|R
