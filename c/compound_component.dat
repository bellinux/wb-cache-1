The dependence on fossil fuels as primary energy source has led to global climate change, environmental degradation, and human health problems. In order to reduce dependence on commercial energy, steps have been taken to develop an alternative source, such as biogas.

This article presents initial work on a method for mapping between functional requirements and {{a description of the}} physical structure of discrete static systems. The representation consists of a set of atomic elements, a hierarchy of <b>compound</b> <b>components</b> from the domain, and the composition ofa graph of adjacent atomic elements. Through forward or backward chaining, this method may be used in a parsing mode to discover the behavior and function of a given system, or in a generative mode to suggest instances of systems which can be used to satisfy the desired functionality. Parsing discovers the behavior of the system in terms of the <b>compound</b> <b>components</b> by matching on subgraphs within the overall adjacency graph. Generation hierarchically instantiates subgraphs which satisfy the initial functional requirements and the requirements propagated by previously instantiated components. The graph is composed from a geometric model, but the method is independent of the specific representation used by the geometric modeler.

40|$|The VAV {{terminal}} unit with variable-speed (VS) fan and reheat coil is an air system {{terminal unit}} {{consisting of a}} variable speed fan in series with a heating coil. These units are usually employed in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems where the air is supplied at low static pressure through an underfloor plenum. The fan is used to control the flow of conditioned air that enters the space. When the fan is off the plenum pressure drives the minimum air flow through the terminal unit. At maximum cooling the fan runs at its maximum speed. At full heating the fan runs at its heating maximum – usually less than the cooling maximum flow rate. Thus this unit has two separate maximum flow rates – one for heating and one for cooling. For cooling, control is maintained simply by varying the fan speed. For heating, the unit first tries to meet the heating load by varying the heating coil output while keeping the air flow at minimum (fan off). If this is not adequate the fan turns on and operates in variable flow mode up to the heating maximum flow rate. This unit is modeled in EnergyPlus as a <b>compound</b> <b>component</b> – a variable speed fan and a heating coil in series in the air stream. The unit is blow through – the fan is upstream of the heating coil. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{control system}} for {{autonomous}} distribution {{and control of}} electrical power during space missions is being developed. This system should free the astronauts from localizing faults and reconfiguring loads if problems with the power distribution and generation components occur. The control system uses an object-oriented simulation model of the power system and first principle knowledge to detect, identify, and isolate faults. Each power system component is represented as a separate object with knowledge of its normal behavior. The reasoning process takes place at three different levels of abstraction: the Physical Component Model (PCM) level, the Electrical Equivalent Model (EEM) level, and the Functional System Model (FSM) level, with the PCM {{the lowest level of}} abstraction and the FSM the highest. At the EEM level the power system components are reasoned about as their electrical equivalents, e. g, a resistive load is thought of as a resistor. However, at the PCM level detailed knowledge about the component's specific characteristics is taken into account. The FSM level models the system at the subsystem level, a level appropriate for reconfiguration and scheduling. The control system operates in two modes, a reactive and a proactive mode, simultaneously. In the reactive mode the control system receives measurement data from the power system and compares these values with values determined through simulation to detect the existence of a fault. The nature of the fault is then identified through a model-based reasoning process using mainly the EEM. <b>Compound</b> <b>component</b> models are constructed at the EEM level and used in the fault identification process. In the proactive mode the reasoning takes place at the PCM level. Individual components determine their future health status using a physical model and measured historical data. In case changes in the health status seem imminent the component warns the control system about its impending failure. The fault isolation process uses the FSM level for its reasoning base...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1991 Interactive, direct-manipulation, {{graphical}} {{user interfaces}} are easy to use but difficult to construct. This dissertation shows that automatic constraint satisfaction is useful in many facets of user interface construction and demonstrates that it is feasible. A constraint represents a desired relationship between variables. While some constraints are required to be satisfied, others may be merely preferred to varying degrees. Such preferential constraints allow the programmer to control {{the behavior of the}} constraint solver declaratively. In user interface construction, constraints can represent relationships at three levels: between application data structures and user interface components, between the components of a user interface, and between the parts of a <b>compound</b> <b>component.</b> A system that automatically maintains these relationships frees the programmer from many tedious and error prone tasks. This dissertation focuses on a constraint satisfaction technique known as local propagation. It shows how to frame local propagation as a graph problem, and proves that, in general, this problem is NP-complete. It then identifies a restricted form of the problem that can be solved efficiently by the DeltaBlue algorithm, an incremental local propagation solver that handles preferential constraints. The major contributions of this dissertation are to prove that the DeltaBlue algorithm is correct, to demonstrate that it is fast enough to provide low latency, high bandwidth interactive feedback in systems with as many as 20, 000 constraints, and to show that it is powerful enough to solve many of the constraint problems that arise in user interface construction. It also addresses a number of related issues, such as how to integrate constraints with imperative programs cleanly, how to model user inputs as constraints, how to compile constraints, and how to maintain constraints on collections incrementally. Finally, it describes ThingLab II, a programming environment for constructing constraint-based user interfaces, and its use to build a number of user interfaces...|$|E
