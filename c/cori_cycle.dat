It converts pyruvate, {{the final}} product of glycolysis, to lactate when oxygen is absent or in short supply, and it performs the reverse reaction during the <b>Cori</b> <b>cycle</b> in the liver. At high concentrations of lactate, the enzyme exhibits feedback inhibition, {{and the rate of}} conversion of pyruvate to lactate is decreased.

40|$|Hyperlactatemia is {{associated}} with an ominous prognosis in critical illness and must be rapidly detected. Lactate is produced by glycolysis through reduction of pyruvate, itself oxidized in the mitochondria. It is transported to the liver and converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis (<b>Cori's</b> <b>cycle).</b> Hyperlactatemia can result from excessive production or reduced clearance. Excess production can occur in aerobic conditions, following an increase in pyruvate generation, or in anaerobic conditions, due to impaired pyruvate oxidation. Reduced lactate clearance {{occurs as a result}} of liver hypoperfusion or hepatic failure. Lactate/pyruvate ratio, as well as the concomitant existence of metabolic acidosis (lactic acidosis), help distinguish the different mechanisms leading to hyperlactatemia, which are reviewed in detail in this article...|$|R

In 1928, they became naturalized citizens of the United States. The director for the Institute threatened to dismiss Gerty {{if she did not}} cease collaborative research with her husband. She continued to work with Carl and was also kept on at the Institute. She was constantly in the laboratory, where we two worked alone. We washed our own laboratory glassware and she would occasionally complain bitterly to Carl about not having any dishwashing help. When she tired, she would retire to her small office adjoining the laboratory, where she would rest on a small cot. She smoked incessantly and dropped cigarette ashes constantly... Joseph Larner Although the Coris were discouraged from working together at Roswell, they continued to do so, specializing in investigating carbohydrate metabolism.

They published fifty papers while at Roswell, with first author status going to the one who had done most of the research for a given paper. Gerty Cori published eleven articles as the sole author.

25|$|In vertebrates, vigorously {{contracting}} skeletal muscles (during weightlifting or sprinting, for example) do {{not receive}} enough oxygen to meet the energy demand, and so they shift to anaerobic metabolism, converting glucose to lactate. The liver regenerates the glucose, using a process called gluconeogenesis. This process is not quite the opposite of glycolysis, and actually requires three {{times the amount of}} energy gained from glycolysis (six molecules of ATP are used, compared to the two gained in glycolysis). Analogous to the above reactions, the glucose produced can then undergo glycolysis in tissues that need energy, be stored as glycogen (or starch in plants), or be converted to other monosaccharides or joined into di- or oligosaccharides. The combined pathways of glycolysis during exercise, lactate's crossing via the bloodstream to the liver, subsequent gluconeogenesis and release of glucose into the bloodstream is called the <b>Cori</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E
25|$|Substrates {{within the}} muscle {{generally}} serve to power muscular contractions. They include molecules such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glycogen and creatine phosphate. ATP binds to the myosin head and causes the ‘ratchetting’ {{that results in}} contraction according to the sliding filament model. Creatine phosphate stores energy so ATP can be rapidly regenerated within the muscle cells from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ions, allowing for sustained powerful contractions that last between 5–7 seconds. Glycogen is the intramuscular storage form of glucose, used to generate energy quickly once intramuscular creatine stores are exhausted, producing lactic acid as a metabolic byproduct. Contrary to common belief, lactic acid accumulation doesn't actually cause the burning sensation we feel when we exhaust our oxygen and oxidative metabolism, but in actuality, lactic acid in presence of oxygen recycles to produce pyruvate in the liver, which {{is known as the}} <b>Cori</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} {{lactate dehydrogenase}} enzyme {{consists of four}} protein subunits. Since the two most common subunits found in lactate dehydrogenase are encoded by the LDHA and LDHB genes, either variation of this disease causes abnormalities {{in many of the}} lactate dehydrogenase enzymes found in the body. In the case of lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency, mutations to the LDHA gene results in the production of an abnormal lactate dehydrogenase-A subunit that cannot bind to the other subunits to form the complete enzyme. This lack of a functional subunit reduces the amount of enzyme formed, leading to an overall decrease in activity. During the anaerobic phase of glycolysis (the <b>Cori</b> <b>Cycle),</b> the mutated enzyme is unable to convert pyruvate into lactate to produce the extra energy the cells need. Since this subunit has the highest concentration in the LDH enzymes found in the skeletal muscles (which are the primary muscles responsible for movement), high-intensity physical activity will lead to an insufficient amount of energy being produced during this anaerobic phase. This in turn will cause the muscle tissue to weaken and eventually break down, a condition known as rhabdomyolysis. The process of rhabdomyolysis also releases myoglobin into the blood, which will eventually end up in the urine and cause it to become red or brown: another condition known as myoglobinuria. Some other common symptoms are exercise intolerance, which consists of fatigue, muscle pain, and cramps during exercise, and skin rashes. In severe cases, myoglobinuria can damage the kidneys and lead to life-threatening kidney failure. In order to obtain a definitive diagnosis, a muscle biopsy may be performed to confirm low or absent LDH activity. There is currently no specific treatment for this condition.|$|E
40|$|Increased fasting hepatic glucose {{production}} {{is present in}} NIDDM patients, and {{has been shown to}} be due to increased gluconeogenesis. In order to determine the contribution of the cycling between glucose and three-carbon compounds (<b>Cori</b> and glucose-alanine <b>cycles)</b> to the increased hepatic glucose production, glucose kinetics measured overnight in seven obese NIDDM patients and six lean healthy subjects with both 6. 6 2 H glucose and U- 13 C glucose were determined. At 0500 h obese NIDDM subjects showed a 40 % increase in glucose appearance calculated from 6. 6 2 H glucose, whereas glucose appearance calculated from U- 13 C glucose was similar compared to lean subjects, indicating increased glucose cycling. Non-oxidative glucose disposal was also increased three-fold in NIDDM patients. Glucose cycling was increased by 111 % in NIDDM patients (118 +/- 18 mumole min- 1 vs. 56 +/- 11 in controls, P < 0. 05) and was positively correlated with plasma glucose concentration (r = 0. 831, P < 0. 001) and with non-oxidative glucose disposal (r = 0. 714, P < 0. 01). Four NIDDM patients were studied again after 3 days of insulin therapy. Insulin restored near-normoglycaemia (7. 4 +/- 0. 8 mmole l- 1) and normalized rates of glucose appearance and glucose cycling. It is concluded that increased glucose cycling in obese NIDDM patients accounts for a major part of the increased fasting hepatic glucose production and non-oxidative glucose disposal in obese NIDDM subjects...|$|R
40|$|Concomitant {{measurements}} of sytemic glucose delivery and carbohydrate oxidation are frequently performed in human investigations. Systemic glucose delivery (SGD) is usually determined using dilution of infused glucose tracers; net carbohydrate oxidation rate (net CHOOX) {{can be calculated}} from respiratory gas exchanges and urinary nitrogen excretion (indirect calorimetry); alternatively, glucose oxidation can be measured from labelled CO 2 production during infusion of carbon-labelled glucose tracers. In this paper, the theory underlying the use {{of each of these}} techniques is briefly reviewed and qualitative differences are outlined. SGD represents the sum of hepatic glucogenolysis, gluconeogenesis from amino acids or glycerol, and, according to the glucose tracer used, glucose cycles (glucose-phosphate <b>cycle,</b> fructose-phosphate <b>cycle,</b> <b>Cori</b> and glucose-alanine cycles); systemic delivery of exogenous glucose after oral or i. v. glucose administration is also measured. Net CHOOX represents oxidation of glucose arising from hepatic or muscle glycogen or from exogenous glucose; it {{does not take into account}} oxidation of glucose formed from amino acids or glycerol, which is included in net protein or lipid oxidation. In contrast, isotopic determination of glucose oxidation corresponds to oxidation of glucose originating from hepatic glycogen breakdown, of exogenously administered glucose, and of glucose formed from amino acids and glycerol. Non-oxidative glucose disposal, calculated as SGD-net CHOOX, corresponds to the sum of gluconeogenesis from amino acids or glycerol (which are included in net protein and lipid oxidation), glucose cycles, and glycogen synthesis.

5000|$|The Cahill {{cycle is}} less {{productive}} than the <b>Cori</b> <b>cycle,</b> which uses lactate, since {{a byproduct of}} energy production from alanine is production of urea.
