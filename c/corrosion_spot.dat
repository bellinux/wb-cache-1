40|$|Stainless steels are {{utilized}} for their high toughness {{and resistance to}} general corrosion. Austenitic (300 series) stainless steels {{are the most popular}} because they are ductile and can be easily formed into desired geometries. They can also be case hardened to form alternating layers of martensitic and austenitic microstructures for applications that require high toughness and resistance to surface wear. However their usage is limited in comparison to other ferrous alloys due to higher initial costs and susceptibility to pitting and intergranular (IGC) corrosion. A microcell was developed to study these localized corrosion phenomena in microstructural regions of interest by performing polarization (spot) tests within well defined areas on metallic surfaces. Spot tests across profiles of welded 304 stainless steel confirmed that sensitization, greater acidities and higher chloride contents increase susceptibility and greater additions of chromium and nickel reduce susceptibility to localized <b>corrosion.</b> <b>Spot</b> tests across a case hardened (CSS 42 L) stainless steel profile revealed that the austenitic sensitized outer layer was more susceptible to localized attack compared to the martensitic matrix. A more complete understanding of how microstructure affects these localized corrosion processes will lead to better alloy modifications, service environments and maintenance making this class of material a more sustainable alternative.

40|$|Publicación en versión impresa: Octubre de 2008 Chlorides induce {{localized}} corrosion in the reinforcement. The pits {{formed a}} substantial {{reduction in the}} cross-sectional area. The smaller is the ratio between {{the size of the}} <b>corrosion</b> <b>spot</b> and the surrounding passive metal area acting as cathode, the higher is the corrosion rate or the progression in the pit depth. This, however, is not always the case. To understand well the macro or microcell behavior of the corrosion of reinforcements, this paper reports a study on the effect of decreasing sizes of anodic zones until relatively small, maintaining the size of the cathode constant. In addition, to enhance the pure anodic behavior of the corroding zone, an acidic solution was used as an anolyte. Measuring the galvanic current (Ig) and the corrosion rate (Icorr) by using zero resistance ammeter (ZRA) and polarization resistance (Rp) techniques, respectively, was crucial to differentiate the microcell contribution from that of the macrocell. The results indicate that while Ig increased as the anodic area decreased, Icorr presented a maximum for the area ratios, SA/SC = 1 / 3.

Using this color component, different surface defects such as <b>corrosion</b> <b>spots</b> of different shapes and sizes are automatically detected, within a selected zone, using two different methods depending upon the level of corrosion/defects. The first method relies on a histogram based distribution whereas the second on adaptive thresholds.

Conversion {{treatment for the}} Mg,Al-hydrotalcite conversion coating was as follows. Mg alloy was treated first in acidic HCO(3) (-) /CO(3) (2 -) aqueous for precursor layer formation on Mg alloy surface and then in alkaline HCO(3) (-) /CO(3) (2 -) aqueous to form a crystallized Mg,Al-hydrotalcitc coating. Duration of an Mg,Al-hydrotalcite coating on Mg alloy surface was reduced from 12 h to 4 h by the conversion treatment. On the other hand, for reducing the formation time of CaCO(3) coating on Mg alloy, the aqueous Ca(2 +) /HCO(3) (-) with a saturated Ca(2 +) content was employed for developing a CaCO(3) coating on Mg alloy. A dense CaCO(3) coating could yield on Mg alloy surface in 2 h. Corrosion rate (corrosion current density, J(corr)) of the Mg,Al-hydrotalcite-coated sample and CaCO(3) -coated AZ 91 D sample was 7 - 10 mu A/cm(2), roughly two orders less than the J(corr) of the as-diecast sample (about 200 mu A/cm(2)).

40|$|The {{detection}} of corrosion beneath Space Shuttle Orbiter thermal protective system is traditionally accomplished {{by removing the}} Reusable Surface Insulation tiles and performing a visual inspection of the aluminum substrate and corrosion protection system. This process is time consuming and {{has the potential to}} damage high cost tiles. To evaluate non-intrusive NDE methods, a Proof of Concept (PoC) experiment was designed and test panels were manufactured. The objective of the test plan was three-fold: establish the ability to detect corrosion hidden from view by tiles; determine the key factor affecting detectability; roughly quantify the detection threshold. The plan consisted of artificially inducing dimensionally controlled corrosion spots in two panels and rebonding tile over the spots to model the thermal protective system of the orbiter. The <b>corrosion</b> <b>spot</b> diameter ranged from 0. 100 " to 0. 600 " inches and the depth ranged from 0. 003 " to 0. 020 ". One panel consisted of a complete factorial array of corrosion spots with and without tile coverage. The second panel consisted of randomized factorial points replicated and hidden by tile. Conventional methods such as ultrasonics, infrared, eddy current and microwave methods have shortcomings. Ultrasonics and IR cannot sufficiently penetrate the tiles, while eddy current and microwaves have inadequate resolution. As such, the panels were interrogated using Backscatter Radiography and Terahertz Imaging.

40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringDuring {{the last}} decades {{there have been several}} major ship accidents, and it is {{believed}} that old ships are more unsafe than newer ships. To get a better understanding of this phenomenon the thesis is investigating different issues with ship ageing. This thesis consists of a general description of the most important ageing issues, and the condition of sea water ballast tanks is identified {{as one of the most}} critical issue regarded to ageing on LPG-tankers. This investigation consists of a theoretical description and evaluation of different corrosion mechanisms, fatigue, buckling and steel protection. The different rules and regulation for new build, maintenance and inspection of ballast tanks are discussed, and there have been physical inspections of some ballast tanks on some selected ships (25, 15 and 1 year old ships). A high number of ballast tanks inspection report are reviewed and used as a basis for the conclusions. To demonstrate the importance of proper steel protection, a life time evaluation of critical areas in ballast tanks are carried out. There are five different ageing issues concerning a gas-tanker, seen through a shipping company, as listed below 	Functional ageing 	Technological ageing 	Knowledge based ageing 	Organizational ageing 	Commercial ageing Market related Every one of the ageing mechanisms can affect the lifetime of the ship in different ways. Commercial ageing can be the most fixed ageing mechanism, where the charterer sets a maximum age on ships they will charter. The major oil and gas companies have a maximum age on gas-tankers to be 20 – 25 years old, regardless of the actual condition of the ship. Most of the oil and gas companies require the ships to be in better condition than minimum class requirement, and require ships older than 15 years old to have a Condition Assessment Program – CAP rating of 1 or 2, where CAP 1 is very good condition, CAP 3 is class limit, and CAP 4 is below class limit. Concerning functional ageing, the sea water ballast tanks are a weak link. The ballast tanks have a very corrosive environment with sea water when filled and a humid salty environment when empty. There are (from 2006) strict requirements for coating in ballast tanks called Performance Standard for Protective Coating – PSPC, in addition cathodic protection can be used. This study shows that the top of the wing ballast tanks are the most critical area concerning heavy corrosion in case of coating breakdown. This due to: 	Good supply of oxygen in ballast condition because the tank will in most cases not be filled to the top, and therefore no protection from the offer anodes. 	Moist and salty environment with good supply of oxygen in loaded condition (empty for water) I. e. the cathodic protection is not effective. Rules and regulations require the ship owner to have maintenance and inspection routines of all the important parts of the ship. In Solvang the chief officer inspects all the ballast tanks every 6 th months. The ballast tank inspections that are reviewed show a varying degree of corrosion on the different ships. The maintenance procedures have been updated lately due to problems with coating breakdown shortly after coating maintenance. From the review of the ballast tank condition it seems clear that often the identified corrosion was left unrepaired. The best practice would be to maintain the <b>corrosion</b> <b>spot</b> right away, and prevent the corrosion to expand. If not, the coating will demand more extensive maintenance later. The reasons for postponement of maintenance in ballast tanks can be many. With regard to all the ship accidents that have happened the last 50 years, very few of them are directly caused by ageing mechanisms such as corrosion and fatigue. After MV Flare, MV Erika and MV Prestige which sank in 1998, 1999 and 2002 respectively, there have not (known to the undersigned) been any major ship disasters caused by ageing mechanisms. There have been other accidents such as groundings, collisions and collapse of hull due to bad design, but that type of accidents is not of interest in this thesis. The few accidents in the later years indicates that the rules and requirement regulating the shipping industry (IMO, IACS, class societies, flag state, port control, vetting. etc.) are showing a real effect on the accident rate concerning ageing mechanisms. MV Flare was a bulk carrier, and MV Erika and MV Prestige were oil tankers which sank due to ageing mechanisms. No liquefied gas tankers are known (to undersigned) to sink due to ageing mechanisms. This means that the assumption that an older LPG-tanker may be more unsafe due to ageing not is the case. It is not the age, but the overall condition that decides if the ship is unsafe or not. To evaluate the effect of coating breakdown in ballast tanks some simplified evaluations for buckling capacity and fatigue life were carried out. With localized corrosion that often appears in ballast tanks, the results found showed that the local buckling capacity may be reduced severely in a relatively short period of time. (~ 5 years) Two different approaches for calculating the fatigue life have been used. The calculations show that the approach for offshore structures give approximately 50 % of the fatigue life compared to the ship rules, in corrosive environment. Both methods show that the fatigue life reduces drastically with coating breakdown...|$|E

40|$|Corrosion {{has been}} one of the most serious safety {{problems}} in aviation, and the most costly maintenance problem. Contributing to the problematic nature of corrosion is the complexity of its mechanisms and the randomness with which it occurs. The reliability of a structure affected by corrosion is normally based on the forms of the erosion and its severity. Existing research in this area has a primary focus on corrosion induced structure failure due to inadequate residual structural strength. However, it is valuable to recognise that some product failures induced by corrosion are not critically dependent on stress or fatigue-examples include such cases as leakage from oil pipe or containers, leakage into air cabin and landing floats and, or degradation of a high smooth surface required structure. In such cases non-structural failure should be judged on some specific failure criterion involving the number of <b>corrosion</b> <b>spots,</b> as well as their surface area, depth and distribution.

40|$|Corrosion {{is one of}} the {{industries}} major issues regarding the integrity of assets. Currently inspections are conducted at regular intervals to ensure a sufficient integrity level of these assets. There are many situations where the actual defect location is not accessible, e. g., a pipe support or a partially buried pipe. Last year an approach was presented using a phase inversion of guided waves that propagated around the circumference of a pipe. This approach works well for larger <b>corrosion</b> <b>spots,</b> but shows significant under-sizing of small spots due to lack of sufficient phase rotation. In this paper the use of arrival time and amplitude loss of higher order circumferential passes is evaluated. Using higher order passes increases sensitivity for sizing smaller defects. Different defect profiles are assumed and the change in arrival time and amplitude loss are calculated using a wave equation based approach for different defect widths and depths. This produces a differential travel time and amplitude change map as function of defect depth and defect width. The actually measured travel time change and amplitude change produces two contours in these maps. Calculating the intersection point gives the defect dimensions. The contours for amplitude loss and travel time change are quite orthogonal, this yields a good discrimination between deep and shallow defects. The approach is evaluated using experimental data from different pipes contain artificial and real defects. © 2017 Author(s). QNDE Program...|$|R

The experiments were carried out in simulated pore solutions using electrochemical methods as well as optical microscopy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was mainly used to screen the resistance of different inhibitor systems to compare the efficiency of their inhibition against chloride-induced corrosion. Moreover, corrosion current density and corrosion rates were also calculated for each inhibitor at different chloride concentrations. Cyclic voltammetry (CVA) was conducted to analyze the corrosion process on the steel surface. Pitting potentials as well as repassivation potentials were recorded {{and the difference between}} them was compared. Optical microscopy was used for observing <b>corrosion</b> <b>spots</b> on steel surface at different time during the measurements. From the images and spectra, information can be interpreted as how chloride concentration influenced corrosion rate and to what extent can the four amino acids inhibit corrosion process. In general, pAB had the best inhibition effectiveness among the amino acids, followed by 11 AUA. 6 ACA and Gly showed similar performance during the experiments, both of whose corrosion inhibiting ability were not satisfactory. The difference of corrosion inhibition in amino acids may be owing to their carbon chain length and the existence of functional group.

Due {{to the effect of}} complex stress, high salinity formation water and corrosive medium in oil and gas, the pipe is easy to be corroded. Based on current comparative study of current downhole detection technology, this article points out that MIT+MTT and electromagnetic inspection techniques have better adaptability, more accurate detection ability for <b>spot</b> <b>corrosion</b> (pitting corrosion) of casing on use, crack and uniform corrosion damage, and can be used to monitor the service status of well pipes...|$|R
40|$|In {{times of}} the energy revolution, {{electrochemical}} storage systems gain in importance to balance the fluctuating electricity generation from renewable energies. Dual-ion batteries represent a cost-efficient and environmentally friendly concept for the application as stationary and local energy storage system, because graphite is used as the only material for both electrodes. In these batteries cations and anions of a novel electrolyteintercalate simultaneously into the graphite electrodes. This reversible principle provides a cell voltage above 5 V. However the electrolyte anions (bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide – TFSI-) do not form a passivation layer {{in contact with the}} aluminum current collector. Therefore further oxidation of the metal surface is not prevented and leads to a degradation of the current collector. Since even noble metals like gold are not sufficiently electrochemically stable at such high potentials, the aim is to develop an electronically conductive ceramic layer to prevent the anodic dissolution of the aluminum current collector. The applied sol-gel process is easily scalable and enables the deposition of the selected oxide ceramics using a few coating steps. Necessarily, the deposited thin films need to be thermally treated at a temperature below the melting temperature of aluminum. Therefore aluminum doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) and lanthanum doped strontium titanate (SLT) were selected as materials since they crystallize at low temperatures. The developed sol synthesis routes yielded appropriate sols with good long-term stability and film formation properties. Even on the rough surface of aluminum substrates homogenous coatingswere possible,afteroptimizing the wettability of the surface by a pretreatment. Calcined thin films of both materials showed single phase crystal structures and a crack-free morphology of densely packed particles. However the conductivity of SLT was too lowfor the application as artificial protective coating and this material was not considered further on. Electrochemical measurements showed a significantly reduced anodic dissolution of aluminum for the protected current collector. Furthermore it was observed, that the protection effect increased with the homogeneity of the protection layers. In additional tests,aluminum plates were used to avoid typical crackingeffects of the brittle ceramic protection layer {{at the edge of the}} samples due to mechanical stress. Using this setup, the electrochemical stability of ZnO:Al and the protection effect of the layer was demonstrated by a 120 times reduced anodic dissolution. Herein the occurrence of only few <b>corrosion</b> <b>spots</b> indicated that the corrosive attack of TFSI anions on the aluminum surface was mainly prevented. In conclusion, the developed protection layer will contribute to an improved dual-ion cell by maintaining the contact of the aluminum current collector to the positive electrode...|$|R
50|$|Although several {{international}} conventions against pollution are in place, as of 2003 {{there was still}} no formal body setting international mandatory standards, although the International Safety Guide for Oil Tankers and Terminals (ISGOTT) does provide guidelines giving advise on optimum use and safety, such as recommending that ballast tanks are not entered while loaded with cargo, and that weekly samples are made of the atmosphere inside for hydrocarbon gas. Due to the difficulties of maintenance, ship builders have been competitive in producing double-hulled ships which are easier to inspect, such as ballast and cargo tanks which are easily accessible and easier to <b>spot</b> <b>corrosion</b> in the hull. The Tanker Structure Cooperative Forum (TSCF) published the Guide to Inspection and Maintenance of Double-Hull Tanker Structures in 1995 giving advice based on experience of operating double-hulled tankers.|$|R
40|$|Concentrating {{solar power}} (CSP) {{companies}} have deployed thin-glass mirrors produced by wet-silver processes on ~ 1 -mm-thick, relatively lightweight glass. These mirrors are bonded to metal substrates in commercial installations {{and have the}} confidence of the CSP industry. Initial hemispherical reflectance is ~ 93 %– 96 %, and the cost is ~$ 16. 1 /m 2 –$ 43. 0 /m 2. However, corrosion was observed in mirror elements of operational solar systems deployed outdoors for 2 years. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Advanced Materials Team has been investigating this problem.

40|$|Abstract. The {{plate of}} the heat {{exchanger}} leaked owing to its corrosion during {{the running of the}} whole equipment. The composition of the failure plate, microstructure, corrosion appearance and the chemical composition of the corrosion products were analyzed through Optical microscope, scanning electron microscope and chemical analysis method to find out the reason of the failure. The results show that the chemical composition of the plate meet the requirement of S 31254 (254 SMO) according to standard A 240 /A 240 M- 2005. The main phase was austenite among which the ferrite distributed in stripe. The corrosion happened firstly at the ferrite area under the condition of running medium with chlorine ion and sulfur ion. Incomplete solution of ferrite during the solid solution treatment was the main cause of <b>spot</b> <b>corrosion,</b> which ultimately resulted in the leaking failure owing to the corrosion...|$|R
