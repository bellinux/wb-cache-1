Physical properties of chocolate depend on ingredient composition, method of production and properly performed pre-crystallization phase. In this work, chocolate was produced in an unconventional way, i. e. in a ball mill applying variable refining time (30, 60 and 90 min) and pre-crystallization temperature in chocolate masses (26, 28 and 30 ⁰C). Two types of chocolate were produced: chocolate with 20 % of powdered cow’s milk (R 1) and chocolate with 20 % of soya milk powder (R 2). The quality of chocolate was followed by comparing nutritive composition, 23 polyphenol content, hardness of chocolate, solid triglyceride content (SFC) and rheological parameters (Casson yield flow (Pa), Casson viscosity (Pas), {{the area of the}} thixotropic loop, elastic modulus and creep curves). The aim of this paper is determining changes caused by replacing cow’s milk with soya milk powder in respect of nutritive, rheological and sensory properties, as well as defining optimal parameters: precrystallization temperature and refining time of soya milk chocolate in order to obtain suitable sensory and physical properties identical to those of milk <b>chocolate</b> <b>mass.</b> The results show that replacing powdered cow’s milk with soya milk powder affects the increase in nutritive value of soya milk chocolate. R 2 <b>chocolate</b> <b>mass</b> showed the increase in essential amino acids and fatty acids.

Viscoelastic behavior of R 2 is also evident, as a consequence of soya protein presence. In order to maintain optimal hardness as well as melting resistance of chocolate, in case of R 2 <b>chocolate</b> <b>mass</b> it is necessary to apply pre-crystallization temperature of 26 ⁰C, while for the <b>chocolate</b> <b>mass</b> R 1 it is 30 ⁰C...|$|E

The new manufacturing process rationalises the standard method by combining two phases, namely conching, and refining into a single one.

Introduction: We {{need only}} {{to take a}} short drive through the country to see our present system of making barn yards. Everywhere the {{tendency}} is to crowd everything into as small a space as possible, too often using the fence corner as a machinery shed, or the machinery is cast in some out of the way place where it lies until time to use it again. Not only is room lacking to store machinery but many animals are left out to seek shelter on the leeward side of a tumbling down barb wire fence. Feed, which was gotten after months of toil, expenditure of time and money, and the wearing out of costly machinery, in many cases is left out in the open to receive all the rain and the sunshine until the forage is unfit for consumption by animals. I have one yard in mind, and this {{is not the only one}} I am sorry to say, which is one of the dirtiest yards when it comes a "wet spell". You wade around shoe top deep, in a slushy, soft, sort of a <b>chocolate</b> colored <b>mass</b> surrounding the barn for several yards as a result of throwing manure out of openings back of the horses, made for the purpose, or out of the nearest opening that is handy.

Measurements on texture and surface whiteness showed initial rapid increases with consequential reductions in gloss within the first 96 h, followed by gradually decreasing gradient until reaching asymptotic levels. Storage influenced melting properties (Tonset, Tend, Tpeak and ΔHmelt) in products causing polymorphic transformation from βIV to βVI within 72 h. Micrographs showed similar surface crystalline network structure and inter-particle interactions among products from different PS after tempering, and bloom initiation occurred within 24 h in storage resulting in appearance of both liquid and unstable fat {{on the surface of}} products.

All suspensions showed shear thinning behaviour at volume fractions > 0. 2, where side stream materials showed lower shear thinning behaviour than sucrose.

The rheological behaviour of the fibre-rich materials suspended in MCT is explained by the effective volume of the irregularly shaped particles. The behaviour of sucrose suspensions is explained by the formation of aggregates, which seem to be promoted by water bridges between the particles. Overall, the behaviour of the sucrose dispersions was very different compared to the other materials with respect to the shear thinning behaviour, the impact of lecithin as well as the impact of water.
