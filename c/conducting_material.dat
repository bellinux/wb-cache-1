5|$|One {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the planets is their intrinsic magnetic moments, which in turn give rise to magnetospheres. The presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive. In other words, magnetized planets have flows of electrically <b>conducting</b> <b>material</b> in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields. These fields significantly change {{the interaction of the}} planet and solar wind. A magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called the magnetosphere, which the wind cannot penetrate. The magnetosphere can be much larger than the planet itself. In contrast, non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the ionosphere with the solar wind, which cannot effectively protect the planet.|$|E

5|$|Study {{has shown}} that the origin of charge is from certain types of {{subatomic}} particles which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a <b>conducting</b> <b>material,</b> such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>conducting</b> <b>materials</b> on the {{correlation}} of furan concentration in transformer oil and its spectral response characteristics. The presence of furan derivatives in aged-transformer oil {{has been one of}} the key indicators for solid dielectric deterioration. Identification and quantification of furan derivatives are currently performed using high performance liquid chromatography or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based on ASTM D 5837 standard. Although these techniques are well established, they need an expert personal to conduct the test and to analyse its results. Moreover, the test is relatively expensive and the analysis of oil sample may take days as most utilities sending transformer oil samples to external laboratories to be tested. Recently, it has been proven that furan concentration in transformer oil has a strong correlation to the oil spectral response. This paper is to validate this finding and to investigate {{the impact of}} <b>conducting</b> <b>materials</b> within transformer oil on this correlation. In this context, extensive experimental tests are conducted to assess the impact of various concentration of <b>conducting</b> <b>materials</b> (e. g., copper dust) dissolved in transformer oil samples of different furan contents on its absorption and transmission spectra. The measured experimental results show that, the impact of such small amount ofdissolved <b>conducting</b> <b>materials</b> on the oil spectral response is minimal...|$|R

25|$|Substances {{in which}} {{electricity}} can flow are called conductors. A piece of <b>conducting</b> <b>material</b> {{of a particular}} resistance meant {{for use in a}} circuit is called a resistor. Conductors are made of high-conductivity materials such as metals, in particular copper and aluminium.

25|$|If {{the walls}} of the {{accelerating}} cavities are made of normally <b>conducting</b> <b>material</b> and the accelerating fields are large, the wall resistivity converts electric energy into heat quickly. On the other hand, superconductors also need constant cooling to keep them below their critical temperature, and the accelerating fields are limited by quenches. Therefore, high energy accelerators such as SLAC, still the longest in the world (in its various generations), are run in short pulses, limiting the average current output and forcing the experimental detectors to handle data coming in short bursts.|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} of surface breaking defects in <b>conducting</b> <b>materials</b> {{is an important}} aspect of nondestructive evaluation (NDE). Eddy current NDE methods have been used effectively for the {{detection of}} fatigue cracks and other surface breaking flaws in <b>conducting</b> <b>materials</b> [1], however, a detracting characteristic is that the eddy current transducer must be placed in close proximity to the test specimen. Since millimeter wave energy can propagate in air and does not require a couplant, millimeter wave NDE offers an alternative technique with the significant advantage of detection in a stand off mode of operation. Millimeter wave NDE {{has been shown to be}} effective at detecting small cracks [2 – 3], however, some methods under study require that the transducer be in close proximity with the specimen and thus suffer from the same disadvantages as eddy current techniques.

25|$|Metals {{and other}} solid {{materials}} expand upon heating and contract upon cooling. This is an undesirable occurrence in electrical systems. Copper {{has a low}} {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} for an electrical <b>conducting</b> <b>material.</b> Aluminium, an alternate common conductor, expands nearly one third more than copper under increasing temperatures. This higher degree of expansion, along with aluminium’s lower ductility, can cause electrical problems when bolted connections are improperly installed.

25|$|While quantum {{mechanics}} primarily {{applies to the}} smaller atomic regimes of matter and energy, some systems exhibit quantum mechanical effects on a large scale.

So is the closely related phenomenon of superconductivity, the frictionless flow of an electron gas in a <b>conducting</b> <b>material</b> (an electric current) at sufficiently low temperatures. The fractional quantum Hall effect is a topological ordered state which corresponds to patterns of long-range quantum entanglement. States with different topological orders (or different patterns of long range entanglements) cannot change into each other without a phase transition.|$|E
25|$|Biological {{tissue is}} often {{embedded}} in a resin block then thinned to less than 100nm on an ultramicrotome. The resin block is fractured as it passes over a glass or diamond knife edge. This method is used to obtain thin, minimally deformed samples that allow for the observation of tissue ultrastructure. Inorganic samples, such as aluminium, may also be embedded in resins and ultrathin sectioned in this way, using either coated glass, sapphire or larger angle diamond knives.

Generally, the thicker the interface layer, especially in the base of the pan, the more improved the heat distribution. Claims of thermal efficiency improvements are, however, controversial, owing in particular to the limiting and heat-banking effect of stainless steel on thermal flows.|$|E

2500|$|In 1821, Thomas Johann Seebeck {{discovered}} that a thermal gradient formed between two dissimilar conductors produces a voltage. [...] At {{the heart of the}} thermoelectric effect is the fact that a temperature gradient in a <b>conducting</b> <b>material</b> results in heat flow; this results in the diffusion of charge carriers. The flow of charge carriers between the hot and cold regions in turn creates a voltage difference. In 1834, Jean Charles Athanase Peltier {{discovered that}} running an electric current through the junction of two dissimilar conductors could, depending on the direction of the current, cause it to act as a heater or cooler. The heat absorbed or produced is proportional to the current, and the proportionality constant is known as the Peltier coefficient. Today, due to knowledge of the Seebeck and Peltier effects, thermoelectric materials can be used as heaters, coolers and generators (TEGs).|$|E
2500|$|Nonconductive {{specimens}} collect charge when scanned by {{the electron}} beam, {{and especially in}} secondary electron imaging mode, this causes scanning faults and other image artifacts. For conventional imaging in the SEM, specimens must be electrically conductive, {{at least at the}} surface, and electrically grounded to prevent the accumulation of electrostatic charge.

Conductive materials in current use for specimen coating include gold, gold/palladium alloy, platinum, iridium, tungsten, chromium, osmium, and graphite.
