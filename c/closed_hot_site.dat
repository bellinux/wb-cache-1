5000|$|A <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> is a {{duplicate}} {{of the original}} site of the organization, with full computer systems as well as near-complete backups of user data. Real time synchronization between the two sites {{may be used to}} completely mirror the data environment of the original site using wide area network links and specialized software. Following a disruption to the original <b>site,</b> the <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> exists so that the organization can relocate with minimal losses to normal operations in the shortest recovery time. Ideally, a <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> will be up and running within a matter of hours. Personnel may have to be moved to the <b>hot</b> <b>site,</b> but {{it is possible that the}} <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> may be operational from a data processing perspective before staff has relocated. The capacity of the <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> may or may not match the capacity of the original site depending on the organization's requirements. This type of backup site is the most expensive to operate. <b>Hot</b> <b>sites</b> are popular with organizations that operate real time processes such as financial institutions, government agencies and eCommerce providers.The most important feature offered from a <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> is that the production environment(s) is running concurrently with the main datacenter. This syncing allows for minimal impact and downtime to business operations. In the event of a significant outage event, the <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> can take the place of the impacted site immediately. However, this level of redundancy does not come cheap, and businesses will have to weigh the cost-benefit-analysis (CBA) of <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> utilization.Nowadays if the backup site is down and misses the [...] "proactive" [...] approach it may not be considered a <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> depending on the level of maturity of the organization regarding the ISO 22301 approach (international standard for Business Continuity Management).|$|R

40|$|Monthly cruises {{have been}} made to the <b>HOT</b> <b>site</b> (approximately 100 km north of Oahu) since October 1988. The goal of these cruises is to make hydrography, chemistry, and biology observations. Measurements are {{typically}} made at a near coastal station (Kahe) on the first day to test the equipment and to obtain coastal shallow water (approximately 1500 m) observations. The second and third days are spent at the <b>HOT</b> <b>site.</b> On the morning of the fourth day, measurements are made at the <b>HOT</b> <b>site</b> and noontime measurements are made at the Hale-Aloha station near the mooring before returning to port by early the next morning. The locations of the three stations are Kahe, HOT, and Hale-ALOHA buoy. The routine HOT measurements are available during the summer following the year of the observations. The 1998 measurements will therefore become available during the summer of 1999. The data sets can be obtained at the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) or from the <b>HOT</b> web <b>site</b> [URL]...|$|R

50|$|As {{awareness}} of the potential business disruption that would follow an IT-related disaster, the disaster recovery industry developed to provide backup computer centers, with Sun Information Systems (which later became Sungard Availability Services) becoming the first major US commercial <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> vendor, established in 1978 in Sri Lanka.|$|R
50|$|Choosing {{the type}} of backup site to be used is decided by an {{organizations}} based on a cost vs. benefit analysis. <b>Hot</b> <b>sites</b> are traditionally more expensive than cold sites, since much of the equipment the company needs must be purchased and thus people are needed to maintain it, making the operational costs higher. However, if the same organization loses {{a substantial amount of}} revenue for each day they are inactive, then it may be worth the cost. Another advantage of a <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> is that it can be used for operations prior to a disaster happening. This load balanced production processing method can be cost effective, and will provide the users with the security of minimal downtime during an event that affects one of the data centers.|$|R
50|$|Alternatives, {{dependent}} upon {{the evaluation of the}} computer function, may include: <b>hot</b> <b>sites,</b> warm sites, cold sites, reciprocal agreements, the provision of more than one data center, the installation and deployment of multiple computer system, duplication of service center, consortium arrangements, lease of equipment, and any combinations of the above.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, the Zone of Influence was {{historically}} {{measured as}} anywhere within 100m {{of the boundary}} of the high voltage compound at a <b>Hot</b> <b>Site.</b> Since 2007, it is allowable to use the Energy Networks Association (ENA) Recommendation S34 [...] ('A Guide for Assessing the Rise of Earth Potential at Substation Sites') to calculate Hot Zone. This is now defined as a contour line marking where the Rise Of Earth Potential (ROEP) exceeds 430V for normal reliability power lines or 650V for high reliability lines. The Zone extends in a radius from any bonded metalwork such as the site earth electrode system and boundary fence. This may effectively reduce the overall size of the Hot Zone. However, strip earth electrodes, and any non-effectively insulated metallic sheath/ armouring of power cables which extend out of this zone {{would continue to be}} considered as 'hot' for a distance of 100m from the boundary, for a width of two meters either side of the conductor. It {{is the responsibility of the}} owning Electrical Supply Industry (ESI) to calculate the Hot Zone. Openreach (a BT Group company tasked with installing and maintaining the majority of telephone services in the UK) maintains a <b>Hot</b> <b>Site</b> Register, updated every 12 months by voluntarily supplied information from the ESI companies in the UK. Any Openreach engineer working in such an area must be <b>Hot</b> <b>Site</b> trained.|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} minimal model {{calculations}} {{indicate that the}} stability and the kinetic accessibility of the native state of small globular proteins are controlled by few “hot” sites. By means of molecular dynamics simulations around the native conformation, which describe the protein and the surrounding solvent at the all-atom level, an accurate and compact energetic map of the native state of the protein is generated. This map is further simplified {{by means of an}} eigenvalue decomposition. The components of the eigenvector associated with the lowest eigenvalue indicate which <b>hot</b> <b>sites</b> are likely to be responsible for the stability and for the rapid folding of the protein.

40|$|In this article, we have {{compared}} the metal-amino acid interactions in Tyr-Ag and Phe-Ag complexes through pH dependent SERS measurements. By analyzing {{the variation in}} relative intensities of SERS bands with the pH of the amino acid solution, we have obtained the orientation and conformation of the amino acid molecules on the Ag surface. The results obtained from our experimental studies are supported by the the energy minimized strucutres and the observed charge distributions in different terminals of the molecules. This, in a way, shows that SERS measurements not only exhibit {{the interaction of the}} amino acid molecules with Ag clusters but also demonstrate their orientation around it. We have addressed a long standing query on whether the amine group is directly attached with Ag surface along with the carboxylate group and π-electrons in these systems. In addition, pH dependent optical absorption and transmission electron microscopy measurements have been performed to understand the required conditions for the appearance of the SERS spectra {{in the light of the}} aggregation of metal particles and the number of <b>hot</b> <b>sites</b> in the sol. Our results confirm that the formation of <b>hot</b> <b>sites</b> in the sol plays a direct role to form a stable Ag-ligand complex. Furthermore, the interaction kinetics of metal-amino acid complexes have been analyzed via both Raman and absorption measurements. Comment: 15 pages 18 figure...|$|R
