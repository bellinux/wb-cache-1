The autonomous mps consisting of different microsystems is placed between the robot's hand and the gripper. The static positioning and feeding displacements {{as well as the}} tolerances of the object's dimensions and the dynamic robot vibrations are sensed with the mps's miniature sensor system. The <b>correction</b> <b>movement</b> is done by the mps's micro piezo actuators. Thus reaching an accuracy of about 10 microns and a reduction of the mounting cycle time. The high precision can be reached because the mps is focused on the movement of the object to be mounted and the position of the target. The mps is a flexible system, that can be used with different kind of robots, because neither the robot's control system nor the robot itself has to be changed...|$|E

K. D. Ushinsky, Odessa, Ukraine Abstract This article deals with the problem of determining the effectiveness of the method Bobath, as the main methods of psychophysical condition correction of children with movement disorders. Given the drawbacks of the proposed test detailed rating scale of psychomotor development of children "Map test of motor abilities of children" was adapted and implemented together with the Munich diagnostic testing cards of mental skills and motor abilities of children. The basis of the experiment became the evaluation of basic motor skills in certain positions and determine the true psychophysical age at the beginning and at the end of the course on corrective exercises by Bobath method. Considering the universality, accessibility of data and informative test quality it became possible to assess the stages of psychomotor development and mental qualities forming with the true definition of real psychophysical children age with movement disorders 3 - 4 years.

40|$|Movements aimed towards objects {{occasionally}} have to {{be adjusted}} when the object moves. These online adjustments can be very rapid, occurring {{in as little as}} 100 ms. More is known about the latency and neural basis of online control of movements to visual than to auditory target objects. We examined the latency of online corrections in reaching-to-point movements to visual and auditory targets that could change side and/or modality at movement onset. Visual or auditory targets were presented on the left or right sides, and participants were instructed to reach and point to them as quickly and as accurately as possible. On half of the trials, the targets changed side at movement onset, and participants had to correct their movements to point to the new target location as quickly as possible. Given different published approaches to measuring the latency for initiating movement corrections, we examined several different methods systematically. What we describe here as the optimal methods involved fitting a straight-line model to the velocity of the <b>correction</b> <b>movement,</b> rather than using a statistical criterion to determine correction onset. In the multimodal experiment, these model-fitting methods produced significantly lower latencies for correcting movements away from the auditory targets than away from the visual targets. Our results confirm that rapid online correction is possible for auditory targets, but further work is required to determine whether the underlying control system for reaching and pointing movements is the same for auditory and visual targets...|$|E

40|$|Humans {{are highly}} skilled in {{controlling}} their reaching movements, making fast and task-dependent <b>movement</b> <b>corrections</b> to unforeseen perturbations. To guide these corrections, the neural control system requires a continuous, instantaneous {{estimate of the}} current state of the arm and body in the world. According to Optimal Feedback Control theory, this estimate is multimodal and constructed based on the integration of forward motor predictions and sensory feedback, such as proprioceptive, visual and vestibular information, modulated by context, and shaped by past experience. But how can a multimodal estimate drive fast <b>movement</b> <b>corrections,</b> given that the involved sensory modalities have different processing delays, different coordinate representations, and different noise levels? We develop the hypothesis that the earliest online <b>movement</b> <b>corrections</b> are based on multiple single modality state estimates rather than one combined multimodal estimate. We review studies that have investigated online multimodal integration for reach control and offer suggestions for experiments to test for the existence of intramodal state estimates. If proven true, the framework of Optimal Feedback Control needs to be extended with a stage of intramodal state estimation, serving to drive short-latency <b>movement</b> <b>corrections...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{privatization}} of <b>corrections</b> <b>movement</b> has accelerated. From 1995 to 2000, the number of private adult prisons increased from roughly two dozen to more one-hundred. Today, privately operated prisons hold more than 95, 000 state and federal inmates, roughly 7 {{percent of the total}} inmate population in the United States. Fueling this trend is the belief that private competitive markets can reduce the costs of incarceration, all the while complying with constitutionally mandated standards of inmate care and custody. However, research comparing the efficiency and effectiveness of private and public prisons has produced mixed results. This study attempts to provide additional insights into the privatization debate. Bivariate and multivariate analyses are used to assess the relative effectiveness of private prisons in maintaining institutional order and providing inmate programming. This study will also explore shifts in the relative performance of private prisons over time...|$|R

Based on ray-tracing simulation, the assembly system carries out the {{alignment of}} optics automatically. During the alignment process the laser beam is monitored and analysed. The ray-tracing simulation is updated in a closed-loop manner for gaining information on required <b>correction</b> <b>movements.</b> This information is passed to the assembly system in order to achieve a valid optical function using tolerance-affected components. The choice of metrology as well as the interfaces between different software packages and hardware components will be discussed.

The transfer function was calibrated at a time when no signal was applied. Corrections were made by subtracting predicted magnetic field variations using the transfer function based on the movement measured by the gyro from the observed magnetic field variations, yielding data free of motion noise.

40|$|Intraoperative {{dosimetry}} {{of prostate}} brachytherapy can help optimize the dose distribution and potentially improve clinical outcome. Evaluation of dose distribution during the seed implant procedure requires {{the knowledge of}} 3 D seed coordinates. Fluoroscopy-based seed localization is a viable option. From three x-ray projections obtained at different gantry angles, 3 D seed positions can be determined. However, when local anaesthesia is used for prostate brachytherapy, the patient movement during fluoroscopy image capture becomes a practical problem. If uncorrected, the errors introduced by patient motion between image captures would cause seed mismatches. Subsequently, the seed reconstruction algorithm would either fail to reconstruct or yield erroneous results. We have developed an algorithm that permits detection and <b>correction</b> of patient <b>movement</b> that may occur between fluoroscopy image captures. The patient movement is decomposed into translational shifts along the tabletop and rotation about an axis perpendicular to the tabletop. The property of spatial invariance of the co-planar imaging geometry is used for lateral <b>movement</b> <b>correction.</b> Cranio-caudal <b>movement</b> is corrected by analysing the perspective invariance along the x-ray axis. Rotation is estimated by an iterative method. The method can detect and correct for the range of patient movement commonly seen in the clinical environment.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability of}} human and {{non-human}} primates to make fast <b>corrections</b> to hand <b>movement</b> trajectories after a sudden shift in the target’s location is a key feature of visuo-motor behavior. In healthy individuals, hand movements smoothly adapt {{to a change in}} target location without needing to complete the movement to the first target location, as typical of parietal patients. This finding indicates that the nervous system continuously monitors the visual scene and is able to integrate new information in order to produce an efficient motor response. In this paper, we review the kinematics, reaction times and muscle activity observed during the online <b>correction</b> of hand <b>movements</b> as well as the underlying neurophysiological processes studied through single-cell neural recordings in monkeys. Brain stimulation, lesion and imaging studies in humans are also discussed. We demonstrate that while online correction mechanisms strongly depend on the activity of a parieto-frontal network of which the posterior parietal cortex is a crucial node, these mechanisms proceed smoothly and are similar to what is observed during simple point-to-point <b>movements.</b> Online <b>correction</b> of hand <b>movements</b> would rely on feedforward and feedback mechanisms in the parietal cortex, as part of the activity within the fronto-parietal network for the planning and execution of visuo-motor tasks...|$|R

Following this, the influence of different jerk values on surface topography and roughness has been investigated {{with a set of}} experiments. Secondly, the demands on the design of machine tool frames for the realisation of high jerk values are discussed and a new concept for micro milling machine tool frames is proposed. The concept is based on a mechanical structure as the frame, which is of a stiff design in the direction perpendicular to the respective machine tool axis and of a compliant design {{in the direction of the}} respective machine tool axis. The compliancy allows for compensation of the dynamic dislocation by use of <b>correction</b> <b>movements</b> of the machine tool axes. An open control system is used capable of integrating complex models of the mechanical structure.

30|$|Whereas {{significant}} ventricular enlargement and cerebral {{cortical atrophy}} are a well-replicated observation in schizophrenia, {{these changes are}} usually small and require large sample sizes for detection [64, 65]. Hence, the present findings in healthy volunteers should be applicable in schizophrenia research. Importantly, our results do not support a role for different ROI delineation methods as an explanation for discrepant results in studies on D 1 -R in drug-naïve schizophrenia. In contrast, the present increase in BPND in putamen and DLPFC with improved absolute variability after realignment may be more relevant. In studies in drug-naïve samples, Okubo et al. found lower D 1 -R in the frontal cortex in patients, whereas Abi-Dargham and colleagues found higher levels [5, 6] and Karlsson et al. found no significant differences, although D 1 -R was numerically higher with an effect size of 0.3 in the frontal cortex [8, 13]. Across all of these papers, <b>movement</b> <b>correction</b> is only described in the 2002 study by Abi-Dargham et al. [5], but no information is provided in the 2012 paper [6]. Although both our previous and the present studies employed head fixation to minimize head movement, the present {{results show that the}} absence of <b>movement</b> <b>correction</b> may still produce both lower BPND and lower reliability. It {{should be noted that the}} magnitude of change in BPND values following <b>movement</b> <b>correction</b> would not be sufficiently large to explain the differences in the direction of the reported clinical findings. However, it may be speculated that movement artifacts may have occurred more commonly among patients than healthy volunteers and subsequently biased the results.|$|R

40|$|Modulation of frontal midline theta (fmθ) is {{observed}} during error commission, but {{little is known}} about the role of theta oscillations in correcting motor behaviours. We investigate EEG activity of healthy partipants executing a reaching task under variable degrees of prism-induced visuo-motor distortion and visual occlusion of the initial arm trajectory. This task introduces directional errors of different magnitudes. The discrepancy between predicted and actual movement directions (i. e. the error), at the time when visual feedback (hand appearance) became available, elicits a signal that triggers on-line <b>movement</b> <b>correction.</b> Analysis were performed on 25 EEG channels. For each participant, the median value of the angular error of all reaching trials was used to partition the EEG epochs into high- and low-error conditions. We computed event-related spectral perturbations (ERSP) time-locked either to visual feedback or to the onset of <b>movement</b> <b>correction.</b> ERSP time-locked to the onset of visual feedback showed that fmθ increased in the high- but not in the low-error condition with an approximate time lag of 200 ms. Moreover, when single epochs were sorted by the degree of motor error, fmθ started to increase when a certain level of error was exceeded and, then, scaled with error magnitude. When ERSP were time-locked to the onset of <b>movement</b> <b>correction,</b> the fmθ increase anticipated this event with an approximate time lead of 50 ms. During successive trials, an error reduction was observed which was associated with indices of adaptations (i. e., aftereffects) suggesting the need to explore if theta oscillations may facilitate learning. To our knowledge this is the first study where the EEG signal recorded during reaching movements was time-locked to the onset of the error visual feedback. This allowed us to conclude that theta oscillations putatively generated by anterior cingulate cortex activation are implicated in error processing in semi-naturalistic motor behaviours...|$|R
