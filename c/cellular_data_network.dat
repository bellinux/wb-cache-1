We propose a cooperative parallel file downloading scheme to reduce latency in <b>cellular</b> <b>data</b> <b>networks.</b> Mobile nodes form a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) via their IEEE 802. 11 based links to share their cellular link capacity. A file is split into pieces and downloaded simultaneously by the client and several neighbor nodes that act as relay proxies. The proxies then use the MANET to forward packets to the client. Thus, the client uses multiple paths for parallel downloading. No special hardware or modifications on the base stations are needed. An on-demand proxy discovery algorithm is proposed for fast and efficient proxy discovery. Experimental and simulation results show that cooperative parallel file downloading may significantly improve cellular network utilization and file download performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—It is not {{uncommon}} for the uplink buffers of <b>cellular</b> <b>data</b> <b>networks</b> to be saturated when the uplink bandwidths are low. This can cause the ACK packets for a downlink TCP flow to be severely delayed. Since existing TCP implementations are ACK-clocked, the downstream flow will suffer significant degradation, causing the downlink to be under-utilized. We present a new TCP variant, called TCP Receiver-Rate Estimation (TCP-RRE), that addresses this problem directly by eliminating ACK clocking. Instead, it uses TCP timestamps to estimate the receiving rate at the receiver, which it then uses to determine the sending rate. We show that TCP-RRE is able to improve download speeds by 2 to 4 times compared to existing TCP variants in both simulation and on real commercial <b>cellular</b> <b>data</b> <b>networks.</b> Our solution is practical because it is compatible with existing TCP implementations, requires no modifications to existing mobile devices, and is thus immediately deployable in existing ISP proxies.

40|$|We {{address the}} {{transmission}} of data packets from base stations to mobile terminals in a one-dimensional cel-lular network. The probability that a data packet suc-cessfully arrives at the destined mobile terminal highly depends on the activity of nearby co-channel base sta-tions. Motivated by favorable results from earlier stud-ies we consider a network in which all base stations use the same radio channel. Packets lost because of mutual interference are retransmitted with a random backoff mechanism. Recursive arguments are applied for the calculation the mean time necessary for a base station to deliver the packet, provided that in an initial state all stations have packet to transmit. The average de-livery time, maximized over all base station locations, is also analyzed.

Dy-namic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) and WebRTC are new and evolving standards that have been developed specifically to meet this demand and enable a high-quality experience for mobile users of video on demand and real time communication services, respectively. However, there has been no systematic study of how these services are experienced by users in a realistic mobile setting.
