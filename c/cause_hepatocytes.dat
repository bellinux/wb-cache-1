For instance, acetaminophen is a well-known liver toxicant, acetaminophen-treated liver cells showed the significant increased ROS production and glutathione depletion, <b>cause</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> toxicity and death [28]. Pentachlorophenol, a pesticides, may cause high toxicological impact in hepatocytes with the involvement of ROS overproduction and oxidative stress. Antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and quercetin may modulate the toxicity effects of Pentachlorophenol [29]. Metal pollutants such as Aluminum may generate intracellular ROS and triggers a metabolic shift towards lipogenesis in astrocytes and hepatocytes. ROS activation is associated with impaired mitochondrial activity, anaerobiosis and the channeling of α-ketoacids towards anti-oxidant defense. These process leads {{to a reduction in}} ATP synthesis, were potential cause of brain and liver disorders [30]. The ROS induced cell toxicity have been revealed by temporal imaging.

40|$|AbstractAs {{part of this}} {{thematic}} {{series on}} mitochondria in cell death, {{we would like to}} review our data on: (1) the role of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) in hepatocyte necrosis during cholestasis; and (2) the concept that endogenous mitochondrial protease activity may lead to the MPT. Many chronic human liver diseases are characterized by cholestasis, an impairment in bile flow. During cholestasis an accumulation of toxic hydrophobic bile salts in the <b>hepatocyte</b> <b>causes</b> necrosis. We tested the hypothesis that toxic hydrophobic bile salt, glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC), <b>causes</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> necrosis by inducing the MPT. GCDC induces a rapid, cyclosporin A-sensitive MPT. The hydrophilic bile salt, ursodeoxycholate (UDCA), prevents the GCDC-induced MPT and hepatocyte necrosis providing an explanation for its beneficial effect in human liver disease. We have also demonstrated that the calcium-dependent MPT is associated with an increase in calpain-like protease activity and inhibited by calpain inhibitors. In an experimental model of cholestasis, mitochondrial calpain-like protease activity increases 1. 6 -fold. We propose {{for the first time that}} activation of mitochondrial proteases may initiate the MPT and cell necrosis during cholestasis...|$|R

Unfortunately, TZDs are associated with sporadic hepatic dysfunction that is not predictable from experimental animal studies. We investigated the response of isolated rat and human hepatocytes to various TZDs using biochemical assays, coherent multiprobe fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analyses. The results identified direct effects of TZD on mitochondria from live human and rodent hepatocytes. The multiprobe fluorescence assays showed disruption of mitochondrial activity as an initiating event followed by increased membrane permeability, calcium influx and nuclear condensation. Other TZD-related cellular effects were increased hepatic enzyme leakage, decreased reductive metabolism and cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphate depletion. Mitochondrial effects were similar in cryopreserved hepatocytes from diabetic or non-diabetic donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) had baseline mitochondrial energetics and metabolism comparable with isolated hepatocytes. Mitochondrial effects in isolated hepatocytes were found in human PBMCs exposed to the TZDs.

40|$|AbstractReperfusion injury {{represents}} an important cause of primary graft non-function during liver transplantation. However, the mechanism responsible for cellular damage during reoxygenation {{has not yet}} been completely understood. We have investigated whether changes in intracellular Na+ distribution might contribute to <b>cause</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> damage during reoxygenation buffer after 24 h of cold storage. Hepatocyte reoxygenation resulted in a rapid increase in cellular Na+ content that was associated with cytotoxicity. Na+ accumulation and hepatocyte death were prevented by the omission of Na+ from the incubation medium, but not by the addition of antioxidants. Blocking Na+/H+ exchanger and Na+/HCO 3 − co-transporter by, respectively, 5 -(N,N-dimethyl) -amiloride or omitting HCO 3 − from the reoxygenation medium significantly decreased Na+ overload and cytotoxicity. Stimulation of ATP re-synthesis by the addition of fructose also lowered Na+ accumulation and cell death during reoxygenation. A significant protection against Na+-mediated reoxygenation injury was evident in hepatocytes maintained in an acidic buffer (pH 6. 5) or in the presence of glycine. The cytoprotective action of glycine or of the acidic buffer was reverted by promoting Na+ influx with the Na+/H+ ionophore monensin. Altogether, these results suggest that Na+ accumulation during the early phases of reoxygenation might contribute to liver graft reperfusion injury...|$|R

30|$|The {{biochemical}} markers used {{to assess}} liver function were ALT and AST which are the most sensible biomarkers promptly involved in the extent of hepatocellular injury (Chun, Tong, Busuttil, & Hiatt, 2009; Singh, Bhat, & Sharma, 2011) and their increase in serum is a marker of cellular outflow and lack of the functional integrity of cell membranes of hepatocytes (Rajesh & Latha, 2004). The current investigations further showed that levels of serum ALT and AST were markedly changed by administration of Diclo, Ibu, or Para depending on dose and drug type. The present study draws a parallel with the research work of Bessone (2010) and Kishida et al.

Further, paracetamol is metabolized into a toxic reactive metabolite that binds to and depletes glutathione in the hepatocytes resulting in the impairment of mitochondrial function <b>causing</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> damage and necrosis. And this damage leads to cellular leakage and loss of functional integrity of cell membrane in liver releasing high levels of serum markers in the blood, notably AST and ALT that represents 90 % of total enzyme and better index of liver injury (Watkins & Seef, 2006; Ansari & Asif, 2012).|$|R
40|$|Amatoxin {{poisoning}} {{is caused}} by mushroom species belonging to the genera Amanita, Galerina and Lepiota {{with the majority of}} lethal mushroom exposures attributable to Amanita phalloides. High mortality rate in intoxications with these mushrooms is principally a result of the acute liver failure following significant hepatocyte damage due to hepatocellular uptake of amatoxins. A wide variety of amatoxins have been isolated; however, alpha-amanitin (alpha-AMA) appears to be the primary toxin. Studies in vitro and in vivo suggest that alpha-AMA does not only <b>cause</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> necrosis, but also may lead to apoptotic cell death. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the complex hepatocyte apoptosis in alpha-AMA cytotoxicity. All experiments were performed on primary cultured canine hepatocytes. The cells were incubated for 12 h with alpha-AMA at a final concentration of 1, 5, 10 and 20 microM. Viability test (MTT assay), apoptosis evaluation (TUNEL reaction, detection of DNA laddering and electron microscopy) were performed at 6 and 12 h of exposure to alpha-AMA. There was a clear correlation between hepatocyte viability, concentration of alpha-AMA and time of exposure to this toxin. The decline in cultured dog hepatocyte viability during the exposure to alpha-AMA is most likely preceded by enhanced cellular apoptosis.

Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is a key antigen that is critically involved in HBV-associated liver diseases. However, the molecular basis for its pathogenesis, particularly in liver damage, has not been well defined. Herein, we report that HBx was able to enhance the susceptibility of hepatocytes to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) -induced apoptosis. Increased sensitivity to TRAIL was associated with HBx-induced upregulation of miR- 125 a, which, in turn, suppressed the expression of its putative target gene, A 20 E 3 ligase. Importantly, we demonstrate that the defective expression of A 20 impaired the K 63 -linked polyubiquitination of caspase- 8, which reciprocally enhanced the activation of caspase- 8, the recruitment of Fas-associated death domain (FADD), {{and the formation of}} death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), thereby promoting HBx-mediated apoptotic signaling. Accordingly, antagonizing miR- 125 a or ectopically expressing A 20 in hepatocytes abolished the pro-apoptotic effect of HBx. Conversely, the overexpression of miR- 125 a or knockdown of A 20 mimicked HBx to enhance TRAIL susceptibility in hepatocytes. Thus, we establish, for the first time, a miR- 125 a/A 20 -initiated and caspase- 8 -targeted mechanism by which HBx modulates apoptotic signaling and increases hepatic susceptibility to the damaging agent, which might provide novel insight into HBV-related liver pathology...|$|R

This study was aimed to test if cytotoxicity of these compounds is mediated through mitochondria dysfunction. Bile acids effects on isolated rat liver mitochondrial were analyzed by monitoring changes in membrane potential and mitochondrial respiration, as well as alterations in H+ membrane permeability and mitochondrial permeability transition pore induction. Increasing concentrations of the bile acids litocholic (LCA), deoxycholic (DCA), ursodeoxycholic (UDCA), chenodeoxycholic (CDCA), glycochenodeoxycholic (GCDC), or taurochenodeoxycholic (TCDC) decrease transmembrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}) developed upon succinate energization. These compounds also decreased state 3 respiration and enhanced state 4. We have also demonstrated that the observed concentration-dependent stimulation of state 4 by LCA, DCA, CDCA, TCDC, and GCDC, is associated with an enhanced permeability of mitochondria to H+. Addition of LCA, DCA, CDCA, TCDC, GCDC, and UDCA to mitochondria energized with succinate resulted in a dose-dependent membrane depolarization and stimulation of mitochondrial permeability transition. Tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) elicited no significant effect on succinate-supported mitochondrial bioenergetics. In contrast, {{in the presence of}} glycoursodeoxycholic (GUDC), {Delta}{Psi} increases as a function of bile salt concentration.

To better {{understand}} the molecular basis of this novel interaction, we compared the binding of lactoferrin and asialo-orosomucoid (ASOR) to isolated rat hepatocytes and to purified ASGP receptors {{as a function of}} pH, Ca(2 +) and receptor acylation. Binding of (125) I-lactoferrin and (125) I-ASOR to isolated rat hepatocytes at 4 degrees C decreased sharply at pH or = 300 microM CaCl(2), in the presence of 1 mM EDTA. Monensin treatment of <b>hepatocytes,</b> which <b>causes</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> to accumulate inactive ASGP receptors, reduced surface binding of (125) I-lactoferrin and (125) I-ASOR by 46 and 49 %, respectively, with only a 16 % loss of immunodetectable receptor protein from the cell surface. Finally, deacylation of purified ASGP receptors in vitro with 1 M hydroxylamine abolished receptor lectin activity as reflected by the loss of (125) I-ASOR binding as well as the complete loss of specific (125) I-lactoferrin binding. Treatment with 1 M Tris had no effect on binding of either ligand. We conclude from these data that galactose-independent lactoferrin binding to the ASGP receptor requires the receptor's carbohydrate-recognition domain to be in an active configuration. An active configuration is promoted by neutral pH and Ca(2 +), and also requires the receptor subunits to be acylated...|$|R

To investigate {{the role of}} antiapoptotic genes, we compared apoptotic response in primary hepatocytes following GCDC treatment. The hepatocytes from adult Sprague–Dawley rats were cultured in collagen-coated dishes and treated with GCDC in varying concentrations, or the same concentration at different time intervals. Apoptosis was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, DNA fragmentation assay, and caspase assays. Expression of apoptosis-related genes and proteins was evaluated by RT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and Western blotting, respectively. The DNA-binding property of a nuclear protein was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. An interesting result was that GCDC <b>caused</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> apoptosis to display a biphasic phenomenon at a dosage of 50 μM, whereas it was not found at higher dosages such as 200 μM. GCDC stimulated the expression of antiapoptotic Survivin, which also presented a biphasic response. The activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) corresponded with the up-regulation of Survivin. The inhibitor of NF-κB, BAY 11 - 7082, suppressed the expression of Survivin and simultaneously eliminated the biphasic response. The expression of Survivin was transcriptionally mediated by the activation of NF-κB, as shown by EMSA and ChIP assay. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that a low dosage of GCDC induced the hepatocyte apoptosis to exhibit the biphasic response, which was regulated by the expression of Survivin through NF-κB signaling pathway...|$|R

The directly infused left lobes were compared histopathologically with the untreated right lobes. In {{what has been called}} an hepatotrophic effect, stimulatory substances pre vented the atrophy and increased hepatocyte mitoses. Of the hormones tested, only insulin was strongly hepatotrophic; T 3 had a minor effect, and glucagon, prolactin, angiotensin II, vasopressin, norepinephrine and estradiol were inert. Insulin‐like growth factor, hepatic stimulatory substance, transforming growth factor–α and hepatocyte growth factor (also known as hematopoietin A) were powerfully hepatotrophic, but epidermal growth factor had a barely discernible effect. Transforming growth factor–β was inhibitory, but tamoxifen, interleukin‐ 1 and interleukin‐ 2 had no effect. The hepatotrophic action of insulin was not altered when the insulin infusate was mixed with transforming growth factor–β or tamoxifen. These experiments show the importance of in vivo in addition to in vitro testing of putative growth control factors. They illustrate how Eck's fistula model can be used to screen for such substances and possibly to help delineate their mechanisms of action. (HEPATOLOGY 1991; 14 : 665 – 670.)

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{characterized}} the cellular and molecular mechanisms of <b>hepatocyte</b> injury <b>caused</b> by {{the retention of}} hydrophobic bile acids (BAs) in cholestatic diseases. BAs may disrupt cell membranes through their detergent action on lipid components and can promote the generation of reactive oxygen species that, in turn, oxidatively modify lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, and eventually <b>cause</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> necrosis and apoptosis. Several pathways are involved in triggering hepatocyte apoptosis. Toxic BAs can activate hepatocyte death receptors directly and induce oxidative damage, thereby causing mitochondrial dysfunction, and induce endoplasmic reticulum stress. When these compounds are taken up and accumulate inside biliary cells, they can also cause apoptosis. Regarding extrahepatic tissues, the accumulation of BAs in the systemic circulation may contribute to endothelial injury in the kidney and lungs. In gastrointestinal cells, BAs may behave as cancer promoters through an indirect mechanism involving oxidative stress and DNA damage, as well as acting as selection agents for apoptosis-resistant cells. The accumulation of BAs may have also deleterious effects on placental and fetal cells. However, other BAs, such as ursodeoxycholic acid, {{have been shown to}} modulate BA-induced injury in hepatocytes. The major beneficial effects of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid are protection against cytotoxicity due to more toxic BAs; the stimulation of hepatobiliary secretion; antioxidant activity, due in part to an enhancement in glutathione levels; and the inhibition of liver cell apoptosis. Other natural BAs or their derivatives, such as cholyl-N-methylglycine or cholylsarcosine, have also aroused pharmacological interest owing to their protective properties...|$|R
40|$|Objective(s) : Zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} (ZNP) {{are increasingly}} used in sunscreens, biosensors, food additives and pigments. In this study {{the effects of}} ZNP on liver of rats was investigated. Materials and Methods: Experimental groups received 5, 50 and 300 mg/kg ZNP respectively for 14 days. Control group received only distilled water. ALT, AST and ALP were considered as biomarkers to indicate hepatotoxicity. Lipid peroxidation (MDA), SOD and GPx were detected for assessment of oxidative stress in liver tissue. Histological studies and TUNEL assay were also done. Results: Plasma concentration of zinc (Zn) was significantly increased in 5 mg/kg ZNP-treated rats. Liver concentration of Zn was significantly increased in the 300 mg/kg ZNP-treated animals. Weight of liver was markedly increased in both 5 and 300 mg/kg doses of ZNP. ZNP at the doses of 5 mg/kg induced a significant increase in oxidative stress through the increase in MDA content and a significant decrease in SOD and GPx enzymes activity in the liver tissue. Administration of ZNP at 5 mg/kg induced a significant elevation in plasma AST, ALT and ALP. Histological studies showed that treatment with 5 mg/kg of ZNP <b>caused</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> swelling, which was accompanied by congestion of RBC and accumulation of inflammatory cells. Apoptotic index was also significantly increased in this group. ZNP at the dose of 300 mg/kg had poor hepatotoxicity effect. Conclusion: It is concluded that lower doses of ZNP has more hepatotoxic effects on rats, and recommended to use it with caution if there is a hepatological problem...|$|R
40|$|Mitochondrial {{damage is}} the major factor {{underlying}} drug-induced liver disease but whether conditions that thwart mitochondrial injury can prevent or reverse drug-induced liver damage is unclear. A key molecule regulating mitochondria quality control is AMP activated kinase (AMPK). When activated, AMPK causes mitochondria to elongate/fuse and proliferate, with mitochondria now producing more ATP and less reactive oxygen species. Autophagy is also triggered, a process capable of removing damaged/defective mitochondria. To explore whether AMPK activation could potentially prevent or reverse the effects of drug-induced mitochondrial and hepatocellular damage, we added an AMPK activator to collagen sandwich cultures of rat and human hepatocytes exposed to the hepatotoxic drugs, acetaminophen or diclofenac. In the absence of AMPK activation, the drugs <b>caused</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> to lose polarized morphology and have significantly decreased ATP levels and viability. At the subcellular level, mitochondria underwent fragmentation and had decreased membrane potential due to decreased expression of the mitochondrial fusion proteins Mfn 1, 2 and/or Opa 1. Adding AICAR, a specific AMPK activator, {{at the time of}} drug exposure prevented and reversed these effects. The mitochondria became highly fused and ATP production increased, and hepatocytes maintained polarized morphology. In exploring the mechanism responsible for this preventive and reversal effect, we found that AMPK activation prevented drug-mediated decreases in Mfn 1, 2 and Opa 1. AMPK activation also stimulated autophagy/mitophagy, most significantly in acetaminophen-treated cells. These results suggest that activation of AMPK prevents/reverses drug-induced mitochondrial and hepatocellular damage through regulation of mitochondrial fusion and autophagy, making it a potentially valuable approach for treatment of drug-induced liver injury...|$|R
40|$|Mice {{deficient}} {{in the nuclear}} factor κB (NF-κB) -transactivating gene RelA (p 65) die at embryonic days 14 – 15 with massive liver apoptosis. In the adult liver, activation of the NF-κB heterodimer RelA/p 50 can <b>cause</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> proliferation, apoptosis, or the induction of acute-phase response genes. We examined, during wild-type fetal liver development, {{the expression of the}} Rel family member proteins, as well as other proteins known to be important for NF-κB activation. We found these proteins and active NF-κB complexes in the developing liver from at least 2 days before the onset of lethality observed in RelA knockouts. This suggests that the timing of NF-κB activation is not related to the timing of lethality. We therefore hypothesized that, in the absence of RelA, embryos were sensitized to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 (TNFR- 1) -mediated apoptosis. Thus, we generated mice that were {{deficient in}} both RelA and TNFR- 1 to determine whether apoptotic signaling through TNFR- 1 was responsible for the lethal phenotype. RelA/TNFR- 1 double knockout mice survived embryonic development and were born with normal livers without evidence of increased hepatocyte apoptosis. These animals became runted shortly after birth and survived an average of 10 days, dying from acute hepatitis with an extensive hepatic infiltration of immature neutrophils. We conclude that neither RelA nor TNFR- 1 is required for liver development and that RelA protects the embryonic liver from TNFR- 1 -mediated apoptotic signals. However, the absence of both TNFR- 1 signaling and RelA activity in newborn mice makes these animals susceptible to endogenous hepatic infection...|$|R
40|$|Autoimmune {{reactions}} involving cytochrome P 4502 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1) are {{a feature}} of idiosyncratic liver injury induced by halogenated hydrocarbons and isoniazid, but are also detectable in about {{one third of the}} patients with advanced alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and chronic hepatitis C (CHC). In these latter the presence of anti-CYP 2 E 1 auto-antibodies is an independent predictor of extensive necro-inflammation and fibrosis and worsens the recurrence of hepatitis following liver transplantation, indicating that CYP 2 E 1 -directed autoimmunity can contribute to hepatic injury. The molecular characterization of the antigens recognized by anti-CYP 2 E 1 auto-antibodies in ALD and CHC has shown that the targeted conformational epitopes are located in close proximity on the molecular surface. Furthermore, these epitopes can be recognized on CYP 2 E 1 expressed on hepatocyte plasma membranes where they can trigger antibody-mediated cytotoxicity. This does not exclude that T cell-mediated responses against CYP 2 E 1 might also be involved in <b>causing</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> damage. CYP 2 E 1 structural modifications by reactive metabolites and molecular mimicry represent important factors in the breaking of self-tolerance against CYP 2 E 1 in, respectively, ALD and CHC. However, genetic or acquired interferences with the mechanisms controlling the homeostasis of the immune system are also likely to contribute. More studies are needed to better characterize the impact of anti-CYP 2 E 1 autoimmunity in liver diseases particularly in relation to the fact that common metabolic alterations such as obesity and diabetes stimulates hepatic CYP 2 E 1 expression...|$|R
40|$|The X protein from {{a chronic}} strain of {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBx) {{was determined to}} inhibit Fas-mediated ap-optosis and promote cell survival. Fas-mediated apopto-sis is the major <b>cause</b> of <b>hepatocyte</b> damage during liver disease. Experiments demonstrated that cell death caused by anti-Fas antibodies was blocked by the ex-pression of HBx in human primary hepatocytes and mouse embryo fibroblasts. This effect was also observed in mouse erythroleukemia cells that lacked p 53, indicat-ing that protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis was independent of p 53. Components of the signal transduc-tion pathways involved in this protection were studied. The SAPK/JNK pathway has previously been suggested to be a survival pathway for some cells undergoing Fas-mediated apoptosis, and kinase assays showed tha...|$|R
