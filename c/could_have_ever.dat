25|$|Cinderpaw {{falls from}} the Sky Oak, {{breaking}} her back leg. As Leafpool's determination to heal her begins to border on an obsession, Jaypaw begins to wonder why. One night, he falls asleep by Cinderpaw and wakes up in a strange forest. There he meets Cinderpaw, unhurt, who leads him to a camp filled with familiar smells; ThunderClan's previous home in the forest. Cinderpaw describes how she once lived there before the Great Journey and asks Jaypaw to tell Leafpool that she is proud of her, and that she has learned far more than she <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> taught her. By then Jaypaw is confused, but upon looking into Cinderpaw's eyes, he sees a series of flashbacks from her previous life. Jaypaw realizes that when Cinderpelt, the former ThunderClan medicine cat, died in Twilight she was reincarnated as Cinderpaw, without Cinderpaw herself knowing it. However, when Cinderpaw wakes she does not remember the dream, only that Jaypaw {{had been able to}} see in it.|$|E
25|$|After feeling jilted by Bianca {{a second}} time in what she {{believes}} to be Bianca having chosen Babe as a lover, she enters into a romantic relationship with bad boy Jonathan Lavery. Maggie, unaware when finding Bianca in bed with Babe earlier {{that it was a}} ploy to trap JR into confessing that he framed Jamie, wraps herself deeply into Jonathan's life. It is not long before Jamie goes on the run with Babe, leaving Maggie without a roommate. She has Jonathan move in with her. Everything goes well with Jonathan at first, their relationship seeming to be more about sex in the beginning. Jonathan is even aware of Maggie's sexual confusion and asks her how she <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> thought she was gay. Maggie says she was wrong. Although Bianca and Maggie share a second kiss together, Maggie stresses to Bianca that she is not a lesbian. Things begin to fall apart for Jonathan and Maggie's romance when she finds him destroying the shirt Bianca wore the night Miranda was born. Jonathan convinces Maggie that the shirt would have provided the evidence needed to prove that the Cambias heir, Ethan, is really a Cambias, and would have resulted in Jonathan's brother, the current heir to the Cambias fortune, Ryan, to lose everything. Maggie covers for him with Bianca.|$|E

Katie Hasty from HitFix praised the choreography, calling it [...] "eye-popping", and labelled the video as [...] "classy, contained, and borderline claustrophobic".

Furthermore, she felt that the video was representative of The xx's sound, calling it [...] "morose and hypnotic, just like the band, the aural equivalent of a mumblecore movie", and opined {{that the end of}} the video showed how [...] "love goes". Chris Ryan from MTV also found the video similar to the band's musical style, and commented that the slight changes in its pattern [...] "suggest unrest under the surface -- much like the band's pristine, subtly menacing sound". He also noted that while [...] "it's often hard to imagine what visuals would go well" [...] with The xx's songs, the music video for [...] "Islands" [...] "trumps anything we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> imagined".|$|E

[...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. [...] He advises, [...] "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. [...] All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything."

500|$|In 2009, Stransky was {{favorable}} of both Strong's narration {{and performance}} in the fifth season episode [...] "The Best Thing That <b>Could</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Ever</b> Happened", describing Mary Alice's role in the episode as [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and writing: [...] "I know we hear Brenda Strong nearly every week in her voiceovers, {{but it was so}} nice to see her on screen again! That lady can act." [...] Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic was bored by Mary Alice's flashback scenes in the sixth season episode [...] "Epiphany", believing them to be unrealistic. Daniel Goldberg of Slant Magazine praised Mary Alice's narration in the series finale in 2012, writing: [...] "There was one resolution that truly resonated. When the ladies all move out of [...] Lane and politely promise to keep in touch and visit, Mary Alice (Brenda Strong) takes the opportunity to unearth one last lie. With one of her most somber voiceovers ever, she lets us in on a secret that the housewives already know: They won’t keep in touch, and they won’t visit. The moment is far more unsettling and existential than the overblown sequence of the desperately deceased gathering to wave Susan goodbye. Deep friendships and passing acquaintances can never be replicated, and these are the endings we experience every day, even as we try to deny their finality." [...] Writing for Backstage magazine in 2012, Jeffery Self wrote that Strong's narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming [...] "one of the most familiar on television". As a result of her popularity as the series' narrator, Anna Silman of Vulture magazine described Strong as [...] "everybody's favorite deceased housewife/omniscient narrator" [...] in 2014.|$|E
500|$|Childhood Memories is, {{together}} with a short story about his teacher Isaia Teodorescu (titled [...] "Popa Duhu"), one of Creangă's two memoirs. George Călinescu proposed that, like his fairy tales, the book illustrates popular narrative conventions, a matter accounting for their special place in literature: [...] "The stories are true, but typical, without depth. Once retold with {{a different kind of}} gesticulation, the subject would lose all of its lively atmosphere." [...] Also based on the techniques of traditional oral accounts, it features the topical interventions of a first-person narrator in the form of soliloquies, and reflects in part the literary canon set by frame stories. The resulting effect, Călinescu argued, was not that of [...] "a confession or a diary", but that of a symbolic account depicting [...] "the childhood of the universal child." [...] According to Vianu, the text is especially illustrative of its author's [...] "spontaneous passage" [...] between the levels of [...] "popular" [...] and [...] "cultured" [...] literature: [...] "The idea of fictionalizing oneself, of outlining one's formative steps, the steady accumulation of impressions from life, and then the sentiment of time, of its irreversible flow, of regret for all things lost in its consumption, of the charm relived through one's recollections are all thoughts, feelings and attitudes defining a modern man of culture. No popular model <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> stood before Creangă when he was writing his Memories, but, surely, neither could the cultured prototypes of the genre, the first autobiographies and memoirs of the Renaissance". Grădinaru and essayist Mircea Moț analyzed the volume as a fundamentally sad text, in stated contrast with its common perception as a recollection of joyful moments: the former focused on moments which seem to depict Nică as a loner, the latter highlighted those sections which include Creangă's bitter musings about destiny and the impregnability of changes. A distinct interpretation was provided by critic Luminița Marcu, who reacted against the tradition of viewing Creangă's actual childhood as inseparable from his own subjective rendition.|$|E
500|$|Post was {{released}} on 13 June 1995, as a 12" [...] record, CD, and compact cassette. It was issued on One Little Indian Records in the United Kingdom and Elektra Records in the United States and Canada; Polydor Records issued Post in Australia and Japan, also releasing the European edition of the album. Lead single [...] "Army of Me" [...] {{was released}} on 21 April 1995, shortly after the album's production concluded. It was released in the United Kingdom as two different CD releases, with [...] "Cover Me", [...] "You've Been Flirting Again", [...] "Sweet Intuition", and various remixes as its B-sides. It debuted at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming her first UK Top 10 single. Although it {{dropped out of the}} Top 20 the next week, [...] "Army of Me" [...] remained in the Top 75 for five weeks. The ending of [...] "Army of Me" [...] music video depicted Björk bombing an art museum, and due to a recent terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City, MTV removed it from its playlist before it even aired. Within weeks it was broadcast, although this [...] "foreshadowed a string of unlucky events that would further hinder Posts unveiling". An unsourced sample by Robin Rimbaud, prominently heard throughout [...] "Possibly Maybe", resulted in a lawsuit demanding a co-songwriter credit. After Rimbaud's label New Electronica refused Birkett's standard sample clearance compensation of £1,000, he and Björk resolved to destroy over 100,000 copies of the album, and [...] "remixing, remastering, and reprinting a new version". However, and at the request of Rimbaud, New Electronica later let Björk use his sample completely free of charge, meaning One Little Indian did not have to issue another version after all, since stores had yet to run out of stock of Post initial run. Björk was also due back in court as a witness in Simon Fisher's lawsuit against Nellee Hooper and herself (regarding Debuts writing credits), charges that were eventually cleared by judge Robin Jacob. Author Mark Pytlik writes: [...] "The strange combination of events had conspired to form the strangest promotional tour anyone <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> envisioned: in the week since Post had been released, Björk had seen her album deleted, her video banned, and two separate lawsuits brought against her". One Little Indian were also better prepared to promote the album, scheduling a string of European and American tour dates from the beginning of July into late August.|$|E

Finally, Voigt presented her Ariadne in a 2001 recording released by Deutsche Grammophon in which Natalie Dessay, Swedish mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter and Canadian tenor Ben Heppner co-starred, and Giuseppe Sinopoli conducted. Voigt said that if he had not participated in the project, she doubts she <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> recorded Ariadne.

2500|$|During Ellison's 2006 campaign, Republican blogger Michael Brodkorb {{unearthed}} posts about Ellison's Minnesota Daily {{articles and}} {{his involvement with}} the Nation of Islam. In response, Ellison {{wrote a letter to}} the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota & the Dakotas saying he had never been a member, and that his connections with the Nation of Islam were limited to an 18-month period during which he helped organize the Minnesota contingent at the 1995 Million Man March. In 2016, CNN referred instead to Ellison's [...] "decade-long involvement in the Nation of Islam".

[...] With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the Jerry Chestnut song [...] "Another Place, Another Time", which was released as a single on March 9, 1968, and, to everyone's amazement, shot up the country charts. [...] At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing Iago in a rock and roll adaptation of Othello called Catch My Soul in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer Jerry Kennedy.

2500|$|Much {{critical}} attention retrospectively {{focused on}} the measure of difference between, on one hand, the originality and subjectivity in Ion Creangă's first-person narrative and, on the other, their debt to the affixed conventions of traditional literary discourse. George Călinescu, the influential interwar critic and literary historian, argued that the writing appealed to traditional storytelling, lacking in individuality, and therefore dissimilar to [...] "a confession or a diary." [...] Instead, he believed, the Memories outline [...] "the childhood of the universal child." [...] Assessing that the book adapts the characteristics of oral tradition and frame narratives leading back to Renaissance literature, Călinescu also saw them mainly as a testing ground for the author's soliloquy and an illustration of his abilities as a raconteur. He argued: [...] "The stories are true, but typical, without depth. Once retold with {{a different kind of}} gesticulation, the subject would lose all of its lively atmosphere." [...] In contrast, Călinescu's contemporary and colleague Tudor Vianu argued: [...] "The character in [...] stories, novellas and anecdotes recounts himself Childhood Memories, a work so not like folk narratives in its intent." [...] In reference to the similarities between the text and the Renaissance tradition, Vianu also noted: [...] "The idea of fictionalizing oneself, of outlining one's formative steps, the steady accumulation of impressions from life, and then the sentiment of time, of its irreversible flow, of regret for all things lost in its consumption, of the charm relived through one's recollections are all thoughts, feelings and attitudes defining a modern man of culture. No popular model <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> stood before Creangă when he was writing his Memories, but, surely, neither could the cultured prototypes of the genre, the first autobiographies and memoirs of the Renaissance". According to his interpretation: [...] "Here, as in his stories and novellas, Creangă effects the passage from the popular level of literature to its cultured level, following a strictly spontaneous path by organically developing a talent exercised throughout the past of an old rural culture, now reaching a point where it surpasses itself." ...|$|E
