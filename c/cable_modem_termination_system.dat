5000|$|A cable hub is a {{building}} or shelter usually {{smaller than a}} headend that takes an already processed video signal from a headend and transmits it to a local community. (or multiple communities) Most cable hubs are {{used in conjunction with}} an HFC Plant. Combined IP video and data enters a hub via a microwave or fiber optic transport circuit and gets routed to QAM devices such as a <b>Cable</b> <b>modem</b> <b>termination</b> <b>system</b> which changes the IP data into an RF QAM to be combined with other services (such as video on demand, switched video) and transmitted to the subscriber. The RF from each service gets combined in the hub to ultimately a single coax cable broken down per node, but right before it leaves the hub to feed customers, gets changed to fiber optic light to feed local cable nodes which may cover a large building, a neighborhood or in rural areas, an entire community. The cable node located in the field in-turn reverses the optical light from the hub and changes the signals back to RF over coaxial cable. This is called a [...] "forward" [...] path (download). The inverse happens on the upload or [...] "return" [...] path as customers transmit data back to a hub. Cable nodes were initially intended to reduce amplifier cascade and improve signal quality to subscribers distant from a hub. Modern cable nodes still serve the same purpose for amplifier cascade reduction, but now are strategically placed in areas of high data density to better allocate bandwidth availability and reduce oversubscribing in a particular area. Cable nodes also allow for multiple channel lineups or public access markets out of the same hub.|$|E

40|$|The cable {{industry}} originated in United States {{with the first}} cable television being invented in 1948. Since the 1990 s, many digital devices have been produced and many {{people have come to}} rely on the services provided by cable networks, which has lead to significant investment in cable network technologies. Interactive programs like GPS, on-line games and video conferencing, have been introduced in recent years. The customer demands of both uploading data (upstream) to and downloading data (downstream) from the Internet are increasing. There is an international telecommunication standard, DOCSIS, which sets rules for all cable systems. The latest version DOCSIS 3. 1 makes a leap forward in technology to offer larger bandwidth and faster data rates in both upstream and downstream transmissions. This thesis focuses on one key parameter, cyclic prefix length, of the upstream transmission system. The <b>cable</b> <b>modem</b> upstream uses Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access(OFDMA) for data transmission, which allows a high volume of users to share the whole band at the same time. Each user occupies a set of sub-carriers for data transmission. The <b>cable</b> <b>modem</b> transmitter partitions the data into packets that fit into OFDMA frames and sends the data frames in time sequence to <b>Cable</b> <b>Modem</b> <b>Termination</b> System(CMTS). Different <b>cable</b> <b>modems</b> in the same frame may have different delays. In each frame, the cyclic prefix is fixed for all Cable Modems(CMs), and the constellation types can be varied for each CM in order to achieve the best possible data rate. Therefore, selecting an optimum Cyclic Prefix(CP) length for the system is an important issue. For all CMs in a frame, if the CP is long enough to cover the longest delay, the data transmission efficiency will be low. However, if the CP length is short, some CMs' performances will be degraded. To balance the trade-off between the frame length and the signal quality, the purpose of this research project is to generate a computer program which is able to choose the optimum CP length for a given <b>cable</b> <b>modem</b> upstream transmission system. The system must obey the rules set by DOCSIS 3. 1. Several models were built to analyze and corroborate the distribution of interferences generated by a single sub-carrier when the CP length is insufficient to cover the channel delay. Finally, a series of mathematical equations, which can successfully estimate the distribution are developed. The developed Best CP Length Selection Program is described in detail. The signal processing procedures and computation methods are explained step by step. The useful data per minislot was chosen to be the criteria for the program. DOCSIS 3. 1 allows eleven CP lengths for the upstream transmission system. By analyzing these allowed CP lengths and computing the useful data per minislot for each, the best CP length can be determined. The program was tested for several hypothetical cable networks and generated logical results in all cases. The results show the Best CP Length Selection Program works properly and is reliable...|$|R

40|$|Project (M. S., Computer Science) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. This project bestows an {{analysis}} of the lifecycle of a cable modem (CM). In order to provide services to a customer, the CM goes through an initialization sequence consisted of several stages. Among these several stages, Initial Ranging, IP Connectivity, Transfer Operational Parameters & Registration with the <b>Cable</b> <b>Modem</b> <b>Termination</b> <b>System</b> (CMTS) are main four stages. In the Initial Ranging phase, the CM acquires the downstream and upstream channels. Acquisitions of these channels are important as they provide a unique communication link between the CM and the CMTS. While in IP connectivity phase, the CM acquires the IP address from the CMTS, which will give the CM a unique identity among all other network elements. In the Transfer Operational Parameters phase, the CM will obtain configuration file from the CMTS, which will inform the about the services it has to provide to customer. In addition, in Registration phase, the CM registers with the CMTS. After completion of this initialization sequence, the CM comes online and it will be capable to provide voice, video and data services to the customer. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the two transition phases pursued by a CM and these two phases are Initial Ranging and Transfer Operational Parameters. The purpose behind this project is to implement state machine transition performed by the CM in order to achieve project goal. To achieve the goal a dummy process has been created which will act as ???<b>cable</b> <b>modem</b> <b>termination</b> <b>system???</b> and which will be able to provide appropriate responses to the CM???s requests.

40|$|Admission Control for the Cisco <b>Cable</b> <b>Modem</b> <b>Termination</b> <b>System</b> (CMTS) is a {{multifaceted}} feature that implements a Quality of Service (QoS) {{policy on the}} CMTS Headend.

Admission Control monitors multiple system-level resources on the Cisco CMTS, and performs automatic resource allocation on a service-request basis. Admission Control maintains optimal system-level operation by preventing resource consumption that would otherwise degrade the performance for the entire Cisco CMTS. Furthermore, Admission Control can allocate upstream or downstream bandwidth resources to specific DOCSIS traffic types, and maintain such prioritization amidst very dynamic traffic conditions. When any system-level or bandwidth-level resource approaches critical consumption levels, Admission Control implements graceful degradation of service in a planned and graceful manner.

The results show that the SNR is high and the bandwidth achieves expected value, so this design scheme is feasible. Introduce CMTS is a device of access layer, which located in cable television network’s front-end, providing data conversion in HFC network to the IP network to transmit data. The downstream is divided into several channels as the data communication channels, Meanwhile, the electrical signals in the coax cable is covered into data with frames format comply with Ethernet protocol to achieve data communication. With the development of three networks convergence and the implementation of cable television bidirectional regenerated, it has an important significance to improve the function of core device of HFC network to promote bandwidth of access network...|$|E
