40|$|Abstract: The {{compulsory}} registration of births and deaths was established throughout most European countries during the 19 th century. Enabling legislation was introduced for Ireland in 1863 {{with the first}} registration report produced in 1864. Mortality data are derived from the medical certification of cause of death issued by the medical practitioner together with information given to the registrar by the informant. These data fulfil the primary role <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>documentation</b> and secondly provide a source of vital statistics on the population. For the last century such data have formed the cornerstone of {{our understanding of the}} health status of the population and of the health needs of society, but now {{at the start of the}} 21 st century it is perhaps opportune to look at their current utility and possible value in future years. The legal requirement for registration remains unchanged but the question that this paper addresses is ‘in an aging society, where the exact cause of death is more difficult to discern- what is the future for mortality statistics?...|$|R

40|$|Global {{private law}} {{has become the}} source of both anxiety and euphoria. Inherent in this fascination is the {{assumption}} that global private law threatens the legitimacy of the state by taking over its functions through new techniques of governance. In this article, I build upon research in one arena of global private governance, the production <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>documentation</b> for the global swap markets, to challenge the most prominent assumptions about private law beyond the state. I argue that rather than focusing on how global private law is or is not an artifact of state power, a body of private norms, or a coherent legal system, we should view global private law as a set of institutions, actors, doctrines, ideas, documents, that is, as a specialized set of 2 ̆ 2 knowledge practices. 2 ̆ 2 Viewed from this perspective, global private law is not a radical departure from state law, but really more of the same.

40|$|The European {{programme}} {{for completing}} the Single European Market {{by the end}} of 1992 has raised a number of questions about the labour market. These concern in particular the distribution of employment amongst members of the European Community {{and the quality of the}} jobs created.

Widely differing arguments have been advanced about how far individual member states and the Community should respond by introducing an element of social protection to this process of completing the Single European Market. This project aims to investigate the evolution of rules at European and national level in selected areas of labour market regulation.

40|$|Purpose This paper {{wants to}} propose a system {{architecture}} for a context-sensitive terminology management system (TMS) in the domain <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> LSP. The TMS is expected {{to meet the needs}} of the translation services in the Belgian Federal Public Service of Justice in that our TMS will allow to search, (re) use and edit each term in its customized archetypical phraseological context. In a second part, we propose to link this TMS to EN 15038, the EU standard on Translation Services, which has been developed to streamline translation projects aiming to deliver more efficient multilingual LSP documentation. Method In a first step, automatic knowledge acquisition algorithms will be developed to mine context-sensitive terminological information from the online corpora <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> translations. In a second step, a feed-back loop between interface developers and expert users will be set up to optimize user access to the contextualized terminological knowledge base during the actual translation process. To meet these requirements, there will be an intense co-operation between terminologists, the developers of the knowledge extraction algorithms, database and software engineers, and expert users. Results The TMS is expected to display an interface offering the look-and-feel of a standard desktop CAT-tool. The actual application will run remotely on a server in a cloud-based architecture which will be available via an online interface. As a collaborative working environment, the tool will allow extensive and real-time interactive user management. Conclusion This paper analyses the challenges legal translators are facing in the Belgian Federal Public Service of Justice. At present, translation-oriented authoring and translation proper <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>documentation</b> are being carried out on an ad-hoc basis. An R&D project has been set up to design a TMS which is expected to deliver correct and consistent legal terminology and collocations in both source and target languages. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates how Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) {{influenced}} {{the implementation of}} the National Land Titling Project (PETT) in Peru. The study of the impact of women’s mobilization is approached from the perspective of social movement theory and theory on women and land rights. Land titling projects such as PETT raise a number of questions about the social implications of formalization. Women often are disadvantaged when it comes to land titling, due to several factors such as lack <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>documentation,</b> illiteracy and the predominant gender division of labor. However, evaluations of the formalization process in Peru show that there has been an increase in the incidence of joint ownership from {{the first phase of the}} implementation process to the second, even though the joint titling of land to couples was never adopted as official policy. Heavy criticism was raised towards PETT by feminist NGOs and social movements in the late nineties, promoting equal land rights. Researchers mention the mobilization as a possible explanation for the increase in joint ownership, suggesting that the activism of CSOs led the implementing agency to favor joint ownership between spouses. Even though the result of PETT was an increase in the incidence of joint titling, and the goal of the civil society campaign was to include women in the titling process, one cannot exclude other explanations. Defining outcome is more complex than this. All the effects are taking place within a broader political and cultural context that will form the political opportunity structure and influence the impact of civil society mobilization. In Peru political changes were occurring, and there was recognition of women’s land rights in international politics. The changes in the political space created space for new actors, and a change in the extent of repression of collective actors, both from the government forces and from terrorist groups. These changes seem to have created a good environment for action. However, the increase in joint titling might not have occurred had it not been for PETT’s willingness to improve and the changes that have taken place in the broader political context...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Latino {{population}} of greater Pittsburgh is considered invisible {{because it is}} not concentrated within one geographic area. This is of great public health significance, because such dispersion is a major barrier for Latinos seeking quality health care and social services. In the last ten years, this population has grown over 44 %, and many of the estimated 20, 000 Latinos in the Pittsburgh area do not have medical insurance. Across the nation, research has shown that Latinos often suffer from higher incidence of diseases and accidental deaths. Latinos also frequently experience limited access to health care and social services, and the level of social integration experienced by population members is directly related to this diverse community's quality of life. METHODS: This study is based on qualitative interviews with a small, purposive sample of young adult Hispanic immigrants, a group likely to experience barriers to accessing services. A free clinic, staffed by bilingual volunteers, was the initial access point to reach uninsured population members. Interviews with participants were recorded, transcribed, and studied to discover which health care and social service needs the community feels they lack, and how their level of social integration was related to their access to services. RESULTS: The most frequently mentioned service needs were dental services, health insurance, bilingual health service providers and/or translation services, and English language classes. Social isolation, lack <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>documentation,</b> fear, racial discrimination, and lack of cultural competence on behalf of institutional employees were frequently cited as major barriers to accessing services. The length of respondents' stay in Pittsburgh did not appear to {{have a significant effect on}} improving respondents' access to needed services. Access to services was related more to the size and extent of one's social network, which usually consisted of family members who had lived in Pittsburgh before the respondent arrived, or which grew slowly over the time the respondent lived in Pittsburgh. CONCLUSIONS: Pittsburgh's Latino population would benefit from increased outreach efforts and increased community mobilization strategies. As a new growth community, Pittsburgh service providers are not fully prepared to reach the needs of the population. Additional research, qualitative in nature, will help to increase awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by this community as it seeks to access much needed services and health care...|$|R
