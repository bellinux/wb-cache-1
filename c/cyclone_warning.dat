5|$|In {{the event}} an Atlantic {{hurricane}} threatens the northern coast of South America, the National Hurricane Center defines nine locations as tropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>warning</b> breakpoints. The westernmost is {{the border between}} Panama and Colombia, and the easternmost is Georgetown, Guyana, located at 6.82° N. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, tropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>warning</b> breakpoints extend eastward to the border of Panama and Colombia at 7.23° N. No Atlantic hurricane has existed south of 6.82° N, and no Pacific hurricane has existed east of 80° W, though in the event a tropical cyclone threatens a region of South America without warnings, additional warning sites can be selected. In addition to warnings on the mainland of South America, the National Hurricane Center defines the entire island of San Andres as a tropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>warning</b> breakpoint.|$|E
5|$|In Mauritius, a {{total of}} 200people {{evacuated}} to storm shelters due to the cyclone. The island was under a <b>Cyclone</b> <b>Warning</b> Class III for 36hours, {{and for a few}} more hours it was under a <b>Cyclone</b> <b>Warning</b> Class IV, the latter meaning wind gusts of 120km/h (75mph) were reported or expected. Prior to the storm affecting the area, officials in Réunion closed schools and also issued a temporary driving ban. Due to the threat of the storm, several flights in and out of Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues were canceled. Fishermen were banned from sailing out to sea.|$|E

5|$|When {{a system}} {{develops}} into a tropical cyclone below 10°S between 90°E and 160°E, {{then it will}} be named by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) which operates three Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> <b>Warning</b> Centres in Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane. The names are assigned in alphabetical order and used in rotating order without regard to year.|$|E
5|$|Strong shear {{associated}} with the outflow of Cyclone Olaf caused all convection {{associated with}} Nancy to be displaced to the southwest on February16. Early on February17, Nancy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>warning</b> centre (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. Shortly after, the low was absorbed into the larger circulation of Olaf. However, TCWC Wellington continued to monitor Nancy as a separate system until 1200UTC on February18.|$|E
50|$|Early on 4 January, Bernie {{was close}} to making {{landfall}} over Mornington Island, and <b>cyclone</b> <b>warnings</b> were declared between the Northern Territory border and Kowanyama in Queensland. However, the <b>cyclone</b> <b>warnings</b> were shifted to the west {{later in the day}} for areas between Port McArthur in the Northern Territory and the Gilbert-Einasleigh River mouth in Queensland. As the cyclone neared the island, many residents in Mornington Island were moved to a more secure shelter. A few hours later, residents between Port McArthur and Karumba, Queensland were warned of a dangerous storm surge associated with Bernie.|$|R

5|$|Early on February 10, RSMC Nadi placed Niuafo'ou and Niuatoputapu under a {{tropical}} cyclone alert, before {{early the next}} day extending the alert to the whole of Tonga. Later that day the Vavau, Haapai, and Nomuka islands were placed under a gale warning. The warnings stayed in force until late on February 12 when the gale warning was canceled, and concurrently, southern Tonga was placed under {{a tropical}} <b>cyclone</b> <b>warning.</b> These warnings were canceled on February 14. During the cyclone, RSMC Nadi placed the Lau Islands under a strong wind warning, and a damaging swell warning was declared for Fiji. Businesses in Nuku'alofa closed as the storm passed by.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{held its}} {{strength}} {{for some time}} as it moved southward between Ono-i-Lau and Tongatapu. Beginning to accelerate, Vaianu entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> <b>Warning</b> Centre in Wellington, New Zealand. It curved southeastward and slowly deteriorated due to increasing wind shear and colder sea surface temperatures. The JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm on February 15, and {{by the next day}} it was undergoing an extratropical transition. At 0600 UTC, the JTWC classified it as extratropical, but it remained a powerful storm system for several days as it tracked over the open ocean.|$|E

50|$|Late on March 9, {{ahead of}} the {{depression}} being classified as a tropical cyclone and named Lusi, the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-Hazards Department issued tropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>warnings</b> for the Vanuatu provinces of Torba, Sanma, Penama and Malampa.|$|R
50|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Wati {{originated}} in the South Pacific region and moved into Brisbane's area of responsibility in late March. It later moved to the south-east where cyclone watches were issued for Lord Howe Island and <b>cyclone</b> <b>warnings</b> for Norfolk Island.|$|R
5|$|At 1800UTC on March22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{an area of}} disturbed {{weather in}} the central Indian Ocean, approximately 685km (425mi) southeast of Christmas Island. The system was embedded mostly in the monsoon trough, surrounded by favorable environmental conditions, which prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0030UTC on March24. Convection increased as vertical wind shear decreased, and the system developed a curved band pattern. Throughout the day, the storm showed signs of potential rapid intensification, due to its quick organization. The Bureau of Meteorology's Perth Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> <b>Warning</b> Center (Perth TCWC) noted {{the system as a}} tropical low at 1000UTC on March24, and the JTWC issued its first warning two hours later. However, for reasons which remain unclear, the Bureau of Meteorology did not extensively monitor the system.|$|E
5|$|Early on October 22, both RSMC Nadi and TCWC Brisbane {{started to}} issue special {{advisories}} {{to support the}} meteorological services of Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands in tracking the cyclone. As Xavier was over the islands of Santa Cruz the whole of Temotu Province was placed under a tropical cyclone gale warning, while cyclone watches were declared for Rennel, Bellona, and Vanuatu. During the next 24 hours, the Torres and Banks Islands, as well as Espirito Santo, Maewo, Ambae, were placed under a <b>cyclone</b> <b>warning.</b> The warnings for the Solomon Islands were then cancelled early the next day, while the warnings for Vanuatu were maintained until late on October 25, when RSMC Nadi discontinued them.|$|E
5|$|On 21November, a cyclone watch {{was raised}} for coastal and nearby inland areas of Western Australia between Wyndham and Beagle Bay. This watch was soon {{expanded}} to encompass areas {{east to the}} Western Australia–Northern Territory border and west to the Mitchell Plateau. Additionally, areas from Mitchell Plateau to Cockatoo Island were placed under a <b>cyclone</b> <b>warning.</b> The following day, watches extended to Cape Hotham Light in the Northern Territory, including the city of Darwin and the Tiwi Islands. As the cyclone intensified, warnings gradually spread eastward. Warnings reached as far east as Point Stuart prior to Alessia's landfall. All watches and warnings were dropped on 24November as Alessia moved inland and degraded to a tropical low.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} nearly {{struck the}} Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu.

5|$|The Indian Meteorological Department {{periodically}} issued <b>cyclone</b> <b>warning</b> bulletins {{during the}} storm's lifetime, {{with the first}} being directed to the Chief Secretary of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 26October; the first bulletin noted potential impacts and advised fishermen not to venture out to sea. Six warnings were issued for the islands, with the last being issued on 27October once the storm passed {{to the north and}} west. Due to initial uncertainty in the storm's forecast track, the first warnings for the coast of mainland India on 27October concerned northern Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal. Hourly dissemination of cyclone bulletins were carried out by Doordarshan and All India Radio beginning on 28October. These warnings eventually narrowed in scope to the eventually affected areas, with the last warning being issued for Odisha on 31October.|$|E
5|$|The South Pacific Basin, {{as defined}} by the World Meteorological Organization, is split into two sub-areas, {{monitored}} by separate agencies. The first area is between 160°E and 120°W and north of 25°S are monitored by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) in Nadi. Those that move south of 25°S are monitored by the Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> <b>Warning</b> Centre in Wellington, New Zealand. At the start of the season, a new naming policy was introduced by the Tropical Cyclone Committee for the South Pacific and South- East Indian Ocean. The policy stated that a storm attaining gale-force winds in only one quadrant near its center would be named by the Fiji Meteorological Service. This is in contrast to the previous policy in which gale-force winds had to completely surround the center to be named.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{declared}} as Tropical Cyclone Monica on 17April, the Bureau of Meteorology {{issued a}} gale warning for areas {{along the eastern}} coast of Far North Queensland. Several hours later, a <b>cyclone</b> <b>warning</b> was issued for north-eastern areas as the storm intensified. An estimated 1,000 people were planned to be evacuated in Far North Queensland before officials shut down major highways in the area. Ferry services in the Great Barrier Reef and flights {{in and out of}} the region were cancelled. However, no evacuations took place according to the Emergency Management in Australia. An aborigine community of 700, located around the mouth of the Lockhart River, were in the direct path of the storm. The chief executive officer of the community stated that they were ready for the storm, having suffered no losses from Cyclone Ingrid which impacted the same area in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Within the South Pacific, {{tropical}} cyclones are {{monitored by}} the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, and the Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> <b>Warning</b> Center (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. RSMC Nadi attaches a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the South Pacific. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issues unofficial warnings within the South Pacific, designating tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measure windspeeds {{over a period of}} ten minutes, while the JTWC measures sustained winds over a period of one minute and uses the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E
5|$|A monsoon trough {{was noted}} {{along the coast}} of Australia's Northern Territory in late November into early December 1988. This system led to {{sporadic}} heavy rain in the region. On 12December, a tropical low consolidated from the monsoon trough over the Timor Sea, west of Darwin, Northern Territory. Moving southwest, the system skirted the Kimberley coast before turning west. Acquiring gale-force winds by 00:00UTC on 13December, the low was classified as a Category1 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Ilona by the Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> <b>Warning</b> Centre (TCWC) in Perth, Western Australia. At this time it was situated near Adele Island. Twelve hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories, dubbing it Tropical Cyclone 03S. Decelerating somewhat, Ilona steadily intensified over the following days and achieved severe tropical cyclone status—having ten-minute sustained winds of at least —around 12:00UTC on 15December. Similarly, the JTWC assessed the system to have reached the equivalent of a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS) by 18:00UTC.|$|E
5|$|After Narelle {{moved into}} TCWC Perth's area of {{responsibility}} on 9 January, a cyclone watch was issued for areas between Whim Creek and Coral Bay. A blue alert, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) lowest level of readiness, was also issued for areas between Mardie and Whim Creek. The following day, the watch was upgraded to a <b>cyclone</b> <b>warning</b> for all areas and a new watch was issued to the west, encompassing areas as far as Cape Cuvier. The watch was further extended early on 11 January to include areas between Cape Cuvier and Carnarvon. As the storm continued on a more westward path than initially anticipated, the warning area was gradually decreased, with areas east of Roebourne receiving the all clear later on 11 January. The watch area, however, continued to expand and encompassed areas as far east as Denham. As the storm made its closet approach to Western Australia on 13 January, the watches and warnings area were gradually discontinued, with all advisories being discontinued that afternoon.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} Atlantic {{tropical}} <b>cyclone</b> <b>warnings</b> details {{the progress of}} tropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>warnings</b> in the north Atlantic Ocean. The first service {{was set up in}} the 1870s from Cuba with the work of Father Benito Viñes. After his death, hurricane warning services were assumed by the United States Signal Corp and United States Weather Bureau over the next few decades, first based in Jamaica and Cuba before shifting to Washington, D.C.. The central office in Washington, which would evolve into the National Meteorological Center and the Weather Prediction Center, assumed the responsibilities by the early 20th century. This responsibility passed to regional hurricane offices in 1935, and the concept of the Atlantic hurricane season was established in order to keep a vigilant lookout for tropical cyclones during certain times of the year. Hurricane advisories issued every six hours by the regional hurricane offices began at this time.|$|R
5|$|When Gonzalo first formed, various governments {{across the}} eastern Caribbean issued {{tropical}} <b>cyclone</b> <b>warnings</b> and watches, extending from Guadeloupe {{to the coast}} of Puerto Rico. As the storm was strengthening and moving through the region, a hurricane warning was issued for the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, and Saint Martin. Several major cruise lines altered their itineraries to avoid the storm.|$|R
50|$|The Standard Emergency Warning Signal was {{originally}} {{adopted by the}} Bureau of Meteorology in the 1970s for tropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>warnings.</b> It became a standard national emergency warning signal in 1995.
