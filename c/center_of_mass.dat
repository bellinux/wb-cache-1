5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> of the bike and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> and the elevation of the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
5|$|More generally, in {{a closed}} system of particles, all {{internal}} forces are balanced. The particles may accelerate with {{respect to each other}} but the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> of the system will not accelerate. If an external force acts on the system, it will make the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> accelerate in proportion to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.|$|E

5|$|The {{combined}} <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> does move {{slightly to}} the left when the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, and the bike leans to the left in response. The action, in space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by friction between the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> left. This is a small effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E
5|$|The finite {{width of}} the tires alters the actual lean angle of the rear frame from the ideal lean angle {{described}} above. The actual lean angle between the frame and the vertical must increase with tire width and decrease with <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> height. Bikes with fat tires and low <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> must lean more than bikes with skinnier tires or higher centers of mass to negotiate the same turn at the same speed.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{powerful}} motorcycles {{can generate}} enough torque {{at the rear}} wheel to lift the front wheel off {{the ground in a}} maneuver called a wheelie. A line similar to the one described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from the rear wheel contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> location, and sufficient power. This can also happen on bicycles, although there is much less power available, if the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> is back or up far enough or the rider lurches back when applying power to the pedals.|$|E

5|$|The farther forward (closer {{to front}} wheel) the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less the front wheel has to move laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the farther back (closer to the rear wheel) the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> is located, the more front wheel lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, choppers, and wheelie bikes. It can also be a challenge for touring bikes that carry a heavy load of gear over or even behind the rear wheel. Mass over the rear wheel can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over the front wheel.|$|E
5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass)</b> can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass.</b> This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E
5|$|Cluster {{diffusion}} involves {{motion of}} atomic clusters {{ranging in size}} from dimers to islands containing hundreds of atoms. Motion of the cluster may occur via the displacement of individual atoms, sections of the cluster, or the entire cluster moving at once.

Strong repulsion between non-identical particles leads to two new features, respectively when identical particles attract or repel each other. For repulsion new stable structures arise with displaced <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>masses.</b> For attraction the mean-field stability region is restricted due to motion <b>of</b> the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>masses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract The article {{deals with}} the {{kinematics}} of a three section snake-like robot. In {{the introductory part of}} the article, the main advantages and application possibilities of a snake-like movement in practice are mentioned. In the next chapter, the mathematical model of a direct kinematics of a three link snake-like robot was created. It also includes the fourth, variable “virtual ” link. Mathematical model was numerically confirmed in the conclusion. Homogeneous transformational matrices were used for the creation of mathematical model. Subsequently, positional vectors <b>of</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> all links were expressed. For the derivation <b>of</b> velocity vectors <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass,</b> the numerical methods with the application of differential operators were used. In the conclusion of the work, the graphical presentation <b>of</b> the <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> positions is illustrated.

5|$|Evaporation-condensation {{involves}} atoms “evaporating” {{from the}} cluster onto a terrace accompanied by “condensation” of terrace adatoms onto the cluster {{leading to a}} change in the cluster’s <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass.</b> While figure 10 appears to indicate the same atom evaporating from and condensing on the cluster, it may in fact be a different atom condensing from the 2D gas.|$|E
5|$|For {{a sample}} {{motorcycle}} moving at 22m/s (50mph) {{that has a}} front wheel with a moment of inertia of 0.6kg·m2, turning the front wheel one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3.5N·m. In comparison, the lateral force on the front tire as it tracks {{out from under the}} motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50N. This, acting on the 0.6m (2ft) height of the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass,</b> generates a roll moment of 30N·m.|$|E

40|$|We derive, {{from the}} {{dimensional}} cross-over criterion, a fundamental-measure density functional for parallel hard curved rectangles moving on a cylindrical surface. We derive {{it from the}} density functional of circular arcs of length σ with <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> located on an external circumference of radius R_ 0. The latter functional in turns is obtained from the corresponding 2 D functional for a fluid of hard discs of radius R {{on a flat surface}} with <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> confined onto a circumference of radius R_ 0. Thus the curved length of closest approach between two <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> hard discs on this circumference is σ= 2 R_ 0 sin^- 1 (R/R_ 0), the length of the circular arcs. From the density functional of circular arcs, and by applying a dimensional expansion procedure to the spatial dimension orthogonal to the plane of the circumference, we finally obtain the density functional of curved rectangles of edge-lengths σ and L. The DF for curved rectangles can also be obtained by fixing the <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> parallel hard cylinders of radius R and length L on a cylindrical surface of radius R_ 0. The phase behavior of a fluid of aligned curved rectangles is obtained by calculating the free-energy branches of smectic, columnar and crystalline phases for different values of the ratio R_ 0 /R in the range 1 <R_ 0 /R≤ 4; the smectic phase {{turns out to be the}} most stable except for R_ 0 /R= 4 where the crystalline phase becomes reentrant in a small range of packing fractions. When R_ 0 /R< 1 the transition is absent, since the density functional of curved rectangles reduces to the 1 D Percus functional. Comment: 27 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

5|$|With unarticulated wheels, {{climbing}} obstacles {{will cause}} {{the body of a}} vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle will become statically unstable, and will tend to tip over. At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.|$|E
5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E

Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E
