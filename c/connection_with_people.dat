Corbyn rejoined {{that when he}} met Salah, he was unaware {{that he had been}} convicted of racial incitement, and that he had not made antisemitic comments during their conversation about Israel. He also confirmed that he had attended DYR events and made limited cash donations but has [...] "no contact now whatsoever" [...] with the DYR director, previously exposed as a Holocaust denier. Corbyn described Holocaust denial as [...] "obviously vile" [...] and his office released a statement to say he is [...] "proud to represent a multicultural constituency of {{people from all over the}} world and to speak at every opportunity of understanding between Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and other faiths." ...|$|E

This {{was the first}} public intimation that the Caddles' baby, which had begun its earthly career a little under seven pounds, did after all intend to be a credit to its parents. Very soon it was clear {{it meant to be}} not only a credit but a glory. And within a month their glory shone so brightly as to be, in <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> in the Caddles' position, improper.|$|E
60|$|Cope was {{an honest}} young fellow, and shrewd withal. At {{home in his}} quiet rooms in St. Peter's Street, Ivell, he pondered long and unpleasantly on the revelations of the cruise. The tale it told was {{distinct}} enough, {{and for the first}} time his position was an uncomfortable one. He had met the Franklands at Exonbury as parishioners, had been attracted by Frances, and had floated thus far into an engagement which was indefinite only because of his inability to marry just yet. The Franklands' past had apparently contained mysteries, and it did not coincide with his judgment to marry into a family whose mystery was of the sort suggested. So he sat and sighed, between his reluctance to lose Frances and his natural dislike of forming a <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> whose antecedents would not bear the strictest investigation.|$|E

5000|$|A martyr (Greek: μάρτυς, mártys, [...] "witness"; stem μάρτυρ-, mártyr-) {{is someone}} who suffers {{persecution}} and death for advocating, renouncing, refusing to renounce, or refusing to advocate a belief or cause as demanded by an external party. This refusal {{to comply with the}} presented demands results in the punishment or execution of the martyr by the oppressor.

5000|$|The word can be informally {{shortened}} to [...] "hetero". The term straight originated as a mid-20th century gay slang {{term for}} heterosexuals, ultimately {{coming from the}} phrase [...] "to go straight" [...] (as in [...] "straight and narrow"), or stop engaging in homosexual sex. One of the first uses of the word in this way was in 1941 by author G. W. Henry. Henry's book concerned conversations with homosexual males and used this term in <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> who are identified as ex-gays. It is now simply a colloquial term for [...] "heterosexual", having changed in primary meaning over time. Some object to usage of the term straight because it implies that non-heteros are crooked.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{invasion}} of Poland in 1939, Nazi reports of sexual relations between Polish women and German soldiers brought about a directive issued for the press to promulgate that the links between Poles and Germans brought about a decline in German blood, and that any <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> of Polish extraction was dangerous. The press was to describe Poles as {{on the same level}} as Jews and Gypsies in order to discourage association. The Nazi German government on 8 March 1940 issued the Polish decrees with regard to the Polish forced laborer workers in Germany stated that any Pole [...] "who has sexual relations with a German man or woman, or approaches them in any other improper manner, will be punished by death." ...|$|E
5000|$|Chapter 2 explores whether left liberal {{values of}} universalism and {{compassion}} for {{all human beings}} are compatible with patriotism, which feels {{a higher level of}} <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> of the same country. Soutphommasane argues that the left side of politics in Australia used to be patriotic, but that this declined in the 1960s and has given way to a suspicion of nationalistic feelings. The author concludes that there no necessary contradiction. Soutphommasane writes that [...] "A distinctive brand of egalitarianism, a robust democracy supported by an Anzac myth - these are the foundations of an Australian patriotism". He also argues that progressive criticisms of Australia and its history are compatible with patriotism as a more sophisticated love of one’s country involves acknowledging its faults as well as celebrating its virtues.|$|E

50|$|Nah Inverness, {{published}} in 2004, likewise features two diary accounts. One is by Hal Dumblatt, an American director hell-bent on filming {{a production of}} Macbeth in the Yemeni hinterlands, using Yemeni tribesmen as actors. The second narrative strand is provided by Ahmed, a Yemeni officer appointed {{to report on the}} film crew's activities. The novel's plot is based on real events: Michael Roes took a small film crew to Yemen in 2000 to film a version of Macbeth, entitled Someone is Sleeping in my Pain: Ein west-östlicher Macbeth (2001). This daring project can only be viewed as the epitome of the experimentation, and an eagerness to approach the unknown, that is inherent in Roes' work as a whole. Of all Roes' works the novel is, however, the least optimistic about the possibilities of making a successful and meaningful <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> from different cultures.|$|E
50|$|Social and {{information}} structure: Originally, Q&A communities have little structural or role-based organization. In recent years, {{we found that}} some communities started to form social {{and information}} structures. This {{is driven by the}} increasing number of contributors and the adoption of new features as mentioned above. Research shows that there are three different connection networks (or graphs) inside communities such as Quora. A graph connecting topics to users, a social graph connecting users, and a graph connecting related questions. These connections help users find the topic that they are looking for and build a social <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> sharing the same interests. Also, as contributors gather according to a common theme, their votes help to screen out the domain expert and the high quality questions in that field. Also, the heterogeneity in the user and question graphs are significant contributors {{to the quality of the}} community's knowledge base.|$|E
5000|$|Lyrically, [...] "Coyote" [...] is {{concerned}} with the difficulty of establishing any sort of <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> who come from [...] "different sets of circumstance" [...] (as the song has it). In particular it describes an encounter (which turns into a one-night stand) between the narrator (possibly meant to be Mitchell herself as there is a reference in the lyrics to her coming home from the studio) and [...] "Coyote", a ranch worker. In Chris O'Dell's 2009 autobiography Miss O'Dell she details an affair she had with married playwright Sam Shepard and states that Shepard then cheated on her with Joni Mitchell. O'Dell claims that [...] "Coyote" [...] is written about Sam Shepard. Coyote represents nature contrasted with the narrator's big city (presumably LA) life where [...] "pills and powders" [...] are necessary to [...] "get them through this passion play". The aforementioned line is also a reference to Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue, which Mitchell was a part of in the fall of 1975.|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, {{municipal}} stakeholders {{were confronted}} with the unexpected existence of many structural holes and brokerage positions. The concepts “brokerage” and “structural hole” refer to actors’ structural embeddedness. A person who maintains <b>connections</b> <b>with</b> <b>people,</b> who do themselves not become interconnected, {{has the ability to}} mediate between these contacts and to obtain benefits from his brokerage position [19 – 21]. At the same time, structural holes impede innovation processes and information flows.|$|R
