50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>tody-flycatcher</b> or black-fronted tody-flycatcher (Todirostrum cinereum) is a {{very small}} {{passerine}} bird in the tyrant flycatcher family. It breeds from southern Mexico to northwestern Peru, eastern Bolivia and southern Brazil.|$|E
50|$|The Maracaibo tody-flycatcher (Todirostrum viridanum), {{also known}} as the short-tailed tody-flycatcher, is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae.It is endemic to arid scrub in the region near Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela. It has {{formerly}} been considered a subspecies of the <b>common</b> <b>tody-flycatcher,</b> which it resembles.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{very common}} {{inhabitant}} in gardens, shady plantations, second growth and the edges and clearings of forest, although it avoids the dense interior of mature woodland and also arid areas. The <b>common</b> <b>tody-flycatcher</b> is usually seen in pairs, making rapid dashing sallies or hovering to pick small arthropods off the vegetation. It often wags its tail as it moves sideways along branches.|$|E
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>tody-flycatcher</b> is a tiny, big-headed bird, 9.5 - 10.2 cm long, {{weighing}} 6.5 - 6.8 g, {{and with}} a long, flattened, straight black bill. The upper head is black, shading to dark grey on the nape and dark olive-green {{on the rest of}} the upperparts. The usually cocked tail is black with white tips, and the wings are blackish with two yellow wing bars and yellow edging to the feathers. The underparts are entirely yellow. Sexes are similar, but young birds have a greyer upper head, buff wing markings, and paler underparts.|$|E
30|$|We amplified and sequenced borer DNA {{from the}} feces of six species: Buff-throated Foliage-Gleaner (Passeriformes: Furnariidae Automolus ochrolaemus; {{detected}} in 1 of 8 samples), <b>Common</b> <b>Tody-Flycatcher</b> (Passeriformes: Tyrannidae Todirostrum cinereum; 1 of 4), Rufous-breasted Wren (Passeriformes: Troglodytidae Pheugopedius rutilus; 1 of 18), Rufous-capped Warbler (Passeriformes: Parulidae Basileuterus rufifrons; 5 of 66), White-tailed Emerald (Apodiformes: Trochilidae Elvira chionura; 1 of 2), and Yellow Warbler (Passeriformes: Parulidae Setophaga petechia; 1 of 26). The majority of detections (8 of 10) {{were derived from}} surveys conducted in 2010 and reported in Karp et al. (2013), even though fewer samples were collected in 2010 (478 vs. 961 samples). In total, 30 (Jaramillo et al. primers) and 27 (our developed primers) samples yielded PCR products of the expected size range, 4 and 6 of which were > 98 % sequence similar to borers.|$|E
