40|$|Abstract The aim of {{calculating the}} costs more {{accurately}} with less deviation and managing the costs in businesses is increasing. This {{is more important}} in production businesses.

The aim {{of this study is to}} compare business costs and the methods used in calculating these costs on the one hand, and tax laws and recognition within the scope of Turkish Accounting Standard (TAS- 2) on the other hand. This standard explains what should be considered in determining costs. In addition, this standard shows what will be the production and stock cost calculation method and how they will be reported. As a result of the study, it is seen that there are different results when full cost and variable cost methods are used. It is seen that in full cost method all expenses are added to the cost. This complies with legal regulations however it causes to an increase in the calculated costs.

40|$|AbstractThe primary {{objective}} of the study {{presented in this paper}} is to develop design curves for performance prediction of stabilized layers and to compare semi-rigid flexible pavement designs between the empirical AASHTO 1993 and the mechanistic-empirical pavement design methodologies.

It is found that the design thickness is influenced by the type of soil, additive, selection of material property and design method. <b>Cost</b> comparisons of <b>sections</b> stabilized with different percentage and type of additives showed that CKD-stabilization provides economically low <b>cost</b> <b>sections</b> as compared to lime- and CFA-stabilized sections.

40|$|There is no unique {{answer to}} the {{question}} of what an ongoing program costs in medical schools. The estimates of program costs generated by classical methods of cost accounting are unsatisfactory because such accounting cannot deal with the joint production or joint cost problem. Activity analysis models aim at calculating the impact of alternative combinations of school activities. As now practiced, activity analysis yields the incremental cost of an activity given all other school activities, that is, pure program costs. Such analysis is a potentially useful management tool. Input/output analysis is a special form of activity analysis in which some activities provide both final outputs and input into other activities.
