40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to review the U. S. Army Reserve (USAR) {{recruiting}} process, to analyze unit cost resourcing at the U. S.

First, we identify the limitations of using unit cost for evaluating and improving USAREC's fiscal performance and as a management tool to allocate resources. Our analysis concludes that <b>current</b> unit <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> at USAREC does not provide the proper incentives to cut costs nor the information needed to achieve economic efficiency. Second, we introduce a life cycle cost effectiveness model to compare alternative USAR accession policies. The model uses historical data of soldier attrition and promotion behavior coupled with estimates of recruiting, training and compensation costs to determine life cycle costs of various accession policies. For the data used, prior service (PS) soldiers had lower attrition rates and were more cost-effective over a seven year life cycle than non-prior service (NPS) soldiers. High quality NPS soldiers showed similar results when compared with low quality NPS soldiers. We recommend that USAREC and the USAR use marginal life cycle cost analysis when making manpower procurement decisions and allocating resources. NANAU. S. Army (USA) autho...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cost</b> <b>accounting</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{information}} for the management in the company. A correctly designed <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system may address the most important issues in order to support effective and successful decision-making, which among others include price building, efficiency measurement and profit evaluation. In order to enable the full functioning of the system the company should ensure that the system is designed according to the company’s size, operations and processes, as well as information needs. For Testo Sensor GmbH the optimization of <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system became essential, as the information it provides at the moment is not sufficient and reliable for decision-making. Obviously, the reason for this is that the system was not correctly and thoroughly designed at the times of the company foundation. Therefore, the goal of current paper is to develop and adjust the <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system to the company’s operations in order to fulfill the information needs. In order to reach this goal the following objectives were defined:  to analyze the <b>current</b> state of <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system of Testo Sensor  to reveal its weaknesses and incompatibilities  to address these incompatibilities by developing the improvements and possible optimization potentials In order to fulfill these objectives, the review of the German and English literature on the current topic was made in order to identify possible approaches and methods and provide a theoretical background for solutions of the existent problem. In addition to this, a number of interviews was held with the employees of Testo Sensor, as well as the parent company.

40|$|Purpose-The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{implement}} an integrated activity-based costing (ABC) and theory of constraints (TOC) approach to enhance decision making in a Lean company. Design/methodology/approach-Based on the literature, this paper proposes an integrated ABC and TOC approach and applies it to a Lean plastic manufacturing company to improve its product-mix decision. Findings-The results of the case study show that the current conventional product-mix decision used by the company and the proposed integrated approach can give significantly different results concerning the optimal product-mix and the associated bottlenecks. Moreover, the paper suggests that managers who implement Lean production without utilising a supportive management accounting system may experience disappointing financial results. Research limitations/implications-The validation of the suggested method is based on a single case study with an action research approach. For future research, the authors suggest the implementation of the approach in different industries. Practical implications-Overall, the integration of ABC and TOC provides managers with an accurate, timely and reliable tool that can help in making decisions about pricing, production line development, process improvements and product-mix. Originality/value-This paper contributes to Lean and management accounting literature by demonstrating the value of a method of integrating ABC and TOC. Also a case study is chosen for the empirical aspect of the study as there are no case studies available in the literature that illustrate a real life case of integrating ABC and TOC within Lean companies as an alternative to the <b>current</b> used <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> systems...|$|R

40|$|This paper recasts an old {{debate in}} accounting, {{that of the}} {{appropriate}} means of revaluing assets in place, within a new theoretical and empirical framework. The new theoretical framework is to regard the current movement of <b>current</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> indices as reflecting inter-industry arbitrage of both assets in place and investment. This new perspective results in a new empirical development which draws upon recent advances in time-series econometrics, namely, error correction representations of the trajectory of related time-series. We construct error correction representations of both the current-cost and the current purchasing power method of valuing assets in place and compare them according {{to their ability to}} forecast the future value of assets in place.

40|$|Abstract This study {{assesses the}} {{influence}} of discretionary accounting changes on financial analysts' individual forecast errors in the Netherlands from 1988 to 1999. It contributes to previous research by examining whether accounting changes (1) influence analysts' earnings forecast accuracy; and (2) change analysts' forecasting superiority relative to a mechanical earnings prediction model because {{of the change in}} the time series and composition of earnings. The empirical results indicate that changes in accounting procedures can significantly affect analysts' forecast accuracy and forecasting advantage, conditional on the change-year effect, prior disclosure and the type of change. Specifically, this study finds that in the year that firms adopt accounting changes with a material effect on earnings before extraordinary items, analysts' forecast accuracy significantly worsens if the changes have not been previously disclosed. Further, in the earliest years after the adoption of changes from <b>current</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> to historical cost accounting and changes from expensing to capitalization analysts' forecast accuracy and forecast superiority significantly improves, whereas analysts' forecast accuracy and superiority significantly worsens after the adoption of other changes.

The data were collected using the hospital's <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system and then compared with the estimates provided by the DRG reimbursement schedule for similar conditions. Main outcome measures and results: The estimated costs were 849 euro (EUR) for coronary angiography, EUR 4762 for coronary angioplasty with stenting, and EUR 4978 to 8067 for MI. The DRG reimbursement schedule provided for acute MI was EUR 3920 to 5709.
