50|$|On 1 July 2015, a {{simplified}} universal charging system was introduced for 084 numbers {{and all other}} 'service numbers'. Calls to all 084 numbers now consist of a 'service charge' of up to 7p per minute and/or 7p per call, plus a standard 'access charge' set by the caller's own phone company which typically ranges from 7p to 45p per minute. The total <b>call</b> <b>cost</b> therefore typically ranges from 7p to 52p per minute.|$|E
50|$|The {{differences}} between the prefixes are {{the length of the}} number (six or ten digits), the license cost to use them each year (approximately A$1 for 1800 and 1300, A$10,000 for 13 numbers) and the <b>call</b> <b>cost</b> model. 1300 numbers and 13 numbers share call costs between the caller and call recipient, whereas the 1800 model offers a national free call to the caller, with total costs of the call borne by the recipient.|$|E

Private GSM delivers {{many of the}} benefits demanded by enterprises; delivering <b>call</b> <b>cost</b> savings, assisting time critical decisions by improving reach, and ensuring that compliance legislations can be met. These benefits only come alive when enterprises are able to highlight real-life advantages through actual private GSM deployments.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Smash Hits on 8 May 1985, Richard Anthony Hewson said that the song {{took place in the}} future where there was a 100-year long war on Mars. In regards to the phone call featured in the song, Hewson said that it was [...] "much more difficult to make these calls since British Telecom was privatized." [...] Hewson also mentioned that the phone <b>call</b> <b>cost</b> about [...] "five million six hundred and forty thousand pounds and forty pence." [...] The vocals were performed by Hewson's wife Liz.|$|E
50|$|In the future, it {{is likely}} that users of 084 and 087 numbers will have to declare the service charge element of the <b>call</b> <b>cost</b> when {{advertising}} their phone number, whilst telecoms companies will need to inform their customers about their access charge for calling each number range. Additionally, the EU Consumer Rights Directive requires that many entities that held 084 and 087 numbers will no longer be allowed to use them. The directive bans the usage of numbers that cost more than calling a geographic number for customer service and complaints lines, and other such purposes.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, the 118500 service run by BT {{was fined}} £225 000 by PhonepayPlus (now renamed as the Phone-paid Services Authority) for over-charging {{customers}} {{and failing to}} clearly display <b>call</b> <b>costs.</b> BT were also ordered to refund affected customers.|$|R

5000|$|Advice of Charge (AoC). This GSM service {{estimates}} the <b>call</b> <b>cost</b> for display on the user's mobile phone. This helps users by preventing bill shock {{and reduces the}} load on the mobile network operator's customer service department. However, in practice, this GSM service is rarely used because the calculation {{is more complex than}} the standard allows. Instead, some operators provide subscribers with balance and/or call-cost notifications sent at predetermined times, such as at the beginning or end of every call. These notifications may be read out loud using a speech-synthesis system, or may be transmitted in textual form.|$|E
50|$|The suite {{consisted}} of two principal components, Connect, which interfaced with the modem driver or LAN, and Turnpike, which controlled, sorted and displayed news articles and email. The Connect window also provided telnet, finger, ping, and traceroute functions, <b>call</b> <b>cost</b> monitoring for dialup connections, and, in earlier versions and those upgraded therefrom, Ipswitch's WS_FTP; it had up to 20 buttons which linked to these functions and any other application the user chose to configure (by default including Internet Explorer). Prior to version 6 the Turnpike component was a stand-alone executable whilst from version 6 onwards it was implemented as a Windows Shell namespace extension. Mail filtering was done using Unix-like regular expressions. It used the Berkeley mailbox format for the export and import of email files.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to {{concerns about the}} continuing abuse of 0870 numbers, Ofcom announced in 2008 that higher charges for 0870 numbers could remain provided {{that there was an}} announcement before the call. However, since that announcement Ofcom changed its decision, citing technical difficulties relating to alarm systems, some of which are life critical and due to strong lobbying and pressure from the telecoms industry. From 2009, the ability of organisations using 0870 numbers to receive a proportion of the <b>call</b> <b>cost</b> was removed. However, the cost of calling such numbers continued to vary considerably; some landline tariffs now included 0870 numbers in inclusive allowances, while mobile operators charged a premium for calling such numbers. Many organisations changed to using other 084 and 087 numbers through which they could continue to receive an income from call costs.|$|E
