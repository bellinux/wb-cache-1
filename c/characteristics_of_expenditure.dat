The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the relationship between household availability of processed and ultra-processed products and the prevalence of excess weight (overweight plus obesity) and obesity in Brazil. Methods: The study was based on data from the 2008 – 2009 Household Budget Survey involving a probabilistic sample of 55, 970 Brazilian households. The units of study were household aggregates (strata), geographically and socioeconomically homogeneous. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between the availability of processed and ultra-processed products and the average of Body Mass Index (BMI) and the percentage of individuals with excess weight and obesity in the strata, controlling for potential confounders (socio-demographic <b>characteristics,</b> percentage <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> on eating out of home, and dietary energy other than that provided by processed and ultra-processed products). Predictive values for prevalence of excess weight and obesity were estimated according to quartiles of the household availability of dietary energy from processed and ultra-processed products.

40|$|This report uses {{data from}} the Community Innovation Survey to explore {{expenditures}} on innovation by European firms. It analyses the level and structure of three types of innovation investment across European industry: R&D, non-R&D expenditures (such as design activities), and capital investments linked to the innovation of new products. Although we have long had good data on R&D, we have lacked data on the other main categories <b>of</b> innovation <b>expenditure.</b> This is a serious problem, since {{one of the most}} important themes of modern innovation analysis has been the importance of non-R&D inputs to innovation. A related issue is expenditure on the acquisition of capital and intermediate goods, embodying new technologies. This type of investment, which is linked to both product and process change, has long been recognised as a key ‘carrier’ of technological advance. After discussing the data itself, we provide in Chapter One a general overview of the structure and <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> innovation <b>expenditures</b> across European industry. We then turn, in Chapter Two and Three to a more technical analysis of the data. The analysis seeks to explore two main issues: Can we identify industry-specific features of the level <b>of</b> innovation <b>expenditures</b> in European? That is to say, when we look at an industry, is the extent or intensity <b>of</b> innovation <b>expenditure</b> consistent across countries in Europe, or do these levels vary across countries? How does the composition of innovation inputs vary across industries, and is such variation consistent across countries in Europe? One of the basic problems for European innovation policy is to distinguish between the appropriate levels for policy action. What, for example, should be the tasks or areas of responsibility of the European Commission vis-a-vis the Member States? Such questions depend on the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> innovation processes in Europe. Do industries in Europe have significant features in common? Is the structure of innovation inputs similar in the same industry across Europe? Or are there country-specific features (perhaps reflecting different national innovation systems) ? If there is a common European level, then we may be able to identify - at least in a broad way – commonalities of innovation input where problems may arise which are appropriate arenas for European action. On the other hand, if innovation at industry level is characterised by strong country-specific features, then policies directed to specific industries or activities might best be undertaken at Member State level. This data strongly shows the importance of industry-level effects, rather than country-level effects: European industries appear to have strong commonalities in terms <b>of</b> innovation <b>expenditures.</b> ...|$|R

An econometric model is developed that combines both macroeconomic data and socio-economic information derived from over 1, 000 visitor interviews. This allows us to control for individual characteristics and estimate the derived elasticities for the macroeconomic determinants <b>of</b> <b>expenditure.</b> The findings suggest that socio-economic <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> individuals may be more significant than macroeconomic indicators in explaining variations in visitor expenditure. Among individual <b>characteristics,</b> the region <b>of</b> origin, length of stay, type of accommodation, type <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> and personal income are associated with the level of per capita visitor expenditure. This should assist regional policy formulation in attracting higher spending visitors and thereby maximising the income and employment benefits from sporting events and other areas of tourism...|$|R

The numbers of districts entering the analyses, depending on grade level and test, varied from 261 to 507. SES accounted for much of the accountable variance; higher SES districts, of course, achieved more than lower SES districts. When SES was taken into account, higher expenditures were inconsistently and generally insignificantly (probability less than 0. 05) associated with lower test scores; and students in smaller districts generally achieved more than those in larger districts. The inefficiency <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> and diseconomies <b>of</b> scale in raising achievement are contrary to popular and considerable opinion but corroborate previous research. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the possible association of achievement test scores in more than 500 districts in New Jersey to their levels <b>of</b> SES, <b>expenditures</b> per stu-dent, and student enrollments.

Only limited empirical knowledge is available on the determinants <b>of</b> these <b>expenditures.</b> OBJECTIVES: In this paper we analyze which <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> private households influence out-of-pocket pharmaceutical expenditure (OOPPE) in Austria. DESIGN & METHODS: We use cross-sectional information on OOPPE and on household characteristics provided by the Austrian household budget survey 2009 / 10. We split pharmaceutical expenditures into the two components prescription fees and over-the-counter (OTC) expenditures. To adjust for the specific <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> the data we compare different econometric approaches: two-part model, hurdle model, generalized linear model, zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. FINDINGS: The finally selected econometric approaches give a quite consistent picture. The probability <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> <b>of</b> both types is strongly influenced by the household structure. It increases with age, doctoral visits and the presence of a female householder. The education level and income only increase the probability of OTC-pharmaceuticals. The level of OTC-expenditures remains widely unexplained while the household structure and age influences the expenditures for prescription fees. Insurance <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> private households either private or public play a minor role in explaining the expenditure levels in all specifications. This refers to a homogenous and comprehensive provision of pharmaceuticals in the public part of the Austrian health care system. CONCLUSIONS: The paper gives useful insights into the determinants <b>of</b> pharmaceutical <b>expenditures</b> <b>of</b> private households and supplements the previous research which focuses on the individual level...|$|R

Therefore, the water service program needs to be adapted to the conditions of each region, supported with complete data. In this regard, {{this study was conducted}} aimed to assess the pattern on {{drinking water}} management in Indonesia, according to regional characteristics, economic status, and drinking-water facilities. The study was a cross sectional study by using Riskesdas 2007 data. The sample of study were all households sampled in Riskesdas 2007. The results showed that factors which influenced the pattern were regional <b>characteristics,</b> level <b>of</b> household <b>expenditures,</b> physical quality <b>of</b> drinking water, allocated time and distance to the source of water as well as the ease of getting drinking water. Households in urban areas were known to be more protective as compared to those in rural areas against pattern that was less well. The higher <b>of</b> household <b>expenditures,</b> has caused te lower risk. Finally, households which were difficult to get drinking water in the year and time allocation to get clean water was more than 30 minutes, would have risk of 1. 807 times and 1, 234 times to have less well pattern...|$|R
