50|$|A {{synchronous}} motor {{may have a}} squirrel-cage winding embedded in its rotor, used to increase the motor starting torque and so decrease the time to accelerate to synchronous speed. The squirrel <b>cage</b> <b>winding</b> of a synchronous machine will generally be smaller than for an induction machine of similar rating. When the rotor is turning {{at the same speed}} as the stator's revolving magnetic field, no current is induced into the squirrel-cage windings and the windings will have no further effect on the operation of the {{synchronous motor}} at steady-state.|$|E

Spray penetration is hindered by the structure of the <b>cage.</b> <b>Wind</b> tunnel studies were conducted to investigate the accuracy of those calculations developed to correct for filtration levels in caged mosquito bioassays. Zenivex E 20 (Etofenprox) was applied at rates ranging from an LD 10 to an LD 90. Three cage types were used, each with different penetration levels. The dose approaching the cage was converted to the dose entering the cage using cage penetration data from previous research. The penetration conversion factor returned a data set that directly correlated dose with mosquito mortality (R 2 = = 0. 918). The mortality percent was a function of the dose within the cage. The mesh type acted as a regulator. Although the conversion factor was effective, the differences between cages was not always significant due to within-group variation...|$|R

The use of hives resulted in 98 - 100 % fruit set, but fruit size did not improve significantly, remaining far below that achieved by hand pollination (66 g versus 108 g, the first year; 78 g versus 119 g, the second year). The short flowering period, the frequent adverse weather conditions, and the unpredictable foraging efficiency of bee colonies, made both wind and honey bees inadequate for kiwifruit pollination.

40|$|As {{part of a}} NASA {{initiative}} to reduce helicopter main rotor noise, a Phase 1 study has been performed of candidate noise reduction concepts. Both conventional and novel design technologies have been analyzed that reduce the community impact of helicopter operations. In this study the noise reduction potential and design implications are assessed for conventional means of noise reduction, e. g., tip speed reduction, tip shapes and airfoil tailoring, and for two innovative design concepts: modulated blade spacing and x-force control. Main rotor designs that incorporate modulated blade spacing are shown to have reduced peak noise levels in most flight operations. X-force control alters the helicopter's force balance whereby the miss distance between main rotor blades and shed vortices can be controlled. This control provides a high potential to mitigate BVI noise radiation. Each concept is evaluated using best practice design and analysis methods, achieving the study's aim to significantly reduce noise with minimal performance degradation and no vibration increase. It is concluded that a SILENT main rotor design, incorporating the modulated blade spacing concept, offers significantly reduced noise levels and the potential of a breakthrough in how a helicopter's sound is perceived and judged. The SILENT rotor represents a definite advancement in the state-of-the-art and is selected as the design concept for demonstration in Phase 2.

40|$|The {{open-ended}} winding {{induction machine}} fed from a standard two-level Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) arrangement {{is an attractive}} solution for AC drives. An alternative power converter approach is to use an Indirect Matrix Converter (IMC) consisting of a matrix converter AC-DC input stage and two VSI output stages. This latter topology provides fully bidirectional power flow operation and requires only a small input filter. In this paper, a vector control strategy for an open-ended <b>winding</b> <b>cage</b> induction machine fed by a two-output IMC is presented. The modulation scheme for the input power converter stage aims to modify the virtual DC link voltage depending on the load voltage requirement. Additionally, the modulation strategy for the dual-inverter output aims to eliminate the zero sequence voltage applied to the load. A vector control scheme is used and the full system is modelled using a PSIM and MATLAB/Simulink platform.

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} wind {{energy into the}} power grid, researchers have started focusing more on control and coordination of wind energy conversion systems (WECS) with the other components at system level, especially during fault. It is important to implement a suitable fault ride through control strategy to avoid tripping of the generators when the power system is subjected to voltage dips normally below 90 % of nominal voltage.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} a high penetration of Squirrel <b>Cage</b> Induction Generator <b>wind</b> turbines (SCIGs) on the voltage regulation and reactive power compensation on a grid. It shows that SCIGs slow down voltage restoration after a voltage drop and can lead to voltage and rotor speed instability. When the voltage is restored, SCIGs will absorb reactive power and, if the voltage does not return quickly enough, the generator accelerates and consumes larger amounts of reactive power. This situation is exacerbated if the wind turbine is connected to a weak power system. A static synchronous compensator (STATCOM), can be utilised to maintain the voltage profile and to overcome a transient disturbance after faults. However, existing STATCOMs utilise fixed gain PI controllers that are unable to respond when the system is under extreme conditions such as a three phase to ground fault, sudden wind speed changes, load fluctuations and weak grid support. Therefore, in this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) based self-tuning PI controller is proposed. Simulation studies were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller in maintaining the system stability under such conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWorld's largest DNI {{measurement}} {{network of}} 51 automatic meteorological stations with solar radiation instruments fulfilling the highest commercially available standards is operating in India. The Indian Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) in 2011 started this extensive solar resource monitoring cum meteorological station network under the Solar Radiation Resource Assessment (SRRA) project. This paper highlights the overall {{performance of the}} stations over {{more than one year}} and documents the specific problems and errors observed in field operation. Following best practices quality assessment tests, a data flagging system to identify, differentiate and quantify different types of errors and other functionalities have been implemented as part of the SolMap project. The quality assessment tests check the plausibility of data, differentiate trustworthy data from likely erroneous data and flag them accordingly. The quality flag statistics of all 51 stations reveals that some stations are performing very well and others need more attention to improve. In the period from January 2012 to March 2013 on an average over all 51 stations, 92 % of the solar radiation data are classified as correct. The quality control system has proven to be very effective for detecting errors in functionality of the stations. Values flagged erroneous along with missing values are considered as gaps. Many applications such as solar energy performance simulations need continuous time-series. Therefore it is required to fill the measurement gaps with reasonable data. This paper also describes a set of procedures called ‘basic gap filling’ for solar irradiance. The accuracy of the applied basic gap filling methodology is tested and the results show a mean bias of ca. 3 % over GHI, DNI and DHI over all types of gaps. Automated alarms, sensor cleaning switch, bird protection <b>cages</b> for <b>wind</b> sensors etc. are some of the efforts SRRA took for smoother operation. Regular cleaning of the radiometers remains the most challenging task for the SRRA network...|$|R
