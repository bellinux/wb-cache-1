40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors' {{goal was}} to {{validate}} the clinical <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia of the State of California Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (ADDTC), the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN), DSM-IV, and ICD- 10. METHOD: Sensitivity and specificity were assessed by comparing the clinical with the neuropathological diagnosis of 89 autopsied patients with dementia from a geriatric and psychiatric hospital. All cases were reviewed by a clinician and a neuropathologist who were blind to each other's findings. RESULTS: Neuropathologically there were 20 cases of vascular dementia, 23 cases of mixed dementia, and 46 cases of Alzheimer's disease among the autopsied patients. The sensitivity was 0. 50 <b>for</b> DSM-IV <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia, 0. 70 <b>for</b> ADDTC <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> possible vascular dementia, 0. 55 <b>for</b> NINDS-AIREN <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> possible vascular dementia, 0. 20 <b>for</b> ICD- 10 <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia, 0. 25 <b>for</b> ADDTC <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> probable vascular dementia, and 0. 20 <b>for</b> NINDS-AIREN <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> probable vascular dementia. Specificity was 0. 84, 0. 78, 0. 84, 0. 94, 0. 91, and 0. 93, respectively. The proportion of cases clinically classified as vascular dementia ranged from 0 % to 13 % for neuropathologically confirmed cases of Alzheimer's disease and 9 % to 39 % for neuropathologically confirmed cases of mixed dementia. There was no statistically significant relationship between the neuropathological diagnosis {{and three of the}} clinical criteria sets studied (ICD- 10 <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia and ADDTC and NINDS-AIREN <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> probable vascular dementia). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia are not interchangeable. The ADDTC <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> possible vascular dementia are the most sensitive for the detection of vascular dementia; however, the DSM-IV <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia and the NINDS-AIREN <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> possible vascular dementia may be more effective in excluding mixed dementia. Given their inability to detect the vast majority of cases of vascular dementia, the ICD- 10 <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia and the ADDTC and NINDS-AIREN <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> probable vascular dementia should be revised...|$|R

To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} the diagnostic <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) and microscopic polyangiitis (mPA) proposed by Sørensen et al. in the classification of primary systemic vasculitis (PSV). Methods. We applied to our cohort of PSV patients the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> WG, Churg–Strauss syndrome (CSS) and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) definitions for WG, mPA and CSS, the Hammersmith <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> CSS and the Sørensen <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> WG and mPA. Results. Ninety-nine PSV cases were identified. Fifty-six fulfilled <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> WG (ACR), 60 for PAN (ACR) and 15 for CSS (ACR). Four fulfilled the Hammersmith <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> CSS. Thirty-nine were defined as mPA (CHCC). Fifty-three patients fulfilled the Sørensen <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> WG and three for mPA. Five of six patients classified as WG (ACR) who did not meet the Sørensen criteria were excluded by eosinophilia. Six patients who did not fulfil WG (ACR) met the Sørensen <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> WG. Conclusion. The classification of systemic vasculitis is complicated and many cases fulfil mor...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recently, the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) {{published}} {{an adaptation of}} the previous United Kingdom Brain Bank Society (UKBBS) <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD).

RESULTS: The recently introduced MDS <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> the clinical diagnosis of iPD include useful novel features (e. g. postural instability is no longer listed as a cardinal symptom, familiar history of iPD and intake of neuroleptics at the first visit no longer lead to exclusion of the diagnosis) and red flags do not lead to exclusion of the diagnosis; however, they must be counterbalanced by the presence of supportive <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> iPD. The <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> identification of persons in the prodromal stage are currently established only for scientific investigations.

5|$|Brown {{thinks that}} no matter where it is speculated to be, if Planet Nine exists, then its mass is higher than what is {{required}} to clear its feeding zone in 4.6 billion years, and thus that it dominates {{the outer edge of}} the Solar System, which is sufficient to make it a planet by current definitions.

Prior to the warning, Arlene had satisfied the <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> a tropical storm watch as a developing tropical depression. However, the NHC and various National Weather Service forecast offices opted to delay the watch {{as a result of the}} poorly organized appearance of the cyclone at the time. Given the weak nature of Arlene and the relatively unpopulated extent of coast which it impacted, evacuations were minimal – only fifteen fled from summer homes along Magnolia Beach and Indianola, Texas due to the threat of flooding.|$|E

5|$|The {{inclusion}} of specific Final Fantasy characters {{was based on}} the opinions of both fans and staff. Another <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> inclusion was whether the staff felt the characters would fit into the storyline and in the Kingdom Hearts universe. Initially, Nomura was hesitant to use characters he did not design, because he was unfamiliar with the backstory of such characters. For Kingdom Hearts II, he changed his mind after receiving pressure from his staff. Throughout the development of the games, Nomura has often left certain events and connections between characters unexplained until the release of future games. Nomura does this because he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate and use their imagination. He has stated that with speculation, even though a game gets old, people can still be happy with it.|$|E
