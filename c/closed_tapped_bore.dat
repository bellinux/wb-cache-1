40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess availability and adequacy of domestic water supply in Tsaunin Kura community of Kaduna metropolis Nigeria, between May and December 2009 using structured questionnaire. The study populations were household members living in the study area. Two hundred (200) respondents were randomly selected with 74 % responses. Majority of the respondents, 38. 5 % and 90 % were civil servants and females respectively. Their commonest source of water supply was well (41 %) which is inadequate in 74 % of cases due to the seasonal variation of their water content. Other sources of water included <b>tap</b> <b>bore</b> hole and purchase of water from vendors. About 41 % of the respondents spend N 2000 ($ 13) on buying water for home use daily and 62. 4 % store water in drum/bucket/galloon. Cleaning of the storage facilities were done once in a year in majority of cases (54 %). A significant percentage (48 %) does not treat their water before using it. On the medical history, 74 % claimed to have had illness (68 % of such was typhoid fever) which they believed was from the poor quality of water they are using and 68 % were treated in the hospital...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a machine learning approach to large-scale monitoring for malicious activities on Internet. In the proposed system, network packets sent from a subnet to a darknet (i. e., {{a set of}} unused IPs) are collected, and they are transformed into 27 -dimensional TAP (Traffic Analysis Profile) feature vectors. Then, a hierarchical clustering is performed to obtain clusters for typical malicious behaviors. In the monitoring phase, the malicious activities in a subnet are estimated from the <b>closest</b> <b>TAP</b> feature cluster. Then, such TAP feature clusters for all subnets are visualized on the proposed monitoring system in real time. In the experiment, we use a big data set of 303, 733, 994 darknet packs collected from February 1 st to February 28 th, 2014 (28 days) for monitoring. As a result, we can successfully detect {{an indication of the}} pandemic of a new malware, which attacked to the vulnerability of Synology NAS (port 5, 000 /TCP) ...|$|R

The axial electric field was measured by pairs of voltage leads brought out in a plane perpendicular to the tape axis, turned axially to meet and so led out to a voltmeter. The spatial variation and the current dependence of the electric field, obtained from several pairs of <b>taps</b> <b>closed</b> at different radial positions, {{were consistent with the}} prediction for a uniform superconducting thin rectangle with a critical current Ic rather than a superconductor of elliptical cross-section.

40|$|Mandibular {{condylar}} {{motion in}} patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) has not been fully examined during open-close and anteroposterior jaw movement. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate this motion in such patients. Using a six-degrees-of-freedom jaw movement recording system, movement of a lower central incisor point and hinge axis of the condyles 20 mm medial from the skin on the right and left sides were calculated during voluntary open-close jaw movement and anteroposter- ior movement of the joint. The data were recorded for eleven patients with unilateral TMD (TMD group) and eleven control group subjects without temporomandibular disorders but whose occlusal condition otherwise almost matched that of the TMD group. The condylar points in the sagittal plane were mathematically calculated by solving the most minimized point of the moving distance around the condyle on the sagittal plane on each side when minor jaw opening and <b>closing</b> <b>tapping</b> movement was parformed for 10 seconds. During open-close jaw movement, there were no significant differences between the TMD and control groups due to a large SD in all measurements for both groups. The maximum anteroposterior displacements of condyles on both the affected and healthy sides during anteroposterior jaw･movement were significantly larger in the TMD group than the control group. There were no significant differences between groups in other measure- ments. These results suggest that condylar translation is inhibited on both sides during antero- posterior jaw movement {{in patients with}} unilateral TMD. They also suggest that although open-close jaw movement may not be useful, anteroposterior jaw movement may be useful in order to diagnose TMD...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of Campylobacter spp was examined {{in a variety}} of waters in Northern Ireland. Conventional cultural techniques were employed with 768 water specimens, including drinking waters (<b>tap,</b> spring, <b>bore</b> hole and bottled) and recreational waters (swimming pool, lough, river and sea). Positive waters included 1 / 11 (9. 1 %) drinking water from untreated well water, as well as 5 / 12 (41. 7 %) untreated surface waters from loughs and 7 / 8 (87. 5 %) untreated river waters. Overall, untreated surface waters may represent a source of contamination with Campylobacter spp. in Northern Ireland, where they have a recreational involvement or are used as a drinking source by man or agricultural livestock. Therefore waterborne campylobacteriosis should be considered in patients presenting with acute enteritis and a history of participation in water sports/activities. As faecal coliform organisms have been previously shown to be poor markers of water quality, especially for Campylobacter spp, new criteria should be established to assess the risk of this infection and to evaluate and monitor the quality of water used for recreational purposes...|$|R

30|$|We {{found that}} working memory {{capacity}} increased accuracy in {{answering questions about}} a scientific text, but that previous knowledge {{did not have an}} effect. This could suggest that answering questions immediately following the lesson in an e-learning environment like the one implemented here could be tapping immediate memory rather than elaboration of the content, and thus is another limitation of this study. Furthermore, in this remote testing situation participants could appeal to strategies, such as taking notes, making screenshots, or other means to increase accuracy. So then, a lesson followed by <b>closed</b> questions <b>tapping</b> literal and inferential information in e-learning could be measuring memory, or test-taking strategies. Therefore, teachers and instructional design in e-learning should consider this before implementing the common practice of including closed questions after a lesson as a comprehension check.|$|R
40|$|The airway {{response}} to deep inspirations (DIs) in asthmatics {{has been shown}} to be ineffective in producing bronchodilation and can even cause bronchoconstriction. However, the manner by which a DI is able to cause bronchoconstriction remains ambiguous. We sought to investigate the pathway involved in this stretch-activated contraction and whether this contraction is intrinsic to airway smooth muscle (ASM). In brief, intact bovine bronchial segments were dissected, and side branches were ligated and then mounted horizontally in an organ bath. Intraluminal pressure was measured under isovolumic condi-tions.

50|$|Rosenthal {{predicted}} that {{elementary school teachers}} may subconsciously behave in ways that facilitate and encourage the students' success. When finished, Rosenthal theorized that future studies could be implemented to find teachers who would encourage their students naturally without changing their teaching methods. The prior research that motivated this study was done in 1911 by psychologists regarding the case of Clever Hans, a horse that gained notoriety because {{it was supposed to}} be able to read, spell, and solve math problems by using its hoof to answer. Many skeptics suggested that questioners and observers were unintentionally signaling Clever Hans. For instance, whenever Clever Hans was asked a question the observers' demeanor usually elicited a certain behavior from the subject that in turn confirmed their expectations. For example, Clever Hans would be given a math problem to solve, and the audience would get very tense the <b>closer</b> he <b>tapped</b> his foot to the right number, thus giving Hans the clue he needed to tap the correct number of times.|$|R
5000|$|Before drilling, the {{underground}} geology {{needs to be}} understood, and drillers {{need to be prepared}} to seal the borehole, including preventing penetration of water between strata.
