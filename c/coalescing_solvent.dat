5000|$|The paint type {{known as}} Emulsion in the UK and Latex in the United States is a {{water-borne}} dispersion of sub-micrometer polymer particles. These terms {{in their respective}} countries cover all paints that use synthetic polymers such as acrylic, vinyl acrylic (PVA), styrene acrylic, etc. as binders. The term [...] "latex" [...] {{in the context of}} paint in the United States simply means an aqueous dispersion; latex rubber from the rubber tree is not an ingredient. These dispersions are prepared by emulsion polymerization. Such paints cure by a process called coalescence where first the water, and then the trace, or <b>coalescing,</b> <b>solvent,</b> evaporate and draw together and soften the binder particles and fuse them together into irreversibly bound networked structures, so that the paint cannot redissolve in the solvent/water that originally carried it. The residual surfactants in paint, as well as hydrolytic effects with some polymers cause the paint to remain susceptible to softening and, over time, degradation by water. The general term of latex paint is usually used in the United States, while the term emulsion paint is used for the same products in the UK and the term latex paint is not used at all.|$|E
40|$|Post-treatment and {{modification}} {{of a new}} process to form protective coatings on aluminum have been studied. This coating process S-Poly® is based on spontaneous polymerization on aluminum and other metals. The polymer coating studied here was formed from styrene, n-phenyl maleimide (NPMI), bismaleimide (BMI), and 2 -(methacryloyloxy) ethyl acetoacetate (MEA). Both optimization {{of the process and}} the characterization of changes in coating structure after polymerization were investigated. It was seen that the coating successfully changed into an adherent film through controlled rinsing and drying {{with the aid of a}} <b>coalescing</b> <b>solvent,</b> and drying at a high temperature (3 ̆e 170 °C) enhanced the performance of the coating in terms of corrosion resistance and adhesion. It was revealed that improvements could be attributed to removing surface water on the substrate and forming a dense protective layer by means of thermal crosslinking of β-diketone functional groups in the coating. The reaction mechanism associated with evolution of acetone, carbon dioxide, and acetoacetic acid was reported. The resultant coatings showed adhesion strength over 30 MPa in torsional test and corrosion free for 3000 hours exposure in salt fog spray test (ASTM B- 117). Furthermore, a new coating system incorporating N-isobutoxymethyl acrylamide (BAM) was developed. The new system became crosslinked at temperatures below 150 °C through the interaction between BAM and β-diketone groups. The resultant coating obtained desired performance without the damage to mechanical properties of some aluminum alloys, which is caused by high temperature drying. It is also reported that the use of a corrosion inhibitor Nitrolotris (methylene) triphosphonic acid (NTMP) resulted in superior corrosion resistance and adhesion, especially wet adhesion of the coating formed from this new system. ...|$|E
40|$|Reduction of {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) in coatings is being driven by regulation and consumer preference. Development of binders {{that are capable of}} delivering expected performance at low VOC is a major thrust of coatings research and development. Toward this end, polyurethane dispersions (PUDs) from natural oil polyester polyols (NOPs) have been developed. These hydrophobic NOP-based PUD coatings exhibit exceptional early water resistance and hydrolytic stability, excellent acid resistance, and good toughness & abrasion resistance. Most high performance PUDs require large amounts of solvent to form crack-free films with good properties. However, with the right choice of process and solvent parameters, PUDs have been shown to require reduced amounts of <b>coalescing</b> <b>solvents</b> to yield the desirable array of end-user properties with ambient temperature drying. High-throughput research (HTR) was used as a means to accelerate formulation and product development of PUDs. Rapid formulation and testing allows for probing of interactions between variables in greater depth and breadth than conventional formulation techniques, leading to rapid development of robust products and formulations. The HTR methods for coatings applications include the use of specially designed experiments, robotic formulation, coating, and characterization tools as well as informatics for data visualization, extraction, and modeling. This paper details the use of HTR capability to explore the effect of cosolvents on end-use properties of NOP based PUD coatings as well as the proposed mechanisms of film formation in NOP-PUDs. The results provide a basis for guidelines for selection of cosolvents for PUD coatings with high performance and low VOC (< 100 g/L VOC) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{nebulization}} reflux concentrator {{for removing}} trace gas contaminants from a sample gas is described. Sample gas from a gas supply is drawn by a suction source into a vessel. The gas enters the vessel through an atomizing nozzle, thereby atomizing and entraining a scrubbing liquid solvent drawn through a siphon tube from a scrubbing liquid reservoir. The gas and entrained liquid rise through a concentrator and impinge upon a solvent phobic filter, whereby purified gas exits through the filter housing and contaminated liquid <b>coalesces</b> on the <b>solvent</b> phobic filter and {{falls into the}} reservoir...|$|R
40|$|In {{the title}} {{compound}} (3 -amino- 4, 4 -diphenyl-BODIPY), C 28 H 32 BN 3, the central six-membered ring has a flattened sofa conformation, {{with one of}} the N atoms deviating by 0. 142  (4)  Å from the mean plane of the other five atoms, which have an r. m. s. deviation of 0. 015  Å. The dihedral angle between the two essentially planar outer five-membered rings is 8. 0  (2) °. In the crystal, molecules are linked via weak N—H [...] . π interactions, forming chains along [010]. The compound displays solvent-dependent behaviours in both NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy. In the 1 H NMR spectra, the aliphatic resonance signals virtually <b>coalesce</b> in <b>solvents</b> such as chloroform, dichloromethane and dibromoethane; however, they are fully resolved in solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), methanol and toluene. The excitation and fluorescence intensities in chloroform decreased significantly over time, while in DMSO the decrease is not so profound. In toluene, the excitation and fluorescent intensities are not time-dependent. This behaviour is presumably attributed to the assembly of 3 -amino- 4, 4 -diphenyl-BODIPY in solution that leads to the formation of noncovalent structures, while in polar or aromatic solvents, the formation of these assemblies is disrupted, leading to resolution of signals in the NMR spectra...|$|R
