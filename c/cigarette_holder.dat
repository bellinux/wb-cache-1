25|$|Japonesque was {{recorded}} in Japan and the United States, making it Koda's third studio album recorded in the latter country; Additional production and mastering was handled in the United States. Six different formats were released to promote the album; a standalone CD, a CD and DVD bundle, two separate digipak bundles, one a CD and double DVD bundle, and a digital release worldwide. Five different artworks were issued for the album's cover sleeve; the digipak and double DVD bundle has Koda posing in a kimono, the CD and DVD has Koda sitting in a seat, whilst the CD format has her holding a <b>cigarette</b> <b>holder.</b>|$|E
25|$|Female smokers in film {{were also}} early on {{associated}} with a type of sensuous and seductive sexuality, most notably personified by German film star Marlene Dietrich. Similarly, actors like Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn have been closely identified with their smoker persona, {{and some of their}} most famous portraits and roles have involved them being haloed by a mist of cigarette smoke. Hepburn often enhanced the glamor with a <b>cigarette</b> <b>holder,</b> most notably in the film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Smoking could also be used as a means to subvert censorship, as two cigarettes burning unattended in an ashtray were often used to suggest sexual activity.|$|E
25|$|All six cover sleeves for Japonesque were {{photographed by}} {{photographer}} and designer Kazuyoshi Shimomura. The standalone CD has {{a close-up of}} Koda looking down to the camera, holding a <b>cigarette</b> <b>holder.</b> The CD and DVD format has a long shot of Koda sitting at on a chair with different flowers sitting on the head piece. The three limited edition box set cover sleeves are similar images with different poses; the first box set has Koda {{standing in front of}} a wall with Japanese design; Koda is holding a traditional Oil-paper umbrella and is dressed in a pink kimono. The second box set artwork has Koda facing towards the camera, similar to the previous box set. The only change in the third box set artwork is that Koda is seen without holding the umbrella. The digital release uses the first limited edition box set artwork. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by Japanese designer Jun Hirota, and the design was based on traditional Japanese culture and the emphasizing of geisha art. The photo album that came with the second limited edition box set features a 28-page spread, featuring different images from the Japonesque photo shoot.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Beyoncé {{appeared}} on billboards and newspapers across Australia showing her holding an antiquated <b>cigarette</b> <b>holder.</b> Taken {{from the back}} cover of B'Day, the image provoked response from an anti-smoking group, stating {{that she did not}} need to add the <b>cigarette</b> <b>holder</b> [...] "to make herself appear more sophisticated". In the same year, three weeks after their release, the deluxe edition and the video anthology DVD were temporarily ceased for retail in stores. A lawsuit was filed for breach of contract of using [...] "Still in Love (Kissing You)", a cover version of British singer Des'ree's original song [...] "Kissing You". Not intended for the album's inclusion, Des'ree's deal also stipulated that the title of the song was not to be altered, and a video was not to be made. After the infringement case, the reissued edition of the album does not include the song, and instead includes [...] "If" [...] as a replacement.

In it, he stated that the connection to lung cancer was [...] "esoteric" [...] and referred to [...] "a barely determinable possible correlation between cigarette smoking and cancer." [...] He claimed that tobacco's calming effects led to more effective thinking.|$|E

500|$|... "Why", asked Coward, [...] "am I always {{expected}} {{to wear a}} dressing-gown, smoke cigarettes in a long holder and say 'Darling, how wonderful'?" [...] The answer lay in Coward's assiduous cultivation of a carefully crafted image. As a suburban boy who had been {{taken up by the}} upper classes he rapidly acquired the taste for high life: [...] "I am determined to travel through life first class." [...] He first wore a dressing gown onstage in The Vortex and used the fashion in several of his other famous plays, including Private Lives and Present Laughter. George Walden identifies him as a modern dandy. In connection with the National Theatre's 2008 exhibition, The Independent commented, [...] "His famous silk, polka-dot dressing gown and elegant <b>cigarette</b> <b>holder</b> both seem to belong to another era.

500|$|Alfred 'Freddie' Lennon—always called 'Alf' by his family—was always joking {{but never}} held {{a job for}} very long, preferring to visit Liverpool's many {{vaudeville}} theatres and cinemas, where he knew the usherettes by name.

500|$|During this period, he billed {{himself as}} Thomas (or Thos) Stevens, but reorganised {{the name to}} its {{backward}} spelling of Mot Snevets; the name {{did not last long}} and he changed it to Thomas Terry. He soon realised that people were mistaking him as a relative of Dame Ellen Terry, so inverted the name to Terry Thomas. He did not add the hyphen until 1947, and later explained that it was [...] "not for snob reasons but to tie the two names together. They didn't mean much apart; together they made a trade name": the hyphen was also [...] "to match the gap in his front teeth". By now, he was developing a unique sense of style both on and off stage. In order to avoid staining his fingers with smoke, he used a <b>cigarette</b> <b>holder</b> and later purchased [...] "the most irresistible holder in Dunhill's. It was slightly [...] because it was made of lacquered, black whangee... with a gold band twisting neatly round it". Adding to his look were a [...] "monocle, raffish waistcoat and red carnation". He later wrote that [...] "sartorially I was an eccentric. But I knew that underneath the clothes I was very much a conservative Englishman who {{would have loved to have}} been a genuine eccentric".|$|E

500|$|By 1930, MacArthur was still, at age 50, the {{youngest}} of the U.S. Army's major generals, and the best known. He left the Philippines on 19 September 1930 and for a brief time was in command of the IX Corps Area in San Francisco. On 21 November, he was sworn in as Chief of Staff of the United States Army, with the rank of general. While in Washington, he would ride home each day to have lunch with his mother. At his desk, he would wear a Japanese ceremonial kimono, cool himself with an oriental fan, and smoke cigarettes in a jeweled <b>cigarette</b> <b>holder.</b> In the evenings, he liked to read military history books. About this time, he began referring to himself as [...] "MacArthur". He had already hired a public relations staff to promote his image with the American public, together with a set of ideas he was known to favor, namely: a belief that America needed a strongman leader to deal with the possibility that Communists might lead all of the great masses of unemployed into a revolution; that America's destiny was in the Asia-Pacific region; and a strong hostility to the British Empire. One contemporary described MacArthur as the greatest actor to ever serve as a U.S Army general while another wrote that MacArthur had a court rather than a staff.|$|E
500|$|On 26 October 1949 Terry-Thomas {{wrote and}} starred in a new series on the BBC Television Service, How Do You View?, noted for being the first comedy series on British television. The {{programme}} was based around an on-screen persona of Terry-Thomas as [...] "a glamorous, mischievous and discreetly cash-strapped man-about-town", introducing a series of sketches in which he appeared alongside Peter Butterworth as his chauffeur; Janet Brown (Butterworth's real-life wife); Avril Angers; H.C. Walton as the family retainer, Moulting; and Diana Dors. The programme was broadcast live and often included Terry-Thomas walking through control rooms and corridors of the BBC's Lime Grove and Alexandra Palace studios. The author and historian Mark Lewisohn described the series as being [...] "inventive... truly televisual {{and not just a}} radio programme in costume". The series ran until 21 December 1949; a second series followed between April and May 1950, with Sid Colin taking over the scripting duties and Terry-Thomas providing additional material. By the third series, which was broadcast between November 1950 and February 1951, the audience reached four million viewers. In total there were five series of How Do You View?; the final episode was broadcast on 11 June 1952. Writing about Terry-Thomas on television, Wilfred Greatorex observed that [...] "he has... physical attributes that make him a gift to visual entertainment: a large, rather gaunt face, pre-fabricated for close-ups; the notorious space of one-third of an inch between his two most prominent top teeth; a mouth that is full of expression. Add to these pictoral [...] advantages his eight-inch <b>cigarette</b> <b>holder</b> and Eddie Cantor eyes".|$|E

This study is aimed to investigate the bioactivities of volatile constituents in BC and to explore the folklore behind the use of BC <b>cigarette</b> <b>holders</b> (BCCHs). We extracted the volatile constituents of BC by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) with carbon dioxide (CO 2 -SFE), then identified and analyzed the constituents by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).

These included triethyl phosphate, butylated hydroxytoluene, cedrol, n-hexadecanoic acid, squalene, and cholesterol. Meanwhile 13 inorganic elements (P, Ca, Mg, S, B, Si, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ba, etc.) were determined by inductively coupled plasma spectrometer (ICPS). In the bioactivity tests, the BC extract (BCE) showed a scavenging activity of 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl free radicals and hydroxyl radicals by phenanthroline-Fe (II) oxidation and moderate inhibition of Gram-positive microorganisms. The antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of BC, which are related to the active chemical composition, may explain the perceived benefit for cigarette smokers who use BCCHs...|$|R
