While most high-quality distance transforms compute {{the distance to}} the surface as well as the <b>closest</b> <b>point</b> on it, the contouring step typically uses only the distance and omits the <b>closest</b> <b>point</b> information. Our novel <b>closest</b> <b>point</b> contouring algorithm (CPC) uses the full <b>closest</b> <b>point</b> field, and, thus, allows improving existing methods for high-quality triangle mesh reconstruction based on implicit function models: Since we select the vertex positions directly from the set of <b>closest</b> <b>points,</b> all triangle vertices are guaranteed to lie exactly on the zero-contour and no approximations are necessary. By employing recent findings in the context of so-called embedding techniques, we derive a formulation of the mean curvature vector on the <b>closest</b> <b>point</b> representation and use this formulation to properly select the vertices to be triangulated. In combination with a new table-based triangulation scheme this allows us to detect and preserve sharp features, and to avoid small degenerated triangles in smooth areas. CPC can handle open and non-orientable surfaces, and its data-parallel nature makes it well suited for GPUs...|$|R
