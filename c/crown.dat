40|$|Purpose: Investigate {{and compare}} {{fracture}} resistance of four commercially available esthetic <b>crowns.</b> Methods: Sixty-four anterior <b>crowns</b> were used: NuSmile Primary <b>crowns</b> (NuSmile, Houston, Tex. USA) (16); Preveneered Cheng <b>Crowns,</b> (Orthodontic Technologies Inc., Houston, TX) (16); NuSmile ZR (NuSmile, Houston, Tex.

Force was applied at 90 ° with crosshead speed of 1  mm/min until they fractured. Maximum breaking loads were recorded. Data was then analyzed using software that measured the fracture {{resistance of the}} <b>crowns.</b> One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to find {{the differences between the}} groups and Scheffe post hoc test was used for intergroup comparisons. The level of significance was set as p ≤  0. 05. Results: Mean maximum loads were as follows: NuSmile ZR <b>crowns</b> (937. 36  +  131. 68  N), Cheng Zirconia <b>Crowns</b> (751. 43  +  102. 103  N), NuSmile Primary <b>crowns</b> (482. 37  +  76. 92), and Preveneered Cheng <b>Crowns</b> (415. 57  +  12. 28). Zirconia <b>crowns</b> the had highest fracture resistance compared to preveneered <b>crowns</b> (p <  0. 05). No significant difference between NuSmile ZR Zirconia and Cheng <b>Crowns</b> zirconia nor between NuSmile primary Preveenered and Preveneered Cheng <b>Crowns.</b> Conclusion: Zirconia <b>crowns</b> showed the highest fracture resistance with NuSmile zirconia <b>crowns</b> to being able to resist fracture even under intense pressure of load compared to Cheng <b>Crowns</b> zirconia...|$|R

40|$|Background or Statement of Problem: As, the {{longevity}} of provisional restorations is related to, a perfect adaptation and a strong, long-term union between restoration and teeth structures, therefore, evaluation of marginal leakage of provisional restorative materials luted with cements using the standardized procedures is essential. Aims and Objectives: To compare the marginal leakage of the provisional <b>crowns</b> fabricated from Autopolymerizing acrylic resin <b>crowns</b> and bisphenol A-glycidyl dimethacrylate (BIS-GMA) resin <b>crowns.</b> To compare the marginal leakage of the provisional <b>crowns</b> fabricated from autopolymerizing acrylic resin <b>crowns</b> and BIS-GMA resin <b>crowns</b> cemented with different temporary luting cements. To compare the marginal leakage of the provisional <b>crowns</b> fabricated from autopolymerizing acrylic resin (SC- 10) <b>crowns</b> cemented with different temporary luting cements. To compare the marginal leakage of the provisional <b>crowns</b> fabricated from BIS-GMA resin <b>crowns</b> (Protemp 4) cemented with different temporary luting cements. Methodology: Freshly extracted 60 maxillary premolars of approximately similar dimensions were mounted in dental plaster. Tooth reduction with shoulder margin was planned to use a customized handpiece-holding jig. Provisional <b>crowns</b> were prepared using the wax pattern fabricated from computer aided designing/computer aided manufacturing milling machine following the tooth preparation. Sixty provisional <b>crowns</b> were made, thirty each of SC- 10 and Protemp 4 and were then cemented with three different luting cements. Specimens were thermocycled, submerged in a 2 % methylene blue solution, then sectioned and observed under a stereomicroscope {{for the evaluation of}} marginal microleakage. A five-level scale was used to score dye penetration in the tooth/cement interface and {{the results of this study}} was analyzed using the Chi-square test, Mann–Whitney U-test, Kruskal–Wallis H-test and the results were statistically significant P < 0. 05 the power of study - 80 %. Results: Marginal leakage was significant in both provisional <b>crowns</b> cemented with three different luting cements along the axial walls of teeth (P < 0. 05) confidence interval - 95 %. Conclusion: The temporary cements with eugenol showed more microleakage than those without eugenol. SC- 10 <b>crowns</b> showed more microleakage compared to Protemp 4 <b>crowns.</b> SC- 10 <b>crowns</b> cemented with Kalzinol showed maximum microleakage and Protemp 4 <b>crowns</b> cemented with HY bond showed least microleakage...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of two gingival finishing lines (90 ° shoulder and deep chamfer) on the marginal fitness of two types of full anatomic all-ceramic crowns; zirconia <b>crowns</b> (Zikonzhan) and glass ceramic <b>crowns</b> (IPS e-max CAD) milled with CAD/CAM system. Materials and Methods: Two dentoform teeth of left maxillary first molar were prepared with chamfer finishing line (CFL) and shoulder finishing line (SFL), respectively and duplicated to Nickel-Chromium master dies. Thirty two <b>crowns</b> were fabricated and grouped as follows: Group I: 8 zirconia <b>crowns</b> on CFL; Group II: 8 zirconia <b>crowns</b> on SFL; Group III: 8 glass ceramic <b>crowns</b> on CFL and Group IV: 8 glass ceramic <b>crowns</b> on SFL. Marginal gaps were measured at 4 indentations, each one was at center of each tooth surface and collectively 16 points were measured by using stereomicroscope (160 X). The data were analyzed by One-way ANOVA and student t-tests. Results: Group I produced the least marginal gap (73. 55 µm); followed by Group II (92. 60 µm), and Group III (151. 45 µm) and the highest marginal gap was recorded by Group IV (162. 34 µm). Statistical analysis of the data showed that SFL produced significantly greater marginal gap on zirconia <b>crowns</b> in comparison with CFL. However, in glass ceramic <b>crowns,</b> CFL revealed less marginal gap compared to SFL but statistically was not significant. On the other hand, glass ceramic <b>crowns</b> significantly produced a greater marginal gap in comparison to zirconia <b>crowns</b> regardless type of finishing line. Conclusions: deep chamfer margin could be more preferable finishing line than 90 ° shoulder especially for zirconia full <b>crowns.</b> Furthermore, zirconia <b>crowns</b> could be more advisable than glass ceramic <b>crowns</b> in respect to marginal adaptation...|$|R
