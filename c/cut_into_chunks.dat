As an hors d'œuvre, the Cantonese wrap chunks of this egg with slices of pickled ginger root (sometimes sold on a stick as street food). A Shanghainese recipe mixes chopped century eggs with chilled tofu. In Taiwan, it is popular to eat century eggs by slicing them, and placed on top of cold tofu with katsuobushi, soy sauce, and sesame oil in a style similar to Japanese hiyayakko. A {{variation}} of this recipe common in northern China is to slice century eggs over chilled silken (soft) tofu, adding liberal quantities of shredded young ginger and chopped spring onions as a topping, and then drizzling light soy sauce and sesame oil over the dish, to taste. They are also used in a dish called old-and-fresh eggs, where chopped century eggs are combined with (or used to top) an omelet made with fresh eggs. The century eggs may also be <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>chunks</b> and stir fried with vegetables, which is most commonly found in Taiwanese cuisine.|$|E

50|$|Lamb meat is <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>chunks</b> {{and placed}} into a stew pot over heat. Chicken {{may be used}} as an {{alternative}} to lamb. Tomatoes, along with cinnamon, bay leaves, ginger, garlic, red chili powder, cumin seeds, fried onions, black cardamom, garam masala and cooking oil are added and stirred. Potatoes and salt are mixed in. Water is added, in a proportion that is enough to cover the meat, and brought to the boil. The aloo gosht is covered and left to simmer until the meat becomes tender. Once ready, it may be garnished with chopped coriander and served hot.|$|E
50|$|The fish is {{typically}} caught by local fishermen, <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> small <b>chunks</b> and cooked {{in boiling water}} with red potatoes. Some boilers add onions as well. Salt is the only seasoning used, and used only to raise the specific gravity of the water. Up to one pound of salt per two gallons of water is used.|$|R
50|$|Sate buntel (lit: wrapped satay): Minced fatty beef or goat meat, {{encased in}} caul fat and {{wrapped around a}} bamboo skewer then grilled.

Actually {{everyone}} has a secret spices to make their kelewele taste extraordinary, however commercial preparations exist that can simplify preparation and offer a standardized taste. The oil should be hot and the plantain not be too soft, or it will absorb too much oil. It is cooked until the sugar in the plantains caramelizes, with brown edges..|$|E
50|$|Lountza is {{made from}} the pork tenderloin. After the initial brining and marinading in wine, it is smoked. Although it can be aged, many prefer younger, milder lountza. It is often cooked over coals or fried with eggs {{to act as a}} {{sandwich}} filler or as part of a meze. Stronger than lountza and made from the leg, is chiromeri, which is similar to any smoked, air-dried ham from Southern Europe, although the wine flavour makes it characteristically Cypriot. In non-mountain areas, the same meat used for chiromeri is cut into strips along the muscle compartments and dried in the sun as basta. The shoulder of a freshly slaughtered animal is <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>chunks</b> about the size of an almond along with a smaller quantity of chopped back fat, which are marinated in wine and brined, stuffed into intestines, and smoked as sausages (loukaniko).|$|E

25|$|Researchers use {{a mixture}} of highly {{purified}} enzymes (Collagenase) to isolate islets from the pancreas of a deceased donor. Collagenase solution is injected into the pancreatic duct which runs through the head, body and tail of the pancreas. Delivered this way, the enzyme solution causes distension of the pancreas, which is subsequently <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> small <b>chunks</b> and transferred <b>into</b> so-called Ricordi's chamber, where digestion takes place until the islets are liberated and removed from the solution. Isolated islets are then separated from the exocrine tissue and debris in a process called purification.|$|R
50|$|Goulash can be {{prepared}} from beef, veal, pork, or lamb. Typical cuts include the shank, shin, or shoulder; as a result, goulash derives its thickness from tough, well-exercised muscles rich in collagen, which is converted to gelatin during the cooking process. Meat is <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>chunks,</b> seasoned with salt, and then browned with sliced onion in a pot with oil or lard. Paprika is added, along with water or stock, and the goulash is left to simmer. After cooking a while, garlic, whole or ground caraway seed, or soup vegetables like carrot, parsley root, peppers (green or bell pepper) and celery may be added. Other herbs and spices could also be added, especially chili pepper, bay leaf and thyme. Diced potatoes may be added, since they provide starch as they cook, which makes the goulash thicker and smoother. However, chili peppers and potatoes are modern additions, totally unknown in the original recipe. A small amount of white wine or wine vinegar may also be added {{near the end of}} cooking to round the taste. Goulash may be served with small egg noodles called csipetke. The name Csipetke comes from pinching small, fingernail-sized bits out of the dough (csipet =pinch) before adding them to the boiling soup.|$|E
40|$|Restriction enzyme. A {{restriction}} enzyme {{is a small}} molecule composed of nucleotides, which {{has the ability to}} cut (restrict) a large DNA molecule at the place where it binds. An enzyme called HindII cuts DNA molecules at all occurrences of nucleotide sequences GTGCAC and GTTAAC. An occurrence of the nucleotide sequences GTGCAC or GTTAAC in a DNA molecule is called a restriction site. Complete Restriction Digest. A biological procedure in which DNA is amplified and then <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>chunks</b> using a {{restriction enzyme}}. In this procedure, each DNA molecule is cut at each restriction site.

40|$|This {{present study}} {{examines}} the preservation quality of dressed chicken procured from different sources of processing during storage at – 18 ± 1 ºC. Breast {{portion of the}} dressed birds obtained from three different sources, viz. market/road side slaughtered chicken (MSC), retail slaughtered chicken (RSC), and scientifically slaughtered chicken (SSC), were <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>chunks,</b> divided into 250 g portions, packed in polyethylene bags, stored at – 18 ± 1 ºC and evaluated at 30 days intervals for changes in quality attributes. Frozen storage had no marked influence on pH change of the samples. SSC samples had higher extract release volume (15. 34 ± 0. 08 to 13. 45 ± 0. 93 ml) than MSC (13. 00 ± 0. 19 to 9. 91 ± 0. 97 ml) and RSC samples (13. 65 ± 0. 24 to 11. 70 ± 1. 21 ml). There was significant increase (P< 0. 05) in thiobarbituric acid of all three sample types during storage but values were well below the threshold level of spoilage. SSC samples showed lower tyrosine content throughout frozen storage compared to MSC and RSC samples. A significant decline in microbial load, viz. total viable count, coliform count, psychrophilic count and yeast and moulds count were noticed during frozen storage. Organoleptic attributes, viz. appearance, flavour, texture and overall palatability were not affected due to frozen storage except juiciness in MSC samples which decreased (P< 0. 05) from 6. 53 ± 0. 13 to 5. 96 ± 0. 11 on 90 days of storage.

500|$|Pilot {{whale meat}} is {{available}} for consumption in very few areas of Japan, mainly along the central Pacific coast, and also {{in other areas of}} the world, such as the Faroe Islands. The meat is high in protein (higher than beef) and low in fat. [...] Because a whale's fat is contained in the layer of blubber beneath the skin, and the muscle is high in myoglobin, the meat is a dark shade of red. In Japan, where pilot whale meat can be found in certain restaurants and izakayas, the meat is sometimes served raw, as sashimi, but just as often pilot whale steaks are marinated, <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> small <b>chunks,</b> and grilled.

5000|$|A {{point of}} great {{interest}} for this lemma is its application to the derivation of highly parallel implementations of computations. Indeed, it is trivial to see that [...] has a highly parallel implementation, and so does [...] — most obviously as a binary tree. Thus for any list homomorphism h, there exists a parallel implementation. That implementation <b>cuts</b> the list <b>into</b> <b>chunks,</b> which are assigned to different computers; each computes the result on its own chunk. It is those results that transit on the network and are finally combined into one. In any application where the list is enormous {{and the result is}} a very simple type - say an integer - the benefits of parallelisation are considerable. This is the basis of the map-reduce approach.|$|R

40|$|AbstractOur {{objective}} {{was to examine the}} effects of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) on physico-chemical properties and bacteriological quality of caiman (Caiman crocodilus yacare) meat. Caiman tail meat was <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> 25  g <b>chunks,</b> individually vacuum packaged, and allocated to four treatments: non-treated (NT; not subjected to HHP), and samples subjected to HHP at 200  MPa (P 2), 300  MPa (P 3), and 400  MPa (P 4). Physico-chemical properties, fatty acid profile, and bacteriological quality were evaluated. All HHP treatments (P 2, P 3, and P 4) demonstrated lower (P <  0. 05) microbial loads than NT. HHP decreased (P <  0. 05) n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid content and hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic ratio. However, HHP increased (P <  0. 05) n- 6 /n- 3 ratio as well as indices of atherogenicity and thrombogenicity, which are critical indicators for the risk of cardiac diseases. The results suggest that while HHP improves bacteriological safety, it can compromise the fatty acid profile and nutritive value of caiman meat, which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids...|$|R
5000|$|The Southern New Mexican {{version is}} usually pork <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> strips and <b>chunks.</b> Historically, before refrigeration, the pork was {{fermented}} in red chile in a crock {{using the same}} bacterial cultures as in yogurt (but it is not dairy). Fermented meat {{was a way of}} preservation and imparted a [...] "sour" [...] taste to the pork which explains why modern New Mexican adovada recipes call for a bit of white vinegar or lemon/lime juice. The red chile is prepared [...] "con pellejo" [...] with bits of the chile skin using spices of fresh minced garlic, mortar and pestle ground oregano, comino (cumin), cilantro, and coriander seeds {{that may or may not}} be toasted. The dish is then baked until the meat is tender, moist and succulent on the inside while encrusted with a semi-dry and crisp red chile exterior that is almost blackened. Other versions of red chile and boiled or braised pork may be claimed as carne adovada. Other versions of red chilli and pork sin pellejo are actually what is known as Chile Colorado. Carne adovada may be served with a tortilla, beans and rice, fideos or homefries, or papas with a fresh vinegar slaw or salad.|$|R
