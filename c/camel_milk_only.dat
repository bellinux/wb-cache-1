40|$|According to {{different}} authors, <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> has many virtues, true or supposed, and is suggested as adjuvant treatment for different disorders like infectious diseases, diabetes, cancer, autism etc…Generally, these assertions {{are based on}} empirical observations or, in the best case, on very few clinical trials achieved more or less according to the correct scientific standard (sufficient number of patients, double-blind trials), or more recently on in-vitro experiments. The beneficial effect of <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> on human health is generally attributed to some molecules (vitamin C, “insulin-like”, bio-active proteins,…) which were identified in <b>camel</b> <b>milk.</b> <b>Camel</b> lactoferrin (CamLf) {{is one of these}} molecules having a high affinity to iron, and by this way,it plays a role in iron uptake by the intestinal mucosa of the suckling neonate and thus be the source of iron for breast-fed infants. The Lf antibacterial, antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities are useful for therapeutic applications. Recent publication mentioned also high inhibitory effect of Camel Lf on hepatitis C. A comparative study showed that camel Lf has the highest antimicrobial activity compared to other mammals. Moreover, since one study achieved in the year 2000, it is said that in <b>camel</b> <b>milk,</b> Lf is present in high amounts (10 times more than in cow milk) and show heat-resistant properties.

30|$|This study {{provides}} evidence that hygiene and quality practices {{are unlikely to}} meet the safety and quality requirements for urban consumers. Subjective assessment of safety and quality based on colour and taste still predominate. These are inadequate for addressing hygiene issues previously observed in <b>camel</b> <b>milking</b> and milk handling. Several authors (Farah et al. 2004 b; Matofari et al. 20072013) have identified poor hygiene of the commercialised <b>milk.</b> Most <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> traders buy <b>only</b> fresh <b>milk</b> from producers since most <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> consumers prefer fresh unfermented milk. In particular, a major segment of the consumers, comprising the Somali community, believe unprocessed <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> has medicinal properties which would otherwise be lost through heating. However, Akweya et al. (2010 b) observed that <b>camels</b> are usually <b>milked</b> in poor sanitary conditions, with all the predisposing factors to diseases such as mastitis that include dust, flies and scarce water resources. In particular, lack of clean water for milking, {{lack of understanding of}} the principles of clean <b>milk</b> production by <b>camel</b> keepers and lack of overnight milk cooling facilities present challenges. Other studies (Akweya et al. 2010 b; Meile 2010; Wanjohi et al. 2010) have also demonstrated the presence of common milk pathogens, mostly Staphylococcus aureus, in <b>camel</b> <b>milk.</b> Farah et al.

30|$|Milk {{production}} in Kenya {{is dominated by}} cattle and camels which contribute 86 and 10 % of total milk production respectively (GOK 2010). Kenya has a camel population of over 3.3 million (KNBS 2010), and are particularly important in North Eastern {{region of the country}} where a large community of Somali and related ethnicities are more familiar with <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> (FAO 2011). Along the <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> value chain, <b>only</b> 5 % of the milk is processed while the rest is consumed at household level and hotels in the milk-producing areas and urban centres such as Isiolo, Nairobi and Nakuru (Musinga et al. 2008). The bulk of the milk stays at ambient temperature {{for a long time before}} reaching either the cooling centre or the market (GOK 2010). The milk is commonly handled in plastic containers which are not just difficult to clean but also the poor quality of water used to clean them enhances microbial levels in milk (Mwangi et al. 2000). The milk handlers also pool the milk from different sources without carrying out quality tests (Younan and Abdulrahman 2004). These factors result in increased microbial counts along the chain as reported by Matofari et al. (2013) with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms such as Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus spp. reported (Matofari et al. 2013; Odongo et al. 2016; Kashongwe et al. 2017). The main problem, however, faced by the traders along this chain is milk spoilage (Wayua et al. 2012). The occurrence of these factors, and their contribution to increase in microbial counts in milk along the chain have not been reported. Empirical studies of these factors are therefore important in prioritizing interventions to not <b>only</b> reduce <b>milk</b> spoilage along the chain but also reduce health risks to which <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> consumers may be exposed.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. <b>Camel's</b> <b>milk</b> {{proteins}} {{have very}} little homology with cow's Milk proteins, and, in addition, beta-lactoglobulin, the major allergenic protein in cow's milk, is completely absent in <b>camel's</b> <b>milk.</b> Such structural differences may result in different antigenic responses induced by these two milks. In the present work we studied the immunoreactivity of <b>camel's</b> <b>milk</b> proteins using sera from children with confirmed allergy to cow's milk proteins. Methods. We used milk caseins and whey proteins from Targui camels from Southern Algeria and sera from 10 patients allergic to cow's milk proteins confirmed by their clinical history and by skin tests. The immunoreactivity of <b>camel's</b> and cow's <b>milk</b> proteins was studied by indirect Elisa using these sera. Results. All the 10 sera showed reactivity with cow's <b>milk</b> caseins whereas <b>only</b> 4 of them reacted with <b>camel's</b> <b>milk</b> caseins, and these responses were significantly lower (16 to 92 %) compared to the responses to cow's milk proteins. In contrast, all of the whey proteins reacted with the patients' sera, but these responses were lower than those with bovine whey proteins (36 to 85 % lower).

These findings suggest that <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> could {{play an important role in}} decreasing oxidative stress by alteration of antioxidant enzymes and nonenzymatic antioxidant molecules levels, as well as the improvement of autistic behaviour as demonstrated by the improved Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Camel</b> <b>milk</b> plays {{a central}} role in the food supply of Eastern African and Middle Eastern {{countries}} (e. g. Kenya, Somalia, Saudi, and Ethiopia), home to the majority of the world’s camel population. Raw, and traditionally fermented <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> has become increasingly commercialised and consumed in urban areas. This has led to an increased interest in the processing of <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> for the urban market, with skimmed <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> casein and whey powders soon to be commercialised, in a manner similar to the already widely available bovine dairy powders. However, little information is currently available concerning the effects of different processing methods (e. g. thermal treatment) on <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> fractions. Currently there are no <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> derived products, such as yoghurt or cheese, available in local Saudi supermarkets. Furthermore, the abundance of bioactive substances in <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> have been reported to have useful effects; one of the most prominent is the anti-diabetic benefits revealed by in vivo studies. However, the presence of insulin in <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> still remains to be proven. The aims of this thesis are twofold. The first area (Chapters 2, 3 and 4) describe the effect of heat treatment on <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> components and their functional properties in an oil and water emulsion, and in yoghurt. In order to test these functional properties, <b>camel</b> skimmed <b>milk,</b> whey and casein were prepared and freeze dried. The key novel findings include: skimmed milk that had been heat treated and freeze dried showed significantly improved functionality for use in emulsions and yoghurts, whereas heat treated whey did showed no significantly enhanced functional properties. Furthermore, non-heated freeze dried casein significantly enhanced curd formation in yoghurt, and resulted in a smooth texture. Two fermented yoghurts were developed containing heat treated skimmed milk powder or casein with similar textural properties to bovine milk commercial yoghurt, that were acceptable in taste and texture, as determined by an independent study for sensory evaluation. The second area of this study (Chapter 5) concerned the characterisation of insulin in <b>camel</b> <b>milk.</b> As it was confirmed by previous studies that the presence of high concentration of insulin in <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> comparing to bovine milk. Key findings were that no protein with a characteristic molecular weight similar to bovine or human insulin (5. 8 KDa) could be detected using Western Blotting; however, a 62 KDa protein showed consistent immune reactivity. ELISA results showed high immune reactivity in camel whey. An in vivo assay showed biological insulin like activity in <b>camel</b> <b>milk,</b> but the validity of the assay still needs to be confirmed...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Nephrotoxicity {{is a major}} {{complication}} and a dose {{limiting factor}} for cisplatin therapy. Cisplatin mediated nephrotoxicity is remarkably documented by reactive oxygen species. <b>Camel's</b> <b>milk</b> has good nutritive value, antigenotoxic and anticytotoxic effects. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the protective effect of <b>camel's</b> <b>milk</b> against Cisplatin-induced renal oxidative stress in mice. Approach: Forty mal Swiss albino mice were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10). Group I, control group. Group II was received cisplatin (12 mg kg - 1) for 5 alternate days. Group III was received <b>camel's</b> <b>milk</b> (33 mL kg - 1) for consecutive 30 days. Group IV was received <b>camel's</b> <b>milk</b> (33 mL kg - 1) for consecutive 30 days before administration of Cisplatin. Results: Cisplatin-induced oxidative stress was indicated by increased level of tissue Malondialdehyde (MDA), serum creatinine and urea, decreased the concentration of reduced Glutathione (GSH), Vitamin C (Vit. C) and Vitamin E (Vit. E) and decreased both activities and gene expression of Superoxid Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione Raductase (GR) and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx). <b>Camel's</b> <b>milk</b> reduced these biochemical changes and counteracted the deleterious effects of cisplatin Conclusion: The present study demonstrated the renoprotective potential of <b>camel's</b> <b>milk</b> against cisplatin-induced oxidative stress and renal dysfunction in mice. Hence, <b>camel's</b> <b>milk</b> has a potential to be used as therapeutic adjuvant in cisplatin nephrotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} oral administration of <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> on liver enzymes, total proteins and histology of poloxamer 407 induced hyperlipidaemic wistar rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty male wistar rats weighing between 150 - 200 g were randomly assigned into six groups of five each; group I: administered distilled water, group II: induced with P 407, group III: induced with P 407 and treated with atorvastatin (20 mg/kg) and groups IV, V and VI: induced with P 407 and treated with <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg respectively. After three weeks, blood samples and liver tissues were collected for the determination of alkaline phospatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin/globulin ratio and histological studies respectively. RESULTS: All <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> treated groups showed significant (p < 0. 05) decrease in ALT and AST. <b>Camel</b> <b>milk</b> treated groups; 250 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg showed significant (p < 0. 05) decrease in total protein, globulin with all <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> treated groups having significant (p < 0. 05) increase in A/G ratio. Histological examination of liver tissues showed that <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> at a dose of 250 mg/kg had slight adipocytes infiltration. CONCLUSION: The results of our findings highlight the hepatoprotective effect of <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> in poloxamer 407 induced hyperlipidaemic wistar rats...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} amino acids {{content and the}} electrophoretic profile of <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> casein from different <b>camel</b> breeds. <b>Milk</b> from three different camel breeds (Majaheim, Wadah and Safrah) as well as cow milk were used in this study. Results showed that ash and moisture contents were significantly higher in <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> casein of all breeds {{compared to that of}} cow milk. On the other hand, casein protein of cow milk was significantly higher compared to that of all <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> breeds. Molecular weights of casein patterns of <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> breeds were higher compared to that of cow milk. Essential (Phe, Lys and His) and non-essential amino acids content was significantly higher in cow milk casein compared to the casein of all <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> breeds. However, {{there was no significant difference}} for the other essential amino acids between cow casein and the casein of Safrah breed and their quantities in cow and Safrah casein were significantly higher compared to the other two breeds. Non-essential amino acids except Arg and the essential amino acids (Met, Ile, Lue and Phe) were also significantly higher in cow milk α-casein compared to α-casein from all camel breeds. Moreover, essential amino acids (Val, Phe and His) and the non-essential amino acids (Gly and Ser) content was significantly higher in cow milk β-casein compared to the β-casein of all <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> breeds and the opposite was true for Lys, Thr, Met and Ile. However, Met, Ile, Phe and His were significantly higher for β-casein of Majaheim compared to the other two milk breeds. The non-essential amino acids (Gly, Tyr, Ala and Asp) and the essential amino acids (Thr, Val and Ile) were significantly higher in cow milk κ-casein compared to that for all <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> breeds. There was no significant difference among all <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> breeds in their κ-casein content of most essential amino acids. Relative migration of casein bands of <b>camel</b> <b>milk</b> casein was not identical. The relative migration of αs-, β- and κ-casein of camel casein was slower than those of cow casein. The molecular weights of αs-, β- and κ-casein of camel caseins were 27. 6, 23. 8 and 22. 4 KDa, respectively. More studies are needed to elucidate the structure of <b>camel</b> <b>milk...</b>|$|R
