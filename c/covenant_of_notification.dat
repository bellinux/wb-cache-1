50|$|According to Covenant {{theology}} God {{makes two}} basic covenants, or agreements, with humans. The first one, the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Works is {{an agreement that}} bases man's relationship with God on human obedience and morality. The covenant was made with Adam in the Garden of Eden. Adam broke this covenant so God {{replaced it with a}} second more durable covenantâ€”the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace. The <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace is an agreement that bases man's relationship with God on God's grace and generosity. The <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Works failed because it was based on human performance. The <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace is durable because it is based on God's performance.|$|R

5|$|Covenant {{theology}} is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly {{developed during the}} seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God's dealings with men are {{described in terms of}} two covenants: the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works and <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace. The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works (sometimes called the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace. This <b>covenant</b> allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God's law perfectly. The idea <b>of</b> the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people.|$|R
50|$|Concepts {{foundational}} {{to covenant}} theology {{can be found}} in the writings of Church Fathers such as Irenaeus and Augustine. Huldrych Zwingli and Johannes Oecolampadius were among the first reformers to speak of God's salvation economy under the categories <b>of</b> a <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works and a <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace. John Calvin (Institutes 2:9-11), like Heinrich Bullinger (A Brief Exposition of the One and Eternal Testament or <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> God), focused on the continuity <b>of</b> the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace, but taught the substance of what became classic covenant theology in terms of Law and Gospel. Early post-reformation writings, including Zacharius Ursinus (1534-83) in Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism (published posthumously, 1591), Caspar Olevianus (1536-87) in Concerning the Substance <b>of</b> the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace between God and the Elect (De substantia foederis gratuiti inter deum et electos, 1585), and Scottish Theologian Robert Rollock (1555-99) in A Treatise of our Effectual Calling (Tractatus de vocatione efficaci, 1597), developed the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works and <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace scheme along the lines of the law-gospel distinction.|$|R

5000|$|Covenant theology, a {{theological}} system within Reformed Christianity, holds that God relates to man primarily through three covenants: the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Redemption, the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Works, and the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace.

2500|$|Through the {{influence}} of Karl Barth, many contemporary Reformed theologians have discarded the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works, along with other concepts of federal theology. Barth saw the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works as disconnected from Christ and the gospel, and rejected the idea that God works with people in this way. Instead, Barth argued that God always interacts with people under the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace, and that the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace is free of all conditions whatsoever. Barth's theology and that which follows him has been called [...] "monocovenantal" [...] {{as opposed to the}} [...] "bi-covenantal" [...] scheme of classical federal theology. Conservative contemporary Reformed theologians, such as John Murray, have also rejected the idea <b>of</b> <b>covenants</b> based on law rather than grace. Michael Horton, however, has defended the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works as combining principles of law and love.|$|R

50|$|Overview: Under the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Works humanity, {{represented}} ultimately in a covenantal sense under Adam beginning {{from the}} Garden of Eden, failed {{to live as}} God intended and stood condemned. But beyond time the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Redemption was made between the Father and Son, to agree that Christ would live an acceptable substitutionary life on behalf of, and as a covenantal representative for, those who would sin but would trust in Christ as their covenantal substitutionary representative, which bought them into the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace. The <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace applies to all who trust Christ for their salvation, regardless of ethnicity, and thus the Covenant covers Jews and Gentiles alike with regard to salvation, sanctification, and resurrection. The <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace forms the basis <b>of</b> the later <b>covenants</b> with Noah, Abraham, Moses, David and the New Covenant in Christ.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace {{promises}} {{eternal life}} for all people who have faith in Christ. He also promises the Holy Spirit to the elect to give them willingness and ability to believe. Christ is the substitutionary covenantal representative fulfilling the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works on their behalf, in both the positive requirements of righteousness and its negative penal consequences (commonly described as his active and passive obedience). It is the historical expression <b>of</b> the eternal <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> redemption. Genesis 3:15, {{with the promise of}} a [...] "seed" [...] of the woman who would crush the serpent's head, is usually identified as the historical inauguration for the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace.|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} in ten homes was {{conducted}} to understand what influences usersâ€™ acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home environment. The key finding is that perceived message urgency is the primary indicator <b>of</b> acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the homeâ€”if people think a message is urgent, they want the message to be shown immediately, regardless {{of what they are}} doing at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> The study also shows that the acceptability of low-urgent and medium-urgent messages could be improved by taking into account mental activity load at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> No effect <b>of</b> physical activity was found on acceptability. The results suggest that to improve the scheduling <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home, notification systems need a mechanism assessing both the message urgency and the mental activity load, whereas physical activity can be ignored. From a methodological point of view, it is difficult to measure acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in a realistic setting, given the need to balance experimental control with realistic context.

5000|$|Having created man in His {{image as}} a free {{creature}} with knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, God entered into a <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works whereby the mandate was [...] "do this and live" [...] (Romans 10:5, Galatians 3:12). [...] "Like Adam, they have trespassed the covenant" [...] (Hosea 6:7) is the classic reference to the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works; Hebrews 8:6; 9:15; 12:24 the reference that explains God's work of redemption in the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace.|$|R
50|$|All the {{covenants}} that God makes {{with humans}} after the Fall, (e.g. with Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David) all extend the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace to its logical conclusion in Jesus Christ.

50|$|Though {{it is not}} {{explicitly}} called a covenant in the opening chapters of Genesis, the comparison of the representative headship of Christ and Adam, as well as passages like Hosea 6:7 have been interpreted to support the idea. It has also been noted that Jeremiah 33:20-26 (cf. 31:35-36) compares the covenant with David to God's covenant with {{the day and the}} night and the statutes of heaven and earth which God laid down at creation. This has led some to understand all of creation as covenantal: the decree establishing the natural laws governing heaven and earth. The <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works might then be seen as the moral law component of the broader creational covenant. Thus the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works has also been called the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> creation, indicating that it is not added but constitutive of the human race; the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> nature in recognition of its consonance with the natural law in the human heart; and the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> life in regard to the promised reward.|$|R
