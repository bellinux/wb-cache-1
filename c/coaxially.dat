25|$|Two common motifs {{involving}} coaxial stacking are kissing {{loops and}} pseudoknots. In kissing loop interactions, the single-stranded loop regions of two hairpins interact through base pairing, forming a composite, <b>coaxially</b> stacked helix. Notably, this structure allows {{all of the}} nucleotides in each loop to participate in base-pairing and stacking interactions. This motif was visualized and studied using NMR analysis by Lee and Crothers. The pseudoknot motif occurs when a single stranded region of a hairpin loop basepairs with an upstream or downstream sequence within the same RNA strand. The two resulting duplex regions often stack upon one another, forming a stable <b>coaxially</b> stacked composite helix. One example of a pseudoknot motif is the highly stable Hepatitis Delta virus ribozyme, in which the backbone shows an overall double pseudoknot topology.|$|E
25|$|A 30mm 2A72 autocannon {{is mounted}} <b>coaxially</b> with the 2A70 rifled gun. The turret of the BMD-4 {{contains}} {{a total of}} 500 rounds ready {{to be used by}} its autocannon with 245 of them being high explosive and the remaining being armor-piercing discarding sabot. This autocannon fires projectiles with a muzzle velocity of 1120m/s and a cyclic rate of fire of 350–400 rds/min. The rounds fired can penetrate 22mm of Rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) from a range of 2000 m while impacting at an angle of 60°. Minimum gas contamination of the turret is achieved by a delayed unlocking due to single-barrel long recoil action and forward case ejection. The 7.62mm PKT machine gun is mounted <b>coaxially</b> with 100mm and 30mm weapons. 2000 rounds are carried in the turret for the PKT machine gun; all combined into one tape to eliminate reloading.|$|E
25|$|In 1819 an {{improved}} siren {{was developed and}} named by Baron Charles Cagniard de la Tour. De la Tour's siren consisted of two perforated disks that were mounted <b>coaxially</b> at the outlet of a pneumatic tube. One disk was stationary, while the other disk rotated. The rotating disk periodically interrupted the flow of air through the fixed disk, producing a tone. De la Tour's siren could produce sound under water, suggesting a link with the sirens of Greek mythology; hence {{the name of the}} instrument.|$|E
25|$|SU-122-54 (Ob'yekt 600) (Samokhodnaya Ustanovka) - Self-propelled 122mm gun, {{based on}} the T-54A and {{sometimes}} known as IT-122. Between 1955 and 1957, 77 vehicles were built with minor differences between production lots (different commander's cupola etc.). The SU-122-54 had a modified chassis, with small spaces between the first, second and fourth pair of wheels and a large gap between the third, similar to the T-62's and a superstructure, built into the hull, housing the 122mm D-49 L/48.4 gun for which the vehicle carries 35 rounds. The secondary armament consisted of two KPVT heavy machine guns, one mounted as an anti-aircraft machine gun near the commander's hatch and the other mounted <b>coaxially</b> with the main gun. The vehicle carried 600 rounds for the machine guns. The main gun has a fume extractor positioned right behind the muzzle brake, some vehicles {{did not have the}} fume extractor. Other variations included a different commander's cupola.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{armament}} of the BMD-3 is the 30mm 2A42 autocannon in {{the form}} of the original BMP-2 turret. This autocannon is mounted on other vehicles, like the Ka-52 and Mi-28. The 2A42 autocannon is a dual selective feed cannon which is fitted with a distinct muzzle brake and manual weapons laying drives increasing accuracy and consistency. This muzzle brake reduces oscillation of the gun mount at the moment of a round being fired. The practical rate of fire is 200-300 rds/min (rounds per minute) while the cyclic rate of fire is over 550 rds/min. It fires rounds with a muzzle velocity of 960m/s. The BMD-3 has 500 rounds for the 30mm autocannon ready to be used with an additional 360 stowed inside. The maximum effective range when firing AP-T (armor-piercing-tracer) ammunition is 2000 m, and when firing HE-I (high-explosive-incendiary) ammunition is 4000 m against an area target. A 7.62×54mmR PKT machine gun is mounted <b>coaxially</b> on the right side of the main armament. This coaxial machine gun has a cyclic rate of fire of 800 rds/min and is also equipped with one belt of 2000 rounds. The KBP Instrument Design Bureau offers a drop-in one-man turret, called the Kliver turret, with a stabilized 2A72 30mm gun, four Kornet ATGM launchers, thermal sights, a coaxial 7.62mm PKT machine gun, and an improved fire control system.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{armament}} {{consists of}} 85mm Type 62-85TC rifled main gun with fume extractor {{almost at the}} end of the barrel. It is the same gun as the one used in the Type 63 amphibious light tank and can fire AP, APHE, HE, Frag-HE, HEAT, APFSDF-T and smoke rounds. The gun has maximum range of 12,200 m and maximum aimed range of 1,870 m and has a rate of fire of 3 to 5 round per minute. The Type 62 light tank is characterized by having poor accuracy, given the primitive optical gun sights that the gunner has to use and lack of a gun stabilizer (which differs it from Chinese main battle tanks), a fire control system and night vision equipment. As a secondary armament the Type 62 light tank was given the 12.7mm Type 54 anti-aircraft heavy machine gun (Chinese copy of Soviet 12.7mm DShK 1938/46 heavy machine gun) mounted on a rotatable mount on top of the loader's hatch on the right hand side of the roof of the turret and two 7.62mm Type 59T medium machine guns, one mounted <b>coaxially</b> with the main gun and the other one mounted at the bow of the tank. Also a 7.62mm Type 59T anti-aircraft medium machine gun can be additionally fitted to left hand side turret hatch. The cast turret features the Soviet-style half-egg shape. The tank carriers 47 rounds for the 85mm Type 62-85TC rifled main gun, 2,000 rounds for the two Type 59T medium machine guns and 1,250 rounds for 12.7mm Type 54 anti-aircraft heavy machine gun.|$|E
500|$|Besides {{the machine}} gun mounted <b>coaxially</b> to the main gun, there were three [...]30 cal. machine guns in the hull. One was mounted in a ball mount {{in front of the}} bow gunner. The other two were mounted in fixed sponson mounts. The machine guns were fired by the driver; they were aimed by {{pointing}} the entire tank at the desired target. Another [...]30 cal machine gun was normally mounted {{on the top of the}} turret for anti-aircraft defense.|$|E
500|$|The MTLS-1G14 {{project was}} {{started at the}} same time as the CTMS-1TB1 to produce a four-man medium tank for the Dutch Army. It was armed with two 1.5in (37mm) {{automatic}} cannons. It also was equipped with five M1919 machine guns, three of which were mounted on the hull, one mounted <b>coaxially,</b> and one mounted on the top of the turret. The armor was bolted and measured between [...] The design was soon taken over by the Ordnance Department and was tested at Aberdeen in April 1943. It was rejected by the U.S Army because there were better medium tanks already in production.|$|E
500|$|The M15 {{was based}} on the M3 Halftrack chassis, adding a <b>coaxially</b> mounted {{armament}} of a fully automatic M1 [...] gun and two superior placed [...]50 cal (12.7mm) M2 Browning machine guns.

Against armored targets, firing the Panzergranate (armor-piercing shell) at [...] the KwK37 could penetrate , inclined at 30 degrees, at ranges of up to [...] A [...] MG 34 machine gun was mounted <b>coaxially</b> with the main weapon in the turret, while a second machine gun of the same type was mounted in the front plate of the hull. The main weapon and coaxial machine gun were sighted with a Turmzielfernrohr 5b optic while the hull machine gun was sighted with a Kugelzielfernrohr 2 optic. The Ausf.A was protected by [...] of steel armor on the front plate of the chassis, and [...] on the turret. This was only capable of stopping artillery fragments, small-arms fire, and light anti-tank projectiles.|$|E
2500|$|Most well-studied RNA {{tertiary}} structures contain {{examples of}} coaxial stacking. Some prominent examples are tRNA-Phe, group I introns, group II introns, and ribosomal RNAs. Crystal structures of tRNA revealed {{the presence of}} two extended helices that result from coaxial stacking of the amino-acid acceptor stem with the T-arm, and stacking of the D- and anticodon-arms. These interactions within tRNA orient the anticodon stem perpendicularly to the amino-acid stem, leading to the functional L-shaped tertiary structure. In group I introns, the P4 and P6 helices were shown to <b>coaxially</b> stack {{using a combination of}} biochemical and crystallographic methods. [...] The P456 crystal structure provided a detailed view of how coaxial stacking stabilizes the packing of RNA helices into tertiary structures. In the self-splicing group II intron from Oceanobacillus iheyensis, the IA and IB stems <b>coaxially</b> stack and contribute to the relative orientation of the constituent helices of a five-way junction. This orientation facilitates proper folding of the active site of the functional ribozyme. [...] The ribosome contains numerous examples of coaxial stacking, including stacked segments as long as 70 bp.|$|E
2500|$|Magnetic {{coupling}} devices transmit torque through magnetically transparent barriers (that is, the barrier is non-magnetic or is magnetic {{but is not}} affected by an applied magnetic field), for instance between sealed containers or pressurised vessels. The optimal torque couplings consists {{of a pair of}} <b>coaxially</b> nested cylinders with opposite +k and [...] -k flux magnetization patterns, as this configuration is the only system for infinitely long cylinders that produce a torque. In the lowest energy state, the outer flux of the inner cylinder exactly matches the internal flux of the outer cylinder. Rotating one cylinder relative to the other from this state results in a restoring torque.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{versions}} of the T1 series of light tanks shared the same basic layout, with the engine mounted {{in the front and}} the turret, transmission and final drive all located in the rear. The exceptions were the T1E4 and T1E6, which moved the turret to the middle, the engine to the rear, and the transmission and final drive to the front, a configuration similar to later tanks. All T1 versions had a manually traversed turret armed with a 37 mm (...) main gun and a <b>coaxially</b> mounted [...]30 caliber (7.62mm) M1919 Browning machine gun, and all carried a crew of two: a commander who sat within the turret and worked the guns, and a driver seated {{just in front of the}} turret.|$|E
2500|$|The BMP-3 {{is one of}} {{the most}} heavily armed {{infantry}} combat vehicles in service, fitted with a low-velocity 2A70 100mm rifled gun, which can fire conventional shells or 9M117 ATGMs (AT-10 Stabber). 40 100mm-rounds and 8 ATGMs are carried. A 2A72 30mm dual feed autocannon with 500 (300 HEI and 200 APT) rounds and a rate of fire of 350 to 400 RPM, and a 7.62mm PKT machine gun with 2,000 rounds, all mounted <b>coaxially</b> in the turret. The main gun elevates from −5° to +60°. There are also two 7.62mm PKT bow machine guns, again with 2,000 rounds each. The BMP-3 is capable of engaging targets out to 5,000–6,000 meters with its ATGM weapon system 9K116-3 [...] "Basnya". With conventional ammunition, such as the HE-Frag shell 3OF32, the 2A70 gun has a range of 4,000 meters.|$|E
2500|$|The Sentinel was {{designed}} to mount either a QF 2 pounder or a QF 6 pdr (57mm, 2.25 in). However as the production order for 6 pounder tank guns had not been acted on, none of these were available and the first 65 tanks were built with the 2 pounder. Two Vickers machine guns were carried as secondary armament, one in the hull and a second mounted <b>coaxially</b> beside the main gun. [...] The preferred engines suitable to power a 28 tonne tank, a Pratt & Whitney Wasp single row petrol radial, or a Guiberson diesel radial, were not available within Australia, so the Sentinel was powered by the combined output of three Cadillac 346 in³ (5.7 L) V8 petrol car engines installed in clover-leaf configuration (two engines side-by-side {{to the front and}} a single to the rear: all three feeding a common gearbox). Sixty-five production vehicles had been completed by June 1943.|$|E
2500|$|Fossils {{from the}} early Cambrian bear a {{striking}} resemblance to the velvet worms. These fossils, known collectively as the lobopodians, were marine and represent a grade from which arthropods, tardigrades, and Onychophora arose. They are found in the Cambrian, Ordovician (possibly), Silurian and Pennsylvanian periods. Historically, all fossil Onychophora and lobopods were lumped into the taxon Xenusia, further subdivided by some authors to the Paleozoic Udeonychophora and the Mesozoic/Tertiary Ontonychophora; living Onychophora were termed Euonychophora. Importantly, few of the Cambrian fossils bear features that distinctively unite them with the Onychophora; none can be confidently assigned to the onychophoran crown or even stem group. The exceptions are Hallucigenia and related taxa such as Collinsium ciliosum, which bear distinctly onychophoran-like claws. It is not clear when the transition to a terrestrial existence was made, but it is considered plausible that it took place between the Ordovician and late Silurian—approximately —via the intertidal zone. The low preservation potential of the non-mineralised Onychophora means that they have a sparse fossil record. Stem-group members include Helenodora (Carboniferous), Tertiapatus dominicanus, and Succinipatopsis balticus (Tertiary); crown group representatives are known only from amber—there is a single, partial specimen from the Cretaceous, and a more comprehensive record in Eocene deposits from [...] But, in fact, some of these amber-borne specimens lack slime papillae and separate feet, thus may belong in the stem group. The vagaries of the preservation process can make fossils difficult to interpret. Experiments on the decay and compaction of onychophora demonstrate difficulties in interpreting fossils; certain parts of living onychophora are only visible in certain conditions. The mouth {{may or may not be}} preserved; claws may be re-oriented or lost; leg width may increase or decrease; and mud may be mistaken for organs. More significantly, features seen in fossils may be artefacts of the preservation process: for instance, [...] "shoulder pads" [...] may simply be the second row of legs compressed <b>coaxially</b> onto the body; branching [...] "antennae" [...] may in fact be produced through decay.|$|E
