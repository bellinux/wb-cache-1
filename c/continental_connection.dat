500|$|Even {{before his}} {{problems}} with the Canadian government, Shackleton had been considering a southern expedition as a possible alternative to the Beaufort Sea. According to the RGS librarian Hugh Robert Mill, as early as March 1920 Shackleton had talked about two possible schemes—the Beaufort Sea exploration, and [...] "an oceanographical expedition with the object of visiting all the little-known islands of the South Atlantic and South Pacific". By June 1921, the latter plan had expanded to include a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent and the mapping of around 2,000miles (3,200km) of uncharted coastline. It would also encompass a search for [...] "lost" [...] or wrongly charted sub-Antarctic islands (including Dougherty Island, Tuanaki, and the Nimrod Islands), and would investigate possible mineral resources to be exploited in these rediscovered lands. A scientific research program would include a visit to Gough Island, and an investigation of a possible [...] "underwater <b>continental</b> <b>connection</b> between Africa and America." [...] Shackleton's biographer Margery Fisher calls the plan [...] "diffuse", and [...] "far too comprehensive for one small body of men to tackle within two years", while according to Roland Huntford, the expedition had no obvious goal and was [...] "only too clearly a piece of improvisation, a pretext [...] to get away".|$|E

50|$|The {{consequences}} of these changes were seen in the 18th century. Poetry was still the dominant literary medium and its practitioners were poor scholars, often educated in the classics at local schools and schoolmasters by trade. Such writers produced polished work in popular metres for a local audience. This was particularly the case in Munster, in the south-west of Ireland, and notable names included Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin and Aogán Ó Rathaille of Sliabh Luachra. A certain number of local patrons were still to be found, even in the early 19th century, and especially among the few surviving families of the Gaelic aristocracy.

40|$|SUMMARY: Eight palaeogeographic-palinspastic {{sketches}} are pr ented for intervals from Late Oligocene to Pliocene {{times for}} the circum-Mediterranean area and the Paratethys. They are based primarily on accurate correlation of marine arid continental biogeographic events a d take into account thegenerally accepted ideas of plate tectonics. The marine and <b>continental</b> <b>connections</b> that can be inferred contribute important information on the geological evolution of the Eastern Mediterranean. During Cenozoic time the Tethyan realm was separated into areas of contrasting sedimenta-tion. Between the Eurasian and African plates the Mediterranean and the Paratethys sea was strongly influenced by changing connections with the Atlantic and Indo [...] Pacific Oceans. In Neogene time the Eastern Mediterranean and its adjacent regions became both the most important marine gateway to the Indo-Pacific and the most significant land-bridge for mam-mal migrations between Africa and Eurasia. Recognition of this has inspired numerous attempts at improving existing palinspastic re-constructions (e. g. Biju-Duval etal. 1976; Boc-caletti 1979; Dewey et al. 1973). The approach presented here involves palinspastic reconstruc-tions for Late Oligocene to Pliocene times, {{and is based on}} the following: (1) A more accurate correlation of both marine and continental biostratigraphies with the stage systems in use in these regions.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of fresh-water fishes {{like that of}} other groups, has been widely utilized by zoogeographers, but with widely divergent acumen and success. At one extreme are those non-ichthyologists who have uncritically utilized for evidence certain groups whose distribution happens to support whatever theory they may be espousing. At the other extreme {{is the work of}} careful ichthyologists like DE BEAUFORT (1913) and REGAN (1922) whose thorough knowledge of the groups with which they are working demands the most careful consideration of their conclusions. However, no zoogeographer who utilizes the evidence of diverse groups can be familiar at first hand with all of them, and the difficulty facing such workers is that of seeking out the really dependable evidence in those groups he does not know well. Aside from the difficulty of selecting dependable authorities or systematic works, the zoogeographer desiring to use the evidence of fresh-water fishes has another troublesome matter to contend with. This is the differing tolerance of salt-water exhibited by different groups of fresh-water fishes. As one example, and one which has frequently troubled zoogeographers, we may mention the Galaxiidae, fresh-water fishes of Southern South America, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, whose distribution has been held by some to be evidence for continental drift or southern intercontinental land-bridges. Ichthyologists now know that these fishes are, as a group, salt-tolerant and possibly either anadromous or catadromous, and that they are not really strong evidence for <b>continental</b> <b>connections</b> simply because it seems possible that they may cross ocean barriers...|$|R

40|$|Mark Broughton, ???A Story of the London Fog? Adulterated Modernisms in The Lodger???s Inter-titles???, paper {{presented}} at <b>Continental</b> <b>Connections,</b> Leicester, UK, 10 - 11 July, 2007. That Ivor Montagu was invited by Michael Balcon to refine The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (Hitchcock, UK, 1926) is well known. The film???s avant-garde tendencies can, in part, be attributed to Montagu???s involvement. Little emphasis has been placed, however, on the striking inter-title designs which Montagu commissioned from E. McKnight Kauffer. Indeed, there is a paucity of research on inter-titles in general. Among the most elaborate inter-title designs of the surviving silent films, Kauffer???s semi-abstract works fuse several European avant-gardes. This stylistic promiscuity evokes the narrative???s theme of split-personalities {{and the sense of}} ambiguity which pervades the film. At the same time, typography and simple animation is used to combine classical causality with expressionism. This paper explores the contribution of the designs to The Lodger as a whole, and seeks to contextualise them in terms of Kauffer???s other work. Kauffer (an American) designed posters which, for many, constituted the epitome of popular modern design in 1920 s Britain. Kauffer???s posters drew on cubism: in The Lodger???s inter-titles, cubism is deployed to fuse expressionism with constructivism, two European modernisms which were absent from Kauffer???s other work. British audiences were thus exposed to adulterated forms of these continental avant-gardes through The Lodger???s inter-titles, long before the styles were widely known in Britain in their own right. The paper will analyse the specific ways in which expressionism and constructivism are employed in Kauffer???s inter-titles, tracing these influences back to Kauffer???s membership of the Film Society and his association with Ivor Montagu...|$|R
