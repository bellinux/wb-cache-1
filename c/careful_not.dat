5|$|Earlier, Pope Urban VIII had {{personally}} asked Galileo to give arguments {{for and against}} heliocentrism in the book, and to be <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to advocate heliocentrism. He made another request, that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter of those requests was fulfilled by Galileo.|$|E

5|$|Kurt Franz {{maintained}} {{a photo album}} against orders never to take photographs inside Treblinka. He named it Schöne Zeiten ("Good Times"). His album is a rare source of images illustrating the mechanised grave digging, brickworks in Małkinia and the Treblinka zoo, among others. Franz was <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to photograph the gas chambers.|$|E
5|$|Some early {{travellers}} found dodo meat unsavoury, {{and preferred}} to eat parrots and pigeons; others {{described it as}} tough but good. Some hunted dodos only for their gizzards, as this was considered the most delicious part of the bird. Dodos were easy to catch, but hunters had to be <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to be bitten by their powerful beaks.|$|E
5|$|Sukarno {{continued}} to command loyalty from {{large sections of}} the armed forces as well as the general population, and Suharto was <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to be seen to be seizing power in his own coup. For eighteen months following the quashing of the 30 September Movement, there was a complicated process of political manoeuvres against Sukarno, including student agitation, stacking of parliament, media propaganda and military threats.|$|E

5|$|After Eleanor's marriage, {{many of her}} Savoyard {{relatives}} {{joined her}} in England. At least 170 Savoyards arrived in England after 1236, coming from Savoy, Burgundy and Flanders, including Eleanor's uncles: Boniface became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and William became Henry's chief adviser for a short period. Henry arranged marriages {{for many of them}} into the English nobility, a practice that initially caused friction with the English barons, who resisted landed estates passing into the hands of foreigners. The Savoyards were <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to exacerbate the situation and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society, forming an important power base for Eleanor in England.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with PBS in 2006, (after sixteen years of experience with Grameen Bank as a social business) Yunus expressed satisfaction in the micro-credit system of Grameen bank as a motivation and {{an opportunity for the}} poor to improve their own situations. He stressed that he has observed that Grameen's borrowers attain a sense of confidence and self-sufficiency when they pay back their loans from Grameen bank. While being <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to criticise charity's rightful place, he added that the recipient of a charitable gift does not experience these long-term emotional benefits in the same way.|$|E

5|$|The {{unresolved}} larger narrative arc encourages {{speculation about}} future story events. According to Martin, {{much of the}} key to Ice and Fire future lies over a dozen years in the fictional past, of which each volume reveals more. Events planned from the beginning are foreshadowed, although Martin is <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to make the story predictable. The viewpoint characters, who serve as unreliable narrators, may clarify or provide different perspectives on past events. Therefore, what the readers believe to be true {{may not necessarily be}} true.|$|E
5|$|Although Riley was wealthy {{from his}} books, {{he was able}} to triple his annual income by touring. He found the lure hard to resist and decided to return to the lecture circuit in 1892. He hired William C. Glass to assist Henry Eitel in {{managing}} his affairs. While Eitel handled the finances, Glass worked to organize his lecture tours. Glass worked closely with Riley's publishers to have his tours coincide with the release of new books, and ensured his tours were geographically varied enough to maintain his popularity in all regions of the nation. He was <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to book busy schedules; Riley only performed four times a week and the tours were short, lasting only three months.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Poland was {{undergoing}} yet more upheaval: in 1978, John Paul II was elected Pope, providing a national figurehead of world importance; in 1980, the influential movement Solidarność was created, led by Lech Wałęsa; and in 1981, martial law was declared by General Wojciech Jaruzelski. From 1981–89, Lutosławski refused all professional engagements in Poland {{as a gesture}} of solidarity with the artists' boycott. He refused to enter the Culture Ministry to meet any of the ministers, and was <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> be photographed in their company. In 1983, {{as a gesture of}} support, he sent a recording of the first performance (in Chicago) of the Third Symphony to Gdańsk to be played to strikers in a local church. In 1983, he was awarded the Solidarity prize, of which Lutosławski was reported to be more proud than any other of his honours.|$|E

5|$|From 1930 to 1934, Wu {{studied at}} the National Central University (later renamed Nanjing University and {{reinstated}} in Taiwan), first in mathematics, but later transferring to physics. She became involved in student politics. Relations between China and Japan were tense at this time, and students were urging the government to take a stronger line with Japan. Wu was elected {{as one of the}} student leaders by her colleagues because they felt that since {{she was one of the}} top students at the university, her involvement would be forgiven, or at least overlooked, by the authorities. That being the case, she was <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to neglect her studies. She led protests that included a sit-in at the Presidential Palace in Nanjing, where the students were met by Chiang Kai-shek.|$|E
5|$|In summer 969, Sviatoslav {{returned}} to Bulgaria in force, accompanied by allied Pecheneg and Magyar contingents. In his absence, Pereyaslavets had been recovered by Boris II; the Bulgarian defenders {{put up a}} determined fight, but Sviatoslav stormed the city. Thereafter Boris and Roman capitulated, and the Rus' rapidly established control over eastern and northern Bulgaria, placing garrisons in Dorostolon and the Bulgarian capital of Preslav. There Boris continued to reside and exercise nominal authority as Sviatoslav's vassal. In reality he {{was little more than}} a figurehead, retained in order to lessen Bulgarian resentment at and reaction to the Rus' presence. Sviatoslav appears to have been successful in enlisting Bulgarian support. Bulgarian soldiers joined his army in considerable numbers, tempted partly by the prospects of booty, but also enticed by Sviatoslav's anti-Byzantine designs and probably mollified by a shared Slavic heritage. The Rus' ruler himself was <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to alienate his new subjects: he forbade his army from looting the countryside or plundering cities that surrendered peacefully.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{both the}} mill owners and local unions were against the army's {{takeover}} of lumber production. The mill owners disliked having the army overseeing their businesses, and the unions saw soldiers' labor {{as a form}} of strikebreaking. Disque, however, called on everyone to support war production. He was also <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to favor either owners or unions as he increased production, helping both sides achieve their goals. For the mill owners, military manpower kept mills open and running at full capacity; in addition, it prevented radicals from sabotaging facilities or equipment. The unions benefited because military rules stabilized wages and improved working conditions for loggers and sawmill workers throughout the Pacific Northwest. Among the improved conditions was a standard eight-hour day.|$|E

25|$|In Imperial Japan, {{the left-wing}} of the Japanese Esperanto {{movement}} was forbidden, but its leaders were <b>careful</b> enough <b>not</b> {{to give the}} impression to the government that the Esperantists were socialist revolutionaries, which proved a successful strategy.|$|R
5|$|Odaenathus was {{succeeded by}} his son; the ten-year-old Vaballathus. Zenobia, {{the mother of}} the new king, was the de facto ruler and Vaballathus {{remained}} in her shadow while she consolidated her power. Gallienus dispatched his prefect Heraclian to command military operations against the Persians, but he was marginalized by Zenobia and returned to the West. The queen was <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to provoke Rome, claiming for herself and her son the titles held by her husband while guaranteeing the safety of the borders with Persia and pacifying the Tanukhids in Hauran. To protect the borders with Persia, Zenobia fortified different settlements on the Euphrates including the citadels of Halabiye and Zalabiye. Circumstantial evidence exist for confrontations with the Sasanians; probably in 269 Vaballathus took the title Persicus Maximus ("The great victor in Persia") and the title might be linked with an unrecorded battle against a Persian army trying to regain control of Northern Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|In the March 2005 {{issue of}} Science, Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University and colleagues {{announced}} {{the recovery of}} soft tissue from the marrow cavity of a fossilized leg bone from a Tyrannosaurus rex. The bone had been intentionally, though reluctantly, broken for shipping and then not preserved in the normal manner, specifically because Schweitzer was hoping to test it for soft tissue. Designated as the Museum of the Rockies specimen 1125, or MOR 1125, the dinosaur was previously excavated from the Hell Creek Formation. Flexible, bifurcating blood vessels and fibrous but elastic bone matrix tissue were recognized. In addition, microstructures resembling blood cells were found inside the matrix and vessels. The structures bear resemblance to ostrich blood cells and vessels. Whether an unknown process, distinct from normal fossilization, preserved the material, or the material is original, the researchers do not know, and they are <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to make any claims about preservation. If it {{is found to be}} original material, any surviving proteins may be used as a means of indirectly guessing some of the DNA content of the dinosaurs involved, because each protein is typically created by a specific gene. The absence of previous finds {{may be the result of}} people assuming preserved tissue was impossible, therefore not looking. Since the first, two more tyrannosaurs and a hadrosaur have also been found to have such tissue-like structures. Research on some of the tissues involved has suggested that birds are closer relatives to tyrannosaurs than other modern animals.|$|E

It {{is not that}} they make promises with the intention of breaking them, but they don't know what breaking them is. A boy who is <b>not</b> <b>careful</b> does <b>not</b> know the difference between being careful and being careless; and so he breaks his promise, and then, if he gets into any trouble by his folly, he says, 'I did not think there was any harm in that.' ...|$|R
