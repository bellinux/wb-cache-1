This refinement enables its associated <b>cortical</b> <b>circuit</b> to generate a specific resonant ("carrier") frequency by which the circuit can separate its signaling from that of other circuits.A more recent article by LaBerge & Kasevich (2013) describes signaling by neurons as the neural correlate of objective information processing and resonating in clusters of apical dendrites as the neural correlate of subjective impressions (e.g., impressions of sounds, colors, and feelings). These two [...] "articles provide theoretical support for the hypothesis that apical dendrite resonance supplements neural signaling as a major mode of neural function. Furthermore, the resonance-based subjective impressions may be regarded as the contents of consciousness.|$|E

Using a conditional ErbB 4 deletion, we tested the role of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) -expressing interneurons in the postnatal maturation of cortical circuits in vivo. ErbB 4 removal from VIP interneurons during development leads to changes in their activity, along with severe dysregulation of cortical temporal organization and state dependence.

40|$|Value-based action {{selection}} {{has been}} suggested to be realized in the corticostriatal local circuits through competition among neural populations. In this article, we review theoretical and experimental studies that have constructed and verified this notion, and provide new perspectives on how the local-circuit selection mechanisms implement reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and computations beyond them. The striatal neurons are mostly inhibitory, and lateral inhibition among them has been classically proposed to realize “Winner-Take-All (WTA) ” selection of the maximum-valued action (i. e., ‘max’ operation). Although this view has been challenged by the revealed weakness, sparseness, and asymmetry of lateral inhibition, which suggest more complex dynamics, WTA-like competition could still occur on short time scales. Unlike the striatal circuit, the <b>cortical</b> <b>circuit</b> contains recurrent excitation, which may enable retention or temporal integration of information and probabilistic “soft-max” selection. The striatal “max” circuit and the cortical “soft-max” circuit might co-implement an RL algorithm called Q-learning; the <b>cortical</b> <b>circuit</b> might also similarly serve for other algorithms such as SARSA. In these implementations, the <b>cortical</b> <b>circuit</b> presumably sustains activity representing the executed action, which negatively impacts dopamine neurons {{so that they can}} calculate reward-prediction-error. Regarding the suggested more complex dynamics of striatal, as well as cortical, circuits on long time scales, which could be viewed as a sequence of short WTA fragments, computational roles remain open: such a sequence might represent (1) sequential state-action-state transitions, constituting replay or simulation of the internal model, (2) a single state/action by the whole trajectory, or (3) probabilistic sampling of state/action...|$|E

This challenges the universality of the basic canonical <b>cortical</b> <b>circuit.</b> Here, we show that by including an overlooked realistic small nonspecific background neural activity, the same basic model can reproduce intermittent rivalry and rivalry memory without compromising static rivalry and other cortical phenomena. The background activity induces a mutual-inhibition mechanism for short-term memory, which is robust to noise and where fine-tuning of recurrent excitation or inclusion of sub-threshold currents or synaptic facilitation is unnecessary.

This kind of cortical organization, termed canonical circuit, has been functionally demonstrated primarily by studies involving visual striate cortex, and then, the concept has been extended to different cortical areas. In brief, the canonical circuit is composed of superficial pyramidal neurons of layers II/III receiving different inputs and deep pyramidal neurons of layer V that are responsible for cortex output. Superficial and deep pyramidal neurons are reciprocally connected, and inhibitory interneurons participate in modulating the activity of the circuit. The main intuition of this model is that the entire cortical network could be modeled as the repetition of relatively simple modules composed of relatively few types of excitatory and inhibitory, highly interconnected neurons. We will review the origin and the application of the canonical <b>cortical</b> <b>circuit</b> model in the six sections of this paper. The first section (The origins of the concept of canonical circuit: the cat visual cortex) reviews the experiments performed in the cat visual cortex, from the origin of the concept of canonical circuit to the most recent developments in the modelization of cortex. The second (The canonical circuit in neocortex) and third (Toward a canonical circuit in agranular cortex) sections try to extend the concept of canonical circuit to other cortical areas, providing some significant examples of circuit functioning in different cytoarchitectonic contexts. The fourth section (Extending the concept of canonical circuit to economic decisions circuits) reviews the experiments conducted in humans by using transcranial magnetic stimulation to demonstrate the validity of the canonical <b>cortical</b> <b>circuit</b> model. The fifth section (Extending the concept of canonical circuit to economic decisions circuits) explores the hypothesis that also complex human behaviors such as economic decision-making could also be explained in terms of canonical <b>cortical</b> <b>circuit.</b> The final section (Conclusion) provides a critical point of view, evidencing the limits of the available data and tracking directions for future research.

40|$|Categorical {{encoding}} {{is crucial}} for mastering large bodies of related sensory experiences. Recent single-unit recording studies in the macaque prefrontal cortex have demonstrated two characteristic forms of neural encoding of the sequential structure of the animal's behaviour. One population of neurons encodes the specific behavioural sequences. A second population of neurons encodes the sequence category (e. g. ABAB, AABB or AAAA) and does not differentiate sequences within the category [1]. Interestingly these neurons are intermingled in the lateral prefrontal cortex, and not topographically segregated. Here we report on a neural network simulation study that reproduces and explains these results. We simulate a <b>cortical</b> <b>circuit</b> as three 5 x 5 layers (infra-granular, granular, and supra-granular) of leaky integrator neurons with a sigmoidal output function, and we examine 103 such circuits running in parallel.

Here, we identify the neurophysiological basis of both {{the rate of change}} and anticipation computations on synaptic inputs in a <b>cortical</b> <b>circuit.</b> Through biophysically realistic computer simulations and neuronal recordings, we show that the rate-of-change computation is operated robustly in cortical networks through the combination of two ubiquitous brain mechanisms: short-term synaptic depression and spike-frequency adaptation. We then show how this rate-of-change circuit can be embedded in a convergently connected network to anticipate temporally incoming synaptic inputs, in quantitative agreement with experimental findings on anticipatory responses to moving stimuli in the primary visual cortex. Given the robustness of the mechanism and the widespread nature of the physiological machinery involved, we suggest that rate-of-change computation and temporal anticipation are principal, hard-wired functions of neural information processing in the cortical microcircuit.

40|$|During <b>cortical</b> <b>circuit</b> {{development}} in the mammalian brain, groups of excitatory neurons that receive similar sensory information form microcircuits. However, cellular mechanisms underlying cortical microcircuit development remain poorly understood. Here we implemented combined two-photon imaging and photolysis in vivo to monitor and manipulate neuronal activities to study the processes underlying activity-dependent circuit changes. We found that repeated triggering of spike trains in a randomly chosen group of layer 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex triggered long-term plasticity of circuits (LTPc), resulting in the increased probability that the selected neurons would fire when action potentials of individual neurons in the group were evoked. Significant firing pattern changes were observed more frequently in the selected group of neurons than in neighboring control neurons, and the induction was dependent on the time interval between spikes, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, and Calcium/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation. In addition, LTPc was associated with an increase of activity from a portion of neighboring neurons with different probabilities.

The shift in receptors underlying transmission is mediated by a strong activity-dependent downregulation of NMDARs and modest increase in AMPARs.
