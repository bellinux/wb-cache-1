50|$|In 1826 in Scotland, the {{inventor}} Reverend Patrick Bell designed (but did not patent) a reaper machine, which used the scissors principle of plant cutting - a principle {{that is still}} used today. The Bell machine was pushed by horses. A few Bell machines were available in the United States. In 1835, in the United States, Hiram Moore built and patented the first combine harvester, which was capable of reaping, threshing and winnowing cereal grain. Early versions were pulled by horse, mule or ox teams. In 1835, Moore built a full-scale version with a length of 5.2 m (17 ft), <b>cut</b> <b>width</b> of 4.57 m (15 ft) and by 1839, over 50 acre of crops were harvested. This combine harvester was pulled by 20 horses fully handled by farmhands. By 1860, combine harvesters with a cutting, or swathe, width of several metres were used on American farms. Australian Hugh Victor McKay produced a commercially successful combine harvester in 1885, the Sunshine Harvester.|$|E
5000|$|The Japanese saw or nokogiri (...) {{is a type}} of saw used in {{woodworking}} and Japanese carpentry {{that cuts}} on the pull stroke, unlike most European saws that cut on the push stroke. Japanese saws are the best known pull saws, but they are also used in Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Nepal. Among European saws, both coping saws for woodworking and jewelers saws for metal working also cut on the pull stroke like Japanese saws. Cutting on the pull stroke is claimed to cut more efficiently and leave a narrower <b>cut</b> <b>width</b> (...) [...] On the other hand, a pull stroke does not easily permit putting ones body weight behind a stroke. This can be readily solved by using a vise or clamping. Another disadvantage, due to the arrangement and form of the teeth , is that Japanese saws do not work as well on hardwoods as European saws do. Japanese saws were originally intended for comparatively soft woods like cypress and pine whereas European saws were intended for hard woods like oak and maple.|$|E

40|$|Toolmark {{analysis}} involves examining marks {{created on}} an object {{to identify the}} likely tool responsible for creating those marks (e. g., a knife). Although a potentially powerful forensic tool, knife mark analysis {{is still in its}} infancy and the validation of imaging techniques as well as quantitative approaches is ongoing. This study builds on previous work by simulating real-world stabbings experimentally and statistically exploring quantitative toolmark properties, such as cut mark angle captured by micro-CT imaging, to predict the knife responsible. In Experiment 1 a mechanical stab rig and two knives were used to create 14 knife cut marks on dry pig ribs. The toolmarks were laser and micro-CT scanned to allow for quantitative measurements of numerous toolmark properties. The findings from Experiment 1 demonstrated that both knives produced statistically different <b>cut</b> mark <b>widths,</b> wall angle and shapes. Experiment 2 examined knife marks created on fleshed pig torsos with conditions designed to better simulate real-world stabbings. Eight knives were used to generate 64 incision cut marks that were also micro-CT scanned. Statistical exploration of these cut marks suggested that knife type, serrated or plain, can be predicted from <b>cut</b> mark <b>width</b> and wall angle. Preliminary results suggest that knives type can be predicted from <b>cut</b> mark <b>width,</b> and that knife edge thickness correlates with <b>cut</b> mark <b>width.</b> An additional 16 cut marks walls were imaged for striation marks using scanning electron microscopy with results suggesting that this approach might not be useful for knife mark analysis. Results also indicated that observer judgements of cut mark shape were more consistent when rated from micro-CT images than light microscopy images. The potential to combine micro-CT data, medical grade CT data and photographs to develop highly realistic virtual models for visualisation and 3 D printing is also demonstrated. This is the first study to statistically explore simulated real-world knife marks imaged by micro-CT to demonstrate the potential of quantitative approaches in knife mark analysis. Findings and methods presented in this study are relevant to both forensic toolmark researchers as well as practitioners.

The main constraints entailed in real cutting, such as chatter free, uncut free tool paths, cutter and machine tool limitations, are included into the optimal model. The optimal parameters (depth of <b>cut,</b> <b>width</b> of cut, spindle speed) are {{inserted into the}} tool paths generation directly for four kinds of conventional cutting modes (Zig and Zig-Zag parallel cutting mode, inwards and outwards spiral pattern modes). According {{to the fact that}} the first cut in every cut level is slotting milling, the milling areas are divided into slotting milling area and general milling area. This dynamically corrected tool paths generation method changes the order of conventional tool paths, so different cutting parameters are used in slotting milling and general milling areas. The case study has demonstrated that the proposed methods can identify the optimal milling conditions and generate tool paths automatically and result in minimum milling time...|$|E

We first analyze how to emulate an original random geometric network G on a faulty network F. Our results state that, under the presence of some natural assumptions, random geometric networks can tolerate a constant node failure probability with a constant slowdown. In the case of constant edge failure probability the slowdown is an arbitrarily small constant times the logarithm of the graph order. Then we consider several network measures, stated as linear layout problems (Bisection, Minimum Linear Arrangement and Minimum <b>Cut</b> <b>Width).</b> Our results show that random geometric networks can tolerate a constant edge (or node) failure probability while maintaining the order of magnitude of the measures considered here. Finally we show that, with high probability, random geometric networks with (edge or node) faults do have a Hamiltonian cycle, provided the failure probability is constant. Such capability enables performing distributed computations based on end-to-end communication protocols. Postprint (published version...|$|E

The ultra-precise intra-tissue nanoprocessing is achieved by the generation of high light intensity (10 (12) W cm(- 2)) by diffraction-limited focusing of the radiation of an NIR (lambda = 740 and 800 nm) femtosecond titanium-sapphire laser to a sub-femtolitre volume and subsequent highly localized instantaneous plasma formation.

This research addresses important issues related to the environmental impact of manufacturing operations. Through a review of literature and industrial practices, the following requirements have been identified: (i) Sustainability performance measures which can be used to effectively identify potential inefficiency, and recommend ways of improvement; (ii) Optimisation of existing manufacturing process which take energy as an additional factor in the optimisation of machining processes; and (iii) Development of new machining processes and technologies that move closer to the theoretical boundaries of energy efficiency.

40|$|There are two {{standard}} ways of peeling an or-ange: either cut {{the skin}} along meridians, or cut it along a spiral. We consider here the second method, {{and study the}} shape of the spiral strip, when unfolded on a table. We derive a formula that describes the corresponding flattened-out spi-ral. Cutting the peel with progressively thinner strip widths, we obtain a sequence of increasingly long spirals. We show that, after rescaling, these spirals tends to a definite shape, known as the Eu-ler spiral. The Euler spiral has applications in many fields of science. In optics, the illumination intensity at a point behind a slit is computed from the distance between two points on the Euler spi-ral. The Euler spiral also provides optimal curva-ture for train tracks between a straight run and an upcoming bend. It is striking that it can be also obtained with an orange and a kitchen knife. 1. OUTLINE Cut the skin of an orange along a thin spiral of constant width (fig. 1) and lay it flat on a table (fig. 2). A natural breakfast question, for a mathematician, is which shape the spiral peel will have, when flattened out. We derive a formula that, for a given <b>cut</b> <b>width,</b> describes the corresponding spiral’s shape. For the analysis, we parametrize the spiral curve by a constant speed trajectory, and express the curva-ture of the flattened-out spiral as a function of time. This is achieved by comparing a revolution of the spiral on the orange with a corresponding spiral on a cone tangent {{to the surface of the}} orange (fig. 3, left). Once we know the curvature, we derive a differential equation for our spiral, which we solve analytically (fig. 4, left). We then consider what happens to our spirals when we vary the strip width.
