40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} public support and private donations by disaggregating the crowding effect into two components; one determined by level of public support and one determined by changes in public support levels. The analysis of a panel of American non-profit theatres shows that the crowding effect induced by the level of public support takes an inverted U shape: at low levels public support crowds-in private donations while at higher levels it displaces them. The change in total public support {{in the past year}} produces a constant <b>crowding-in</b> <b>effect</b> on the level of private donations. The paper finally illustrates how federal and state support have a <b>crowding-in</b> <b>effect</b> at all levels, while local support has a similar impact to total public support...|$|E

An assessment of crowding-in / crowding-out effects of investment in PPPs is carried out. We also proceed to the calculation of macroeconomic rates of return on investment in PPP, public investment and private investment. The results show that public and private investment has a positive effect in GDP while investment in PPP reduces the Portuguese GDP. In what concerns to crowding-in/crowding-out effects an increase in PPP investment crowds-out both in private and public investment, while public investment presents a <b>crowding-in</b> <b>effect</b> both in private investment and in investment in PPP; and private investment shows the same <b>crowding-in</b> <b>effect</b> both in investment in PPP and in public investment. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the long-run effects of public capital on private capital and tests the null of Granger non-causality {{between public and}} private capital in India. Both single-equation and system estimates of the model consistently suggest the long-run <b>crowding-in</b> <b>effects</b> of public capital. The error-correction as well as over-parameterized level-VAR models consistently suggest uni-directional Granger-causality from public to private capital. The support for the significant <b>crowding-in</b> <b>effects</b> of public capital has important implications for the formulation of long-term growth and development strategies. It underlines the need to accelerate public infrastructure to induce the distortions-free and market-driven increases in private capital and to attract the inflow of foreign direct investment. The inflows of foreign capital have witnessed perceptible increases {{since the beginning of the}} 1990 s. The geographical and sectoral distributions of FDI inflows remain asymmetric and skewed in favor of the select regions and the services industries. The services-sector-led growth needs to be accompanied by the commensurate performance of the goods-producing, agricultural and industrial, sectors so as to sustain the escalated trajectory of economic growth.

30|$|Not {{only the}} direct {{employment}} effects of FDI {{in developing countries}} have been unsubstantial but also the indirect effects have been minimal and possibly even negative. The outcome in terms of indirect effects depends on the balance between the <b>crowding-in</b> <b>effects</b> of FDI creating new markets for local investors and the crowding-out affects that arise when foreign affiliates displace local competitors. Foreign investors in developing economies have created very limited local linkages since they import most of their inputs (Rasiah and Gachino 2005).|$|R
30|$|This finding {{suggests}} that during a consolidation episode, employment {{tends to be more}} reactive to output than in normal times. If output is expanding then employment would expand more than in normal times, while if output is contracting, employment would contract more than in normal times. Hence, consolidating in good times (during output expansion) is here found to positively affect employment. The result is robust under a specification which includes the duration of the consolidation episode, expressed in number of years. Further, distinguishing between expenditure-driven and revenue-driven consolidation episodes, we find that the Okun’s coefficient is sensitive only to expenditure reduction and not increases in revenue. This is an interesting result which may highlight the presence of a <b>crowding-in</b> <b>effect</b> for the private sector when the government size in the economy shrinks. Yet an analysis of the change in the composition of spending during consolidation is necessary to accurately interpret the finding in light of a <b>crowding-in</b> <b>effect</b> for the private sector.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{to address the}} issue of complementarity and substitutability of state capital to private sector investment activities in a neoclassical growth framework. It employs a co-integrated vector autoregressive model to account for potential endogeneity and nonstationarity problems. Results suggest that both private and public capital spending have stimulated economic growth in Sudan over the period 1970 - 1998. The impact of private investment on real growth has been more pronounced than that of public sector investment. Public sector investment appears to have deleteriously impacted private sector physical capital expansion, implying that the impact of crowding-out categories of public sector investment has been large enough to offset any <b>crowding-in</b> <b>effects.</b> Such crowding out effect has weakened favourable positive effect that public sector's investment has exerted on growth by jeopardising private sector capital undertakings.

40|$|As {{economic}} incentives for biodiversity and ecosystem service protection (e. g., payments for ecosystem services) have become widespread in environmental science and policy, {{a major concern}} among conservationists and environmental scientists is that {{economic incentives}} may undermine people’s intrinsic motivations to conserve biodiversity. In this paper we review the theoretical insights and empirical findings on motivation crowding effects with economic instruments for biodiversity protection. First, we synthesize the psychological mechanisms behind motivation crowding effects relevant for environmental behavior as identified in the specialized literature. We then conduct a systematic review of the empirical evidence. Our results show that, although several empirical studies suggest the existence of crowding-out and <b>crowding-in</b> <b>effects,</b> evidence remains inconclusive due to i) methodological limitations for empirical studies to demonstrate crowding effects, ii) lack of adequate baseline information about pre-existing intrinsic motivations, iii) weak comparability of results across case studies resulting from inconsistent terminology and methods, and iv) the complexity stemming from cultural and contextual heterogeneity. We conclude that, as economic instruments for conservation are increasingly implemented, it becomes paramount to develop robust methodologies for assessing pre-existing intrinsic motivations and changes in people’s motivational structures. To address possible detrimental long term effects for conservation outcomes we call for caution in situations where high uncertainties remain...|$|R
40|$|We {{contribute}} to the growing empirical literature on monetary and fiscal interactions by applying a sign restriction identification scheme to a structural TVP-VAR in order to disentangle and evaluate the policy shocks and policy transmissions. This in turn allows us to study the Great Recession in a consistent fashion. Four facts stand out from our findings. We observe {{significant differences in the}} endogenous responses to shocks in particular between the Volcker period and the Great Recession, and find that monetary policy reacts more aggressively during Volcker chairmanship and fiscal policy during the Great Recession to stabilize the economy. Second, impulse responses confirm that there is a high degree of interactions between monetary and fiscal policies over time. Third, in the forecast error variance decomposition we find that while government revenues largely influence decisions on government spending, government spending does not influence tax decisions. Fourth and final, our analysis of the fiscal transmission channel reveals that tax cuts, because of their <b>crowding-in</b> <b>effects,</b> are more effective in expanding output than government spending rises, since the tax multiplier is higher and more persistent. In light of the current recession and the zero lower bound of the interest rate, tax cuts can, by providing the right incentives to the private sector, result in high and very persistent growth in output if private agent expectations regarding the length and the financing structure of the fiscal expansion are delicately managed jointly by the two authorities...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{documents}} time {{variation in}} fiscal policy multipliers in Germany, the UK and the US {{over the period}} 1971 - 2009. The analysis {{is based on a}} quarterly vector autoregression (VAR) model. For the German and the UK cases, the VAR is augmented by "global factors" representing developments in the world economy. By estimating these models on different samples of data, our evidence indicates that fiscal multipliers have substantially changed over time, often in a non-monotonic way. In particular, for Germany, the net tax multiplier is found to follow a humped-shaped curve, peaking {{in the middle of the}} 1990 s, declining thereafter, before rising again during the recent 2008 - 2009 crisis. Government spending shocks are found to be more powerful to stimulate output after the reunification. We show that significant <b>crowding-in</b> <b>effects</b> for private investments contribute to explain this finding. For the UK, we observe large variations in fiscal multipliers over the period, with non-Keynesian developments during the fiscal consolidation period of the 1980 s. After that, British multipliers are low and only pick up at the very end of the sample, when the 2008 - 2009 crisis is included in the analysis. For the US, short-run multipliers appear to be broadly stable over the period, but medium-run multipliers tend to decline, in particular in the end of the 1980 s and in the 1990 s. This can be due to the large fiscal imbalances over this period that may have triggered Ricardian effects, before a fiscal surplus was achieved at the end of the 1990 s...|$|R
