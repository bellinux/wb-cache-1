50|$|The Bolivia {{section of}} country studies {{published}} by the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress of the USA mentions the following:Bolivia's booming cocaine industry was also spawning serious health problems for Bolivian youth. In the 1980s, Bolivia became a drug-consuming country, {{as well as a}} principal exporter of cocaine. Addiction to <b>coca</b> <b>paste,</b> a cocaine by-product {{in the form of a}} cigarette called 'pitillo', was spreading rapidly among city youths. Pitillos were abundantly available in schools and at social gatherings. Other youths who worked as coca-leaf stompers (pisadores), dancing all night on kerosene and acid-soaked leaves, also commonly became addicted. The pitillo addict suffered from serious physical and psychological side-effects caused by highly toxic impurities contained in the unrefined <b>coca</b> <b>paste.</b> Coca-paste addiction statistics were unavailable, and drug treatment centers were practically nonexistent.|$|E
50|$|Bolivia's {{most lucrative}} crop in the 1980s was coca. The country {{was the second}} largest grower of coca in the world, {{supplying}} approximately 15 percent of the United States cocaine market in the late 1980s. Analysts believed that exports of <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> or cocaine generated from US$600 million to US$1 billion annually in the 1980s, depending on prices and output.|$|E
50|$|An {{unwanted}} {{by-product of}} Bolivia's cocaine industry was {{the importation of}} Colombian-style drug violence. In the late 1980s, Colombia's Medellín Cartel reportedly wielded considerable power in Bolivia, setting prices for <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> and cocaine and terrorizing the drug underworld with hired assassins. Furthermore, drug barons, organized into families, had established their own fiefdoms in Cochabamba, Beni, and Santa Cruz departments, using bribes and assassinations to destroy local authority.|$|E
50|$|The legal {{economy in}} the region is mostly based on logging and agriculture, and to a minor scale artisan fishing. Due to the {{presence}} of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla and other groups involved in the illegal drug trade business, the economy in Miraflores was ruled by coca. The <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> is sometimes used as currency, substituting the local Colombian peso or the US dollar.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{prevalent}} drugs among street children are everyday inhalants (i.e. paint, glue), marijuana, cough syrup, substituted amphetamines, cocaine, and hallucinogenic teas. In Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru, <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> {{is a popular}} drug for sale and use among street children. Though <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> is a precursor to cocaine made from coca leaves, {{studies have shown that}} it is more dangerous, as it contains toxic processing chemicals such as kerosene, sulfuric acid, and methanol, which are removed from cocaine. Glue is another frequently used and dangerous drug. In Honduras and Guatemala, children sniff Resistol, a toulene-based glue. Although toulene produces a desirable high, it is also a neurotoxin. Prolonged exposure leads to irreversible nerve damage, muscle deterioration, loss of brain function, dysfunctional kidneys and livers, and diminished ability to see and hear. Despite public outcry and pressure to change, the company that produces Resistol, H. B. Fuller, has generally denied its role in enabling the destructive behaviors of street children. They have replaced toluene with cyclohexene, another neurotoxin that produces the same high and has the same side effects.|$|E
50|$|Bolivia's {{most lucrative}} crop and {{economic}} {{activity in the}} 1980s was coca, whose leaves were processed clandestinely into cocaine. The country was the second largest grower of coca in the world, supplying approximately fifteen percent of the US cocaine market in the late 1980s. Analysts believed that exports of <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> and cocaine generated between US$600 million to US$1 billion annually in the 1980s (depending on prices and output). Based on these estimates, coca-related exports equaled or surpassed the country's legal exports.|$|E
5000|$|However, President Morales {{appears to}} be having some success in {{counter-narcotics}} efforts. Seizures of <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> and cocaine and destruction of drug laboratories have steadily increased since President Morales took office, and coca cultivation was down 13% in 2011 alone. Analysts such as Kathryn Ledebur and Colletta Youngers indicate that these successes have emerged from effective coca monitoring, increased economic development, and [...] "social control". Such improvements in Bolivia's narcotics situation have reportedly drawn attention {{and led to a}} slight diplomatic thaw with the United States; the two countries are expected to swap ambassadors.|$|E
50|$|It {{was common}} for smugglers in Colombia to import liquor, alcohol, {{cigarettes}} and textiles, while exporting cocaine. Personnel {{with knowledge of}} the terrain were able to supply the local market while also exporting a large amount of product. The established trade that began in the 1960s involved Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela and Cuba. Peasant farmers produced <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> in Peru and Bolivia, while Colombian smugglers would process the <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> into cocaine in Colombia, and trafficked product through Cuba. This trade route established ties between Cuban and Colombian organized crime. From Cuba, cocaine would be transported to Miami, Florida; and Union City, New Jersey. Quantities of the drug were then smuggled throughout the US. The international drug trade created political ties between the involved countries, encouraging the governments of the countries involved to collaborate and instate common policies to eradicate drug cartels. Cuba stopped being a center for transport of cocaine following the establishment of a communist government in 1959. As a result, Miami and Union City became the sole locations for trafficking. The relations between Cuban and Colombian organized crime remained strong until the 1970s, when Colombian cartels began to vie for power. In the 1980s and 90s, Colombia emerged as a key contributor of the drug trade industry in the Western Hemisphere. While the smuggling of drugs such as marijuana, poppy, opium and heroin became more ubiquitous during this time period, the activity of cocaine cartels drove the development of the Latin American drug trade. The trade emerged as a multinational effort as supplies (i.e. coca plant substances) were imported from countries such as Bolivia and Peru, were refined in Colombian cocaine labs and smuggled through Colombia, and exported to countries such as the US.|$|E

The coca plant, a tea-like shrub, was cultivated mostly by small farmers in the Chapare and Yungas regions. About 65 percent of all Bolivian coca was grown in the Chapare region of Cochabamba Department; other significant coca-growing areas consisted of the Yungas of La Paz Department and various areas of Santa Cruz and the Tarija Department.|$|E
50|$|Bolivian farmers {{rushed to}} grow coca in the 1980s as its price climbed {{and the economy}} collapsed. Soaring {{unemployment}} {{also contributed to the}} boom. In addition, farmers turned to coca for its quick economic return, its light weight, its yield of four crops a year, and the abundance of United States dollars available in the trade, a valuable resource in a hyperinflated economy. The Bolivian government estimated that coca production had expanded from 1.63 million kilograms of leaves covering 4,100 hectares in 1977 to a minimum of 45 million kilograms over an area of at least 48,000 hectares in 1987. The number of growers expanded from 7,600 to at least 40,000 over the same period. Besides growers, the coca networks employed numerous Bolivians, including carriers (zepeadores), manufacturers of <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> and cocaine, security personnel, and a large variety of other positions.

Bolivia's National Directorate for the Control of Dangerous Substances (Dirección Nacional para el Control de Substancias Peligrosas—DNCSP) was able to eradicate several thousand hectares of coca. These efforts, however, put only a small dent in the coca industry and were highly controversial among thousands of peasants. Under the joint agreement signed by the United States and Bolivia in 1987, which created DNCSP, Bolivia allocated US$72.2 million for the 1988 to 1991 period to eradication programs, including a wide-ranging rural development program for the Chapare region. The program was aided by an 88 percent drop in the local price of coca caused by the fall in cocaine prices in the United States.|$|E
40|$|Natural and {{agricultural}} resources {{for which there}} is a substantial black market, such as coca, opium, and diamonds, appear especially likely to be exploited by the parties to a civil conflict. On the other hand, these resources may also provide one of the few reliable sources of income in the countryside. In this paper, we study the economic and social consequences of a major shift in the production of <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> from Peru and Bolivia to Colombia, where most coca leaf is now harvested. This shift, which arose in response to the disruption of the "air bridge" that previously ferried <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> into Colombia, provided an exogenous boost in the demand for Colombian coca leaf. Our analysis shows this shift generated economic gains in rural areas, primarily in the form of increased self-employment earnings and increased labor supply by teenage boys. There is little evidence of widespread economic spillovers, however. The results also suggest that the rural areas which saw accelerated coca production subsequently became much more violent. Taken together, these findings support the view that the Colombian civil conflict is fueled by the financial opportunities that coca provides. This is in line with a recent literature which attributes the extension of civil conflicts to economic rewards and an environment that favors insurgency more than to the persistence of economic or political grievances. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis will be {{structured}} {{in the following}} way. The first section will examine {{the political and economic}} dimensions of the narcotics economy in Peru. It will analyze the significance of the coca leaf and <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> in the main economic aspects, as well as the socio-economic impact of narcotics in Peru. It will also analyze the dynamics of the coca industry. The politics of control and eradication evaluate the role of foreign aid and political pressure vis-a-vis the internal resistance and group interests in the national society. Therefore, the second section will examine the problems, strategies and solutions to tackle the underlying issues, analyzing the role of governments and the military, and the responsibility of supply and demand countries. It will outline Peru's position facing the drug trafficking problem, the U. S. intervention, the evaluation and measure of effectiveness, and options regarding drug control and alternative development policies. Finally, this thesis will conclude with some opinions.

40|$|Upon {{his presidential}} election, Bolivian coca grower leader Evo Morales adopted {{a policy of}} {{promoting}} consensual coca reduction through social control, a sophisticated coca monitoring system, and economic development. That strategy is paying off. In 2011, coca cultivation decreased by 13 per cent according to the U. S. government. The Morales administration has also made significant progress facing the ongoing challenges of drug production and trafficking. Seizures of <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> and cocaine and destruction of drug laboratories have steadily increased since President Morales took office. Despite continued tensions in bilateral relations, U. S. -Bolivian counter-drug cooperation continues and the signing of a new framework agreement in 2011 should lead to an exchange of ambassadors. Internationally, Bolivia has successfully gained acceptance {{of the right to}} the traditional use of coca within its own territory. But Bolivia’s efforts must be carried out in tandem with effective demand reduction strategies to shrink the global cocaine market...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of {{vast numbers of}} unsupervised and unprotected children is a phenomenon that is common throughout Latin America, and in few places are the street children more visible, and reviled, than in Brazil. Estimates of their numbers in Brazil have ranged from 7 to 17 million, but more informed assessments suggest that between 7 and 8 million children, ages 5 to 18, live and/or work {{on the streets of}} urban Brazil. Accounts of drug abuse among street youths in Brazil are commonplace. Numerous scientific studies and media stories have reported the widespread use of inhalants, marijuana and cocaine, and Valium among street children. Also common is the use of <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> and Rohypnol. Risk of exposure to HIV is rapidly becoming an area of concern because of the large number of street youths engaging in unprotected sexual acts, both renumerated and non-renumerated. Moreover, Brazil's street children are targets of fear. Because of their drug use, predatory crimes, and general unacceptability on urban thoroughfares, they are frequently the targets of local vigilante groups, drug gangs, and police "death squads. " Although there have been many proposals and programs for addressing the problems of Brazilian street youth, it would appear that onl...|$|E
40|$|Peasants {{who settled}} in the Colombian Amazon region {{as a result of}} {{different}} waves of migration and who today grow coca, have been stigmatized as criminals with no regional identity. The central state does not accord them a place within national society except as guerrilla auxiliaries or narcotraffickers and as such, they can be object of state violence. I argue that collective identities in the Amazon region are shaped by the sense of exclusion and abandonment from the central state, and that politicized identities emerge as a protest against exclusion and misrecognition. In 1996, the United States decertified the Colombian government from receiving further U. S. aid because their counter-narcotic efforts did not meet American parameters. As a response, the Colombian government increased the aerial spraying of coca plantations in the Amazon region, as well as the control of the sale of gray cement and gasoline, used for processing coca into <b>coca</b> <b>paste.</b> This increased enforcement of laws against illicit drug cultivation and processing sparked an uprising among coca growers and harvesters (cocaleros) in the departments of Putumayo, Caquetá, Guaviare, and the Baja Bota r gion of the Cauca department in the Colombian Amazon. During the months of July, August, and September of 1996, more than 200, 000 peasants, including women, children and indigenous people, marched from their farms to the nearest towns and departme tal capitals to protest this increased threat to their principal source of income.

40|$|Within {{the field}} of studies on drugs and security, the present {{dissertation}} is aimed at making, at least, three original contributions. First, from the traditional classification of illegal drugs –those derived from the coca leaf, those derived from the poppies, those derived from cannabis and the synthetic drugs– this study focuses on the coca-cocaine complex (CCC), i. e., the actors involved {{as well as the}} dimensions of production, manufacture, traffic and consumption of <b>coca</b> <b>paste,</b> cocaine base paste, cocaine hydrochloride, and its raw material, the coca leaf. The analysis was aimed at elucidating the way in which this complex has affected South America since the 1980 s, and Argentina in the post- 2001 crisis. Secondly, from a theoretical framework that combines an objectivist perspective of security with the constructivist Theory of Securitization, this dissertation not only deals with the material threats posed by the CCC, but also analyses the perceptions that South American and Argentinian political elites have developed and turned into security priority issues regarding the CCC. Finally, this thesis seeks to overcome the prevalent and traditional formulations on drugs and security studies, which have focused their analysis on the effects of drug trafficking on national security –the state-centered approach–. Instead, this dissertation widens the scope in order to integrate Argentina into South America as a Regional Security Complex (RSC) and as the geopolitical basis of the CCC. This, I consider, is the strongest contribution of this research work to the field, given the fact that, while there is an extensive bibliography on the CCC in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, there has been little research yielding information about the CCC in Argentina –arguably for its recent change of profile in the universe of drug trafficking...|$|E
40|$|Street drugs when {{in great}} demand in an illicit market become {{not only more}} {{expensive}} but are also subject to extensive adulteration and dilution. These fraudulent practices may {{also contribute to the}} amplification of toxic effects observed in the abuse of certain drugs including cocaine hydrochloride. The number of seizures reflects the increase of illicit use of cocaine powder in the city of S. Paulo, where the identity of the suspected drug is its hydrochloride form. Routine analytical procedures in enforcement laboratories in Brazil now comprise techniques involving thin layer chromatography for presumptive identification of the drug and eventually gas chromatography for its confirmation or quantification whenever required. The determination of cocaine content, adulterants and diluents in street samples is not only of clinical value but also important for enforcement activities, recognition of its geographical distribution and allocation. So, the aim {{of this study was to}} continue examining the quality of cocaine hydrochloride in the illicit market of the city of S. Paulo. Cocaine and adulterant contents were determined as well as the identification of several diluents in 389 out of 1958 samples of "white powder" seized in the city of São Paulo. Thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatography (FID) and GC-MS were used for the determination of cocaine and adulterant contents. Spot-tests and thin-layer chromatography were the techniques applied for the identification of diluents. The results were as follows: neither cocaine nor adulterants were detected in 17 samples (4. 4 %); of all positive samples (95. 6 %) for cocaine, 14 % consisted of no more than 200 mg/g; in 70 % cocaine purity ranged from 201 to 550 mg/g and in 16 % it was not greater than 700 mg/g. The local anesthetics lidocaine and procaine were detected in 19 samples (4, 9 %) in a range from 10 to 602 mg/g. Caffeine was present in only two samples (179 and 356 mg/g). The main diluents detected were carbonates and bicarbonates (19. 2 %); silicates (13. 8 %), sugars (9. 59 %); starch (5. 6 %), borate (3. 8 %) and sulphates(2. 8 %). Contaminants (secondary products) originated from <b>coca</b> <b>paste</b> refining or decomposition processes were not analysed. Teores de cocaína e adulterantes bem como vários diluentes foram determinados em 389 amostras de pó branco apreendidas na cidade de São Paulo, no ano de 1997. Cocaína e seus adulterantes foram analisados por cromatografia em camada delgada, cromatografia em fase gasosa (detetor de ionização de chama) e cromatografia em fase gasosa acoplado a espectrometria de massa (CG/MS). Diluentes foram analisados através de "spot tests" e da cromatografia em camada delgada. Foram obtidos os seguintes resultados: em 4, 4 % das amostras não foram detectados cocaína e adulterantes; de todas as amostras positivas para cocaína, 14 % não continham mais que 200 mg/g de pó; em 70 % a pureza da cocaína variou de 201 a 550 mg/g e em 16 % não foi maior que 700 mg/g. Os anestésicos locais lidocaína e procaína foram detectados em 19 amostras em concentrações que variaram de 10 a 602 mg/g de pó. Cafeína foi encontrada em duas amostras. Os principais diluentes detectados foram: carbonatos e bicarbonatos, silicatos, açúcares, amido, borato e sulfatos.
