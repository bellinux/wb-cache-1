Many of these analyses which are performed, are vital for the operation, quality control and monitoring of the products produced in the industry, as well as the byproducts and effluents produced by these processes. Unfortunately, many of these analyses are prone to interferences, which lead to troublesome, inaccurate and costly analyses.

40|$|Natural oils such as {{pine oil}} and {{eucalyptus}} oil {{were used in}} metalliferrous flotation, principally as frothers, {{in the early days}} of flotation In recent years synthetic collectors and frothers have taken over, largely because the complex chemistry and wide variation in natural oils results in poor control of their consistency as flotation reagents. Australia, however, has enormous potential as a supplier of eucalyptus oils. If one or more eucalypt species were identified as desirable sources of coal flotation reagents, it would be logical to cultivate them in industrial plantations on mine sites and to have this form of land use accepted as a satisfactory end point for rehabilitation. Such an outcome would have multiple benefits for the mining industry. Essential oils derived from eucalypts are composed predominantly of terpenes, compounds which contain a sequence of two or more isoprene units (C 5 H 8). Gas Chromatography (GC) tests, coupled with Mass Spectrometry (MS) and Flame Ionisation Detection (FID) were carried out on oils from ten different eucalypt species in order to identify those oils, or their constituents, that might have useful properties for the flotation of coal.

40|$|In Australia, coal {{washability}} analysis, {{which is}} used to obtain the cumulative yield—ash % relationship—has traditionally been generated using the float-sink method AS 4156. 1 - 1994. This technique relies on heavy organic liquids to fractionate coal and mineral particles based on particle density. These organic liquids are considered problematic for health, safety, and environmental reasons. This paper examines water-based methods for attaining coal washability data for - 50 + 0. 045 mm particles, covering a water fluidization method based on the Reflux Classifier, and two batch jigging devices. Data produced by the three methods are compared with results obtained using the float-sink method. The cumulative yield versus cumulative <b>ash</b> <b>curves</b> generated by all three methods were found to be in reasonable agreement with the data obtained using the float-sink method, but with a consistent discrepancy evident at relatively low ash levels. The discrepancy was attributed to the effects of dispersion, a phenomenon inherent in most particle separation processes. The fractionation achieved using the Reflux Classifier required further fractionation by size separation, while the two jigs generally required no fractionation by size provided the initial size range was not too broad. The Boner Jig, in which the vessel is moved up and down at a given frequency and amplitude, showed the best performance on the - 16 + 0. 25 mm sizerange. The Mintek Jig, in which the upward fluid flow is varied, showed the best performance on the - 50 + 16 mm size range. For the ultrafine particles, covering the size range - 0. 25 + 0. 045 mm, the Reflux Classifier proved to be the ideal choice, achieving higher yields than multistage flotation. It was also demonstrated, using the data from the Reflux Classifier, that the ‘‘true’’ washability data could be deduced mathematically by combining a model of the separation process, with the normalized partition curve...|$|R

Despite the advantages of biomass in reducing carbon emissions from the electricity sector, the co-firing of high percentages of biomass can potentially aggravate ash related problems in the boiler.

Furthermore, the melting behaviour of ashes from pure coal, pine, and their blends were studied through ash fusion tests (AFT) and via a method using a simultaneous thermal analyser coupled to mass spectrometer (STA-MS) for the evolved gas analysis.

40|$|Leachate {{collection}} systems {{consist of}} a series of pipes installed beneath the waste {{at the base of a}} landfill. The liquid drains toward a central location where it is pumped and then treated, discharged, or recirculated. In some landfills, solid precipitates form in the collection system resulting in clogging and malfunctions of the drainage system. The formation of the precipitates is linked to the chemical and biological stability of the leachate generated within the landfill. To control the formation of precipitates and prevent clogging of leachate collection systems, it is important to understand factors that influence leachate <b>characteristics.</b> <b>Ashes</b> from municipal solid waste (MSW) combustion are either placed in monofills or combined with traditional solid waste, and sludges and biosolids from wastewater and drinking water treatment plants when landfilled. The ashes, depending on the type of combustion process, contain high concentrations of metals and non-biodegradable materials. As the waste degrades, oxygen in the landfill is consumed and the leachate becomes anaerobic. The reducing environment allows for greater solubility of metals. This research tested ashes from three different Waste-to-Energy (WTE) facilities to understand better the role MSW fly ash and MSW bottom ash in the chemical make-up of landfill leachate. Two different types of batch tests were used to analyze the leaching behavior.

In addition to operational conditions, {{the extent to which}} these elements are released to the gas phase may be affected by fuel <b>ash</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as the ash composition and the speciation (or association) of ash-forming elements in the fuel matrix. In the present work, the influence of these fuel <b>ash</b> <b>characteristics</b> on the extent to which K, Cl, and S are released from biomass fuels to the gas phase was studied under steam-fluidized bed gasification.

The speciation of these elements in the virgin fuels was studied with chemical fractionation. The results reveal that the extent to which S is released from biomass fuels to the gas phase mainly depends on its speciation in the fuel matrix.
