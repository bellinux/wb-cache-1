50|$|The primary {{structural}} feature of Tatra trucks is the <b>central</b> <b>load</b> carrying tube, also called a backbone frame. All {{other parts of}} the truck are mounted to this rigid assembly. The inherently high torsional and flexural rigidity of this layout protects superstructures from the motions and forces on the axles. Torque distribution to the axles is also carried within the backbone.|$|E
50|$|The {{design was}} based on the proven Tatra concept of a {{backbone}} tube chassis construction with swing half axles, a modular gearbox and differential assemblies. The main advantages of the <b>central</b> <b>load</b> carrying backbone tube are its high torsion and bend strength, which protects the truck body against load stresses. The secondary advantage is that it houses all important parts of the drivetrain. Due to its torsional stiffness and use of differentials locks the vehicle had exceptional offroad capabilities. Of note was the ability to use a cranking handle to start the engine.|$|E
30|$|<b>Central</b> <b>loading</b> {{resulted}} in the least compressed displacement in all placements in the experimental models {{as well as the}} FEA models.|$|R
30|$|Both {{experimental}} and FEA models suffered the least compressed displacement during <b>central</b> <b>loading</b> in all placements. The greatest stress and compressive strain {{was on the}} load side in all types of placements.|$|R
30|$|<b>Central</b> <b>loading</b> {{resulted}} in the lowest equivalent stress value, while buccal and lingual loading showed substantially similar values (Figure  12 b). In the bone surrounding the implant tip, the loading point was a significant factor for the equivalent stress value (p[*]<[*] 0.01) (Table  6). The maximum CV was 45.99 % in the contact model and 19.79 % in the fixation model (Table  7).|$|R
50|$|The {{design was}} of central {{backbone}} tube construction with modular power train concept in 4x4, 4x2, 6x6, 6x4 and 6x2 configuration. Version 4x2, 6x4 and 6x2 were produced in very low quantity. The main advantages of <b>central</b> <b>load</b> carrying backbone tube are in its high torsion and bend strength protecting truck body against load stresses. The secondary {{advantage is that}} it houses all important parts of the drive train. In addition, it enables a concept of modular construction where designers and customers can specify 4, 6, wheel drive and various length and wheelbase combinations.|$|E
50|$|The tubular {{backbone}} {{construction was}} once again selected. The main advantages of <b>central</b> <b>load</b> carrying backbone tube are in its high torsional and bending stiffness protecting the truck's body against load stresses. Another advantage is that it houses all important parts of the drive train {{as well as it}} enables a concept of modular construction where designers and customers can specify 4,6,8, wheel drive and various length wheelbase combinations. A new cab-over-engine design was implemented, as were the wide profile super single tyres and central tyre inflation/deflation system.|$|E
50|$|Yet again design {{continued}} with the proven central backbone tube construction and power train {{integrated into the}} central backbone tube as a modular concept in 4x4 and 6x6 configuration. A new feature was the inter-axle differential. The main advantages of the <b>central</b> <b>load</b> carrying backbone tube are in its high torsion and bend strength, which protects the truck body against load stresses. The secondary advantage is that it houses all important parts of the drive train {{as well as it}} enables a concept of modular construction where designers and customers can specify 4 and 6 wheel drive, as well as various length wheelbase combinations.|$|E
30|$|The {{equivalent}} stress values {{in both the}} contact and fixation models were smallest for <b>central</b> <b>loading,</b> while buccal and lingual loading showed substantially equivalent values {{greater than that of}} <b>central</b> <b>loading.</b> Equivalent stress occurrence sites were observed to be high in bone surrounding the implant neck on the loading side, similar to previous reports [36, 37]. Hobo et al. [38] stated that while implants were resistant to vertical pressure, horizontal pressure (bending movements) generated torque in the implants and had more harmful effects; therefore, {{it would be wise to}} limit the occlusal contact of the superstructure to vertical pressure and avoid horizontal pressure as much as possible. This was also consistent with reports that lateral loading generated more stress than vertical loading, as is also found in Sato et al.’s report using a geometric analysis [39], and supports the existing clinical concept that a lateral force applied to an implant greatly increases the stress in the surrounding bone.|$|R
30|$|<b>Central</b> {{concentrated}} <b>load</b> {{is applied}} in increments (1, 2, 3 kg, etc.) {{at the center}} of the beam.|$|R
30|$|In all placements, the {{compressed}} displacement {{in the experimental}} models and FEA models was greatest with buccal loading and smallest with <b>central</b> <b>loading</b> at the three loading points. For both the experimental models and the FEA models, {{the compressed}} displacement during buccal loading with straight placement was significantly greater than that with the L-offset (P[*]<[*] 0.05). The compressed displacement during lingual loading with straight placement was significantly greater than that with the B-offset (P[*]<[*] 0.05).|$|R
50|$|The three point {{bending test}} is a {{classical}} experiment in mechanics. It represents {{the case of}} a beam resting on two roller supports and subjected to a concentrated load applied {{in the middle of the}} beam. The shear is constant in absolute value: it is half the <b>central</b> <b>load,</b> P / 2. It changes sign in the middle of the beam. The bending moment varies linearly from one end, where it is 0, and the center where its absolute value is PL / 4, is where the risk of rupture is the most important.The deformation of the beam is described by a polynomial of third degree over a half beam (the other half being symmetrical).|$|E
50|$|When {{examined}} by the driver and fireman, one of the cast iron girders of the bridge {{was found to have}} fractured, unusually, near to one of the abutments rather than at the centre of the beam. The track was supported by a pair of identical girders with Barlow rails cut to length laid across the inner flange, with asphalted ballast on top, just below the sleepers. When Captain Henry Whatley Tyler of the Railway Inspectorate examined the fracture surface, he found it rusted over, but the evidence of those who had seen it first, showed just what had happened. The cast iron girder had broken vertically from an enormous defect in the web and flanges, where there was a complete gap between the sides. The girder was completely defective here, but why no one had spotted it before the accident remains a mystery. Tyler suggests that it may have grown from an internal void with time, simply because such a defect would surely have been discovered either by the foundry or the builders. The girder had been installed 23 years before, in 1837, and should have supported a <b>central</b> <b>load</b> of 90 tons if in good condition. The pair of girders should have supported a total load of 360 tons distributed over all the structure, and Tyler stated that the girder was much bigger than was needed for the job. The engine weighed 31 tons and the tender 18 tons.|$|E

25|$|Blast mining or {{conventional}} mining, is {{an older}} practice that uses explosives such as dynamite {{to break up}} the coal seam, after which the coal is gathered and loaded onto shuttle cars or conveyors for removal to a <b>central</b> <b>loading</b> area. This process consists of a series of operations that begins with “cutting” the coalbed so it will break easily when blasted with explosives. This type of mining accounts for less than 5 percent of total underground production in the US today.|$|R

The axial forces problem in installations mounted along the ship's open decks executed from hull deformations on waves and thermal stresses is given. Use of "U" type expansion loops is described.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to obtain helmet-to-head contact forces from experiments, use a human head finite element model to determine regional responses, and compare outputs to skull fracture and brain injury thresholds. Tests were conducted using two types of helmets (A and B) fitted to a head-form. Seven load cells were used on the head-form back face to measure helmet-to-head contact forces. Projectiles were fired in frontal, left, right, and rear directions. Three tests were conducted with each helmet in each direction. Individual and summated force- and impulse-histories were obtained. Force-histories were inputted to the human head-helmet finite element model. Pulse durations were approximately 4. ms. One-third force and impulse were from the <b>central</b> <b>load</b> cell. 0. 2 % strain and 40. MPa stress limits were not exceeded for helmet-A. For helmet-B, strains exceeded in left, right, and rear; pressures exceeded in bilateral directions; volume of elements exceeding 0. 2 % strains correlated with the <b>central</b> <b>load</b> cell forces. For helmet-A, volumes exceeding brain pressure threshold were: 5 - 93 %. All elements crossed the pressure limit for helmet-B. For both helmets, no brain elements exceeded peak principal strain limit. These findings advance our understanding of skull and brain biomechanics from helmet-head contact forces. © 2013...|$|E
40|$|The finite {{difference}} {{method has}} been used to solve the differential equation for the critical loading associated with a specific lateral-torsional buckling test configuration. The linear elastic analysis is valid for thin-walled composite doubly symmetric I-beams made from mid-plane symmetric, fibre-reinforced laminated panels. Here, the test configuration has an I-beam with specially orthotropic panels. It is subjected to three-point bending, and supported at each end such that the only degree of freedom is rotation about the major axis of the beam. For the modelling case where the <b>central</b> <b>load</b> is applied at the shear centre (centroid) of the cross-section there is a favourable comparison between the finite difference results and those results presented by Timoshenko and Gere (1961, Theory of Elastic Stability 2 nd edn, McGraw-Hill, New York), which were originally generated for isotropic beams. A favourable comparison has also been found between the finite difference analysis and experimental evidence using an E-glass fibre-reinforced polymeric pultruded I-beam, where the <b>central</b> <b>load</b> is now applied to the top compression flange. The various theoretical models presented in the paper are used to show that the critical loading for buckling in real composite I-beams will be strongly dependent on both the support boundary conditions and the height of the loading relative to the centroid (shear centre) ...|$|E

An effective materials management program can also resolve “island” approaches to shipping, receiving, and vehicle movement. Solutions can include creating a new <b>central</b> <b>loading</b> location, as well consolidating service areas and docks from separate buildings into one. Developing better campus circulation infrastructure also means re-evaluating truck delivery and service vehicle routes.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{non-linear}} behaviour of a pin-ended circular arch with unequal rotational end restraints is complicated. The arch with unequal rotational end restraints under a <b>central</b> concentrated <b>load</b> may have a nonlinear equilibrium path that consists of one, two, or four unstable equilibrium paths and two or four limit points, and it may even have a nonlinear looped equilibrium path in some cases. However, it is conventionally thought that the nonlinear equilibrium path of a pin-ended circular arch under the <b>central</b> concentrated <b>load</b> has only one unstable equilibrium path with two limit points. This paper revisits the non-linear in-plane responses of pin-ended circular arches to the <b>central</b> concentrated <b>load.</b> It is shown that the equilibrium path of the non-linear in-plane responses may also has three, five, or nine equilibrium paths with two, four, and eight limit points. It is found the modified slenderness of an arch plays an important role for the number of the unstable paths and limit points...|$|R

So, the stress flow configuration {{and the formation of}} struts were seen in perspective. How much deformable is the ground, more uniform are the reactions distribution observed be-tween the piles. The column cross section influenced the configuration of the connecting struts. The concrete strength variation had more influence in the pile caps strength than the stiffness.

This paper presents an experimental study about two pile caps reinforced concrete with external, partially embedded and embedded socket submitted to <b>central</b> <b>load,</b> using 1 : 2 scaled models. In the analyzed models, the smooth interface between the socket walls and column was considered. The results are compared to a reference model that presents monolithic connections between the column and pile cap. It is observed that the ultimate load of pile cap with external sockets has the same magnitude as the reference pile cap, but the ultimate load of models with partially embedded and embedded socket present less magnitude than the reference model...|$|E
40|$|We {{adopted the}} {{psychological}} refractoriness paradigm to study whether visual pattern goodness affects <b>central</b> processing <b>load</b> in a same-different task. In a dual-task experiment, a two-alternative forced choice auditory classification {{was followed by}} a same-different task in which Garner’s classical five-dot patterns were presented. Goodness of these patterns and stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) {{between the first and second}} task were varied between trials. Participants used a physical sameness criterion; only patterns of the same shape and orientation were responded to as same. Strong effects of pattern goodness and SOA were found, and both factors had additive effects on response latencies. This result was taken as evidence that pattern goodness determines <b>central</b> processing <b>load</b> in the physical sameness task. The result is consistent with Lachmann and van Leeuwen (2007 a), in which a categorical sameness task was used. Comparing both studies it was concluded that goodness reduces the <b>central</b> processing <b>load</b> of visual stimulus information independently of task variation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The elastic {{response}} of a circular single graphene sheet with {{a diameter of}} 65. 32 Å under a transverse <b>central</b> <b>load</b> is studied using molecular dynamics (MD), closed-form elasticity solution (EL), and finite element method (FEM). Results showed that the mismatch in deformation profiles between MD calculations and continuum mechanics methods is about 8 ~ 9 % at a central deflection of one graphene layer thickness. The mismatch reduces to less than 5 % when the central deflection increased to a 10 -layer thickness. The mismatch rooted from mechanics: MD predicts predominant bond stretching mode while continuum mechanics predict a bending to stretching transition process under increasing deflection. Results suggest that continuum mechanics can yield predictions close to molecular mechanics under large deformation for certain loading configurations when modes of deformation are similar. 1...|$|E
40|$|Increase {{proliferation}} of microgrid (MG) technologies with extended use {{of renewable energy}} sources (RES) can affect the system stability performance since dynamic characteristics {{of this kind of}} MG are different from conventional generation. Sharing certain portion of or entire generated power from synchronous generator with MG results in decrease of total system inertia. On the other hand, connecting RES based MG near a <b>central</b> <b>load</b> eventually enhance system performance due to improvement in reliability, reduction of power loss and congestion on transmission line. This paper investigates the impact of RES based MG on local and inter-area oscillatory modes of power systems. This study focuses on low oscillatory eigenvalues in the frequency range of 0. 1 - 2 Hz. Eigenvalues analysis is performed to observe damping ratios and stability margins of the system due to MG integration. Furthermore, time domain simulation is then carried out to validate the result from eigenvalues analysis...|$|E
30|$|Operators in high-stress domains {{often need}} to divide {{attention}} between {{the central and}} peripheral visual fields. A pilot, for example, must also monitor for cockpit alerts while maintaining awareness of an aircraft’s position in space (Wickens, Sebok, McCormick, & Walters, 2016), and operators in air traffic control must remain responsive to critical alerts while managing the flow of air traffic (Imbert et al., 2014). Similarly, {{the increasing use of}} head-worn displays in professional roles means that many operators are required to switch attention between tasks within their central visual field and peripheral events projected onto the headset (Pascale et al., 2015). Within each of these domains, performing effectively means processing information presented centrally, while also discriminating between critical and non-critical “noise” events in the visual periphery. For system designers, this issue implies a need to understand the task and display characteristics that maximize peripheral detection and discrimination under conditions of high <b>central</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E

The study was performed in <b>central</b> <b>loading</b> conditions using strip and rectangular footings. The vertical stresses resulting from the external are measured for three different distances simultaneously. And also the load-settlement curves were obtained. The {{results showed that the}} bearing capacity increases when the length of the footing increases and the measured vertical stress values decrease along the depths for all the three types of the footing types.

In order to obtain a finite value to the bending moment, we draw upon the exact deflection expressions from the classical and higher-order plate theories of Mindlin and of Reddy, and make some reasonable assumptions such as the maximum deflection of Mindlin plate being equal to the maximum deflection of the corresponding Reddy plate and the constancy of the Mindlin shear correction factor...|$|R

It was concluded that intermediate relative stiffness leads to moderate deformations when uplift is permitted. Very flexible footings produce higher deformations in unilateral contact compared to bilateral contact, and thus {{should be considered in}} their design. Unilateral contact does not significantly increase deformations for stiff footings subjected to concentrated <b>central</b> <b>loading.</b> However, relatively large deformation differences occur when the loading is eccentric, necessitating consideration of uplift in their design...|$|R
