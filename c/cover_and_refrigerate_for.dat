50|$|Hollow fiber bioreactors {{are used}} to {{generate}} high concentrations of cell-derived products including monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, growth factors, viruses and virus-like particles.

Therefore, as a cell line (e.g., hybridoma) expands and expresses a target protein, that protein remains within the EC space and is not flushed out.

This {{study was designed}} to evaluate the effect of storage and cooking time on the antioxidant properties of two commonly used Ghanaian vegetables: Corchorus olitorius and Solanum macrocarpon locally known as “adeimey” and “gboma” respectively. The storage conditions were: Left to stand overnight at room temperature, <b>refrigerated</b> <b>for</b> one day <b>and</b> <b>refrigerated</b> <b>for</b> one week, <b>and</b> cooked for ten and thirty minutes at 100 ºC. The reducing power and the total carotenoid content were determined by measuring absorbance using a Shimadzu UV- 120 - 02 spectrophotometer at 700 nm and 450 nm respectively. The free radical scavenging activity was determined by the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazil (DPPH) method. The antioxidant activity (AOA) ranged from 91. 59 to 38. 42 %. The total carotenoid content (TCC) varied from 5. 10 to 27. 30 mg/ 100 g. The reducing power ranged from 9. 52 to 50. 59 %. The results show that Solanum macrocarpon and Corchorus olitorius are good sources of antioxidants with the later exhibiting higher antioxidant properties than the former. However the AOA, TCC and reducing power decreased drastically when the vegetables were <b>refrigerated</b> <b>for</b> one day <b>and</b> one week and cooked for thirty minutes at 100 ºC. Similarly the AOA, TCC and reducing power decreased slightly when the stored vegetables were cooked for ten minutes. These findings suggest modification in the storage and cooking practices of these green {{leafy vegetables}} to ensure retention of antioxidants for the best nutritional value and health benefit.

40|$|Regulations {{concerning}} {{the storage of}} transfusable plasma differ internationally. In Canada, plasma obtained from whole blood donations and frozen within 24 hours of phlebotomy (frozen plasma, FP) may be thawed and transfused within 120 hours of refrigerated storage. However, plasma frozen within 8 hours of phlebotomy following apheresis donation (FFPA) must be transfused within 24 hours of thawing and refrigeration. Our objectives were to measure coagulation factors (F) V, VII, and VIII, fibrinogen activities, and the prothrombin time (PT) in thawed refrigerated FFPA at 0, 24, and 120 hours of storage and to compare these values to those in thawed refrigerated FP. Fibrinogen activity remained unchanged over time, while mean factor levels in 28 FFPA units declined by 17 % (FV), 19. 7 % (FVII), and 54. 6 % (FVIII) over 120 hours, while PT values rose to 7. 6 %. Factor activities were significantly higher in FFPA than FP after 120 hours of refrigerated storage.

40|$|Background: Tissue {{inhibitor}} of metalloproteinases- 1 (TIMP- 1) {{in blood}} {{might be a}} helpful biomarker in various diseases. However, various authors report that TIMP- 1 is dependent on preanalytical procedures. Our study was performed to determine how storage conditions and time to centrifugation influence TIMP- 1. Materials and Methods: Twenty-six blood specimens were collected from each of 20 volunteers. Two specimens from each person were centrifuged/measured within 1 h after venipuncture and frozen at - 80 degrees C. They were thawed once or twice within 72 h. Eight specimens were stored at 20 degrees C in daylight, 8 at 20 degrees C <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> 8 at 4 C in daylight. Four {{of each of these}} 8 specimens were mixed once a day until centrifugation. A mixed and an unmixed specimen of each group was centrifuged/measured after 3, 6, 24 and 72 h. Results: TIMP- 1 increased after freeze/ thaw (p < 0. 001). Mixing blood specimens more than once caused increased TIMP- 1 (p < 0. 001). TIMP- 1 increased within 3 h of storage (p < 0. 001). The increase was lower in specimens <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> <b>refrigerated</b> (p < 0. 001). Conclusion: TIMP- 1 is unstable and has to be evaluated carefully. Blood should be centrifuged directly after venipuncture. For routine application, specimen handling must be standardized and carefully followed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa {{umbilical}} cord blood {{may be a}} useful source of blood for transfusion. Before clinical trials, evidence is needed that cord blood donations, which vary greatly in volume, can be collected and stored into a fixed volume of anticoagulant-preservative solution obviating the need for prestorage processing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-four {{umbilical cord}} whole blood (UC-WB) donations were collected into 21 mL of CPDA- 1 <b>and</b> <b>refrigerated</b> <b>for</b> 35 days. The Kenya Blood Transfusion Service provided 12 adult-donated whole blood (AD-WB) controls. Supernatant hemoglobin (Hb) and potassium were assayed at 7 -day intervals. RESULTS: UC-WB red blood cell hemolysis and potassium loss increased throughout storage but {{did not differ significantly}} with cord blood volume. Hemolysis rates did not differ significantly between UC-WB and AD-WB but UC-WB potassium loss was slightly but significantly greater than AD-WB on Days 2, 7, and 14 (p < 0. 05). In the AD-WB controls, eight were low volume (< 405 mL), two had total Hb of less than 45 g, and two showed hemolysis greater than 0. 8 % by Day 28. CONCLUSION: Variable volumes of UC-WB can be stored for 35 days without prestorage processing and further work into its suitability for transfusion to children is justified.
