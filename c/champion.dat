5|$|CMLL has {{declared}} the championship vacant on two separate occasions, {{which meant that}} there was no <b>champion</b> for a period of time.

In late 2013 the light heavyweight <b>champion</b> Rush was working a long-running storyline rivalry with El Terrible. When El Terrible won the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship, CMLL decided to enhance the rivalry by having Rush voluntarily give up the light heavyweight championship in order to receive a CMLL World Heavyweight Championship match against El Terrible. This allowed CMLL to advance the storyline as well as move the championship off Rush without having Rush lose a match, allowing Rey Escorpión to become the next <b>champion.</b> The second vacancy started on May 22, 2017 when CMLL fired the then-champion Máscara.|$|E
