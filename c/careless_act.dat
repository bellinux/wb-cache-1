40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{in depth}} {{the question of}} whether section 420 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) imposes ‘strict liability’ upon a controller for the failure of an agent or expert to take reasonable care. The weight of existing authority appears to suggest that controllers are liable under s 420 A for the carelessness of their agents or expert advisers. However, a closer analysis of the text of the provision and relevant Australian and UK case law demonstrates that this aspect of the statutory construction of s 420 A remains very much an open question. This article ultimately contends for a construction of s 420 A which requires a controller to adequately supervise and scrutinise, but which does not render a blameless controller strictly liable for all <b>careless</b> <b>acts</b> and omissions of agents and expert advisers...|$|R

5000|$|The Court then cited City of Kamloops v. Nielsen (1984) {{to say the}} [...] "duty of care" [...] that {{a mother}} has for a child is not forced on the mother by courts through public policy. Only a {{legislature}} can consider such an issue. Following Kamloops, the Court said a duty of care is recognized if the involved people are closely related, and if the issue does not raise questions about public policy. While fetuses and their mothers have often legally been seen as one person, {{for the purposes of}} this case the Court addressed the issue as if they were two people. This satisfied the requirement that the involved people, namely Cynthia Dobson and her fetus, were closely related. As the Court noted, [...] "almost any <b>careless</b> <b>act</b> or omission by a pregnant woman could be expected to have a detrimental impact on foetal development." [...] However, the issue raised questions of public policy; it implicated privacy rights of a pregnant woman and her bodily control. [...] In this sense, it involved consideration that pregnancy may be the [...] "human condition" [...] most [...] "important to society" [...] as it preserves the human race. Moreover, pregnancy symbolizes [...] "fertility and hope." [...] Cory cautioned, however, that despite all this, a woman remains a person with rights. [...] The issue of a pregnant woman's responsibilities ran deep, deeper than that of another person who could be sued for causing damage to someone else's fetus. The pregnant woman's relevant activities would include what [...] "the pregnant woman eats or drinks, and every physical action she takes" [...] and this involves [...] "every waking and sleeping moment, in essence, her entire existence." [...] Whereas a mother has emotional responsibilities for a fetus, adding a tort dimension to this would seriously alter it.|$|E

40|$|Background: In recent years, {{operating}} theatre nurse students’ education {{focused on}} ethics, basic values and protecting and promoting the patients’ dignity in perioperative practice. Health professionals are frequently confronted with ethical issues that can impact on patient’s care during surgery. Objective: The {{objective of this}} study was to present what operating theatre nursing students perceived and interpreted as undignified caring in perioperative practice. Research design: The study has a descriptive design with a hermeneutic approach. Data were collected using Flanagan’s critical incident technique. Participants and research context: Operating theatre nurse students from Sweden and Norway participated and collected data in 2011, after education in ethics and dignity. Data consisting of 47 written stories and the text were analysed with hermeneutical text interpretation. Ethical considerations: The study was approved by the Karlstad University’s Research Ethics Committee. Findings: The findings show careless behaviour and humiliating actions among health professionals. Health professionals commit <b>careless</b> <b>acts</b> by rendering the patient invisible, ignoring the patient’s worry and pain and treating the patient as an object. They also humiliate the patient when speaking in negative terms about the patient’s body, and certain health professionals blame the patients for the situation they are in. Health professionals lack the willingness and courage to protect the patient’s dignity in perioperative practice. Discussion: In the discussion, we have illuminated how professional ethics may be threatened by more pragmatic and utilitarian arguments contained in regulations and transplant act. Conclusion: The findings reveal that patients were exposed to unnecessary suffering; furthermore, the operating theatre nurse students suffered an inner ethical conflict due to the undignified caring situations they had witnessed...|$|R
40|$|Citation: Thurston, Warren Bunn. The {{process of}} making butter from sweet cream. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1906. Introduction: Among all of the {{branches}} of the dairy business there is none so important as that of butter making. The demand for good butter is far greater than the supply and the regular customer and the fancy trade make money for the creamery man. Now we must consider some of the different factors in the making of butter, they are numerous but I merely cite a few. First the churn; there are limitless varieties of churns from the goat skin bag swinging in the air to the rotary churn run by power. Between these two extremes are found the dasher churn, the hand power barrel churn and many others. They will all make butter and they are all good, but some are better than others. Much depends on the sanitary conditions of the churn. No one can make good butter in an unclean or unsanitary churn. There is much room for improvement in this line. Another important factor is the butter maker. Any one can pour cream into a churn and start to going but not every one can make good butter. Just as in every line of work much depends on the "man behind the churn. " To be successful the butter maker must be a man of tact and perseverance and believe in the maxim that if at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. If the cream is too sweet or too sour, too warm or too cold, too old or with bad odor, etc., there will be trouble and the butter maker has more control over these influences than any one else. The most important factor is the cream. The indiscriminate dumping together of all kinds of cream in a single churning is a <b>careless</b> <b>act</b> and can only result in a poor grade of butter...|$|E
40|$|The {{profession}} {{of law is}} an important mediator between the justice and the individual in terms of representing defense {{as a part of}} fair hearing and providing individuals to use their constitutional rights and liberties. If the lawyer causes any damage to his client or the person whom he renders a legal advice, he is confronted with action for damages. The insurance company liberates the lawyer from this liability. In the study, firstly, the place, the principles and field of application of liability insurance in the Turkish insurance law are examined. Especially there have been considerations about the application of theories that are associated with the determination of realization moment of the risk on professional liability insurance. The definition of the {{profession of}} law, the effects of the professional obligations to liability and the relationship between liability and the 'contract and tort relation' were introduced. The subject is also researched in terms of advocacy partnership with the changes that are made in the Law of Advocates which took its place in our country but which is hardly seen in enforcement. It would be useful to make lawful arrangements as soon as possible to make lawyers have the compulsory liability insurance in the beginning of their profession due to the possible compensation threats that can be caused from act of omission. To prevent the lawyer from tending to <b>careless</b> <b>acts</b> some arrangements can be done with precautions like; leaving some portion of the risk on the lawyer, in case of existing any disciplinary action premiums can be hold higher or making the lawyer to show reports to the bar or the insurance company about his professional acts in specific periods...|$|R

40|$|The passage above {{provides}} an apt image, {{with all its}} symbolic overtones, of Adam’s reaction to Eve’s mortal transgression—that is, her eating from the Forbidden Tree. The circular nature of the garland signifies perfection and permanence; the roses convey the delicacy, vitality, and bloom of life. The garland not only represents the perfection of a paradisal world, but the union between Adam and Eve. But Eve’s <b>careless</b> and wanton <b>act</b> shatters such a union. This leaves Adam with a choice: to eat the fruit thereby upholding his bond with and love for Eve (an act in defiance of God), or to walk away and shoulder the pangs of a broken heart {{and the prospect of}} a solitary future. He chooses the former. Many critics have argued—and will no doubt continue to argue—that slavish and blind passion prompted Adam to eat from the Tree. But this is not the case. Adam acts out of love. He sacrifices himself out of love, a sacrifice that parallels that of the Son (i. e. Jesus) in Book III of the epic...|$|R
6000|$|To one person, the damnation of {{this play}} {{seems to have}} afforded {{exquisite}} pleasure. This was Edward Ravenscroft, once {{a member of the}} Middle Temple,--an ingenious gentleman, of whose taste it may be held a satisfactory instance, that he deemed the tragedy of [...] "Titus Andronicus" [...] too mild for representation, and generously added a few more murders, rapes, and parricides, to that charnel-house of horrors[1]. His turn for comedy being at least equal to his success in the blood-stained buskin, Mr Ravenscroft translated and mangled several of the more farcical French comedies, which he decorated with the lustre of his own great name. Amongst others which he thus appropriated, were the most extravagant and buffoon scenes in Moliere's [...] "Bourgeois Gentilhomme;" [...] in which Monsieur Jourdain is, with much absurd ceremony, created a Turkish Paladin; and where Moliere took the opportunity to introduce an entrée de ballet, danced and sung by the Mufti, dervises, and others, in eastern habits.

40|$|Purpose: In {{the light}} of {{anthropogenic}} resource depletion and the resulting influences on the greenhouse effect as well as globally occurring famine, food waste has garnered increased public interest in recent years. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the environmental impacts of food waste and to determine to what extent consumers' behavior influences the environmental burden of food consumption in households. Methods: A life cycle assessment (LCA) study of three food products is conducted, following the ISO 14040 / 44 life cycle assessment guidelines. This study addresses the impact categories climate change (GWP 100), eutrophication (EP), and acidification (AP). Primary energy demand (PED) is also calculated. For adequate representation of consumer behavior, scenarios based on various consumer types are generated in the customer stage. The customer stage includes the food-related activities: shopping, storage, preparation, and disposal of food products as well as the disposal of the sales packaging. Results and discussion: If the consumer <b>acts</b> <b>careless</b> towards the environment, the customer stage appears as the main hotspot in the LCA of food products. The environmental impact of food products can be reduced in the customer stage by an environmentally conscious consumer. Shopping has the highest effect on the evaluated impact categories and the PED. Additionally, consumers can reduce the resulting emissions by decreasing the electric energy demand, particularly concerning food storage or preparation. Moreover, results show that the avoidance of wasting unconsumed food can reduce the environmental impact significantly. Conclusions: Results of this study show that the influence of consumer behavior on the LCA results is important. The customer stage of food products should not be overlooked in LCA studies. To enable comparison among results of other LCA studies, the LCA community needs to develop a common methodology for modeling consumer behavior...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives : Overhaul {{program is}} one of the sensitive, {{dangerous}} and extensive activities in petroleum industries. As a result of high rate of occupational accidents throughout this program, it is necessary to study the cause of accidents carefully. The current study as a descriptive-analytical was designed and conducted to evaluate the rate and cause of occupational accidents that were occurred throughout the overhaul program within ten years (2001 - 2010) in one of the petroleum industries Material and Methods : The occupational accidents data including demographic parameters (age, marital status), job experience, year of accident, affected organ, type and nature of injury and cause of accident were collected from workers’ medical records. The collected data were then analyzed by SPSS- 11 and descriptive statistics. Results : According to the results, about 23 occupational accidents were occurred in the-refinery during the last 10 years throughout the overhaul program. The majority of accidents (43. 5 %) was occurred in 2006, while the lowest was (4. 3 %) in 2002. The mean age of injured subjects was 30. 2 ± 11. 2 years. Most injured subjects (56. 5 %) were observed in age category of 21 - 30 years and less (13 %) in age category of 31 - 40 and over 50 years old. The most injured organs were lower parts of body (52. 2 %) and upper parts of body (47. 8 %) respectively. Main causes of accidents were reported as unsafe <b>acts</b> (<b>careless,</b> unsafe and lack of skill), while environmental conditions (slipperiness) caused a lowest number of accidents. Conclusion : In this study, unsafe acts were the most important factors of the occupational accidents. In order to reduce the occupational accidents throughout the program, job safety courses and trainings are essential to be held for workers. Moreover, applying comments of HSE staffs, precise supervision on accomplishment of the regulations, providing and using the proper personal protective equipment are helpful to prevent the occupational accidents...|$|R
