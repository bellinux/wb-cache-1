50|$|Since the {{establishment}} in 1996 {{of the first}} PA government approved by an elected Parliament, {{there had not been}} rules about the term of the Government. Ministers were just appointed and dismissed by President Arafat, whose own term was the <b>interim</b> <b>period</b> of the Oslo Accords. Also, the 2002 Basic Law itself only applied to the <b>interim</b> <b>period</b> as determined in the Oslo Accords. According to the Law, the Legislative Council (who should approve the Government) as well as the President of the Palestinian Authority (who should appoint the Ministers) were envisioned to remain in function {{until the end of the}} <b>interim</b> <b>period,</b> which had been ended on 5 July 1999. When Arafat on 29 May 2002 signed the 2002 Basic Law, the <b>interim</b> <b>period</b> had thus already been ended and the Government of June 2002 still not been appointed.|$|R

40|$|This Comment {{argues that}} the Declaration of Principles falls short of {{establishing}} a state of Palestine during the <b>interim</b> <b>period</b> provided for in the Declaration. However, this Comment presents {{the possibility that a}} state of Palestine will be established after the <b>interim</b> <b>period.</b> If a state of Palestine is established, it will have an effect on current United States law regarding Palestine and the PLO 2 ̆ 7 s sovereign immunity and standing to sue. The Declaration of Principles presents an opportunity to reevaluate the traditional view of Palestine. This Comment examines the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles and its effect on the changing legal status of Palestine. Although the provisions of the Declaration do provide steps toward establishing the requirements of statehood for Palestine, the Declaration does not establish a state of Palestine during the five-year <b>interim</b> <b>period</b> of autonomy. However, it is possible that a state of Palestine could exist after the <b>interim</b> <b>period...</b>|$|R
