25|$|On 22 May 2012, Ryan Richards {{announced}} that he was leaving the band. He cited his family as the reason, saying: “I’ve always put music first in my life – but the time has <b>come</b> <b>now</b> for my family to take the top spot”. It was the band's initial intention that Richards would not be replaced instantly and that the band would only look for a touring member to play for the band. However, it was announced on that Pat Lundy would be joining the band as Richards' replacement. Lundy is the former drummer of London-based heavy metal band Rise to Remain, having left the band in January 2012. After being contacted by the band to come to audition in Cardiff for the role, Pat learned their whole setlist in 7 days for the audition. Whilst the line up change occurred the band was recording and mixing their follow up to their fifth studio album. Across the year the band made few live appearances as they were working on the album, performing at Wakestock in North Wales, both the northern and southern dates of Slam Dunk Festival 2012 and the UK Warped Tour festival at the Alexandra Palace in London on 10 November 2012.|$|E
500|$|On July 30, 2010, the NBC network {{announced}} that {{an episode of}} 30 Rocks fifth season would be filmed and broadcast live on two occasions in the evening of October 14, 2010. The decision was made {{in part due to}} lagging ratings for all of NBC's Must-See TV line-up. The idea was originally conceived during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, when the cast performed two live versions of the season two episode [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] as a benefit at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. When asked by Entertainment Weekly the reason for doing a live episode, Fey said [...] " [...] was what made us {{think that it would be}} fun to do [...] And how far we've <b>come...</b> <b>Now</b> we're going to do it on TV." [...] In this same interview, Fey revealed that the episode would also be performed in front of a live audience. [...] "It will be exciting for us to do it for a live audience and see if we get live laughter." [...] Fey noted that the experience [...] "was so fun to feel the different timing of the show live and the audience response, which you just don't get in a single-camera show." [...] In another interview, Fey revealed that the staff have talked about doing a live show for years [...] "because we felt we had sort of interesting personnel for it." [...] Following the conclusion of the writers' strike they spoke to NBC about performing live and attempted to film it during the fourth season; however, they were unable to schedule it. For the fifth season, the writing staff began planning the live performance and waited until McCarthy-Miller—a recurring 30 Rock director—was available to helm it. Fey and Carlock said in separate discussions that another decision to do this episode of 30 Rock was based on the cast having theater and improvisation experience. Alec Baldwin had previously performed in the East and West live broadcasts of the Will & Grace [...] premiere episode, [...] "Alive and Schticking".|$|E

[...] However, an immediate ambiguity arises: in which coordinate system should these components be constant? ...|$|E
2500|$|During a talk in 1991, Schneerson spoke {{passionately about}} Moshiach (the Messiah) {{and told his}} {{followers}} {{that he had done}} all that he could to bring world peace and redemption, but that it was now up to them to continue this task: [...] "I have done my part, from now on you do all that you can." [...] A few months later, when a reporter from CNN came to meet him at dollars, he said, [...] "Moshiach is ready to <b>come</b> <b>now,</b> it is only on our part to do something additional in the realm of goodness and kindness." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} some {{criticism}} about the insistent tone of these words, {{on one occasion}} he explained [...] "This {{has always been the}} hope and yearning of the Jewish people – that the Messiah should <b>come</b> <b>now,</b> immediately. Therefore it is inappropriate for someone to say that he does not want, or that he does not agree, or that he is not comfortable that people are imploring 'we want moshiach now.' Each Jew clearly prays and pleads three times a day in the amida, while standing before the Al-mighty (at that time a person is certainly speaking the truth, and saying what he means) et tzemach davud avdecha me’hera tatzmiach , and then continues ki lishuatcha kivinu kol hayom, that he hopes for this the entire day!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{in a dispute}} between {{supporters}} of the adequacy of natural selection and those who held for inheritance of acquired characteristics, {{one of the arguments}} made repeatedly by Herbert Spencer, and followed by others, depended on what Spencer referred to as co-adaptation of co-operative parts, as in: [...] "We <b>come</b> <b>now</b> to Professor Weismann's endeavour to disprove my second thesis — {{that it is impossible to}} explain by natural selection alone the co-adaptation of co-operative parts. It is thirty years since this was set forth in [...] "The Principles of Biology." [...] In §166, I instanced the enormous horns of the extinct Irish elk, and contended that in this and in kindred cases, where for the efficient use of some one enlarged part many other parts have to be simultaneously enlarged, it is out of the question to suppose that they can have all spontaneously varied in the required proportions." ...|$|E
2500|$|By mid-September 1939, Freud's {{cancer of}} the jaw was causing him {{increasingly}} severe pain and had been declared to be inoperable. The last book he read, Balzac's La Peau de chagrin, prompted reflections on his own increasing frailty {{and a few days}} later he turned to his doctor, friend and fellow refugee, Max Schur, reminding him that they had previously discussed the terminal stages of his illness: [...] "Schur, you remember our 'contract' not to leave me in the lurch when the time had <b>come.</b> <b>Now</b> it is nothing but torture and makes no sense." [...] When Schur replied that he had not forgotten, Freud said, [...] "I thank you," [...] and then [...] "Talk it over with Anna, and if she thinks it's right, then make an end of it." [...] Anna Freud wanted to postpone her father's death, but Schur convinced her it was pointless to keep him alive and on 21 and 22 September administered doses of morphine that resulted in Freud's death around 3am on 23 September 1939. However, discrepancies in the various accounts Schur gave of his role in Freud's final hours, which have in turn led to inconsistencies between Freud's main biographers, has led to further research and a revised account. This proposes that Schur was absent from Freud's deathbed when a third and final dose of morphine was administered by Dr Josephine Stross, a colleague of Anna Freud's, leading to Freud's death around midnight on 23 September 1939.|$|E
2500|$|... “The [...] was mysterious for the Indians." [...] It {{was good}} when the Indians {{did not know}} the ways of the white man. It made the Indians like one family. Bad Indians could not become Hunka. It was not the white man’s way of teaching. Sometimes many Indians camped {{together}} to perform the ceremony. Then there were good times. This was usually in the summer time. The winter was not a good time for the ceremony, because food was not plenty during the winter. When many Indians gathered together for the ceremony, the old men counseled and the young men played games. The women provided plenty to eat. The children were happy and were never hungry. The young people made lover. Many sought a vision, and talked with the spirits. The good spirits attended such gatherings. The bad spirits also come. The Lakotas here practiced this ceremony for many years. It was not always the same. The shamans first learned how to perform it right. These shamans became Oglalas. The other Lakota learned how to perform it from the Oglalas. Other Indians are Hunkas, but they are not full Hunkas like the Oglalas. The young people do not become Hunka now. It is of no use to them. The old people do not pay attention to the Hunka now. The Hunka are not what they were in old times. Some old Indians could perform the ceremony right. An old Indian who wears the gee string and leggings could perform it. He might be afraid to talk like the Indians did before they lived on a reservation. It would not be right to teach the young Indians what was taught to the Hunka in old times. There are some secret things taught to a Hunka. These secrets are not good now. They are not about the spirits. The spirits will not <b>come</b> <b>now.</b> These are the spirits of the skies of the Earth, of the clouds, of the Thunder, of the land of pines, of the coming light of the sunset of the south, of the winds, of the waters, of flying things, of the beasts, of the insects, and of the spider. There are bad spirits also. There are ghosts and the man from the land of the pines. One spirit is stronger than another. One spirit is chief, and can influence all other spirits. These spirits come no more to the Indians of the reservation. It involved things that would not be allowed now. The Oglala did not think these things were wrong, but the white people do. For example a Hunka was taught how to steal horses and steal women from other Indians than Lakota.” “White men have their Bible and their Christ to guide them to the life to come. We Indians have our White Cow traditions and brave deeds. Let us wait, my friend, and see who gets there first.” ...|$|E
