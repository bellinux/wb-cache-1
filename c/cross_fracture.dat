40|$|Attention has {{recently}} {{been focused on the}} appearance of myofilaments in freeze-fractured and freeze-etched replicas (1, 2). From these studies it is apparent that cross fracturing of unfixed myofibrils always reveals thick (myosin) filaments as projections in both etched and unetched preparations. Furthermore, in an oblique <b>cross</b> <b>fracture,</b> there is a very striking change in appearance on crossing the M line: the broken-off ends of the myosin filaments extend above the fracture face to a much greater extent on one side (the M+ zone) than on the other (the M- zone) (1, 2, 3). It has been suggested that this difference, termed the M+/M- phenomenon (1), is dependent on the molecular polarity of the thick filaments (2). Usin...|$|E

All measured synthetic processes (DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and glycerol incorporation) were halted with either osmium tetroxide (OS) or glutaraldehyde fixation. That fewer mesosomes were seen in freeze fractures of unfixed cells was probably due to the difficulty of observing cross-fractured mesosomes in this organism in the unfixed state.

40|$|Models for {{the thermal}} and {{mechanical}} {{evolution of the}} oceanic lithosphere predict he progressive development of large thermal stresses in the thickening plate. However, there {{has so far been}} little direct evidence for the magnitude and distribution of thermal stresses. We present heoretical models which examine the effect of thermal stresses at fracture zones and show that an anomaly of the predicted form can be observed in geoid profiles which <b>cross</b> <b>fracture</b> zones. Specifically, our models predict he devel-opment of thermal bending moments which depend on lithosphere thickness or age and therefore change across fracture zones. Including the effect of varying thermal bending moments, thin plate theory predicts vertical, nonisostatic displacements of the lithosphere by plate flexure. The predicted amplitude of the resulting geoid anomaly is large enough to be observed in Seasat altimeter profiles. Furthermore, the general form of this anomaly differs ufficiently from other predicted components ofthe geoid anomaly at fracture zones to be discernable. The anomaly due to thermal stresses has been clearly identified in geoid profiles across the Clarion and the Udintsev fracture zones. The amplitude of this observed anomaly is well predicted if cooling lithosphere begins to accumulate lastic stresses at a temperature of 700 øC, consistent with the maximum depth of seismicity in the oceanic lithosphere. The distribution of thermal stresses with depth is also consistent with focal mechanisms of intraplate earthquakes...|$|E
40|$|This {{in vitro}} study aimed at {{substantial}} {{modification of the}} freeze-fracture replication technique (FFRT) which should result in an optimal visualization of the ultrastructure of human skin. The technique was modified in two ways: firstly, the conventional sample holders such as gold cups and copper plates were replaced by silver cylinders (8 3. 5 % silver, 16. 5 % copper) resulting in almost perpendicular <b>cross</b> <b>fractures</b> through the skin. Secondly, the replica cleaning procedure was optimized through the following sequence of treatments. Firstly, a mild tissue destruction was obtained by simultaneous lipid solvation and water extraction with absolute methanol (20 h), followed by protein denaturation with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 24 h). Subsequently, a final treatment was given using an alkaline sodium hypochlorite solution (20 % KOH/ 13 % NaC 10; 1 : 3 v/v, 4 d). After rinsing the replicas for 45 min in aqua bidest, they were mounted on copper grids and examined in the transmission electron microscope (TEM). The combination of the unorthodox fracturing method and the optimized cleaning procedure yielded large, practically undamaged and very clean replicas of near perpendicular <b>cross</b> <b>fractures</b> through human skin. Common handicaps related to current freeze-fracture procedures when applied to skin, such as incomplete cleaning and fragmentation of replicas and oblique or irregular fracturing planes, can largely be avoided in this way. In this paper a complete description of the method is given, {{and a number of}} advantages are illustrated with the aid of TEM micrographs...|$|R

During stage fracturing, the main hydraulic fractures are created one after another. When a main fracture is formed, there will exist an induced stress field around the fracture, which influences the in situ stress field around it.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{modeling}} of an induced hydraulic fracture and a natural fracture in a poroelastic medium and study their interaction. A finite element based numerical model is developed for this purpose. The model integrates a wellbore, an induced hydraulic fracture, a natural fracture and a reservoir in a fully coupled manner and simulates {{the interaction between}} induced hydraulic fracture and a natural fracture. A half reservoir model is used {{to take advantage of}} symmetry. In order to have control over the entire grid and element numbering, an innovative mesh generator was developed as part of this study. Fracture propagation is modeled based on KGD fracture mechanics. The numerical studies have shown that a natural fracture has a profound effect on the induced fracture propagation. It has been observed that in most cases the induced <b>fracture</b> <b>crosses</b> the natural <b>fracture</b> at high angles of approach and high differential stress. The width of the induced fracture decreases as it propagates. Once the induced <b>fracture</b> <b>crosses</b> a natural <b>fracture</b> and it propagates further into the formation fracture width increases. At low angles of approach and low differential stress the induced fracture {{is more likely to be}} arrested (at least short time) and/or breaks out from the far end side of the natural fracture. Results also showed that in the case of high angle of approach the hydraulic <b>fracture</b> always <b>crosses</b> the natural <b>fracture</b> and the differential stress has no significant effect on the propagation of hydraulic fracture. It has been also observed that propagation of induced fracture is stopped by a large (> 10 m) natural fracture at high angle of approach. If the injection rate, however, is increased the induced <b>fracture</b> <b>crosses</b> the large natural fracture at high angle of approach. At low angle of approach the induced fracture deviates and propagates along natural <b>fracture.</b> <b>Crossing</b> of natural <b>fracture</b> and/or arrest by the natural fracture is controlled by shear strength of the natural fracture, natural fracture orientation and in-situ stress state of the reservoir. From the results of this study it has been found that this model has a potential application in the design and optimization of hydraulic fracture treatments in naturally fractured reservoirs including tight gas reservoirs and enhanced geothermal systems. The model can also be used in the design of hydraulic stimulation of naturally fractured reservoirs based on shear dilation principle...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of a specialized terminal region in Mycoplasma pneumoniae was seen in thin sections viewed in an electron microscope. Actively growing cells were examined by the freeze-fracture technique {{in the absence of}} fixation to further establish the core as a significant structural entity. <b>Cross</b> <b>fractures</b> revealed a cytoplasmic matrix surrounding a central core structure of about 54 nm. This structure disappeared rapidly in aging cells. The convex protoplastic faces of the membrane around the core had characteristic 5 - to 10 -nm intramembrane particles evenly distributed across the cell surface, with no apparent difference in the region of the specialized tip. A periodicity previously noted in negatively stained preparations was clearly defined here in thin sections. Attachment of actively growing cells to sheep erythrocytes was seen primarily as a side attachment rather than attachment at the tip alone. This association between the mycoplasma and the sheep erythrocytes seriously deformed the sheep erythrocytes, but no membrane fusion could be detected...|$|R
40|$|A {{boundary}} element method (BEM) {{combined with}} a linear slip boundary condition is proposed to calculate SH wave scattering from fractures. The linear slip boundary condition was proposed by Schoenberg (1980) to model elastic wave propagation through an imperfectly bonded interface, where the traction cross the interface is continuous and displacement is discontinuous. Here, we demonstrate how to simulate SH wave scattering from fractures by applying the BEM and this linear slip boundary. Comparisons between results obtained using our model with those obtained using a computationally expensive finite difference method (FDM) (Coates and Schoenberg, 1995; Kruger et al., 2005) are performed to show the validity and accuracy of our approach. An example of SH wave scattering from three curved, <b>crossing</b> <b>fractures</b> is also given. Although our discussion here {{is focused on the}} linear slip boundary condition, our approach can easily be adopted to various slip boundary conditions that specify the displacement discontinuity and traction relations depending on different physical models of fractures.

40|$|Inter-observer {{agreement}} and reproducibility of opinion were assessed for the radiographic diagnosis of union of scaphoid fractures on films taken 12 weeks after injury. Weighted kappa statistics {{were used to}} compare the opinions of eight senior observers reviewing 20 sets of good quality radiographs on two occasions separated by two months. There was poor agreement on whether trabeculae <b>crossed</b> the <b>fracture</b> line, whether there was sclerosis at or near the fracture and on whether the proximal part of the scaphoid was avascular. As a consequence, agreement on union also was poor; it appears that radiographs taken 12 weeks after a scaphoid fracture do not provide reliable and reproducible evidence of healing. Fractures of the waist of the scaphoid are usually treated in plaster for 6 to 12 weeks. The decision to start mobilising the wrist is made at that time and is based on the absence of “significant ” tenderness in the ana-tomical snuff box (London 1961) and on radiographic “evidence ” of union.

40|$|The {{structure}} of membranes at junctions between the plasma membrane and underlying cisterns of endoplasmic reticulum in amphioxus muscle and mouse cerebellar neurons was studied using the freeze-fracture technique. In amphioxus muscle, subsurface cisterns of sarcoplasmic reticulum form junctions with the surface membrane {{at the level}} of the sarcomere I bands. On the protoplasmic leaflet of the sarcolemma overlying these junctions were aggregates of large particles. On the protoplasmic leaflet of the membranes of cerebellar basket, stellate and Purkinie cells there were similar aggregates of large particles. In both tissues, the corresponding external membrane halves had arrays of pits apparently complementary to the aggregates of large particles. <b>Cross</b> <b>fractures</b> through junctions showed that the particle aggregates in neuronal and muscle membranes were consistently located over intracellular cisterns closely applied to the plasma membrane. Thus, a similar plasma membrane specialization is found at subsurface cisterns in mammalian neurons and amphioxus muscle.

Longitudinal fractures through the axostyle at various orientations demonstrate a minimum longitudinal periodicity of 160 A for both the spacing of the globular subunits within the microtubule wall and the spacing of the intrarow bridges.

In this field trial, the time spent to unblock a borehole varied between 18. 52 and 34. 98 min, which is much shorter than using a drilling rig.

Without etching, <b>cross</b> <b>fractures</b> rarely reveal the 9 + 2 pattern, although suggestions of ninefold symmetry are present. In etched preparations, longitudinal fractures through the matrix show a triplet spoke alignment corresponding to the spoke periodicity seen in thin sections. Dynein rows can be visualized along the peripheral microtubules in some preparations. Fracture faces of the ciliary membrane are smooth with few membrane particles, except in the regions adjacent to the basal plate. In the transition region below the plate, a unique particle arrangement, the ciliary necklace, is found. In the Elliptio gill, on fracture face A the necklace is comprised of three well-defined rows or strands of membrane particles that encircle the ciliary shaft. The rows are scalloped and each scallop corresponds to a peripheral doublet microtubule. In thin sections {{at the level of}} these particles, a series of champagne-glass structures link the microtubular doublets to the ciliary membrane.

40|$|Sealing of tunnels by {{grouting}} demands knowledge {{concerning the}} fractured rock and the grout, {{followed by an}} appropriate choice of strategy and equipment. In this thesis, the characterisation of rock is the main issue and, since it addresses the engineering problem of producing a description for grouting, the properties of grout and the grouting procedure need to be considered. The conceptualisation {{is based on a}} grouting fan with a number of boreholes that <b>cross</b> <b>fractures</b> of different lengths and orientations and with varying ability to transmit water. These parameters are used to form a simplified model, in which discrete fractures and fractures along boreholes are considered central for further investigations. The ability to transmit water, or the transmissivity of the fractures, is a key parameter since it reflects the fracture aperture, an aperture that will influence both the penetration length and the volume of grout. Transmissivity, orientation and length of fractures are obtained by means of hydraulic tests and geological mapping. The question asked is whether these methods are useful and robust enough for grouting predictions. Investigations of geometry for a discrete fracture were performed using analytical and numerical approaches followed by laboratory and field experiments. For a larger scale and fractures along boreholes, a compilation of field data was made followed by the development of a non-parametric method, which gives a possible transmissivity distribution for <b>fractures</b> <b>crossing</b> a borehole. According to these investigations, the transmissivity or a closely related and more easily obtained parameter, referred to as the specific capacity, gives a good description of the fracture aperture. Furthermore, the median specific capacity of a small number of tests described the fracture in general, i. e. the effective or cross-fracture transmissivity. Probe holes have proved useful as a basis for choosing a grouting strategy and, here, the non-parametric method resulted in a low frequency of conductive fractures with log-normal distributed transmissivities. These parameters were used to analyse data from individual boreholes, which were subsequently connected to form a simplified model. The methodology was verified with a field experiment and should be useful in a grouting project...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{presence}} of fractures on fluid flow in reservoir is nowadays a fundamental theme of interest to the oil industry. In the case of carbonate rocks, the study of the contribution of fractures on reservoir efficiency becomes more complex due to the reactive nature of these rocks to circulating fluid and the high tendency to form karst. The fractures act as agents that focus fluid percolation and exert structural control on the formation of karst. For the oil industry, this scenario can be favorable became of the increasing of porosity and permeability of secondary fractures, but also poses risks to the operation. This article investigates, under the geomechanical point of view, how the presence of fractures influence the development of karst observed in carbonate rocks. The Jandaíra Formation was selected as an analogue geomaterial to fractured carbonate reservoirs in marginal basins of Brazil. The methodology adopted for this study included: (i) the use of satellite images, an UAV; (ii) Numeral modeling of the {{effect of the}} current tensions on the flagstone structures. Comparing the results of numerical modeling to the mapping performed on the images, {{it was found that the}} regions of the numerical models where the highest values of dilatancy occur coincided with local areas in the field (fault terminations and <b>cross</b> <b>fractures),</b> which represent the concentration of dissolution and karst formation.

Additional sets of conjugate shear fractures have been recognized in outcrops of Dakota strata and may {{be present in the}} subsurface. However, the deformation bands prevalent locally in outcrops in parts of the basin as yet have no documented subsurface equivalent. The immature Mesaverde sandstones typically contain relatively long, irregular extension fractures, whereas the quartzitic Dakota sandstones contain short, sub-parallel, closely spaced, extension fractures, and locally conjugate shear planes as well. Outcrops typically display secondary <b>cross</b> <b>fractures</b> which are rare in the subsurface, although oblique fractures associated with local structures such as the Hogback monocline may be present in similar subsurface structures. Spacings of the bed-normal extension fractures are approximately equal to or less than the thicknesses of the beds in which they formed, in both outcrop and subsurface. Fracture intensities increase in association with faults, where there is a gradation from intense fracturing into fault breccia. Bioturbation and minimal cementation locally inhibited fracture development in both formations, and the vertical limits of fracture growth are typically at bedding/lithology contrasts. Fracture mineralizations have been largely dissolved or replaced in outcrops, but local examples of preserved mineralization show that the quartz and calcite common to subsurface fractures were originally present in outcrop fractures.

30|$|The optimal pin {{configuration}} {{is a subject}} of considerable debate in relation to ulnar nerve injury and biomechanical principles [3]. Randomized clinical trials have shown that lateral-entry pin fixation and crossed-{{pin configuration}} are equally effective {{in the treatment of}} displaced supracondylar fractures [21, 22]. However, the risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury following percutaneous fixation using a crossed-pin technique has been well documented [8, 9, 10]. Many authors have concluded that fixation with lateral pins is a safer and more effective method for displaced supracondylar fractures in children [11, 23, 24, 25]. Studies have also demonstrated that the site of pin insertion is less important for fracture stability than the site at which the pins <b>cross</b> the <b>fracture</b> [5, 26, 27]. Kallio et al. [28], who focused on optimal lateral pin placement technique, recommended divergent pin placement for maximum stability and avoidance of joint penetration. In a biomechanical comparison of all three configurations, Lee et al. [29] reported that divergent lateral pin configuration provided greater stability than parallel pin configuration, and demonstrated similar stability compared with crossed-pin configuration. This was confirmed by another biomechanical study showing that the best torsional, valgus, and extension resistance are associated with the most divergent configuration of the lateral pins, in which the diverging pin <b>crosses</b> the <b>fracture</b> site at the medial edge of the coronoid fossa [30]. Based on the results of our cadaveric study, parallel lateral pin configuration may increase the risk of intracapsular pin placement compared to divergent lateral pin configuration. Thus, of the three configurations, divergent lateral pin placement is most desirable, since it has less potential for nerve injury, ensures optimal fracture stability, and in addition reduces the risk of intracapsular pin placement.|$|R

In specimen 2 #, the coal block had a relatively complete structure and no obvious cracks were observed in the surface. Under high injection conditions (30  mL/min), the hydraulic <b>fracture</b> <b>crossed</b> the layer interface and connected the neighboring layers. In addition, due to the low strength and brittleness of coal, rock collapse occurred near the wellbore, and the main fracture surface was rough.|$|R
