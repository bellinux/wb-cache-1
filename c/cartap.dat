40|$|Our {{previous}} study {{has demonstrated that}} instead of neuromuscular blockage <b>cartap,</b> an orgationitrogen insecticide, could cause a marked irreversible Ca 2 +-dependent contracture in both isolated mouse and rabbit phrenic nerve-diaphragms. We further examined the potential of direct myocytotoxicity of <b>cartap</b> and the possible roles of calcium ion and oxidative stress on cartap-induced muscle cell injury using the mouse myoblast cell line, C 2 C 12. <b>Cartap</b> exerted a dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effect in C 2 C 12 cells measured by MTT colorimetric assay and trypan blue dye exclusion. The extracellular activities of both creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were elevated in the cartap-treated groups at or greater than 100 mu M. The isoenzymatic profiles showed that the elevations were mainly due to CK- 3, LDH- 3, and LDH- 4, Following the addition of 0. 5 - 2. 5 mM EGTA, a Ca 2 + chelator, or 30 - 100 mu M verapamil, an L-type Ca 2 + channel blocker, the cartap-induced reduction in MTT metabolic rate of C 2 C 12 cells was significantly restored in a dose-dependent manner in both EGTA and verapamil-treated cells. Furthermore, EGTA could significantly reduce the cartap-induced elevation in the levels of total extracellular CK and LDH activities. Additionally, <b>cartap</b> significantly increased the level of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in C 2 C 12 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The cartap-induced ROS generation could be significantly inhibited by antioxidants, including Vitamins C and E, catalase, and superoxide dismutase, with catalase the most effective. EGTA could significantly inhibit cartap-induced ROS generation in a dose-dependent manner. The results suggested that <b>cartap</b> could induce ROS generation in C 2 C 12 cells via a Ca 2 +-dependant mechanism resulting in subsequent cytotoxicity, at least partially, to C 2 C 12 cells. It is speculated that both Ca 2 + and Ca 2 +-induced ROS may also play the central role on the myogenic contracture and myofiber injury of the diaphragm leading to respiratory failure and subsequent death in rabbits exposed ocularly to <b>cartap.</b> (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|The {{transport}} {{parameters of}} soluble chemicals through soils {{are needed to}} assess the pollution risks of soil and groundwater resources. The transport parameters of seven heavy metal/metalloid compounds (NaAsO 2, Cd(NO 3) 2, Pb(NO 3) 2, Ni(NO 3) 2, ZnCl 2, CuSO 4 and Co(NO 3) 2), two pesticides (<b>cartap</b> and carbendazim) and an inert salt (CaCl 2) were determined in repacked columns of eight agricultural soils of Bangladesh. The relation between the physico-chemical properties of the soils and solutes, and the solute-transport parameters were investigated by TDR using bulk soil electrical conductivity (EC) as a proxy. The transport velocity, V, of the solutes decreased, linearly, with the increasing clay content of the soils. Of the nine reactive solutes, <b>cartap</b> and As moved with the largest velocity and smallest velocity, respectively. Dispersivity of the solutes, Î», decreased with increasing clay content linearly but following power law with increasing median grain diameter of the soils. It also increased significantly (p = 0. 05) with the increasing length of travel path. Solute retardation factor, R, increased with increasing clay content following power law, implying that clay content is a determining factor for heavy metal retention in soils. R increased non-linearly with increasing travel length except for cadmium, for which the increase was linear. R decreased with increasing water flux and revealed non-equilibrium transport process of the solutes. Based on R, the general adsorption affinity of the solutes in the soils was: As > Co > Cd >carbendazim>Pb> Cu >cartap> Zn > Ni > Ca. In some soils, however, Cd and carbendazim showed a lower adsorption compared to Pb and Co, and Zn and <b>cartap</b> were more strongly adsorbed than Ni. The relationships between physico-chemical properties of the soils and solutes, and the solute-transport parameters, obtained in this study, contribute to the better interpretation of TDR data as a preliminary assessment of pollutant mobility in soils with different textures.

Em relação à diversidade em diferentes cultivares de cafeeiro (Coffea canephora cv Apoatã e de C. arabica cultivares Mundo Novo, Icatu Vermelho, Icatu Amarelo e Catuaí Amarelo) realizado em Garça, verificou-se que a maior riqueza de espécies e o maior número de indivíduos na superfície das folhas foram observados para Apoatã. A cultivar Icatu Vermelho foi a que apresentou maior uniformidade na distribuição das espécies de ácaros e Apoatã a que apresentou menor uniformidade. Em relação à preferência hospedeira, B. phoenicis foi encontrado em maior abundância na cultivar Apoatã, representando 61 % de todos os indivíduos. E. citrifolius ocorreu em maior número na cultivar Mundo Novo e E. concordis na Apoatã. A. brasiliensis ocorreu em maior quantidade na cultivar Icatu Vermelho e Z. malvinae ocorreu sem diferença estatística em todas as cultivares. Em relação aos efeitos de pesticidas sobre a diversidade de ácaros, constatou-se que no tratamento com triadimenol + disulfoton apresentou a menor, enquanto que no deltametrina + triazophos a maior. B. phoenicis apresentou redução no número de indivíduos no tratamento com aldicarb e um aumento de cerca de duas vezes nos tratamentos com triadimenol + disulfoton e no thiamethoxam. Os tratamentos que apresentaram as maiores semelhanças na composição das espécies foram: testemunha e <b>cartap,</b> e thiamethoxam e ethion; e os tratamentos de menor similiaridade foram: testemunha e aldicarb, aldicarb e <b>cartap,</b> e aldicarb e deltametrina + triazophos. Reduções significativas na população de A. brasiliensis nos tratamentos com aldicarb e thiamethoxam e de E. citrifolius no tratamento com <b>cartap</b> foram detectadas. The {{knowledge on}} the interactions among Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes), other phytophagous or predaceous mites and coffee plants is still insufficient {{to establish an}} adequate management program for this crop, {{in order to minimize}} the problems caused by coffee ringspot virus (CoRSV), transmitted by B. phoenicis. In spite of the problem, little is known on the diversity of mites, {{as well as on the}} population dynamics of B. phoenicis and its natural enemies on coffee plants of several important commercial cultivars. Information on the impact of agrochemicals on the population of mites on coffee plantations are practically inexistent. However, it is known that some insecticides and fungicides can affect the population of predaceous mites inducing pest mite population increases. Characterizing the diversity of mites on two important coffee-producing areas of the state of São Paulo (Jeriquara and Garça), it was observed that the diversity of mites was higher in Jeriquara county than in Garça. A total of 13, 052 mites was collected in both studied areas, of which 7, 155 in Jeriquara and 5, 897 in Garça. Of the total of 108 species identified in this study, 45 species were observed in both localities (Garça an Jeriquara), which presented 56 % of similarity. The most frequent predaceous mites on leaves were Euseius concordis (Chant), E. citrifolius Denmark & Muma and Agistemus brasiliensis Matioli, Ueckermann & Oliveira, among others. The study on the diversity of mites in different coffee cultivars (Coffea canephora cv. Apoatã and C. arabica cv. Mundo Novo, Icatu Vermelho, Icatu Amarelo and Catuai Amarelo), carried out in Garça, showed the highest species richness and the highest number of specimens for the leaf surface of Apoatã. Icatu Vermelho was the cultivar which presented the highest uniformity of distribution of mite species and Apoatã was the cultivar with the lowest uniformity. The species B. phoenicis was found in higher abundance in Apoatã, representing 61 % of all specimens collected. E. citrifolius occurred in higher number on the cultivar Mundo Novo and E. concordis in Apoatã. The stigmaeid mite A. brasiliensis occurred in higher number on the cultivar Icatu Vermelho and Z. malvinae was present in similar populations on all coffee cultivars. The study on the effect of pesticides on the mite diversity, showed the lowest diversity for the treatment with triadimenol + dissulfoton, and the highest diversity was observed for treatment with deltamethrin + triazophos. B. phoenicis presented population reduction for the treatments aldicarb, but an increase of around two times for treatments with triadimenol + disulfoton and with thiamethoxam. The treatments with the highest similarities in species composition were: <b>cartap</b> and control (without pesticide), and thiamethoxam and ethion; and the treatments with the lowest similarities were: control and aldicarb, aldicarb and <b>cartap,</b> and aldicarb and deltamethrin + triazophos.

40|$|An {{extensive}} experimental {{investigation has}} been carried out i) to isolate and identify a potential microbial strain from soil which can biodegrade pesticides, typically present in wastewater from the sources of industrial and agricultural related activities, ii) to study the growth potential of microbial isolate in the presence of Malathion, Methamadiophos, <b>Cartap</b> and Cypermethrin iii) to assess the performance of microbial isolate for Cypermethrin degradation in wastewater using pilot activated sludge process (biosimulator) iii) to study the effects of different parameters (pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen) on the biodegradability of the potential strain for Cypermethrin iv) further statistical assessment of the performance efficiency of the system with the help of principal component analysis and regression models. During the investigation, two sets of experiments were conducted. In the first set of experiments, attempts were made to isolate soil borne strains, potential candidates capable of biodegrading pesticides. In the second set of experiments, the effects of parameters on the biodegradability of the isolated strains for the Cypermethrin, were investigated. Experiments were designed and performed {{in such a way as}} to study the effects of parameters like Cypermethrin concentrations, retention time, temperature, pH, mechanism of aeration, and the amount of Dissolved Oxygen (DO), on the degree of biodegradation of Cypermethrin (in terms of the removal of COD and Cypermethrin). Following were the ranges of the above mentioned parameters investigated during the experiments. Concentration ofCypem 1 ethrin: 40 - 125 mg/l Retention Time: 24, 48 and 72 hours Temperatures: ambient temperature (18 - 25 Â°C), 28 - 30 Â°C, and 38 - 40 Â°C pH: 7. 3 - 8. 8 Mechanism of aeration: diffused and mechanical aeration at 180 and 250 rpm Amount of dissolved oxygen: 5 - 12 mg/L For growth kinetic studies, a number of batch experiments were carried out in conical flasks (without shaking) in the presence of different concentration of pesticides such as: Malathion, Methamadiophos, <b>Cartap</b> and Cypermethrin. In order to perform the parametric sensitivity study, as mentioned above, biodegradation experiments were performed on small scale in 250 ml flask, using shaking water bath, and on large scale in â€œBiosimulatorâ€� (borosilicate glass of 20 L capacity). In the Biosimulator, the operating conditions of a typical â€œActivated Sludgeâ€� process was simulated. The data, obtained from parametric sensitivity experiments, are employed to develop â€œRegression Modelsâ€� in order to study the effects of parameters, statistically, on the removal of COD and Cypermethrin. Cypermethrin pesticide was selected for the detailed investigation because its low aqueous solubility, such toxic compounds are very difficult to be removed from the environmental systems by conventional means. Information obtained from this study may be helpful in designing and operating an efficient pollution control treatment system. A particular problem, which is being faced by the environmental engineers, is the difficulty in predicting the performance of these systems with respect to high load of individual organic compounds. This has led to difficulty in predicting effluent concentrations by traditional models. An effective pesticide waste treatment technology is therefore needed to prevent water pollution and to comply with increasing regulatory pressures. Following are the main findings from the present extensive investigation: 1. Using the enrichment technique, a soil borne strain Pseudomollas designated as IES-Ps-l was isolated some time back at the Institute of Environmental Studies, University of Karachi. In the present study IES-Ps-l was allowed to adapt in the presence of Cypermethrin. Adapted IES-Ps-l strain was identified by microscopic examination and confirmed by biochemical tests. 2. During growth studies, IES-Ps-l strain was found to grow in a wide range of concentrations of Malathion (35 - 220 mg/L), Methamidophos (80 - 320 mg/L), <b>Cartap</b> (60 - 120 mg/L) and Cypermethrin (40 - 180 mg/L). However, the optimum concentration of each pesticide which support the growth of IES-Ps-l during 24 hours incubation period (experiments without shaking) was 120 mg/L of Malathion, 160 mg/L of Methamidophos, 80 mg/L of <b>Cartap</b> and 60 mg/L of Cypermethrin. 3. When compared with the control test (without pesticide), a significant increase in bacterial population was observed at low concentration of each pesticide, however at high concentration lag phase markedly increased but no zone of inhibition observed. 4. Tolerance to much higher concentration of Cypermethrin was obtained through enrichment. Even at 180 mg/L of Cypermethrin dose, the toxic effect did not appear, but the growth rate significantly decreased. 5. Experiments, carried out on shaking water bath, showed about 22...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Four {{insecticides}} {{were tested}} for their suitability to an {{integrated pest management}} program of woolly apple aphid (WAA). The tested insecticides were imidacloprid, pirimicarb, <b>cartap</b> and petroleum oil. Three indices were developed to determine the degree of selectivity of studied insecticides and to determine their suitability to WAA IPM program. WAA index {{used to measure the}} efficacy of the insecticides against the WAA and showed that imidacloprid was the most efficient in suppressing WAA. Parasitoid index used to measure the negative impact of insecticides on the sole parasitoid of WAA, Aphelinus mali. This index indicated that pirimicarb was the safest insecticide to WAA parasitoid, while imidacloprid caused drastic effect on mummified aphids. Both the WAA and parasitoid indices were integrated in a selectivity index that was used to determine the IPM compatibility of the tested insecticides. Selectivity index indicated that pirimicarb is the most suitable insecticide for controlling WAA as its application resulted in valuable suppression of WAA and very low negative impact to its parasitoid.

This study assessed the lethal and sublethal effects of insecticides on this species through life table, and classified the insecticides according to the definitions of toxicity given by the International Organization for Biological and Integrated Control of Noxious Animals and Plants (IOBC). A bioassay was carried out using a completely randomized design with eight treatments and 40 replicates. Eggs of O. insidiosus laid naturally in plant stems were immersed in aqueous solutions of the chemical products. Egg viability, duration of the embryonic period, survival of nymphs, and duration of the nymphal period were assessed daily. Insects that reached adulthood were paired and their reproduction assessed. The number of eggs produced and the survival of adults were assessed daily.

40|$|Root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita is {{the most}} {{widespread}} and destructive pathogen of tomato as {{it is difficult to}} control due to its wide host range. Management strategies for root knot nematodes mainly rely on chemicals/nematicides because of limited availability of resistant cultivars. The present investigation was planned to exploit the nematicidal potential of bio and synthetic chemicals against M. incognita on tomato. The effect of twenty chemicals currently available in the market was evaluated against M. incognita. Hatching inhibition and juvenile's mortality of M. incognita was assessed under in vitro conditions. Four concentrations of each chemical were prepared viz., 2 S, S, S/ 2 and S/ 4 according to recommended dose of each chemical. Data on hatching inhibition were recorded after 2, 4 and 6 days and on mortality after 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours of incubation. Maximum hatching inhibition and mortality percentage was recorded in synthetic (<b>Cartap,</b> Virtako) and bio (Cure, Azadirachtin) chemicals. These four chemicals were selected and evaluated further against mobility of juveniles and for their phytotoxic effect on tomato. The minimum number of J 2 s was recovered in <b>Cartap</b> followed by other chemicals while the maximum was recovered in control. Tomato plants were examined for yellowing or browning, wilting, necrosis, burning and plant mortality for up to two weeks; none of the chemical was found to be phytotoxic. Efficiency of selected chemicals was evaluated at different time intervals viz., 7, 14 and 28 days against M. incognita on nematode reproduction parameters. A gradual decline was noted in the effectiveness of chemicals with the increase in time interval. Galling index was increased in all the chemicals after 28 days interval as compared to 7 and 14 days. Selected chemicals significantly reduced invasion and subsequent development of nematodes in roots. Protective application of selected bio and synthetic chemicals was more effective at nematode suppression rather than being curative. Systemic effect of chemicals was determined through split root technique. Selected chemicals showed systemic activity in terms of lesser number of egg masses, females and eggs/egg mass in the untreated root portion. Selected chemicals were tested as soil drench and root dip treatment against M. incognita. Results revealed that soil drench treatment was more effective in reducing nematode population than root dip treatment. Combined application of selected chemicals with fertilizers not only reduced nematode reproduction but also improved plant growth. Significant suppression in nematode population was observed in all the selected chemicals when applied in infested microplots. The results of present investigation suggest suitable chemicals for growers having a nematode problem in their fields to incorporate it in management strategies...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Information on the {{insecticide}} susceptibility of striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Walker), {{is essential}} for an effective pest management programme. An early detection of resistance development can prompt the modification of current control methods and increase the lifespan of insecticides through the rotation of chemicals with different modes of action. In this study, the susceptibility of this pest in Taiwan to four classes of insecticides has been examined. RESULTS: Over 1000 -fold resistance to carbofuran was detected in C. suppressalis collected from Chiayi and Changhua prefectures, with estimated LC(50) values of > 3 mg cm(- 2). In addition, 61 -fold resistance to <b>cartap</b> {{was found in the}} Chiayi population. On the other hand, all tested populations of rice stem borer were still relatively susceptible to chlorpyrifos, fipronil and permethrin, with LC(50) values ranging from 30 to 553 ng cm(- 2). Chilo suppressalis populations collected from the central parts of Taiwan have a higher degree of resistance to the tested insecticides than those from northern areas. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of high resistance to carbofuran in the Chiayi and Changhua areas suggests that this compound should be replaced with chemicals having a different mode of action, such as chlorpyrifos, fipronil and permethrin, to which low cross-resistance has been detected.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the spray deposition on leaves of coffee plants and the chemical control of the leaf miner provided by the application of different spray nozzles, with and without the use of an auxiliary boom. The deposition on the upper, middle and lower parts of the plants and the losses to the soil were evaluated using a tracer quantified by spectrophotometer. We also evaluated the chemical control of the leaf miner, counting the larvae, after the application of the insecticides <b>cartap</b> and fenpropathrin. The trial was carried out in a randomized block design, with four replications, in a factorial model (2 × 2 + 1) : with and without the auxiliary boom, three spray nozzles (hollow cone &# 8211; MAG 02, flat fan &# 8211; AD 11002 and air induction hollow cone &# 8211; TVI 8002) and a control. The use of the auxiliary boom increased the deposition in the lower part of the plants but decreased in the middle part, besides the increase in the runoff. The different nozzles do not provided differences in the deposition, showing the technical feasibility in the use of the hollow cone nozzles with coarse droplets and flat fan.

The proposed method {{can handle the}} intrinsic interferences of herbal samples; satisfactory average recoveries attained from near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) PLSR models were 99. 0 ± 10. 8 and 100. 2 ± 1. 0 % for Ca, 100. 2 ± 6. 9 and 99. 7 ± 2. 5 % for Th, and 99. 1 ± 6. 3 and 99. 6 ± 1. 0 % for Te, respectively. Furthermore, some statistical parameters and figures of merit are fully investigated to evaluate {{the performance of the}} two models. It was found that both models could give accurate results and only the performance of MIR-PLSR was slightly better than that of NIR-PLSR in the cases suffering from herbal matrix interferences. In conclusion, FT-IR spectroscopy in combination with PLSR has been demonstrated for its application in rapid screening and quantitative analysis of multipesticide residues in Chinese herbal medicines without physical or chemical separation pretreatment step and any spectral processing, which also implies other potential applications such as food and drug safety, herbal plants quality, and environmental evaluation, due to its advantages of nontoxic and nondestructive analysis...|$|E
40|$|The fish embryo {{toxicity}} test (FET) is currently {{one of the}} most advocated animal alternative tests in ecotoxicology. To date, the application of the FET with zebrafish zFET has focused on acute toxicity assessment, where only lethal morphological effects are accounted for. An application of the zFET beyond acute toxicity, however, necessitates the establishment of more refined and quantifiable toxicological endpoints. A valuable tool in this context is the use of gene expression-dependent fluorescent markers that can even be measured in-vivo. We investigated the application of embryos of Tg(fli 1 :EGFP) y 1 for the identification of vasotoxic substances within the zFET. Tg(fli 1 :EGFP) y 1 fish express enhanced GFP in the entire vasculature {{under the control of the}} fli 1 promoter, and thus enable the visualisation of vascular defects in live zebrafish embryos. We assessed the fli 1 driven EGFP-expression in the intersegmental blood vessels (ISVs) qualitatively and quantitatively, and found an exposure concentration related increase in vascular damage for chemicals like triclosan, <b>cartap</b> and genistein. The fluorescence endpoint ISV-length allowed an earlier and more sensitive detection of vasotoxins than the bright field assessment method. In combination with the standard bright field morphological effect assessment, an increase in significance and value of the zFET for a mechanism-specific toxicity evaluation was achieved.

In recent times, use {{of pesticide}}s in rice farming has increased rapidly and this scenario contributes significantly towards adverse effects on human health and environment. This study investigated types of pesticide and identified their hazards and potential risks used by rice farmers {{in the village of}} Permatang Keriang, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia. Pesticide use, pesticide formulation, groups, classes, major pests as well as pesticide risks and toxicity were examined. Forty selected rice farmers which represent 33 % of the total rice farmer population were interviewed based on 40 questions. From the survey, eight pesticide formulations including Actara (85 %), Karate (93 %), Nurelle 505 (73 %), Nominee 100 SC (83 %), Tapisan (65 %) and Yasodion (62 %) were found commonly used by the farmers in rice farming activities to control several major pests including plant diseases, fungi, insects and rodents. Major active ingredients of the pesticides found in this study were cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, lambda-cyhalothrin, difenoconazole, bispyribac-sodium, isoprothiolane and <b>cartap</b> hydrochloride. From the study, it was observed that both high and low toxicity pesticides were used.

40|$|Rodents {{are widely}} {{used to test the}} {{developmental}} neurotoxicity potential of chemical substances. The regulatory test procedures are elaborate and the requirement of numerous animals is ethically disputable. Therefore, non-animal alternatives are highly desirable, but appropriate test systems that meet regulatory demands are not yet available. Hence, we have developed a new developmental neurotoxicity assay based on specific whole-mount immunostainings of primary and secondary motor neurons (using the monoclonal antibodies znp 1 and zn 8) in zebrafish embryos. By classifying the motor neuron defects, we evaluated the severity of the neurotoxic damage to individual primary and secondary motor neurons caused by chemical exposure and determined the corresponding effect concentration values (EC 50). In a proof-of-principle study, we investigated the effects of three model compounds thiocyclam, <b>cartap</b> and disulfiram, which show some neurotoxicity-indicating effects in vertebrates, and the positive controls ethanol and nicotine and the negative controls 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (3, 4 -DCA) and triclosan. As a quantitative measure of the neurotoxic potential of the test compounds, we calculated the ratios of the EC 50 values for motor neuron defects and the cumulative malformations, as determined in a zebrafish embryo toxicity test (zFET). Based on this index, disulfiram was classified as the most potent and thiocyclam as the least potent developmental neurotoxin. The index also confirmed the control compounds as positive and negative neurotoxicants. Our findings demonstrate that this index can be used to reliably distinguish between neurotoxic and non-neurotoxic chemicals and provide a sound estimate for the neurodevelopmental hazard potential of a chemical.

40|$|Rice is {{the main}} crop of Taiwan. Although the {{cultivated}} areas of rice decreased gradually in recent years, it is still very important for rice pest control. There are three major stem borers in Taiwan which cause dead heart and white head of rice. They are Sesamia inferens (Walker) of Noctuidae, Chilo suppressalis (Walker) and Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker) of Pyralidae. During the past two years, the distribution of rice stem borers {{in the first and}} the secondary crops from Tainan, Chiayi, Changhua, Taichung, Miaoli, Hsinchu and Taoyuan of Taiwan was surveyed in our laboratory. Increase of S. inferens number in central and southern counties was observed and this situation is getting obvious over each cropping period. The lack of chemical controlling data to S. inferens had urged us to understand the susceptibility of S. inferens to insecticides used for C. suppressalis control. Chlorpyrifos, carbofuran, <b>cartap,</b> permethrin, and spinosad belonging to three modes of action were evaluated. The results showed that S. inferens in Chiayi has developed 17 -fold resistance against spinosad. Although {{there was no significant difference}} in susceptibility among S. inferens populations to other tested insecticides, differential susceptibilities of chlorpyrifos and carbofuran were observed in S. inferens and C. suppressalis which share the same habitat. Carbofuran, which had lost its activity on the C. suppressalis of Changhua and Chiayi, still possessed more than 1000 -fold activity on all tested populations of S. inferens. On the contrary, chlorpyrifos which was highly toxic to C. suppressalis took much higher dosage (200 ~ 600 -fold) to control S. inferens. The enzyme kinetic assays of S. inferens and C. suppressalis acetylcholinesterases (AChE) showed that an increasing in Km of S. inferens AChE and variations in inhibition patterns of carbofuran and chlorpyrifos oxon on S. inferens and C. suppressalis AChE might result in differential susceptibilities of both stem borers to chlorpyrifos and carbofuran. 水稻是台灣最主要的糧食作物，雖然近年來的耕種面積逐漸減少，但是防治水稻害蟲仍然相當重要。在台灣會造成水稻枯心或是白穗的蛀心蟲主要有三種，分別為屬於夜蛾科的大螟(Sesamia inferens (Walker)) ，以及屬於螟蛾科的二化螟(Chilo suppressalis (Walker)) 和三化螟(Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker)) 。根據本實驗室近兩年來，由南往北對台南、嘉義、彰化、台中、苗栗、新竹、桃園等地之一、二期水稻進行採集調查的結果發現，大螟在中南部地區發生數量增加，有日趨嚴重的現象。由於目前在水稻針對大螟的防治資料並不多，因此本實驗是以陶斯松、加保扶、培丹、百滅寧、賜諾殺等三種不同作用機制的五種常用藥劑，對各地區的大螟進行藥劑測試，以瞭解大螟目前對常用藥劑的感受性。結果顯示，除了嘉義地區大螟對於賜諾殺有較高的抗性比之外，其他各地區大螟對藥劑的感受性差異並不多。然而在比較相同地區大螟及二化螟對藥劑的感受性時，發現二者對陶斯松與加保扶的感受性不同。加保扶對彰化、嘉義的二化螟幾乎沒有防治效果，對大螟仍然有效。對二化螟的防治效果極佳的陶斯松，對大螟卻需要較高的劑量。進一步檢測大螟與二化螟的乙醯膽鹼酯酶，以及加保扶與陶斯松對這兩種水稻蛀心蟲的乙醯膽鹼酯酶之抑制形式發現，大螟乙醯膽鹼酯酶對碘化硫代乙醯膽鹼有較高的Km。除此之外，陶斯松與加保扶對這兩種水稻蛀心蟲乙醯膽鹼酯酶的抑制方式，也顯示出不同抑制模式。Km的差異與不同的抑制方式可能是造成這兩種水稻蛀心蟲對陶斯松和加保扶的感受性不一樣的原因。摘要 [...] -i Abstract [...] -iii 目錄 [...] -iv 前言 [...] - 1 前人研究 [...] - 2 材料與方法 [...] - 9 結果 [...] - 20 討論 [...] - 24 引用文獻 [...] - 30 圖表 [...] - 37 附表 [...] - 5...|$|E
