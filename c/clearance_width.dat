5000|$|During the {{implementation}} of the Berlin-Frankfurt (Oder) upgraded railway (Ausbaustrecke, ABS) project, the mainline tracks in the area of Berlin-Karlshorst station and the railway overpass over Treskowallee were completely modernised. The bridge had to be rebuilt due to its age and extensive damage. The <b>clearance</b> <b>width</b> of 15.75 metres was increased to 31.50 metres. An additional pedestrian bridge was built, creating a path to {{the west side of the}} Treskowallee (with a lift and staircase) and the original direct access from Treskowallee to the eastern abutment was reopened. The tram stops will be moved as part of the widening of Treskowallee under the bridge, with each new stop now sited next to the station. The corresponding planning approval was published on 14 October 2011. [...] After several postponements, construction began in early 2012, with an estimated construction period of two years and four months. In May 2012, the old bridge decks were dismantled over Treskowallee and replaced by temporary bridges so that the abutments could be rebuilt. Also preparations were made so that the S-Bahn could be operated over a single track from end of May. After the completion of new abutment, the first new steel superstructure with a weight of 240 tons to accommodate the two mainline tracks was then installed in June 2013. The installation of the superstructure for the two S-Bahn tracks and the new pedestrian overpass took place in early October 2013 and the operation of S-Bahn services on two-tracks was then restored. At this time the completion of the construction work was planned for April 2014. [...] The construction of the new pedestrian overpass was interrupted on 12 October 2013 when a seven-ton section of the bridge fell six metres to the surface of the concourse. Two construction workers were seriously injured and one was slightly injured. One of the seriously injured died after a few hours in the Berlin Emergency Hospital. The section of the bridge that crashed could not be raised and installed until February 2014. The planned time for the completion was significantly exceeded. Upon completion of bridge works the district will, in coordination with the BVG and the Berlin water authority, reconstruct the street of Treskowallee and the new tram stops will be installed. Due to the need for a separate planning procedure, work will begin in 2017 and completion is scheduled for 2019.|$|E

These materials are currently cut by punching technology, which shows degrading behaviour as the tool wears out. A viable option for Li-ion battery electrode manufacturing is the use of remote laser cutting. However, the operation requires fulfilling both productivity and quality aspects to substitute the conventional production method. One of the most critical aspects in quality is the <b>clearance</b> <b>width,</b> which is defined as the extent of the exposed middle layer of the sandwich at the laser cut kerf. This work investigates the quality aspects of laser cutting of Li-ion electrodes when a green fibre laser source (λ= 532 nm, τ= 1 ns) is used rather than the more traditional infrared (IR) fibre laser source (λ= 1, 064 nm, τ= 250 ns). The processing conditions were investigated to reveal the technological feasibility zones. <b>Clearance</b> <b>width</b> was studied within the technological feasibility zones for all the material-laser combinations. Results showed that high productivity criterion is met by the IR system, since cutting speed could reach 30 m/min with 54 Waverage laser power on both anode and cathode.

To mitigate these upstream instabilities, a convergent radial flow in the die entrance has been created. In fact, the ultimate objective of the present work is to examine the effect of the <b>clearance</b> <b>width</b> of radial flow on the appearance and development of gross melt fracture defect. So, capillary rheometer experiments were performed with linear polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) oil. As for the influence of radial flow width on the morphology of gross melt fracture defect, extrudate photographs show that this imperfection can be mitigated since its frequency is higher and amplitude smaller when the gap of radial flow decreases. Such results may be related both to shear and elongational components of radial flow. Actually, when gap width is very small compared to the external diameter of radial flow, shear deformations become more enhanced with respect to the elongational deformations and thus the helical gross melt fracture becomes more like a surface defect than volume defect...|$|E

40|$|Laser {{cutting of}} Li-ion battery {{electrodes}} represents {{an alternative to}} mechanical blanking that avoids complications associated with tool wear and allows assembly of different cell geometries with a single device. In this study, laser cutting of LiCoO 2 Li-ion battery electrodes is performed at up to 5 m/s with a 1064 nm wavelength nanosecond pulsed fiber laser with a maximum average power of 500 W and a repetition rate of up to 2 MHz. Minimum average cutting power for cathode and anode multi-layer films is established for 12 parameter groups with velocities over the range 1 - 5 m/s, varying laser pulse fluence and overlap. Within the tested parameter range, minimum energy per unit cut length is found to decrease with increasing repetition rate and velocity. SEM analysis of the resulting cut edges reveals visible <b>clearance</b> <b>widths</b> in the range 20 - 50 mu m, with cut quality found to improve with velocity due {{to a reduction in}} lateral heat conduction losses. Raman line map spectra reveal changes in the cathode at 60 mu m from the cut edge, where bands at 486 cm(- 1) and 595 cm(- 1), corresponding to the E-g and A(1 g) modes of LiCoO 2, are replaced with a single wide band centered at 544 cm(- 1), and evidence of carbon black is no longer present. No changes in Raman spectra are observed in the anode. The obtained results suggest that further improvements in cutting efficiency and quality could be achieved by increasing the repetition rate above 2 MHz, thereby improving ablation efficiency of the metallic conductor layers.

Both techniques have disadvantages such as tool wear, process instability, inconsistency of cut quality, and redesign of mechanical cutting processes due to various battery sizes. High speed remote laser cutting overcomes these disadvantages with characteristics such as contact-free process, high energy concentration, low noise level, fast processing speed, very narrow heat affected zone, applicability to nearly all materials, and flexibility of laser power.

In the process, the radial clearance between the rotor tip and housing is increased from the nominal clearance s = 0. 3 mm (Clearance 0) in three steps to 1. 0 mm (Clearance 3). In addition to this, a fourth clearance configuration with axially increasing <b>clearance</b> <b>width</b> is measured (Clearance 4). As compared to the nominal performance map, the operating range of the compressor continually decreases as the clearance is increased, and has less than 80 % of its original size for Clearance 3.

40|$|Laser {{cutting of}} {{lithium-ion}} battery electrodes {{has been shown}} to be a viable alternative to mechanical blanking for some specific electrode types, yielding similar cut quality and throughput but with decreased on-going costs due to lower maintenance requirements. The multitude of electrode chemistries within the lithium-ion classification, particularly with regards to the cathode, together with the sensitive nature of battery components such as the polymeric separator films and electrodes themselves, requires careful assessment of defects for each electrode type. In the present work, cutting of LiNiMnCoO 2 (LNMC) coated aluminium cathodes and graphite coated copper anodes is performed at 100 mm/s with a 1064 nm pulsed fibre laser with 25 μm spot size, varying the pulse duration, energy and repetition rate over the ranges 4 - 200 ns, 8 - 935 μJ and 20 - 500 kHz, respectively.

40|$|Derzeitige Schraubenmotorkonstruktionen basieren auf Entwicklungen aus dem Kompressorenbereich und weisen dementsprechend ein noch hohes Optimierungs-potenzial insbesondere der Energiewandlung auf. Untersuchungen zur Energiewandlung in Schraubenmotoren haben gerade für den Dampfschraubenmotor (aber auch für die übrigen Motorkonzepte) als wesentliche Verlustquellen Spaltverluste während der Kammerfüllung sowie Drosselverluste am Einlass ergeben. Primäre Aufgabe der Weiterentwicklung von Schraubenmotoren mit dem Ziel einer Steigerung der Energiewandlungsgüte muss es daher sein, die Füllung der Arbeitskammer zu verbessern. In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden die Ergebnisse aus den Untersuchungen zur geometrischen Optimierung des Füllvorgangs von Schraubenmotoren behandelt. Zu diesem Zweck werden Kennzahlen entwickelt, die eine rein geometrische Beurteilung unterschiedlicher Rotorgeometrien hinsichtlich dieser beiden Verlustanteile (Spaltverluste und Einlassdrosselung) ermöglichen. Untersuchungen von Rotor-geometrien anhand dieser Kennzahlen zeigen, dass eine einfache geometrische Variation von Rotorgeometrien, die heute im Bereich der Schraubenkompressoren üblich sind, für den Einsatz im Motorbetrieb nur ein geringes Optimierungspotenzial besitzen. Ursache sind die komplexen Zusammenhänge zwischen den Verlustmechanismen mit ihren häufig gegenläufigen Wirkungen auf die Energiewandlung. Verbessert wird diese Situation durch geometrische Veränderungen des Einlassbereiches in Form von Steuerscheiben auf den Rotoren sowie konischen Rotoren. Die dargestellten Zusammenhänge bleiben zwar auch für diese Geometrien erhalten, aufgrund der vergrößerten Einlassflächen ergibt sich jedoch eine, für den Motorbetrieb vorteilhafte, Verschiebung des Optimierungspotenzials hin zu größeren inneren Volumen-verhältnissen. Eine Reduzierung des Hauptrotorumschlingungswinkels kann hierbei ebenfalls zu einer Verbesserung der Energiewandlungsgüte durch verminderte Spaltverluste beitragen. Einen ersten Schritt zu einer Verbesserung der Einlassbedingungen in Schrauben-motoren stellt daher der Einsatz von profilierten Einlassscheiben auf Haupt- und Nebenrotor dar. Diese lassen sich unter eher geringem Aufwand in heutige Schraubenmotor-varianten integrieren. Ein deutlich höheres Potenzial zur Verbesserung der Energiewandlung bietet jedoch der Einsatz von konischen Rotoren. This report {{deals with}} the {{quantification}} of two processes which take place during chamber filling and which are manly important for energy conversion in screw-type engines. Based {{on the experience of}} former investigations on screw-type engines it is known that on the one hand gas leakage through the clearances during the filling process {{and on the other hand}} pressure loss at the inlet site of the engine are of wide influence on energy conversion in screw-type engines. In this report a method for estimation of the chamber filling of screw-type engines and therefore of energy conversion will be presented. In a first step key values for analysing the two processes, gas leakage through the clearances during the filling process and pressure loss at the inlet, are shown. These key values are built by means of geometrical rotor parameters. In the following, geometrical variations of the rotor geometries are estimated via the key values (presented). (The variations of male rotor wrap angle, length / diameter ratio, number of lobes on male and female rotor and the inner volume ratio are calculated for an asymmetrical SRM-B-Profile). Especially for a large inner volume ratio, which is interesting for running the machine as an expander in a steam cycle, no optimal geometrical conditions can be found. A geometrical reduction of the operative <b>clearance</b> <b>width,</b> which should reduce the gas leakage too, always causes increased pressure loss at the inlet. Reducing the pressure loss causes increased gas leakage. But the key values for estimation of pressure loss are showing higher gradients for the examined geometrical variations. Therefore for a geometrical optimisation pressure loss at the inlet shut be considered first. In a next step three options for modification of the inlet area with regard to an improvement of the chamber filling are investigated. These are an inlet disc at one rotor (in the shown example at the male rotor), the use of conical rotors and finally inlet discs at the male and the female rotor. Based on the calculations for all variants a positive effect on chamber filling may be expected, but the option with an inlet disc at the male rotor shows the highest potential. It is mainly influenced by a reduction of gas leakage while the inlet situation shows no significant differences. But the volume of the inlet area at the disc operates like a kind of exhaust chamber which causes a loss of energy conversion. For an improvement of energy conversion by the advantage of an increased chamber filling it is necessary to design the volume of the exhaust chamber as small as possible. Conical rotors have shown also an increase of chamber filing. In contrast to the inlet disc it is mainly influenced by a reduction of pressure loss at the inlet. Therefore we can also expect an improvement of energy conversion by the use of conical rotors. But a final point to make is that manufacturing of these conical rotors is presently not investigated. The option of inlet discs at the male an the female rotor is an intermediate step between the cylindrical rotors and the conical ones. In this case the advantage of an increased chamber filling is combined with an easy way of manufacturing but without the disadvantage of an exhaust chamber. However the potential of improvement of chamber filling is less in comparison to the conical rotors...|$|E

An experiment facility has been constructed at UW-Madison to measure the leakage rate and pressure drop of S-CO 2 flow through labyrinth seals. Various geometries and conditions have been tested to study the flow characteristic and provide validation data for numerical study. The CFD simulation of this scenario is performed under the framework of an open source CFD code OpenFOAM. Fluid properties of S-CO 2 are implemented into the code.

Optimization of the seal geometry is performed by studying the effects of geometrical parameters like radial <b>clearance,</b> tooth <b>width,</b> cavity depth, cavity width, and the number of teeth. It has been found that as the cavity width is increased individually the leakage rate through the seal decreases, whereas increasing the radial clearance causes an increase in the leakage rate.

40|$|The {{labyrinth}} seal is a non-contact annular type sealing device {{used to reduce}} the internal leakage of the working fluid which {{is caused by the}} pressure difference between each stage in a turbomachine. Reducing the leakage mass flow rate of the working fluid through the {{labyrinth seal}} is desirable because it improves the efficiency of the turbomachine. The carry-over coefficient, based on the divergence angle of the jet, changed with flow parameters with fixed seal geometry while earlier models expressed the carry-over coefficient solely as a function of seal geometry. For both compressible and incompressible flows, the Reynolds number based on clearance was the only flow parameter which could influence the carry-over coefficient. In the case of incompressible flow based on the simulations for various seal geometries and operating conditions, for a given Reynolds number, the carry-over coefficient strongly depended on radial <b>clearance</b> to tooth <b>width</b> ratio. Moreover, in general, the lower the Reynolds number, the larger is the divergence angle of the jet and this results in a smaller carry-over coefficient at lower Reynolds numbers. However, during transition from laminar to turbulent, the carry-over coefficient reduced initially and once the Reynolds number attained a critical value, the carry-over coefficient increased again. In the case of compressible flow, the carry-over coefficient had been slightly increased if radial <b>clearance</b> to tooth <b>width</b> ratio and radial clearance to tooth pitch ratio were increased. Further, the carry-over coefficient did not considerably change if only radial <b>clearance</b> to tooth <b>width</b> ratio was decreased. The discharge coefficient for compressible and incompressible flows depended only on the Reynolds number based on clearance. The discharge coefficient of the tooth in a single cavity labyrinth seal was equivalent to that in a multiple tooth labyrinth seal indicating that flow downstream had negligible effect on the discharge coefficient. In particular, for compressible fluid under certain flow and seal geometric conditions, the discharge coefficient did not increase with an increase in the Reynolds number. It was correlated to the pressure ratio, Pr. Moreover, it was also related {{to the fact that the}} flow of the fluid through the constriction became compressible and the flow eventually became choked. At low pressure ratios (less than 0. 7), Saikishan?s incompressible model deviated from CFD simulation results. Hence, the effects of compressibility became significant and both the carry-over coefficient compressibility factor and the discharge coefficient compressibility factor needed to be considered and included into the leakage model. The carry-over coefficient compressibility factor, phi, had two linear relationships with positive and negative slopes regarding the pressure ratios. This result was not associated with the seal geometry because the seal geometry ratios for each instance were located within the nearly same ranges. Further, the phi-Pr relationship was independent of the number of teeth regardless of single and multiple cavity labyrinth seals. The discharge coefficient compressibility factor, psi, was a linear relationship with pressure ratios across the tooth as Saikishan predicted. However, in certain flow and seal geometric conditions, Saikishan?s model needed to be modified for the deviation appearing when the pressure ratios were decreased. Hence, a modified psi-Pr relationship including Saikishan?s model was presented in order to compensate for the deviation between the simulations and his model...|$|R

The depth normalized by the tip <b>clearance</b> and the <b>width</b> normalized by the tip chord are selected as the design variables. The stall margin and peak efficiency are used as the objective functions. The Latin Hypercube Sampling technique was used to select the sample points in the design space. Based on the numerical results of the sample points, the radial basis function network model of the artificial neural network was constructed. The NSGA-II multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is then employed to search for Pareto-optimal solutions. The leave-one-out cross validation method was also {{used to evaluate the}} precision of the radial basis function network model. The results of the optimization show the present method can be effectively used for the design of circumferential casing grooves to take account of the stall margin and efficiency. From the Pareto-optimal solutions, two groove configurations are selected and the internal flow fields are compared with the smooth casing. The effect mechanism of the circumferential casing grooves on the performance of the transonic compressor is discussed by the analysis of the flow in the blade tip region...|$|R
50|$|In a large displacement, {{high-power}} engine, a 60° V12 {{fits into}} a longer and narrower space than a V8 {{and most other}} V configurations, which {{is a problem in}} modern cars, but less so in heavy trucks, and seldom a problem in large stationary engines. The V12 is common in locomotive and battle tank engines, where high power is required, but the width of the engine is constrained by tight railway <b>clearances</b> or street <b>widths,</b> while the length of the vehicle is more flexible. It is often used in marine engines where great power is required, and the hull width is limited, but a longer vessel allows faster hull speed. In twin-propeller boats, two V12 engines can be narrow enough to sit side-by-side, while three V12 engines are sometimes used in high-speed three-propeller configurations. Large, fast cruise ships can have six or more V12 engines. In historic piston-engine fighter and bomber aircraft, the long, narrow V12 configuration used in high-performance aircraft made them more streamlined than other engines, particularly the short, wide radial engine. During World War II the power of fighter engines was stepped up to extreme levels using multi-speed superchargers and ultra-high octane gasoline, so the extreme smoothness of the V12 prevented the powerful engines from tearing apart the light airframes of fighters (often made out of wood and canvas rather than aluminum). After World War II, the compact, more powerful, and vibration-free turboprop and turbojet engines replaced the V12 in aircraft applications.|$|R
50|$|On 7 August 1919, {{three weeks}} after the victory parade, under cover of secrecy and dressed in his warrant officer uniform, Charles Godefroy took off at 7.20 a.m. from the {{airfield}} of Villacoublay in a biplane “Nieuport 11 Bébé” (Bébé = baby - because of its low wing span of 24.67 ft / 24’8’’ or 7.52 m). He reached the Porte Maillot shortly thereafter. Coming from the west, he circled the Arc de Triomphe twice and began the approach along the Avenue de la Grande-Armée. He gathered speed and forced the plane down and through the Arc. He did not have much <b>clearance</b> - the <b>width</b> of the Arc is 47.57 ft / 47’6’’ (14.50 m). He passed at a low level over a tram in which passengers threw themselves to the ground, and many passers-by ran away frightened. Godefroy flew over the Place de la Concorde before returning to the airfield, where his mechanic checked over the engine. No one at the airfield had taken any notice of the flight, which had lasted half an hour.The journalist Jacques Mortane had the whole event filmed and photographed. Articles have been published in many newspapers. The film screening was banned by the Commissioner of Police.Godefroy stayed officially in the background, but his name could not be kept secret for long. The authorities disapproved of the event and were afraid of it being imitated, but Godefroy escaped with only a warning.|$|R
40|$|Windback seals work {{similarly}} to labyrinth seals {{except for the}} effect of helical groove. These seals are essentially a tooth on stator or tooth on rotor labyrinth seal where the grooves are a continuous helical cut like a thread. Windback seals are used in centrifugal gas compressor to keep oil out of the gas face seal area. These face seals cannot be contaminated by oil. A purge gas {{is applied to the}} seal to help force the oil back into the bearing area. The windback seal should be designed to prevent any oil contamination into the supply plenum and to reduce purge gas leakage. The CFD simulations have been performed with the effect of <b>clearance,</b> tooth <b>width,</b> cavity shape, shaft rotation, eccentricity, and tooth location on the seal leakage performance and the flow field inside the seal. The leakage flow rate increases with increasing the pressure differential, rotor speed, radial clearance, cavity size, and shaft diameter and with decreasing the tooth width. The eccentricity has a minimal effect for the windback seal. From oil simulations, the windback seal with 25 % rotor eccentricity has some of the journal bearing action and drives back flow into the gas plenum. However the windback seal can be used to force the oil back into the bearing side before starting the compressor by applying a purge gas flow since the positive axial velocity inside the cavity is larger than the negative axial velocity. m A Rw cav & / ? is constant for varying shaft rotation since the leakage flow rate for the windback seal increases linearly as the the rotor speed increases. The leakage flow rate for the windback seal increases as the groove size increases due to the pumping action of the windback seal. A windback seal design based upon the numerical simulations that minimize gas leakage and help prevent gas face seal oil contamination was optimized. The windback seal has two leakage flow paths. Since the leakage flow rate under teeth of windback seals is the same as for a similar geometry labyrinth seal, the flow under the teeth can be predicted by two-dimensional labyrinth seal analysis. An empirical model for the leakage rate through the cavity has been developed which fits the data {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 12...|$|R
2500|$|As {{competition}} in the wind market increases, companies are seeking ways to draw greater efficiency from their designs. One of the predominant ways wind turbines have gained performance is by increasing rotor diameters, and thus blade length. Retrofitting current turbines with larger blades mitigates the need and risks associated with a system-level redesign. By incorporating carbon fiber into parts of existing blade systems, manufacturers may increase {{the length of the}} blades without increasing their overall weight. For instance, the spar cap, a structural element of a turbine blade, commonly experiences high tensile loading, making it an ideal candidate to utilize the enhanced tensile properties of carbon fiber in comparison to glass fiber. Higher stiffness and lower density translates to thinner, lighter blades offering equivalent performance. [...] In a 10-MW turbine—which will become more common in offshore systems by 2021—blade lengths may reach over 100 m and weigh up to 50 metric tons when fabricated out of glass fiber. A switch to carbon fiber in the structural spar of the blade yields weight savings of 20 to 30 percent, or approximately 15 metric tons. [...] The compressive properties of carbon fiber do not differ significantly from those of glass fiber. [...] It is therefore economical to replace glass fiber components under compression with carbon fiber components. [...] Improving performance through weight reductions rather than increasing scale also has advantages in transportation. [...] The size of a wind turbine, its blades and tower, are all limited by the height and <b>width</b> <b>clearances,</b> and turning radius, of the route used to transport the components to the installation site. The scale of these pieces has in some cases forced the adoption of Schnabel trailers.|$|R
40|$|On-street parking {{has been}} {{considered}} problematic by engineers for many years. In fact, numerous studies have concluded that diagonal or angle parking in particular is potentially more of a safety concern than parallel or no parking at all. It is a common position of many states, including Iowa, to discourage or completely prohibit angle parking on primary road extensions in urban areas. However, with the acceptance of “context sensitive design” and traffic calming techniques, policies for on-street parking are receiving re -consideration in many agencies including the FHWA. This study was undertaken to analyze operational and safety histories {{in the state of}} Iowa where various types of on-street parking have existed for many years, concentrating in particular on smaller communities. Specifically of interest was a comparison of diagonal parking locations to other types with regard to related crash histories. If possible, it was intended to develop guidelines to assist Iowa Department of Transportation designers in the consideration of parking requirements for road improvements through small communities. In this regard, several criteria were analyzed to determine possible contribution to crash history including road <b>width,</b> <b>clearance</b> to parked vehicles, traffic volumes, community population, and length of parking area. None of these factors, {{with the possible exception of}} population, displayed a clearly definable relationship to crash history. However, when average crash rates for various parking types were compared for non-intersection crashes, differences in rates between areas with diagonal parking and those with parallel parking were almost negligible. In fact, those observed rates were less than sample locations with no parking at all. These results seem to indicate that indeed there may exist no compelling justification for blanket prohibition of angle parking along Iowa’s primary extensions in all urban areas. Rather, a case-by-case investigation with each project design of the most applicable parking type would seem appropriate in smaller communities...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into the simulation of ship manoeuvring in restricted waters; in particular ship squat and ship-bank interaction. A time-domain mathematical model has been developed to predict unsteady squat and dynamic acceleration effects for a vessel travelling in non-uniform water depth. A quasi-steady approach was adopted, where the prediction at each time step is based on steady-state heave force and pitch moment in uniform water depth. A comprehensive set of model scale experiments was conducted to investigate squat in both uniform and non-uniform water depth. Regression analysis was performed on the uniform water depth test data to develop empirical equations for steady-state squat, which were used as input to the mathematical model. The equations apply to a full form vessel and are dependent on under keel <b>clearance</b> parameters, channel <b>width</b> parameters and depth Froude number. Empirical correction factors were also developed to estimate the effect of propulsion on squat. Good correlation was observed between predictions from the squat mathematical model and steady-state sinkage measurements {{for a wide range of}} water depth to draught ratios. Predictions from the mathematical model were also compared with unsteady sinkage measurements on a ship model travelling over a simplified ramp bank. The general trend of the predicted unsteady sinkage was reasonable, improving the realism of simulation for abrupt changes in water depth compared to predictions where acceleration effects in the vertical plane are neglected. However, the maximum unsteady sinkage was not always predicted accurately, which may be attributable to limitations and assumptions associated with the technique. A comprehensive model scale experiment program was conducted to investigate ship-bank interaction. The following parameters were systematically varied for three different hull forms: flooded bank height, water depth, bank slope, lateral ship to bank distance, vessel speed and vessel draught. The results from these experiments were used to develop a bank parameter to estimate the effects of lateral surface piercing and flooded banks. This parameter was utilised in regression analyses to develop empirical formulae for steady-state bank induced sway force and yaw moment. The empirical formulae were validated against independent model scale measurements from literature and showed reasonable agreement for a range of cases. The formulae were then incorporated into the existing mathematical model of the AMC ship-handling simulator. The quasi-steady technique was used to predict the path of a vessel for a real-life manoeuvre where bank induced yaw moment is used to aid a turn. The proposed bank effect simulation method was found to provide a satisfactory solution to the problem of ship-bank interaction simulation...|$|R
