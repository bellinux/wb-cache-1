5000|$|According to Orthodox {{interpretations of}} Halakha, <b>converts</b> face {{a limited number}} of restrictions. A {{marriage}} between a female <b>convert</b> and a kohen (members of the priestly class) is prohibited and any children of the union do not inherit their father's kohen status. While a Jew by birth may not marry a mamzer, a <b>convert</b> can. <b>Converts</b> can become rabbis. For instance, Rabbi Meir Baal Ha Nes is thought to be a descendant of a proselyte. Rabbi Akiva was also a very well known son of <b>converts.</b> The Talmud lists many of the Jewish nation's greatest leaders who had either descended from or were themselves <b>converts.</b> In fact, King David is descended from Ruth, a <b>convert</b> to Judaism. (...) In Orthodox and Conservative communities which maintain tribal distinctions, <b>converts</b> become Yisraelim (Israelites), ordinary Jews with no tribal or inter-Jewish distinctions. <b>Converts</b> typically follow the customs of their congregations.

5|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are relatively inefficient at <b>converting</b> on-board fuel energy to propulsion {{as most of}} the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is idling. Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at <b>converting</b> stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through regenerative braking. Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%.|$|E

METHODS: This study analyzed kidney transplants <b>converted</b> to SRL and transplanted between July 1991 and April 2007. Patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1 : African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL + CI; group 2 : non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL + CI; group 3 : African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL + MMF; group 4 : non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL + MMF. RESULTS: A total of 242 patients was included. Demographics, baseline immunosuppression, and reason for SRL conversion were similar among groups. Patients <b>converted</b> to SRL + CI regimens had significantly higher rates of acute rejection before SRL conversion, but equal rates after conversion. Development of proteinuria was similar across groups. African-American patients <b>converted</b> to SRL + MMF tended to have poorer outcomes compared with African-American patients <b>converted</b> to SRL + CI. Non-African-American patients <b>converted</b> to SRL + MMF tended to have better graft outcomes compared with non-African-American patients <b>converted</b> to SRL + CI. CONCLUSIONS: African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL may benefit from continued CI, whereas non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL seem to have better outcomes with MMF. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings...|$|R
