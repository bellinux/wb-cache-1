It also houses the tourist information centre. Also in Glastonbury, the Somerset Rural Life Museum is a museum {{of the social and}} agricultural history of Somerset, housed in buildings surrounding a 14th-century barn once belonging to Glastonbury Abbey. It was used as a tithe barn [...] for the storage of arable produce, particularly wheat and rye, from the abbey's home farm of approximately [...] Threshing and winnowing would also have been carried out in the barn. The barn which was built from local [...] "shelly" [...] limestone, with thick timbers supporting the stone tiling of the roof. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building, and is a Scheduled monument. The barn and courtyard contain displays of farm machinery from the Victorian and early 20th century periods. Other exhibits show local crafts, including willow coppicing, mud horse fishing on the flats of Bridgwater Bay, peat digging on the Somerset Levels and the production of milk, cheese, and cider. In reconstructed rooms detailing domestic life in the nearby village of Butleigh, the story of one farm worker, John Hodges, is told from cradle to grave. Outside, there is a beehive and rare breeds of poultry and sheep in the <b>cider</b> <b>apple</b> orchard.|$|E

5000|$|In the UK the Long Ashton Research Station {{categorised}} <b>cider</b> <b>apples</b> in 1903 {{into four}} main types {{according to the}} nature of their flavour components. [...] For cider production {{it is important that the}} fruit contains high sugar levels which encourage fermentation and raise the final alcohol levels. <b>Cider</b> <b>apples</b> therefore often have higher sugar levels than dessert and cooking apples. It is often also considered important for <b>cider</b> <b>apples</b> to contribute tannins, which add depth to the finished cider's flavour.|$|R
2500|$|In the cider-producing {{counties}} in the South West of England (primarily Cornwall, [...] Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Gloucestershire and Herefordshire) or South East England (Kent, Sussex, Essex and Suffolk) wassailing refers to a traditional ceremony that involves singing and drinking the health of trees on Twelfth Night {{in the hopes that}} they might better thrive. The purpose of wassailing is to awaken the <b>cider</b> <b>apple</b> trees and to scare away evil spirits to ensure a good harvest of fruit in the Autumn. The ceremonies of each wassail vary from village to village but they generally all have the same core elements. A wassail King and Queen lead the song and/or a processional tune to be played/sung from one orchard to the next; the wassail Queen is then lifted into the boughs of the tree where she places toast soaked in wassail from the clayen cup as a gift to the tree spirits (and to show the fruits created the previous year). In some counties the youngest boy or [...] "Tom Tit" [...] will stand in for the Queen and hang the cider soaked toast in the tree. Then an incantation is usually recited.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{processes}} that occurred during domestication {{remains one of the}} central questions in genetics. In addition to fundamental importance, it can indeed provide knowledge on the genetic bases for further crop improvement. As an example, apple {{is one of the most}} important fruit crops in temperate regions, having both an economic and a cultural value. Dessert apples are used for consumption as fruits while <b>cider</b> <b>apples</b> are used to produce cider. Yet few traits are known to be different, despite overlapping between dessert and <b>cider</b> <b>apples,</b> namely fruit size and bitterness. A population genomics approach was used for detecting loci involved in the differentiation between <b>cider</b> and dessert <b>apples,</b> on two core collections of old cultivars, one for dessert apples and one for <b>cider</b> <b>apples.</b> A set of 96 gene fragments, localized in 6 areas of the apple genome bearing QTLs for traits of agronomic interest, was re-sequenced and the Illumina 8 K SNP chip was used to genotype these two collections. The low estimates of per locus differentiation (ie Fst) between dessert and <b>cider</b> <b>apples</b> indicated that these two pools recently derive from common ancestors, except for 2 genomic regions exhibiting higher Fst values and potentially involved in selective processes. Departure from neutrality was also tested for each “population” using Tajima’s D and Fu and Li’s D and several areas of the genome were found to have significant decrease of both. Such knowledge could be helpful in new selection programs, bringing their efficiency to a higher level...|$|R
