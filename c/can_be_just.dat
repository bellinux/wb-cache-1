5|$|This {{eruption}} style {{can take}} the form of either lava flows, spreading across the floor of the paterae, or lava lakes. Except for observations by Galileo during its seven close flybys, {{it can be difficult to}} tell the difference between a lava lake and a lava flow eruption on a patera floor, due to inadequate resolution and similar thermal emission characteristics. Intra-patera lava flow eruptions, such as the Gish Bar Patera eruption in 2001, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as voluminous as those seen spreading out across the Ionian plains. Flow-like features have also been observed within a number of paterae, like Camaxtli Patera, suggesting that lava flows periodically resurface their floors.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented {{is a step in}} the characteristic impedance of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E

25|$|Lasers in {{this class}} may cause damage if the beam enters the eye directly. This {{generally}} applies to lasers powered from 5–500mW.

A diffuse reflection is generally not hazardous but specular reflections <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as dangerous as direct exposures. Protective eyewear is recommended when direct beam viewing of ClassIIIb lasers may occur. Lasers at the high power end of this class may also present a fire hazard and can lightly burn skin.|$|E

Georgia Tech won the game 27–13 in Athens. The longest winning streak by UGA was 7 games, which occurred twice from 1909–1921 and from 1980–1984. Georgia Tech accumulated a 10-game winning streak, its longest over UGA, from 1958–1961. Like most series, there is a distinct advantage to being the home team. The home record since 1906 is 111–53 (67.7%) while 23 games in the series have been played on neutral courts.|$|E

Of all the Naruto protagonists, Tenten {{receives}} the least amount of screen time in the series. Despite her lack of appearances, series creator Masashi Kishimoto favors her design more than those of any of the other female characters he has created. In battle, Tenten specializes in weaponry, ranging from projectiles to close-combat weapons and even explosives by {{the second part of the}} series. During a fight, she uses the hundreds of weapons stored in scrolls she carries with her to bombard opponents with pinpoint accuracy. Tenten uses this expertise to help Neji Hyuga train his defensive techniques, and she holds him in high regard since he can always block her attacks. In the series epilogue, Tenten runs her own weapons shop. Her Japanese voice actress is Yukari Tamura, and her English voice actress is Danielle Judovits.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, The Village Voice writer Terry Guerin said Cosby {{was past}} his prime. Among the reasons, [...] "making {{spokesman}} commercials for such established heels as White Owl cigars and Pan American airlines. He {{has evolved into}} a kind of self-parodying sap, the kind of flagrant, perpetual parader Sammy Davis has always been". [...] "The Noble Cos," [...] a 1986 satirical editorial by Edward Sorel for The Nation, was written in Cosby's imagined voice. It echoed the comments of other authors that Cosby had become out-of-touch with lower-class African Americans. In response to this sentiment, Cosby said in 1997, [...] "So this buddy says, 'I didn't mind your commercials for Jello, Del Monte, Ford cars... Ideal Toys, or Coca-Cola, although Coke does do business in South Africa... But, Bill, why do commercials for those crooks at E. F. Hutton?' My buddy didn't understand my commercials improve race relations. Y'see, by showing that a black man <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as money-hungry as a white man...

500|$|The final scene, {{featuring}} {{a conversation between}} Mulder and Scully, has been examined by author V. Alan White due to its perceived religious undertones. In the book The Philosophy of The X-Files, {{he notes that the}} final scene [...] "undermines Mulder's seemingly persistent scorn of traditional" [...] religion and his subtle acceptance of theism. In previous episodes—mainly those dealing with Scully's Catholicism—Mulder shows a lack of approval {{when it came to the}} concept of organized religion, often pointing out that [...] "theologians <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as dogmatic as scientists" [...] when it comes to unexplained phenomena. White proposes that this needling may be intentional on Mulder's part, as a form of [...] "ironic reversal of [...] skepticism about the paranormal". However, the final lines of [...] "The Truth" [...] see Mulder talking about a belief in [...] "something greater than us, greater than any alien force". White also points out the fact that during this scene Mulder grabs Scully's gold cross, an icon that symbolizes her belief through much of the series.|$|E
