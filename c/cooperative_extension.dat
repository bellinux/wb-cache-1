25|$|A common {{perception}} is that the birth of <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Extension</b> followed passage of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, which provided federal funds to land-grant universities to support Extension work.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{effective}} execution of parallel applications on emerging multicore and manycore {{systems in the}} presence of modern synchronization and coordination constraints. Synchronization and coordination can contribute significant productivity and performance overheads to the development and execution of parallel programs. Higher-level programming models, such as the Task Parallel Model and Actor Model, provide abstractions {{that can be used to}} simplify writing parallel programs, in contrast to lower-level programming models that directly expose locks, threads and processes. However, these higher-level models often lack efficient support for general synchronization patterns that are necessary for a wide range of applications. Many modern synchronization and coordination constructs in parallel programs can incur significant performance overheads on current runtime systems, or significant productivity overheads when the programmer is forced to complicate their code to mitigate these performance overheads. We believe that a cooperation between the programmer and the runtime system is necessary to reduce the parallel overhead and to execute the available parallelism efficiently {{in the presence of}} synchronization constraints. In a cooperative approach, an executing entity yields control to other entities at well-defined points during its execution. This thesis shows that the use of cooperative techniques is critical to performance and scalability of certain parallel programming models, especially in the presence of modern synchronization and coordination constraints such as asynchronous tasks, futures, phasers, data-driven tasks, and actors. In particular, we focus on <b>cooperative</b> <b>extensions</b> and runtimes for the async-finish Task Parallel Model and the Actor Model in this thesis. Our work shows that cooperative techniques simplify programmability and deliver significant performance improvements by reducing the overhead in modern parallel programming models...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the study was to {{quantify}} the parameters of successful agricultural producers. Through the use of the Financial and Risk Management (FARM) Assistance database, this study evaluated economic measures for row-crop producers, livestock producers and diversified producers (farms which can not be classified as primarily crop or livestock). The sample population for this study was agricultural producers (N= 196) who had participated in the Texas <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Extensions</b> FARM Assistance program in the years 2002 to 2004. Financial performance was determined by several financial measures, such as net cash farm income, ending cash reserves, return on assets (ROA), equity growth and working capital. In addition, information gathered about the FARM Assistance clientele was used to examine the relationship between their demographic backgrounds and their financial success. SPSS was used to calculate frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations, and administer one-way analysis of variance and independent sample t-test. The major findings of the study showed that the average age of the FARM Assistance participants was 51 years old. A large number of the participants (41. 90 %) in the FARM Assistance program had a Bachelor of Science degree. This study also revealed that the mean net cash farm income for the 196 operations was $ 91, 970 with a range from negative $ 152, 990 to $ 822, 610. Row crop producers had a statistically significant higher ProScore index, net cash farm income, and net cash farm income per acre than livestock farms. Producers who started as farm employees had a statistically significant higher ProScore index than producers who started on their own, partnered with a family member, or those who selected other. Finally, producers who had fulltime, off farm employment had a statistically significant lower ProScore index than those producers who had part-time employment or those who did not have an off farm job...|$|R
40|$|File system virtual {{appliances}} (FSVAs) {{address a}} major headache faced by third-party FS developers: OS version compatibility. By packaging their FS implementation in a VM, {{separate from the}} VM that runs user applications, they can avoid {{the need to provide}} an FS port for every kernel version and OS distribution. A small FS-agnostic proxy, maintained by the core OS developers, connects the FSVA to whatever kernel version the user chooses. Evaluation of prototype FSVA support in Linux, using Xen as the VM platform, demonstrates that this separation can be efficient and maintain desired OS and virtualization features. Using three existing file systems and a <b>cooperative</b> caching <b>extension</b> as a case study, we demonstrate that the FSVA architecture can insulate FS implementations from user OS differences that would otherwise require explicit porting changes...|$|R

40|$|The {{main concern}} of an (engineering) design {{process is the}} {{investigation}} and application of novel, {{state of the art}} methodologies on the design of an (engineered) product, in order to increase its anticipated quality in a profitable way. Undoubtedly, design process excellence is vital for a company to stay in business, since it predetermines to a large degree the competitiveness of its products. The employment of well-established approaches aiming at the computer-based improvement of processes seems promising for making strides towards the faster and cheaper development of better products. The support provided by most of the existing approaches is based on prescribed assumptions concerning the evolution of the process. Yet, design processes exhibit an inherent dynamic nature that is less clear in other domains (e. g., routine business processes). As a consequence, many available process support systems fail to provide them with adequate support. The goal of this thesis is to present an approach for the fine-grained support of design processes, taking their inherent dynamic nature into consideration. The developed concepts build on the idea of the process integration of tools that which was contributed by preceding researchers, and extends it towards three directions. First, the original models for process integration are integrated with selected <b>cooperative</b> <b>extensions</b> in order to achieve a better synergy with the administrative level and provide support across several technical workplaces. The second direction {{has to do with the}} extension of the idea of process integration itself. More specifically, the existing mechanism is reworked in order to facilitate the flexible integration of a broader variety of tools according to their assessed capabilities. Last, a reuse mechanism is introduced for the direct and situated reuse of product, media and process traces captured in previous design processes. The overall approach has been validated through implementation in the frame of an interdisciplinary project dealing with the support of the early design phases in chemical engineering...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the development and initial use of Texas <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Extension?s</b> (TCE) White-tailed Deer Management Module (WDMM) delivered over the Internet. The results of this study will provide suggestions about future online wildlife management modules. Data were collected from two populations using questionnaires. A sample of six county Extension agents (CEA?s) and four Extension specialists were selected by an Extension wildlife specialist who perceived them to be professionals in the fields of wildlife and range management. This first sample is also referred to as change agents. The second sample, also known as early users, consisted of 27 anonymous CEA?s and landowners within TCE?s District 10. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to collect and analyze data. The results are as follows: Thus, the development of WDMM was the responsibility of the Extension specialist and researcher. The Extension specialist and researcher did seek professional opinions on content and layout information. Results suggested that CEA?s and Extension specialists agreed the WDMM would be a beneficial educational tool for new landowners. Overall, WDMM was perceived to be user friendly, visually appealing, and provided useful content. Although most change agents responded positively to most questions, there were a few that would like to see more educationally challenging questions. For example, there were a few questions that respondents felt were of the ?elementary? and ?kindergarten? level. They would like more questions concerning management. The majority of early users were in support of WDMM. Data gathered from the WDMM Feedback Questionnaire agreed with data gathered from change agents. In general, most early users said that they were pleased with the WDMM. Recommendations were made based on these findings to expand the WDMM. Some of these include: 1) Expanding WDMM; 2) Replicating this study using random sampling; 3) Collecting computer knowledge and skills and demographics on future studies; 4) Developing similar modules to see if they gain the same positive response...|$|R
