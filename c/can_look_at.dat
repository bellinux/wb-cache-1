5|$|Justification {{for using}} the Sunnah {{as a source of}} law {{can be found in the}} Qur'an. The Qur'an {{commands}} Muslims to follow Muhammad. During his lifetime, Muhammad made it clear that his traditions (along with the Qur'an) should be followed after his death. The overwhelming majority of Muslims consider the sunnah to be essential supplements to and clarifications of the Qur'an. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Qur'an contains many rules for the behavior expected of Muslims but there are no specific Qur'anic rules on many religious and practical matters. Muslims believe that they <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the way of life, or sunnah, of Muhammad and his companions to discover what to imitate and what to avoid.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E
5|$|On {{his last}} day, after oversleeping, Homer {{attempts}} {{to do all}} the things on his list. He has a man-to-man talk with Bart, listens to Lisa play her saxophone, and borrows Ned's camcorder to make a video for Maggie that she <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> when she is older. Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing some of the things on his list. After trying to catch up on time he lost doing these things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family. He then hurries home in time to say goodbye to his children and make love to Marge.|$|E

5|$|Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling) {{are called}} to Lacey's (Mary Mouser) school when she is seen looking at photos of a young woman, Nikki Parkson (Mary Fegreus) who died, after battling a {{terminal}} illness. When Megan looks at a photo, she sees irregularities and without permission from Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) stop Nikki being buried, so they <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her body, much to the horror of Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry). Although Nikki's family say that she committed suicide, Megan finds evidence to suggest otherwise; Nikki's neck has bruising on the bottom, showing that she was strangled. Nikki was being given pills to help her illness by Lillian, though these made her worse, but this kept Lillian in the social limelight, getting sympathy from friends; however Lillian did not kill her. Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), Megan, Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) find out that Nikki's boyfriend Shane (Charlie Semine) was actually working together with Nikki's sister Sara (Jo Armeniox). It is revealed that Shane and Sara killed Nikki, as in Nikki's will she was giving all her money to a fake wildlife foundation which Sara had set up. However, Nikki wanted to switch charities, so Sara killed her to stop her from doing this, with Shane helping her to stage it as suicide, so they could both get the money.|$|E

25|$|OBE can be {{compared}} across different institutions. On an individual level, institutions <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what outcomes a student has achieved to decide what level the student would be at within a new institution. On an institutional level, institutions can compare themselves, by checking to see what outcomes they have in common, and find places where they may need improvement, based on the achievement of outcomes at other institutions. The ability to compare easily across institutions allows students to move between institutions with relative ease. The institutions can compare outcomes to determine what credits to award the student. The clearly articulated outcomes should allow institutions to assess the student’s achievements rapidly, leading to increased movement of students. These outcomes also work for school to work transitions. A potential employer <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> records of the potential employee to determine what outcomes they have achieved. They can then determine if the potential employee has the skills necessary for the job.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes the {{appearance}} of floaters has to be attributed to dark specks in the tear film of the eye. Technically, these are not floaters, but they do look the same {{from the viewpoint of}} the patient. Persons with blepharitis or a dysfunctional meibomian gland are especially prone to this cause, but ocular allergies can also cause the problem. To differentiate between material in the vitreous humour of the eye and debris in the tear film, one <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the effect of blinking: debris in the tear film will move quickly with a blink, while floaters are largely unresponsive to it. Tear film debris is diagnosed by eliminating the possibility of true floaters and macular degeneration.|$|E
25|$|Without {{an actual}} comb one <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the phase vs frequency. Without a carrier–envelope offset all {{frequencies}} are cosines. This {{means that all}} frequencies have the phase zero. The time origin is arbitrary. If a pulse comes at later times, the phase increases linearly with frequency, but still the zero-frequency phase is zero. This phase at zero frequency is the carrier–envelope offset. The second harmonic not only has twice the frequency, but also twice the phase. Thus for a pulse with zero offset the second harmonic of the low-frequency tail is in phase with the fundamental of the high-frequency tail, and otherwise it is not. Spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER) measures how the phase increases with frequency, but it cannot determine the offset, so the name “electric field reconstruction” is a bit misleading.|$|E

500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee. In an interview, she discussed the cover: [...] "Well, both of our other records are me on the cover, and I think it's cool to have that photo, you know, that people <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> and go, 'OK, that's who that is.' But I feel like, by now, they know who we are, and I wanted something really different. I didn't feel like {{we had to put}} a photo on the cover, I wanted it to be more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|E
500|$|The {{open-ended}} {{nature of}} the lyrics has led to many interpretations. Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send [...] "a message of hope" [...] and wish for a [...] "world that is not divided by class, wealth, race, or any other arbitrary criterion". With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song, he said, [...] "I'm not sure, really, about that. I used {{to think it was}} Belfast..." [...] Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono's and his wife Ali's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid-workers. Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open-ended lyrics: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it now and recognize that [...] {{has one of the most}} banal couplets in the history of pop music. But it also contains some of the biggest ideas. In a curious way, that seems to work. If you get any way heavy about these things, you don't communicate. But if you're flip or throwaway about it, then you do. That's one of the paradoxes I've come to terms with." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the third}} match, in Bridgetown, Barbados, Boycott was to face what was later {{said to be}} Holding's {{greatest}} over. Boycott was hit on the gloves by the first delivery, played-and-missed the second outside off stump, was hit on the thigh by the third, fended the next two deliveries away with his bat, and was then bowled by the final delivery. Though in 1987 Boycott would claim a 1966 delivery by Gary Sobers {{to be the best}} he ever faced in cricket, he noted of Holding's over that [...] "for {{the first time in my}} life I <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a scoreboard with a duck against my name and not feel a profound sense of failure." [...] Boycott led an England fight back in the fourth Test. Having watched Holding's over several times on video, and worked in the nets on his game, Boycott came out and made 38 in the first innings and then hit his twentieth Test century. His career run total was now 7,410, gaining on Gary Sobers' record of 8,032.|$|E

500|$|The English {{version of}} First Departure {{received}} mixed to average reviews, earning a 77% rating on GameRankings and a 74 out of 100 average from Metacritic. Many reviewers felt {{that despite the}} updated graphics and sound, the game still felt less refined than more modern role-playing games. IGN found the game to have a [...] "bland, awkwardly-told narrative" [...] with [...] "weak characters", but that it would appeal to fans of older games, stating [...] "If you <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> First Departure and understand that it's based on a very old title, you'll likely be able to overlook the problems and get {{a fair amount of}} satisfaction". GameSpot also stated that the title had [...] "limited appeal" [...] in addition to providing little challenge. Andrew Fitch of 1UP.com, however, called First Departure an [...] "overlooked classic" [...] with [...] "ridiculously engrossing crafting minutiae" [...] and numerous character party combinations that increase its replay value.

500|$|Jackson saw King Kong as {{opportunity}} for technical innovations in motion capture, commissioning Christian Rivers of Weta Digital to supervise {{all aspects of}} Kong's performance. Jackson decided early on {{that he did not}} want Kong to behave like a human, and so he and his team studied hours of gorilla footage. Serkis was cast in the title role in April 2003 and prepared himself by working with gorillas at the London Zoo. He then traveled to Rwanda, observing the actions and behaviors of gorillas in the wild. Rivers explained that the detailed facial performance capture with Serkis was accomplished because of the similarities between human and gorilla faces. [...] "Gorillas have such a similar looking set of eyes and brows, you <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> those expressions and transpose your own interpretation onto them." [...] Photos of silverback gorillas were also superimposed on Kong's image in the early stages of animation. Serkis had to go through two hours of motion capture makeup every day, having 135 small markers attached to different spots on his face. Following principal photography, Serkis had to spend an additional two months on a motion capture stage, miming Kong's movements for the film's digital animators.|$|E

Ray of Light is truly like a prayer, and you know she'll take you there." [...] Roni Sarig, in a review for City Pages, was most impressed by Madonna's vocal range, depth, and clarity and called Ray of Light [...] "her richest, most accomplished record yet." [...] Music critic Robert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "One reason why her new Ray of Light is the most satisfying album of her career is that it reflects the soul-searching {{of a woman who}} is at a point in her life where she <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> herself with surprising candor and perspective." [...] Writing for Melody Maker in February 1998, Mark Roland drew comparisons with the music of St Etienne and Björk's Homogenic album, highlighting Ray of Lights lack of cynicism as its most positive aspect: [...] "It's not an album turned on the lathe of cynical pop manipulation, rather it's been squished out of a lump of clay on a foot-powered wheel. Lovingly teased into life, Ray of Light is like the ugly mug that doesn't match but is all the more special because of it." [...] Joan Anderman from The Boston Globe said that Ray of Light is a remarkable album. He described it as a deeply spiritual dance record, ecstatically textured, a serious cycle of songs that {{goes a long way toward}} liberating Madonna from a career built on scavenged images and cultivated identities. Robert Christgau was less impressed in Playboy, deeming Ray of Light a [...] "great-sounding" [...] but average record because of enlightenment themes that always yield awkward results for pop entertainers, although he praised sensual songs such as [...] "Skin" [...] and [...] "Candy Perfume Girl".|$|E
