The <b>conveying</b> surface {{is divided into two}} regions, which are sectionally pivoted from horizontal and vertical planes.

40|$|Dense phase {{pneumatic}} <b>conveying</b> {{can be a}} most reliable, efficient {{method for}} handling a remarkably wide range of dry bulk solids. Some advantages {{of this type of}} <b>conveying</b> method include high solids/gas ratio, low <b>conveying</b> velocity, thus low power consumption, low product degradation and low pipe wear. However, {{due to the nature of}} discontinuous flow of dense phase <b>conveying,</b> the modeling and controlling of this type of <b>conveying</b> seems to be very difficult if assuming some type of steady state conditions for prediction. This paper will report the research on the transient behaviour of the slug movements through a horizontal pipeline in slug flow pneumatic <b>conveying.</b> The first step of this research is to obtain the fundamental theory for the pressure differential of the system <b>conveying</b> pressure when there is only one slug traveling in the pipeline. In the theory, both instant slug movements and air conservation law were considered. For the next step, by applying this fundamental pressure differential equation, pressure drop models for multiple slugs <b>conveying</b> conditions were proposed by either assuming uniform slug condition or normal distribution slug condition. Finally, the proposed pressure drop models were verified with experimental data and showed the capability of numerically tracing the transient <b>conveying</b> pressure of the dense phase <b>conveying</b> system, i. e. the pressure-time profile of the simulated <b>conveying</b> case. The pressure drop models and transient simulation software derived from these models can be used for predicting operating parameters and slug behaviour within the horizontal slug flow pneumatic <b>conveying</b> system, and have the potential to significantly increase slug <b>conveying</b> efficiency. They can also be used as a controlling algorithm for the control unit of an industrial <b>conveying</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Pneumatic <b>conveying</b> {{has many}} {{noteworthy}} capabilities, and hence its popularity, but it generally has a perceived mystery {{in terms of}} reliable operation. The mode of flow of a material in a pipeline, for example, is often misunderstood, and likewise the influence and role of {{the properties of the}} material to be <b>conveyed</b> are not fully appreciated. With so many materials being either abrasive or friable there is a demand for systems that will <b>convey</b> materials at low velocity, apart from the constant need to minimise power requirements. A low velocity system is generally considered to be more economical to operate than a high velocity dilute phase <b>conveying</b> system. The requirement, therefore, is often for a low velocity dense phase <b>conveying</b> system, regardless of the material to be <b>conveyed</b> and the distance over which it is required to be <b>conveyed.</b> The value of the <b>conveying</b> air velocity required to <b>convey</b> a material is critical to the successful operation of pneumatic <b>conveying</b> systems and this is considered in detail. The lowest value possible will minimise problems of erosive wear and particle degradation in all cases. The power requirements for the <b>conveying</b> system will also be minimised, but the influence on the flow rate of the material is not so predictable. There is, in virtually all cases, a minimum value of <b>conveying</b> air velocity that must be maintained if the system is to operate successfully. A safety margin clearly needs to be added to take account of fluctuations in performance and problems relating {{to the fact that the}} <b>conveying</b> medium is compressible, but this should not be excessive...|$|R
