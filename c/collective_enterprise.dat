25|$|Non-financial cooperatives - such as {{fishermen}} coop or farmers coops of the Antigonish movement, {{continue to}} provide an alternative economic model the world over despite rise of private sector led economic growth, especially for small producers and farmers in accessing markets and negotiating prices collectively. Within Maritimes though, such cooperatives seem to {{have given way to}} more individual enterprises that operate more as 'association' rather than collective business, but continuing to have a very close sense of 'community' and collective identity - be it lobster fishers or dairy farmers. Newer form of economic enterprises of recent times are also generally termed as 'social enterprises' - with dual objective of profit and socially responsible and positive outcomes. Such enterprises don't always have collective ownership, but almost always have a sense of 'community' well-being. Investment Cooperatives are yet another form of <b>collective</b> <b>enterprise,</b> often getting formed to finance a community based enterprise such as alternative energy coop or local-food marketing coop. Shared-economy is yet another form of new wave idea that borrows from same coop principle of community sharing an economy more inclusively; though the potential conflict between the private and corporate profit v/s community benefiting collectively continues to be an ongoing debate; a debate that Antigonish Movement challenged in 1920 and 1930s, and seem to go through in cyclical fashion ever-since. Societies are once again at cross-roads for balancing between individual and corporate wealth, group / cooperative enterprises, and more shared-economies where everyone can share benefits. Legacy and lessons from the Antigonish Movement continue to be relevant in our modern times.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, after {{economic}} reforms enabled some individual entrepreneurialism {{and the creation}} of <b>collective</b> <b>enterprises,</b> the RCCs began to function as grassroots banks that provided credit and savings accounts to families and <b>collective</b> <b>enterprises.</b> In the reform era, the RCCs were intended to serve as a means for the Agricultural Bank of China to funnel credit into rural areas. However, the RCCs were insufficient to meet the high demand for credit in these areas.|$|R
40|$|Private and <b>collective</b> <b>enterprises</b> are {{expected}} to increase overall efficiency in transitional China, partly {{because they are more}} efficient than state owned enterprises. More importantly, this paper argues, they induce efficiency gains in state owned enterprises and the economy as a whole. Empirical evidence from 28 Chinese provinces between 1993 and 1998 gives support to this hypothesis by showing that the activity levels of private <b>enterprises</b> and rural <b>collective</b> <b>enterprises</b> {{have a positive effect on}} regional labor productivity.

60|$|A third {{system of}} {{interests}} upon which practical work may {{be done at}} the present time lies in the complex interdependent developments of transit and housing, questions that lock up inextricably with the problem of re-planning our local government areas. Here, too, the whole world is beginning to realize more and more clearly that private enterprise is wasteful and socially disastrous, that collective control, collective management, and so on to <b>collective</b> <b>enterprise</b> and ownership of building-land, houses, railways, tramways and omnibuses, give the only way of escape from an endless drifting entanglement and congestion of our mobile modern population.|$|E
6000|$|A very {{interesting}} case to discuss {{in relation to}} this question of adjustment {{is that of the}} barrister. A practising barrister under contemporary conditions does indeed give most typically the opportunity for examining the relation of an ordinary self-respecting worldly life, to life under the dispensation of God discovered. A barrister is usually a man of some energy and ambition, his honour is moulded by the traditions of an ancient and antiquated profession, instinctively self-preserving and yet with a real desire for consistency and respect. As a profession it has been greedy and defensively conservative, but it has never been shameless nor has it ever broken faith with its own large and selfish, but quite definite, propositions. It has never for instance had the shamelessness of such a traditionless and undisciplined class as the early factory organisers. It has never had the dull incoherent wickedness of the sort of men who exploit drunkenness and the turf. It offends within limits. Barristers can be, and are, disbarred. But it is now a profession extraordinarily out of date; its code of honour derives from a time of cruder and lower conceptions of human relationship. It apprehends the State as a mere [...] "ring" [...] kept about private disputations; it has not begun to move towards the modern conception of the <b>collective</b> <b>enterprise</b> as the determining criterion of human conduct. It sees its business as a mere play upon the rules of a game between man and man, or between men and men. They haggle, they dispute, they inflict and suffer wrongs, they evade dues, and are liable or entitled to penalties and compensations. The primary business of the law is held to be decision in these wrangles, and as wrangling is subject to artistic elaboration, the business of the barrister is the business of a professional wrangler; he is a bravo in wig and gown who fights the duels of ordinary men because they are incapable, very largely on account of the complexities of legal procedure, of fighting for themselves. His business is never to explore any fundamental right in the matter. His business is to say all that can be said for his client, and to conceal or minimise whatever can be said against his client. The successful promoted advocate, who in Britain and the United States of America is the judge, and whose habits and interests all incline him to disregard the realities of the case in favour of the points in the forensic game, then adjudicates upon the contest.

60|$|When {{elementary}} needs {{have been}} satisfied, the serious happiness of most men depends upon two things: their work, and their human relations. In {{the world that}} we have been picturing, work will be free, not excessive, full of the interest that belongs to a <b>collective</b> <b>enterprise</b> in which there is rapid progress, with something of the delight of creation even for the humblest unit. And in human relations the gain will be just as great as in work. The only human relations that have value are those that are rooted in mutual freedom, where there is no domination and no slavery, no tie except affection, no economic or conventional necessity to preserve the external show when the inner life is dead. One of the most horrible things about commercialism {{is the way in which}} it poisons the relations of men and women. The evils of prostitution are generally recognized, but, great as they are, the effect of economic conditions on marriage seems to me even worse. There is not infrequently, in marriage, a suggestion of purchase, of acquiring a woman on condition of keeping her in a certain standard of material comfort. Often and often, a marriage hardly differs from prostitution except by being harder to escape from. The whole basis of these evils is economic. Economic causes make marriage a matter of bargain and contract, in which affection is quite secondary, and its absence constitutes no recognized reason for liberation. Marriage should be a free, spontaneous meeting of mutual instinct, filled with happiness not unmixed with a feeling akin to awe: it should involve that degree of respect of each for the other that makes even the most trifling interference with liberty an utter impossibility, and a common life enforced by one against the will of the other an unthinkable thing of deep horror. It is not so that marriage is conceived by lawyers who make settlements, or by priests who give the name of ``sacrament'' to an institution which pretends to find something sanctifiable in the brutal lusts or drunken cruelties of a legal husband. It is not in a spirit of freedom that marriage is conceived by most men and women at present: the law makes it an opportunity for indulgence of the desire to interfere, where each submits to some loss of his or her own liberty, for the pleasure of curtailing the liberty of the other. And the atmosphere of private property makes it more difficult than it otherwise would be for any better ideal to take root.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{rationale}} for gradual privatization in transitional economies through studying property rights structures {{and the nature of}} Chinese <b>collective</b> <b>enterprises.</b> First, we pose a puzzle for existing theories of property rights, and then we provide a theoretical model for determining the optimal ownership arrangements for transitional economies. This theory argues that ownership arrangements should be functions of the varying degrees of imperfection of the institutional environment. Hence, <b>collective</b> <b>enterprises</b> actually may dominate private ownership in the middle of transition. Thus, to make the transition process smooth, the economic environment before massive privatization mus...|$|R

In this paper, I argue that the productivity of state and <b>collective</b> owned <b>enterprises</b> to a large extent depends on capacity utilization and the level of aggregated demand.

50|$|During the State-owned Enterprise (SOE) {{reforms of}} the late 1990s, women were laid off in greater numbers and {{experienced}} larger pay cuts than men. Additionally, female-dominated industries such as the textile industry and other light industry were affected greatly by the enterprise reform and economic reform in the 1990s, resulting in the unemployment of many women. Further, employees occupying so called secondary jobs were laid off in greater numbers than those in primary jobs. Since women occupied a high proportion in these secondary jobs, {{they were the first}} to be laid off during the economic downturn. Further, women were forced to retire at a younger age than men. In general the government-mandated retirement age for women was five years younger than that for men, while internal retirement age (determined by individual enterprises) was even lower for women. Lastly, the enterprises that laid off the most workers were those <b>collective</b> <b>enterprises</b> that had poor performance and were unable to survive in the new market economy. These <b>collective</b> <b>enterprises,</b> however, employed larger proportions of women than men. As a result, when the companies went under, larger numbers of women than men were left unemployed.|$|R

It is the first attempt in this literature that tries to identify precisely the effects of specific policies and reforms on health insurance coverage in the transitional period of China. The fixed effects linear model clustering at the province level is used for estimation, and results are compared to alternative models, including pooled OLS, random effects GLS model and fixed effects logit model. Strong empirical evidence is found that unemployment as {{a side effect of}} the Open Door Policy, and the deregulation of SOE and <b>collective</b> <b>enterprises</b> were the main causes for the decreasing trend. For example, urban areas that were highly affected by the Open Door Policy were associated with 17 percentage points decrease in the insurance coverage.
