5|$|Studies of {{rumination}} in {{otherwise healthy}} adults became decreasingly rare {{starting in the}} 1900s, {{and the majority of}} published reports analyzing the syndrome in mentally healthy patients appeared thereafter. At first, adult rumination was described and treated as a benign condition. It is now described as otherwise. While the base of patients to examine has gradually increased as more and more people <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> their symptoms, awareness of the condition by the medical community and the general public is still limited.|$|E

25|$|On October 18, 2017, Maroney {{alleged that}} USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar {{repeatedly}} molested her, starting {{when she was}} 13 years old until her retirement from the sport in 2016.

Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team physician was arrested in November 2016 and accused of sexually assaulting female minors throughout his career.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{an average}} {{reduction}} in deaths in custody since 2004, a 2014 Public Confidence Survey revealed that public satisfaction following {{contact with the}} police was falling {{and that there was}} a greater willingness to complain. The Metropolitan Police, who operate {{in some of the most}} ethnically diverse parts of the UK, received the greatest number of complaints in 2014/15 with 6,828. However, young people and people from black or minority ethic groups were much less likely to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> complaints.|$|E

25|$|Upon meeting up {{with the}} off-duty {{lieutenant}} {{and the woman who}} reported Mixon's current position, Mufarreh didn't believe the latter's credibility as an eyewitness, as she didn't see Mixon directly enter the apartment, and dismissed her statement. However, at the same time, another eyewitness had <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> a valid account of seeing Mixon enter the apartment, although Mufarreh was unaware of that, as he had not reported back to the lieutenant who received the statement. Mufarreh ordered a perimeter to be set up around the apartment, while the first members of the SWAT team arrived at the scene.|$|E
25|$|On 8 October 2003, {{following}} the broadcast of a reconstruction on the BBC's Crimewatch programme, the incident team at Lothian and Borders Police {{received a phone}} call from a man who claimed he was walking near Gosford Bay on the night of the murders, and that he saw a suspicious vehicle. He said it was a works van and it was being driven erratically. The man did not <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> this information during the initial investigation. It was revealed that immediately {{following the}} 2003 Crimewatch broadcast, police had received 130 calls from witnesses who had not previously made themselves known to the investigation.|$|E
25|$|During 2011 the Government again asked suitors to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> {{proposals}} for Northern Rock. On 17 November 2011, {{it was announced}} that Virgin Money were to buy Northern Rock plc for £747 million, with other potential payments of up to £280 million over the next few years. By July 2012 a further £73 million was paid as deferred consideration. W.L. Ross increased his stake in Virgin Money, owning 44% of the combined business by putting £260 million into the deal. Both Abu Dhabi-based Stanhope Investments and Branson's Virgin Group invested £50 million in the Northern Rock deal. In 2014 Virgin Money repaid a further £154.5 million that it had received as part of the refinancing package.|$|E

25|$|Many first-round {{candidates}} {{endorsed the}} second-round candidates, but some made public statements regarding {{the second round}} but did not endorse. Dragan Primorac made several public statements - he initially tried to stay completely neutral, but later released one where he listed some characteristics of the future president that he would want, without naming a candidate, but focusing on the fight against corruption. The reception was mixed – Večernji list said he chose no one, while Jutarnji list said that he chose Josipović, reading between the lines. The Josipović campaign later decided to include Primorac in their endorsement list and Primorac {{did not seem to}} <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> a public rebuttal. On the other hand, Josip Jurčević made a late public statement telling voters to void their ballot.|$|E
25|$|Philip's parents {{appeared}} {{regularly on}} the news and clutched what {{has now become a}} well-recognised picture of a smiling Philip in his Confirmation clothes of a blue jacket and a red rosette. This photo has been deemed a precursor to that of British infant Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal 21 years later. However, the family, unlike the McCanns, have been relatively private about their loss, speaking to the media on only a few occasions in the past 25 years. It has been reported that this is due to several inaccurate reports of the incident of which they have disapproved. Gardaí have, however, praised the media as a proven method for encouraging people to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> further information on the case each time an appeal is broadcast. Residents' organisation ACRA also launched an intense campaign to attempt to find Philip.|$|E
25|$|Prosecutors say {{it sends}} a message {{that no one is}} above the law, and the {{likelihood}} of being perp-walked after arrest deters criminal behavior on the part of offenders, especially white-collar criminals, who might otherwise believe they could successfully avoid conviction. Mary Jo White, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutor's office that handles most crimes committed in the financial sector, believes perp walks in such cases restore investor confidence. Police say that the image of a suspect being taken into custody, when publicized, can encourage other witnesses to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> relevant information. Lastly, prosecutors may be trying to get an advantage in a bail hearing if they consider the defendant to be a flight risk, since it bolsters their case if the defendant apparently had to be arrested.|$|E

25|$|An MP for {{the ruling}} Pakistan Peoples Party, Syed Mumtaz Alam Gillani, has <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> {{testimony}} evidencing a purportedly serious security breach at the Marriott {{on the night}} between 16 and 17 September, several days before the bombing. Alam Gillani and two friends {{are said to have}} witnessed several large steel boxes being unloaded from a U.S. Embassy truck by a group of U.S. Marines and, according to someone at the hotel, transported to the fourth and fifth floors. Among the several people who witnessed this incident was Pakistan Peoples Party leader Sajjad Chaudhry. However, Alam Gilani {{was the only one who}} objected to and protested the apparent security breach taking place, but was met with silence from the American Marines. The hotel security staff did not respond to Alam Gilani's protests as they passively watched what was taking place, not being allowed to go near the boxes by the U.S. Marines. Alam Gilani has since denounced the newspaper account, asserting that he was merely making light conversation with the journalist; the newspaper, however, stands by its account. Pakistani authorities are also investigating this issue.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Silver's mother, Jackie, Naomi {{provides}} Erin with comfort. Soon afterward, Naomi learns the truth about Jen's actions {{on the night of}} the prom, creating a rift between the two. Naomi then offers Annie her apologies. Annie initially keeps her at a distance, while Liam, after much effort, is eventually given a second chance with Naomi. Later, she begins to encounter awkwardness with Liam. After clashing with Mr. Cannon (Hal Ozsan), a faculty member, Naomi falsely accuses him of sexual harassment while talking with her friends, who unexpectedly urge her to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> the experience. As with her attack on Annie, she initially declines to act. However, she eventually does so when Liam faces expulsion for assaulting Cannon. She is later called to testify in front of the school board, which prompts her to reveal the truth. Afterward, Naomi faces new conflicts with her sister Jen, while Liam eventually leaves Naomi upon deciding that their relationship is no longer working. While experiencing trouble with her car one evening, she seeks assistance in school and stumbles upon Mr. Cannon. He kisses Naomi repeatedly as she refuses and pushes him away, but he continues and eventually rapes her.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the four}} copies {{made by the}} Home Army, one, hidden in the {{basement}} of former Arka workers Hanna and Adam Mickiewicz, was accidentally destroyed by Soviet soldiers who were billeted at the Mickiewiczes' home and used the basement as a latrine and waste dump. Another copy was buried in the ground, but soon after the war a housing project was constructed on top of the site. A third copy was burned by its holder who was afraid of being imprisoned if it were found by the Polish Communist Secret Police or the NKVD; during the Stalinist era in Poland, former Home Army were persecuted by the authorities and the microfilm would have been proof that he {{had been a member of}} the organization. The fourth copy survived however, sewn into Hanna's corset and was not found despite several searches of the Mickiewiczes' home and the arrest of Adam (he was released after Stalin's death in 1953 during the resulting period of political liberalization). Based on these experiences Hanna kept the existence of the final microfilm secret for many years, to keep appearances wore the corset in everyday life, and did not <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> the information until after the fall of communism, in 1991. When finally recovered many of the microfilms had sweat stain on them and some were unreadable. The recovery took several years; the first restored documents were not available until 1999.|$|E
