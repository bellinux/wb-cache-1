50|$|The Kingston {{townsite}} was platted on April 24, 1890 by C.C. <b>Calkins</b> and Samuel B. Brierly. <b>Calkins</b> {{dreamed of}} Kingston as a resort town for vacationers from Seattle. <b>Calkins</b> called it The Monterey of Washington. <b>Calkins</b> had drawings and designs for a giant {{hotel on the}} waterfront, with a boat launch, a church on the hill, along with a college. After <b>Calkins</b> and Brierly platted the town, a lower than expected number of people showed up to settle there. <b>Calkins</b> then gave up and left. The town slowly grew, {{but not at the}} pace that <b>Calkins</b> had dreamed.|$|R

25|$|The Calkin–Wilf tree {{is named}} after Neil <b>Calkin</b> and Herbert Wilf, who {{considered}} it in their 2000 paper. The tree was introduced earlier by Jean Berstel and Aldo de Luca as Raney tree, since they drew some ideas from a paper by George N. Raney. Stern's diatomic series was formulated much earlier by Moritz Abraham Stern, a 19th-century German mathematician who also invented the closely related Stern–Brocot tree. Even earlier, a similar tree appears in Kepler's Harmonices Mundi (1619).|$|E
25|$|By 1886, Bogan was in Wyoming {{working for}} the Vorhees Ranch, near Lusk, Wyoming. He {{is known to have}} killed three men by this time, one was the alleged murder of a dance hall {{proprietor}} who prohibited Bogan and his men from ever entering his saloon. Bogan, who have laready taken the alias of Bill Gatlin at that time, still forced his way into the establishment, and when he met the proprietor with a rifle in his hands, Bogan drew his revolver and shot him in cold blood. Bill <b>Calkin,</b> the editor of the local newspaper, wrote that Bogan was possible a cowboy wanted in Texas, and who had gone by at least two other names in the past. Bogan was infuriated, and Bogan set out looking for him, accompanied by cowboy Sterling Balou. The two entered the Cleveland Brothers Saloon, at which point Bogan drew his pistol calling for <b>Calkin,</b> and daring any of his friends to challenge him. One of the Cleveland brothers was able to bring a sawed off shotgun to bear on the two cowboys, and seconds later Constable Charles S. Gunn entered with his own pistol drawn, backing Cleveland. Bogan and Balou retreated and fled.|$|E

50|$|<b>Calkins</b> {{was sold}} on November 15, 1890, and L.B. Hastings became master.

500|$|In August 1957, {{the local}} farmer W. G. Best was {{ploughing}} on his Brenscombe Farm when he uncovered {{a row of}} 23 stones that was situated about [...] west of Rempstone Stone Circle. His son stood most of these into an upright position, to better assist their later removal. The antiquarian J. Bernard <b>Calkin</b> was alerted to the discovery and visited it prior to the stones being removed by the farmer. <b>Calkin</b> noted that the stones were made of local sandstone and were smaller than the stones in the circle, averaging about 2 feet 6 inches by 1 foot 6 inches. He believed {{that they had been}} deliberately lain out in two parallel lines, 3 yards apart and with an interval of five yards between each stone.|$|E
500|$|The {{directing}} of Scott & Bailey {{is undertaken}} in a method whereby [...] "each director directs a 'block' {{of two or}} three episodes, dictated by the schedule– when each episode has finished shooting, the director goes into the edit and a new director takes over for the next block", according to <b>Calkin.</b> The most prolific director of Scott & Bailey is Morag Fullerton, who directed seven episodes.|$|E
50|$|While {{executive}} director of the Hardin County Conservation Board, <b>Calkins</b> had a long-running radio show on radio station KIFG-AM.

500|$|The {{involvement}} of Diane Taylor {{as a consultant}} producer is credited with maintaining Scott & Baileys [...] "rigorous authenticity". According to Jessamy <b>Calkin</b> of The Telegraph, [...] "the attention to detail is more extreme on this series, say many of the crew, than others they have worked on". During the filming of Unforgiven in 2008 (written by Wainwright and also starring Suranne Jones), Wainwright was told to meet Taylor by Grant Montgomery, the show's designer. After meeting, the production was given the green light by ITV and the script was largely re-written, with Wainwright commenting: [...] "I wasn't writing a single line of dialogue that Diane hadn't influenced". Wainwright is responsible for writing the majority of episodes.|$|E

She rebuked <b>Calkin</b> for wanting to deny women political recognition and argued why women should be given the right to vote, and aired her objections to Edith Calkin’s approach to women's rights.|$|E

5000|$|Outside of her {{contributions}} {{to the field of}} psychology, Mary Whiton <b>Calkins</b> was an avid supporter of women's rights. <b>Calkins</b> was a suffragist - active in the fight for women's right to vote, disputing [...] "in a democratic country, governed as this is by the suffrage of its citizens, and given over as this is to the principle and practice of educating women, a distinction based on difference of sex is artificial and illogical". <b>Calkins</b> was a pacifist {{and a member of the}} American Civil Liberties Union. While working at Wellesley around the time of World War I, a colleague of <b>Calkins</b> was fired for holding pacificistic views. <b>Calkins</b> offered her resignation, stating she held the same views as her colleague who was terminated, but her resignation from Wellesley was not accepted by the President or board.|$|R
