In this paper, we provide a simple mathematical model of Memristors characterized by linear dopant drift for sinusoidal input voltage, showing a high matching with the nonlinear SPICE simulations.

2500|$|Davis {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of <b>Critical</b> <b>Resistance,</b> a {{national}} grassroots organization dedicated to building a movement to abolish the prison-industrial complex. In recent works, she has argued that the prison system in the United States more closely resembles a new form of slavery than a criminal justice system. According to Davis, between the late 19th century and the mid-20th century, the number of prisons in the United States sharply increased but crime rates continued to fall. During this time, she argued that racism in American society was demonstrated by the disproportionate share of the African-American population who are incarcerated. [...] "What is effective or just about this [...] "justice" [...] system?" [...] she urged people to question.|$|E
2500|$|In 1926, {{building}} on Hickson's research, Peter Alexander first suggested the bad quarto theory. Alexander agreed with Hickson that A Shrew {{was derived from}} The Shrew, {{but he did not}} agree that Marlowe wrote A Shrew. Instead he labelled A Shrew a bad quarto. His main argument was that, primarily in the subplot of A Shrew, characters act without motivation, whereas such motivation is present in The Shrew. Alexander believed this represents an example of a [...] "reporter" [...] forgetting details and becoming confused, which also explains why lines from other plays are used from time to time; to cover gaps which the reporter knows have been left. He also argued the subplot in The Shrew was closer to the plot of I Suppositi/Supposes than the subplot in A Shrew, which he felt indicated the subplot in The Shrew must have been based directly on the source, whereas the subplot in A Shrew was a step removed. In their 1928 edition of the play for the New Shakespeare, Arthur Quiller-Couch and John Dover Wilson supported Alexander's argument. However, there has always been <b>critical</b> <b>resistance</b> to the theory.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Critical</b> <b>Resistance</b> (CR) {{was formed}} in 1997 to {{challenge}} the idea that incarceration can solve all social problems. Angela Davis, Rose Braz, Ruth Wilson Gilmore and other activists founded CR to challenge the issue of mass incarceration and policing. On September 25-27, 1998, <b>Critical</b> <b>Resistance</b> held its first conference at the University of California, Berkeley. This conference challenged the phenomenon {{now known as the}} prison industrial complex (PIC). <b>Critical</b> <b>Resistance</b> says that the government has commodified prisons as desirable and, in return, gained public support to expand prisons. As certain groups of people are criminalized, such as racial minorities, the working class, and immigrants, they are incarcerated and become disenfranchised. CR’s initial international conference put the term “prison-industrial complex” on the national agenda with the goal of re-informing and re-educating the American public to stop mass incarceration. [...] CR’s mission statement supports abolishing the PIC and the idea that capitalism profits from incarceration, a reason for the dramatic increase in the incarceration of people of color, women, and the poor.|$|E

The process was optimized aiming to achieve the ultra-thin films with a Tc {{in the order of}} bulk value keeping them homogenous and smooth. The inhomogeneity and high roughness of films can significantly affect the HEB mixers performance if they are scaling down to submicron dimensions, e. g. by reduction of Tc or increase of device resistance and consequently mismatch with antenna.

40|$|The general {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to investigate the electrical and thermal characteristics of the TOPAZ-ll thermionic fuel element (TFE) test stand which allows testing of a single TFE. Detailed cross sectional drawings have been developed and a one dimensional network has been created {{for use in a}} thermal model of the FTE test stand. <b>Critical</b> <b>resistances</b> in the network are identified as the regulated helium gap, the cesium filled interelectrode gap and the cooling water channel. Experimental data show the FTE operational dependence upon cesium pressure in the interelectrode gap. Thermionic performance at varying thermal input power levels has been analyzed based on the determined optimal cesium pressures which range from 0. 4 torr at about 1000 Watts to 1 torr at about 3000 Watts input. Thermionic efficiencies can be as high as 7 %, but the low thermal inputs have efficiencies of about 1. 5 %. Results provided by the FTE test stand are compared to the TOPAZ-II reactor system performance. Operation of the reactor at much lower thermal power (not previously analyzed) may produce useful electrical output (1 kilowatt-electric) for "housekeeping" purposes. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S.

40|$|Resistance to {{antimicrobial}} agents undermines {{our ability to}} treat bacterial infections. It attracts intense media and political interest and impacts on personal health and costs to health infrastructures. Bacteria have developed resistance to all licensed antibacterial agents, {{and their ability to}} become resistant to unlicensed agents is often demonstrated during the development process. Conventional approaches to antimicrobial development, involving modification of existing agents or production of synthetic derivatives, are unlikely to deliver the range or type of drugs that will be needed to meet all future requirements. Although many companies are seeking novel targets, further radical approaches to both antimicrobial design and the reversal of resistance are now urgently required. In this article, we discuss 'antisense' (or 'antigene') strategies to inhibit resistance mechanisms at the genetic level. These offer an innovative approach to a global problem and could be used to restore the efficacy of clinically proven agents. Moreover, this strategy has the potential to overcome <b>critical</b> <b>resistances,</b> not only in the so-called 'superbugs' (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci and multidrug-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), but in resistant strains of any bacterial species...|$|R
