50|$|The {{matter was}} {{referred}} to the Constitutional <b>Court</b> <b>by</b> the High <b>Court</b> for confirmation of its order declaring {{the decision of the}} President to bring the Act into force null and void. The Constitutional Court, in a unanimous decision delivered by Chaskalson P, confirmed the order of the Transvaal High Court, but gave reasons that were {{different from those of the}} High Court. Two issues had to be decided <b>by</b> the <b>Court.</b> The first was whether or not the High Court’s order, setting aside the President’s decision, was a finding of “constitutional invalidity” that required <b>confirmation</b> <b>by</b> the Constitutional <b>Court</b> under section 172(2) of the Constitution. If so, the second issue was whether the President’s decision to bring the Act into force was constitutionally valid or not.|$|R
5000|$|In their ruling, {{the judges}} {{said they were}} {{satisfied}} that the book {{was a piece of}} responsible journalism, that McLagan had taken steps to verify the story and that [...] "as a result of his honesty, his expertise on the subject, his careful research and his painstaking evaluation of a mass of material, the book was protected." [...] Caroline Kean, McLagan's solicitor, called the ruling [...] "ground-breaking and momentous", and said: [...] "This is an unambiguous <b>confirmation</b> <b>by</b> the <b>Court</b> of Appeal that Reynolds is alive and kicking. It is not limited to newspapers, it means all media and there is no time constraint. It applies equally to a book and, by analogy, it will apply to a film or a TV programme, providing it is something of proper public interest and a journalist has done his very best to act in the course of responsible journalism." ...|$|R
5000|$|Women in Malaysia have {{restrictions}} in marriage, {{although some of}} their rights are protected. Under the Islamic Family Law, the wife's maintenance by her husband is conditioned by her obedience. Art. 59(2) states that: [...] "2) Subject to Hukum Syarak and <b>confirmation</b> <b>by</b> the <b>Court,</b> a wife shall not be entitled to maintenance when she is nusyuz or unreasonably refuses to obey the lawful wishes or commands of her husband, that is to say, inter alia - (a) when she withholds her association with her husband; (b) when she leaves her husband’s home against his will; or (c) when she refuses to move with him to another home or place, without any valid reason according to Hukum Syarak. However, some rights of the wife (in regard to property, court cases, and bank accounts) are protected by the Married Women Act, 1957 (Act. 450), at Art. 4 - Capacity of married women.|$|R

40|$|This paper synthesizes <b>confirmation</b> <b>by</b> {{instances}} and <b>confirmation</b> <b>by</b> successful predictions, {{and thereby}} the Hempelian and the hypothetico-deductive traditions in confirmation theory.

We compare our proposal to rivalling suggestions and discuss its merits and drawbacks, especially vis-à-vis Bayesianism...|$|R
