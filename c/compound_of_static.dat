40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a tactile sensor using piezoresistive beams for {{detection}} of the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>static</b> friction merely by pressing the sensor against an object. The sensor chip is composed of three pairs of piezoresistive beams arranged in parallel and embedded in an elastomer; this sensor is able to measure the vertical and lateral strains of the elastomer. The coefficient <b>of</b> <b>static</b> friction is estimated from {{the ratio of the}} fractional resistance changes corresponding to the sensing elements of vertical and lateral strains when the sensor is in contact with an object surface. We applied a normal force on the sensor surface through objects with coefficients <b>of</b> <b>static</b> friction ranging from 0. 2 to 1. 1. The fractional resistance changes corresponding to vertical and lateral strains were proportional to the applied force. Furthermore, the relationship between these responses changed according to the coefficients <b>of</b> <b>static</b> friction. The experimental result indicated the proposed sensor could determine the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>static</b> friction before a global slip occurs...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{accurate}} measurement [1] [2] <b>of</b> <b>static</b> potentials between {{sources in}} various SU(3) representations provides a crucial {{test of the}} QCD vacuum and of different theoretical approaches to the confinement.

The {{magnetic}} and {{dielectric properties}} of the Ni 2 FeV 3 O 11 -δ compound synthesized using different annealing routes have been studied by means <b>of</b> <b>static</b> magnetization, electron paramag-netic resonance and dielectric spectroscopy. The temperature dependence of the magnetic sus-ceptibility has shown marked singularities due to the coexistence of many kinds of magnetic inter-actions. Dielectric measurements have shown a second order phase transition to the ferroelectric state at about 200 K. Dielectric loss measurements have shown an intense peak at the same temperature with activation energy of about 0. 42 eV. All investigated <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the M-Fe-V-O (M=Ni, Zn, Mg) system have displayed a slight anomaly of the EPR parameters at about 200 K.
