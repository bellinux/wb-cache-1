50|$|Most buttercreams {{can be left}} at room {{temperature}} without melting. Buttercreams made with shortening and a higher sugar content withstand warmer temperatures better than those made solely with butter. Cooling buttercream causes it to harden.

40|$|The {{process of}} cocoa paste {{pressing}} has a function {{to separate the}} fatty component of cocoa from its cake. Cocoa paste is further processed into cocoa powder using grinding machine for cocoa <b>cake.</b> The <b>cooled</b> cone type of cocoa grinding machine is used {{to solve the problem}} of plug in the maschine caused by melting of fat in cocoa cake due to hot effect as a result of friction in the grinding machine. Grinding machine of cocoa has conical form of cylinder for grinding and stator wall wrapped by source of cold and closed with jacket wool. Research was conducted at Kaliwining Experimental Garden of Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI) using cocoa cake containing 26. 75 % originated from Forastero type of cocoa seed. The capacity and recovery of the machine was influenced by space between rotor cylinder and stator wall. Grinding machine operated at cooling temperature of 25. 5 o C and space between rotor – stator 0. 9 cm and the capacity of 187. 5 kg/hour with recovery of 200 mesh cocoa powder as much as 24 %. The maximum  power of machine required  was 2. 5 kW with efficiency of  energy transfer of 97 %. Results of proximate analysis showed that there was no change of protein content, but protein and carbohydrate content increased after processing, i. e. from 5. 70 % and 59. 82 % into 5. 80 % and 61. 89 % respectively.

5000|$|Before {{the cooked}} <b>cake</b> has <b>cooled,</b> {{it is still}} flexible. This allows the {{creation}} of rolled cakes such as the Swiss roll.

[...] In addition, the foam cake technique is used in angel food cake (where only egg whites are used) [...] and some recipes for Belgian waffles (where the egg whites are separated from the yolks and folded into the batter at the end of preparation).|$|R
5000|$|I {{have a few}} {{problems}} with Robin and Katherine romanceas a whole. First, isnt Desperate Housewives supposed to be all family- and Midwestern mom-friendly?

Among viewers between ages 18 and 49, it received a 3.6 rating/9 share, which at the time was the lowest rating for an individual episode of Desperate Housewives in series history. This continued a downward trend in the ratings for the show: each of the previous three episodes had been the lowest rated in series history until the airing of the next episode in the subsequent week. [...] "The Chase" [...] dropped in viewership three percent from the previous episode, [...] "Lovely". Like that episode, [...] "The Chase" [...] suffered in the ratings partially due to competition from the NBC broadcast of the 2010 Winter Olympics, which drew an estimated 21.3 million viewers. Desperate Housewives was also outperformed by the CBS reality series Undercover Boss which, in its fourth episode, drew 15.15 million viewers.|$|R

50|$|Angel food <b>cakes</b> are <b>cooled</b> upside down. Some tube pans have “feet” or “fingers” {{that extend}} {{off of the}} top rim of the pan. The “feet” are placed on a cooling rack. If the pan does not have “feet” it is {{customary}} for home bakers to place a glass soda bottle or something similar through the tube {{to ensure that the}} pan is elevated. The elevation provides sufficient air flow to the cake, so that it cools properly. If a non-stick pan or greased pan were used, the cake would fall out when inverted, leading to a collapsed cake.|$|R

5000|$|It was a {{convention}} of obscenely comic verse that oral sex caused bad breath that was nearly toxic. [...] "Whores of the alleyways" [...] are contaminated from giving oral sex; Catullus refers to [...] "the foul saliva of a pissed-over whore." [...] The urinary function of the penis makes oral sex particularly repulsive to Catullus, who elsewhere reviles a Celtiberian for brushing his teeth in urine. Martial jokes that a fine perfume turned to garum, fish sauce, when it was sniffed by a man whose breath was putrid from oral sex. In another of Martial's epigrams, a fellator breathes on a hot <b>cake</b> to <b>cool</b> it down and turns it to excrement. The bad breath and rotten teeth that are attributed to performing oral sex represent moral decay and a general corruption of the mouth's positive functions as the organ of a citizen's persuasive speech.|$|R

The mixed material was shaped {{in the form of}} a cake and left for one hour for the gel to set. The cakes were then steamed. The <b>cooled</b> <b>cakes</b> were cut into pieces of 1 cm length x 1 cm width x 0. 5 cm thick. The pieces were either dried in an electrical oven at 50 °C or dried in sun to a moisture content of 11 - 12 %. Biochemical, bacteriological and organoleptic evaluation revealed that the cakes were in very good acceptable form for 8 months. The cakes could be rehydrated by soaking in water at ambient temperature for half an hour and boiling in water for 10 minutes...|$|R
5000|$|The album {{received}} a review from David Jeffries of AllMusic. David Jeffries responded, [...] "Few mainstream artists {{can keep the}} lazy release schedule Don Hathaway's daughter does and retain a strong fan base. It's been a whole decade since Lalah Hathaway released {{one of her own}} albums and half that long since she joined Joe Sample for The Song Lives On. It's her warm voice, smooth delivery, and allegiance to fad-free R&B that keeps the faithful patiently waiting. Delivering on all counts, Outrun the Sky is a fan's dream and the singer's best showcase since her debut. While The Song Lives On was more ambitious and in turn brought more fans, Outrun the Sky is a better showcase. Not only does Hathaway cover a wider spectrum of tones and moods but she also producers and writes most of the highlights of the album. Her stream-of-consciousness lyrics for the title track give a more personal picture of the artist and paint her as an approachable dreamer who's as unsure as anyone. Hathaway's inspired writing is responsible for many of the other warm and reflective winners but it's the closing [...] "Boston" [...] that best illustrates how this husky voiced siren can conjure up a cosmopolitan song and deliver it with heart. Including her smoky take on Luther Vandross' [...] "Forever, for Always, for Love" [...] from the Forever, for Always, for Luther tribute is the icing on this <b>cool</b> <b>cake.</b> The ballad-heavy album still has its fair share of grooves that are rooted in R&B but the overall easy temperament isn't going to alienate any of Hathaway's smooth jazz converts. Nice to have her back; here's to a shorter wait next time." ...|$|R
