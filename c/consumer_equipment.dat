5|$|The {{most common}} type is the live bootleg, or {{audience}} recording, which is created with sound recording equipment smuggled into a live concert. Many artists and live venues prohibit this form of recording, but from the 1970s onwards the increased availability of portable technology made such bootlegging easier, and the general quality of these recordings has improved over time as <b>consumer</b> <b>equipment</b> becomes sophisticated. A number of bootlegs originated with FM radio broadcasts of live or previously recorded live performances. Other bootlegs may be soundboard recordings taken directly from a multi-track mixing console used to feed the public address system at a live performance. Artists may record their own shows for private review, but engineers may surreptitiously take a copy of this, which ends up being shared. As a soundboard recording is intended to supplement the natural acoustics of a gig, a bootleg may have an inappropriate mix of instruments, unless the gig is so large that everything needs to be amplified {{and sent to the}} desk.|$|E

25|$|By {{the mid-1970s}} the only {{stations}} broadcasting in black-and-white {{were a few}} high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, {{and a handful of}} low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color and by the early 1980s, B sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or use as video monitor screens in lower-cost <b>consumer</b> <b>equipment.</b> By the late 1980s, even those areas switched to color sets.|$|E
2500|$|A {{thermal fuse}} is {{often found in}} <b>consumer</b> <b>equipment</b> such as coffee makers, hair dryers or {{transformers}} powering small consumer electronics devices. [...] They contain a fusible, temperature-sensitive composition which holds a spring contact mechanism normally closed. When the surrounding temperature gets too high, the composition melts and allows the spring contact mechanism to break the circuit. The device {{can be used to}} prevent a fire in a hair dryer for example, by cutting off the power supply to the heater elements when the air flow is interrupted (e.g., the blower motor stops or the air intake becomes accidentally blocked). Thermal fuses are a 'one shot', non-resettable device which must be replaced once they have been activated (blown).|$|E

2500|$|Political {{support of}} the {{terrestrial}} digital television network was controversial. Opponents stated that the frequencies would be better applied to providing wireless broadband; however as most other countries use these frequencies for television, little <b>consumer</b> <b>equipment</b> would have support for such use. Proponents stated that a digital television network would be {{the easiest way to}} carry out the digital television transition and that it would allow the population to receive NRK without having go have an agreement with a commercial company. [...] The long political precessing time resulted in that MPEG-4 could be used for compression, allowing for more channels and better quality, and that all home boxes can support high definition.|$|E

SDI and HD-SDI are usually available only in professional video equipment because various licensing agreements restrict the use of unencrypted digital interfaces, such as SDI, prohibiting their use in <b>consumer</b> <b>equipment.</b> Several professional video and HD-video capable DSLR cameras and all uncompressed video capable consumer cameras use the HDMI interface, often called clean HDMI. There are various mod kits for existing DVD players and other devices, which allow a user to add a serial digital interface to these devices.|$|E
