5|$|The {{film was}} re-released in 1985 and 2002, earning another $60 million and $68 million respectively, for a {{worldwide}} total of $792 million with North America accounting for $435 million. It held the global record {{until it was}} surpassed by Jurassic Park—another Spielberg-directed film—in 1993, although it managed {{to hold on to}} the domestic record for a further four years, where a Star Wars reissue reclaimed it. It was eventually released on VHS and laserdisc on October 27, 1988; to combat piracy, the tapeguards and tape hubs on the videocassettes were colored green, the tape itself was affixed with a small, holographic sticker of the 1963 Universal logo (much like the holograms on a <b>credit</b> <b>card),</b> <b>and</b> encoded with Macrovision. In North America alone, VHS sales came to $75 million. In 1991, Sears began selling E.T. videocassettes exclusively at their stores as part of a holiday promotion. It was reissued on VHS and Laserdisc again in 1996. The Laserdisc included a 90-minute documentary. Produced and directed by Laurent Bouzereau, it included interviews with Spielberg, producer Kathleen Kennedy, composer John Williams and other cast and crew members. It also included two theatrical trailers, an isolated music score, deleted scenes, and still galleries. The VHS included a 10-minute version of the same documentary from the Laserdisc.|$|E

50|$|Historically <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> {{processing}} {{services were}} supplied by banks that {{were members of}} the Visa or MasterCard networks. Typically banks both issued <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> <b>and</b> helped merchants process them, but over time the industry consolidated. Now, very few banks issue <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> <b>and</b> the industry is dominated by a few large issuers - Elavon, Citibank, Capital One, MBNA / Bank of America, and Chase. Even fewer banks process <b>credit</b> <b>cards.</b> Banks found that it was not within their skillset to convince every small merchant to accept <b>credit</b> <b>cards,</b> <b>and</b> they began to outsource the selling of such services to small companies called ISOs (Independent Sales Organizations). They also found that massive scale helped reduce the cost of processing <b>credit</b> <b>cards,</b> so they began to outsource processing to a few giant processors including Elavon, TSYS, First Data and MSI.|$|R

25|$|In the United States until 1984, {{federal law}} {{prohibited}} surcharges on card transactions. Although the federal Truth in Lending Act provisions that prohibited surcharges expired that year, {{a number of}} states have since enacted laws that continue to outlaw the practice; California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maine, New York, Oklahoma, and Texas have laws against surcharges. As of 2006, the United States probably had one of the world's highest if not the top ratio of credit cards per capita, with 984 million bank-issued Visa and MasterCard <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>and</b> debit card accounts alone for an adult population of roughly 220 million people.

25|$|In 1996, Madison, Wisconsin, instituted its Red Bikes Project, {{a public}} bike sharing program. These red-painted {{bicycles}} {{were available for}} the use of the general public, primarily in the student areas of State Street between the University of Wisconsin campus and the Wisconsin State Capitol. Initially, the only rule regarding the use of a Red Bikes Project bicycle was that it was required to remain outside and unlocked, and thus available for any passerby. After a surge in bicycle thefts and vandalism, the program was modified to require a valid <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>and</b> $80 in security deposits for both the bicycle and the now-mandatory bicycle lock. The program is now only available seasonally, from spring (when all snow has melted) to 30 November.|$|E
25|$|To access a {{financial}} institution's online banking facility, a customer with internet access {{will need to}} register with the institution for the service, {{and set up a}} password and other credentials for customer verification. The credentials for online banking is normally not the same as for telephone or mobile banking. Financial institutions now routinely allocate customers numbers, whether or not customers have indicated an intention to access their online banking facility. Customer numbers are normally not the same as account numbers, because a number of customer accounts can be linked to the one customer number. Technically, the customer number can be linked to any account with the financial institution that the customer controls, though the financial institution may limit the range of accounts that may be accessed to, say, cheque, savings, loan, <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>and</b> similar accounts.|$|E

25|$|In October 2017, the MTA started {{installing}} eTix-compatible {{electronic ticketing}} turnstiles in 14 stations in Manhattan. The eTix system, already {{used on the}} Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad, allows passengers to pay their fares using their phones. The system would originally be for MTA employees only. On October 23, 2017, {{it was announced that}} the MetroCard would be phased out and replaced by a contactless fare payment system also by Cubic, with fare payment being made using Apple Pay, Google Wallet, debit/credit cards with near-field communication enabled, or radio-frequency identification cards. The October 23 announcement calls for the expansion of this system to a general-use electronic fare payment system at 500 subway turnstiles and 600 buses by late 2018, with all buses and subway stations using electronic fare collection by 2020. However, support of the MetroCard is slated to remain until 2023. The unnamed replacement fare system has been criticized because the new turnstiles could be hacked, thereby leaving <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>and</b> phone information vulnerable to theft.|$|E
