40|$|This {{research}} unpacks {{the assumption}} that students understand research in the discipline of fashion textiles in a unitary and unproblematic way. It {{is one of the}} first empirical studies to examine learning from <b>a</b> phenomenographic <b>research</b> perspective in this particular discipline and is a result of reanalysing data collected for a previous study (Drew, Bailey and Shreeve 2001, 2002). The research question in this case was to ask what were the qualitatively different ways in which students in fashion textiles project work approached the research component of the project? The paper is published in ADCHE, a peer reviewed journal and has been cited by Biddle-Perry. The study led on to further work in the phenomenographic tradition, with <b>a</b> small <b>research</b> grant from the ADC-LTSN being awarded to look at student conceptions of assessment using learning outcomes in the design project. Although phenomenography as <b>a</b> <b>research</b> method is widely known and the outcomes of it inform learning and teaching in higher education (eg Marton and Saljo 1984, Prosser and Trigwell 1997) to such an extent that deep and surface learning has been accused of hegemonic status by Haggis (2004), there have been few applications of this research approach in art and design. It <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> rigorous <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> (Kerlind 2005) and the study of approaches to learning in practice based subjects (eg Drew et al 2001, 2002, Case and Marshall 2004) highlights the need to contribute an art and design perspectives to mainstream debates on learning in text based academic disciplines in order to fully understand different and more widespread learning and teaching practices...|$|R
40|$|La notion de « système » est largement utilisée dans le domaine des {{relations}} industrielles, et cela, depuis fort longtemps. Elle implique un mode de reconstitution de la réalité différent de l'approche causale linéaire sur laquelle se fonde la méthodologie de la recherche empirique. Au lieu d'accentuer les différences entre ces deux modes de réflexion, les auteurs de cet article tentent de démontrer qu'ils sont complémentaires pour l'acquisition des connaissances dans le domaine des sciences humaines. In {{the field}} on human sciences, the researcher is constantly faced with numerous and difficult methodological problems. Moreover, the methods and techniques, on which he can count, often come from other disciplines and their application to human sciences is not without creating some difficulties. Particularly {{in the case of}} human sciences one can notice in the passed years, the proliferation of a certain literature said to be « systemic ». Such a situation interested the researchers of those fields who, generally, must cope with very complex phenomena and, consequently, are in search of methods better adapted to their problems and capable of maintaining a high degree of scientific exactness. However, a survey of this literature is worrysome. Beside the writing of which only the title is systemic, it is remarkable to notice the atmosphere of near-religion surrounding this literature: the reader has the impression to be in presence of a second« Discours de la Méthode ». This type of pro-systemic literature has raised many categorical antagonists (D. C. Phillips, 1969, 1972; F. Thayer, 1972). This literature is criticized because of its unpreciseness, its prejudice toward the scientific method, the low predictive value of the models conceived from the approach explosed in this literature. Some will even pretend that the Systems approach has nothing to offer that has not been already offered by the scientific method. Is the traditional scientific method obsolete? Is it opposed to the Systems approach? If such is the case, where can we find such an opposition? On the other hand, if there is no real opposition between those two approaches, is it possible that they could be complementary and/or have specific fields of application? Such questions are at the origin of this paper. This paper does not pretend to give a complete and definitive answer to those questions. It merely tries to gather around two main topics (The concept of « connection » and of « reconstruction of reality ») some elements of an answer scattered throughout literature. Moreover, an analysis of the complementarity of the two approaches is made {{with the help of a}} model inspired from cognitive psychology. The scientific method is born from the preoccupation of certain men facing a mode of knowledge acquisition favoring almost exclusively exploration and cristalisation, using a mode of knowledge transmission based on intellectual authoritarianism. The mode of acquisition of this era (and this was the problem facing Descartes) abandoned the rigour of the realisation and specification phases. The scientific method has had so much success (the theories were so numerous), that, for a long time, we mingled scientific method with method of acquisition of knowledge. This fashion for Systems approach anses from the necessity to take up, in a rigourous manner, the study of the first two dimensions of the cognitive process. Without a well devined System and a verifiable structure, a verification method loses its meaning. We must notice the fact that many of the supporters of the Systems approach were recruited in some new scientific fields, where phenomena are highly complex and finalised. These scientists were forced to acknowledge the limits of the scientific method. According to us, the Systems approach completes the scientific method. On one hand, it enlarges the universe of the phenomena that could be studied; on the other hand, it furnishes the descriptive tools permitting the formulation of a frame of reference for the investigated problems. The Systems approach <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> serious effort, while still unperfect, to develop a method of exploration. The scientific method and the Systems approach, together, <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> which, for the first time, matches the totality of the steps of the cognitive process...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to build on Dumay and Cai's (2014) prior <b>research</b> to provide <b>a</b> deeper {{analysis}} of the problems associated with using content analysis (CA) as <b>a</b> <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> for investigating intellectual capital disclosure (ICD). Design/methodology/approach: Totally, 110 articles utilising CA as <b>a</b> <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> for inquiring into ICD are analysed based on Krippendorff's (2013) conceptual CA research framework and design logic, and tied into issues relating to CA as <b>a</b> <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> for investigating ICD. Findings: The authors advocate that ICD CA researchers need to go back to the drawing board and ensure that future studies rigorously apply the basic logic of CA design. In its current state, ICD CA research needs to take a few steps back, before it can move forward. If ICD CA researchers can accomplish this, then there is an opportunity to undertake rigorous research to develop reliable and valid outputs that add to new knowledge about IC. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations of the research are the chosen sample of CA-based ICD articles and the adoption of the Krippendorff's framework. However, the authors have identified the main corpus of CA-based ICD studies and since Krippendorff is the only recognised comprehensive text on CA as a methodology, the authors use the most appropriate data and framework possible for the analysis. Originality/value: Prior CA studies have laid the foundation for what is <b>a</b> popular <b>research</b> <b>methodology.</b> However, the authors argue that the popularity of CA as <b>a</b> <b>research</b> method for investigating ICD has become so great that at times the <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> "drives the <b>research</b> questions" as opposed to the "research questions driving the methodology" Hence, this research examines reasons for CA limited contemporary contribution and recommends how this may be overcome rather than prescribing how to conduct ICD CA research. 35 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review and {{critique}} the current status of content analysis (CA) as <b>a</b> <b>research</b> method for inquiring into intellectual capital disclosure (ICD) to determine if CA has a continued role to play in developing new intellectual capital (IC) knowledge. Design/methodology/approach – In all, 110 articles utilising CA as <b>a</b> <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> for inquiring into ICD are analysed. The research is developed in line with other articles critically investigating IC research conducted by Guthrie et al. (2012), Dumay and Garanina (2013) and Dumay (2014). To help understand the impact of CA research articles, the data set is supplemented by including citation data from Google Scholar. The authors also differentiate the paper from other IC research reviews by critically examining the findings and implications of the articles analysed. Findings – The authors do not hold a very positive view on future research which does not substantially depart from the plethora of articles examining ICD using annual reports as a data source or who do not in some way radically change the approach. The authors are of the view that early research into ICD using CA as a methodology was warranted because there was little knowledge about the pattern of IC disclosure in annual reports and other possible ICD forms. However, the research into ICD using annual reports and other data sources has added little more than prove that companies are unwilling to publicly disclose IC to their stakeholders. While the authors do not hold a positive view on future CA research based on annual reports, the authors do hold out hope that researchers will transform their understanding and application of CA as <b>a</b> <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> and offer one example of how this might be achieved. Originality/value – The paper presents a comprehensive critical review of published articles utilising CA as <b>a</b> <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> for inquiring into ICD along with measuring the impact of the articles using citation data from Google Scholar. Hence, the research and its impacts are simultaneously assessed offering insights into the future role that CA as <b>a</b> <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> has to play in developing new IC knowledge. 27 page(s...|$|R
