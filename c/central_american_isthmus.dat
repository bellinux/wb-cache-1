Some Nahuan groups migrated south along the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>isthmus,</b> reaching as far as Nicaragua.

5|$|The conquistadors {{were all}} volunteers, the {{majority}} of whom did not receive a fixed salary but instead {{a portion of the}} spoils of victory, in the form of precious metals, land grants and provision of native labour. Many of the Spanish were already experienced soldiers who had previously campaigned in Europe. A sizeable portion of the Spanish conquistadors were from the southwestern regions of Spain, with their origins in Andalusia and Extremadura. Up to 1519, according to licenses issued in Spain, over half were from these two regions. From 1520 to 1539, this fell to just under half of all conquistadors leaving Spain. The conquest of the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>isthmus</b> was launched from three directions; Mexico, Panama, and the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Relations between rival conquistadors were dominated by mutual distrust, greed, and envy.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} now {{incorporated into}} El Salvador was not politically unified {{at the time}} of Spanish contact. As with neighbouring regions, this hindered the progress of incorporation into the Spanish Empire, as each small kingdom had to be overcome in turn; this contrasted with Mexico where a large empire had been rapidly overcome with the fall of its capital, Tenochtitlan. As Spanish authority gradually spread out from Mexico and Panama, this left El Salvador in an intermediate region temporarily beyond Spanish control. Spanish colonial towns were founded according to the whim of individual conquistadors, with no formal planning of their location or of communication routes between them, often leaving them isolated. In 1548, El Salvador was formally placed within the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, which extended along the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>isthmus</b> from Chiapas, now in southern Mexico, to Costa Rica.|$|E
50|$|In {{an effort}} {{to inform the public}} and {{conserve}} the seals, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries Service developed a historical timeline to demonstrate that the Hawaiian islands has been home to the seals for millions of years and that the seals belong there. Evidence points to monk seals migrating to Hawaii between 4-11 million years ago (mya) through an open water passage between North and South America called the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> Seaway. The <b>Isthmus</b> of Panama closed the Seaway approximately 3 million years ago.|$|R
5|$|The Hawaiian monk seal, as {{the name}} suggests, lives solely in the Hawaiian archipelago. Monk seals {{migrated}} to Hawaii between 4–11 million years ago (mya) through an open water passage between North and South America called the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> Seaway. The <b>Isthmus</b> of Panama closed the Seaway approximately 3 million years ago. The species may have evolved in the Pacific or Atlantic, but in either case, came to Hawaii long before the first Polynesians. When monk seals are not hunting or eating, they generally bask on the beaches; Hawaiian monk seals tend to bask on sandy beaches and volcanic rock of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.|$|R

40|$|The <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> (CA) <b>isthmus</b> {{consists}} of seven countries including Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama, {{some of the}} poorest countries in the world. Over the past twenty years, CA has made good progress in improving the health status of their populations. Analysis of the peer-reviewed literature, as well as national and international reports show that life expectancy at birth has increased and child mortality rates have fallen. Maternal mortality ratios (MMR) have declined by approximately 33 %, however the MMRs for indigenous women remain at unacceptable levels. Despite the advances, made in many CA countries, the overall health status remains well below Latin American averages. In fact, in most CA countries, poor health outcomes are increasingly concentrated geographically among the poor and indigenous populations. Considering indigenous people make up the second largest population group in CA, any improvements in healthcare should significantly improve the health statistics for these countries. For these populations, the integration of local cultural practices and traditional healing methods with modern medicine and healthcare facilities is critical for acceptance. Investigations and analyses of local cultures, knowledge and traditional medicine practices {{should be used to}} determine the factors that contribute to poor health in these populations. Local health educational programs are needed, especially those that would involve men (spouses), families and entire communities. Furthermore, manywomen’s reproductive issues still need to be addressed, particularly those that focus specifically on maternal mortality and cancer. For reductions in maternal mortality, El Salvador and Costa Rica may be good examples to follow. Access to inexpensive (or free) healthcare that is culturally sensitive and community based, particularly for indigenous women, would greatly improve the overall health. The major stumbling blocks to progress are that the funding for programs to reduce maternal mortality is woefully inadequate and that {{there has not been a}} focus on improving healthcare for indigenous women.
