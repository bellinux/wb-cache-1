5|$|Several genera of teleosts have {{independently}} developed air-breathing capabilities, {{and some}} have become amphibious. Some <b>combtooth</b> <b>blennies</b> emerge to feed on land, and freshwater eels are able to absorb oxygen through damp skin. Mudskippers can remain out of water for considerable periods, exchanging gases through skin and mucous membranes in the mouth and pharynx. Swamp eels have similar well-vascularised mouth-linings, and can remain out of water for days and go into a resting state (aestivation) in mud. The anabantoids have developed an accessory breathing structure known as the labyrinth organ on the first gill arch and this is used for respiration in air, and airbreathing catfish have a similar suprabranchial organ. Certain other catfish, such as the Loricariidae, are able to respire through air held in their digestive tracts.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{geographic}} situation of Tenerife, the island enjoys {{an abundance of}} fish of various kinds. The species that are consumed the most are the <b>Combtooth</b> <b>blennies</b> (viejas), as well as sea bream (sama), red porgy (bocinegro), gold lined bream (salema), grouper (mero), and various and abundant types of Thunnus. The Atlantic mackerel (caballa), sardine (sardine), and Jack mackerels (chicharros) are also consumed frequently. Moray eels (morenas) are also eaten, usually fried. Most seafood is cooked simply, usually boiled, or prepared [...] "a la espalda" [...] (cut into two equally shaped pieces along the spine) or [...] "a la sal" [...] (baked in salt). These dishes are usually accompanied by mojo (a local sauce) and wrinkly potatoes.|$|E
