5|$|Boy Scouting uses {{a series}} of medals and patches as emblems. The badge for the Scout rank {{consists}} of a simple fleur-de-lis, which symbolizes a <b>compass</b> <b>needle.</b> The needle points the Scout in the right direction, which is onward and upward. The Tenderfoot badge takes the fleur-de-lis of the Scout badge and adds two stars and an eagle with an American shield. The stars symbolize truth and knowledge; the eagle and shield symbolize freedom and readiness to defend it. The Second Class badge features a scroll inscribed with the Scout Motto, with the ends turned up and a knotted rope hanging from the bottom. The knot reminds each Scout to remember the Scout slogan, and the upturned ends of the scroll symbolize cheerfulness in service. The First Class badge combines {{the elements of the}} Tenderfoot and Second Class badges. For years, the First Class badge was used as the emblem of the BSA. Star has a First Class symbol on a five-pointed yellow star, and initially indicated the five merit badges required to earn the rank. Life has a First Class emblem on a red heart, and initially symbolized the first-aid and health-related merit badges that the rank required. Now it signifies that the ideals of Scouting have {{become a part of the}} Scout's life and character.|$|E

25|$|True north, concept of: The Song Dynasty (9601279) {{official}} Shen Kuo (10311095), {{alongside his}} colleague Wei Pu, improved the orifice {{width of the}} sighting tube to make nightly accurate records of the paths of the moon, stars, and planets in the night sky, for a continuum of five years. By doing so, Shen fixed the outdated position of the pole star, which had shifted over the centuries since the time Zu Geng (fl. 5th century) had plotted it; {{this was due to}} the precession of the Earth's rotational axis. When making the first known experiments with a magnetic compass, Shen Kuo wrote that the needle always pointed slightly east rather than due south, an angle he measured which is now known as magnetic declination, and wrote that the <b>compass</b> <b>needle</b> in fact pointed towards the magnetic north pole instead of true north (indicated by the current pole star); this was a critical step in the history of accurate navigation with a compass.|$|E

500|$|Ørsted's {{discovery}} in 1821 that {{a magnetic field}} existed around all sides of a wire carrying an electric current {{indicated that there was}} a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. Moreover, the interaction seemed different from gravitational and electrostatic forces, the two forces of nature then known. The force on the <b>compass</b> <b>needle</b> did not direct it to or away from the current-carrying wire, but acted at right angles to it. Ørsted's slightly obscure words were that [...] "the electric conflict acts in a revolving manner." [...] The force also depended on the direction of the current, for if the flow was reversed, then the force did too.|$|E
50|$|Magnetism {{was one of}} the few {{sciences}} which progressed {{in medieval}} Europe; for in the thirteenthcentury Peter Peregrinus, a native of Maricourt in Picardy, made a discovery of fundamental importance. The French 13th century scholar conducted experiments on magnetism and wrote the first extant treatise describing the properties of magnets and pivoting <b>compass</b> <b>needles.</b> The dry <b>compass</b> was invented around 1300 by Italian inventor Flavio Gioja.|$|R
50|$|When a CME impacts the Earth's magnetosphere, it {{temporarily}} deforms the Earth's magnetic field, {{changing the}} direction of <b>compass</b> <b>needles</b> and inducing large electrical ground currents in Earth itself; {{this is called a}} geomagnetic storm and it is a global phenomenon. CME impacts can induce magnetic reconnection in Earth's magnetotail (the midnight side of the magnetosphere); this launches protons and electrons downward toward Earth's atmosphere, where they form the aurora.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} silence, {{broken only by}} the {{clicking}} of the <b>compass</b> <b>needles</b> and snapping of watch-cases, as the heads of columns compared bearings and made appointments for the rendezvous.

2500|$|A compass {{should be}} laid {{down on a}} level surface so that the needle only rests or hangs on the bearing fused to the compass casing – if used at a tilt, the needle might touch the casing on the compass and not move freely, hence not {{pointing}} to the magnetic north accurately, giving a faulty reading. To see if the needle is well leveled, {{look closely at the}} needle, and tilt it slightly to see if the needle is swaying side to side freely and the needle is not contacting the casing of the compass. If the needle tilts to one direction, tilt the compass slightly and gently to the opposing direction until the <b>compass</b> <b>needle</b> is horizontal, lengthwise. Items to avoid around compasses are magnets of any kind and any electronics. Magnetic fields from electronics can easily disrupt the needle, preventing it from aligning with the Earth's magnetic fields, causing inaccurate readings. The Earth's natural magnetic forces are considerably weak, measuring at 0.5 Gauss and magnetic fields from household electronics can easily exceed it, overpowering the <b>compass</b> <b>needle.</b> Exposure to strong magnets, or magnetic interference can sometimes cause the magnetic poles of the <b>compass</b> <b>needle</b> to differ or even reverse. Avoid iron rich deposits when using a compass, for example, certain rocks which contain magnetic minerals, like Magnetite. This is often indicated by a rock with a surface which is dark and has a metallic luster, not all magnetic mineral bearing rocks have this indication. [...] To see if a rock or an area is causing interference on a compass, get out of the area, and see if the needle on the compass moves. If it does, it means that the area or rock the compass was previously at is causing interference and should be avoided.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rotating}} armature {{consists of}} one or more coils of wire wound around a laminated, magnetically [...] "soft" [...] ferromagnetic core. Current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature, making it a temporary magnet (an electromagnet). The magnetic field produced by the armature interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either PMs or another winding (a field coil), as part of the motor frame. The force between the two magnetic fields tends to rotate the motor shaft. The commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns, keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field, so that the rotor never stops (like a <b>compass</b> <b>needle</b> does), but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied.|$|E
2500|$|An {{understanding}} of the relationship between electricity and magnetism began in 1819 with work by Hans Christian Ørsted, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, who discovered by the accidental twitching of a <b>compass</b> <b>needle</b> near a wire that an electric current could create a magnetic field. [...] This landmark experiment is known as Ørsted's Experiment. [...] Several other experiments followed, with André-Marie Ampère, who in 1820 discovered that the magnetic field circulating in a closed-path was related to the current flowing through the perimeter of the path; Carl Friedrich Gauss; Jean-Baptiste Biot and Félix Savart, both of whom in 1820 came up with the Biot–Savart law giving an equation for the magnetic field from a current-carrying wire; Michael Faraday, who in 1831 found that a time-varying magnetic flux through a loop of wire induced a voltage, and others finding further links between magnetism and electricity. James Clerk Maxwell synthesized and expanded these insights into Maxwell's equations, unifying electricity, magnetism, and optics into the field of electromagnetism. In 1905, Einstein used these laws in motivating his theory of special relativity, requiring that the laws held true in all inertial reference frames.|$|E

5000|$|João Teixeira Albernaz {{must have}} learned the craft from his father Luís Teixeira, {{starting}} his own work in the seventeenth century.

2500|$|Compass {{navigation}} {{in conjunction}} with a map (terrain association) requires a different method. To take a map bearing or true bearing (a bearing taken in reference to true, not magnetic north) to a destination with a protractor compass, the edge of the compass is placed on the map so that it connects the current location with the desired destination (some sources recommend physically drawing a line). The orienting lines in the base of the compass dial are then rotated to align with actual or true north by aligning them with a marked line of longitude (or the vertical margin of the map), ignoring the <b>compass</b> <b>needle</b> entirely. [...] The resulting true bearing or map bearing may then be read at the degree indicator or direction-of-travel (DOT) line, which may be followed as an azimuth (course) to the destination. If a magnetic north bearing or compass bearing is desired, the compass must be adjusted by the amount of magnetic declination before using the bearing so that both map and compass are in agreement. [...] In the given example, the large mountain in the second photo was selected as the target destination on the map. Some compasses allow the scale to be adjusted to compensate for the local magnetic declination; if adjusted correctly, the compass will give the true bearing instead of the magnetic bearing.|$|E
60|$|But the {{shortest}} way {{for any one}} to convince himself of this relation of the magnetic power would be, in {{one and the same}} experiment, to interpose the same piece of iron between the magnet and the <b>compass</b> <b>needle</b> first breadthways; and in this case it will be found that the needle, which had been previously deflected by the magnet from its natural position at one of its poles, will instantly resume the same, either wholly or very nearly so—then to interpose the same piece of iron lengthways; in which case the position of the <b>compass</b> <b>needle</b> will be scarcely or not at all affected.|$|E
60|$|Rollo asked Jonas {{what was}} the way to draw a noon line. Jonas told him that there were several ways. One way, he said, was to observe some day, by the clock, when it was exactly noon, and then to mark, upon the barn floor, the line where the shadow of the edge of the post fell {{precisely}} at that moment. Another way was to get a <b>compass</b> <b>needle,</b> and put it down upon the floor, and then draw a north and south line precisely in the direction that the needle indicated. That would, of course, be a north and south line, because the <b>compass</b> <b>needle</b> always pointed north and south. He said that he adopted both these methods to make his noon line. First, he got a <b>compass</b> <b>needle,</b> which Rollo's father had lent him, and put that down upon the barn floor just {{at the foot of the}} door post, and observed the direction; and he also noticed when it was twelve, by the clock in the house, and he found that, when it was twelve by the clock, the shadow of the post came exactly to the line indicated by the direction of the compass needle; and so he knew that that was a correct meridian line.|$|E
