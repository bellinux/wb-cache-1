50|$|The {{power is}} {{transmitted}} to the aircraft via a power take-off shaft, much like those found on the drive trains of rear-wheel drive vehicles, or agricultural machines. The shaft of the starter fits into a special protruding hub incorporating a simple projecting <b>claw</b> <b>clutch</b> {{on the center of}} the airplane's propeller assembly. When engaged, the power of the truck's engine is {{transmitted to the}} aircraft engine until start up, whereupon the faster speed of the now-running engine disengages the clutch, and then the starter truck clears the area prior to take-off.|$|E

6000|$|Next in the dream-book came a curled black fish, sitting looped {{up on its}} tail. And that, the Oomgar told him, {{leaning forward}} in the firelight, was [...] "C"; that was [...] "C"--crying, <b>clawing,</b> <b>clutching,</b> and croaking for it.|$|R
6000|$|Rotherby {{took a step}} forward, {{his face}} purple, his hands clenched. Her ladyship thrust out a bony <b>claw,</b> <b>clutched</b> at his sleeve, and drew him back and into the chair beside her. [...] "Pho! Charles," [...] she said; [...] "give the fool rope, and he'll hang himself, never doubt it--the poor, witless creature." ...|$|R
50|$|For the 2001 Autumn/Winter show What a Merry Go Round, Leane had {{to teach}} himself {{taxidermy}} to create earrings of pheasant <b>claws</b> <b>clutching</b> Tahitian pearls. Later, Leane created star and moon headdresses for the Autumn/Winter 2007 show, In Memory of Elizabeth Howe, Salem, 1692, inspired by antique vintage Victorian brooches but designed to be worn as headdresses.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, this is {{the young}} lady herself." [...] And, opening {{a corner of the}} brown shawl, he {{displayed}} a child of three so pale, so thin and tiny that she looked like a small scared bird just fallen from the nest as she shrank away from the light with great frightened eyes and a hand like a little <b>claw</b> tightly <b>clutched</b> a button of Mac's coat.|$|R
5000|$|There {{was much}} {{mechanical}} arrangement {{at this time}} about the furniture, which, although to be regretted for its tendency toward instability, had some reason for its being, {{in the use of}} bedrooms for sitting rooms, writing rooms, and for the reception of favored guests; tables that opened if a portion were lifted; desks that transformed themselves; chairs, sofas, and wardrobes that answered two purposes. Lions' heads and feet and eagles' talons, although an old ornament, were now everywhere to be found again. There were claw-footed loo tables, and bedsteads and chairs resting on feet where the <b>claws</b> <b>clutched</b> a ball; certain tall secretaires, whose glass doors were sashed and latticed, were a nearly universal article; and there were charming light chairs of satin wood and marquetry [...] - [...] for satin wood had come in with the last as mahogany had with {{the first quarter of the}} century, and it would be difficult to imagine woods capable of producing more beauty than the creamy richness of the one or the wine-dark depths of the other, especially when ornamented, as frequently was the case, with medallions painted by Angelica Kauffman and by Giovanni Cipriani.|$|R
60|$|The grizzled ship's steward and the rough-coated Irish terrier {{quickly became}} {{conspicuous}} {{figures in the}} night life of the Barbary Coast of San Francisco. Daughtry elaborated on the counting trick by bringing Cocky along. Thus, when a waiter did not fetch the right number of glasses, Michael would remain quite still, until Cocky, at a privy signal from Steward, standing on one leg, with the free <b>claw</b> would <b>clutch</b> Michael's neck and apparently talk into Michael's ear. Whereupon Michael would look about the glasses {{on the table and}} begin his usual expostulation with the waiter.|$|R
60|$|Forgotten {{already were}} the vanquished rivals and the love-tale red-written on the snow. Forgotten, save once, when old One Eye {{stopped for a}} moment to lick his {{stiffening}} wounds. Then it was that his lips half writhed into a snarl, and the hair of his neck and shoulders involuntarily bristled, while he half crouched for a spring, his <b>claws</b> spasmodically <b>clutching</b> into the snow-surface for firmer footing. But it was all forgotten the next moment, as he sprang after the she-wolf, who was coyly leading him a chase through the woods.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{with all}} his keen sight, old Whitetail had failed to see some one else who was sitting right in plain sight. He had failed because his mind {{was so full of}} Grandfather Frog and Longlegs that he forgot to look around, as he usually does. Just {{skimming}} the tops of the bulrushes he sailed swiftly out over the Smiling Pool and reached down with his great, cruel <b>claws</b> to <b>clutch</b> Grandfather Frog, who sat there pretending to be asleep, but all the time watching Longlegs and deep down inside chuckling to think how he was fooling Longlegs.|$|R
50|$|The Claw of Naar is {{the evil}} wand of power used by Agarash the Damned during his ancient conquest of Magnamund. Legend held {{that it had}} been lost forever in the molten ruins of Naaros, but now it has resurfaced, and its dread return heralds a dawn of {{disaster}} for the peaceable nations of Magnamund. Your allies, the wise wizards of the Elder Magi, have the power and the means to destroy the accursed Claw, but they do not possess it. In Vampirium, you must venture into the hostile land of Bhanar and snatch the <b>Claw</b> from the <b>clutches</b> of the evil Autarch Sejanoz.|$|R
500|$|Although {{supporting}} the Conservative Party {{before and after}} that moment, Seara was focusing its efforts on attacking the Conservative-Democratic Party of Take Ionescu, with whom the Conservative Premier Titu Maiorescu had formed a coalition (one resented by Cantacuzino and Bogdan-Pitești). In this context, critic Ion Vianu notes, Seara became [...] "an aggressive publication, {{with a history of}} base attacks and blackmail." [...] The anti-Ionescu discourse was notably outlined in an Arghezi article of September 11, 1913. It collectively and disparagingly identified the Conservative-Democrats (or Takists) as ciocoi ("upstarts"), accusing them of having repressed in blood the 1907 peasant revolt: [...] "They are the symbol of 1907, when, his arms, chest, shoulders and back loaded with ravens, with ciocoi, the peasant tore himself away from his field, split himself, fought to chase them away and [...] fell down murdered by the <b>claws</b> that <b>clutched</b> down, tore down into his flesh and reached inside to his soul and killed it as well. These ciocoi, we will eradicate." [...] In a 1913 issue, Romanian Land Forces General Ștefan Stoica referred to Ionescu's men as craii de Curtea-Veche ("the Old Court rakes"), another colloquialism for [...] "upstarts".|$|R
6000|$|... 176. Again: {{there was}} not in the old creed any subject more {{definitely}} and constantly insisted on than the death of a miser. He had been happy, the old preachers thought, till then: but his hour has come; and the black covetousness of hell is awake and watching; the sharp harpy <b>claws</b> will <b>clutch</b> his soul out of his mouth, and scatter his treasure for others. So the commonplace preacher and painter taught. Not so Holbein. The devil want to snatch his soul, indeed! Nay, he never had a soul, but of the devil's giving. His misery to begin on his death-bed! Nay, he had never an unmiserable hour of life. The fiend is with him now,--a paltry, abortive fiend, with no breath even to blow hot with. He supplies the hell-blast with a machine. It is winter, and the rich man has his furred cloak and cap, thick and heavy; the beggar, bare-headed to beseech him, skin and rags hanging about him together, touches his shoulder, but all in vain; there is other business in hand. More haggard than the beggar himself, wasted and palsied, the rich man counts with his fingers the gain of the years to come.|$|R
6000|$|... "Collectively, {{the rich}} to-day have neither heart nor imagination. No! They own machinery, they have {{knowledge}} and instruments and powers beyond all previous dreaming, {{and what are}} they doing with them? Think what they are doing with them, Kipps, and think what they might do. God gives them a power like the motor car, and all they can do with it is to go careering about the roads in goggled masks killing children and making machinery hateful to the soul of man! ("True," [...] said Sid, [...] "true.") God gives them means of communication, power unparalleled of every sort, time and absolute liberty! They waste it all in folly! Here under their feet (and Kipps' eyes followed the direction of a lean index finger to the hearthrug) under their accursed wheels, the great mass of men festers and breeds in darkness, darkness those others make by standing in the light. The darkness breeds and breeds. It knows no better.... Unless you can crawl or pander or rob you must stay in the stew you are born in. And those rich beasts above <b>claw</b> and <b>clutch</b> as though they had nothing! They grudge us our schools, they grudge us a gleam of light and air, they cheat us and then seek to forget us.... There is no rule, no guidance, only accidents and happy flukes.... Our multitudes of poverty increase, and this crew of rulers makes no provision, foresees nothing, anticipates nothing...." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fitzpiers, {{increasingly}} {{energized by}} the alcohol, here reared himself up suddenly from the bowed posture he had hitherto held, thrusting his shoulders so violently against Melbury's breast {{as to make}} it difficult for the old man to keep a hold on the reins. [...] "People don't appreciate me here!" [...] the surgeon exclaimed; lowering his voice, he added, softly and slowly, [...] "except one--except one!...A passionate soul, as warm as she is clever, as beautiful as she is warm, and as rich as she is beautiful. I say, old fellow, those <b>claws</b> of yours <b>clutch</b> me rather tight--rather like the eagle's, you know, that ate out the liver of Pro--Pre--the man on Mount Caucasus. People don't appreciate me, I say, except HER. Ah, gods, I am an unlucky man! She would have been mine, she would have taken my name; but unfortunately it cannot be so. I stooped to mate beneath me, and now I rue it." ...|$|R
60|$|Shadow the Weasel stopped short. Then, like a flash, he dodged {{around to}} the other side of the tree. He had no thought of Chatterer now. Things were changed all in an instant, quite changed. Instead of the hunter, he was now the hunted. Old Redtail circled in the air just overhead, and every time he caught sight of Shadow, he swooped at him with great, cruel <b>claws</b> spread to <b>clutch</b> him. Shadow dodged around the trunk of the tree. He was more angry than frightened, for his sharp eyes had spied a little hollow in a branch of the chestnut-tree, and he knew that once inside of that, he would have nothing to fear. But he was angry clear through to think that he should be cheated out of that dinner he had been so sure of only a few minutes before. So he screeched angrily at old Redtail and then, {{watching}} his chance, scampered out to the hollow and whisked inside, just in the nick of time.|$|R
60|$|At Willersey, a Mr Andrews, a {{lover of}} birds who owns a large garden and orchard in the village, gave me an {{entertaining}} account of a pet wood owl he once had. He had it as a young bird and never confined it. As a rule it {{spent most of the}} daylight hours in an apple loft, coming forth when the sun was low to fly about the grounds until it found him, when it would perch on his shoulder and spend the evening in his company. In one thing this owl differed from most pet birds which are allowed to have their liberty: he made no difference between the people of the house and those who were not of it; he would fly on to anybody's shoulder, although he only addressed his hunger-cry to those who were accustomed to feed him. As he roamed at will all over the place he became well known to every one, and on account of his beauty and perfect confidence he grew to be something of a village pet. But short days with long, dark evenings--and how dark they can be in a small, tree-shaded, lampless village!--wrought a change in the public feeling about the owl. He was always abroad in the evening, gliding about unseen in the darkness on downy silent wings, and very suddenly dropping on to the shoulder of any person--man, woman, or child--who happened to be out of doors. Men would utter savage maledictions when they felt the demon <b>claws</b> suddenly <b>clutch</b> them; girls shrieked and fled to the nearest cottage, into which they would rush, palpitating with terror. Then there would be a laugh, for it was only the tame owl; but the same terror would be experienced on the next occasion, and young women and children were afraid to venture out after nightfall lest the ghostly creature with luminous eyes should pop down upon them.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the lions}} began to roar, the tigers to snarl, and all {{to get very}} much excited about something, {{sniffing}} at the openings, thrusting their paws through the bars, and lashing their tails impatiently. I couldn't imagine what the trouble was, till, far down the line, I saw {{a man with a}} barrowful of lumps of raw meat. This was their dinner, and as they were fed but once a day they were ravenous. Such roars and howls and cries as arose while the man went slowly down the line, gave one a good idea of the sounds to be heard in Indian forests and jungles. The lions behaved best, for they only paced up and down, with an occasional cry; but the tigers were quite frantic; for they tumbled one over the other, shook the cages, and tried to reach the bystanders, just out of reach behind the bar that kept us at a safe distance. One lady had a fright, for the wind blew the end of her shawl within reach of a tiger's great <b>claw,</b> and he <b>clutched</b> it, trying to drag her nearer. The shawl came off, and the poor lady ran away screaming, as if a whole family of wild beasts were after her.|$|R
