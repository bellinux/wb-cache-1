25|$|The {{distribution}} may {{be illustrated}} by the following urn model. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each white ball has the weight ω2. We {{will say that the}} odds ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. Now we are taking balls randomly {{in such a way that}} the probability of taking a particular ball is proportional to its weight, but independent of what happens to the other balls. The number of balls taken of a particular color follows the binomial distribution. If the total number n of balls taken is known then the <b>conditional</b> <b>distribution</b> of the number of taken red balls for given n is Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution.

A hierarchical Bayes approach is used to specify the nonlinear mixed model, enabling estimation of the posterior distributions of the variance components {{as well as the}} fixed and random effects. The Gibbs sampler requires iterative sampling from <b>conditional</b> <b>distributions,</b> which frequently cannot be directly computed in the nonlinear mixed model. To sample from such unavailable <b>conditional</b> <b>distributions,</b> approximate Gibbs sampler schemes based on the Metropolis algorithm are employed. These techniques, first suggested by Hastings (1970), retain much of the simplicity of the Gibbs sampler (moving one coordinate at a time, based on one-step <b>conditional</b> <b>distributions)</b> while requiring considerably less computing time than other methods (e. g., rejection sampling and ratio of uniforms) proposed for applying the Gibbs sampler when <b>conditional</b> <b>distributions</b> are not directly computable Two applications to repeated measures data are presented...|$|R

40|$|Quantile {{regression}} models provide a wide {{picture of the}} <b>conditional</b> <b>distributions</b> of the response variable by capturing {{the effect of the}} covariates at different quantile levels. In most applications, the parametric form of those <b>conditional</b> <b>distributions</b> is unknown and varies across the covariate space, so fitting the given quantile levels simultaneously without relying on parametric assumptions is crucial. In this work we propose a Bayesian model for simultaneous linear quantile regression. More specifically, we propose to model the <b>conditional</b> <b>distributions</b> by using random probability measures known as quantile pyramids. Unlike many existing approaches, our framework allows us to specify meaningful priors on the <b>conditional</b> <b>distributions,</b> whilst retaining the flexibility afforded by the nonparametric error distribution formulation. Simulation studies demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed approach in estimating diverse scenarios, generally outperforming other competitive methods.
