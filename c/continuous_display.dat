25|$|There {{have been}} several {{findings}} of possible sexual dimorphism in stegosaurids. Saitta (2015) presents evidence of two morphs of Stegosaurus dorsal plates, with one morph having a wide, oval plate with a surface area 45% larger than the narrow, tall morph. Considering that dorsal plates most likely functioned as display structures and that the wide oval shape allowed a broad <b>continuous</b> <b>display,</b> Saitta assigns the wider morph with larger surface area as male.|$|E
25|$|The {{stainless}} steel construction {{process for the}} BB-1 was patented in 1942. At the time, {{stainless steel}} was not considered practical; and only one BB-1 was built. It logged about 1,000 flying hours while touring the United States and Europe. In 1934, this plane was stripped of its fabric covering and its lower wing, and was mounted outside the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, where it remains to this day as the longest <b>continuous</b> <b>display</b> of any airplane. The plane has been memorialized in the children’s book Spirited Philadelphia Adventure by Deirdre Cimino.|$|E
25|$|By default, however, an {{animation}} {{displays the}} sequence of frames only once, stopping when the last frame is displayed. Since GIF is designed to allow users to define new blocks, Netscape in the 1990s used the Application Extension block (intended to allow vendors to add application-specific information to the GIF file) to implement the Netscape Application Block (NAB). This block, placed immediately before all the animation frames, specifies {{the number of times}} {{the sequence of}} frames should be played. (The value 0 signifies <b>continuous</b> <b>display.)</b> Support for these repeating animations first appeared in Netscape Navigator version 2.0, and then spread to other browsers. Most browsers now recognize and support NAB, though it is not strictly part of the GIF89a specification.|$|E
