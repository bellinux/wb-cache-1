Its projects involve such things as controlling invasive species, planting native riparian vegetation, improving fish passage, and creating off-channel flood storage. JCWC's fish passage barrier program focuses on removing or improving fish passage barriers such as culverts. The council is heavily dependent on volunteers for watershed riparian restoration activities such as planting native plants, and in their Community Science program, where volunteers <b>collect</b> <b>data</b> <b>on</b> wildlife in the watershed.

The Gemini would have flown around the Pegasus, {{and then one of}} the crew would have performed an EVA to recover a piece of one of the spacecraft's micrometeoroid detection panels. This mission would have been used to prove that rendezvous could be accomplished with any spacecraft, to <b>collect</b> <b>data</b> <b>on</b> the satellite's exposure to micrometeoroids — supporting data that the satellite had returned itself, and to demonstrate technology for military flights to inspect hostile satellites.|$|E

25|$|The Beagle 2 lander {{objectives}} were {{to characterize the}} landing site geology, mineralogy, and geochemistry, the physical properties of the atmosphere and surface layers, <b>collect</b> <b>data</b> <b>on</b> Martian meteorology and climatology, and search for possible signatures of life. However, the landing attempt was unsuccessful and the lander was declared lost. A Commission of Inquiry on Beagle 2 identified several possible causes, including airbag problems, severe shocks to the lander's electronics which had not been simulated adequately before launch, and problems with parts of the landing system colliding; {{but was unable to}} reach any firm conclusions. The spacecraft's fate remained a mystery until it was announced in January 2015 that NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, using HiRISE, had found the probe intact on the surface of Mars. It was then determined that an error had prevented two of the spacecraft's four solar panels from deploying, blocking the spacecraft's communications. Beagle 2 was the first British and first European probe to achieve a landing on Mars.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the early}} 1910s, {{there was no}} system in place to track icebergs to guard ships against collisions, most likely because they weren't {{considered}} a serious threat as ships had managed to survive even direct crashes. In 1907, SS Kronprinz Wilhelm, a German liner, had rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow, but {{was still able to}} complete her voyage. The April 1912 sinking of the Titanic however changed all that, and created the demand for a system to observe icebergs. For the remainder of the ice season of that year, the United States Navy patrolled the waters and monitored ice flow. In November 1913, the International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea met in London to devise a more permanent system of observing icebergs. Within three months the participating maritime nations had formed the International Ice Patrol (IIP). The goal of the IIP was to <b>collect</b> <b>data</b> <b>on</b> meteorology and oceanography to measure currents, ice-flow, ocean temperature, and salinity levels. They published their first records in 1921, which allowed for a year-by-year comparison of iceberg movement.|$|E
25|$|The Tiangong-1 was {{launched}} September 2011 with an intended two year service span. After the last crew departed the module in June 2013 {{it was put}} into sleep mode and it was intended that it would remain in orbit for some time, allowing China to <b>collect</b> <b>data</b> <b>on</b> the longevity of key components before being commanded to gradually re-enter the atmosphere. On 21 March 2016 the Manned Space Engineering Office announced that they had disabled data service, since the space station had operated two and half years longer than its intended two-year service plan. According to the office, the space laboratory is under continued and close monitoring until it finally burns up in the earth atmosphere. Its orbit will descend gradually in the coming months, and the space laboratory will eventually be destroyed by heat in Earth's atmosphere between the October 2017 and April 2018 Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, among others, told The Guardian that parts of the craft such as the rocket engines are probably too dense and tough to be burnt up upon re-entry and may result in chunks of debris up 100kg in weight falling to the Earth's surface, with little possibility of predicting where they may crash.|$|E
25|$|Capable of {{conducting}} multidisciplinary oceanographic operations {{in support of}} biological, chemical, and physical process studies, Oscar Dyson was commissioned as {{the first of a}} class of five of the most advanced fisheries research vessels in the world, with a unique capability to conduct both fishing and oceanographic research. She is a stern trawler with fishing capabilities similar to those of commercial fishing vessels. She is rigged for longlining and trap fishing and can conduct trawling operations to depths of 1,800 meters (5,905 feet). Her most advanced feature is the incorporation of acoustic quieting technology to enable NOAA scientists to monitor fish populations without the ships noise altering the behavior of the fish. Her oceanographic hydrophones are mounted on a retractable centerboard, or drop keel, that lowers scientific transducers away from the region of hull-generated flow noise, enhancing the quality of the data collected. To take full advantage of these advanced data-gathering capabilities, she has the Scientific Sonar System, which can accurately measure the biomass of fish in a survey area. She also has an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler with which to <b>collect</b> <b>data</b> <b>on</b> ocean currents and a multibeam sonar system that provides information on the content of the water column and on the type and topography of the seafloor while she is underway, and she can gather hydrographic data at any speed up to 11 knots (20km/hr).|$|E
