2500|$|While at Rio, {{the crew}} noticed {{one of the}} engines had {{noticeable}} carbon buildup from being run at low speed during the propaganda flight days earlier. [...] On the return flight from South America, the automatic valve for gas cell 3 stuck open. [...] Gas was transferred from other cells through an inflation line. It was never understood why the valve stuck open, and subsequently the crew only used the hand-operated maneuvering valves for cells 2 and 3. 38 hours after departure, one of the airship's four Daimler-Benz 16-cylinder diesel engines [...] (engine car no. 4, the forward port engine) suffered a wrist pin breakage, damaging the piston and cylinder. Repairs were started immediately and the engine functioned on fifteen cylinders {{for the remainder of}} the flight. Four hours after engine 4 failed, engine no. 2 (aft port) was shut down, as one of two bearing cap bolts for the engine failed and the cap fell into the <b>crank</b> <b>case.</b> The cap was removed and the engine was run again, but when the ship was off Cape Juby the second cap broke and the engine was shut down again. The engine was not run again to prevent further damage. [...] With three engines operating at a speed of [...] and headwinds reported over the English Channel, the crew raised the airship in search of counter-trade winds usually found above , well beyond the airship's pressure altitude. Unexpectedly, the crew found such a wind at the lower altitude of [...] which permitted them to guide the airship safely back to Germany after getting emergency permission from France to fly a more direct route over the Rhone Valley.

For the rest of April, Hindenburg remained at its hangar where the engines were overhauled and the lower fin [...] and rudder received a final repair; the ground clearance of the lower rudder was increased from 8 to 14 degrees.|$|E
50|$|The Serpollet Tricycle {{was one of}} {{the first}} industrially {{manufactured}} motor vehicles; it was designed by Léon Serpollet, and first presented in 1886. The tricycle possessed an oil-fired boiler and a single-cylinder engine with poppet valves and <b>crank</b> <b>cases.</b> The steam tricycle of 1899 produced about 5 HP with its 4 cylinders. It achieved a maximum speed of about 25 km/h (16 mph).|$|R
50|$|The Yamaha WR200 {{shown above}} {{has the same}} crank & Stroke as the DT200R & ATV Blaster. The WR200 <b>crank</b> <b>cases</b> {{are similar to the}} DT200R but with a bigger reed cage port and {{slightly}} revised induction port shapes in the <b>crank</b> <b>cases.</b> The WR200 has a larger cylinder bore size of 66.8mm diameter giving a displacement of 199cm with a standard compression of 6.3:1 in standard form. The standard cylinder is nickel plated and has slightly larger porting plus two boost ports ether side of the exhaust port. This in turn makes the WR200 power valve different in shape to allow three exhaust ports to be controlled. The WR200 has a direct cable clutch drive pinion in the clutch cover, where as the DT200R & Blaster use a conventional push rod through the clutch center. The WR200 also uses a larger Mikuni TM30SS Carburetor. The WR200 Frame, Tank, seat, plastics, forks, swingarm, airbox, rear shock and electrics differ from the DT200R.|$|R
50|$|The heavily finned, {{air-cooled}} Blaster engine has roots from a water-cooled machine, {{as evidenced}} by the plugged water pump casting {{on the right side of}} the engine. The history of the engine in its water-cooled form can be traced directly back to the RD/RZ125 lc (shares an identical bottom end and <b>crank</b> <b>cases</b> but uses a different stroke crank) and the Australian market WR200. It is possible to use parts from either of these bikes and build an all-Yamaha water-cooled Blaster engine, or one can simply swap the engines since the engine mounts are nearly identical.|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{different}} coefficients of thermal expansion of aluminium and silicon, high residual stresses of second order occur in Al-Si alloys depending on the cooling rate during the molding process. In products as for example <b>crank</b> <b>cases</b> made of Al-Si alloys these residual stresses may cause microcracks. In the work at hand measurements of the eigenstresses in the single phases (i. e. residual stresses of second kind) performed via neutron diffractometry are compared to numerical simulations for a specific cooling rate. To this end a three-phase model is presented, which considers the α aluminium, the eutectic aluminium, and the silicon particles. The presented model is able to predict the residual stresses in the single phases within an elastoplastic framework. The simulation of tensile loadings of these structures are compared to experiments. The numerical computations are carried on stochastic geometry models by using a fast solver [1] for the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation, {{which is based on}} the fast Fourier transformation.

40|$|Cylinder bore {{finishing}} {{requirements are}} defined by quality features such as roundness and cylindricity {{as well as by}} the manifestation of the surface profile. Honing is a proven manufacturing method s to achieve this. Undesirable distortions of the cylinder shape occur under operating conditions in a reciprocating internal combustion engine. These negatively affect the tribological system of piston, piston ring, and cylinder bore. As a result, efficiency deteriorates and oil consumption rises. The cylinder <b>crank</b> <b>cases</b> are finished in a defined tensioned state to compensate for distortions. This results in a highly complex manufacturing process and is only suited for compensating static distortions. Further increasing machining requirements resulting from strategies such as lightweight construction, downsizing, and friction reduction are pushing conventional honing methods to their technological limits. Adaptronic form honing constitutes a production engineering approach to manufacturing a free form in the cylinder bore. The objective is to keep inverse distortion geometries in store as macro shapes. These will then represent ideal cylinder shapes under the influence of distortion mechanisms in a defined engine operating range. Tool and process development and the analysis of machining results with respect to productivity, shape accuracy, and surface topography are presented and viewed as potential options for optimizing the tribological system of piston, piston ring, and cylinder bore. Other options such as shortening the process chain will be derived...|$|R

5000|$|VAZ-2101 (1970-1982) — first variant was {{equipped}} with a [...] engine (a overhead valve design, never used in a Fiat) producing [...] and offering a 140 km/h top speed and 0 - 100 km/h in about 20 seconds. Compared to the Fiat 124, 800 modifications were made in all, including to rear brakes (discs to drums), suspension (for higher ground clearance), carburettor, and some other parts {{in order to satisfy}} a wide range of Russian climate conditions, as well as thicker-gauge steel (so the 2101 weighed 945 kg, the Fiat 90 kg less). All these models had soft suspension adapted to the local roads that provided a very comfortable ride even on tough gravel roads. Early models included a <b>crank,</b> in <b>case</b> the battery went flat (an item later dropped) and an auxiliary fuel pump. In a short time Lada became a real hit in Soviet Union. The 2101 (and its first modifications) opened a new era in Russian motoring. Unfortunately, the Togliatti plant could not supply the consumer demand and people had to wait for years {{to get a chance to}} buy the car. Exports began 21 February 1971, to Yugoslavia, with 32 cars sent to Finland, Holland, and Belgium on 30 July. After a competition in the Soviet automotive magazine Za Rulem (At the Wheel), which drew 1,812 entries, in September 1971 the name Lada (Russian for [...] "harmony") was chosen, and the export models would be called Lada 1200s. Production was always behind demand, and price crept up, but by 1980, the wait for a new 2101 was down to a year. The 2102 estate version started production 27 April 1972. [...] Sales to Cuba began in 1971 (and until 2006, Raul Castro drove to work in his own saloon) and Canada in 1978, but none were exported to the U.S. Angola received its first one thousand Ladas in 1977, in time becoming a significant buyer.|$|R
50|$|Vertical {{force is}} {{transmitted}} from the opposed trunk style pistons to either an upper or lower crankshaft. The two crank shafts are geared together by a vertical drive shaft.

50|$|The Pedersen rifle {{operated}} on the hesitation blowback principle: energy released by firing a cartridge immediately caused the breech to start moving rearward, but mechanical leverage {{built into the}} mechanism caused the actual opening of the breech to be delayed long enough so that pressure within the barrel would fall to a safe level. This was achieved with a bearing surface machined onto {{the front end of}} the <b>crank.</b> As the <b>case</b> head pressed on the breech block head and forced it to move rearward (as guided by contact surfaces in the receiver), pressure was exerted on the body, which in turn exerted pressure on the crank. The crank had contact surfaces on its rear end which would transmit pressure to corresponding surfaces in the rear of the receiver, thus relieving the hinge pin of excessive stress. As the rear surface of the body continued to exert pressure on the bearing surface on the front of the crank, the leverage exerted would cause the crank to move about 95 degrees upward from the horizontal on the fulcrum formed by it being attached to the rear of the receiver by the hinge pin. The breech block mechanism thus operated in a manner resembling the operation of the Luger pistol, but unlike that pistol the Pedersen mechanism was at no time mechanically locked. The operating principle was the same as that used in the Model 07/12 Schwarzlose machine gun used by Austria-Hungary during the First World War.|$|R
50|$|The {{main issue}} {{is with the}} buildup of oil inside the intake piping and manifold. During the normal {{operation}} of an engine the excess blow-by and oil vapors from the <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> are allowed to enter the intake system. The oil mist cools and layers {{the inside of the}} intake piping and manifold. Over time this layer can build up and thick sludge can accumulate.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} an 0.049 cubic inch (0.8 cubic cm.) reed valve engine is shown on the right, taken apart (with the tools shown) and assembled.

Some unneeded metal has been removed {{from the front of the}} <b>crank</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
50|$|This is {{necessary}} because internal combustion inevitably involves {{a small but}} continual amount of blow-by, which occurs {{when some of the}} gases from the combustion leak past the piston rings (that is, blow by them) to end up inside the crankcase, causing pressure to build up in the <b>crank</b> <b>case.</b> For control of the pressure inside it, a PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) valve is used to vent the crankcase.|$|E

In 1914, Motor Cycle magazine reported on a Zenith motorcycle supplied with the 'new' 964cc (8HP) V-twin Green engine, of 85mm bore and stroke. One interesting detail seen on many modern motorcycles was 'the fitting of a glass window in the <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> to show the level of the oil'.|$|E

While the AC3 shared the same armour basis as the AC1, the hull profile had been greatly redesigned to improve the ballistic shape.|$|E
50|$|Cox {{reed valve}} engines are nearly indestructible. The needle valve and {{carburettor}} {{are behind the}} cylinder where they are protected, and the <b>crank</b> <b>case,</b> cylinder and fuel tank are all machined from forgings, rather than weaker castings. The tank back plate/carburettor is a zinc alloy casting, or later a plastic casting, but crash stresses are already well distributed {{by the time they}} reach it. The claim of dimensional tolerance, in the advertisement shown above, is justified by the facts that the high production volume engines need no break-in, except for a one-minute rich run, and any piston will fit into any cylinder that is the same size.|$|E
50|$|The {{requirement}} {{of a small}} front face area limited the car's height, which in turn required {{the use of a}} flat floor. That led to putting the engine {{in the rear of the}} car, directly above the driven axle. Subsequently there was no more need for a floor tunnel with a drive shaft and exhaust pipes, which contributed to weight loss. As the designers wanted to reduce the rolling resistance, they did their best to produce an engine as light as possible - an air-cooled V8 with a <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> made from elektron, a magnesium alloy. The gearbox was made from elektron as well and it was positioned in front of the rear axle and engine.|$|E
5000|$|These are {{powered by}} a {{naturally}} aspirated 6.3L V12 producing 444 PS (438 hp/327 kW). This engine {{is based on the}} M137 5.8L V12 used in the S600 and CL600, but the AMG variants have a larger displacement, a new management system, a new <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> and cooling system, weight-optimized pistons, and a new camshaft with greater valve lift and modified valves. [...] of torque are available between 2500-5800rpm with a peak of 457 at 4400 rpm while horsepower grows by almost 80 over the 5.8L V12. It is mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission.

50|$|The engine {{shown to}} the right has its {{carburetor}} {{in the center of}} the zinc alloy casting to the left. (It uses a flow restriction, like the choke on an old car engine, because the venturi effect is not effective on such a small scale.) The valve reed, cross shaped above its retainer spring, is still beryllium copper alloy, in this old engine. The glow plug is built into the cylinder head. Large production volume makes it possible to use a machined cylinder and an extruded <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> (cut away by hand in the example shown). These Cox Bee reed valve engines are notable for their low cost and ability to survive crashes. The components of the engine shown come from several different engines.|$|E
50|$|The RR1 uses a rear {{rotary valve}} intake {{rather than a}} reed valve {{in an attempt to}} achieve more power. The engine came after the Babe Bee and looks very similar with its anodized, {{machined}} extruded aluminum <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> and fuel tank. The power improvement was negligible so Cox reverted to the cheaper easier to build Babe Bee. The engine was made for quite a few years and sold for $6.95. A left and right hand rotary valve was made, as were left hand 6x2 glass filled nylon props for the RR-1. Some versions have a blue tank, others have a clear anodized tank. There were two versions of the tank back as well, to fit the corresponding tank. It has become a collectors item due to its uniqueness and pretty colors and is worth around $300 in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Cold-side heat removal with air: In {{air-cooled}} thermoelectric applications, {{such as when}} harvesting {{thermal energy}} from a motor vehicle's crankcase, {{the large amount of}} thermal energy that must be dissipated into ambient air presents a significant challenge. As a thermoelectric generator's cool side temperature rises, the device's differential working temperature decreases. As the temperature rises, the device's electrical resistance increases causing greater parasitic generator self-heating. In motor vehicle applications a supplementary radiator is sometimes used for improved heat removal, though the use of an electric water pump to circulate a coolant adds an additional parasitic loss to total generator output power. Water cooling the thermoelectric generator's cold side, as when generating thermoelectric power from the hot <b>crank</b> <b>case</b> of an inboard boat motor, would not suffer from this disadvantage. Water is a far easier coolant to use effectively in contrast to air.|$|E
