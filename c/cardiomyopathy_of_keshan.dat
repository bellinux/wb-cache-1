40|$|Keshan {{disease is}} a <b>cardiomyopathy</b> <b>of</b> unknown origin {{reported}} {{in some areas of}} China. Because of epidemiologic features, this disease was ascribed to an infectious agent, likely a Coxsackie virus, but it has also been thought to depend on selenium deficiency, mainly because selenite is effective in its prophylaxis. We examined the hypothesis that pharmacological activity of selenite on Coxsackie virus growth was associated with prevention <b>of</b> <b>Keshan</b> disease. We studied the antiviral effects of three selenium compounds on Coxsackie virus B 5 replication: five microM selenite reduced viral replication, whilst 10 microM selenate and selenomethionine did not exhibit any antiviral activity. The inhibitory activity of selenite on viral replication was due to its toxicity following its interaction with thiols, as that activity could be blocked by dithiothreitol, a sulfhydryl-protecting agent known to reverse several toxic effect of selenite. Zinc, another inhibitor of selenite toxicity, also counteracted the antiviral effect of selenite. The selenium compounds showed only limited activity against herpes simplex 1 virus and IHD strain of vaccinia virus. A direct inhibitory effect of selenite on Coxsackie virus replication might explain the efficacy demonstrated by this compound in the prophylaxis <b>of</b> <b>Keshan</b> disease...|$|R

5000|$|The Conan stories {{take place}} in a fictional past, known as the Hyborian Age, but based on real places. The main country <b>of</b> <b>Keshan</b> takes its name from [...] "Kesh", the Egyptian name for Nubia. Their enemy, the Land of Punt, has a similar Egyptian origin.

5000|$|Selenium {{deficiency}} {{in combination with}} Coxsackievirus infection can lead to Keshan disease, which is potentially fatal. Selenium deficiency also contributes (along with iodine deficiency) to Kashin-Beck disease. The primary symptom <b>of</b> <b>Keshan</b> disease is myocardial necrosis, leading to weakening of the heart. Kashin-Beck disease results in atrophy, degeneration and necrosis of cartilage tissue. [...] Keshan disease also makes the body more susceptible to illness caused by other nutritional, biochemical, or infectious diseases.|$|R

50|$|However, {{a fourth}} faction appears. A Pelishti traveller, Bit-Yakin, {{had visited the}} valley of the lost city in the past.

Eventually he died there; his undying servants buried him as per his instructions, and, got rid of their master's control, massacred all priests from Keshan who attempted to visit the city and consult the oracle afterwards. Bit-Yakin's servants, revealed to be large, gray-furred ape-like creatures, kill the survivors of Gorulga's party when they attempt to claim the jewels. Conan manages to acquire the chest containing the jewels but is forced to abandon them to save Muriela. They escape together and Conan ends the story by outlining a new plan.|$|R

40|$|Obesity is {{becoming}} a worldwide phenomenon.

The most important mechanisms in the development <b>of</b> obesity <b>cardiomyopathy</b> are metabolic disturbances (insulin resistance, increased free fatty acid levels, and also increased levels of adipokines), activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems, myocardial remodeling, and small-vessel disease (both microangiopathy and endothelial dysfunction).

Regenerative medicine through stem cells had an explosive development in the cardiovascular area during the past decade. Stem cells possess the capacity to regenerate, repair or substitute damaged tissue, allowing the reestablishment of its function. Stem cells can also modulate apoptosis, angiogenesis, fibrosis and inflammation, favoring the endogenous regenerative process initiated by the damaged tissue. These capacities have been corroborated in several animal models of cardiovascular diseases with positive results. In humans, therapies with bone marrow mononuclear stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells and cardiac stem cells are safe.

In {{three of the}} patients cardiological studies demonstrated the distinctive endocardial lesions and restrictive <b>cardiomyopathy</b> <b>of</b> Löffler's endocarditis and endomyocardial fibrosis. The fourth patient died with similar symptoms and signs. In blood films {{it was found that}} all four had more than 1 X 10 (9) eosinophils per litre which were vacuolated and contained reduced numbers of crystalloid granules which were also shown to have ultrastructural changes. Unlike eosinophils from normal individuals the patients' eosinophils possessed receptors for rabbit IgG-coated erythrocytes and actively phagocytosed erythrocytes coated with rabbit IgG or human C 3 b.

These studies, taken in conjunction with other recent work in this field, support the concept that the restrictive <b>cardiomyopathy</b> <b>of</b> hypereosinophilic states, including Löffler's endocarditis and endomyocardial fibrosis, is a result of prolonged release of products from degranulated eosinophils while they are in the circulation...|$|R
