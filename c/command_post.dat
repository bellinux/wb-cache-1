5|$|IAF {{aircraft}} carried {{electronic countermeasures}} pods to foil radar tracking. The IAF <b>command</b> <b>post</b> in Tel Aviv provided Ivry a real-time command {{picture of the}} air battle through various data links. E-2Cs with airborne surveillance radar down-linked their pictures to the <b>command</b> <b>post.</b> A squadron of Tadiran Mastiff and IAI Scout Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPV) kept at least two vehicles in the air all the time, providing constant location of the SAM batteries. A two-way voice communications link between Ivry and his pilots was set up, allowing for real-time command.|$|E
5|$|Rain started falling {{again and}} heavy fog {{closed in on}} the {{mountain}} top and severely reduced visibility there. Again the North Koreans attacked the 2nd Platoon and the adjacent E Company infantrymen.

5|$|About 20 North Korean {{soldiers}} approached, undiscovered, {{close enough}} to the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, <b>command</b> <b>post</b> west of Haman to throw grenades and fire into it. About 45 soldiers of the battalion command group and 20 South Korean recruits were in position there at the time. The North Koreans were driven off at dawn, but Major Eugene J. Carson, battalion executive officer, then discovered that he had on the position with him only 30 men, 7 of them wounded. Looking back down the hill, Carson saw approximately 40 men get up out of the rice paddies and go over to a tank at a roadblock position. These men reported to the regiment that they had been driven off the hill. Three tanks near the <b>command</b> <b>post</b> helped clear the town of North Koreans.|$|E

25|$|Gameplay in Battlefront is conquest-based. Each faction has {{a finite}} amount of reinforcements, and each is given {{control of a}} set number of <b>command</b> <b>posts</b> in a given level. The object is to either {{eliminate}} enemy forces or capture and hold all <b>command</b> <b>posts</b> simultaneously for 20 seconds. Several ground and air vehicles {{are available on the}} battlefield. These range from the hulking AT-AT to the fast speeder bike and vary based on the level. There are more than 25 vehicles in-game. Some larger vehicles also function as mobile <b>command</b> <b>posts,</b> which cannot be captured, but are lost if the vehicle is destroyed. In addition, some maps have indigenous forces. These can be neutral to both factions, such as Jawas, hostile to one faction, such as Wookies, or hostile to both factions, such as Tusken Raiders. <b>Command</b> <b>posts</b> belonging to hostile natives can also be captured to minimize their presence.|$|R

5|$|Still farther northward in {{the zone}} of the US 38th Infantry the North Koreans were also active. After the North Korean {{breakthrough}} during the night of August 31, Keiser had ordered the 2nd Battalion, 38th Infantry, to move south and help the 23rd Infantry establish a defensive position west of Changnyong. In attempting to do this, the battalion found North Korean troops already on the ridges along the road. They had penetrated to Hill 284 overlooking the 38th Infantry <b>command</b> <b>post.</b> This hill and Hill 209 dominated the rear areas of the regiment. At 06:00 September 3, 300 North Koreans launched an attack from Hill 284 against the 38th Regiment <b>command</b> <b>post.</b> The regimental commander organized a defensive perimeter and requested a bombing strike which was denied him because the enemy target and his defense perimeter were too close to each other. But the Air Force did deliver rocket and strafing strikes.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, September 4, {{instead of}} {{continuing}} the attack toward the 24th Infantry <b>command</b> <b>post,</b> 3rd Battalion, 27th Infantry {{was ordered to}} attack into the Komam-ni area where North Korean troops were fighting in the US artillery positions. This attack got under way at 09:00 {{in the face of}} heavy small arms fire. In the afternoon, heavy rains slowed the attack, but after an all-day battle, I and K Companies, with the help of numerous air strikes, captured the high ground dominating the Komam-ni crossroads. Numerous casualties in the battalion had led Kean to attach C Company, 65th Engineer Combat Battalion, to it. The next day, September 5, the 3rd Battalion, 27th Infantry turned its attack across rugged terrain toward Haman and drove through to the vicinity of the 24th Infantry <b>command</b> <b>post.</b> In its attack, the 3rd Battalion counted more than 300 North Korean dead in the area it traversed.|$|E
