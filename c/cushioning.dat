25|$|Acro dances are {{typically}} performed on hard stages with widely varying surfaces. Such floors differ substantially from a gymnastics floor, which is constructed by layering a standard surface over <b>cushioning</b> foam and spring floor. Whereas gymnasts perform barefoot {{and rely on}} the standard gymnastics floor for traction and <b>cushioning,</b> acro dancers seldom dance barefoot, instead depending on footwear such as acro shoes or foot thongs to provide the necessary traction and <b>cushioning.</b>|$|E
25|$|All of {{the most}} common types of acro {{footwear}} provide both traction and <b>cushioning.</b> In addition, acro performance surfaces are frequently rough, so acro footwear must protect the bottom of the foot from skin abrasion. Abrasion protection is particularly important on the ball of the foot, which is subjected to a great deal of friction during dance turns and leaps. Traction is essential to prevent lateral slipping that could result in dangerous falls to the hard floor. <b>Cushioning</b> serves to soften the impact when performing tricks such as tucks and layouts, in which a dancer's feet may strike the floor at high velocity. <b>Cushioning</b> is especially important when a Marley floor is unavailable, because uncovered performance surfaces have no <b>cushioning</b> whatsoever and thus may be extremely hard and unyielding.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the best adjustable <b>cushions,</b> for the maintenance of normal sitting balance by healthy persons in wheelchairs, from a foam <b>cushion,</b> and a newly-developed air-ad-justable <b>cushion.</b> [Subjects] Eighteen healthy participants (9 men, 9 women) were recruited. [Methods] Participants were evaluated using the Force Sensing Array System to assess average sitting pressure and the symmetry index of chair sitting under the following conditions: no seat <b>cushion,</b> a foam <b>cushion,</b> and a newly-developed air-adjustable <b>cushion.</b> [Results] The results show that there were no significant differences among the average sitting pressures which were measured on the hard surface of a chair, a foam <b>cushion,</b> and the newly-developed <b>cushion.</b> The air-adjustable cushion’s symmetry index turned out to be closer to 0 than those of the foam <b>cushion</b> and the hard surface of the chair.

40|$|Background and purpose: Pressure-relieving {{wheelchair}} <b>cushions</b> are {{key factors}} {{in the prevention of}} pressure ulcers. Studies have compared wheelchair cushions; however few have used realistic testing periods. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare a newly developed <b>cushion</b> from Keen Mobility to a <b>cushion</b> from The Roho Group, a 2 ̆ 2 gold standard 2 ̆ 2 in pressure-relieving wheelchair <b>cushions.</b> A further goal was to examine changes in <b>cushion</b> performance over a prolonged period. Methods: Four subjects were asked to sit for three hours on two different pressure-relieving wheelchair <b>cushions.</b> Pressure mapping was used to gather data on mean pressure, peak pressure, and number of sensors activated. Subjects also rated the <b>cushions</b> on comfort. Results: There were significant increases in mean pressure with time for both <b>cushions.</b> The Keen <b>cushion</b> activated a significantly greater number of sensors than did the Roho <b>cushion.</b> Comfort tended to decrease with time for both <b>cushions.</b> Conclusion and Discussion: The two <b>cushions</b> have a similar ability to relieve pressure; however, the Keen <b>cushion</b> provides better envelopment. Also, long periods of sitting correlate with increases in interface pressure...|$|R
40|$|Alpine {{ecosystems}} {{are among those}} biomes that are most vulnerable to climate change. <b>Cushion</b> plants are an important life form of alpine ecosystems and will likely {{play a critical role}} for the resilience of these habitats to climate change. We studied <b>cushion</b> size distribution and different measures of the compactness of <b>cushions</b> (biomass and rosette density, leaf area index) of the <b>cushion</b> plant, Androsace tapete along an elevational gradient from 4500 to 5200 m a. s. l. in the Nyainqentanglha Mountains of the central Tibetan Plateau. <b>Cushion</b> size distribution, total cover, and compactness of <b>cushions</b> varied substantially along the elevational gradient. At the driest site at low elevation we found the lowest total <b>cushion</b> cover, a particularly high proportion of very small <b>cushions,</b> and the most compact <b>cushions</b> (highest rosette and biomass densities, and leaf area index (LAI) per <b>cushion).</b> Our results indicate that in the semi-arid Tibetan Plateau water availability is the more important climate factor than temperature affecting <b>cushion</b> plant traits and morphology...|$|R

25|$|Separation is the {{placement}} of a flexible geosynthetic material, like a porous geotextile, between dissimilar materials so that the integrity and functioning of both materials can remain intact or even be improved. Paved roads, unpaved roads, and railroad bases are common applications. Also, the use of thick nonwoven geotextiles for <b>cushioning</b> and protection of geomembranes is in this category. In addition, for most applications of geofoam and geocells, separation is the major function.|$|E
25|$|The {{saturated}} sediment {{may appear}} quite solid until {{a change in}} pressure or shock initiates the liquefaction, causing the sand to form a suspension with each grain surrounded by a thin film of water.

25|$|There {{does not}} seem to be a {{researched}} history of sprung floors. There would not have been much perceived need until recently, when concrete slabs started being generally used for sub-floors. Before then floors were mainly either earthen or used wood on joists, both of which provide some <b>cushioning</b> from shocks. Early sprung floors often used leaf or coil springs, whence the name; these floors tended to bounce, but modern floors have suppressed this 'trampoline' effect and so are often called semi-sprung.|$|E

25|$|Aerodynamic {{downforce}} slowly gained {{importance in}} car design from {{the appearance of}} aerofoils during the late 1960s. During the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics (previously used on Jim Hall's Chaparral 2J during 1970) that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds. So great were the aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track (up to five times the car's weight), extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the suspension virtually solid, depending entirely on the tyres for any small amount of <b>cushioning</b> {{of the car and}} driver from irregularities of the road surface.|$|E
40|$|Presented at a Special Seminar: MSPO Student Presentations on April 11, 2007 at the Coon Building, Room 115 Runtime: 15 : 55 minutesWheelchair <b>cushions</b> are {{designed}} to protect skin by reducing and distributing pressure. Pressure sensors and buttock models are used in standardized testing of wheelchair <b>cushions.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore how the presence of a thin pressure measurement mat, <b>cushion</b> construction, and buttock model design affect interface pressure (IP), envelopment, and immersion. Aspects reported here are the effect of model design on IP and envelopment and the interaction between model design and <b>cushion</b> construction. Testing was performed with two indenters and seven <b>cushions.</b> Conclusion: Wheelchair <b>cushions</b> deform in response to a loaded indenter. The result is a change in the shape of the indenter-cushion interface, which may not be consistent across loading trials. This is influenced by <b>cushion</b> stiffness and the unloaded shape of the <b>cushion.</b> The data suggests that model design influences the pressure redistribution properties of <b>cushions.</b> Therefore, development of standardized tests should consider the interaction between models and <b>cushions.</b> Stephen Sprigl...|$|R

25|$|Dancing en pointe {{stresses}} the feet {{in various ways}} and thus can potentially cause injuries if the dancer does not plan ahead or take into account health and safety concerns. Injuries can result from improper technique, poorly fitting pointe shoes, and lack of effective <b>cushioning</b> and accessories. Some types of injuries are prevented by adhering to proper technique such as correct upper-body positioning, maintaining straight knees when required, keeping body weight centered over the box of the shoes, and avoiding sickling. Problems dealing with technique can be easily fixed by proper training and one-on-one interactions with the dance instructor to improve the dancer's technique.|$|E
25|$|The insole is the {{interior}} {{bottom of a}} shoe, which sits directly beneath the foot under the footbed (also known as sock liner).

40|$|Distribution {{packaging}} design often relies on <b>cushion</b> curves to determine required material thickness needed for product protection during shipment. The material thickness chosen based on <b>cushion</b> curves establishes overall package size, a key determiner of logistics costs. <b>Cushion</b> curves are constructed by dropping a mass onto a <b>cushion,</b> and interpreting the resulting shock pulse deceleration. The reported deceleration {{can be highly}} influenced by applying a “filter ” to the shock pulse, a useful standard prac-tice that removes unwanted high frequency elements superimposed {{on top of the}} basic shock pulse shape. Standard test methods for generating <b>cushion</b> curves generally do not require reporting what filter was used, or whether the filter influenced the resulting <b>cushion</b> curve information.

40|$|Stresses {{developed}} within flesh {{in contact}} with a <b>cushion</b> are examined analytically.

It is shown that an individual already sitting on a soft <b>cushion</b> re-cieves relatively minor benefit when a still softer <b>cushion</b> is substi-tuted. This result follows from the fairly flat (saturated) trend of both shear and tensile stress with respect to <b>cushion</b> stiffness, once the soft <b>cushion</b> domain (less than 10 PSI) is entered. Only flesh normal stress (compression) responds significantly to incremental changes of stiff-ness within the soft <b>cushion</b> range; reducing the <b>cushion</b> stiffness 50 percent will typically reduce local compressive stress by roughly 20 percent. While such a gain is real, it is also modest...|$|R
