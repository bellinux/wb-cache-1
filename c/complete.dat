5|$|Although CNT {{had secured}} fully <b>complete</b> plans from Weser, the Austro-Hungarian design {{modifications}} delayed {{the start of}} construction. Additional changes after construction had begun slowed the boats' progress. Compounding this were shortages of both material and skilled shipyard workers, further slowing construction.

U-48 was 70% <b>complete</b> at the war's end, while U-49 was only 55% <b>complete.</b> Both boats were scrapped in place in 1920.|$|E
