6000|$|The raft drew {{beyond the}} middle of the river; the boys pointed her head right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before the distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay, peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water, {{unconscious}} of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black Avenger stood still with folded arms, [...] "looking his last" [...] upon the scene of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing [...] "she" [...] could see him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson's Island beyond eyeshot of the village, and so he [...] "looked his last" [...] with a broken and satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the <b>current</b> <b>drift</b> them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in time, and made shift to avert it. About two o'clock in the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island, and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part of the little raft's belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions; but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as became outlaws.|$|E

50|$|In current, the {{positively}} charged particles called holes {{move with the}} electric field, whereas the negatively charged electrons move against the electric field. It is distinguished from diffusion current (manifested via thermal or density gradients), which results from the random Brownian motion of charge carriers independent of electrical stimulus.If an electric field is applied to an electron existing in free space, it will accelerate the electron {{in a straight line}} from the negative terminal to the positive terminal of the applied voltage. But this does not happen in the case of electrons available in good conductors. Good conductors have plenty of free electrons moving randomly in between the fixed positive ion cores. This random movement of electrons in a straight line is known as drift <b>current.</b> <b>Drift</b> current also depends on the mobility of charge carriers in the respective conducting medium.|$|E

40|$|Cross-flows (winds or currents) affect animal {{movements}} [1 - 3]. Animals can temporarily {{be carried}} off course or permanently carried {{away from their}} preferred habitat by drift depending on their own traveling speed in relation {{to that of the}} flow [1]. Animals able to only weakly fly or swim will be the most impacted (e. g., [4]). To circumvent this problem, animals must be able to detect the effects of flow on their movements and respond to it [1, 2]. Here, we show that a weakly swimming organism, the jellyfish Rhizostoma octopus, can orientate its movements with respect to currents and that this behavior is key to the maintenance of blooms and essential to reduce the probability of stranding. We combined insitu observations with first-time deployment of accelerometers on free-ranging jellyfish and simulated the behavior observed in wild jellyfish within a high-resolution hydrodynamic model. Our results show that jellyfish can actively swim countercurrent in response to <b>current</b> <b>drift,</b> leading to significant life-history benefits, i. e., increased chance of survival and facilitated bloom formation. Current-oriented swimming may be achieved by jellyfish either directly detecting current shear across their body surface [5] or indirectly assessing drift direction using other cues (e. g., magnetic, infrasound). Our coupled behavioral-hydrodynamic model provides new evidence that current-oriented swimming contributes to jellyfish being able to form aggregations of hundreds to millions of individuals for up to several months, which may have substantial ecosystem and socioeconomic consequences [6, 7]. It also contributes to improve predictions of jellyfish blooms 2 ̆ 7 magnitude and movements in coastal waters. <b>Current</b> <b>drift</b> can have major and potentially negative effects on the lives of weakly swimming species in particular. Fossette etal. show that jellyfish modulate their swimming behavior in relation to current.
