40|$|Textural {{properties}} and microstructures {{are commonly used}} properties {{in the analysis of}} Pleistocene and older glacial deposits. However, contemporary glacial deposits are seldom studied, particularly in the context of post-depositional changes. This paper presents the results of a micromorphological study of recently deposited tills in the marginal zones of Hansbreen and Torellbreen, glaciers in southwestern Spitsbergen. The main objectives of this study were to compare modern tills deposited in subglacial and supraglacial conditions, as well as tills that were freshly released from ice with those laid down several decades ago. The investigated tills are primarily composed of large clasts of metamorphic rocks and represent coarse-grained, matrix-supported diamictons. The tills reveal several characteristic features for ductile (e. g. turbate structures) and brittle (e. g. lineations, microshears) deformations, which have been considered to be indicative of subglacial conditions. In supraglacial tills, the same structures are common as in the subglacial deposits, which points to the preservation of the primary features, though the sediment was transferred up to the glacier surface due to basal ice layer deformation and redeposited as slumps, or to formation of similar structures due to short-distance sediment re-deposition by mass flows. This study revealed that it might not be possible to distinguish subglacial and supraglacial tills on the basis of micromorphology if the latter are derived from a subglacial position. The only noted difference was the presence of iron oxide <b>cementation</b> <b>zones</b> and carbonate dissolution features in supraglacial tills. These features were found in tills that were deposited at least {{a few years ago and}} are interpreted to be induced by early post-depositional processes involving porewater/sediment interactions...|$|R

The reservoir quality of upper Sarvak formation in Abadan plain oil fields are highly influenced by various diagenetic process. Based on core studies, petrographic analysis, well logs and properm data from two key well in a giant field, diagenetic sequence is reconstructed and the main processes effecting the reservoir quality are discussed. Three main diagenetic environments including 1 - marine diagenesis (Micritization, Bioturbation, marine cementation) 2 - meteoric diagenesis (mineralogy stability, recrystallization, meteoric <b>cementation,</b> mixing <b>zone</b> dolomitization, Dedolomitization, fabric and none fabric selective dissolution) and finally 3 - burial diagenesis (physical and chemical compaction, burial dolomitization, fracturing, burial cementation, Silicification and pyritization and some none fabric dissolution) have affected the upper Sarvak formation after deposition. Dissolution of matrix and grain, especially aragonite shells was a main porosity creating process, and took place primarily by meteoric diagenesis. Diagenetic studies indicate meteoric environment products highly modified reservoir quality. Calcite cementation and compaction are the chief factors controlling the reduction properm whilst dissolution and fracturing have enhanced reservoir quality of the studied interval. This study resulted that distribution and intensity of diagenetic process are dominantly controlled pore systems and reservoir quality...|$|R
40|$|The Las Cruces deposit is in {{the eastern}} end of the Iberian Pyrite Belt (SW Spain). It is {{currently}} being mined by Cobre Las Cruces S. A. The main operation is focused on the supergene Cu-enriched zone (initial reserves of 17. 6 Mt @ 6. 2 % Cu). An Au-Ag-Pb–rich gossan resource (3. 6 Mt @ 3. 3 % Pb, 2. 5 g/t Au, and 56. 3 g/t Ag) occurs in {{the upper part of the}} deposit. The Au grade ranges from 0. 01 ppm to > 100 ppm, and occurs as three different Au ore types: (1) Au mineralization in the upper part of the gossan linked to Fe-oxides lithofacies, (2) Au concentration in the lower part of the gossan associated with leached black shales, and (3) Au ore in the <b>cementation</b> <b>zone</b> related to subvertical fractures. A hydroseparation device has been used to obtain heavy mineral concentrates from selected samples of different ore types. Reflected-light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) were used to study the separated Au particles. Significant differences between the defined ore types include the Au-bearing lithologies, mineral associations, textural features, particle sizes, morphologies, and fineness. Au-rich minerals include native Au, Au-Ag electrum, and Au-Ag-Hg amalgams. Gold-bearing mineral associations include Pb-oxihalides, Fe-oxides, galena, pyrite, cinnabar, and Ag-sulfosalts. The Au enrichment mechanism in the supergene profile involves (1) dissolution of Au from the primary sulfides as chloride-rich ionic complexes during the weathering of the deposit under subaerial exposure; dissolved Au is transported downward through the supergene profile under acidic and oxidized conditions; (2) destabilization of the Au complexes by Fe-controlled redox reactions; as a consequence, coarse-grained, high-fineness Au particles precipitated in association with Fe-oxyhydroxides. This resulted in secondary concentration in the upper gossan; and (3) after deposition of cover sediments took place a progressive change in the system conditions resulting in a later Au remobilization as hydroxidehalide, hydroxide, thiosulfate, and bisulfide complexes in the lowermost gossan and <b>cementation</b> <b>zone.</b> The main pathways for migration of enriched fluids to the <b>cementation</b> <b>zone</b> are secondary permeability zones linked to Alpine reactivated faults. Deposition of Au seems to be related to fluid interaction with reductant lithologies, including black shales and the primary sulfides.

40|$|The Las Cruces deposit {{is located}} at the eastern margin of the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB), beneath the Neogene-Quaternary {{deposits}} of the Guadalquivir Basin. These sediments covered and preserved the supergene profile somewhat after its generation until its recent discovering. For this reason, the Las Cruces ore deposits, together with Lagoa Salgada in Portugal, are the only known deposits in the IPB that preserve the entire weathering profile, including both the gossan and the enrichment zone. In that sense, the present study provides new data on the IPB ore deposits and their post-Palaeozoic evolution. The primary mineralization consists of massive and semi-massive polymetallic sulfides overlaying a cupriferous and pyritic stockwork. The supergene enrichment extends from the primary zone to gossan and consists of a thick <b>cementation</b> <b>zone</b> characterized by intense replacement of part of the primary sulfides by Cu-rich supergene sulfides. At present, the only economic resource of Las Cruces is the <b>cementation</b> <b>zone,</b> with initial reserves of 17. 6 Mt @ 6. 2 % Cu, but the orebody also includes significant contents of Cu and Zn within the primary mineralization, and Au, Ag, and Pb in the gossan. Mineralogical and geochemical data confirm that the primary mineralization at Las Cruces resembles other IPB deposits in terms of distribution and evolution, however the gossan and <b>cementation</b> <b>zone</b> show an uncommon evolution for this kind of supergene profile. The major singularity that makes the Las Cruces supergene mineralisation noticeably different from others in the IPB or elsewhere resides in its unusual mineralogical composition, mostly comprised of newly-formed siderite, calcite, Fe-sulfides and galena. The genetic model proposed for the Las Cruces deposit includes three main stages: (1) ore genesis and evolution of primary mineralization, which seems to be comparable to other IPB deposits; (2) genesis of Cu-rich secondary mineralization and gossan by weathering, after Miocene exhumation, of {{the upper part of the}} massive sulfide deposit, under oxidizing and acidic conditions; and (3) late evolution of supergene profile below the carbonated-rich sediments of the Guadalquivir Basin, with the subsequent change in the redox conditions due to water–rock interaction between the supergene profile and basinal fluids.

40|$|Nonpedogenic channel calcretes {{of up to}} 3. 5 m thick {{occur in}} a number of {{locations}} across the Tabernas Basin in Almerı́a Province, southeast Spain. They represent the last major phase of late Quaternary calcium carbonate cementation to affect this semiarid drainage basin. Channel calcretes are situated within the basal parts of sequences of < 12 -m-thick, poorly sorted, coarse-grained and schist-dominated fluvial gravels that were deposited within confined bedrock channels. Channel calcretes occupy the full basal width of the bedrock channels within which they occur, and mostly crop out near the mouths of tributary valleys to the main Rambla de Tabernas drainage system. Six profiles from five separate channel calcrete outcrops were logged and sampled. All samples were analysed in thin section and under scanning electron microscope (SEM). From these analyses, the macro- and micromorphological properties were identified, and the mode of origin of channel calcrete profiles was assessed. Results indicate that all channel calcretes are massively cemented by calcite and appear uniform at the field profile scale. Microscale analyses reveal that detrital grains within the calcretes are initially coated by micrite, which is overlain by grain-coating and pore-filling sparite. A series of broad trends in cement type and micromorphology are recognised within individual field profiles. All profiles exhibit an increasing degree of calcite crystal size in a down-profile direction. Most field profiles predominantly contain micrite in upper parts with an increasing percentage of sparite towards the base. Some profiles are, however, dominated by sparite and show increasing crystal size and occurrence of euhedral crystals towards the profile base. Many profiles also contain evidence of postcalcite cementation diagenesis in the form of dissolution of calcite crystal faces or replacement of the calcite cement by amorphous silica, with alteration mostly occurring in the lower parts of profiles. The trends within the calcrete fabric appear to have developed in conjunction with a fluctuating water table, with the increased crystal size and occurrence of euhedral crystals towards the base of profiles arising from greater duration of wetting in basal <b>zones.</b> <b>Cementation</b> in some field profiles occurred at depths of up to 12 m within the host sediment, well below the zone of capillary rise and pedogenesis, {{and in the absence of}} significant organic activity. As such, channel calcretes in the Tabernas Basin may represent an ideal opportunity to observe the influence of groundwater upon cementation of coarse-grained sediments by carbonate. ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{flotation}} tailings sites (Ojancos and P. Cerda) from the Fe oxide Cu–Au Punta del Cobre belt, south of Copiapo´, Atacama desert, northern Chile, are geochemically (largely using sequential extractions) and mineralogically compared. Main ore minerals are pyrite, magnetite and/or hematite and chalcopyrite. Gangue is dominantly calcite with minor quartz. The host silicate assemblage is largely controlled by hydrothermal alteration {{and consists of}} variable amounts of the following minerals: K-feldsparFCa-amphiboleFbiotiteFsericiteFchloriteFtourmalineFepidoteFquartz. In this study, both the Ojancos and the P. Cerda tailings were deposited in valley dam impoundments {{and when they were}} filled, new tailings were deposited upstream. As a result, high quantities of seepage migrated downstream into the older tailings impoundment. At Ojancos, the recent upstream tailings have excess of acid potential (7. 1 wt. % calcite and 3. 5 wt. % pyrite), whereas the older downstream tailings are characterized by alternations of several meter-thick intervals with high neutralizing potential (about 40 wt. % calcite and 2 wt. % pyrite) and intervals with high acid potential (about 3 wt. % calcite and 4 wt. % pyrite). Acid mine drainage (AMD) with the precipitation of schwertmannite (pH 3. 15) and chalcoalumite (pH 4. 9) flows out at the interface between the uphill and downstream tailings. Strong downstream element transport is taking place and contributes to the formation of the <b>cementation</b> <b>zone</b> (mainly gypsum, ferrihydrite and goethite, and locally jarosite) in the older downstream impoundment. The <b>cementation</b> <b>zone</b> (pH = 4) shows strong enrichment of heavy metals (e. g., up to 6800 ppm Cu, 680 ppm Zn, 1100 ppm As), mainly adsorbed and as secondary sulfides (e. g., covellite). In contrast, at the P. Cerda, tailings impoundment carbonates are homogeneously distributed and the overall neutralization potential exceeds the acid potential (average of about 10 wt. % calcite and up to 2. 5 wt. % pyrite). The up to 5 -m thick oxidation zones (paste pH = 6. 9 – 8. 3) at P. Cerda are characterized by interlayering of coarser dark gray unoxidized layers with fine-grained, Fe(III) hydroxide-rich, ochre to red-brown colored horizons. The hyperarid climate dries out first the coarse, sulfide-rich horizons of the tailings and limits so the oxidation, which is restricted to the finegrained, due to their higher moisture retention capacity. However, results indicate that during operation an important element transfer from the younger upstream tailings to the older downstream tailings impoundment took place, possibly by sorptive transport at ferric polymers or colloids in the form of neutral mine drainage (NMD). This would explain the metal enrichments in the <b>cementation</b> <b>zone,</b> which are mainly associated to the exchangeable fraction and not as secondary sulfides. This results, in both cases (in Ojancos mainly as AMD and in P. Cerda mainly as NMD), in Fe(III) input as ferric cation, as ferric polymer, or CO 3 complexes to the downstream impoundment. This constitutes a very effective acid potential transfer to the older downstream material because oxidation via input of external Fe(III) produces 16 mol of protons per mol FeS 2, i. e., eight times more than via oxidation with oxygen. In addition, the created acidity favors dissolution of the abundant Fe oxides magnetite and hematite of this ore deposit type providing so additional Fe(III) for sulfide oxidation...|$|E

Key factors and processes responsible for high-grade mineralization {{were identified by}} studying multiple cores. The stratigraphic position of the mineralized zones adjacent to the Roches Siliceuses Cellulaires and brecciated zones {{are the most important}} factor controlling the formation of a high-grade mineralization as they most likely acted as conduits for the mineralizing fluids. The presence of organic matter, stromatolite fragments and anhydrite pseudomorphs promoted mineralization. The organic matter caused a reducing environment required for the precipitation of the sulfides. Sulfate-reducing microorganisms, which were main components of Precambrian stromatolite communities, could also have caused the necessary reduction reactions. In addition to sulfate from the pores of the sediment, anhydrite formed a sulfate source. A paragenesis with six stages was established based on microscopic observations and cold cathodoluminescence petrography. Two major hypogene mineralization phases, which consist of pyrite, chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite and carrollite, formed during diagenesis and low-grade metamorphism, and were succeeded by supergene remobilization, of which chalcocite forms the dominant Cu-phase in the <b>cementation</b> <b>zone.</b> The distinction between hypo- and supergene chalcocite is based on the identification of multiple microtextures, chalcocite polymorphism, and the association with iron and other (hydro) oxides or late generations of dolomite.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Marmara Denizi’nin doğusunda yer alan Gemlik Körfezi en derin yeri - 113 m olan yarı kapalı bir havza olup, drenaj alanında pek çok endüstriyel ve evsel atık alması sebebiyle antropojenik kirlilik riski altındadır. Bu çalışmada Gemlik Körfezi’nin  - 71 ile - 105 m aralığındaki su derinliğinden alınmış üç karotta yapılan jeokimyasal analizlerle ağır metal kirliliğinin ve organik kirliliğin boyutları ve zamansal gelişimi araştırılmıştır.   Karotlarda µ-XRF karot tarayıcısı ile çoklu element, çok sensörlü karot log alıcısı (MSCL) fiziksel özellikler ve ICP-MS yöntemi ile ağır metaller analiz edilmiştir. Çökellerin toplam organik karbon (TOK) ve toplam inorganik karbon (TİK) analizleri ile organik maddenin δ 13 C ve δ 15 N, C ve N element analizleri yapılmıştır. Karotların tarihlendirilmesi radyonüklid (210 Pb ve 137 Cs) ve hızlandırılmış kütle spektrometresi (AMS) radyokarbon yöntemiyle gerçekleştirilmiştir.   İnce taneli homojen koyu gri-kahverengi çamurdan oluşan M- 17, MNTKI- 13 ve M- 18 karotları, sırasıyla son 250, 260 ve 200 yılı kapsamakta ve üst kısımlarında 1985 – 1995 yılları arasında çökelmiş kokolit laminalı bir birim içermektedir. Ayrıca MNTKI- 13 karotunda 1930 ve M- 18 karotunda 1985 yıllarında olasılıkla Kocadere deltasından taşınmış iki kütle akması birimi tespit edilmiştir. Kütle akması birimlerinde Ti ve Zr zenginleşmesine karşın; Th, La, Nb ve Rb’deki fakirleşme, kaba silt tane boyundaki bu birimlerin rutil, titanit ve zirkon gibi ağır mineral içeriğinin zengin olmasından ileri gelmektedir. Karotların kokolit laminalı biriminde % 4 ’e varan TOK içeriğindeki artış, burada yaklaşık olarak 1965 ’te oluşan oksijensiz dip suyu koşullarından hemen sonra başlamıştır. Yaklaşık 1995 sonrası çökellerdeki organik maddenin kökeninin karasal olmasına karşın; 1985 - 1995 yılları arasındaki organik maddenin kökeni denizeldir. Kokolitli birimin çökelmesine de neden olan bu dönemdeki alg patlamaları, endüstriyel ve evsel atık kaynaklı besin elementi (P ve N) girdisine ve ötrifikasyona işaret etmektedir. δ 15 N değerleri 1930 ’dan günümüze olan zaman aralığında göreceli olarak daha yüksektir. Özellikle son 40 yılda körfezde bol besin elementi olduğunun bilinmesine karşın; nitrojen izotop oranının yüksek olması denitrifikasyon sürecinin baskın olduğunu göstermektedir. K, Rb ve Li’un 1840 - 1980 yılları arasında göreceli olarak zenginleşmesi, bu yıllar  arasında yüksek erozyona ve kurak bir iklime; son 40 yıl içerisinde fakirleşmesi ise  azalan erozyona ve yağışlı bir iklime işaret etmektedir. As, Sb, Bi, Cu, Pb, Zn ve Cd  ve Th konsantrasyonları yaklaşık 1975 yılından itibaren antropojenik olarak hızla  artmaktadır. Cd önemli derecede zenginleşme gösterirken (zenginleşme faktörü, EFmax= 6), Zn ve Sb orta derecede zenginleşme göstermektedir (EF= 2. 2 – 2. 3). Metal değerleri 1980 ’den itibaren eşik değerlerini aşmaya başlamıştır.  Mo, 1965 ’ten itibaren, kısmen anoksik dip suyu koşullarının gelişmesi ve antropojenik girdilerle birlikte artmaya başlamış ve çok yüksek miktarda zenginleşme göstermiştir (EFmax= 50). Sb, S (EFmax = 3. 6) ve U (EFmax= 3) da kısmen diyajenetik, kısmen antropojenik kirlilik nedeniyle Mo’e göre daha az zenginleşmiştir. Gemlik Gulf, {{which is}} a semi- {{enclosed}} inlet with maximum depth of 113 m {{in the eastern part}} of the Sea of Marmara, is under the risk of anthropogenic pollution from different industrial and municipial pollution sources in its drainage basin.   In this study, the extent and temporal evolution of the heavy metal and organic pollution were investigated using a wide range of analyses of three cores located in different water depths ranging from - 71 m to - 105 m. The cores were analyzed using µ-XRF core Scanner, Multi Sensor Core Logger (MSCL)  and Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP – MS) for sediment metal concentrations. analysis of δ 13 C and δ 15 N mass spectrometric and elemental C and N analyses of bulk oganic matter and total organic carbon (TOC) and inorganic carbon (TIC) analyses of sediments were also carried out. The chronology of the cores were determined using radionuclide (210 Pb and 137 Cs) and Accelarated Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon analyses.   Cores M- 17, MNTKI- 13 and M- 18 cover the last 250, 260 and 200 years, respectively, and include dark grey brown clayey – silt sized mud with some red brown mass-flow units and a coccolithopore ooze-bearing unit near the top. The lithological and geochemical correlation between the cores was done according to the chronology of the core MNTKI – 13 that was determined from radionuclide dating. Therefore, age models for the two other cores (M 17 and M 18) were created according to these correlations. Thus, the bottom of the coccolithopore ooze-bearing unit was dated at 1985 and it was revealed that this unit deposited between 1985 and 1995. Two mass flow units identified in cores M- 18 and MNTKI- 13 were probably originated from Kocadere delta during years 1985 and 1930 respectively.  The gray brown unit of MNTKI - 13 deposited between years 1945 and 1950.  Enrichment of Ti and Zr and depletion of other lithophile crustal elements (Th, La, Nb ve Rb) in these units are due to heavy mineral (rutile, titanite and zirconium) -rich silt size detrital influx. The red – brown color and high magnetic susceptibility values (25 uSI) of the mass units indicate the presence of Fe-oxides. These mass flow units are characterized with increasing trends of elements such as K, Ti, Mn, Zr and Fe that are associated with terrigenous material input, whereas decreasing trends of Ca and total inorganic carbon content due to dilution of biogenic material input. On the other hand, the Ca and total inorganic carbon content increase in coccolithopore ooze bearing unit, whereas K, Ti, Mn, Zr and Fe content as well as magnetic susceptibility values decrease due to dominance of biogenic material deposition.   The gray – brown unit of MNTKI- 13 which deposited between the years 1945 and 1950 reveal low magnetic susceptibility, high Ca and total inorganic carbon content and is distinguished in the radiography as a dark color band. These results indicate that this unit is a diagenetic carbonate <b>cementation</b> <b>zone.</b>     Increase of TOC to 4 % in the coccolith ooze unit follows the establishment anoxia in bottom waters soon after the year 1965.   The origin of organic matter that was deposited after the year 1995 is of terrestrial end-member, whereas it is of marine end – member in the coccolithopore unit that deposited between the years 1985. A high content of terrestrial organic matter (C/N = 50) is transported to the centre of the Gemlik Bay with the 1930 mass flow. Algal blooms after 1985 indicate high nutrient input (N and P) and eutrophication caused by industrial and domestic discharge to the gulf as well as sewage and fertilizers used in agricultural activities. High organic matter content and nutrient input to the Gemlik gulf leading to the organic pollution since 1930 s is caused mainly by the industries in the gulf area such as Sümerbank Filature Factory built in 1937, olive oil and fertilizer production. Therefore the anoxic conditions that developed at the sea bottom after the year 1965 {{which is a}}lso revealed by the Mn depletion onset in sediments, is caused by the high rate of organic matter input from industrial and domestic effluents that are consuming oxygen in water column coupled with the natural stratification in water column preventing the renewal of oxygen. Hence, both of these processes lead to oxygen deficiency in bottom waters. δ 15 N content is relatively higher after year 1930, reaching maximum values during the last 40 years in the gulf. If the oxygen levels decrease in bottom waters and the conditions become reducing, the reduction of NO 3 - leads the remnant NO 3 - to be enriched in δ 15 N. Because the denitrifying bacteria prefers the light isotope to heavy isotope (isotope fractionation) for its metabolism during nitrate reduction reaction (denitrification) for obtaining energy. Such high δ 15 N values indicate that denitrification has been an important process after 1930 s until present, in relation with anoxic bottom water conditions. Low δ 15 N contents between the years 1830 – 1930 (‰ 2, 5 - 3) indicate that the denitrification was not so common and the bottom waters were relatively more oxic. The oxygen content in waters increases due to decreasing temperatures and consequently increasing rate of water circulation. Relative enrichment of K, Rb and Li during 1840 - 1980 indicate that relatively arid climatic conditions prevented forest expansion and lead to the erosion that transported these lithophile elements to the gulf within clastic minerals. Their depletion during the last 40 years indicate more humid climate conditions and more precipitation leading to forest expansion and less erosion. These results are supported by climatic δ 18 O data from a lake in the central part of Turkey. Similarly K, Ti, Fe and Zr show decreasing trends during approximately 1915 according to the XRF data, in cores M- 17 and M- 18. This depletion period is correlated with the increasing precipitation identified from the δ 18 O curve from the same lake.   The origin of crustal - derived, lithophile elements in Gemlik Gulf sediments such as Rb, Li, Ti, Nb, La, Zr and Th is felsic gneiss and granites of Paleozoic - Triassic age of Karakaya unit and granites of Oligo - Miocene age that outcrop in Armutlu peninsula and the surrounding region.   Concentrations of heavy metals such as As, Sb, Bi, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd and Th increase abruptly after 1975 due to anthropogenic pollution. Cd is significantly enriched (enrichment faxtor, EFmax= 6) among them, whereas the enrichments of Zn and Sb are moderate (EF= 2. 2 – 2. 3), with all heavy metal concentrations rising above treshold level (EF= 2) starting around the year 1980. Geoaccumulation index (Igeo) values show a similar trend with enrichment factors (EFs) according to the onset of pollution. Geoaccumulation index of Cd reaches above extreme pollution treshold (Igeo= 5) in 1995 followed by a decreasing trend up to present.   Mo (EFmax= 50), together with U (EFmax = 3), S (EFmax = 3. 6), and Sb, is highly enriched after 1965, which is due in part to diagenesis under anoxic bottom waters and in part to increased anthropogenic pollution. Calcophile semi-metals such as S, As, Zn, and Sb as well as elements such as Mo and U become enriched under anoxic bottom water conditions. Increasing total organic carbon content (up to 4 % in coccolithopore ooze bearing unit) as well as depletion of Mn in sediments indicate development of anoxic conditions. Thus, Mo, and S shows high correlation with total organic carbon content. The onset of enrichment of Mo and S indicate the onset of anoxic bottom water conditions development as 1965. Because Mo, and uranium precipitates with sulphur and become enriched in sediments under reducing conditions.   The enrichment of Cd, Mo and Th in Gemlik Gulf sediments is also possibliy, partially caused by the usage of phosphate fertilizers for agriculture in Gemlik Gulf drainage basin. Because phosphate fertilizers contain these elements. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
