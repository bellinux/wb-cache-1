5|$|The scene {{abruptly}} {{changes to}} the house {{from the beginning of}} the film. Two figures that appear to be Kelvin and his father embrace at the doorstep. However, after showing rainwater in the house, the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> out and reveals that the two men are on an island in the Solaris ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} the Bird-of-Prey on Vulcan were {{combinations}} of live-action footage—actors on a set in the Paramount parking lot that was covered with clay and used backdrops—and matte paintings for the ship itself and harsh background terrain. The scene of the ship's departure from Vulcan for Earth was more difficult to accomplish; the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> behind live-action characters to follow the ship as it leaves the atmosphere, and other items like flaming pillars and a flaring sun had to {{be integrated into the}} shot. Rather than try to match and combine <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> of each element, each component was shot with a static camera and the pan was added to the resulting composite by a motion control camera. The sun (a light bulb focused by a convex lens) was shot in different passes to create realistic light effects on the Bird-of-Prey without having the light bleed around other elements in the shot.|$|E
5|$|From the start, {{the film}} moves {{continuously}} between Barton's subjective {{view of the}} world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.|$|E
50|$|The {{skyscraper}} makes a cameo in the 2010 rap video Black and Yellow, the <b>camera</b> <b>panning</b> skyward from {{a street}} view.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} {{featured}} the <b>camera</b> <b>panning</b> across an orange background while the band performed. The video also featured various fans acting as extras for the shoot.|$|R
50|$|At 38 {{minutes into}} the episode during the scene where Buffy and Faith fight, {{you can see a}} {{handheld}} <b>camera</b> <b>panning</b> on the Left side of the stairs.|$|R
5|$|The video {{shifts to}} a train where the second verse takes place with choreographed dance {{routines}} and Gaga {{wearing a black}} jacket. During the intermediate music, Gaga is shown entering a ticket booth with an inspector while kissing and caressing. As the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> {{from right to left}} the inspector changes from a man to woman in each frame. The final scene shows Gaga doing a choreographed dance routine with her crew of backup dancers. The video comes to an end as Gaga and her dancers hold their groins, gesturing towards the camera.|$|E
5|$|Then {{the video}} shows various shots at Waterloo Station, as the chorus starts. In slow motion, the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> across the WHSmith {{shop on the}} station {{concourse}} as the duo walk past. It cuts to a brief shot of a No. 42 red double-decker bus, showing the destination as Aldgate, also advertising the stage-show Evita, then black and white shots of the Tower Bridge, Westminster and the Westminster Palace Clock Tower from the sky. The duo poses on the South Bank of the River Thames in a pastiche of a postcard image, with the Houses of Parliament as a background.|$|E
5|$|All of the spaceships in {{the film}} were miniatures, as visual effects {{supervisors}} believed CGI was not effective enough to create realistic spaceships. The USM Auriga was originally designed by artist Nigel Phelps and resembled a medical instrument. This design proved to be too vertical for the film's opening shot, in which the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> out to show the ship, and did not appear satisfactory {{in the film}}'s 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Three days before the design had to be finalized, Jeunet rejected it. Phelps, production illustrator Jim Martin, and concept artist Sylvain Despretz were tasked to redesign the ship. Jeunet felt Martin's design was too much like a space station, while he accepted Despretz's design due to its streamlined and horizontal appearance.|$|E
50|$|The two <b>cameras</b> <b>pan</b> wildly {{around the}} room in dizzying combinations, {{resulting}} in confusing juxtapositions of images. Objects such as a chair, window, and plant come {{in and out of}} view.|$|R
50|$|The Pilgrims' Way is at {{the centre}} of the Powell and Pressburger film A Canterbury Tale, with the <b>camera</b> <b>panning</b> along a map of the route {{at the start of the}} film.|$|R
50|$|At halftime on January 2, 1961, the Washington card stunt was {{executed}} as the Caltech students had hoped. NBC <b>cameras</b> <b>panned</b> to the section raising the flip-cards as they uneventfully displayed the first eleven designs.|$|R
5|$|Brody visits Kristin and Stacie as they {{pack the}} last of her {{belongings}} before leaving for the airport. After giving their final goodbyes, Brody sees Kristin's limousine off while it drives off her street. As Kristin looks out of the window, a montage of archived footage from the series' earlier seasons is shown. In the final scene of the series, with the camera on Brody, the Hollywood Hills backdrop is pulled away, while the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> back to reveal that the entire scene was filmed on a backlot. In reality, the vehicle had not driven off and Kristin stepped out of the vehicle to hug Jenner.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Amuro and the {{children}} start marching and playing their instruments through downtown Los Angeles. The individuals walking in Los Angeles stop for a moment, and look towards the sky, which is cut off screen. As close-up shots of Amuro finish {{by the end of}} the bridge section of the song, the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> towards rainbow-coloured clouds, which puts all the citizens in surprise and glee. The final chorus has Amuro {{and the children}} dancing and singing at Pershing Square, surrounding by several lighting effects and rainbow-coloured clouds. Several scenes of the clouds start to float within the city, above and near skyscrapers, and the video ends with Amuro, the children, and the citizens smiling.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Tara leaves {{early and}} decides to inform Rajat's mother. After Girish brings Tara the {{required}} insurance papers, she thanks him for always being there for her and apologises for being rude. She decides {{to go ahead with}} the surgery after all. Rajat is taken to surgery, and she holds his hand until they arrive at the operating room. Shiv, on the other hand, decides to take Pankaja off the ventilator and let his wife herself make the final call. Pankaja tries to breathe on her own as the viewers are treated with flashbacks of the heyday of both couples. Tara takes a seat in the waiting lounge, and is joined by Shiv as the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> out.|$|E
50|$|This {{would be}} the only movie {{appearance}} by the twins Chris and Martin Udvarnoky, the featured stars. Mulligan never shows the brothers in frame together. They are always separated by a <b>camera</b> <b>pan,</b> or an editing cut.|$|R
25|$|The {{final scene}} {{of the film is}} shot in the exact {{position}} where Ian Curtis's memorial stone is located in Macclesfield with the <b>camera</b> <b>panning</b> out to reveal the crematorium which can be seen directly from his memorial.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{is played}} before Houston Texans home games when the {{announcer}} introduces the [...] "Home Field Advantage: The best {{fans in the}} National Football League." [...] <b>Cameras</b> <b>pan</b> the stands showing the crowd during the first 1:20 of the song.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Heiter's home, the detectives forcefully conduct separate searches as an injured Heiter hides near his swimming pool. Kranz finds the ward along with Heiter's victims. Voller {{begins to feel}} ill from the earlier drugging, and Heiter stabs him with the scalpel pulled from his leg during Katsuro's attack. Upon finding Voller dead, Kranz is shot by Heiter with Voller's sidearm. Kranz responds by shooting Heiter in the head before dying. Back in the house, Jenny and Lindsay hold hands as Jenny dies. Lindsay sobs as she is left alone in the house, trapped between her deceased fellow captives. Her fate is left unknown. The film ends {{with the sounds of}} her sobbing while the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> to the roof of the house.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and lifts a tarp off a hover cycle. As the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada singing to the camera in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the hover cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, {{and stares at the}} moon, while close-up of the clone's faces are seen singing to the track.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} production team IKIOI. It opens with a birds-eye view shot from the ground, showing several buildings and trees; just before the first verse, a short shot of Amuro is seen. The first verse opens with Amuro walking down a street in Los Angeles, California, singing to the track. During the verse, intercut scenes include various shadows of children holding instruments behind Amuro. The chorus opens with Amuro walking down along a bridge with the children playing their instruments behind her.

5|$|In Boone, North Carolina, Wallace (David Denman) and Angela Schiff (Robyn Lively) {{return home}} after a day out hiking in the fields. Angela gets a {{headache}} and, while taking a shower, thinks that she sees images of a yellow substance running down the walls. Angela and Wallace head off to bed in one another's arms but as the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> out the scene shifts to their skeletal remains {{in the same position}} {{in the middle of a}} field. FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate and after closer examination of the bones, the two find a strange yellow substance covering the underside of the skeletons which was missed in the original examination. Mulder, believing that bodies are a result of the famous Brown Mountain Lights, heads out to the scene of the discovery while Scully stays behind with the coroner (Jim Beaver) to perform more tests.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth and}} final entry in the Uncharted series, , was showcased at E3 2014, during Sony's press conference. A trailer {{features}} a wounded Drake washing ashore an island. He rises, grabs his gun, and checks its ammo before walking into a jungle-like area, as the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> to show hanging cages with skeletons inside. The trailer also features a conversation between Drake and Sully, where Drake asks for Sully's help, having seemingly just laid out a plan. Sully warns Nate against it, but Nate responds {{that he has no}} choice, and asks if he can count on Sully one last time, who confirms that he can. A Thief's End takes place three years after the events of Drake's Deception. Drake has retired from fortune hunting, and is seemingly still married to Elena, as he still wears his ring in the trailer, but is dragged back into the profession by his thought dead older brother, Sam Drake (voiced by Troy Baker), after the latter discovers a lead to the semi-mythical anarchist colony of Libertalia and with it, the possible location of the treasure stolen by the legendary pirate captain Henry Avery.|$|E
5|$|Three {{music videos}} were shot for the single; one by Yusuke Azumaya, the second being a lyric video, {{and the third}} {{directed}} and animated by Riff Studios. Azumaya's version opens with a large-figured woman cutting images of herself and sticking them on portraits of a blonde male. As she sticks it on her wall, she begins a quest to lose weight for {{the man in the}} photo, and starts running and exercising in Los Angeles, California. Throughout the entire video, it has the woman running to different locations and trying different workouts with the public, whilst small animations of her exercising are added into small parts. Near the end of the video, the girl decides to get a makeover, whilst a stylist dresses her in a pink dress. She runs towards the man in a park, though he is disinterested and walks away. A man holding a balloon bumps into the woman, and as the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> away to the balloons floating towards the sky, the woman turns into Hamasaki. The man who walked away from the woman then see's Hamasaki, walks to her, and both hug each other.|$|E

5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence and produced by Caleb Dewart of DNA Inc. The video deals directly with the lyrics' theme of Stefani's search for inspiration in songwriting. It opens with a lengthy non-musical section in which Stefani arrives in Los Angeles off of No Doubt's Rock Steady Tour. She receives several calls from Interscope label head Jimmy Iovine, who attempts to push her forward with her solo debut project, but she replies that she is tired and uninspired. After a failed studio attempt, Stefani sees a flyer advertising help for writer's block. Upon arrival she is asked {{to fill out a}} suspicious questionnaire, where the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> to the questions which will be important. She is then told that she will be billed when she is finished. She asks for clarification only to discover that she is already back in the studio by herself. When Stefani picks up an oversized pocket watch from the piano, a rabbit knick-knack that she had previously seen jumps across the room. She throws the watch at the knick-knack, causing her to fall back on her chair and find herself transported to a fantasy world based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of Minogue posing in a dark room, dressed in a {{sparkling}} costume on which rainbow-lighting is projected. She is then shown {{in front of a}} wall wearing a flowing maroon dress. As the intro ends and the first verse commences, Minogue appears in a hall and performs various dance routine with numerous female dancers clad in nude bodysuits. The singer's attire consists of a pleated red organza dress designed by Austrian fashion designer Helmut Lang (in 2006, Minogue donated this costume to the Arts Centre Melbourne museum, where it is displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection). Shots of the dancers in kaleidoscopic arrangements are intercut. A few seconds later, Minogue and a man dance together alone in a hall. Their dance ends with the man slowly laying Minogue {{down on the floor and}} leaving. Twelve women in golden and pastel pink dresses are seen dancing on a dark brown floor, which is revealed to be Minogue's hat as the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> out. She proceeds to wave to a distant person and then plucks the petals out of a pink rose she is holding. The rest of the video randomly intersperses all of the previous scenes.|$|E
25|$|The opening {{sequence}} of The Core, {{where a man}} collapses at a business meeting and the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> {{out to the street}} to show a number of simultaneous accidents, was filmed here.|$|E
50|$|Live remote {{broadcasts}} and unscripted interviews {{added to}} the show's believability. One of the show's telecast locations was the Earl Carroll Theatre on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood, renamed the Moulin Rouge in 1953.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} we propose to exploit context sensor data for {{analyzing}} user generated videos. Firstly, we perform a low-level indexing of the recorded media with the instantaneous compass orientations {{of the recording}} device. Subsequently, we exploit the low level indexing to obtain a higher level indexing for discovering <b>camera</b> <b>panning</b> movements, classifying them, and for identifying the Region of Interest (ROI) of the recorded event. Thus, we extract information about the content without performing content analysis but by leveraging sensor data analysis. Furthermore, we develop an automatic remixing system that exploits the obtained high-level indexing for producing a video remix. We show that the proposed sensor-based analysis can correctly detect and classify <b>camera</b> <b>panning</b> and identify the ROI; in addition, we provide examples of their application to automatic video remixing...|$|R
