5000|$|Early systems {{included}} the US AN/MPQ-4, which used lobe switching to switch between two angles about 35 mils apart (about 2 degrees). Reflected signals were displayed on two B-scopes. Measurements from the B-scopes were copied into a ballistic calculator, which produced the X and Y {{location of the}} launcher. The UK Green Archer radar used a manual switch to flip between the vertical angles. The radar was normally left in the [...] "lower" [...] angle setting, while the operator waited for returns. When one was seen the switch {{was moved to the}} upper position, and the second return plotted.

50|$|The KWL chart {{was created}} by Donna Ogle in 1986. A KWL chart {{can be used for}} all {{subjects}} in a whole group or small group atmosphere. The chart is a comprehension strategy used to activate background knowledge prior to reading and is completely student centered. The teacher divides a piece of <b>chart</b> <b>paper</b> into three columns. The first column, K, is for what the students already know about a topic. This step is to be completed before the reading. The next column, W, is for students to list what they want to learn about the topic during the reading. This step is also to be completed before the reading. The third column, L, is for what the students learned from the reading. This step, of course, is done after finishing the reading. The KWL chart can also be used in reading instruction {{at the beginning of a}} new unit.|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} {{first step in the}} process is identifying a workable long-term goal and long-term outcomes. The long-term goal should be something the initiative can realistically achieve and that everyone involved understands. A trained external facilitator is best to lead the group to consensus and specificity in this process. Once a long-term goal is identified, the group then considers: “What conditions must be in place for us to reach the goal? Any such necessary conditions should be shown as outcomes on the Theory of Change pathway, underneath the long-term outcome. These outcomes act as preconditions to the long-term outcome. The process of identifying preconditions continues, drilling down the pathway by posing fundamental questions such as: “What has to be in place for this outcome to be achieved?” and “Are these preconditions sufficient for the outcome to be achieved?” In these sessions, participants may use markers, sticky notes, and <b>chart</b> <b>paper</b> to identify and organize outcomes, surface assumptions, develop indicators, and so on. The messy group work is then usually captured by the facilitator in digital form, through which the content can be expanded, edited, printed, shared, and otherwise managed as the theory continues to be developed.|$|E

50|$|Epiretinal {{membrane}} is {{a disease}} of the eye in response {{to changes in the}} vitreous humor or more rarely, diabetes. It is also called macular pucker. Sometimes, as a result of immune system response to protect the retina, cells converge in the macular area as the vitreous ages and pulls away in posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). PVD can create minor damage to the retina, stimulating exudate, inflammation, and leucocyte response. These cells can form a transparent layer gradually and, like all scar tissue, tighten to create tension on the retina which may bulge and pucker (e.g., macular pucker), or even cause swelling or macular edema. Often this results in distortions of vision that are clearly visible as bowing ←→ when looking at lines on <b>chart</b> <b>paper</b> (or an Amsler grid) within the macular area, or central 1.0 degree of visual arc. Usually it occurs in one eye first, and may cause binocular diplopia or double vision if the image from one eye is too different from the image of the other eye. The distortions can make objects look different in size (usually larger = macropsia), especially in the central portion of the visual field, creating a localized or field dependent aniseikonia that cannot be fully corrected optically with glasses. Partial correction often improves the binocular vision considerably though. In the young (under 50 years of age), these cells occasionally pull free and disintegrate on their own; but in the majority of sufferers (over 60 years of age) the condition is permanent. The underlying photoreceptor cells, rod cells and cone cells, are usually not damaged unless the membrane becomes quite thick and hard; so usually there is no macular degeneration.|$|E

40|$|Simple {{observation}} {{systems to}} record natural electromagnetic noises have been developed. AGC {{signals from the}} radio receiver are amplified and filtered by a low-pass circuit to record a longperiod variations of the noise level, and filtered with a high-pass circuit to count-up the number ofimpulsive noises. The specific frequency of 9. 5 kHz {{was used for the}} observation of VLF noises. For LF and HFcontinuous observations, 164 kHz and 20. 007 MHz were used, respectively. These frequencieshave been chosen {{based on the results of}} surveying the artificial signal distribution in the wide fre-quency range. The integrated signals of each frequency are recorded on the strip <b>chart</b> <b>paper</b> witha speed of 25 mm/h. The counted number of pulses are converted into the analogue voltage to berecorded on the same <b>chart</b> <b>paper.</b> VLF flash-type noises are clearly recorded by the latter method. Some examples of VLF imminent precursors have been obtained by these systems. They showthat the signal level increases gradually before the occurrence of earthquake, and neither co-seismicnor post-seismic signals are recorded. ELF natural noises have been continuously recorded by the pen recorder with a speed of 4 mm/sec. The sensor of this system is a ball antenna installed on the roof of the institute. The conti-nuous record have been obtained since the beginning of February, 1982. The Urakawa-oki earth-quake of M 7. 3 occurred in Hokkaido on March 21, 1982. The focal depth of the earthquake wasabout 30 km and a part of after-shock region was located in the land part of the coastal region. Anomalous ELF signals were clearly recorded before and after this main shock. The ELFsignals appeared about one day before the main shock. The signal intensity increased graduallyand then rapidly decreased until the occurrence of the first fore-shock. The similar ELF signalsappeared again after the occurrence of the main shock, and the maximum after-shock occurred atthe peak of this ELF radiation...|$|E

The three categories are as follows: low changing speed, fast changing speed with regulations, fast changing speed without regulations. At the same time, rules of each feature and its relationships with some other features are analyzed, too, for all those changing speed and rules, relationships are the most important factors when design inspection methods for each kind of features.

40|$|The {{distortion}} ellipse graphical {{method is}} used regularly by scientists for the correction of compressional effects caused in side-scan sonar images by variable ship speeds. An algorithm is derived for this correction for {{the calculation of}} the true angle of linear objects (e. g. sandwaves) {{in relation to the}} ship's track: where R is the ratio of the ship's speed to the optimal ship speed (i. e. for no distortion) and ? is the false angle between the ship's track and the linear object measured directly from the image (sonograph) (0 ° < ? < 90 °). The algorithm is applicable for any combination of <b>chart</b> <b>paper</b> speed and width.

Materials and methods: Dye-marked oil (Kavospray, KaVo) was used to lubricate four handpieces (Quiet-Air, Midwest) and the air discharged from around the lower bearing was directed at the moving <b>chart</b> <b>paper</b> on a recorder whilst running for 40 minutes. Secondly, seven new handpieces (Quiet-Air, 300 SE, Midwest; Topair 796, Topair 795, W&H; VIP-Σ, Pana-air, NSK; Lares, Lares Research) were cleaned, weighed and then lubricated with unmarked oil (Kavospray, KaVo). Oil discharge was determined gravimetrically over runs of 240 minutes. Data were fitted to the logistic dose response function. Result: The dye-marked oil tests showed that oil was discharged for at least 40 minutes {{in the direction of}} the bur. The gravimetric tests showed that oil continued to be discharged up to at least 240 minutes, and that the usual practice of removing excess lubricant by running for 1 - 2 minutes was ineffective in preventing cut-surface contamination.

A Data Management System (DMS) is defined as one which incorporates a video screen for waveform preview and monitoring, direct connection of hard or optical disk via SCSI for real-time data archiving, and DR 11 digital interfacing.

The realities of budget shortfalls makes wholesale system upgrades to eliminate DAC’s entirely difficult at best.
