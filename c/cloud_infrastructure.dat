40|$|Abstract –In this paper, {{we propose}} a proximity-aware cloud service {{selection}} system to help application providers to deploy their {{applications in the}} cloud. Cloud platforms deploy multiple data centers geographically distributed around the world. We argue that proximity plays {{a very important role}} to improve the application performance when deploying applications in such geo-distributed cloud platforms. We design and evaluate the system for automatic selection of <b>cloud</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> in which we not only considers the deployment cost, but also takes into account the location of <b>cloud</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> application clients and related applications, and the interaction among application components when selecting the <b>cloud</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Since the solution space is very prohibitively large, we propose a stepwise application placement algorithm to address the scalability problems. In our simulated experiments, it shows the great performance and high efficiencies of our approach...|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{has been}} increasingly adopted by users and providers {{to promote a}} flexible, scalable and tailored access to computing resources. Nonetheless, the consolidation of this paradigm has uncovered some of its limitations. Initially devised by corporations with direct control over large amounts of computational resources, cloud computing is now being endorsed by organizations with limited resources or with a more articulated, less direct control over these resources. The challenge for these organizations is to leverage the benefits of cloud computing while dealing with limited and often widely distributed computing resources. This study focuses on the adoption of cloud computing by higher education institutions and addresses two main issues: flexible and on-demand access to {{a large amount of}} storage resources, and scalability across a heterogeneous set of <b>cloud</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> The proposed solutions leverage a federated approach to cloud resources in which users access multiple and largely independent <b>cloud</b> <b>infrastructures</b> through a highly customizable broker layer. This approach allows for a uniform authentication and authorization infrastructure, a fine-grained policy specification and the aggregation of accounting and monitoring. Within a loosely coupled federation of <b>cloud</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> users can access vast amount of data without copying them across <b>cloud</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and can scale their resource provisions when the local cloud resources become insufficient...|$|R
