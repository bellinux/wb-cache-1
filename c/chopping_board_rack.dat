40|$|Hygiene {{standard}} of buffalo meat in Dharan {{was assessed by}} microbiological analyses and eld survey method. Ten samples of buffalo meat, knives, <b>chopping</b> <b>board</b> and hands of butchers were examined for total plate count (TPC), total coliforms, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella and Shigella. Average of TPC, Coliforms, E. coli and S. aureus counts in meat were 3. 59 × 107, 2. 06 × 104, 1. 69 × 103 and 9. 67 × 103 cfu/g respectively. Salmonella was detected in 80 % samples and all samples were Shigella positive. The average TPC count of <b>chopping</b> <b>board,</b> knives and hands {{were found to be}} 3. 15 × 104, 3. 47 × 103 and 2. 01 × 104 cfu/ cm 2 respectively.

50|$|The wood is {{generally}} hard, tough and heavy, hornbeams particularly so; several species were of significant {{importance in the}} past where very hard wood capable of withstanding heavy wear was required, such as for cartwheels, water wheels, cog wheels, tool handles, <b>chopping</b> <b>boards,</b> and wooden pegs. In most of these uses, wood has now been replaced by metal or other man-made materials.|$|R
50|$|Bacteria or allergens {{can easily}} be {{transmitted}} {{from one part of}} the kitchen to another or from one food to another via knives, hands, or surfaces such as <b>chopping</b> <b>boards.</b> To reduce the chance of this it is advised to use separate boards for different types of food such as raw meat, cooked meat, dairy and vegetables.

50|$|A {{characteristic}} of this homemade dish is the rhythmic pounding of the cleaver against the <b>chopping</b> <b>board</b> during preparing the hand-minced pork.

40|$|A {{study has}} been done to analyse the {{microbiological}} quality of salads served along with street foods of Hyderabad. A total of 163 salad samples, 53 of carrot and 110 of onion samples, were collected from four different zones of Hyderabad. About 74 % and 56 % had Staphylococcus aureus in carrots and onions, respectively. Fifty-eight percent of carrots and forty-five percent of onions samples contained Salmonella, 68 % of carrots and 24 % of onions had Yersinia. HACCP study was carried out with 6 street food vendors to identify the source of Salmonella contamination in salads. Food handlers were found to be responsible for Salmonella contamination in salads. The present study revealed the potential hazards of street vended salad vegetables, considering the handling practice usually carried out by vendors. Ninety-eight percent of the vendors did not wash the vegetables before processing and serving while about 56. 6 % of the vendors did not peel the vegetables. Majority of street vendors’ nails were uncut. A significant difference (P< 0. 01) was observed in Yersinia spp. and Salmonella spp. in wet-dirty <b>chopping</b> <b>board</b> when compared to clean-dry <b>chopping</b> <b>board.</b> A significant difference (P< 0. 05) of Staphylococcus spp. was observed when the status of cleaning cloth was neat/untidy...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, Spätzle {{are made}} by {{scraping}} long, thin strips of dough off a wooden (sometimes wet) <b>chopping</b> <b>board</b> (Spätzlebrett) into boiling salted water where they cook until they rise to the surface. Altogether, the dough should thus be as viscous as to slowly flow apart if cut into strips with a knife, yet hold the initial shape for some seconds. If dropped into boiling water, the albumen will congeal quickly in the boiling water, while the yolk will keep the dough succulent. After the noodles have become firm, they are skimmed and put aside.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the occurrence of microbiological contamination of kitchen utensils and environments of food service operations at university located in Seoul, Korea. Methods: We collected swab samples from the surfaces of knives, <b>chopping</b> <b>boards,</b> floors, and drains, as well as drinking water and airborne bacteria samples from 20 food service operations. Three bacterial indicators and five food poisoning bacteria were measured quantitatively and qualitatively, respectively. We used selective culture media and the PCR assay targeting 16 S rRNA gene for the microbiological analysis. Results: We detected bacterial indicators on knives or <b>chopping</b> <b>boards</b> in eight different food service operations and, three food service operations(I, M, and O) showed more than 3 log colony forming units(CFU) / 100 cm 2 on their knives, significantly higher than the others. The levels of bacterial indicators on the floors and drains in the cooking areas were much higher than those on the cooking utensils. S. aureus was detected on 10 floors and 8 drains. Culturable bacteria were identified in 5 drinking water samples, and food service operation B (431. 1 CFU/m 3) and C(551. 2 CFU/m 3) showed more than 400 CFU/m 3 of total airborne bacteria. Conclusions: These results suggest that some of food service operations in this study may require additional investigation to secure the microbial safety of cooking environments. In addition, further actions includin...|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of the director Roy Midwinter, the company became one of the leading innovators in British tableware production. A large part of this was due to the noted ceramicists and designers who worked for the pottery, including Jessie Tait, Terence Conran, Hugh Casson, John Russell and Peter Scott. The Midwinter Pottery was also an innovator in producing 'accessories' to their basic dinner services and tea sets. The Clayburn Pottery, a sister company to Midwinter, made pieces such as lamp bases that could be added to a Midwinter dinner service.

25|$|UHMWPE is {{polyethylene}} with {{a molecular}} weight numbering in the millions, usually between 3.5 and 7.5 million amu. The {{high molecular weight}} makes it a very tough material, but results in less efficient packing of the chains into the crystal structure as evidenced by densities of less than high-density polyethylene (for example, 0.930–0.935nbsp&g/cm3). UHMWPE can be made through any catalyst technology, although Ziegler catalysts are most common. Because of its outstanding toughness and its cut, wear, and excellent chemical resistance, UHMWPE is used in a diverse range of applications. These include can- and bottle-handling machine parts, moving parts on weaving machines, bearings, gears, artificial joints, edge protection on ice rinks, and butchers' <b>chopping</b> <b>boards.</b> It is commonly used {{for the construction of}} articular portions of implants used for hip and knee replacements.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{recognizing}} ingredients in food preparing activity. The research for object recognition mainly focuses on only visual information; however, ingredients are difficult to recognize only by visual information because of their limited color variations and larger within-class differ-ence than inter-class difference in shapes. In this paper, we propose a method that involves some physical signals obtained in a cutting process by attaching load and sound sensors to the <b>chopping</b> <b>board.</b> The load may depend on an ingredient’s hardness. The sound produced when a knife passes through an ingredient reflects {{the structure of the}} ingredient. Hence, these signals are expected to facilitate more precise recognition. We confirmed the effectiveness of the integration of the three modalities (visual, auditory, and load) through experiments in which the developed method was applied to 23 classes of ingredients...|$|R
50|$|Royds individualistic {{approach}} to her woodcuts - applying pigments to printing blocks using a brush {{rather than a}} roller - resulted in unique variations of each of her prints. Additionally, Royds preferred to produce on demand, rather than creating limited edition runs, further ensuring a one-of-a-kind piece. To prepare, Royds often created colored paper collages before her final drawing. Although cherry wood was ideal, Royds usually used Woolworth’s 6d pastry boards - a cheaper alternative. Despite using <b>chopping</b> <b>boards</b> that cost her only sixpence, Royds' prints remained professional and sophisticated, proving her mastery of the technique. After carving the woodblocks, she printed impressions by rubbing the sheet with a Japanese barren. In her later works, Royds would either eliminate the keyblock entirely or print it in multiple colors - creating direct relationships between the colors instead of having them separated by borders.|$|R
