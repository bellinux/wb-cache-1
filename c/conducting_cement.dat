40|$|Plastic {{cracking}} {{of cement}} mortar and concrete is primarily attributable to desiccation by evaporation from unprotected surfaces. This causes high suctions (negative pressures) {{to develop in}} the pore water adjacent to these surfaces. Dissolved salts in the pore water can also contribute significantly to suctions.

The development of suctions over time is illustrated by the results of desiccation tests <b>conducted</b> on <b>cement</b> mortars, supplemented by data from the literature. It is shown that ambient conditions conducive to plastic cracking can arise almost anywhere, but that the extremely high suctions that develop in mature cement mortar and concrete do not imply that compression failures should occur A high value of fracture energy is derived from data from the desiccation tests that implies that plastic cracking is characterized by a significant zone of plastic straining or microcracking...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} model {{based on the}} finite element method was developed for the load transfer analysis at the tibial bone-implant interfaces in total knee replacement. A transverse isotropic material model, based on a quadratic elastic potential and on Hill's quadratic yield criterion, was next developed for bone constitutive laws. The bone-cement and bone-prosthesis interfaces were both assumed to be discontinuous. A dry friction model based on Coulomb's criterion was adopted for the interfaces friction. The model was shown {{to be able to}} give compressive and shear stresses distributions and distractive and relative shear micromotions at these interfaces. A preliminary application was <b>conducted</b> for <b>cemented</b> metal tray total condylar (MTTC) and for cemented and uncemented porous coated anatomic (PCA) tibial plateaus.

Correspondingly, the stress peaks at the interface beneath the tray were lower for the uncemented PCA. Correspondingly, the stress peaks at the interface beneath the tray were lower for the PCA than for the MTTC. Shear micromotions appeared under the tray for both the two prostheses.

The outcomes indicate that both qu and qt increase nonlinearly {{with the increase in}} lime content and curing period, which is further justified by microstructural study that illustrates the occurrence of larger agglomeration in particles. In addition to these, a good correlation between qu and qt and L and t was possible by fitting the power function on the outcomes. Furthermore, a unique relationship between qu and qt is also developed, which is independent of L and t (i.e. qt/qu[*]=[*] 0.16).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is an {{analytical}} tool increasingly implemented in clinical practice. Breast cancer {{is primarily a}} disease of older people; however, most evidence-based research is aimed at younger patients. Methods A systematic review of literature was carried out to assess the use of CGA in older breast cancer patients for clinical decision making. The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched. Results A total of nine useful full text article results were found. Only five of these were exclusively concerned with early breast cancer; thus, studies involving a variety of cancer types, stages and treatments were accepted, {{as long as they}} included early breast cancer. The results comprised a series of low sources of evidence. However, all results shared a common theme: the CGA has a use in determining patient suitability for different types of cancer treatment and subsequently maximizing the patient’s quality of life. Conclusions There is not yet sufficient high level evidence to instate CGA guidelines as a mandatory practice in the management of breast cancer, due to the heterogeneity of available studies. More studies need to be <b>conducted</b> to <b>cement</b> current work on the benefits of the CGA. An area of particular interest is with regard to treatment options, especially surgery and chemotherapy, and identifying patients who may be suitable for these treatments. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} planned to {{investigate}} the properties of Portland cement mixtures containing silica fume and mixed with saturated lime water. The <b>conducted</b> Portland <b>cement</b> mixes included three groups; cement pastes, cement mortars and cement concrete mixes. The main parameters were; type of mixing solution (water or lime-water) {{as well as the}} percentage of Portland cement replaced by silica fume. Consistency level, times of initial and final settings, compressive strength development, existence and intensity of CH crystals with age, pozzolanic activity as well as efficiency of the investigated matrices to delay the corrosion of embedded steel bars were the investigated properties. Test results show that using lime-water in mixing enhances consistency degree compared to the corresponding control mixes. Furthermore, it delays both initial and final setting times compared with traditional water due to the common ion effect principles. Moreover, combined use of lime-water and silica fume enhances the pozzolanic reaction that was identified by the strength development at both early and later ages. The existence of CH crystals for higher percentages of silica fume (up to 30 %) for further reaction at later ages was observed by XRD results. Moreover, combined use of silica fume and lime-water ensures a high alkaline media around steel bars from the moment of ingredients mixing as long as later ages despite of pozzolanic reaction that was identified from results of chloride attack...|$|R
5000|$|Volume II of {{the report}} cited above {{contains}} {{the report of the}} Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE). [...] That volume states that a central cause of the blowout was failure of acement barrier in the production casing string, a high‐strength steel pipe set in a well to ensure well integrity and to allow future production. The failure of the cement barrier allowed hydrocarbons to flow up the wellbore, through the riser and onto the rig, resulting in the blowout. The loss of life and the subsequent pollution of the Gulf of Mexico were the result of poor risk management, last‐minute changes to plans, failure to observe and respond to critical indicators, inadequate well control response, and insufficient emergency bridge response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling at the Macondo well and for the operation of the drilling platform. BP, as the designated operator under BOEMRE regulations, was ultimately responsible for conducting operations at Macondo in a way thatensured the safety and protection of personnel, equipment, natural resources, and the environment. Transocean, the owner of the Deepwater Horizon, was responsible for conducting safe operations and for protecting personnel on board.

This paper presents experimental findings regarding the elastomeric influence of natural rubber latex on compressive strength of concrete at elevated temperatures. Normal and modified concrete specimens were prepared, heated, and subsequently tested for compressive strength. Five temperatures-ambient temperature (27 degrees C), 150, 300, 500, and 800 degrees C-were applied.
