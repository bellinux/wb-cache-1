40|$|Compressed {{air supply}} and demand {{strategies}} have received significant attention since integrated demand management was initiated by Eskom. Due to the expensive nature of this vastly utilised energy carrier, every increase in the efficiency of a system is needed. Usually controlling the compressed air demand resulted in a reduced need for supply, ultimately leading to energy savings. The majority of compressed air optimisation projects on deep level mines in South Africa utilise demand side management initiatives to control or reduce compressed air usage. However, reduction in usage through control, leak repairs and reduced demand often results in system pressure build up. Compressed air supply must also then be reduced accordingly using capacity controllers. The existing capacity control is typically upgraded to reduce compressor output capacity automatically. The problem encountered is that not all compressor controls are created equal, and they produce different results in terms of efficient supply reduction. Inefficient <b>compressor</b> <b>control</b> is frequently encountered in industry today. On average, compressors operate at 16 % below their maximum efficient point due to inefficient surge and capacity controllers. In contrast to this, intelligent <b>compressor</b> <b>control</b> resulted in compressors operating within 9 % of their maximum efficiency point.

40|$|PhD (Electrical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Compressed air {{makes up}} an {{important}} part of South African precious metal mining processes. Rising operational costs in the struggling mining sector increased the interest of the power utility, Eskom, and mine management in achievable electrical energy savings. Demand side management initiatives, funded by Eskom, realised a significant improvement in electrical energy efficiency of compressed air networks. Supply side interventions further aided optimisation by lowering operational costs. Previous research identified the need for integrating compressed air supply and demand side initiatives. Automated <b>compressor</b> <b>control</b> systems were needed in industry to realise missed opportunities due to human error on manual control systems. Automatic systems were found to be implemented in the industry, but missed savings opportunities were still encountered. This was due to the static nature of these control systems, requiring human intervention from skilled artisans. A comprehensive system is required that can adjust dynamically to the ever-changing demand and other system changes. Commercially available simulation software packages have been used by various mine groups to determine an optimal control philosophy. Satisfactory results were obtained, but the simulations were still based on static control inputs. No simulation system was found that could solve and optimise a system based on real-time instrumentation feedback. By combining simulation capabilities with dynamic control in real time, advanced optimisation could be achieved. Development was done on the theoretical design of the system, where mathematical calculations and the accuracy of the system were evaluated. This study proved that the new controller was viable and, as a result, the development of a fully dynamic control Automation of compressor networks through a dynamic control system iii system incorporating the verified mathematical models followed. All of this was done following a theoretical approach. Intricate control requirements on the supply side were evaluated to determine the impact of new intelligent <b>compressor</b> <b>control</b> strategies. It was found that improved <b>compressor</b> <b>control</b> realised an additional 6. 2 % electrical energy saving on top of existing savings initiatives. Practical limitations and human perception issues were also addressed. Financial cost-benefit analyses were used to evaluate the viability of using automated <b>compressor</b> <b>control.</b> Ample maintenance data obtained from two leading mining companies was used to evaluate the impact of increased stopping and starting of compressors. Financial cost savings from electrical energy efficiency control strategies were found to considerably outweigh the minimal increase in compressor maintenance. Savings potential on deep-level mines proved to be in the order of 5 % of the baseline consumption. When these results are extrapolated to the remaining 22 South African deep-level gold and platinum mines already subjected to demand side management initiatives, potential savings of 12. 67 MW can be realised. Based on the Eskom 2014 / 2015 Megaflex tariff structure, the financial cost saving from 12. 67 MW is R 61 million. Doctora...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Eskom {{is under}} {{increasing}} pressure to provide reliable and sustainable electricity. Demand Side Management (DSM), offers a short– to medium–term {{solution to this}} problem. During 2009, the mining sector consumed approximately 16 % of the domestic electricity supplied by Eskom. This made the mining sector {{one of the major}} targets for Eskom–initiated DSM programmes. The mining industry uses compressed air {{for a wide variety of}} applications and production purposes. This creates many opportunities to reduce electricity consumption and operating costs. Reducing the airsystem demand may however not result in significant electrical energy savings, unless the compressed–air supply is accurately managed to meet the reduced demand. Until recently, <b>compressor</b> <b>control</b> in the mining sector generally consisted of operating the compressors continuously, regardless of the actual demand for compressed air. Excessive compressed air is blown off into the atmosphere resulting in energy loss. This usually occurs when the compressors are operated manually. A computer–controlled compressor management solution, which optimises the efficiency potential of the compressed–air supply, is required to obtain significant electrical energy savings. The need for such a solution was addressed by the development of an energy management solution for mine compressor systems. This solution is referred to as Energy Management System (EMS) and is capable of starting, stopping, loading and unloading compressors. In addition to this, compressor output can be controlled to maintain a desired pressure set–point. In this study, the development and implementation of EMS on ten different mine compressor systems is presented. Automatic compressor capacity control was implemented, while an operator manually initiated compressor starting; stopping; loading and unloading, according to EMS control schedules. Centralised <b>compressor</b> <b>control</b> is one of the main advantages offered by EMS, especially for compressed–air systems with multiple compressor systems at different geographic locations.
