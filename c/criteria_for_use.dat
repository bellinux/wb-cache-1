The criteria also indicate that the subject should be 16 or older and that the child or children they fantasize about are at least five years younger than them, though ongoing sexual relationships between a 12- to 13-year-old and a late adolescent are advised to be excluded. A diagnosis is further specified by the sex of the children the person is attracted to, if the impulses or acts are limited to incest, and if the attraction is [...] "exclusive" [...] or [...] "nonexclusive".|$|E

50|$|Bio{{accumulation}} is {{the accumulation}} of substances, such as pesticides, or other chemicals in an organism. Bioaccumulation occurs when an organism absorbs a substance at a rate faster than that at which the substance is lost by catabolism and excretion. Thus, the longer the biological half-life of a toxic substance, the greater the risk of chronic poisoning, even if environmental levels of the toxin are not very high. Bioaccumulation, for example in fish, can be predicted by models. Hypotheses for molecular size cutoff <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> as bioaccumulation potential indicators are not supported by data.

This test identifies flooring that has a high propensity to lose its wet slip resistance.|$|E

Ballinamallard's first match back at the upgraded Ferney Park was on 5 December 2009. Floodlights were installed in 2010. In 2012, Ballinamallard United were promoted to the IFA Premiership after receiving a domestic licence to do so from the Irish Football Association. However at the time, Ferney Park did not meet the required standards. The club {{were in the process of}} building two new stands, funded by fans buying seats. The plans and designs of the new stands were printed on the cover of the matchday programme for United's last game before being promoted against Ards. The building of the stands could not be guaranteed to be completed before the start of the Irish Premiership season. As a result, the club were obliged to nominate Stangmore Park in Dungannon, County Tyrone as their home ground if construction could not be finished in time. At a cost of £80,000 from four fans, the pitch at Ferney Park was also re-laid in preparation. However, the work was finished in time for Ferney Park to be used to host Ballinamallard's opening game against Dungannon Swifts. The new stands were also officially opened for this match.|$|E
