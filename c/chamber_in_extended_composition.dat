5000|$|Christopher Marlowe was {{the first}} English author to make full use of the {{potential}} of blank verse. The major achievements in English blank verse were made by William Shakespeare, who wrote much {{of the content of}} his plays in unrhymed iambic pentameter, and John Milton, whose Paradise Lost is written in blank verse. Miltonic blank verse was widely imitated in the 18th century by such poets as James Thomson (in The Seasons) and William Cowper (in The Task). Romantic English poets such as William Wordsworth, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Keats used blank verse as a major form. Shortly afterwards, Alfred, Lord Tennyson became particularly devoted to blank verse, using it for example in his long narrative poem [...] "The Princess", as well as for one of his most famous poems: [...] "Ulysses". Among American poets, Hart Crane and Wallace Stevens are notable for using blank verse <b>in</b> <b>extended</b> <b>compositions</b> {{at a time when many}} other poets were turning to free verse.|$|R

The extended Presidency wasn't grounded in the Constitution and couldn't itself adopt any decisions.|$|R

These composers are archetypal jazz orchestral composers and are currently active.

The aim of this exegesis is to uncover {{the way in which}} jazz orchestral composition invokes concepts related to theme and development identified in classical analytical literature. As such, I will argue that the works analysed here suggest a move more toward forms associated with the classical period, such as sonata form...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Hausdorff distance, the Gromov–Hausdorff, the Fréchet and {{the natural}} pseudo-distance are {{instances}} of dissimilarity measures widely used in shape comparison. We show that they share the property of being defined as infρF(ρ) where F is a suitable functional and ρ varies {{in a set of}} correspondences containing the set of homeomorphisms.

40|$|Since {{the work}} of Gunther Kress, Cynthia Selfe, Anne Wysocki, the New London Group and others, many {{composition}} instructors are integrating the study and practice of new communication technologies into their pedagogy. This burgeoning amalgam of fields, which I call new media literacy studies, is heavily invested <b>in</b> <b>extending</b> first-year <b>composition</b> and literacy instruction to address the growing ubiquity of information communication technologies. This thesis begins with {{an exploration of the}} scope of these new media literacy theories, and argues for a new media literacy theory grounded in the dialogic theories of Mikhail Bakhtin and the Sophists. By bringing a broad spectrum of new media literacy theories into a dialogue with Bakhtinian theory and Sophistic theory, this thesis develops and explores a new literacy theory specifically addressing multimodal representational practice. Finally, this thesis describes a pedagogy built on this theoretical framework. The dialogic pluralism of this pedagogy could foster an environment wherein students are prepared to deploy a wide variety of communication strategies-in multiple modes-so as {{to meet the demands of}} an assortment of rhetorical situations...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} phase diagram and the {{microstructure}} of the binary surfactant mixture of AOT and C(12) E(4) in D(2) O as characterized by surface tension and small angle neutron scattering. The micellar region is considerably <b>extended</b> <b>in</b> <b>composition</b> and concentration {{compared to that}} observed for the pure surfactant systems, and two types of aggregates are formed. Spherical micelles are present for AOT-rich composition, whereas cylindrical micelles with a mean length between 80 and 300 Å {{are present in the}} nonionic-rich region. The size of the micelles depends on both concentration and molar ratio of the surfactant mixtures. At higher concentration, a swollen lamellar phase is formed, where electrostatic repulsions dominate over the Helfrich interaction in the mixed bilayers. At intermediate concentrations, a mixed micellar/lamellar phase exists...|$|R
40|$|The {{miscibility}} {{of random}} copolymers of o-chlorostyrene and p-chlorostyrene [P(oClS-pClS) ] with polystyrene (PS) {{has been studied}} by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A miscibility “window” was found, <b>extending</b> <b>in</b> copolymer <b>composition</b> from about 68 to 98 mole % o-chlorostyrene at a temperature of 150 °C. The maximum in the miscibility window occurred at approximately 170 °C and a composition of 83 mole % o-chlorostyrene. This result differs only slightly from theoretical predictions based on interaction parameters previously calculated from miscibility behavior in blends of poly(2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene oxide) with P(oClS-pClS), poly(styrene-co-o-chlorostyrene) and poly(styrene-co-p-chlorostyrene). The implication of this result for the numerical values of the six interaction parameters required to describe these blends is discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{considers}} {{the composition of}} tuples from two relations in order to derive additional tuples {{of one of these}} relations. Our purpose is to determine when the composition is plausible and for which relation the new tuples are derived. We first present a formal definition of composition and our extension to it. We next define conditions on the domains and ranges of the relations that are necessary for <b>extended</b> <b>composition</b> to occur. We then show how a set of underlying attributes, independently specified for each relation, is sufficient for determining plausible composition, when the primitives are combined according to an algebra. Finally, we apply our method for <b>extended</b> <b>composition</b> to a representative group of semantic relations and evaluate the results. ...|$|R
