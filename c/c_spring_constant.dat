40|$|Abstract Background This study {{tests the}} {{validity}} of a newly-proposed <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> method to analyze arterial elasticity in type 2 diabetic patients. Methods The experimental group comprised 66 participants (36 men and 30 women) ranging between 46 and 86 years of age, all with diabetes mellitus. In the experimental group, 21 participants suffered from atherosclerosis. All were subjected to the measurements of both the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> method. The comparison (control) group comprised 66 normal participants (37 men and 29 women) with an age range of 40 to 80 years {{who did not have}} diabetes mellitus. All control group members were subjected to measurement by the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> method. Results Statistical analysis of the experimental and control groups indicated a significant negative correlation between the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> and the cfPWV (P r = − 0. 824 and – 0. 71). Multivariate analysis similarly indicated a close relationship. The Student’s t test was used to examine the difference in the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> parameter between the experimental and control groups. A P- value less than. 05 confirmed that the difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant. In receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), the Area Under Curve (AUC, = 0. 85) indicates good discrimination. These findings imply that the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> method can effectively identify normal versus abnormal characteristics of elasticity in normal and diabetic participants. Conclusions This study verifies the use of the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> method to assess arterial elasticity, and found it to be efficient and simple to use. The <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> method should prove useful not only for improving clinical diagnoses, but also for screening diabetic patients who display early evidence of vascular disease. </p...|$|R

50|$|The force {{measurements}} rely on {{an accurate}} {{value of the}} <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> of the cantilever. This <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> can be measured by different techniques. The thermal noise method is the simplest to use, as it is implemented on most AFMs. This approach relies on {{the determination of the}} mean square amplitude of the cantilever displacement due to spontaneous thermal fluctuations. This quantity is related to the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> by means of the equipartition theorem. In the added mass method one attaches a series of metal beads to the cantilever and each case one determines the resonance frequency. By exploiting the relation for an harmonic oscillator between the resonance frequency and the mass added one can evaluate the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> as well. The frictional force method relies on measurement of the approach and retract curves of the cantilever through a viscous fluid. Since the hydrodynamic drag of a sphere close to a planar substrate is known theoretically, the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> of the cantilever can be deduced. The geometrical method exploits relations between the geometry of the cantilever and its elastic properties.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe single-parameter Γ {{matrix of}} force {{constants}} {{proposed by the}} Gaussian Network Model (GNM) is iteratively modified to yield native state fluctuations that agree exactly with experimentally observed values. The resulting optimized Γ matrix contains residue-specific force constants {{that may be used}} for an accurate analysis of ligand binding to single or multiple sites on proteins. Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI) is used as an example. The calculated off-diagonal elements of the Γ matrix, i. e., the optimized <b>spring</b> <b>constants,</b> obey a Lorentzian distribution. The mean value of the <b>spring</b> <b>constants</b> is ∼− 0. 1, a value much weaker than − 1 of the GNM. Few of the <b>spring</b> <b>constants</b> are positive, indicating repulsion between residues. Residue pairs with large number of neighbors have <b>spring</b> <b>constants</b> around the mean, − 0. 1. Large negative <b>spring</b> <b>constants</b> are between highly correlated pairs of residues.
