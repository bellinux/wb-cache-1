5|$|The Worldwide Tanker Normal Freight Scale, often {{referred}} to as Worldscale, is established and governed jointly by the Worldscale Associations of London and New York. Worldscale establishes a baseline price for carrying a metric ton of product between any two ports in the world. In Worldscale negotiations, operators and charterers will determine a price based on a percentage of the Worldscale rate. The baseline rate is expressed as WS 100. If a given <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> settled on 85% of the Worldscale rate, it would be expressed as WS 85. Similarly, a <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> set at 125% of the Worldscale rate would be expressed as WS 125.|$|E

500|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} any <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> is the freight rate, or the price {{specified}} for carriage of cargo. [...] The freight rate of a tanker <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> is specified in one of four ways: by a lump sum rate, by rate per ton, by a time charter equivalent rate, or by Worldscale rate. In a lump sum rate arrangement, a fixed price is negotiated for the delivery of a specified cargo, and the ship's owner/operator is responsible {{to pay for all}} port costs and other voyage expenses. [...] Rate per ton arrangements are used mostly in chemical tanker chartering, and differ from lump sum rates in that port costs and voyage expenses are generally paid by the charterer. Time charter arrangements specify a daily rate, and port costs and voyage expenses are also generally paid by the charterer.|$|E

500|$|The act {{of hiring}} a ship to carry cargo is called chartering. [...] Tankers are hired by {{four types of}} charter agreements: the voyage charter, the time charter, the bareboat charter, and {{contract}} of affreightment. In a voyage charter the charterer rents the vessel from the loading port to the discharge port. In a time charter the vessel is hired for a set period of time, to perform voyages as the charterer directs. In a bareboat charter the charterer acts as the ship's operator and manager, taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel. Finally, in a contract of affreightment or COA, the charterer specifies a total volume of cargo to be carried in a specific time period and in specific sizes, for example a COA could be specified as [...] of JP-5 in a year's time in [...] shipments. A completed chartering contract {{is known as a}} <b>charter</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Springer {{was elected}} to the Cincinnati city council in 1971. He {{resigned}} in 1974 after admitting to hiring a prostitute. The episode was uncovered when a police raid on a Fort Wright, Kentucky massage parlor found a check Springer had written pinned to a wall in their office with [...] "for services rendered" [...] written in the memo. Springer came clean at a press conference. Long-time Cincinnati newsman Al Schottelkotte pronounced Springer's career over, but Springer's honesty helped him win back his seat in 1975 by a landslide. In a post-election interview, Schottelkotte good-naturedly reminded Springer that he had declared Springer's career over. Springer told the newsman, [...] "I'm glad that you were wrong." [...] In 1977, he was chosen to serve one year as mayor by the City Council. [...] Springer could only serve one year as mayor due to a political arrangement at the time (Cincinnati has since changed to direct election of its mayor) that required the Democrats to split the mayoral term with a local centrist group, the <b>Charter</b> <b>Party,</b> with whom the Democrats governed in an electoral alliance. [...] In the City Council, and as mayor, Springer supported changing the local election system so that council members would be elected by districts (thus better representing neighborhood interests) instead of [...] "9X" [...] at-large system, but his efforts (as well as those of everyone else, to date, who has supported such a change) did not meet with success.|$|E
60|$|From the Brazils, we made {{directly}} over the Atlantic Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope, having a tolerable good voyage, steering {{for the most part}} S.E. We were on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on board, who was to direct all the ship's motions after she arrived at the Cape, only being limited to a certain number of days, for stay, by <b>charter</b> <b>party,</b> at the several ports she was to go to. At the Cape we only took in fresh water, and then sailed for the coast of Coromandel; we were there informed, that a French man of war of 50 guns, and two large merchant ships were sailed for the Indies, but we heard no more of them.|$|E
60|$|Remarkable indeed was the {{behaviour}} of {{the young}} priest. At his entrance on board the ship, he fell on {{his face in the}} most humble prostration to the Almighty. I thought, indeed, he had fallen into a swoon, and so ran to help him up; but he modestly told me, he was returning his thanks to the Almighty, desiring me to leave him a few moments, and that, next to his Creator, he would return me thanks also. And indeed he did so about three minutes after, with great seriousness, and affection, while the tears stood in his eyes, which convinced me of the gratitude of his soul. Nor did he less show his piety and wisdom in applying himself to his country people, and labouring to compose them, by the most powerful reasons, arguments, and persuasions. And when, indeed, these people had taken their night's repose, in such lodgings as our ship would allow, we found nothing but the best of manners, and the most civil acknowledgements, for which the French are eminently remarkable. The next day the Captain and one of the priests desired to speak with me and my nephew the commander. They told us, that they had saved some money and valuable things out of the ruined vessel, which was at our service; only that they desired to be set on shore some where in our way. At the first my nephew was for accepting the money; but I (who knew how hard my case would have been, had the Portuguese Captain served me so) persuaded him to the contrary; and therefore told them, that as we had done nothing but what we were obliged to do, by nature and humanity, and what we ourselves might expect from others in such calamity; so we took them up to save them, not to plunder them, or leave them naked upon the land, to perish for want of subsistance, and therefore would not accept their money: but as to landing them, that was a great difficulty; for being bound to the East Indies, it was impossible wilfully to change our voyage upon their particular account, nor could my nephew (who was under <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> to pursue it by was of Brazil) answer it to the freighters. All that we could do, was to put ourselves in the way of meeting some ships homeward bound from the West Indies, that, if possible, they might get a passage to France or England. Indeed, they were very thankful for our first kindness; but were under great concern, especially the passengers, at their being carried to the East Indies. They begged therefore, I would keep on the banks of Newfoundland, where, probably, they might meet with some ship, or sloop to carry them to Canada, whence they came. As this was but a reasonable request, I was inclined to grant it, since it was no breach of <b>charter</b> <b>party,</b> and that the laws of God and nature obliged us to do what good we could to our fellow-creatures; and besides the danger we ourselves should be in for want of provisions: so we consented to carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would permit; if not, that we should carry them to Martinico in the West Indies. But, as it happened, in a week's time we made the banks of Newfoundland, where the French people hired a bark to carry them to France. But the young priest being desirous to go to the East Indies, I readily agreed to it, because I liked his conversation, and two or three of the French sailors also entered themselves on board our ship.|$|E

40|$|To better {{address the}} <b>charter</b> and <b>party</b> boat fishery {{needs in the}} U. S.

Gulf state <b>charter</b> and <b>party</b> boat operators were interviewed to ascertain {{the extent of their}} social network linkages, membership in community organizations, business community relationships, and linkages to information sources. Approximately one-third to one-half of the <b>charter</b> and <b>party</b> boat operators did not belong to local community organizations that could assist their business through tourism promotion or natural resource protection. Despite their limited integration in the community, the vast majority of operators gave and received referrals from other businesses. Of four major information sources, the National Weather Service and the County Marine Extension agents were rated highest and lowest, respectively, in mean importance to <b>charter</b> and <b>party</b> boat operators. Results suggest that business success can be enhanced by strengthening network ties between operators and local businesses, chambers of commerce, and tourism organizations. For this to occur, individual operators and charter/party boat organizations need to become more effective in representing industry interests. Informational linkages between industry and govemment agencies also need improvement...|$|R
6000|$|I promised {{faithfully}} to {{stay for}} two trips at least, {{and it was in}} those circumstances that what was to be my last connection with a ship began. And after all there was not even one single trip. It may be that it was simply the fulfilment of a fate, of that written word on my forehead which apparently for bade me, through all my sea wanderings, ever to achieve the crossing of the Western Ocean--using the words in that special sense in which sailors speak of Western Ocean trade, of Western Ocean packets, of Western Ocean hard cases. The new life attended closely upon the old, and the nine chapters of [...] "Almayer's Folly" [...] went with me to the Victoria Dock, whence in a few days we started for Rouen. I won't go so far as saying that the engaging of a man fated never to cross the Western Ocean was the absolute cause of the Franco-Canadian Transport Company's failure to achieve even a single passage. It might have been that of course; but the obvious, gross obstacle was clearly the want of money. Four hundred and sixty bunks for emigrants were put together in the 'tween decks by industrious carpenters while we lay in the Victoria Dock, but never an emigrant turned up in Rouen--of which, being a humane person, I confess I was glad. Some gentlemen from Paris--I think there were three of them, and one was said to be the chairman--turned up, indeed, and went from end to end of the ship, knocking their silk hats cruelly against the deck beams. I attended them personally, and I can vouch for it that the interest they took in things was intelligent enough, though, obviously, they had never seen anything of the sort before. Their faces as they went ashore wore a cheerfully inconclusive expression. Notwithstanding that this inspecting ceremony {{was supposed to be a}} preliminary to immediate sailing, it was then, as they filed down our gangway, that I received the inward monition that no sailing within the meaning of our <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> would ever take place.|$|E
