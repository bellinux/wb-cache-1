40|$|SiC whisker {{reinforced}} Fe–Co composites containing up to 3 vol% of bare, copper, Ni–P and cobalt plated whiskers {{were prepared}} in a spark plasma sintering furnace at 900 °C, applying a pressure of 80 MPa for 5 min. The influences of the bare and the coated whisker additions on the magnetic and mechanical {{properties of the}} brittle matrix were assessed and correlated using their microstructural and fractographic observations. The bare whiskers played dual and contradicting roles on the grain growth behaviour of Fe–Co. The insulating fibres, which promoted grain growth of Fe–Co by concentrating the sintering current in the regions away from them, reduced the grain growth kinetics by pinning the boundaries. The grain growth was more pronounced in all the materials with more than 2 vol% of whiskers. Among the coatings investigated, the amorphous Ni–P <b>coating</b> <b>aided</b> to achieve maximum improvements in both strength and ductility by forming nanocrystalline intermetallic compounds with Fe–Co and by promoting dispersion of the whiskers in the matrix alloy.

5000|$|The first type of {{cold saw}} blade, solid HSS, {{may be made}} from either M2 tool steel or M35 tool steel, alloyed with {{additional}} cobalt. Solid HSS saw blades are heat treated and hardened to 64/65 HRC for ferrous cutting applications and 58/60 HRC for non-ferrous cutting applications. This high hardness gives the cutting edges of the teeth a high resistance to heat and wear. However, this increased hardness also makes the blades brittle and not very resistant to shock. In order to produce a high quality HSS cold saw blade, you must start with very flat and properly tensioned raw material.

40|$|Composite {{strengthening}} was {{attempted to}} improve the mechanical strength and toughness of the brittle near equiatomic Fe-Co alloy. The matrix alloy chosen for this research falls in the Fe-(30 - 50) Co group, which {{are known for their}} highest saturation induction (B-sat) and Curie temperature among the commercial soft magnetic alloys. The reinforcements, which exhibited a wide range of aspect ratios, included SiC particulates, SiC whiskers and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In order to minimize the interfacial reaction between the reinforcements and the Fe- 50 Co alloy (matrix) and to realise higher compact density, spark plasma sintering (SPS) was selected for rapid compaction of materials. Reinforcements were coated using electroless deposition with Ni-P, copper and cobalt to modify the interfacial chemistry and thickness, and hence the final properties of the composites. A comprehensive study on the sintering variables found, within the range of examination and under constant heating and cooling rates, the optimum maximum temperature, soaking time and mechanical pressure of 900 oC, 2 - 5 minutes and 80 MPa to rapidly consolidate the Fe- 50 Co alloy to near-theoretical density. The volume fraction and size of the ordered regions in the monolithic alloy and hence the magnetic properties, were sensitive to the heating rate, cooling rate, temperature at which the mechanical pressure was applied and removed and post heat treatments. The influence of reinforcement coatings on the wetting characteristics, and in turn the properties, was compared using SiC particulate Fe- 50 Co composites. The introduction of bare and coarse (20 μm) SiC particulates negatively affected both magnetic and mechanical properties. Electroless Co coating of particulates improved both the flexural properties and magnetic characteristics such as permeability and coercivity by promoting the formation of narrower interfaces and better bonding. The addition of bare and coated whiskers in Fe-Co alloys enhanced densification and grain growth of the matrix. Copper coating over whiskers was found to be not helpful in realising uniform dispersion, whereas Co and Ni-P <b>coating</b> <b>aided</b> to achieve uniform dispersion of whiskers in the matrix. The amorphous Ni-P coating on whiskers was nanocrystallised during the rapid sintering process and resulted in a material with highly improved mechanical strength and ductility in comparison to the monolithic and other whisker reinforced composite materials.

Despite the fundamental role of such receptors in protein sorting, only a few have been identified. To further define the machinery that packages secretory cargo and targets proteins from the ER to Golgi membranes, we used multiple systematic approaches, which revealed 2 uncharacterized proteins that mediate the trafficking and maturation of Pma 1, the essential yeast plasma membrane proton ATPase.

40|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) {{is the site}} of synthesis of secreted and membrane proteins. To exit the ER, proteins are packaged into COPII vesicles through direct interaction with the COPII <b>coat</b> or <b>aided</b> by specific cargo receptors. Despite the fundamental role of such cargo receptors in protein traffic, only a few have been identified; their cargo spectrum is unknown and the signals they recognize remain poorly understood. We present here an approach we term "PAIRS" (pairing analysis of cargo receptors), which combines systematic genetic manipulations of yeast with automated microscopy screening, to map the spectrum of cargo for a known receptor or to uncover a novel receptor for a particular cargo. Using PAIRS we followed the fate of ∼ 150 cargos on the background of mutations in nine putative cargo receptors and identified novel cargo for most of these receptors. Deletion of the Erv 14 cargo receptor affected the widest range of cargo. Erv 14 substrates have a wide array of functions and structures; however, they are all membrane-spanning proteins of the late secretory pathway or plasma membrane. Proteins residing in these organelles have longer transmembrane domains (TMDs). Detailed examination of one cargo supported the hypothesis that Erv 14 dependency reflects the length rather than the sequence of the TMD. The PAIRS approach allowed us to uncover new cargo for known cargo receptors and to obtain an unbiased look at specificity in cargo selection. Obtaining the spectrum of cargo for a cargo receptor allows a novel perspective on its mode of action. The rules that appear to guide Erv 14 substrate recognition suggest that sorting of membrane proteins at multiple points in the secretory pathway could depend on the physical properties of TMDs. Such a mechanism would allow diverse proteins to utilize a few receptors without the constraints of evolving location-specific sorting motifs...|$|R

Within this field, advances in nanoparticle research have rendered them attractive candidates for drug delivery. Consequently, controlling the chemistry that occurs at the nanoparticle interface influences {{the efficiency of the}} drug-delivery system. In this review, we explore the role of coating materials, in the form of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), in enhancing the interfacial properties of nanoparticles. We discuss how SAMs enhance the properties of particles, such as stability and dispersibility, as well as provide a platform for delivering biomolecules and other therapeutic agents. In addition, we describe recent methods for generating nanoparticles with targeted surface functionality using custom-designed SAMs. These functionalities offer marked advances to the three stages of a drug-delivery system: loading, delivery, and release of therapeutic molecules.

Using synthetic spider silk protein produced from the purification of transgenic goat 2 ̆ 7 s milk it is possible to coat many different materials with varying success. Stainless steel and silicone can be coated using the synthetic protein and these materials make up a wide variety of biomedical implants and are used in most invasive procedures. Coated implants drastically reduce the risk of infection as well as bring down recovery time.

40|$|Biofouling is the {{accumulation}} of sessile marine organisms, such as algae, tube worms and barnacles on man-made substrata and has negative economic and ecological implications. Ship hulls are readily fouled, which significantly increases drag while decreasing ship fuel efficiency when moving through water. Fouled hulls have also become important vectors of invasive species. These problems are minimized when hulls are painted with a toxic anti-fouling or non-toxic foul-release coating. Due to recent restrictions of anti-fouling paint use, {{research and development of}} non-toxic alternatives has increased. Novel hull coating efficiency is often quantified by the critical removal stress value of barnacles from the coating. Barnacle adhesive cement protein content is thought to be responsible for barnacles’ incredible ability to adhere underwater. The expression level and type of adhesive proteins has eluded scientists due to their extreme insolubility within cured barnacle cement. Identification of these proteins may provide insight to the adhesion of fouling species and <b>aid</b> <b>coating</b> development. Barnacles are a cosmopolitan organism, able to withstand a wide range of environmental conditions, yet foul-release coating research had not previously incorporated environmental factors as variables in determining coating performance.

Even so, the interaction between temperature and barnacle adhesion to has not previously been explored. We examined the effect of temperature on barnacle adhesion to foul-release coatings. After observing differences in critical removal stress due to temperature, we attempted to attribute these differences to specific proteins within the adhesive using 2 D SDS PAGE. Gel image analysis determined that there were significant differences in cement protein expression between barnacles raised within different temperatures.

40|$|According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), probiotics {{are defined}} as ‘‘live {{microorganisms}} which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit for the host’’ (FAO/WHO, 2001). Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria are two major group of organisms considered to have probiotic properties. Probiotic bacteria are accepted universally for conferring beneficial effects to human gut health. However, the successful delivery of these bacteria to the human intestine via a proper food matrix is challenging because the stresses encountered by the probiotics during processing, storage and gastric transition cause major loss of viability. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to develop a novel protection system using a complexation product of dairy protein and a bacterial exo-polysaccharide which should be able to protect the probiotic bacteria during their gastric transit and also release them under suitable conditions in the intestine. Lactobacillus casei 431, a commercial strain from Chr Hansen, Denmark, was chosen as the experimental strain and the protein-polysaccharide complex was made up of sodium caseinate and gellan gum. Gelation of the sodium caseinate and gellan gum mixture was achieved by a gradual decrease of pH with slow hydrolysis of glucono-delta-lactone (GDL) and Lactobacillus casei 431 cells were successfully entrapped into this gel matrix. An intermediate step of forming a water-in-oil emulsion was involved in this process for producing micron level gel particles. The appropriate combination of ingredients, based on final elastic modulus to attain adequate gel strength, was finally decided as 10 % (w/w) sodium caseinate, 0. 25 % (w/w) gellan gum and 2. 5 % (w/w) GDL. This combination resulted in a very fine and uniform capsule size distribution and up to 89 % encapsulation efficiency was achieved. The gelled microcapsules were freeze dried to obtain better shelf stability and easy handling properties. The particles obtained had diameters ranging from 40 to 1100 μm for wet and 46 to 631 μm for freeze dried microcapsules. The mean diameters (D 32) of wet and freeze dried microcapsules were found as 287 and 152 μm, respectively. II Scanning electron microscopic examination of the freeze dried particles showed irregular surfaces and the presence of numorous pores. Tolerance of free and encapsulated bacterial cells in simulated gastric juice at pH 2. 0 was tested in an in vitro model and the results showed better survivability of encapsulated cells in both wet and dry microcapsules as compared to the free cells. The log CFU reduction figures after a 2 hour incubation period, were 4. 56 for free cells, 3. 03 for cells inside wet capsules and 2. 28 for cells protected inside freeze dried particles. Incubation of free and encapsulated cells in the presence of 1 % (w/v) bile extract for 8 hours showed 2. 51 log CFU/gm reductions for free cells with almost no detrimental effect on wet microencapsulated cells and 2. 44 log CFU reductions for freeze dried cells. Further research work was undertaken to improve the post freeze drying survivability of the L. casei 431 cells by including cryoprotective solutes in both the culture growth and the drying media. Trehalose and lactose were chosen as cryoprotecting agents. Compared to an average 1. 70 log CFU reduction in case of control (no cryoprotectant) samples, trehalose and lactose containing samples both showed a much better survival rate; only 0. 84 and 0. 37 log CFU/gm reduction respectively, in cell population, were recorded. A membrane coating over the produced microcapsules was applied and the properties of such coated samples were checked separately. The <b>coating</b> process <b>aided</b> in the post drying survivability and only 0. 53 and 0. 13 log CFU/gm reductions were recorded for trehalose and lactose supplemented samples, respectively. The presence of cryoprotecting compounds proved to be beneficial against the simulated gastric environment and the membrane coating gave additional improvement in this regard. During the gastric fluid incubation tests, cryoprotected samples (freeze dried) containing trehalose and lactose shown a higher survival of 3. 13 log CFU/gm and 2. 04 log CFU/gm respectively, compared to cells in free form. Improvements offered by the membrane coating were recorded as an additional 0. 23 log CFU/gm and 0. 66 log CFU/gm higher survival for trehalose and lactose respectively. The same trend was observed for bile salt tolerance also. Cryoprotected samples (freeze dried) containing trehalose and lactose showed a higher survival of 0. 41 log CFU/gm and 0. 84 log CFU/gm respectively, compared to cells in free form. Additionally, the membrane coating process contributed III towards further improvement in viability of 0. 25 log CFU/gm and 0. 26 log CFU/gm for trehalose and lactose respectively. Overall, lactose has been found to be a marginally better protectant of cells than trehalose against freeze drying, acid and bile salt stresses. The membrane coating process helped in forming a very smooth surface morphology devoid of any visible pores. Perhaps the presence of a membrane coating was responsible for this better protective nature of coated microcapsules. But as a drawback, this coating process resulted into higher particle mean diameters, both for wet and freeze dried beads. Storage of freeze dried samples at 37 °C proved to be more detrimental to the entrapped cells than at 4 °C. But the results obtained were better compared to the situation where no protective compounds were used. It was found that lactose and trehalose helped in maintaining high levels of viable cell populations during the storage period but the cell degradation rate was positively correlated with the storage temperature. Therefore, it can be concluded that a low pH sodium caseinate-gellan gum gel matrix can offer adaptation and protection to the probiotic cells before encountering a high acid stomach environment and therefore can be utilized as an effective microencapsulation technique. The survibility of the L. casei 431 cells could be further improved during freeze drying as well as gastrointestinal transit by incorporation of protectants, viz., lactose or trehalose and applying a membrane coating of gellan gum. High acid food preparations such as, yogurt and fruit juice could be the probable applications for the current findings...|$|R
