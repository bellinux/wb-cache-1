50|$|Tokens {{must be used}} as {{reinforcers}} to be effective. A token is {{an object}} or symbol that can be exchanged for material reinforcers, services, or privileges (back-up reinforcers). In applied settings, {{a wide range of}} tokens have been used: coins, <b>checkmarks,</b> images of small suns, phallus pictures, points on a counter. These symbols and objects are comparably worthless outside of the patient-clinician relationship, but their value {{lies in the fact that}} they can be exchanged for other things. Technically speaking, tokens are not primary reinforcers, but secondary or learned reinforcers. Much research has been conducted on token reinforcement, including animal studies.|$|E

5000|$|Legal {{professionals}} {{predicted that}} this decision might impact the future design of {{terms of use}} agreements particularly for e-commerce sites, rather than business-to-business sites. [...] The court's decision to include {{a reference to the}} [...] "courts' traditional reluctance to enforce browsewrap agreements against individual consumers" [...] indicated that this case would particularly impact consumer-facing businesses. [...] At the time, it led to legal professionals recommending that e-commerce sites consider adding clear manifestations of consent - like <b>checkmarks</b> - or text clearly stating that continued use of the site would be interpreted as the user's consent to the terms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{game was}} played with two boards (with twelve correct answers and four Wipeouts in each). The correct answers were {{indicated}} by <b>checkmarks</b> and the Wipeouts were indicated by crosses. In the beginning, the crosses appeared after an explosion; later they appear {{in a variety of}} ways. Correct answers were worth 25 points each in board one and 50 points each in board two. Also, after an answer, play immediately went to the next contestant. In addition, the [...] "Hot Spot" [...] was simply called the [...] "Bonus" [...] but otherwise acted the same. The lowest scoring contestant is eliminated {{at the end of the}} round. If the round ended in a tie, the tied contestants were then shown a tiebreaker board with 12 answers arranged in a frame. Eight were right, and four were wrong. The tied contestants (starting with the player who won the coin toss) went back and forth picking answers until one contestant wiped out. The first contestant to wipe out was eliminated from the game, and the other player advanced to the next round.|$|E
50|$|Pre-assessment {{should always}} be {{evaluated}} but never with grades (Rice, 2013). Teachers should use <b>checkmarks,</b> symbols and highlighter to help find where the students need the most instruction. These assessments {{should be used to}} create teachers lesson plans and help the teacher find the best approach for the new unit. The best way to assess is to use graphic organizers, which will be described greater detail below. Evaluation is an ongoing process throughout the school year. As the students learn and grow so will their knowledge and abilities. There was a study done about India curriculum and that evaluated the effectiveness of pre- and post- assessment. Overall the findings showed that pre- and post assessment had a positive effect on the students learning. The student had increased their average score 11% from the pre-assessment to post. In pre-assessment they were given a subjective method of asking what they already know or do not know about the subject. They also were given an assessment that was an objective method that asked yes/no questions. For example, was the information was easy to understand, useful, and well organized.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two ways}} that Speechranks {{measures}} student participation: Points and Green Check Marks. Points are awarded to competitors based on the student’s percentile finish in each event. Students achieving the same percentile finish in any event and any tournament will be awarded {{the same number of}} Points. A student’s three best finishes in a particular event are used to sum their total Points for that event. Overall ranking on Speechranks is determined {{by the total number of}} Points a competitor has accumulated. Green Check Marks recognize consistent excellence throughout the competitive season. There is no limit to the number of Green Check Marks a student may earn. In general, Green Check Marks are awarded to any competitor who achieves a winning record in debate or finishes in the top 40% of an individual event (IE). Green Check Marks are unique to each event and students may not transfer <b>checkmarks</b> from one event to another. Speechranks requirements were drafted by Isaiah McPeak, with development chaired by Dr. Van Schalin and programmed by Connor McKay. It utilizes the Ruby Programming Language, the same language Stoa uses for membership and tournament registration.|$|E
40|$|Handling full {{permutations}} of {{the candidate}} list along with re-encryption mixes is rather difficult in Prêt à Voter but handling cyclic shifts is straightforward. One of the versions of Prêt à Voter that uses Paillier encryption allows general permutations of candidates on the ballot, rather than just cyclic shifts. This improves the robustness of the system against an adversary who tries to alter <b>checkmarks</b> on ballots before they are posted to the bulletin board. Even if the adversary could predict which voters would fail to check their vote on the bulletin board, {{the best they could}} do would be to choose another random candidate. By contrast, when using only cyclic shifts the adversary can systematically shift a biased distribution from one candidate to another. We show in this note that the Paillier version of Prêt à Voter with full permutations {{of the candidate}}s is not receipt-free when the number of possible permutations is much larger than the number of voters, and we propose a construction that addresses this issue while retaining the defence against an adversary who can shift <b>checkmarks.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Using René Magritte’s {{well-known}} painting The Treachery of Images (This {{is not a}} pipe), {{we argue}} that the current focus on competencies throughout medical education can sometimes lead educators to rely too heavily on scores, <b>checkmarks,</b> {{or other forms of}} assessment that come to be viewed as equivalents for the actual existence of what is being measured. Magritte insisted that the image he created on the canvas was not a pipe but rather a representation of a pipe, an important distinction for educators to remember as we seek ways to evaluate trainees’ attainment of the fundamental knowledge and skills of the profession. We also urge that the focus on broader skills, values, flexibility, reflection, and insight development should fall outside the net of a competency orientation in a supportive environment spared from traditional assessment methods, using a classroom in undergraduate medical education as an example of working toward this end...|$|E
40|$|Particle size {{distribution}} {{of raw materials}} {{plays an important role}} in extrusion process during direct expanded extrudates manufacturing. In most of the food industries all types of fl ours come in a production plant packed in bags with certain <b>checkmarks</b> that consist of average size of particles expressed in μm. Th at particle size range is very relative, because mostly it means that size of most frequent particles is expressed. During extrusion processing of corn fl our and whey or soy proteins blends are interject, then it is very important to know precise particle size of the interjected blends. If it does not match, raw materials should be sieved and particular fractions separated. To obtain the best fraction of corn fl our for extrusion processing (200 – 450 μm), sieving was conducted in shaker “Analysette 3 ” with sieving times of 5, 10 and 15 minutes. For each of these three measurements an agglomerate creation was spotted, followed by the major remain of the sample at the mesh of 450 μm. Sieving was repeated with aid of ultrasound (250 W), using power generator and by ultrasonic ring with transducer (“UIS 250 L”) mounted on the sieves. Sieving was conducted again with sieving times of 5, 10 and 15 minutes, and variable amplitude of works of 25, 50 and 75 % for ultrasound. Within each of these nine measurements a partial or complete agglomerate breakdown was achieved, and an optimal fraction for extrusion processing was acquired. For the desirable particle size fraction in range of 200 – 450 μm for extrusion, under the conditions of 10 and 15 minutes of sieving time with amplitude work of 75 %, the most of the sample remained within desirable range (83, 79 % and 83. 4 %) ...|$|E
