40|$|Many {{mechanical}} systems {{rely on the}} principle of mechanical energy being converted to heat via frictional work, such as brakes and clutches. The demand for increased performance raises the issue of effectively predicting the behaviour. In this paper two mathematical models - a one-dimensional pin and a two-dimensional finite element model - are compared in the context of thermo elastic instability of sliding contact. The material parameters that are investigated are the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear,</b> thermal dilatation and the specific heat. Both models incorporate temperature dependant wear and friction and exhibit similar response to changes in material parameters and can be used for analysing thermo elastic contact problems. A single value measure has been constructed that quantifies the deviation from evenly distributed contact pressure. Calculating this measure for different values of material parameters has been used to compare the two models. This comparison revealed a difference between the models and to achieve the same evolution of the pressure distribution, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> was changed by a factor of three. When analysing the response to other material properties correction for this discrepancy was made, and the models then showed good agreement...|$|E

40|$|Wear {{experiments}} were conducted using replication electron microscopy and reflection electron diffraction to study abrasion and deformed layers produced in single-crystal Mn-Zn ferrites under three-body abrasion. The abrasion mechanism of Mn-Zn ferrite changes drastically {{with the size}} of abrasive grits. With 15 -micron (1000 -mesh) SiC grits, abrasion of Mn-Zn ferrite is due principally to brittle fracture; while with 4 - and 2 -micron (4000 - and 6000 -mesh) SiC grits, abrasion is due to plastic deformation and fracture. Both microcracking and plastic flow produce polycrystalline states on the wear surfaces of single-crystal Mn-Zn ferrites. <b>Coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear,</b> total thickness of the deformed layers, and surface roughness of the wear surfaces increase markedly with an increase in abrasive grit size. The total thicknesses of the deformed layers are 3 microns for the ferrite abraded by 15 -micron SiC, 0. 9 microns for the ferrite abraded by 4 -micron SiC, and 0. 8 microns for the ferrite abraded by 1 -micron SiC...|$|E
40|$|The {{handling}} of iron ore bulk solids maintains an increasing trend due to economic development. Because iron ore particles have hard composites and irregular shapes, the bulk solids handling equipment surface can suffer from severe sliding <b>wear.</b> Prediction <b>of</b> equipment surface <b>wear</b> volume is {{beneficial to the}} efficient maintenance <b>of</b> <b>worn</b> areas. Archard’s equation provides a theoretical solution to predict wear volume. To use Archard’s equation, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> sliding <b>wear</b> must be determined. To our best knowledge, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> sliding <b>wear</b> for iron ore handling conditions {{has not yet been}} determined. In this research, using a pin-on-disk tribometer, the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> sliding <b>wear</b> for both Sishen particles and mild steel are determined with regard to iron ore handling conditions. Both naturally irregular and spherical shapes of particles are used to estimate average values <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> rate. Moreover, the hardness and inner structures of Sishen particles are examined, which adds the evidence of the interpretation <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> results. It is concluded that the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> sliding <b>wear</b> can vary largely for both Sishen particle and mild steel. The wear rate decreases from transient- to steady-state. The average <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> sliding <b>wear</b> is capable <b>of</b> predicting <b>wear</b> with respect to long distances at the steady-state.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Hard anodising on aluminium and its alloys has been widely practised {{for many years in}} order to improve the resistance of the otherwise poor wear characteristics of aluminium. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in other treatments and coatings, on both aluminium and other base metals. The aim of this investigation is to explain the tribological performance and wear mechanism(s) of an uncoated aluminium alloy, four anodic coated alloys, and also an electroless nickel alloy. All of the coatings are produced on three different aluminium alloys. The thickness of the anodic films is 30 - 35 micron, as this thickness falls within the range commonly used by industry. In an endeavour to explain the role of coating thickness on wear life, electroless nickel alloy has been produced in a range of thicknesses of 10, 20 and 30 micron. To evaluate abrasive and adhesive wear, the samples were rubbed against a single point diamond and steel ball, respectively, in a reciprocating movement at room temperature and 65 - 75 % relative humidity, under a wide range of load and sliding distance. Some tests continued to run until a breakdown of the coatings occurred, whilst other tests were interrupted at intermediate stages. This enabled the initiation and propagation of failure mechanisms to be studied. Abrasive wear was performed under dry conditions, whereas, adhesive wear was evaluated under both dry and lubricated conditions. Wear of these coatings was proportional to the applied load and sliding distance, but there was no direct relationship between wear and hardness. The tribological performance of these coatings appears to be dictated by a) the composition of the substrate, b) the chemical and physical nature of the coatings and c) the test conditions. Under boundary lubricated conditions there was a considerable increase in the wear life of the coatings. A three dimensional surface texture is superior to a machined surface, in controlling contact conditions. There is an approximate linear relationship between coating thickness and wear life for electroless nickel alloys. These coatings predominantly fail by adhesion, plastic deformation and brittle fracture. A microscopic model for fracture of brittle materials, under both static and dynamic conditions for abrasive and adhesive wear correlates very well with the behaviour of these coatings. Analytical interpretation of adhesive wear was made by separately calculating the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> "K" of the counterbodies. This information enables an improved understanding of the wear test itself {{to be added to the}} model of the wear mechanisms involved...|$|E

40|$|To {{predict the}} {{reliability}} of a system, an engineer might allocate a distribution to each input. This raises a question: how to select the correct distribution? Siddall put forward an evolutionary approach that was intended to utilise both {{the understanding of the}} engineer and available data. However, this method requires a subjective initial distribution based on the engineer's understanding of the variable or parameter. If the engineer's understanding is limited, the initial distribution will be misrepresentative of the actual distribution, and application of the method will likely fail. To provide some assistance, the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> friction and <b>wear</b> are considered here. Basic tribology theory, dimensional issues and the central limit theorem are used to argue that the distribution for each <b>of</b> the <b>coefficients</b> will typically be like a lognormal distribution. Empirical evidence from other sources is cited to lend support to this argument. It is concluded that the distributions for the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> friction and <b>wear</b> would typically be lognormal in nature.

40|$|A {{significant}} part of maintenance costs in urban rail systems (metro, tram, light rapid transit/light metro) is due to wheel-rail wear. Wear rates - measured for example as depth <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> per kilometre run (rolling stock) or per train passage (rails) - depend in a complex manner on several influence factors. Among the most important are key design factors of the rolling stock (wheel profiles, suspension characteristics), of the track (distribution of curve radii, characteristics of switches and crossings, rail profiles), of the wheel-rail interface (lubrication, materials in contact, ambient characteristics), and of operations (frequency of traction and braking, trainset inversion policy, maintenance policy etc.). When designing an urban rail system, {{all of these factors}} have to be under control in order to limit the costs due to wheel/rail reprofiling/grinding and replacement. The state of the art allows the calculation <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> rates given quantitative input regarding the above factors.

40|$|The use of {{nanopowder}} in ship repairing processes {{with the}} purpose of in-creasing plasma surface durability is considered. The results of research of prop-erties of mating friction pairs, received by plasma covering with application of nanomaterial – fullerene are given. These results show that <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> fric-tion and <b>wearing</b> are decreasing especially with application of fullerene on both surfaces; while prolonged testing fullerenes are taken out of surface with law roughness; with application of fullerene on the surface of plasma covering with 10 % porosity the durability of friction unit is increasing...|$|R
