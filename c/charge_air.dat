CuproBraze is particularly suited for <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> coolers and radiators in capital intensive industries where machinery must operate {{for long periods}} of time under harsh conditions without premature failures. For these reasons, CuproBraze is particularly suited for the off-road vehicle, truck, bus, industrial engine, generator, locomotive, and military equipment markets. The technology is also amenable for light trucks, SUVs and passenger cars.|$|E
25|$|Turbocharger units {{often make}} use of an {{intercooler}} (also known as a <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> cooler), to cool down the intake air.

25|$|In {{the case}} of Electro-Motive Diesel's {{two-stroke}} engines, the mechanically assisted turbocharger is not specifically a twincharger, as the engine uses the mechanical assistance to <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> only at lower engine speeds and startup. Once above notch # 5, the engine uses true turbocharging. This differs from a turbocharger that uses the compressor section of the turbo-compressor only during starting and, as a two-stroke engines cannot naturally aspirate, and, according to SAE definitions, a two-stroke engine with a mechanically assisted compressor during idle and low throttle is considered naturally aspirated.|$|E
25|$|Some organizations, such as hospitals, {{often provide}} a single type of service, such as neonatal, while leaving others {{to provide the}} balance of services. How the service is {{actually}} provided, {{and the level of}} service that is provided, can vary from a region to another, although basic standards are quite the same. Emergency service in Italy is always free of <b>charge.</b> <b>Air</b> ambulance services are normally provided by the same regional authorities with a network of dedicated helicopters, or as an added service from a number of other government agencies, including the Italian Coast Guard, Civil Defence, and the Vigili del Fuoco (firefighters).|$|E
500|$|The test {{series was}} given the secret codename Operation Grapple. Rear Admiral [...] Kaye Edden, the Commandant of the Joint Services Staff College was {{approached}} to be the Task Force Commander (TFC), but {{he pointed out that}} the test series would primarily be a Royal Air Force (RAF) responsibility, {{and that it would be}} more appropriate to have an RAF officer in <b>charge.</b> <b>Air</b> Commodore Wilfrid Oulton was appointed task force commander on 6 February 1956, with the acting rank of air vice marshal from 1 March 1956. He secured Group Captain Richard Gething as his chief of staff.|$|E

500|$|Hansell, at {{the request}} of Major General Dwight D. Eisenhower, was {{assigned}} on July 12, 1942 as Officer in <b>Charge,</b> <b>Air</b> Section, ETOUSA headquarters, and simultaneously as deputy theater air officer for Major General Carl A. Spaatz, commander of the Eighth Air Force. [...] His duties were to mold Eisenhowerâ€™s opinion on the use of airpower, guided by Spaatz, but there is little indication that he succeeded. [...] He also flew combat in a B-17 to gain first-hand experience with daylight precision bombing, attacking the Longueau marshalling yard at Amiens, France, on August 20, 1942. During the mission he developed frostbite on his hands and spent several days recovering from the effects.|$|E
500|$|De La Rue and {{his staff}} at Headquarters Richmond worked [...] "flat out" [...] in the days prior the {{outbreak}} of World WarII to get the base to a fit state of readiness and, immediately after hostilities were declared on 3September, to liaise with the Central War Room in Melbourne passing instructions to squadrons. The following day, Richmond's first wartime sortie took place, a flight of three Avro Ansons and three Supermarine Seagulls patrolling the ocean off Sydney. Within a month the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Vice Marshal Goble, proposed despatching a six-squadron air expeditionary force to Great Britain, with De La Rue, then the RAAF's seventh most senior officer, in <b>charge.</b> <b>Air</b> Marshal Richard Williams, Goble's long-time rival for leadership of the Air Force in the 1920s and '30s, later contended that the CAS was unduly favouring his fellow RNAS veteran and seaplane specialist to lead {{what would have been}} the RAAF's largest formation to date, particularly considering that other contenders for the role such as Group Captains Cole, Frank McNamara, and Henry Wrigley had greater landplane experience than De La Rue. The concept was in any case abandoned soon after, as Australia concentrated on participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme. Some time {{in the latter half of}} 1940, De La Rue was seeing dinner guests off the base at RAAF Richmond, and attempted to re-enter the perimeter via the main gate. Wearing civilian clothes and without his security pass, he was challenged and then locked up by the guards, who did not recognise him or believe his assurances that he was their commander. De La Rue was finally released by the orderly officer but was still fuming the next morning; only the advice of the base warrant officer (disciplinary), who had congratulated the guards on their diligence, prevented the CO from taking action against all concerned.|$|E

[...] The Eighth Air Force was experiencing high altitude and cold weather issues which, while not unique to the aircraft, were perhaps more severe as the turbo-superchargers upgrading the Allisons were having their own reliability issues making the aircraft more unpopular with senior officers out of the line. This was a situation unduplicated on all other fronts where the commands were clamoring for as many P-38s as they could get. Both the P-38G and P-38H models' performance was restricted by an intercooler system integral to the wing's leading edge which had been designed for the YP-38's less powerful engines. At the higher boost levels, the new engine's <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> temperature would increase above the limits recommended by Allison and {{would be subject to}} detonation if operated at high power for extended periods of time. [...] Reliability was not the only issue, either. [...] For example, the reduced power settings required by the P-38H did not allow the maneuvering flap to be used to good advantage at high altitude. [...] All these problems really came to a head in the unplanned P-38H and sped the Lightning's eventual replacement in the Eighth Air Force; fortunately the Fifteenth Air Force were glad to get them.|$|E

6000|$|... 1173. I carried these {{experiments}} on with air {{to a very}} great extent. I had a chamber built, being a cube of twelve feet. A slight cubical wooden frame was constructed, and copper wire passed along and across it in various directions, {{so as to make}} the sides a large net-work, and then all was covered in with paper, placed in close connexion with the wires, and supplied in every direction with bands of tin foil, that the whole might be brought into good metallic communication, and rendered a free conductor in every part. This chamber was insulated in the lecture-room of the Royal Institution; a glass tube about six feet in length was passed through its side, leaving about four feet within and two feet on the outside, and through this a wire passed from the large electrical machine (290.) to the air within. By working the machine, the air in this chamber could be brought into what is considered a highly electrified state (being, in fact, the same state as that of the air of a room in which a powerful machine is in operation), {{and at the same time}} the outside of the insulated cube was everywhere strongly charged. But putting the chamber in communication with the perfect discharging train described in a former series (292.), and working the machine so as to bring the air within to its utmost degree of charge if I quickly cut off the connexion with the machine, and at the same moment or instantly after insulated the cube, the air within had not the least power to communicate a further charge to it. If any portion of the air was electrified, as glass or other insulators may be charged (1171.), it was accompanied by a corresponding opposite action within the cube, the whole effect being merely a case of induction. Every attempt to <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> bodily and independently with the least portion of either electricity failed.|$|E
50|$|Present-day <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> cooler systems, {{based on}} {{aluminium}} alloys, experience durability problems at temperatures and pressures necessary {{to meet the}} U.S. Tier 4i standards for stationary and mobile engines. Published reports estimate that the average life of an aluminium <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> cooler is currently only about 3,500 hours. Aluminium is near its upper technological limit to accommodate higher temperatures and thermal stress levels because the tensile strength of the metal declines rapidly at 150Â°C and repetitive thermal cycling between 150Â°C and 200Â°C substantially weakens it. Thermal cycling creates weak spots in aluminium tubes, which in turn causes <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> coolers to fail prematurely. A potential option is to install stainless steel precoolers in aluminium <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> coolers, but limited space and the complexity of this solution is a hampering factor for this option.|$|E
