50|$|The {{standard}} Teletype {{three-row keyboard}} is expanded on the Model 28 {{with the addition}} of special keys, normally colored red, which allow the operator to <b>control</b> <b>keyboard</b> line break, keyboard lock and unlock, repeat operation, and local carriage return and local line feed. The keyboard base, with the attached motor unit and typing unit, is pivotally mounted a cradle within the cabinet and swings outward for maintenance. Unlike previous machines, all mechanical controls, such as the Model 15 manual platen crank, are brought to the front so that machines can be positioned side-by-side in rows. Electrical accessories, such as the line relays, motor relays and power fuses are mounted in a separate removable chassis called the Electrical Service Unit. A separate shelf is available in the console base for ancillary equipment such as rectifiers and is also used to store local installation documentation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{currents}} induced {{in the human}} body when exposed to extremely low frequency (60 Hz) electric fields by numerical modelling with boundary elements. The exposure is driven by the voltage of a rectangular panel representing the <b>control</b> <b>keyboard</b> of a power substation room. The main focus is to study the variations of the current density {{in the human body}} when located at different distances from the panel. In addition, the sensitivity of the results for the current density when considering the human body with and without its inter-nal organs is estimated. The numerical approach is based on the three dimensional boundary element method (BEM) with the kernel of Laplace equation, in which the human body model considered is a simplified representation which allows para-metric modifications of its geometry and physical properties...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} issue of gender {{differences}} in computer-based foreign language activities. The experiment, conducted at the University of Arizona in the Fall of 1992, used as subjects students (N = 60) enrolled in intermediate French classes. Students were assigned to mixed- or same-gender dyads. All dyads engaged in a French cooperative task at the computer. The software-based pre- and posttests were composed of two parts: (1) vocabulary pertaining to description of people, and (2) geographical knowledge. Gain scores indicated {{no significant difference in}} overall learning between genders and dyad types. Further analysis of subscores revealed that females outperformed males significantly (p =. 02) in learning vocabulary pertaining to description of people. Males outperformed females numerically in learning geographical facts. Differences between mixed- and same-gender dyads suggest that females tend to acquiesce to male factual preferences in mixed-gender dyads. The analysis of interaction patterns at the computer revealed that females tended to share <b>keyboard</b> <b>control</b> more than males in same-gender dyads. And, males tended to use more management statements with female partners than with male partners. Results from the MBTI personality test indicated that males and females tended to have different learning profiles. The analysis of gain scores indicated that overall, NFs and NTs learned significantly more than STs. Personality profiles also showed a significant effect (p =. 03) on <b>keyboard</b> <b>control.</b> EJs <b>controlled</b> the <b>keyboard</b> significantly more than the other types. Likewise, results revealed a significant effect of personalities on overall amount of talk (p =. 04), management statements (p =. 02), and task statements (p =. 06). EJs spoke more and used more management statements than the other types when in <b>control</b> of the <b>keyboard.</b> When not in <b>control</b> of the <b>keyboard,</b> EPs and IJs spoke more than the other types. Interestingly 'non-keyboard controllers' tended to compensate for the lack of <b>keyboard</b> <b>control</b> with verbal control. The overall results of this study established that learning achievement and interaction patterns were more strongly related to personality differences than to gender differences...|$|R
