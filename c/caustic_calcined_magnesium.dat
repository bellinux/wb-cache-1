50|$|Eco-Cement is a brand-name for a type {{of cement}} which {{incorporates}} reactive magnesia (sometimes called <b>caustic</b> <b>calcined</b> magnesia or <b>magnesium</b> oxide, MgO), another hydraulic cement such as Portland cement, and optionally pozzolans and industrial by-products, to reduce the environmental impact relative to conventional cement. One problem with the commercialization of this cement, other than the conservatism of the building industry, is that the feedstock magnesite is rarely mined.|$|R
50|$|Reactive {{magnesia}} is also variously {{known as}} <b>caustic</b> <b>calcined</b> magnesia, <b>caustic</b> magnesia or CCM. The temperature of firing {{has a greater}} influence on reactivity than grind size as excess energy goes into lattice energy.|$|R

50|$|Calcining at {{different}} temperatures produces magnesium oxide of different reactivity. High temperatures 1500 - 2000 °C diminish the available surface area and produces dead-burned (often called dead burnt) magnesia, an unreactive form {{used as a}} refractory. Calcining temperatures 1000 - 1500 °C produce hard-burned magnesia, which has limited reactivity and calcining at lower temperature, (700-1000 °C) produces light-burned magnesia, a reactive form, also known as <b>caustic</b> <b>calcined</b> magnesia. Although some decomposition of the carbonate to oxide occurs at temperatures below 700 °C, the resulting materials appears to reabsorpb carbon dioxide from the air.|$|R
50|$|One way is by sea or lakewater {{magnesium}} chloride hydrolyzed to hydroxide, {{which is then}} <b>calcined</b> to <b>magnesium</b> oxide by removal of water. Another way is using mined magnesite (MgCO3) that has been <b>calcined</b> to <b>magnesium</b> oxide by carbon dioxide removal.By far the most used raw material is mined dolomite, a mixed (Ca,Mg)CO3, where the calcium oxide present in the reaction zone scavenges the silica formed, releasing heat and consuming one of the products, thus helping push the equilibrium to the right.|$|R
40|$|Homogeneous (unseeded) {{precipitation}} {{of magnesium}} carbonate hydrates by the reaction Of MgCl 2 with Na 2 CO 3 in supersaturated solutions between 273 and 363 K was investigated. The compositions, morphologies and filtration {{characteristics of the}} precipitates were studied in detail. The magnesium carbonate hydrates obtained at 313 K and {{in the range of}} 343 - 363 K showed good morphologies and filtration characteristics.

40|$|The {{precipitation}} {{parameters of}} mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) using <b>caustic</b> <b>calcined</b> magnesia were evaluated at simulated industrial conditions using a mixed sulphate–chloride feed solution and fine magnesia powder. Controlling {{the rate of}} magnesia addition was found to decrease the manganese content of the precipitate but the benefit was minimal. Thermodynamic analysis combined with oxidation–reduction potential measurements suggests {{that some of the}} manganese is reporting to the solids by an oxidative precipitation reaction. The oxidative precipitation of manganese in air was confirmed experimentally. Contacting MHP with feed solution was found to substantially improve the solids 2 ̆ 7 nickel and cobalt grade while decreasing the manganese and magnesium content. Precipitate contacting with the feed solution also resulted in a higher concentration of sulphate and chloride in the precipitate...|$|R

It was isolated again by Peter Woulfe in 1767, by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1770 and by Joseph Priestley in 1773 and was termed by him [...] "alkaline air".

40|$|Magnesium {{modification}} {{at different}} calcination temperatures of γ-alumina supports for cobalt Fischer-Tropsch catalysts was investigated. Support modification and catalyst preparation were performed {{by applying the}} incipient wetness impregnation method and resulted in supports containing 7, 5 wt. % Mg and catalysts containing 12 wt. % Co and 0, 5 wt. % Re. Selected support samples have in addition been promoted with 2 wt. % Al post magnesium modification, while others have been treated hydrothermally with water at 300 °C and 30 bar. The modified supports and the corresponding catalysts have been characterized by N 2 adsorption, H 2 chemisorption, X-ray diffraction and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis analysis in a dual isotherm fixed-bed unit at 20 bar, 210 ± 0, 5 °C and H 2 /CO = 2, 1. It was established that high temperature calcination of magnesium modified γ-alumina leads to a support material consisting of crystalline α-alumina and MgAl 2 O 4 spinel. α-alumina formation was intensified {{by the addition of}} extra aluminium post magnesium impregnation. For the low temperature <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesium</b> modified γ-alumina supports only γ-alumina was detected, and for the medium temperature calcined supports only MgAl 2 O 4 spinel was detected. Hydrothermal treatment with water appeared to induce boehmite formation in the magnesium modified support material. High temperature calcination led to low surface areas, small pore volumes and large pore diameters and magnesium modification does not have the ability to counteract this effect. High to medium temperature calcination resulted in larger surface areas, indicating that the collapse of pore structure to a certain degree is counteracted by introducing a 2 -valent metal in the support material. A small decrease in surface area was observed upon addition of extra aluminium due to the initiating effect of extra aluminium addition to form α-alumina. Both the low temperature and the high temperature <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesium</b> modified alumina supported cobalt/rhenium catalyst were essentially inactive for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The medium temperature calcined samples displayed relatively low activity as well. Increased C 5 + selectivity was observed accompanying an increase in CO conversion and an increase in C 5 + selectivity was observed upon magnesium modification of the γ-alumina support compared to the standard when MgAl 2 O 4 spinel and/or α-alumina were present. The effect of increased surface acidity was an increase in C 5 + selectivity at the expense of C 4. It appears that magnesium moderation does not cause any changes in methane selectivity...|$|R
40|$|Magnesium oxide {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} magnesium compounds used in industry. The production of MgO is often done from <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesium</b> carbonate or from natural magnesium saline solutions (sea water and brines). In the case of these solutions, magnesium oxide is precipitated after the addition of a strong base (eg. Ammonia). <b>Magnesium</b> hydroxide is <b>calcined</b> after its separation from the excess resulting from the strong base through filtration. Thus, magnesia qualities may differ depending on several physical parameters and particularly on the nature of the compound. Consequently, two different compounds were selected: magnesium chloride and magnesium sulphate which can be recovered from Tunisian natural brines. Three physical factors were considered: calcination temperatures, precipitation temperatures and calcination time of Mg(OH) 2. The decomposition of Mg(OH) 2 was investigated by DTA/TGA. Mass losses vary in the range (23. 0 %- 29. 9 %). Starting decomposition temperatures are between 362 °C and 385 °C. The MgO produced from MgSO 4 under 1000 °C within 48 hours of calcination time and with 40 °C as a reaction temperature for Mg(OH) 2 shows a good crystallinity and is of a cristallyte size of 86. 3 nm and has a specific surface area equal to 16. 87 m 2 g- 1. Finally, morphological differences between MgO agglomerates at different temperatures were observed by SEM. Consequently, magnesium sulphate as precursor for preparing MgO is selected...|$|R

A {{stoichiometric}} MgAl 2 O 4 spinel (MAS) powder was synthesized by calcining a compacted {{mixture of}} α-Al 2 O 3 and <b>calcined</b> <b>caustic</b> MgO at 1400 ◦C for 1 h and was surface treated against hydrolysis using an ethanol solution of H 3 PO 4 and Al(H 2 PO 4) 3 after fine grinding. Aqueous suspensions with 41 – 45 vol. % treated powder were prepared using tetra methyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and an ammonium salt of polyacrylic acid (Duramax D- 3005) as dispersing agents. These stable suspensions were consolidated in plaster moulds by slip casting (SC) route {{for the first}} time. For comparison purposes, the treated powder was also compacted by die-pressing technique after converting into freeze-dried granules and sintered along with slip cast samples at 1550 – 1650 ◦C for 1 – 2 h. The MAS ceramics fabricated by slip casting and die-pressing exhibited comparable properties...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{high-level}} waste pretreatment and immobilized low activity waste processing, liquid secondary wastes will be generated {{that will be}} transferred to the Effluent Treatment Facility on the Hanford Site for further treatment. These liquid secondary wastes will be converted to stable solid waste forms that will be disposed in the Integrated Disposal Facility. Currently, four waste forms are being considered for stabilization and solidification of the liquid secondary wastes. These waste forms are Cast Stone, Ceramicrete, DuraLith, and Fluidized Bed Steam Reformer. The preferred alternative will be down selected from these four waste forms. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is developing data packages to support the down selection process. The objective of the data packages is to identify, evaluate, and summarize the existing information on the four waste forms being considered for stabilization and solidification of the liquid secondary wastes. The information included will be based on information available in the open literature and from data obtained from testing currently underway. This data package is for the Ceramicrete waste form. Ceramicrete is a relatively new engineering material developed at Argonne National Laboratory to treat radioactive and hazardous waste streams (e. g., Wagh 2004; Wagh et al. 1999 a, 2003; Singh et al. 2000). This cement-like waste form can be used to treat solids, liquids, and sludges by chemical immobilization, microencapsulation, and/or macroencapsulation. The Ceramicrete technology is based on chemical reaction between phosphate anions and metal cations to form a strong, dense, durable, low porosity matrix that immobilizes hazardous and radioactive contaminants as insoluble phosphates and microencapsulates insoluble radioactive components and other constituents that do not form phosphates. Ceramicrete is a type of phosphate-bonded ceramic, which are also known as chemically bonded phosphate ceramics. The Ceramicrete binder is formed through an acid-base reaction between <b>calcined</b> <b>magnesium</b> oxide (MgO; a base) and potassium hydrogen phosphate (KH{sub 2 }PO{sub 4 }; an acid) in aqueous solution. The reaction product sets at room temperature to form a highly crystalline material. During the reaction, the hazardous and radioactive contaminants also react with KH{sub 2 }PO{sub 4 } to form highly insoluble phosphates. In this data package, physical property and waste acceptance data for Ceramicrete waste forms fabricated with wastes having compositions that were similar to those expected for secondary waste effluents, as well as secondary waste effluent simulants from the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant were reviewed. With the exception of one secondary waste form formulation (25 FA+ 25 W+ 1 B. A. fabricated with the mixed simulant did not meet the compressive strength requirement), all the Ceramicrete waste forms that were reviewed met or exceeded Integrated Disposal Facility waste acceptance criteria...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} three cold-setting {{refractory}} concretes using the chemical magnesia-phosphate bond were prepared. A mixture of <b>calcined</b> alumina, microsilica, <b>magnesium</b> oxide and phosphoric acid {{was designed to}} form cordierite during the heating. This cementitious paste acts like a matrix in which the aggregates are embedded. Three different aggregates were used: cordierite-mullite (C), mullite chamotte (M) and tabular alumina (T) with the objective to analyze its behaviour and the matrix-aggregate interaction. These concretes set at room temperature, being observed by XRD, {{in addition to the}} typical reflections of each aggregate, the presence of MgHPO 4 á 3 H 2 O (newberyite) in low proportion and predominantly amorphous phase. At 110 ¡C were not detected crystalline hydrated phosphates. At 1100 ¡C was formed aluminium orthophosphate, AlPO 4 cristobalite type. At 1350 ¡C the matrix was transformed into cordierite-mullite, being also detected small amounts of Mg 3 (PO 4) 2. Although the phases developed in the matrix during heating were similar for three concretes, performance at elevated temperatures was different. The possible causes of unsatisfactory behaviour of concretes made with aggregates of mullite chamotte and tabular alumina were analyzed. The main properties of concrete made with cordierite-mullite aggregates were presented...|$|R
