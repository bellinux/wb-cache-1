5|$|In plants, {{nitrogen}} {{is first}} assimilated into organic compounds {{in the form}} of glutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses transaminases to move the amino group to another alpha-keto <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid.</b> For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too.|$|E
5|$|As {{amino acids}} have both a primary amine group and a primary {{carboxyl}} group, these chemicals can undergo {{most of the}} reactions associated with these functional groups. These include nucleophilic addition, amide bond formation, and imine formation for the amine group, and esterification, amide bond formation, and decarboxylation for the <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> group. The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.|$|E
5|$|Other {{metabolites}} {{isolated from}} different species include dibenzonaphtyridinone alkaloids, prenylated phenols, benzofurans, chromenes, natural rubber (polyisoprene), sterols, and the sugar alcohol volemitol. Among toxic substances, Lactarius turpis contains the mutagenic alkaloid necatorin, {{and the small}} compound cycloprop-2-ene <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> {{has been identified as}} the toxic agent in Russula subnigricans. Some secondary metabolites showed antibiotic properties in laboratory tests. An ethanolic extract of Russula delica was antibacterial, and a lectin from Russula rosea showed antitumor activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydroxyl}} group on <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> may {{be replaced with}} a chlorine atom using thionyl chloride to give acyl chlorides. In nature, <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> are converted to thioesters.|$|R
30|$|Based {{on these}} results, various substrates, {{including}} sugars, alcohols, <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids,</b> and amino acids, {{were added to}} the cells at 0  h in the flat-plate culture at a concentration of 200  mM (Fig.  4 b). Due to the low solubility of leucine, aspartate, and glutamate, these amino acids were added at a concentration of 100  mM. Stock solutions of fumaric acid, succinic acid, and pantothenate were adjusted to pH 5.2, pH 4.5, and pH 5.0, respectively, and solutions of the other <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> and amino acids were adjusted to pH 2.5. Monosaccharides, disaccharides, sugar alcohols, <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> (maleic acid, 2 -oxoglutaric acid, citric acid, and pantothenate), and amino acids increased the respiratory rate 3 - to 6 -fold, whereas ethanol, ethylene glycol, and acetamide increased the respiratory rate 2 -fold. Glycerol and four-carbon-atom <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> (fumaric acid, malic acid, and succinic acid) increased the respiratory rate 7 - to 11 -fold. <b>Carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> with a carbon number less than three proved toxic to C. merolae cells, which immediately turned yellow and died when the concentration of <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> was 200  mM.|$|R
50|$|Normal <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> are {{the direct}} union of a {{carbonyl}} group and a hydroxyl group. In vinylogous <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids,</b> a {{carbon-carbon double bond}} separates the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups.|$|R
5|$|Amino acids {{must first}} pass out of organelles and cells into blood {{circulation}} via amino acid transporters, since the amine and <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> groups are typically ionized. Degradation of an amino acid, {{occurring in the}} liver and kidneys, often involves deamination by moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. This process involves transaminases, often {{the same as those}} used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the urea cycle and is excreted in the form of urea. However, amino acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead. For example, serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia. After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} amine and <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> groups of amino acids can {{react to form}} amide bonds, one amino acid {{molecule}} can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist to}} {{synthesize}} amino acids. One {{of the oldest}} methods begins with the bromination at the α-carbon of a <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid.</b> Nucleophilic substitution with ammonia then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid. In alternative fashion, the Strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with potassium cyanide and ammonia, this produces an α-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α-amino acid. Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids. Likewise, using ketones, instead of aldehydes, gives α,α-disubstituted amino acids. The classical synthesis gives racemic mixtures of α-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries or asymmetric catalysts have been developed.|$|E
25|$|Salts and esters of <b>{{carboxyl}}ic</b> <b>acids</b> {{are called}} carboxylates. When a carboxyl group is deprotonated, its conjugate base forms a carboxylate anion. Carboxylate ions are resonance-stabilized, and this increased stability makes <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> more acidic than alcohols. <b>Carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> {{can be seen}} as reduced or alkylated forms of the Lewis acid carbon dioxide; under some circumstances they can be decarboxylated to yield carbon dioxide.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> are polar. Because {{they are}} both hydrogen-bond acceptors (the {{carbonyl}} –C=O) and hydrogen-bond donors (the hydroxyl –OH), they also participate in hydrogen bonding. Together the hydroxyl and carbonyl group forms the functional group carboxyl. <b>Carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> usually exist as dimeric pairs in nonpolar media due to their tendency to [...] "self-associate." [...] Smaller <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> (1 to 5 carbons) are soluble in water, whereas higher <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> are less soluble due to the increasing hydrophobic nature of the alkyl chain. These longer chain acids tend to be rather soluble in less-polar solvents such as ethers and alcohols.|$|R
50|$|In organic chemistry, {{hydrolysis}} reactions often give two fragments from {{an initial}} substrate. For example, the hydrolysis of amides give <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> and amines; the hydrolysis of esters give alcohols and <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acids.</b>|$|R
5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. The form II is only stable at 100K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids, or {{fatty acid}} {{residues}} {{when they are}} part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains a double bond, there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon linolenic acid, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes, render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.|$|E
25|$|Acyl {{chlorides}} {{can be used}} {{to prepare}} <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives, including acid anhydrides, esters, and amides by reacting acid chlorides with: a salt of a <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid,</b> an alcohol, or an amine respectively. The use of a base, e.g. aqueous sodium hydroxide or pyridine, or excess amine (when preparing amides) is desirable to remove the hydrogen chloride byproduct, and to catalyze the reaction. While it is often possible to obtain esters or amides from the <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> with alcohols or amines, the reactions are reversible, often leading to low yields. In contrast, both reactions involved in preparing esters and amides via acyl chlorides (acyl chloride formation from <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid,</b> followed by coupling with the alcohol or amine) are fast and irreversible. This makes the two-step route often preferable to the single step reaction with the <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
