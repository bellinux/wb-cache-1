40|$|Behaviours {{are judged}} by their causes (i. e. the actor's intentions) {{as well as}} by their <b>consequences.</b> The present study focuses on the effects of the latter. Subjects judged {{behaviours}} that were either socially good, socially bad, competent, or incompetent. The <b>consequences</b> of the behaviours were either (a) personal <b>consequences</b> for the actor, (b) interpersonal <b>consequences</b> for others, or (c) not mentioned. Behaviours with interpersonal <b>consequences</b> were judged more extremely than with personal <b>consequences.</b> When no <b>consequences</b> were mentioned, the behaviours were rated similarly as in the condition with interpersonal <b>consequences.</b> These effects emerged regardless of behaviour valence (positive versus negative) and dimension (social versus competence-related). The results suggest that others' behaviours are judged primarily by their interpersonal implications, and that observers take the perspective of those whose outcomes may be affected by the actor...|$|R
40|$|History {{is replete}} with well-intentioned actions and {{policies}} that have resulted in dramatic unin-tended <b>consequences.</b> We review evidence that several psychological biases result in an overly nar-row focus on the intended <b>consequences</b> of acts and, consequently, tendencies to ignore or give too little weight to potential unintended <b>consequences.</b> First, a motivated desire for the intended <b>consequences</b> of acts can blind people to the likelihood of alternative possibilities. We review evi-dence that people process information and evidence in biased ways, leaving them overconfident that the desired <b>consequences</b> will come to pass. Second, {{even in the absence}} of motives regarding potential <b>consequences,</b> biases in cognition lead people to focus their attention narrowly on intended <b>consequences</b> in a way that limits their consideration of important alternative, unin-tended <b>consequences.</b> We review how biases toward focalism and anchoring contribute to a failure to foresee unintended <b>consequences.</b> Finally, we review evidence that subtle manipulations of both motivation and attention can be used to increase the focus and weight given to potential unintended <b>consequences</b> and, consequently, improve anticipation. Throughout history, well-intentioned actions have often led to unintended and unfore...|$|R

One hundred eighteen college students completed self-report measures assessing drinking motives and social anxiety and an interview assessing alcohol consumption and <b>consequences.</b> Highly socially anxious women were particularly apt to experience adverse role functioning <b>consequences,</b> while men were particularly apt to experience physical <b>consequences.</b> Although highly socially anxious women reported more personal <b>consequences</b> than did women {{with low to}} moderate social anxiety, men with low to moderate social anxiety reported experiencing more social and personal <b>consequences</b> than did women with low to moderate social anxiety.

5|$|In these {{compliance}} models {{the possibility}} of entities breaking a law has both a likelihood of occurrence and a <b>consequence</b> of occurrence, known as a 'risk event'.

5|$|It is {{important}} to note that the boundaries between category are able to be moved to allocate more or fewer clients to each category.

40|$|Objectives: To study time {{estimates}} by women smokers for when smoking-related <b>consequences</b> will occur given continuing or quitting smoking. The relationship of these estimates to pregnancy and intent {{to quit smoking}} was also investigated. Methods: Over a two-week period, eighty women, selected to constitute four subgroups formed by pregnant vs. non-pregnant and trying vs. not trying to quit smoking, rated times at which they would expect smoking-related <b>consequences</b> to occur given continuing or quitting smoking. Results: Somatic health <b>consequences</b> were estimated to occur later than <b>consequences</b> related to mood and social relations. All <b>consequences</b> were estimated to occur later given quitting smoking. Pregnancy {{had an effect on}} the estimated time that <b>consequences</b> would occur, with pregnant women estimating earlier occurrence of <b>consequences</b> related to mood and social relations than non-pregnant women did. Conclusion: Health messages should stress <b>consequences</b> for somatic health in quitting smoking, since outcomes later in time might have too low a value to exert a positive effect on decisions to quit smoking...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a modelling approach for representing <b>consequences</b> of automation degradation {{in the context}} of a socio-technical network. This modelling approach involves two different notations. In previous work we have proposed a synergistic approach integrating these two views for describing the evolution of system performances under automation degradation. In the current paper we propose a more global approach encompassing the previous contribution and being specifically addressing the representation of <b>consequences</b> flowing from the occurrence of automation degradation. In this approach, four modelling levels of <b>consequences</b> are studied: direct <b>consequences</b> of automation propagation, <b>consequences</b> on the capacity to respond, <b>consequences</b> on resilience capacity and <b>consequences</b> on network performance. This stepwise refinement aims at acquiring and modelling additional information needed for being able to assess the <b>consequences</b> of automation degradation. The approach is exemplified on a case study in the domain of Air Traffic Management and more precisely Terminal Manoeuvre Area including an Arrival Manager (AMAN). Due to space constraints only the first level is fully presented...|$|R
