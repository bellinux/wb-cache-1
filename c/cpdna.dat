40|$|As {{the largest}} and the basal-most family of conifers, Pinaceae {{provides}} key insights into the evolutionary history of conifers. We present comparative chloroplast genomics and analysis of concatenated 49 chloroplast protein-coding genes common to 19 gymnosperms, including 15 species from 8 Pinaceous genera, to address the long-standing controversy about Pinaceae phylogeny. The complete <b>cpDNAs</b> of Cathaya argyrophylla and Cedrus deodara (Abitoideae) and draft <b>cpDNAs</b> of Larix decidua, Picea morrisonicola, and Pseudotsuga wilsoniana are reported. We found 21 - and 42 -kb inversions in congeneric species and different populations of Pinaceous species, which indicates that structural polymorphics may be common and ancient in Pinaceae. Our phylogenetic analyses reveal that Cedrus is clustered with Abies–Keteleeria rather than the basal-most genus of Pinaceae and that Cathaya is closer to Pinus than to Picea or Larix–Pseudotsuga. Topology and structural change tests and indel-distribution comparisons lend further evidence to our phylogenetic finding. Our molecular datings suggest that Pinaceae first evolved during Early Jurassic, and diversification of Pinaceous subfamilies and genera took place during Mid-Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous, respectively. Using different maximum-likelihood divergences as thresholds, we conclude that 2 (Abietoideae and Larix–Pseudotsuga–Piceae–Cathaya–Pinus), 4 (Cedrus, non-Cedrus Abietoideae, Larix–Pseudotsuga, and Piceae–Cathaya–Pinus), or 5 (Cedrus, non-Cedrus Abietoideae, Larix–Pseudotsuga, Picea, and Cathaya–Pinus) groups/subfamilies are more reasonable delimitations for Pinaceae.

40|$|In the Chlorophyceae, the {{chloroplast}} genome {{is extraordinarily}} fluid in architecture and displays unique features {{relative to other}} groups of green algae. For the Chaetophorales, 1 of the 5 major lineages of the Chlorophyceae, {{it has been shown}} that the distinctive architecture of the 223, 902 -bp genome of Stigeoclonium helveticum is consistent with bidirectional DNA replication from a single origin. Here, we report the 182, 759 -bp chloroplast genome sequence of Schizomeris leibleinii, a member of the earliest diverging lineage of the Chaetophorales. Like its Stigeoclonium homolog, the Schizomeris genome lacks a large inverted repeat encoding the rRNA operon and displays a striking bias in coding regions that is associated with a bias in base composition along each strand. Our results support the notion that these two chaetophoralean genomes replicate bidirectionally from a putative origin located in the vicinity of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Their shared structural characteristics were most probably inherited from the common ancestor of all chaetophoralean algae. Short dispersed repeats account for most of the 41 -kb size variation between the Schizomeris and Stigeoclonium genomes, and there is no indication that homologous recombination between these repeated elements led to the observed gene rearrangements. A comparison of the extent of variation sustained by the Stigeoclonium and Schizomeris chloroplast DNAs (<b>cpDNAs)</b> with that observed for the <b>cpDNAs</b> of the chlamydomonadalean Chlamydomonas and Volvox suggests that gene rearrangements as well as changes in the abundance of intergenic and intron sequences occurred at a slower pace in the Chaetophorales than in the Chlamydomonadales...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} among the extant five gymnosperm groups—gnetophytes, Pinaceae, non-Pinaceae conifers (cupressophytes), Ginkgo, and cycads—remain equivocal. To clarify this issue, we sequenced the chloroplast genomes (<b>cpDNAs)</b> from two cupressophytes, Cephalotaxus wilsoniana and Taiwania cryptomerioides, and 53 common chloroplast protein-coding genes from another three cupressophytes, Agathis dammara, Nageia nagi, and Sciadopitys verticillata, and a non-Cycadaceae cycad, Bowenia serrulata. Comparative analyses of 11 conifer <b>cpDNAs</b> revealed that Pinaceae and cupressophytes each lost a different copy of inverted repeats (IRs), which contrasts with {{the view that the}} same IR has been lost in all conifers. Based on our structural finding, the character of an IR loss no longer conflicts with the “gnepines” hypothesis (gnetophytes sister to Pinaceae). Chloroplast phylogenomic analyses of amino acid sequences recovered incongruent topologies using different tree-building methods; however, we demonstrated that high heterotachous genes (genes that have highly different rates in different lineages) contributed to the long-branch attraction (LBA) artifact, resulting in incongruence of phylogenomic estimates. Additionally, amino acid compositions appear more heterogeneous in high than low heterotachous genes among the five gymnosperm groups. Removal of high heterotachous genes alleviated the LBA artifact and yielded congruent and robust tree topologies in which gnetophytes and Pinaceae formed a sister clade to cupressophytes (the gnepines hypothesis) and Ginkgo clustered with cycads. Adding more cupressophyte taxa could not improve the accuracy of chloroplast phylogenomics for the five gymnosperm groups. In contrast, removal of high heterotachous genes from data sets is simple and can increase confidence in evaluating the phylogeny of gymnosperms...|$|R

500|$|Although myrmecochory {{is by far}} {{the most}} common {{dispersal}} method, white-tailed deer have also been shown to disperse the seeds on rare occasions by ingestion and defecation. While ants only move seeds up to about 10 meters, deer have been observed to transport the seeds over 1 kilometer. This helps to explain post-agricultural colonization of forest sites by Trillium grandiflorum, as well as long distance gene flow which has been detected in other studies. Furthermore, it helps resolve what has been called [...] "Reid's paradox", which states that migration during glaciation events must have been impossible for plants with dispersal rates under several hundred meters per year, such as Trillium grandiflorum. Thus occasional long distance dispersal events, such as by deer, probably helped save this and other species with otherwise short distance dispersal ability from extinction during the glaciations of the ice ages. Furthermore, nested clade analysis of <b>cpDNA</b> haplotypes has shown that Trillium grandiflorum is likely to have persisted through the last glacial period in two sites of refuge in the southeastern United States and that long distance dispersal was responsible for the post-glacial recolonization of northern areas.|$|E

The duplication element is shown to have the usual properties of a plant mtDNA high frequency “recombination repeat”. The culture mtDNA exists as a complex heterogeneous population of rearranged and unrearranged molecules. Some of the culture-associated rearranged molecules are present in low levels in native plant tissue and appear to have sorted out and amplified in the culture. Other mtDNA rearrangements may have occurred de novo. In addition to alterations of the main mitochondrial genome, an 11. 3 kb linear mtDNA plasmid present in whole plants is absent from the culture.

A number of authors tried {{to address the issue}} using {{individual}} gene markers or genetic fingerprinting techniques; however, these studies did not converge on any particular outcome. Wising to test the performance of the phylogenomic approach in resolving infrageneric relationships within Malus, we built a 134, 553 position long alignment including two previously published <b>cpDNAs</b> and 45 de novo sequenced, fully colinear chloroplast genomes from cultivated apple varieties and wild apple species.

One apple cultivar was embedded in a monophylum comprising wild M. sieversii accessions and other Asian apple species.

40|$|We have {{constructed}} the first physical map of a gymnosperm chloroplast genome and compared its organization {{with those of}} a fern and several angiosperms by heterologous filter hybridization. The chloroplast genome of the gymnosperm Ginkgo biloba consists of a 158 kb circular chromosome that contains a ribosomal RNA-encoding inverted repeat approximately 17 kb in size. Gene mapping experiments demonstrate a remarkable similarity in the linear order and absolute positions of the ribosomal RNA genes and of 17 protein genes in the <b>cpDNAs</b> of Ginkgo biloba, the fern Osmunda cinnamomea and the angiosperm Spinacia oleracea. Moreover, filter hybridizations using as probes cloned fragments that cover {{the entirety of the}} angiosperm chloroplast genome reveal a virtually colinear arrangement of homologous sequence elements in these genomes representing three divisions of vascular plants that diverged some 200 – 400 million years ago. The only major difference in chloroplast genome structure among these vascular plants involves the size of the rRNA-encoding inverted repeat, which is only 10 kb in Osmunda, 17 kb in Ginkgo, and about 25 kb in most angiosperms.

Y. Wang and C. Y. Deng, a threatened cycad species endemic to Southwest China. High levels of genetic diversity and genetic differentiation were revealed in C. segmentifida. Haplotypes of networks showed two evolutionary units in C. segmentifida, {{with the exception of}} the nuclear gene GTP network. Meanwhile, the UPGMA tree, structure and PCoA analyses suggested that 14 populations of C. segmentifida were divided into two clades. There was significant effect of isolation by distance (IBD) in this species. However, this species did not display a significant phylogeographic structure. The divergence time estimation suggested that its haplotypes diverged during the Middle Pleistocene. Additionally, the population dynamics inferred from different DNA sequences analyses were discordant. Bottleneck analysis showed that populations of C. segmentifida did not experience any recent bottleneck effect, but rather pointed to a contraction of its effective population size over time. Furthermore, our results suggested that the population BM which held an intact population structure and occupied undisturbed habitat was at the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, implying that this population is a free-mating system.

40|$|Abstract Background Fabaceae (legumes) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{families}} of flowering plants, and some members are important crops. In contrast to what we know about their great diversity or economic importance, our knowledge at the genomic level of chloroplast genomes (<b>cpDNAs</b> or plastomes) for these crops is limited. Results We sequenced the complete genome of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgari s cv. Negro Jamapa) chloroplast. The plastome of P. vulgaris is a 150, 285 bp circular molecule. It has gene content similar to that of other legume plastomes, but contains two pseudogenes, rpl 33 and rps 16. A distinct inversion occurred at the junction points of trn H-GUG/ rpl 14 and rps 19 / rps 8, as in adzuki bean 1. These two pseudogenes and the inversion were confirmed in 10 varieties representing the two domestication centers of the bean. Genomic comparative analysis indicated that inversions generally occur in legume plastomes and the magnitude and localization of insertions/deletions (indels) also vary. The analysis of repeat sequences demonstrated that patterns and sequences of tandem repeats had an important impact on sequence diversification between legume plastomes and tandem repeats did not belong to dispersed repeats. Interestingly, P. vulgaris plastome had higher evolutionary rates of change on both genomic and gene levels than G. max, which could be the consequence of pressure from both mutation and natural selection. Conclusion Legume chloroplast genomes are widely diversified in gene content, gene order, indel structure, abundance and localization of repetitive sequences, intracellular sequence exchange and evolutionary rates. The P. vulgaris plastome is a rapidly evolving genome. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Eukaryotic chloroplasts, {{as well as}} {{the other}} plant plastids, also contain {{extrachromosomal}} DNA molecules. Most chloroplasts house all of their genetic material in a single ringed chromosome, however in some species there is evidence of multiple smaller ringed plasmids. A recent theory that questions the current standard model of ring shaped chloroplast DNA (<b>cpDNA),</b> suggests that <b>cpDNA</b> may more commonly take a linear shape. A single molecule of <b>cpDNA</b> can contain anywhere from 100-200 genes [...] and varies in size from species to species. The size of <b>cpDNA</b> in higher plants is around 120-160 kb.

40|$|The {{evolution}} and recombination of chloroplast genome {{structure in the}} fern genus Osmunda were studied by comparative restriction site mapping and filter hybridization of chloroplast DNAs (<b>cpDNAs)</b> from three species — 0. cinnamomea, 0. claytoniana and 0. regalis. The three 144 kb circular genomes {{were found to be}} colinear in organization, indicating that no major inversions or transpositions had occurred during the approximately 70 million years since their radiation from a common ancestor. Although overall size and sequence arrangement are highly conserved in the three genomes, they differ by an extensive series of small deletions and insertions, ranging in size from 50 bp to 350 by and scattered more or less at random throughout the circular chromosomes. All three chloroplast genomes contain a large inverted repeat of approximately 10 kb in size. However, hybridizations using cloned fragments from the 0. cinnamomea and 0. regalis genomes revealed the absence of any dispersed repeats in at least 50 % of the genome. Analysis with restriction enzymes that fail to cleave the 10 kb inverted repeat indicated that each of the three fern chloroplast genomes exists as an equimolar population of two isomeric circles differing only in the relative orientation of their two single copy regions. These two inversion isomers are inferred to result from high frequency intramolecular recombination between paired inverted repeat segments. In all aspects of their general organization, recombinational heterogeneity, and extent of structural rearrangement and length mutation, these fern chloroplast genomes resemble very closely the chloroplast genomes of most angiosperms...|$|R
40|$|Chloroplast genome structure, gene {{order and}} content are highly conserved in land plants. We sequenced the {{complete}} chloroplast genome sequence of Trachelium caeruleum (Campanulaceae) {{a member of}} an angiosperm family known for highly rearranged chloroplast genomes. The total genome size is 162, 321 bp with an IR of 27, 273 bp, LSC of 100, 113 bp and SSC of 7, 661 bp. The genome encodes 115 unique genes, with 19 duplicated in the IR, a tRNA (trnI-CAU) duplicated once in the LSC and a protein coding gene (psbJ) duplicated twice, for a total of 137 genes. Four genes (ycf 15, rpl 23, infA and accD) are truncated and likely nonfunctional; three others (clpP, ycf 1 and ycf 2) are so highly diverged that they may now be pseudogenes. The most conspicuous feature of the Trachelium genome is the presence of eighteen internally unrearranged blocks of genes that have been inverted or relocated within the genome, relative to the typical gene order of most angiosperm chloroplast genomes. Recombination between repeats or tRNAs has been suggested as two means of chloroplast genome rearrangements. We compared the relative number of repeats in Trachelium to eight other angiosperm chloroplast genomes, and evaluated the location of repeats and tRNAs in relation to rearrangements. Trachelium has the highest number and largest repeats, which are concentrated near inversion endpoints or other rearrangements. tRNAs occur at many but not all inversion endpoints. There is likely no single mechanism responsible for the remarkable number of alterations in this genome, but both repeats and tRNAs are clearly associated with these rearrangements. Land plant chloroplast genomes are highly conserved in structure, gene order and content. The chloroplast genomes of ferns, the gymnosperm Ginkgo, and most angiosperms are nearly collinear, reflecting the gene order in lineages that diverged from lycopsids and the ancestral chloroplast gene order over 350 million years ago (Raubeson and Jansen, 1992). Although earlier mapping studies identified a number of taxa in which several rearrangements have occurred (reviewed in Raubeson and Jansen, 2005), an extraordinary number of chloroplast genome alterations are concentrated in several families in the angiosperm order Asterales (sensu APGII, Bremer et al., 2003). Gene mapping studies of representatives of the Campanulaceae (Cosner, 1993; Cosner et al., 1997, 2004) and Lobeliaceae (Knox et al., 1993; Knox and Palmer, 1999) identified large inversions, contraction and expansion of the inverted repeat regions, and several insertions and deletions in the <b>cpDNAs</b> of these closely related taxa. Detailed restriction site and gene mapping of the chloroplast genome of Trachelium caeruleum (Campanulaceae) identified seven to ten large inversions, families of repeats associated with rearrangements, possible transpositions, and even the disruption of operons (Cosner et al., 1997). Seventeen other members of the Campanulaceae were mapped and exhibit many additional rearrangements (Cosner et al., 2004). What happened in this lineage that made it susceptible to so many chloroplast genome rearrangements? How do normally very conserved chloroplast genomes change? The cause of rearrangements in this group is unclear based on the limited resolution available with mapping techniques. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how rearrangements occur: recombination between repeats, transposition, or temporary instability due to loss of the inverted repeat (Raubeson and Jansen, 2005). Sequencing whole chloroplast genomes within the Campanulaceae offers a unique opportunity to examine both the extent and mechanisms of rearrangements within a phylogenetic framework. We report here the first complete chloroplast genome sequence of a member of the Campanulaceae, Trachelium caeruleum. This work will serve as a benchmark for subsequent, comparative sequencing and analysis of other members of this family and close relatives, with the goal of further understanding chloroplast genome evolution. We confirmed features previously identified through mapping, and discovered many additional structural changes, including several partial to entire gene duplications, deterioration of at least four normally conserved chloroplast genes into gene fragments, and the nature and position of numerous repeat elements at or near inversion endpoints. The focus of this paper is on analyses of sequences at or near these rearrangements in Trachelium caeruleum. Inversions are believed to occur due to the presence of repeat elements subject to homologous recombination (Palmer, 1991; Knox et al., 1993). Repeats may facilitate inversions or other genome rearrangements (Achaz et al., 2003), and higher incidences of repeats have been correlated with greater numbers of rearrangements (Rocha, 2003). Alternatively, repeats may proliferate within a genome as a result of DNA strand repair mechanisms following a rearrangement event such as an inversion. Gene mapping studies previously identified five families of dispersed repeats in Trachelium at or near inversion endpoints (Cosner et al., 1997). Here we examine the sequences of these repeats and identify, map and characterize numerous additional repeats within the genome. We compare the number and size of repeats in typical unrearranged angiosperm chloroplast genomes to what we find in the highly rearranged chloroplast genome of Trachelium. The Trachelium chloroplast genome has the highest number and the largest repeats of diverse origin of any sequenced angiosperm chloroplast genome. These repeats are generally clustered at or near rearrangements and they are of diverse origins: partial or entire chloroplast gene duplications, noncoding chloroplast sequences or novel DNA with no clear sequence identity to any existing chloroplast DNA sequences. The Trachelium chloroplast genome represents the most highly rearranged sequenced genome of land plants and its bizarre organization is clearly associated with the high incidence of dispersed repetitive DNA...|$|R

It further contends that {{only a minority of}} the genetic material is kept in circular chromosomes while the rest is in branched, linear, or other complex structures.|$|E

When replication forks form, the strand not being copied is single stranded, and thus at risk for A → G deamination.

Quinquefoliae when midpoint rooting is employed." ...|$|E
