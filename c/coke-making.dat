5000|$|Those {{starting}} materials typically contain hydrogen, nitrogen, or oxygen atoms combined with carbon into molecules of medium to high molecular weight. The <b>coke-making</b> or [...] "coking" [...] process consists of heating {{the material in}} closed vessels to very high temperatures (up to 2000 C) so that those molecules are broken down into lighter volatile substances, which leave the vessel, and a porous but hard residue that is mostly carbon and inorganic ash. The amount of volatiles varies with the source material, but is typically 25-30% of it by weight.|$|E
5000|$|Volatile {{constituents}} of the coal—including water, coal-gas, and coal-tar—are driven off by baking in an airless furnace or oven (kiln) at temperatures {{as high as}} [...] but usually around [...] This fuses together the fixed carbon and residual ash.

50|$|The “Hearth” {{process of}} <b>coke-making,</b> using lump coal, was akin {{to that of}} charcoal-burning; instead of a heap of {{prepared}} wood, covered with twigs, leaves and earth, there was a heap of coals, covered with coke dust. The hearth process continued {{to be used in}} many areas {{during the first half of}} the 19th century, but two events greatly lessened its importance. These were the invention of the hot blast in iron-smelting and the introduction of the beehive coke oven. The use of a blast of hot air, instead of cold air, in the smelting furnace was first introduced by Neilson in Scotland in 1828.The hearth process of making coke from coal is a very lengthy process.|$|E

5000|$|It {{had been}} {{predicted}} that the mineral traffic over the line would (on its own) ensure dividends of at least 5% {{as soon as the}} line opened, but this proved to have been optimistic. The line cost more to build than anticipated, and the mineral traffic was not as large as predicted. The profitability was also low; through rates were effectively governed by those set by the Maryport and Carlisle Railway. These were deliberately set by the M&C at levels (as low as 0.625 d/mile) which should have deterred the construction of competing lines. Unlike the M&CR, the CP&KR had severe gradients (west-bound a climb of 1 in 70 between Penrith and Blencow, east-bound 1 in 62½ between Threkeld and Troutbeck) and therefore higher running costs; a CK&PR chairman claimed that a locomotive could haul on the M&CR a train three times as heavy as it could haul over the CK&PR. [...] Nor did the CK&PR have the lucrative local colliery traffic of the M&CR. Passenger and goods traffic on the line were, however, sufficient to make the CK&PR profitable; eventually passenger traffic became the main revenue as mineral traffic declined further. Technological improvements in steelmaking reduced the dependence of the British steel industry on Cumbrian haematite. Blast furnaces were established close to the orefield, and processed much of the ore locally. Although, initially, they needed to import coke to do so, later improvements in <b>coke-making</b> allowed them to increasingly use coke made from local coal; considerable volumes of Welsh coke also began to reach West Cumbria by sea. Increased foreign production of iron and steel meant a loss of foreign markets and over-capacity in the British iron and steel industry.|$|E

40|$|The {{requirement}} of all <b>coke-making</b> facilities {{is to achieve}} the highest possible production of high quality coke from a chamber. It {{can be achieved by}} filling the effective capacity of the chamber with the highest possible amount of coal. One of the possibilities of meeting this requirement is to increase the charge density in the coke chamber. In case of a coke battery operating on bulk coal there are many methods to increase the charge density including the use of wetting agents in the charge. This article presents the results of the laboratory experiments aiming at the increase of the charge density using fuel oil as a wetting agent.

40|$|The {{removal of}} thiocyanate, a toxic anion {{originating}} {{in a large}} number of industrial processes, from aqueous solutions was investigated using adsorbents of different natures (activated carbon, zeolite, diatomite, sepiolite, hydrotalcite, steel-making residues). The uptake of thiocyanate anions {{did not seem to be}} directly related to the porous features of the adsorbents, but rather connected to the ion-adsorbent affinity. The highest retention in synthetic solutions was obtained with hydrotalcite, followed by activated carbon, zeolite and the steel-making slags. In real wastewater, the removal efficiency of hydrotalcite relative to industrial wastewater was largely suppressed due to the organic matter present. In contrast, the retention ability of the activated carbon and the slags was less modified in real wastewater due to their open porous networks. These results indicate that steel-making slag could be used as a potential adsorbent for the removal of thiocyanate anions from real wastewater produced in <b>coke-making</b> processes without any additional processing.

40|$|The {{organisation}} {{under discussion}} {{is a part}} of a Steel Company and consists of a group of captive underground coal mines required to produce coking coal, wash it in the coal washeries (benefitiation plants) and send the good quality clean coal to the steel plant for steel-making. The emergence of liberalisation in India has affected Indian industries and compelled them to think of ways to become more competitive. The very existence of this coking coal-mining division is at stake due to the availability of better quality imported coal at a cheaper price. Also, the demand for metallurgical-grade coking coal has reduced due to an improvement in <b>coke-making</b> technology, which does not require very high quality metallurgical-grade coking coal. In order to become competitive, the organisation has adopted the strategy of downsizing by technological upgradation and outsourcing the non-core activities.

40|$|An engineering-economic {{model is}} used within a dynamic setting to {{determine}} the least cost mix of investment and import activities as the U. S. steel industry faces successively tighter controls on coke oven emissions over the next 10 years. In response to Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards proposed for 1995, U. S. steel producers would likely export their toxic pollution by importing 6 million tons of coke per year. About 4 million tons of coke oven capacity is retrofit and about 1 million tons of annual coke consumption is replaced by new iron technologies, such as Corex. The Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) standards proposed for 1998 roughly double the coke oven retirements estimated to occur under MACT. Coke imports also are substantial but are no higher than under MACT because the additional time allows the industry to invest in more coke-saving blast furnaces and in new less toxic <b>coke-making</b> technologies, such as the Jewell process. The LAER standards in conjunction with higher capital costs, however, force coke imports to more than 8 million tons per year and sharply increase imports of semi-finished steel. Such a situation could exacerbate existing disputes on international steel trade. Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1993 Technological change, toxic pollution, residual risk,...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGlobal {{warming and}} air {{pollution}} are of great concerns in China due to the rapid industrialization. Iron and steel industry accounts for the largest industrial source of Greenhouse gases (GHGs) and emits a lot of local air pollutants (NOx, PM 10, PM 2. 5 and SO 2). Multiple energy conservation technologies have been promoted by Chinese government to reduce the energy consumption and carbon emissions. Based on the national China-TIMES model, the Base scenario and two carbon constraint scenarios are formulated, to assess the emission reduction potentials and the co-benefit effects for these promoted technologies in the iron and steel industry. The results are as follows: the emissions of CO 2 and SO 2 will reach the peak in 2015; and the emissions will be 1264 Mt and 2. 79 Mt, and then keep decreasing to 244 Mt and 0. 43 Mt in 2050, other local air pollutants will keep declining during 2010 ∼ 2050. The CO 2 reduction potential is about 45. 7 Mt∼ 91. 6 Mt, in which the <b>coke-making,</b> iron-making and casting processes have the largest contribution to this. The emissions of local air pollutants will be reduced significantly under the two CO 2 emission reduction scenarios. The reduction of CO 2 has the most significant co-benefit effect on reducing SO 2 emissions, but limited co-benefit effect on reducing PM 2. 5...|$|E
40|$|More than 50 % of {{hot metal}} {{production}} worldwide {{takes place in}} blast furnaces. Coke {{is the most expensive}} raw material in the blast furnace. It acts as the burden support as well as heat source and reductant in the blast furnace. As technology advances, supplementary fuels can supply heat and reduce the iron oxides, but coke would always be needed as burden support. Blast furnaces have been using coke for the past century and will continue to use coke for the next few decades. The price of coke is determined by its quality. Strict environmental laws and regulations in the USA pushed <b>coke-making</b> technology since the early 1990 s towards the beehive type of oven. Gas collected during the coke cycle is used to supply heat to the process. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the spatial variation and coke quality in the non-recovery ovens and provide an explanation for it. The original coal was tested and samples of the coke were obtained from the top, bottom and sides of a coke oven. The samples were prepared and submitted for image analysis to determine the porosity, cell wall thickness and pore diameter. The samples were also submitted for a microscopical point counting to determine the micro textures of the coke. The coke was further submitted for the coke strength after reaction testing (CSR). The results show clear variation in the coke and a model of the behavior of the gas inside the coke oven during the carbonization process was developed based on the results of the tests. The model shows the flow of gas from the bottom of the oven up along the sidewalls to escape from the coke charge through the top. The flow of gas enriched the coke on the side of the oven by deposition of pyrolitic carbon to create an ultra-high grade of coke that could physically be separated from the rest of the coke and be sold separately at a higher price.

40|$|China and India are the {{two largest}} {{anthropogenic}} aerosol generating countries in the world. In this study, we develop a new inventory of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and primary carbonaceous aerosol (i. e., black and organic carbon, BC and OC) emissions from these two countries for the period 1996 – 2010, using a technology-based methodology. Emissions from major anthropogenic sources and open biomass burning are included, and time-dependent trends in activity rates and emission factors are incorporated in the calculation. Year-specific monthly temporal distributions for major sectors and gridded emissions at a resolution of 0. 1 °× 0. 1 ° distributed by multiple year-by-year spatial proxies are also developed. In China, the interaction between economic development and environmental protection causes large temporal variations in the emission trends. From 1996 to 2000, emissions of all three species showed a decreasing trend (by 9 %– 17 %) due to a slowdown in economic growth, a decline in coal use in non-power sectors, and the implementation of air pollution control measures. With the economic boom after 2000, emissions from China changed dramatically. BC and OC emissions increased by 46 % and 33 % to 1. 85 Tg and 4. 03 Tg in 2010. SO 2 emissions first increased by 61 % to 34. 0 Tg in 2006, and then decreased by 9. 2 % to 30. 8 Tg in 2010 due to the wide application of flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) equipment in power plants. Driven by the remarkable energy consumption growth and relatively lax emission controls, emissions from India increased by 70 %, 41 %, and 35 % to 8. 81 Tg, 1. 02 Tg, and 2. 74 Tg in 2010 for SO 2, BC, and OC, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations are used to quantify the emission uncertainties. The average 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of SO 2, BC, and OC emissions {{are estimated to be}} − 16 %– 17 %, − 43 %– 93 %, and − 43 %– 80 % for China, and − 15 %– 16 %, − 41 %– 87 %, and − 44 %– 92 % for India, respectively. Sulfur content, fuel use, and sulfur retention of hard coal and the actual FGD removal efficiency are the main contributors to the uncertainties of SO 2 emissions. Biofuel combustion related parameters (i. e., technology divisions, fuel use, and emission factor determinants) are the largest source of OC uncertainties, whereas BC emissions are also sensitive to the parameters of coal combustion in the residential and industrial sectors and the <b>coke-making</b> process. Comparing our results with satellite observations, we find that the trends of estimated emissions in both China and India are in good agreement with the trends of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and SO 2 retrievals obtained from different satellites...|$|E
