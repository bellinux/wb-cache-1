40|$|Abstract: Background: Focal {{cortical}} dysplasia (FCD) is {{the most}} common cause of intractable epilepsy in children and adolescent. Purpose: To evaluate the application value of magnetic source imaging (MSI) in treatment of mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI) -negative FCD patients with epilepsy. Methods: MSI characteristics of 17 cases of MRI-negative focal cortical dysplasia patients with epilepsy were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were treated by surgery. Results: In 17 patients, there were 3 cases of FCD Ia, 7 cases of FCDIb, 3 cases of FCDIIa and 4 cases of FCDIIb. FCD was located at temporal lobe <b>in</b> 8 <b>cases,</b> occipital lobe <b>in</b> 3 <b>cases,</b> frontal lobe <b>in</b> 2 <b>cases</b> and two lobes <b>in</b> 4 <b>cases.</b> <b>In</b> <b>follow-up,</b> 14 patients obtained satisfied curative effect. 1 patient was improved significantly and 2 patients were fine.

However, the loss of <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>follow-up</b> surveys is a common issue, often due to the death, disability, dispersion, and migration of the respondents (Ribisl et al. 1996).

Patients and Methods: This retrospective study included CPC cases that were managed with two-staged procedures in the Department of Paediatric Surgery, over a period of 12 years from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2011. Results: CPC comprised of 13. 71 % (97 of 707) of all anorectal malformations (ARM) and 28. 19 % (97 of 344) of high ARM. Eleven CPC cases (all males) were managed with two-staged procedures. Distribution of cases (Narsimha Rao et al. ′s classification) into types I, II, III, and IV were 1, 2, 6, and 2, respectively. Initial operative procedures performed were window colostomy (n = 6), colostomy proximal to pouch (n = 4), and ligation of colovesical fistula and end colostomy (n = 1). As definitive procedures, pouch excision with abdomino-perineal pull through (APPT) of colon in eight, and pouch excision with APPT of ileum in three were performed. The mean age at the time of definitive procedures was 15. 6 months (ranges from 3 to 53 months) and the mean weight was 7. 5 kg (ranges from 4 to 11 kg).

DESIGN: Retrospective observational case control study. METHODS: Evaluation of 37 cases of optic disk melanocytomas identified in the computer files of the ocular oncology unit of Jules Gonin Hospital to determine the clinical presentation of these tumors and the risk of complications. RESULTS: The tumor was asymptomatic <b>in</b> 28 <b>cases.</b> Visual acuity was normal <b>in</b> 26 <b>cases,</b> subnormal <b>in</b> 10 <b>cases,</b> and <b>in</b> one <b>case</b> it was reduced to 0. 1.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the usefulness of re-embolization for recanalization of PAVM using the triaxial system. Material and Methods: Recanalization was diagnosed in 8 patients with 13 PAVMs between June 2011 and November 2012, and re-embolization was attempted with a conventional microcatheter at first in all 13 PAVMs. However, in three of them it failed with the conventional microcatheter, and then the system was exchanged to the triaxial system. Thus, re-embolization using the triaxial system was performed in 3 PAVMs of 3 female patients, with a median age of 63 years (range, 46 – 73 years). We assessed technical success, complications, and outcome. Results: The disappearance of recanalization was confirmed by angiography in all re-embolization procedures (technical success rate was 100 %). Re-embolization was then successfully achieved inside the original coils, and no branch artery of normal lung tissue was embolized. There were no complications related with this procedure. The blood flow of recanalization was decreased <b>in</b> all <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> a <b>follow-up</b> of 27 - 33 months (median, 31). Conclusions: Triaxial system appears to be useful for recanalization of PAVM, especially <b>in</b> difficult <b>cases</b> with a conventional system...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{variable}} selection method from ℓ 0 -norm constrained regression, which {{is equivalent to the}} problem of finding the best subset of a fixed size. Our study focuses on two aspects, consistency and computation. We prove that the sparse estimator from such a method can retain all of the important variables asymptotically for even exponentially growing dimensionality under regularity conditions. This indicates that the best subset regression method can efficiently shrink the full model down to a submodel of a size less than the sample size, which can be analyzed by well-developed regression techniques for such <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> a <b>follow-up</b> study. We provide an iterative algorithm, called orthogonalizing subset selection (OSS), to address computational issues in best subset regression. OSS is an EM algorithm, and thus possesses the monotonicity property. For any sparse estimator, OSS can improve its fit of the model by putting it as an initial point. After this improvement, the sparsity of the estimator is kept. Another appealing feature of OSS is that, similarly to an effective algorithm for a continuous optimization problem, OSS can converge to the global solution to the ℓ 0 -norm constrained regression problem if the initial point lies in a neighborhood of the global solution. An accelerating algorithm of OSS and its combination with forward stepwise selection are also investigated. Simulations and a real example are presented to evaluate the performances of the proposed methods. Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author.

40|$|Abstract Objective The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) {{guidelines}} for management of ASC-H is colposcopic examination followed by biopsy. HPV testing (HPVT) is recommended after a negative biopsy result. More definitive interpretation of ASC-H could prevent discomfort and minimize the cost. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate association of various cytomorphological patterns of ASC-H with various clinical scenarios. Methods We reviewed SurePath&# 8482; (TriPath Imaging, Inc. Burlington, NC, USA) cervical smears interpreted as ASC-H in 161 women (mean age, 37 { 15 to 78 } years), over 24 months (2002 to 2003). HPVT (Digene, Hybrid Capture ® II HPV test, Digene Corporation, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was performed in 20 % of cases (33 / 161) and biopsy results were available <b>in</b> 54 <b>cases</b> (19 with and 35 without HPVT). Results HPVT was positive in 64 % (21 / 33) <b>cases,</b> and negative <b>in</b> 36 % (12 / 33) <b>cases.</b> <b>In</b> the <b>follow-up</b> biopsies of 71 % (15 / 21) of cases with positive HPVT, 27 % showed HPV changes or CIN 1, 27 % showed CIN 2 - 3, and 46 % were negative for epithelial abnormality. Follow-up biopsies from cases with negative HPVT (33 %, 4 / 12 cases), 8 % showed CIN 1 and 25 % were negative for any epithelial abnormality. Six cytomorphological patterns of ASC-H correlated with different clinical categories in relation to HPVT and biopsy results. 35 % (19 out of 54 ASC-H <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> which biopsy results were available) could be interpreted definitively as HSIL by cytopathology, 11 % (6 / 54) cases as LSIL with cyanophilic atypical parakeratotic pattern, and 31 % (17 / 54) cases as reactive, with HPV status. The interpretation had to be continued as ASC-H in 22 % (12 / 54) cases. Conclusion ASC-H demonstrated a spectrum of cytomorphological patterns. Some of these patterns in liquid-based cervical smears may be more specifically interpreted as LSIL, HSIL, or benign if HPV status is known. </p...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Penetrating {{keratoplasty}} and epikeratoplasty {{have been}} utilized in the surgical treatment of keratoconus. Comparison {{of the relative}} efficacy of each procedure in achieving visual outcomes has not been achieved due to limited numbers of <b>cases</b> and <b>follow-up</b> <b>in</b> previous series. METHODS: All patients who underwent either penetrating keratoplasty or epikeratoplasty for keratoconus between January 1987 and December 1997, and for whom at least 24 months of postoperative follow-up data for visual acuity was documented in the medical record, were included in this retrospective, nonrandomized, sequential comparative trial. The sole criteria for outcome in each group, {{as well as for}} comparison of the two groups, was Snellen visual acuity measured at the time of each follow-up with the presenting optical aid. RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met for 443 eyes treated with penetrating keratoplasty and 161 eyes treated with epikeratoplasty. Mean followup was 4. 3 years for penetrating kera [...] ...|$|R
