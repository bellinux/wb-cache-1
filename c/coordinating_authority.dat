The ICD is designed as a health care classification system, providing a system of diagnostic codes for classifying diseases, including nuanced classifications {{of a wide variety}} of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or disease. This system is designed to map health conditions to corresponding generic categories together with specific variations, assigning for these a designated code, up to six characters long.

2500|$|Although {{the most}} {{distinctive}} feature of MACs is their aircraft carrier function, they were conceived {{at a time}} when a shortage of shipping capacity threatened to undermine the Allied invasion of North Africa and beyond, and careful planning was needed to maximise their military effectiveness with as little detriment as possible to the carriage of cargo. [...] In their trading role, MACs operated {{under the aegis of the}} Ministry of War Transport, with day-to-day management falling to their owners or allotted shipping companies, while control of military aspects fell to the Admiralty, with a new section (the Trade Division DEMS Air Section) specially set up to act as <b>coordinating</b> <b>authority.</b> [...] The MACs operated on the North Atlantic route primarily in support of the 'ON' and 'HX' series of convoys. [...] An alternative plan to operate tanker MACs with CU convoys between the United Kingdom and Curaçao was rejected because convoys on that route were too fast. [...] Tankers on the North Atlantic route ordinarily loaded at New York City, but this was undesirable for the MACs because it would have been military wasteful to run them between the ON/HX landfall port of Halifax, Nova Scotia and New York, where convoys were already under the umbrella of land-based aircraft. [...] An 'oil pool' was therefore established at Halifax specifically to enable the tanker MACs to load there, while grain MACs were already able to use the port's pre-existing bulk loading facility. [...] The Firth of Clyde was initially designated as the UK terminus for all MAC cargoes because of its superior aviation training facilities. [...] On discovering that it would take more than a week to unload a single ship at the un-modernised facility in Glasgow, it was decided that grain MACs would discharge at Alexandra Dock, Liverpool, where two grain ships could be unloaded simultaneously in thirty-six hours. [...] Tanker MACs normally discharged on the Clyde, with the Mersey as an alternative.|$|E

A significant percentage of these farms produce commodities for the market. This productive dimension is often overlooked, however, as is the technical support needed by these farms. The privatization of national farm advisory systems (NFAS) has an impact on small-scale farming that should be better assessed. This paper, which looks at the characteristics of intangible services, helps demonstrate how the privatization of advisory services may have unexpected adverse effects on small farms. The dismantling of <b>coordinating</b> <b>authorities</b> has made these farms less visible as a target client. Less direct interaction with advisors makes it more difficult to co-produce knowledge that is relevant to their needs. In addition, back office activities such as scientific monitoring, building and updating databases and scientific experiments have been restructured in a way which does not support their interests...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There {{are three}} key driving forces behind the {{development}} of Internet Content Management Systems (CMS) a desire to manage the explosion of content, a desire to provide structure and meaning to content {{in order to make}} it accessible, and a desire to work collaboratively to manipulate content in some meaningful way. Yet the traditional CMS has been unable to meet the latter of these requirements, often failing to provide sucient tools for collaboration in a distributed context. Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) systems are networks in which every node is an equal participant (whether transmitting data, exchanging content, or invoking services) and there is an absence of any centralised administrative or <b>coordinating</b> <b>authorities.</b> P 2 P systems are inherently more scalable than equivalent client-server implementations as they tend to use resources at the edge of the network much more e↵ectively. This paper details the rationale and design of a P 2 P middleware for collaborative content management. ...|$|R
