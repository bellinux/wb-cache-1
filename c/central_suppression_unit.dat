40|$|An {{algorithm}} is described that quickly calculates minimum travel times between locations for initial response forest fire <b>suppression</b> <b>units.</b> The algorithm {{was developed for}} integration into wildfire planning simulation models to quickly identify fire <b>suppression</b> <b>units</b> with the fastest response to a fire during a simulation. While generally quite fast, network-based path minimization algorithms are not suitable for the wildfire problem since fires are often located away from existing network features, such as roads and trails. On the other hand, traditional raster-based least-cost path algorithms can take minutes, if not hours, to calculate each resource’s travel time, too slow to be effective within a simulation model. The algorithm {{presented in this paper}} enhances the raster-based technology, providing a multi-resolution approach. Our test results show the new algorithm dramatically increases the speed of calculations with only limited loss of accurac...|$|R
50|$|Alternating {{occlusion}} training, {{also referred}} to as electronic rapid alternate occlusion, is an approach to amblyopia and to intermittent <b>central</b> <b>suppression</b> in vision therapy, in which electronic devices such as programmable shutter glasses or goggles are used to block the field of view of one eye in rapid alternation.|$|R
40|$|PRAXIS is {{a second}} {{generation}} instrument that follows on from GNOSIS, {{which was the first}} instrument using fibre Bragg gratings for OH background suppression. The Bragg gratings reflect the NIR OH lines while being transparent to light between the lines. This gives a much higher signal-noise ratio at low resolution but also at higher resolutions by removing the scattered wings of the OH lines. The specifications call for high throughput and very low thermal and detector noise so that PRAXIS will remain sky noise limited. The optical train is made of fore-optics, an IFU, a fibre bundle, the Bragg grating unit, a second fibre bundle and a spectrograph. GNOSIS used the pre-existing IRIS 2 spectrograph while PRAXIS will use a new spectrograph specifically designed for the fibre Bragg grating OH suppression and optimised for 1470 nm to 1700 nm (it can also be used in the 1090 nm to 1260 nm band by changing the grating and refocussing). This results in a significantly higher transmission due to high efficiency coatings, a VPH grating at low incident angle and low absorption glasses. The detector noise will also be lower. Throughout the PRAXIS design special care was taken at every step along the optical path to reduce thermal emission or stop it leaking into the system. This made the spectrograph design challenging because practical constraints required that the detector and the spectrograph enclosures be physically separate by air at ambient temperature. At present, the instrument uses the GNOSIS fibre Bragg grating OH <b>suppression</b> <b>unit.</b> We intend to soon use a new OH <b>suppression</b> <b>unit</b> based on multicore fibre Bragg gratings which will allow increased field of view per fibre. Theoretical calculations show that the gain in interline sky background signal-noise ratio over GNOSIS may very well be as high as 9 with the GNOSIS OH <b>suppression</b> <b>unit</b> and 17 with the multicore fibre OH <b>suppression</b> <b>unit.</b> Comment: SPIE conference proceedings 915...|$|R

50|$|When {{the prism}} {{is placed in}} front of the non-deviating eye, the eye under the prism will move in and the fellow eye move out in the same way {{discussed}} above due to Herring’s law. However similarly to the response given by a patient with <b>central</b> <b>suppression,</b> the fellow eye will not make a fusional convergence movement back in as the image remains in the extended Panum’s fusional area. Diplopia is not appreciated in this instance.|$|R
50|$|Young {{children}} with strabismus normally suppress the visual field of one eye (or part of it), whereas adults who develop strabismus normally do not suppress and therefore suffer from double vision (diplopia). This {{also means that}} adults (and older children) have {{a higher risk of}} post-operative diplopia after undergoing strabismus surgery than young children. Patients who have undergone strabismus surgery at a young age often have monofixation syndrome (with peripheral binocular fusion and a <b>central</b> <b>suppression</b> scotoma).|$|R
25|$|Forces may operate {{surveillance}} cars. These cars can {{be marked}} or unmarked, {{and are there}} to gather evidence of any criminal offence.

In the United States, some police departments' vice, narcotics, and gang <b>suppression</b> <b>units</b> utilize vehicles that contain no identifiable police equipment (such as lights, sirens or radios) to conduct covert surveillance.|$|R
50|$|If the patient’s {{eyes are}} aligned and is bifoveal, the {{shifting}} {{of the image}} caused by the prism will produce a movement towards {{the apex of the}} prism (of the eye under the prism), and the fellow eye will have an outward movement in the same direction of the same magnitude due to Hering’s law of equal innervation. Simultaneously the fellow eye produces a fusional convergence movement as there is no <b>central</b> <b>suppression</b> of that fellow eye. This is a result of overcoming the diplopia experienced.|$|R

50|$|In vision therapy of {{amblyopia}} and of intermittent <b>central</b> <b>suppression,</b> {{liquid crystal}} devices {{have been used for}} purposes of enhanced occlusion therapy. In this scenario, the amblyopic patient wears electronically programmable liquid crystal glasses or goggles for continuously for several hours during regular everyday activities. Wearing the device encourages or forces the patient to use both eyes alternatingly, similar to eye patching, but rapidly alternating in time. The aim is to circumvent the patient's tendency to suppress the field of view of the weaker eye and to train the patient's capacity for binocular vision. The goggles mostly feature a much slower flicker rate than the more well-known active shutter 3D glasses.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{reports have}} {{described}} suppression scotomas, suppression varying {{with the type}} of strabismus and suppression confined to one half of the retina (hemiretinal suppression). Our findings show that suppression in all varieties of strabismus, {{with the exception of the}} monofixation syndrome, involves the whole of the visual field of the deviating eye except for its monocular temporal crescent. In the monofixation syndrome our findings show a small <b>central</b> <b>suppression</b> scotoma involving the fovea but leaving the rest of the visual field of the deviating eye unsuppressed. We could find no evidence to support the concept of hemiretinal suppression but found evidence to support the presence of a trigger mechanism for suppression which operates on a hemiretinal basis...|$|R

This paper proposes a computationally efficient echo suppression control algorithm to be used when increasing the bandwidth of an audio conferencing system, e. g. a conference telephone. The method {{presented in this paper}} gives a quality improvement, in the form of increased bandwidth, at a negligible extra computational cost. The increase in bandwidth is obtained through combining a conventional acoustic echo cancellation unit and an acoustic echo <b>suppression</b> <b>unit,</b> i. e. a hybrid echo canceller and suppressor. The proposed solution was implemented in a real-time system. Frequency analysis combined with subjective tests showed that the proposed method extends the bandwidth, while maintaining high quality. doi: 10. 1016 /j. sigpro. 2006. 07. 00...|$|R
40|$|GNOSIS is an OH <b>suppression</b> <b>unit</b> {{to be used}} in {{conjunction}} with existing spectrographs. The OH suppression is achieved using fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs), and will deliver the darkest near-infrared background of any ground-based instrument. Laboratory and on-sky tests demonstrate that FBGs can suppress OH lines by 30 dB whilst maintaing > 90 % throughput between the lines, resulting in a 4 mag decrease in the background. In the first implementation GNOSIS will feed IRIS 2 on the AAT. It will consist of a seven element lenslet array, covering 1. 4 " on the sky, and will suppress the 103 brightest OH lines between 1. 47 and 1. 70 μm.

40|$|Forest fire {{detection}} {{is a very}} important issue in the pre-suppression process. Timely detection allows the <b>suppression</b> <b>units</b> to reach the fire in its initial stages and this will reduce the suppression costs considerably. The autonomous forest {{fire detection}} principle is based on temporal contrast differences with the natural background and spatial characteristics of the smoke plume. The images are obtained from multiple staring black and white video cameras installed on a small platform in a tower. To reduce the bandwidth of the needed communication link with the operational centre, all processing is performed locally at the tower, The detection algorithm sends alarm messages with the co-ordinates of the location of the fire automatically and on request images or system status are sent...|$|R
40|$|The sky {{background}} is over 1000 times brighter in the near-infrared (NIR) {{than in the}} visible placing severe limitations on our ability to study the redshifted light from the distant objects formed in the early Universe from the ground. It is well-known that 98 % of the NIR background comes from the forest of bright and highly variable emission lines of atmospheric hydroxyl (OH) molecules. Unfortunately, astronomers {{have been unable to}} effectively remove this background from their data. We present the first OH <b>suppression</b> <b>unit,</b> GNOSIS, to utilize fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs). Simple FBGs are optical fibers with a periodic refractive index modulation imprinted within the fiber core, which induces a strong reflection in a narrow 0. 2 nm) stopband. GNOSIS utilizes 'OH suppression fibers' with a complex aperiodic refractive index modulation capable of removing the 103 brightest OH doublets between 1470 and 1700 nm by up 30 dB before dispersion and in a manner purely dependent on wavelength. The OH suppression fibers have high throughput 60 %) and over 90 % of the H band is available for spectroscopy. OH <b>suppression</b> <b>units</b> like GNOSIS may be utilized with any NIR telescope and spectrograph combination, but we commissioned GNOSIS at the 3. 9 -meter Anglo-Australian Telescope with the IRIS 2 spectrograph for our first demonstration. Commissioning reveals excellent suppression performance. Approximately 78 % of the OH lines were suppressed at the target level or greater. GNOSIS reduces the integrated background between 1500 and 1700 nm by a factor of ~ 9 but the signal-to-noise ratio is about the same as standard long-slit IRIS 2 observations due to retrofitting to an un-optimized spectrograph. Nevertheless, if paired with a fiber-optimized spectrograph FBG OH suppression technology shows great promise for high sensitivity NIR spectroscopy at moderate to low resolutions from the ground...|$|R

40|$|Inter-ocular {{suppression}} {{occurs when}} very different images are presented to each eye. Diplopia ensues if different images are superimposed and perceived. The brain removes this unfavourable viewing experience by suppressing one eye’s input to enable clear single vision. Inter-ocular suppression during visual development occurs {{in response to}} sufficiently disparate images caused by strabismus (misalignment of the visual axis) or anisometropia (uncorrected difference in refractive error), and if persistent may result in amblyopia. This is reduced visual sensitivity, usually in one eye, {{to a range of}} visual functions that cannot be corrected by refraction. Furthermore, binocular vision is reduced or absent. Depth and extent of suppression is measured across the central visual field in healthy participants with monocularly blurred vision, healthy participants with monocularly reduced luminance using neutral density (ND) filters, and participants with naturally disrupted binocular vision and/or amblyopia. Suppression of spatial stimuli defined by luminance (L) and luminancemodulated noise (LM) was compared to that measured for stimuli defined by contrast-modulated noise (CM), {{for which there is no}} change in mean luminance. For all stimuli suppression depth increased with increased imbalance of binocular input. Suppression was of a similar depth across the visual field with imposed blur and localised <b>central</b> <b>suppression</b> was found with ND filters. Microstrabismics showed <b>central</b> <b>suppression,</b> while strabismic amblyopes showed central in addition to hemifield suppression. Suppression for all participants was measured to be deeper for CM spatial stimuli than for LM spatial stimuli. This is suggested to be a result of CM stimuli engaging more binocular mechanisms of processing, than LM stimuli, thereby becoming more sensitive to disruptions of binocularity such as those produced in the participants in the present study. CM stimuli are therefore more sensitive to detecting suppression, which is associated with amblyopia...|$|R
40|$|Genetic, {{biochemical}} and pharmacological {{studies in}} humans and rodents have established that signalling through the G-protein-coupled melanocortin- 4 receptor (MC 4 R) by pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) -derived ligands plays {{a critical role}} in the <b>central</b> <b>suppression</b> of appetite. As a consequence, malfunction of this signalling system leads to the development of obesity. It has been shown previously that melanocortin signalling can be modulated by the type 1 transmembrane protein attractin, apparently acting as a co-receptor for the inhibitory ligand agouti. Work reported in this issue of Biochemical Journal (Haqq et al.) demonstrates that the cytosolic tail of an attractin-like protein (ALP) binds directly and specifically to the C-terminal region of MC 4 R, raising the possibility that proteins of the attractin family influence melanocortin receptor function through multiple mechanisms...|$|R
