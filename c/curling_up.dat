Then scenes of Rihanna walking {{on the beach and}} Rihanna <b>curling</b> <b>up</b> on the chair are shown. This is followed by her own and her partner holding each other closely in bed, sitting on different sides of a large bed, and other scenes featuring Rihanna singing through sheer curtains and drapery. In the video there are also black-white scenes showing Rihanna touching to a stone wall.|$|E
5|$|Nocturnal and solitary, the marbled {{electric}} ray can often be found lying the sea floor buried except for its eyes and spiracles. This slow-moving predator feeds almost exclusively on small bony fishes, which it ambushes from the bottom and subdues with strong electric bursts. It defends itself by turning towards the threat, swimming in a loop, or <b>curling</b> <b>up</b> with its underside facing outward, while emitting electric shocks to drive off the prospective predator. Its paired electric organs are capable of producing 70–80 volts of electricity. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by yolk and histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Mating takes place from November to January, and females bear litters of 3–32 pups every other year after a gestation period of 9–12 months. The newborn ray is immediately capable of using electricity to hunt.|$|E

25|$|Ant {{was brought}} to court at the Old Bailey. The charges against him, which {{included}} criminal damage and threatening members of the public, were reduced to a single count of causing affray, to which he pleaded guilty. He was fined £500 and ordered to psychiatric care with a suspended sentence. In June 2003, he was arrested again by police after a conflict with a neighbour resulted in him attempting to smash in the neighbour's patio door with a shovel, and then lying down on the concrete floor of a café basement with his trousers pulled down, <b>curling</b> <b>up,</b> and trying to sleep. Once again {{he was charged with}} affray and criminal damage and spent time in psychiatric wards. In September of that year he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983, and spent a further six months receiving in-patient psychiatric care. He was eventually granted a conditional discharge by the judge at Highbury Magistrates Court.|$|E
500|$|The Bengal slow loris is nocturnal and arboreal, {{occurring}} in both evergreen and deciduous forests. It prefers rainforests with dense canopies, and {{its presence in}} its native habitat indicates a healthy ecosystem. [...] It is a seed disperser and pollinator, {{as well as a}} prey item for carnivores. [...] Its diet primarily consists of fruit, but also includes insects, tree gum, snails, and small vertebrates. [...] In winter, it relies on plant exudates, such as sap and tree gum. [...] The species lives in small family groups, marks its territory with urine, and sleeps during the day by <b>curling</b> <b>up</b> in dense vegetation or in tree holes. [...] It is a seasonal breeder, reproducing once every 12–18months and usually giving birth to a single offspring. [...] For the first three months, mothers carry their offspring, which reach sexual maturity at around 20months. [...] The Bengal slow loris can live up to 20years.|$|E
500|$|Slow lorises {{are slow}} and {{deliberate}} climbers, and often {{hold on to}} branches with three of their four limbs. To move between trees, they carefully grip the terminal branches of the neighboring tree and pull themselves across the small gap. They will also grip branches with only their hind feet, lift themselves upright, and quickly launch forward with their hands to catch prey. Due to their slow movement, all lorises, including the slow lorises, have a specially adapted mechanism for defense against predation. Their slow, deliberate movement hardly disturbs the vegetation and is almost completely silent. Once disturbed, they immediately stop moving and remain motionless. In Indonesia, slow lorises are called malu malu or [...] "shy one" [...] because they freeze and cover their face when spotted. If cornered, they may adopt a defensive posture by <b>curling</b> <b>up</b> and lunging at the predator. The Acehnese name, buah angin ("wind monkey"), refers {{to their ability to}} [...] "fleetingly but silently escape". Little is known about the predation of slow lorises. Documented predators include snakes, the changeable hawk-eagle (Nisaetus cirrhatus), and Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii). Other potential predators include cats, sun bears (Ursus malayanus), binturongs (Arctictis binturong), and civets.|$|E

2500|$|The {{electric}} eel {{is unique}} among the Gymnotiformes in having large electric organs {{that can produce}} potentially lethal discharges {{that allow them to}} stun prey. Larger voltages have been reported, but the typical output is sufficient to stun or deter virtually any animal. Juveniles produce smaller voltages (about 100 V). [...] They can vary the intensity of the electric discharge, using lower discharges for hunting and higher intensities for stunning prey or defending themselves. They can also concentrate the discharge by <b>curling</b> <b>up</b> and making contact at two points along its body. When agitated, they can produce these intermittent electric shocks over at least an hour without tiring.|$|E
2500|$|Rapid eye {{movement}} sleep (REM), non-rapid {{eye movement}} sleep (NREM or non-REM), and waking represent {{the three major}} modes of consciousness, neural activity, and physiological regulation. NREM sleep itself is divided into multiple stages – N1, N2 and N3. Sleep proceeds in 90-minute cycles of REM and NREM, the order normally being N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM. As humans fall asleep, body activity slows down. Body temperature, heart rate, [...] breathing rate, and energy use all decrease. Brain waves get slower and bigger. The excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine becomes less available in the brain. Humans often maneuver to create a thermally friendly environment—for example, by <b>curling</b> <b>up</b> into a ball if cold. Reflexes remain fairly active.|$|E
