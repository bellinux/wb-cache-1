40|$|This is {{a summary}} of the 2015 Space <b>Cryogenics</b> Workshop that was held in Phoenix, Arizona, June 24 to 26, 2015. The {{workshop}} was organized by David Plachta and Jason Hartwig of the <b>Cryogenics</b> and Fluid Systems Branch at NASA Glenn Research Center, and continued the tradition of bringing together specialists in the field of space <b>cryogenics</b> to discuss upcoming and potential space missions, and the development of technologies that support or-more often-are enabling for the science and exploration goals of the world's space agencies. The workshop consisted of two days of talks and poster sessions, and provided ample opportunity for more informal discussions that foster collaborations and cooperation in the space <b>cryogenics</b> community. Selected papers from the workshop are published in a special issue of <b>Cryogenics,</b> which is expected to be published by the end of 2015...|$|R

5|$|Argon {{constitutes}} 0.934% {{by volume}} and 1.288% by {{mass of the}} Earth's atmosphere, and air is the primary industrial source of purified argon products. Argon is isolated from air by fractionation, most commonly by <b>cryogenic</b> fractional distillation, a process that also produces purified nitrogen, oxygen, neon, krypton and xenon. The Earth's crust and seawater contain 1.2 ppm and 0.45 ppm of argon, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Argon is {{produced}} industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid {{air in a}} <b>cryogenic</b> air separation unit; a process that separates liquid nitrogen, which boils at 77.3K, from argon, which boils at 87.3K, and liquid oxygen, which boils at 90.2K. About 700,000 tonnes of argon are produced worldwide every year.|$|E

In 2008, Khriachtchev et al. reported the preparation of HXeOXeH by the photolysis of water within a <b>cryogenic</b> xenon matrix. Deuterated molecules, HXeOD and DXeOH, have also been produced.|$|E

5|$|Wu {{chose to}} do this by taking a sample of {{radioactive}} cobalt-60 and cooling it to <b>cryogenic</b> temperatures with liquid gases. Cobalt-60 is an isotope that decays by beta particle emission, and Wu was also an expert on beta decay. The extremely low temperatures were needed {{to reduce the amount}} of thermal vibration of the cobalt atoms to practically nil. Also, Wu needed to apply a constant and uniform magnetic field across the sample of cobalt-60 in order to cause the spin axes of the atomic nuclei to line up in the same direction. For this <b>cryogenic</b> work, she needed the facilities of the National Bureau of Standards and its expertise in working with liquid gases, and traveled to its headquarters in Maryland with her equipment to carry out the experiments.|$|E
