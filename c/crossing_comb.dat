50|$|The easiest {{ascent of}} Whoap {{is from the}} Coldfell road, {{at the point where}} it forms a right angle at the base of Blakeley Raise and Burn Edge. A track leads down into the Calder valley at which point it <b>crosses</b> <b>Comb</b> Beck and {{continues}} along the valley until a crossing of the Calder itself is reached. At this point, there are two options; either turn left and ascend Whoap directly, or continue along the valley to the unnamed col separating Whoap from Lank Rigg before turning left for the final ascent. The second route is less strenuous, although the ground can become quite boggy after rainfall.|$|R
50|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{and management}} is also potentially complex. One possibility {{would be that}} the fuel be pressurized to 100 bar by a turbo pump, heated by the fuselage, sent through the turbine and accelerated to higher speeds than the air by a nozzle. The air and fuel stream are <b>crossed</b> in a <b>comb</b> like structure, which generates a large interface. Turbulence due to the higher speed of the fuel leads to additional mixing. Complex fuels like kerosene need a long engine to complete combustion.|$|R
40|$|A remarkably diverse set {{of traits}} maps to a region on mouse distal {{chromosome}} 1 (Chr 1) {{that corresponds to}} human Chr 1 q 21 â€“q 23. This region is highly enriched in quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control neural and behavioral phenotypes, including motor behavior, escape latency, emotionality, seizure susceptibility (Szs 1), and responses to ethanol, caffeine, pentobarbital, and haloperidol. This region also controls {{the expression of a}} remarkably large number of genes, including genes that are associated with some of the classical traits that map to distal Chr 1 (e. g., seizure susceptibility). Here, we ask whether this QTL-rich region on Chr 1 (Qrr 1) consists of a single master locus or a mixture of linked, but functionally unrelated, QTLs. To answer this question and to evaluate candidate genes, we generated and analyzed several gene expression, haplotype, and sequence datasets. We exploited six complementary mouse <b>crosses,</b> and <b>combed</b> through 18 expression datasets to determine class membership of genes modulated by Qrr 1. Qrr 1 can be broadly divided into a proximal part (Qrr 1 p) and a distal part (Qrr 1 d), each associated with the expression of distinct subsets of genes. Qrr 1 d controls RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, including the expression of ~ 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Qrr 1 d contains a tRNA cluster, and this is a functionally pertinent candidate for the tRNA synthetases. Rgs 7 and Fmn 2 are other strong candidates in Qrr 1 d. FMN 2 protein has pronounced expression in neurons, including in the dendrites, and deletion of Fmn 2 had a strong effect on the expression of few genes modulated by Qrr 1 d. Our analysis revealed a highly complex gene expression regulatory interval in Qrr 1, composed of multiple loci modulating the expression of functionally cognate sets of genes...|$|R
