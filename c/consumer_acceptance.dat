40|$|Along {{with the}} growth of e-commerce, {{advances}} in information and communication technologies (ICTs) have enabled online retailers to provide new services to enhance customer value and to increase sales. A notable example of these services or technologies is online product recommendation systems that serve to reduce consumer search costs and uncertainty or risks associated with the purchase of unfamiliar products. Electronic word-of-mouth systems (EWOMS) are online product recommendation systems that allow consumers to electronically post consumption information in the form of product reviews and/or product ratings. ^ This study examines the effects of EWOMS on a <b>consumer’s</b> <b>acceptance</b> of product recommendation. More specifically, this study explores relationships among several factors that may influence a <b>consumer’s</b> <b>acceptance</b> of product recommendation. Also, this study attempts to investigate the moderating effect of product types on the <b>consumer’s</b> recommendation <b>acceptance.</b> A proposed research model is developed based on the accessibility-diagnosticity model, information quality theory, source credibility theory, and theory of referent informational influence, along with ten hypotheses. ^ A lab experiment was conducted to test hypotheses empirically. The results confirmed the effect of information quality on EWOMS recommendation acceptance. The study also found that information diagnosticity and informant trustworthiness are critical factors for consumers’ acceptance of recommendation. For the elements of EWOMS, the rating indicator is a predictor of information diagnosticity and information quality, while the helpfulness indicator is a predictor of information quality and informant trustworthiness. Meanwhile, the source identity indicator does not have an effect on informant trustworthiness. ...|$|R

Despite increasing homogenisation, there are still differences between the European countries in this respect. The paper compares the factors influencing the acceptance of a novel food technology, nanotechnology, in France and Germany. The study's findings show that German consumers possess a more differentiated concept of nanotechnology, as they distinguish between different kinds of nanofood applications, whereas French consumers are more sceptical in general. This is reflected in a higher proportion of sceptical consumers in France, and a more positive attitude towards science and technology among German consumers...|$|R
