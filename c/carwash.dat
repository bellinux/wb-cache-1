25|$|Bikini car washes are warm-weather {{events which}} serve as fund raisers for a school, sport {{association}} (such as roller derby or auto racing) youth organization or charity, or as commercial promotion. Women in bikinis promote the event by {{standing on a}} roadside with colorful cardboard signs or posters, or wash the cars. Hooters restaurants have bikini car washes in the summer to attract customers. It was the theme for comedy films The Bikini <b>Carwash</b> Company (1992, director Ed Hansen) and The Bikini <b>Carwash</b> Company II (1993).|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} of discharge from <b>carwashes</b> to pollutant levels in stormwater was evaluated. Five <b>carwashes</b> and two outlets {{in the city}} of Toulouse (France) were selected. Water samples were collected from December 2006 to December 2007. Concentrations and loadings of classical water quality parameters (conductivity, pH, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen, phosphorus, ammonium, nitrate, suspended solid and volatile suspended solid) and five groups of organic compounds (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, lauryl alkyl benzene sulphonates, methyl tert-butyl ether and total hydrocarbons) were determined. The results suggest that the wastewater derived from <b>carwashes</b> was negligible compared to the volume and flow rates within the stormwater network. However, high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phosphorus and lauryl alkyl benzene sulphonates in liquid waste from <b>carwashes,</b> and the impact of these pollutants on stormwater quality could not be neglected...|$|R
40|$|Car washing consumes large {{quantities}} of water and results in large amounts of wastewater effluent being generated, but has received little attention as a potential source of water pollution globally. The study investigated the water use, wastewater effluent quality and toxicity of selected <b>carwashes</b> in City of Tshwane. Ten <b>carwashes</b> in the City of Tshwane were purposively selected and analysis done {{on a variety of}} water quality aspects including microbiological, toxicity, BOD,COD, oil and grease, anionic surfactants, sulphates, phosphates and heavy metals. The results obtained show that oil and grease exceeded the WHO and National Water Act standards of 2. 5 mg/L in all sites except CW 2 and Diesel range organics were significantly high in some sites (CW 4, 7 & 8) at 60. 5, 40 and 48. 8 mg/L. COD and BOD of the waste water exceeded the WHO standards of 30 mg/L and 60 mg/L in all sites except CW 2. Bacteria contamination was very high in all wastewater samples and all samples exhibited (mild to high) toxicity to Vibrio fischeri and high toxicity to Daphnia pulex except CW 2. These results suggest that wastewater from <b>carwashes</b> is high in some pollutants that may interfere with the receiving environment and municipal treatment systems and {{there is a need for}} responsible authorities to regulate the quality of effluent discharged into the environmentEnvironmental SciencesM.

500|$|Directed by Diane Martel, the single's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} features LaBelle as Lolita and shows how she seduces boys from her neighborhood. The video received a mixed response {{due to its}} treatment of sexuality. Welsh singer-songwriter Charlotte Church strongly criticized Martel's creation of sexually-explicit music videos, with the [...] "Lolita" [...] video highlighted as inappropriate and crass. The <b>carwash</b> scene was selected by Idolator as one instance in which the video emphasized sexuality. Despite the criticism, LaBelle's performance garnered positive reviews.|$|E
500|$|Affleck {{described}} {{the plot of}} the episode to have a [...] "grotesque" [...] and [...] "burlesque", yet [...] "plausible" [...] quality to it. In a scene in the episode, Homer, not knowing of Ned's age, accuses Ned of defrauding a <b>carwash</b> salesman. Affleck commented that the scene has [...] "a touch of music-hall" [...] in it, as it turns, from a scene in church, to a [...] "courtroom scene". He also noted that Ned's journey to Las Vegas can be compared to a Christian's travel to the temple of Mammon, a figure that in the Bible is characterized as the personification of wealth and greed.|$|E

5000|$|The band - which {{originally}} {{was composed of}} Tyson Stevens on bass guitar and lead vocals (later to be strictly the vocalist/songwriter), guitarists Chad Crawford, DJ Wilson (later to switch to bass) and Steve Kirby, Pouyan Afkary on keyboards, and drummer Peter Costa - recorded their self-financed debut EP, After Dark, {{while they were still}} in high school. After Dark was eventually re-released by Immortal Records in 2005. After nearly disbanding, they decided to pursue the band full-time, hosting nude <b>carwashes</b> and taking out loans to finance their tours.|$|R
500|$|There was a mixed {{critical}} {{response to}} the music video because of its use of sexuality. Baffuor Gyamfi of Mass Appeal praised LaBelle's presence in the video, writing that the singer's [...] "sex appeal dominates the video, no matter how weird things get." [...] LaBelle sex appeal was noted by Centric's Justin Joseph and Rap-Up. Welsh singer-songwriter Charlotte Church criticized Diane Martel for her creation of sexually-explicit music videos, and referenced the [...] "Lolita" [...] video as [...] "an objectionable little number"; Church also disapproved of the single's title. Idolator's Sam Lansky called the video [...] "crazy-sexy-cool", saying of the <b>carwash</b> scene – [...] "ikes!".|$|E
500|$|In the video, LaBelle {{plays the}} part of Lolita, defined as a [...] "badass baby girl", and seduces boys in her neighborhood. The video reverses the imagery of the {{heart-shaped}} glasses from Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film Lolita, by having the shirtless men wear them as they pursue LaBelle. She is shown watering flowers while wearing a skirt, dancing in the streets, and counting money while sitting on a lemonade stand. The men serve as LaBelle's [...] "heart eyed entourage" [...] and [...] "her own personal secret service"; they are seen washing a toy car in a <b>carwash</b> and presenting the singer with a life-sized teddy bear.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Nobody Sees" [...] {{features}} the entire line-up of Powderfinger in {{shot in the}} dark at nighttime with the Melbourne cityscape in the background. The group's lead vocalist, Bernard Fanning, who in all previous recordings would play keyboards and piano parts, did not record any of these parts for Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, as these duties were fulfilled by Benmont Tench. Though Tench performed the keyboard in the recording of the song, Fanning appears at the keyboard in the music video. The scenes of the band playing are intercut with video shots of a do-it-yourself <b>carwash,</b> and five shots of people by themselves. These people are all initially shown being still then as the video progresses, the people are shown performing highly energetic actions in slow motion. The actions shown include running, falling and jumping. There are instances through Ian Haug's guitar solo where John Collins' bass guitar and Darren Middleton's electric guitar are also shown in close-up and slow motion.|$|E
5000|$|Contamination {{of surface}} waters {{may arise from}} the rinse {{discharging}} to storm drains, which eventually drain to rivers and lakes. Chief pollutants in such wash-water include phosphates; oil and grease; and lead. This is almost exclusively an issue for home/driveway washing, and parking lot style charity washes. Professional <b>carwashing</b> is a [...] "non-point source" [...] of discharge that {{has the ability to}} capture these contaminants, normally in interceptor drains, so the contaminants can be removed before the water enters sanitary systems. (Water and contaminants that enter storm water drains does not undergo treatment, and is released directly into rivers, lakes and streams.) ...|$|R

50|$|Workers may join unions. All non-government {{workers may}} strike, {{though there are}} strict rules {{governing}} strikes. The ruling party is traditionally tied to labor, and some unions are government-run. Collective bargaining is technically permitted but is subject in practice to restrictions. Forced labor is illegal, but occurs, with many men and boys being trafficked into Angola for forced labor in construction and other sectors. Children under 14 {{are not allowed to}} work, but many children work on family farms, as street vendors, and in homes. Some children are forced to work as prostitutes, in the drug transport or sales, and as international couriers.

Virgin upheld this single restriction by printing a URL leading to the photographer's Flickr page on each of their ads. However, one picture, depicting 15-year-old Alison Chang at a fund-raising <b>carwash</b> for her church, caused some controversy when she sued Virgin Mobile. [...] The photo was taken by Alison's church youth counselor, Justin Ho-Wee Wong, who uploaded the image to Flickr under the Creative Commons license.

50|$|On November 21, {{the city}} {{government}} of Harbin announced that water supplies would be shut off at noon November 22 for four days for maintenance. Some residents of Harbin have complained that water {{in some parts of}} the city had been shut off much earlier than announced. The city also ordered all bathhouses and <b>carwashes</b> to close. At the same time as the enigmatic announcement, rumours ran wild about the possible cause of the shutoff, with some suggesting that an earthquake was imminent (causing some people to camp outdoors) and others claiming that terrorists had poisoned the city's water supply. The news of the shutoff caused panic buying of water, beverages, and foodstuffs in the city's supermarkets, while train tickets and flights out of the area were soon sold out. Meanwhile, dead fish were appearing along the banks of the Songhua upstream from Harbin, further compounding the fears of Harbin residents.|$|R
40|$|The European Water Framework Directive {{requires}} the monitoring of priority pollutants entering surface waters. This includes notably the stormwater network. In this study, {{the contribution of}} discharges from wash stations to pollution of the stormwater network was investigated. Six wash stations discharging wastewater into the stormwater network were selected: (i) one trucks wash station, (ii) two self-service stations for cars and motorcycles, (iii) two bus wash stations, (iv) one subway wash station. Classical parameters (conductivity, pH, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, suspended solid) and organic micropollutants (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Total Hydrocarbons (TH) and Methylterbutylether (MTBE)) were checked and measured. Concentrations were compared with limit values from Greater Toulouse decontamination service regulations for the discharge licenses of <b>carwashes,</b> and under the French decree for discharges into the natural environment and with the proposed directive from the European Parliament and the Council, dealing with environmental quality standards. The result showed a decrease of pollution downstream of the pre-treatments for subway wash stations but not for bus wash stations. According to the directives, the pre-treatment processes are not sufficient to justify a discharge into the stormwater network...|$|R

In early 2012 Businessweek reported that about $700 {{million in new}} building and campus upgrades was financed by heavy borrowing and Moody's Investors Service downgraded the school’s bonds to junk status in 2009 due to the school's position {{as one of the}} most heavily leveraged colleges in the country. [...] The U.S. Department of Education's [...] "financial responsibility" [...] score for the 2012 and 2013 fiscal year has High Point University scoring the highest possible score of 3, putting the university ahead of Elon University, Duke University, and Davidson College. Businessweek responded by inviting the school to make financial documents available to support any challenges to the article's accuracy, but none were offered in response. [...] In addition to questioning debt levels, Businessweek challenged whether the school's relationships with its lenders and vendors were at an appropriate arm's length, citing in particular that the school spends large marketing dollars with a public relations firm headed by the president's daughter. The college's claims to a growing reputation in higher education were challenged as being based more on high-end student amenities and marketing strategy than on solid academics.|$|R

The film, based on a highly sought-after [...] "road movie" [...] screenplay by Charles Eastman, was a disaster that tarnished the careers of all concerned. Critic Vincent Canby in his negative New York Times review on May 8, 1981 opined, [...] "he film's one bright spot is Barbara Harris, who plays Dinette as sincerely as possible under awful conditions. She looks great even when she's supposed to be tacky, and is genuinely funny {{as she tries to}} make sense out of Loyal's muddled philosophizing, which, of course, the screenplay requires her to match."

5000|$|The city of Tacoma {{has passed}} laws which have quashed {{any form of}} panhandling in public forums. Panhandling is banned {{anywhere}} which is within 15 feet of ATMs, bus stops, pay phones, parked cars, gas stations, outdoor stations, cafes and <b>carwashes</b> within the city. More specifically, it is illegal on buses, freeway ramps and on intersections. Moreover, in the hours between sunset and sunrise, it is prohibited entirely. Those who {{are found to be}} in breach of this ordinance could be penalized with 90 days in jail or be fined $1000. While the city of Arlington's laws are not as strict, with panhandling being banned anywhere within 300 feet of these certain areas, violators too can be met with the same harsh forms of punishment. A more controversial law was passed in October 2015, when the city of Everett amended previous code which categorised 'aggressive panhandling' as just a misdemeanour. This new law prevents begging 'in a manner that hinders or obstructs the free passage of any person in a public place' or begging that 'intentionally causes or attempts to cause another person to reasonably fear imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon their person, or upon property in their immediate possession.'
