5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{reflecting}} {{both the}} threat of possible invasion by the Soviet Union and the realities of nuclear warfare, Swiss military doctrine changed to that of a dynamic (mobile) defense that included missions for the Swiss Air Force outside of its territory, in order to defeat standoff attacks and nuclear threats, including the possibility of defensive employment of air-delivered nuclear weapons. However the inability to field an air force of sufficient <b>capability</b> <b>to</b> carry out such missions led to a return of traditional doctrine.|$|E

5|$|Bardanes's revolt {{temporarily}} weakened Byzantium, {{especially in}} its <b>capability</b> <b>to</b> {{deal with the}} Arab threat to the East, but Qasim's invasion was of limited scope, and his father's far larger intervention shortly after also resulted in no major military confrontations: Harun withdrew after a truce was concluded {{in exchange for a}} modest sum. Thus the revolt did not seriously affect the army or most of Anatolia. Nevertheless, it is indicative of the soldiers' dissatisfaction with Nikephoros, which would surface again in subsequent years and prove a constant source of trouble throughout his reign.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{experience}} in the First Sino-Japanese War convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, and Japan embarked on a program to modernize and expand its fleet.

A framework linking KM and HRM is then applied to the development of leadership and management <b>capabilities</b> <b>to</b> support sustainability. FINDINGS - Provides a means by which to promote sustainability through effective KM and HRM linkages and suggests means by which organisations can develop leadership and management <b>capabilities</b> <b>to</b> support sustainability across business, environmental and social justice contexts. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - This paper fills a gap in current literature by providing managers with a framework for addressing sustainability issues and for developing individual and organisational <b>capabilities</b> <b>to</b> support sustainability through KM and HRM practices...|$|R
