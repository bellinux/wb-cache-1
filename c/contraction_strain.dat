40|$|McKibben {{artificial}} {{muscles are}} one of the most pragmatic contractile actuators, offering performances similar to skeletal muscles. The McKibben muscles operate by pumping pressurized fluid into a bladder constrained by a stiff braid so that tensile force generated is amplified in comparison to a conventional hydraulic ram. The need for heavy and bulky compressors/ pumps makes pneumatic or hydraulic McKibben muscles unsuitable for microactuators, where a highly compact design is required. In an alternative approach, this article describes a new type of McKibben muscle using an expandable guest fill material, such as temperature-sensitive paraffin, to achieve a more compact and lightweight actuation system. Two different types of paraffin-filled McKibben muscles are introduced and compared. In the first system, the paraffinfilled McKibben muscle is simply immersed in a hot water bath and generates isometric forces up to 850 mN and a free <b>contraction</b> <b>strain</b> of 8. 3 % at 95 C. In the second system, paraffin is heated directly by embedded heating elements and exhibits the maximum isometric force of 2 N and 9 % <b>contraction</b> <b>strain.</b> A quantitative model is also developed to predict the actuation performance of these temperature sensitive McKibben muscles as a function of temperature...|$|E

We hypothesized that LA systolic synchronous contraction as a functional measure of LA remodeling is deranged in patients with paroxysmal AF and HF. Methods: We performed a nested case-control analysis with 1 : 2 matching for 39 cases of paroxysmal AF (n= 28, in sinus rhythm during cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)) and HF (n= 14, AF+HF; n= 3) and 78 controls with similar demographic and clinical characteristics at the baseline (Table 1). LA circumferential (short axis) and longitudinal strain rate (horizontal long axis) were measured using Multi-modality Tissue Tracking (Toshiba, Japan) from short and long-axis cine CMR images. Circumferential LA systolic dyssynchrony among 18 LA segments (6 segments x 3 slices) was evaluated as; Standard Deviation (SD) of time to pre atrial <b>contraction</b> <b>Strain</b> rate (PreA Src) and Peak systolic strain rate (Peak Srac) (Figure 1). Similarly, longitudinal LA dyssynchrony parameters (among 6 segments) were: SD-Time to pre-atrial <b>contraction</b> <b>strain</b> rate (PreA SrL) and SD-Time to peak systolic strain rate (Peak-SraL). Wilcoxon-rank sum test (non-parametric) or two sample t-test (parametric) were used for comparison between the groups. Results: In participants during MESA exam 5 (age 74 ± 8 years, 51. 4 % men), systolic circumferential dyssynchrony (SD-TP-PreA Src, msec) was significantly higher in the cases compared to controls (45. 06 vs. 28. 73, p< 0. 010). Similarly, case group had greater longitudinal dyssynchrony than controls; SD-TP PreA SrL (51. 62 vs. 36. 43, p= 0. 001) and SD-TP-Peak SraL (45. 23 vs. 35. 92, p= 0. 027) (Table 1).

The aim of this prospective, longitudinal {{study was to investigate}} whether exercise {{is able to}} influence left and right atrial morphology and function also in female athletes. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed before season and after 16 weeks of intensive training in 24 top-level female athletes.

40|$|Fibrous {{active network}} {{structures}} whose properties are regulated by motor proteins, or simply motors, are fundamental to life. Here, a full elastic and three dimensional model for such networks and motors is presented. The effects of surface anchoring are accounted for and we demonstrate that for unidirectional motors two basic contractile phases emerge in these systems. The transition {{is governed by}} a single parameter (tb/tc) which is {{the ratio of the}} breaking strain (tb) and the motility limiting strain (tc) of the motors. For tb/tc [less, similar] 2 and clamped boundaries, the network ruptures and formation of local asters occurs with a high density of motors at the centre and the fibers radially spanning out. This phase displays <b>contraction</b> <b>strain</b> during the formation of asters but the network stress is relaxed once the asters have emerged, demonstrating that the formation of aster-like structures provides a mechanism for stress relaxation. For 2. 7 [less, similar] tb/tc the network remains intact, but reaches a force equilibrium with a high <b>contraction</b> <b>strain</b> in the case of clamped boundaries. Between these two limits the network is partly ruptured. Experimental measurements (e. g. J. T. Nishizaka, H. Miyata, H. Yoshikawa, S. Ishiwata and K. Kinosita Jr., Nature, 1995, 377, 251 and J. F.

This is perhaps not a coincidence and may well be an important factor contributing to cellular dynamics. In the case of free boundaries the network collapses onto one single aster.

Despite having constrained their gross geometry, we have a relatively poor understanding of the processes controlling the nucleation and growth (i. e., the kinematics) of polygonal fault systems. In this study we use high-resolution 3 -D seismic reflection and borehole data from the northern North Sea to undertake a detailed kinematic analysis of faults forming part of a seismically well-imaged polygonal fault system hosted within the up to 1, 000 m thick, Early Palaeocene-to-Middle Miocene mudstones of the Hordaland Group. Growth strata and displacement-depth profiles indicate faulting commenced during the Eocene to early Oligocene, with reactivation possibly occurring in the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. Mapping the position of displacement maxima on 137 polygonal faults suggests that the majority (64 %) nucleated in the lower 500 m of the Hordaland Group. The uniform distribution of polygonal fault strikes in the area indicates that nucleation and growth were not driven by gravity or far-field tectonic extension as has previously been suggested.

40|$|The {{timing of}} muscle {{recruitment}} alters series elastic function during lengthening contractions During eccentric contractions muscles are actively lengthened to dissipate energy. While eccentric contractions are physiologically common, muscle injury and soreness are {{often associated with}} actively lengthened muscle fibers. It {{has been suggested that}} ser ies e last ic e lements (tendons and aponeuroses) may act as mechanical buffers to mitigate these potentially damaging outcomes. During eccentric <b>contractions,</b> <b>strain</b> energy is initially loaded into series elastic elements before tendon recoil stretches the muscle fascicles. By temporarily storing elastic energy, tendons can slow the rate of stretch applied directly to fascicles and can therefore function in attenuating power. Here we examine how the timing of muscle activation relative to muscle lengthening may alter the effective utilization of tendons in attenuating power. Using an in vitro muscle-tendon preparation, we test the prediction that muscle recruitment in anticipation of lengthening can reduce the rate and magnitude of stretch applied directly to muscle fascicles. Plantaris muscles of Rana catesbeiana (bullfrog) were instrumented with sonomicrometry crystals to measure muscle fascicle length. MTU length, force and power were measured by a servomotor. The MTU was lengthened at a constant speed while being stimulated at either 50 ms before (early-start), concurrent with, or 50 ms after (late-start) MTU lengthening.

The LA volume, emptying fraction, strain (S), and strain rate (SR) were assessed by tissue-tracking cardiac magnetic resonance. The patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (n= 18) had greater LA volumes (Vmax and Vmin; P= 0. 02 and P< 0. 001, respectively), lower LA total emptying fraction (P< 0. 001), lower LA maximum and pre-atrial <b>contraction</b> <b>strains</b> (Smax and SpreA; P< 0. 001 and P= 0. 01, respectively), and lower absolute values of LA SR during left ventricular (LV) systole and early diastole (SRs and SRe; P= 0. 005 and 0. 03, respectively) than those without stroke/transient ischemic attack (n= 151). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the LA reservoir function, including total emptying fraction, Smax, and SRs, was associated with stroke/transient ischemic attack (odds ratio 0. 94, 0. 91, and 0. 17; P= 0. 03, 0. 02, and 0. 04, respectively) after adjusting for the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score and LA Vmin.

40|$|To {{further study}} {{regional}} deformation characteristic {{in the southeast}} margin of Ordos Block during the period between the Alanshan M 5. 8 and Yuncheng M 4. 4 earthquake swarm, we analyze continuous GPS sites around the study area. The time-varying strain parameters removed a linear trend deviated from the background state in varying degrees since April, 2015, and began to turn back {{at the end of}} the year 2015, meanwhile, the maximum extension strain and shear strain have the bigger variation relative to others. The GPS measurement also shows that the eastward displacement rate of the stations decreases during 2015 – 2016 in varying degrees compared to 2011 – 2015, and the variation is closely related to its geologic structural location. The differential movement between the stations is converted into regional strain accumulation due to the fault locking. Furthermore, during 2015 – 2016, the maximum extension rate oriented at near NS direction obviously increased, and the maximum <b>contraction</b> <b>strain</b> direction is changed from NW to EW direction, which contributes to strengthen extension and shear strain of the NE-striking faults, it's consistent with the regional background strain state of Shanxi seismic zone, this may be an important contributor to occurrence of M 4. 4 earthquake swarm in Yuncheng basin...|$|E
40|$|Actuators are {{devices that}} exhibit {{reversible}} {{change in their}} shape or volume or generate force when externally stimulated. Because of their very similar operation style to biological muscles, actuator materials are also known as artificial muscles. These materials are in demand for many applications, such as medical devices and robotics. These applications normally require an inexpensive actuator system that can offer high force, high strain, and high power density {{in a relatively short}} period of time. The device packaging and size of the actuator are also important parameters as currently most of the applications desire very compact and lightweight systems. Furthermore, low electricity consumption also as a last requirement has a significant effect on the actuation system by increasing the efficiency of the entire system. Producing all of the above requirements in one device is currently a challenge for engineers and scientists. In this thesis, a new contractile artificial muscle system is introduced than can offer most of the above requirements to satisfy the current expectations of these devices. Chapter 1 of this thesis focuses on a literature review of prominent available artificial muscles and comparing them with biological muscle performance for better understanding of their advantages and disadvantages. Chapter 2 investigates the effect of the inner tube material and muscle geometry on a small hydraulic McKibben artificial muscle as well as the possibility of running this system with a compact, low voltage water pump. This chapter also introduces a new equation that is able to predict static muscle performance notably more accurately than previous models. Chapter 3 illuminates the possibility of three-dimensional printing the braided sleeve used in McKibben artificial muscles to have more control on the manufacturing process of such devices. In Chapter 4, the fluid normally used in conventional McKibben muscles is substituted with a temperature sensitive material to eliminate the need of the pump/compressor and piping to introduce a more compact device. The new muscles were stimulated either by immersing in a hot water bath or using a heating filament. A <b>contraction</b> <b>strain</b> of 9 % and 2 N isometric force were produced. A new equation is also introduced to predict the performance of this type of McKibben muscles with temperature as the driving force. Chapter 5 introduces a novel miniature type of McKibben artificial muscle by using a conductive braided sleeve and eliminating the need for the inner tube. The electricity consumption of this muscle is as low as 2. 5 V. The muscle weight is only 0. 14 gr with a diameter of 1. 4 mm. The muscle generates a tensile stress of 50 kPa and <b>contraction</b> <b>strain</b> of 10 %. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes this study and also represents some potential future works...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} left atrial (LA) function using {{speckle tracking}} based strain (SPTS) in systolic heart failure (SHF) patients. Background: LA changes occur {{in patients with}} SHF and LA enlargement is commonly found by echocardiography. New speckle tracking based strain {{can be used to}} detect left atrial changes in SHF. Materials and methods: Forty patients with clinical (SHF), EF <  40 %, NYHA class II-IV and normal sinus rhythm were compared with twenty-five age and sex matched healthy controls. Conventional echo was done where the LV dimensions, volumes, EF, wall thickness & LA diameter were measured. LA total emptying, passive and active volumes & fractions were calculated in both apical 4 & 2 chamber views. Peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS), Peak atrial <b>contraction</b> <b>strain</b> (PACS), LA strain at the end of LA contraction (Post-A strain) and LA contraction systolic index (LA CSI) were calculated from each LA wall. LV global strain (LVGS) was measured in apical 4, 2 and 3 chamber views and was averaged. Results: SHF patients had significantly higher LA diameter volumes but lower LA fractions, Also, there were significantly lower LA PALS, PACS, Post-A and higher LA CSI, however, the LA strain parameters were negatively correlated with the NYHA class and positively correlated with LV global strain. Conclusion: In patients with SHF, LA function is significantly reduced. Moreover, LA reservoir & booster pump function correlate negatively with heart failure symptoms and positively with LV global strain...|$|E
40|$|Disuse {{of weight}} bearing bones {{has been shown}} to cause bone loss. This poses a health concern for people exposed to microgravity, such as astronauts. Animal studies are used to study factors related to bone loss and {{countermeasures}} to prevent bone loss. This study used a hindlimb unloaded (HU) rat model to simulate microgravity and a muscle stimulation countermeasure to simulate resistive exercise. Uniaxial strain gages were implanted on the antero-medial aspect of the proximal tibia to measure the mechanical strain during a typical exercise session. In a separate but parallel study, the exercise was shown to be an effective countermeasure to disuse related bone loss. The current study sought to understand the loading of the bone during the exercise. To determine if the strain response changes during a protocol using this countermeasure, strains were measured on a group of weight bearing animals and a group that were hind limb unloaded and received the countermeasure for 21 days. Strain magnitudes and rates were considered and related to torques at the ankle joint. No significant differences in strain magnitudes were noted between the baseline control group and the hindlimb unloaded group that received the countermeasure. The two kinds of contractions used in an exercise session are isometric and eccentric. The isometric contractions are used to adjust the stimulation equipment for the eccentric contractions, which constitute the exercise. Peak strain levels during the isometric contractions ranged from 900 to 2200 microstrain while the eccentric were 38 % lower and ranged from 600 to 1400. Eccentric strain rates were 62 % lower than the isometric <b>contractions</b> <b>strain</b> rates. These results indicate that the strain environment during the isometric contractions may be causing more of the osteogenic response than the eccentric contractions, which have previously been thought to be the primary part of the countermeasure...|$|R
40|$|Aims The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of a pelvic floor muscle (PFM) {{rehabilitation}} program on incontinence symptoms, PFM function, and morphology in older women with SUI. Methods Women 60 years old and older with at least weekly episodes of SUI were recruited. Participants were evaluated before and after a 12 -week group PFM rehabilitation intervention. The evaluations included 3 -day bladder diaries, symptom, and quality of life questionnaires, PFM function testing with dynamometry (force) and electromyography (activation) during seven tasks: rest, PFM maximum voluntary <b>contraction</b> (MVC), <b>straining,</b> rapid-repeated PFM <b>contractions,</b> a 60 sec sustained PFM contraction, a single cough and three repeated coughs, and sagittal MRI recorded at rest, during PFM MVCs and during straining to assess PFM morphology. Results Seventeen women (68. 9 ± 5. 5 years) participated. Following the intervention the frequency of urine leakage decreased and disease-specific quality of life improved significantly. PFM function improved significantly: the participants were able to perform more rapid-repeated PFM contractions; they activated their PFMs sooner when coughing and they were better able to maintain a PFM contraction between repeated coughs. Pelvic organ support improved significantly: the anorectal angle was decreased and the urethrovescial junction was higher at rest, during <b>contraction</b> and while <b>straining.</b> Conclusions This study indicated that improvements in urine leakage were produced along with improvements in PFM co-ordination (demonstrated by the increased number of rapid PFM contractions and the earlier PFM activation when coughing), motor-control, pelvic organ support...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of turbulence structure, parameterized by two point correlations, on the return-to-isotropy process is examined under controlled conditions. In {{order to determine}} the {{influence of}} structure, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of return-to-isotropy in homogeneous, anisotropic turbulence is performed on meshes of 5123 and 512 x 512 x 1024. Isotropic turbulence is generated by mechanical stirring (as in a wind tunnel). Anisotropy is then generated by one of four fundamentally different mean strains, axisymmetric expansion and <b>contraction,</b> plane <b>strain,</b> and pure rotation. Each strain produces very different structure within the turbulence. The influence on the return-to-isotropy process of the initial structure (parameterized by the two-point correlations) as well as Reynolds number and initial length scale, is characterized and used to calibrate the Oriented-Eddy Collision (OEC) turbulence model developed by Martell and Perot [1]. In addition, this data provides critical information for other turbulence models which incorporate turbulence structure...|$|R
