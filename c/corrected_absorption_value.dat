In methylated thioureas both electronic and steric effects influence the acidity constants. These effects appear to be of comparable magnitude. The results on the dithiocarbamate and trithiocarbonate show that in these compounds the basicity is determined by the negative inductive rather than by the positive mesomeric effect of the methylmercapto group. The amino group exerts a strong mesomeric action as expected. Copyright © 1962 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinhei...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe collisional (or free-free) {{absorption}} of soft x rays in warm dense aluminium remains an unsolved problem. Competing {{descriptions of the}} process exist, two of which we compare to our experimental data here. One of these {{is based on a}} weak scattering model, another uses a corrected classical approach. These two models show distinctly different behaviors with temperature. Here we describe experimental evidence for the {{absorption of}} 26 -eV photons in solid density warm aluminium (T-e approximate to 1 eV). Radiative x-ray heating from palladium-coated CH foils was used to create the warm dense aluminium samples and a laser-driven high-harmonic beam from an argon gas jet provided the probe. The results indicate little or no change in absorption upon heating.

An original method of manufacturing the composite tubes with vacuum infusion together with an expandable foam core to form multi-cellular structures was used. Low cost, 24 k tow carbon fibre braids were used and their performance was compared with that of the more expensive l 2 k tow size fibres. The specimens produced were axially crushed at constant quasi-static low velocities and at higher impact velocities using an instrumented falling weight machine. Load displacement data gathered from such tests were used to evaluate the test specimens with respect to their specific energy <b>absorption</b> <b>values.</b> The effects of a number of parameters including fibre tow size, braid architecture, resin content and loading type were evaluated. From the experimental results analysed from the test specimens it can be concluded that: - The 24 k fibre showed lower specific energy <b>absorption</b> <b>values</b> than specimens made from l 2 k fibre.

40|$|The Multi-Angle Absorption Photometer (MAAP) is a widely-used {{instrument}} for aerosol black carbon (BC) measurements. In this paper, we show correction methods for an artifact found {{to affect the}} instrument accuracy in environments characterized by high black carbon concentrations. The artifact occurs after a filter spot change – as BC mass is accumulated on a fresh filter spot, the attenuation of the light (raw signal) is weaker than anticipated. This causes a sudden decrease, followed by a gradual increase in measured BC concentration. The artifact {{is present in the}} data when the BC concentration exceeds ~ 3 μg m − 3 at the typical MAAP flow rate of 16. 7 L min − 1 or 1 m 3 h − 1. The artifact is caused by erroneous dark counts in the photodetector measuring the transmitted light, in combination with an instrument internal averaging procedure of the photodetector raw signals. It was found that, in addition to the erroneous temporal response of the data, concentrations higher than 9 μg m − 3 (at the flow rate of 16. 7 L min − 1) are underestimated by the MAAP. The underestimation increases with increasing BC accumulation rate. At a flow rate of 16. 7 L min − 1 and concentration of about 24 μg m − 3 (BC accumulation rate ~ 0. 4 μg min − 1), the underestimation is about 30 %. There are two ways of overcoming the MAAP artifact. One method is by logging the raw signal of the 165 ° photomultiplier measuring the reflected light from the filter spot. As this signal is not affected by the artifact, it can be converted to approximately <b>correct</b> <b>absorption</b> and BC <b>values.</b> However, as the typical print formats of the MAAP do not give the reflected signal as an output, a semi-empirical correction method was developed based on laboratory experiments to correct for the results in the post-processing phase. The correction function was applied to three MAAP datasets from Gual Pahari (India), Beijing (China), and Welgegund (South Africa). In Beijing, the results could also be compared against a photoacoustic spectrometer (PAS). The correction improved the quality of all three MAAP datasets substantially, even though the individual instruments operated at different flow rates and in different environments...|$|R

Metal lines absorb 2. 3 +/- 0. 5 %, and LLS absorb 1. 0 +/- 0. 4 % leaving 11. 8 +/- 1. 0 % from the lower density bulk of the IGM. Averaging over Delta z= 0. 1 or 154 Mpc, the dispersion is 6. 1 +/- 0. 3 % including LLS and metal lines, or 3. 9 (+ 0. 5, - 0. 7) % for the lower density IGM alone, consistent with the usual description of large scale structure.
