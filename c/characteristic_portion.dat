60|$|We {{now come}} to the Amphibia, which are {{represented}} in the Seychelles by two tailless and two serpent-like forms. The frogs are Rana mascareniensis, found also in Mauritius, Bourbon, Angola, and Abyssinia, and probably all over tropical Africa; and Megalixalus seychellensis a peculiar tree-frog having allies in Madagascar and tropical Africa. It is found, Dr. Wright informs me, on the Pandani or screw-pines; and as these form a very <b>characteristic</b> <b>portion</b> of the vegetation of the Mascarene Islands, all the species being peculiar and confined each to a single island or small group, we may perhaps consider it as {{a relic of the}} indigenous fauna of that more extensive land of which the present islands are the remains.|$|E
60|$|Insects--Coleoptera.--The {{total number}} of species of beetles {{hitherto}} observed at St. Helena is 203, but of these no less than seventy-four are common and wide-spread insects, which have certainly, in Mr. Wollaston's opinion, been introduced by human agency. There remain 129 which {{are believed to be}} truly aborigines, and of these all but one are found nowhere else on the globe. But in addition to this large amount of specific peculiarity (perhaps unequalled anywhere else in the world) the beetles of this island are equally remarkable for their generic isolation, and for the altogether exceptional proportion in which the great divisions of the order are represented. The species belong to thirty-nine genera, of which no less than twenty-five are peculiar to the island; and many of these are such isolated forms {{that it is impossible to}} find their allies in any particular country. Still more remarkable is the fact, that more than two-thirds of the whole number of indigenous species are Rhyncophora or weevils, while more than two-fifths (fifty-four species) belong to one family, the Cossonidæ. Now although the Rhyncophora are an immensely numerous group and always form a large portion of the insect population, they nowhere else approach such a proportion as this. For example, in Madeira they form one-sixth of the whole of the indigenous Coleoptera, in the Azores less than one-tenth, and in Britain one-seventh. Even more interesting is the fact that the twenty genera to which these insects belong are every one of them peculiar to the island, and in many cases have no near allies elsewhere, so that we cannot but look on this group of beetles as forming the most <b>characteristic</b> <b>portion</b> of the ancient insect fauna. Now, as the great majority of these are wood borers, and all are closely attached to vegetation and often to particular species of plants, we might, as Mr. Wollaston well observes, deduce the former luxuriant vegetation of the island from the great preponderance of this group, even had we not positive evidence that it was at no distant epoch densely forest-clad. We will now proceed briefly to indicate the numbers and peculiarities of each of the families of beetles which enter into the St. Helena fauna, taking them, not in {299} systematic order, but according to their importance in the island.|$|E
40|$|Cell {{extracts}} {{and culture}} filtrates were prepared from several mycobacterial species {{and subjected to}} two-dimensional acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The cell preparations were first electrophoresed in a 7 % homogeneous gel followed by a second electrophoresis, {{at right angles to}} the first separation, in a 2 to 30 % linear gel gradient slab. Because the stained slab resembled a “fingerprint” or “peptide map,” this procedure has been called “electroprotein mapping. ” More than 200 protein-staining spots were detected in several of the cell extracts, each map being characteristic of the species examined. The single most <b>characteristic</b> <b>portion</b> of each map was the region between the 16 and 30 % gel concentrations. This region consisted of several small-molecular-weight components (many of peptide proportions) which together appeared as the most anodic band in the 7 % gel column (first separation). The number and location of these components in the linear gel slab (second separation) were specific for each species tested. By electrophoresis of molecular-weight markers (i. e., albumin, myoglobin, cytochrome c) with and across (transverse electrophoresis) the gel gradient, the relative molecular weights of the unknown cell extract components could be estimated. These results suggest that two-dimensional acrylamide gel electrophoresis is a useful tool for the characterization of mycobacterial cell constituents...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There are two {{purposes}} of this research. One of the research purposes is to clarify {{the relation between the}} creation and the memory in the design. Another one research purpose is a proposal of the design methodology that promotes the creation. To consider the relation between the designer’s memory that was the first purpose and the creation in the design, the document concerning the creation and the memory was investigated. As a result of consideration, the memory in the creation process circulates while forming the concept to the design by studying the experience of creation. And, we thought that the circulation structure formed a spiral type. The proposal of the design methodology that promoted the creation was tried based on this hypothesis. We proposed the design methodology to which the process of intentionally recollecting the creation process in the <b>characteristic</b> <b>portion</b> of the work was taken to the design process. Next, we considered the role of the computer in the design, and produced the tool that was expressible {{of the structure of the}} memory in the creation process. The user takes the image data of the work in the D. S. I., and inputs the memory of the creation process according to the next three stages. Then, the structural model of the memory allocating three attributes “Design Element”, “Episode”, and “Characteristic Portion ” is expressed as for three axes that express 3 DCG. The case where an own tendency to create is understood recollecting a past work by having produced the tool that expressed the structure of this making of the designer the recollection of the produced work and the recorded memory by 3 DCG was able to be found. Therefore, one example of the design methodology that promoted the creation was able to be presented...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Survey by survey {{comparisons}} of marriage rates in nationally representative cross-sectional datasets suggest that marriages are declining in South Africa. For African South African women of working age (between 15 and 59 years) marriage rates declined from 38. 7 percent in 1995 to 31. 4 percent in 2004. This change in marriage patterns motivated {{the current research}} and we asked whether the drop in marriage rates indicates a real generational shift in marital behaviour, or if this {{can be explained by}} changes in sampling frames in the independent surveys. The broad objective of the study is to investigate declining marriages in post-apartheid South Africa. The specific objectives are threefold. First, we construct a synthetic panel dataset from the 1995 to 1999 annual October Household Surveys and from the 2000 to 2006 September wave of the biannual Labour Force Surveys. Using the pseudo panel, we make use of the Age-Period-Cohort Model to disentangle marriage trends into age, period, and cohort effects in order to establish whether the change in marital patterns observed in post-apartheid South Africa reflects a real decline in marriages. Having established that the change in marriage rates indeed reflects a generational change in marital behaviour, the second objective focuses on the determinants of women's marriage decisions. To this end, we attempt to account for the interdependence between female labour force participation and marriage decisions by estimating simultaneous equation models for each cross-sectional year from 1995 to 2006. Availability of women's jobs in a District Council locality is used as an exogenous shock in the labour force participation equation to identify the marriage equation. The analysis finds that age, education, labour market status, availability of potential partners in the local marriage market, and location are all important factors in a woman's marriage decision. While the results show that labour force participation and a high level of education lower the probability of marriage, age and availability of potential partners are found to increase it. The third objective is an explanation of the trend towards fewer marriages by relating the changing effects of the variables to the marriage decline. Using the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition technique, we establish that marriage decline is predominantly explained by a change in the marital behaviour of African South African women, rather than change in the distribution of the characteristics that determine marriage decisions. A detailed decomposition of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>portion</b> of the marriage decline analysis indicates that a rise in education levels and in labour force participation contributes to increasing the marriage decline. On the other hand, distribution in age of women, how they are geographically distributed, and the [unequal] distribution of men and women contribute to narrowing the marriage decline...|$|E

Thesis by publication. Includes bibliographical references. 1. Introduction and scope of thesis [...] 2. Niche conservatism constrains assemblages [...] 3. Phylogenetic community structure methods [...] 4. Hakeinae: {{in and out of}} the rainforest [...] 5. Does competition matter? [...] 6. General discussion. The first theme of this dissertation explores the evolution of two iconic groups of species through Australian climate space: the Meliphagidae, or honeyeaters, which are primarily nectar-feeding birds, and the Hakeinae, a section of the plant family Proteaceae. Both groups are inferred to have had their origins in Gondwanan rainforests that were widespread across Australia 45 million years ago and then diversified into more arid environments as the continent’s climate became more arid. Accordingly, dry environments are inhabited by closely related (phylogenetically clustered) sets of species, although, in contrast to the honeyeaters, Hakeinae communities are characterized by more localized diversification. The impressive and rapid Hakeinae diversification may have been driven by specialization onto a variety of highly weathered, nutrient-poor soil types on the ancient Australian landmass. The second theme of this dissertation reviews a variety of methods to assess the phylogenetic structure of communities, such as local assemblages of honeyeaters and Hakeinae. Many published methods were found to be redundant, and some of the truly unique approaches do not measure what they purport to. Accordingly, only a small subset of phylogenetic community structure methods have merit. In the third theme of the dissertation, observations on foraging by 74 of 75 Australian honeyeater species are used to explore patterns of community assembly. Australian honeyeater communities reflect both stochastic and deterministic processes. Co-occurring species exhibit substantial overlap in foraging niche space, in contrast to assembly theory based on competition, which predicts minimal similarity among co-occurring species. At the same time, species tend to occupy <b>characteristic</b> <b>portions</b> of niche space and available niche space is smaller in the arid regions of the continent. Within this smaller available niche space, arid-zone species tend to be more widely separated in niche space than species in more mesic environments.
