5|$|Rank queries <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> using a {{modified}} version of binary search. By returning m on a successful search, and L on an unsuccessful search, the number of elements less than the target value is returned instead.|$|E
5|$|To {{diagnose}} osteochondritis dissecans, an X-ray, CT scan or MRI scan <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> to show necrosis of subchondral bone, {{formation of}} loose fragments, or both.

5|$|A player (or a pair), {{who wins}} {{at least one}} trick {{receives}} an ability to gain more round points upon declaring the card combinations. In Tute in Pairs the declarations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> {{until the end of}} round; in Two-player Tute this ability persists until only two cards are left in the deck.|$|E
5|$|For pilots, {{knowledge}} of the sky cover helps determine if visual flight rules (VFR) are being met. Knowing the degree of cloud cover can help {{determine whether or not}} various weather fronts, such as cold fronts or warm fronts, have passed by a location. A nephanalysis, contouring areas that are cloudy with scalloped lines, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> to indicate a system's cloud and precipitation pattern. This technique is rarely performed nowadays, due to the prevalence of satellite imagery worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Imaging techniques, such as x-ray, {{fluoroscopy}} and ultrasound {{are typically}} {{used to help}} guide {{the placement of the}} applicators to their correct positions and to further refine the treatment plan. CAT scans and MRI can also be used. Once the applicators are inserted, they are held in place against the skin using sutures or adhesive tape to prevent them from moving. Once the applicators are confirmed as being in the correct position, further imaging <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> to guide detailed treatment planning.|$|E

5|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{isolated}} high LDL and clinical criteria (which differ by country), genetic testing for LDL receptor mutations and ApoB mutations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed.</b> Mutations are detected in between 50 and 80% of cases; those without a mutation often have higher triglyceride levels and may in fact have other causes for their high cholesterol, such as combined hyperlipidemia due to metabolic syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Performing {{addition}} {{is one of}} {{the simplest}} numerical tasks. Addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers; the most basic task, , <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> by infants as young as five months and even some members of other animal species. In primary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day.|$|E
5|$|Predecessor and {{successor}} queries <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> with rank queries. Once {{the rank}} of the target value is known, its predecessor is the element at the position given by its rank (as {{it is the largest}} element that is smaller than the target value). Its successor is the element after it (if it is present in the array) or at the next position after the predecessor (otherwise). The nearest neighbor of the target value is either its predecessor or successor, whichever is closer.|$|E

5|$|Several {{methods for}} {{identifying}} synthetic diamonds <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed,</b> {{depending on the}} method of production {{and the color of}} the diamond. CVD diamonds can usually be identified by an orange fluorescence. D-J colored diamonds can be screened through the Swiss Gemmological Institute's Diamond Spotter. Stones in the D-Z color range can be examined through the DiamondSure UV/visible spectrometer, a tool developed by De Beers. Similarly, natural diamonds usually have minor imperfections and flaws, such as inclusions of foreign material, that are not seen in synthetic diamonds.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{is usually}} treated with urgent needle decompression. This {{may be required}} before transport to the hospital, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> by an emergency medical technician or other trained professional. The needle or cannula is left in place until a chest tube can be inserted. If tension pneumothorax leads to cardiac arrest, needle decompression is performed as part of resuscitation as it may restore cardiac output.|$|E
5|$|The above {{procedure}} only performs exact matches, {{finding the}} position of a target value. However, due to the ordered nature of sorted arrays, it is trivial to extend binary search to perform approximate matches. For example, binary search can be used to compute, for a given value, its rank (the number of smaller elements), predecessor (next-smallest element), successor (next-largest element), and nearest neighbor. Range queries seeking the number of elements between two values <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> with two rank queries.|$|E

5|$|The basic close combat from {{previous}} installments has been heavily refined and expanded into the CQC system. When unarmed or using a one-handed weapon, Snake can grab opponents {{and put them}} in a chokehold, at which point a variety of actions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed,</b> such as choking the enemy unconscious, slitting the enemy's throat, or interrogating them at knifepoint to obtain information. The context, pressure applied to the button, and movement of the analog stick determine the action performed.|$|E
5|$|The only {{physical}} {{controls on}} the lens are the AF/MF toggle switch and the two rings, controlling the zoom and focus. The lens does not have image stabilization. This is common for wide-angle photography which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> well using hand-held techniques. Over the range of focal lengths, the minimum and maximum aperture vary.|$|E
5|$|The p-adic {{numbers are}} an {{alternative}} number system {{of interest in}} number theory. Like the real numbers, the p-adic numbers can be built from the rational numbers via Cauchy sequences; the construction uses a different metric in which 0 is closer to p, and much closer to pn, {{than it is to}} 1. The p-adic numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p, including 10. So arithmetic <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> in the p-adics, and there are no infinitesimals.|$|E
