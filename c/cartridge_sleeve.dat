40|$|An {{air bearing}} {{structure}} is described that prevents destructive bending moments within the top foil. Welds are eliminated by mounting the top bearing foil in the bearing <b>cartridge</b> <b>sleeve</b> without using a space block. Tabs or pins {{at the end}} of the top bearing foil are restrained by slots or stops formed in the <b>cartridge</b> <b>sleeve.</b> These structural members are free to move in a direction normal to the shaft while being restrained from movement in the direction of shaft rotation...|$|E
5000|$|Chamber length sleeves are {{restricted}} cases where a short cartridge is {{used with a}} long parent <b>cartridge.</b> The <b>sleeve</b> is rifled {{up to the end}} of the <b>sleeve.</b> Since most <b>cartridge</b> cases are only a couple of inches long (about 5 cm) this provides limited power. On the other hand, these will function from magazines in the same way as supplemental chambers, and allow the use of the least expensive rimfire ammunition in firearms chambered in calibers larger than [...]22 (5.56 mm).|$|R
50|$|A caliber {{conversion}} sleeve or {{adapter sleeve}} is a device {{which can be}} used to non-permanently alter a firearm to allow it to fire a different cartridge than the one it was originally designed to fire. The different cartridge must be smaller in some dimensions than the original design cartridge. Alternative names sometimes imply the type of dimensional difference. A chamber insert may be used for a shorter cartridge of similar base diameter. A supplemental chamber or cartridge adapter is typically used for a shorter cartridge of reduced diameter. A <b>cartridge</b> conversion <b>sleeve</b> may include a short barrel of reduced bore diameter. Shotgun conversion sleeves may be called subgauge inserts, subgauge tubes, or gauge reducers. Sleeves intended for rifle or handgun cartridges may have rifled barrels. Additional variations may allow centerfire weapons to fire rimfire ammunition and/or retain autoloading function with the smaller cartridge.|$|R
40|$|A {{stemless}} {{ball valve}} comprising two flanges and a ball with a channel, two axis pins and two travel pins. One {{end of each}} axis and travel pin is fixedly attached to the ball, and {{the other end of}} each axis pin is lodged into a notch in the first or second flange such that the axis pin is allowed to rotate in the notch. The guide sleeve comprises two channels, and one end of each travel pin is situated within one of the two channels in the guide sleeve. An outer magnetic cartridge causes the inner magnetic <b>cartridge</b> and guide <b>sleeve</b> to rotate, and when the guide sleeve rotates, the travel pins move up and down within the channels in the guide sleeve. The movement of the travel pins within the channels in the guide sleeve causes the ball to rotate, thereby opening and closing the ball valve...|$|R
5000|$|After more {{detailed}} testing results became available, starting in 1944 the cartridge was tweaked {{in order to}} improve its accuracy and penetration. Initially, the boat tail had been omitted because the Soviet designers had assumed (incorrectly) that it would only make a difference at long ranges, when the bullet became subsonic, and the accuracy of the intermediate cartridge at these ranges was considered inconsequential. However, further testing showed that the boat tail improved accuracy even at shorter ranges, where the bullet was still supersonic. In order to maintain the overall mass of the bullet, after adding the boat tail, the ogival head section of the bullet was lengthened as well, making the bullet more streamlined overall. The maximum radius was now attained at some 15.95 mm from the tip and the overall length of the bullet increased to 26.8 mm. In order to preserve the total length of the <b>cartridge,</b> the case <b>sleeve</b> was shortened to 38.7 mm (and by rounding it is customarily referred to as 7.62×39.) Additionally, the new bullet had a core made of low-carbon steel wrapped in lead. The use of low-carbon (mild) steel was guided mostly by the desire to reuse some industrial equipment that was manufacturing the 7.62×25mm Tokarev cartridge rather than by bullet fragmentation considerations. This bullet was given the acronym [...] "7.62 PS" [...] (76.2 ПС). The [...] "S" [...] initially stood for [...] "surrogate" [...] ( [...] , [...] ), but later the letter was taken to refer to the steel component ( [...] , [...] ) of the core, which accounted for about 50% of the core volume. The 7.62×39 cartridge equipped with the PS bullet finally overcame all objections of the GAU in mid-1947, when it was ordered into series production, and given the index 57-N-231S.|$|R
