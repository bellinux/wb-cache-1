40|$|Corrosion {{performance}} of zinc-nickel and zinc-cobalt alloys prepared as duplex and triplex layers {{were evaluated by}} the potentiodynamic polarisation method and a simulated salt spray test. The results were compared with those obtained in the field test under severe tropical marine conditions. The effect of a nickel undercoat was also evaluated. All tests were conducted with electroplated deposits with and without <b>chromate</b> <b>passivation.</b> The results indicate that their corrosion resistance was in the orderof Nil Zn-Co/Zn-Ni>Ni/Zn-Ni/Zn-Co>Zn-Co/Zn-Ni>Zn-Ni/Zn-Co>Ni/Ni-Zn>Ni/Zn-Co. However, in marine testing Ni/Zn-Co/Zn-Ni showed tendency to crack formatio...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{feasibility}} {{was investigated}} to substitute chrome-free passivation treatment of electrodeposited zinc in a titanium bath for <b>chromate</b> <b>passivation</b> treatment. The formation {{mechanism of the}} chrome-free passivation film was further analyzed. The surface morphologies and the elemental compositions of the treated samples with varied immersion times were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and determined by energy dispersion spectrometry (EDS), respectively. The electrode potential of the sample surface was recorded in the film formation process. The changes of the electrode potential are in accordance with that of SEM and EDS of the sample surface. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) show the chrome-free passivation film composed of ZnO, SiO 2, TiO 2, Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2, and SrF 2. The anode zinc dissolution and the local pH value increase due to the cathode hydrogen ion reduction process result {{in the formation of}} the chrome-free passivation film. The macro-images of the chrome-free passivation films formed on electrodeposited zinc show that the color of the film changes from blue to iridescence with the increase of the immersion times...|$|E
40|$|<b>Chromate</b> {{replacement}} in <b>passivation</b> processes {{has formed}} the basis of much research, molybdates having already been studied as one entirely chromium free alternative. Molybdate conversion coatings from three different solutions have been examined using the scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) to determine whether molybdates are capable of 'self-repair', one of the beneficial features of chromates. Additionally, morphological studies and neutral salt spray corrosion tests have been used to characterise the samples. Chromate passivated samples have been used as the standard against which the molybdates have been assessed throughout the study. SVET line scans conducted over a period of âˆ¼ 74 min suggest that molybdates are capable of some form of self-repair when damaged. However, the anodic potential perturbation during repassivation is larger than that observed with chromates. </p...|$|R
40|$|From industrialized baths, free of cyanide, the {{corrosion}} {{behavior of}} electrodeposits of zinc and zinc alloys was studied {{by means of}} electrochemical tests in aerated solution of 3. 5 % (0. 6 M) NaCl at pH 8. 2. In literature, several studies are found about zinc coatings and zinc alloys, for example, Zn-Ni and Zn-Co, nevertheless there is little about the ternary alloy Zn-Fe-Co. The Fe presence in the alloy results in a good adhesion to the substrate and allows application of these materials at higher temperatures. The electrochemical tests were carried out by obtaining open circuit potential curves with immersion time, potentiodynamic polarization curves and cyclic voltammetry. From the obtained results, the large potential differences observed between the steel and the electrodeposits showed that the last protect the substrate, acting as a sacrifice metal. The tests disclosed similar behaviors in both the current densities and the corrosion potential for electrodeposits of Zn and Zn-Fe-Co. After <b>chromate</b> <b>passivation</b> process, {{a significant decrease in}} corrosion density was noted for Zn and when the system was de-aerated there was change in the cathodic process mechanism...|$|E
