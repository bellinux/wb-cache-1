25|$|The abdomen has no {{appendages}} except {{from one}} to four (usually three) modified pairs of movable telescoping organs called spinnerets, which produce silk. Originally, the common ancestor of spiders had four pairs of spinnerets, with two pairs on the tenth body segment and two pairs on the eleventh body segment, located in the middle on the ventral side of the abdomen. The suborder Mesothelae is unique in having only two types of silk glands – {{thought to be the}} ancestral condition. All other spiders have the spinnerets further towards the posterior end of the body where they form a small cluster, and the anterior central spinnerets on the tenth segment are lost or reduced (suborder Mygalomorphae), or modified into a specialised and flattened plate called the cribellum (suborder Araneomorphae). The cribellum (usually separated into a left and a right half) produces a thread made up of hundreds to thousands of very fine dry silk fibers (about 10nm thick) around a few thicker <b>core</b> <b>fibers,</b> which then are combed into a woolly structure by using a group of specialized hairs (setae) on their fourth pair of legs. It is suspected their woolly silk is charged with static electricity, causing its fine fibres to attach to trapped prey. Once all araneomorph (modern) spiders had a cribellum, but today it only remains in the cribellate spiders (although it is sometimes missing even here), which are widespread around the world. Often, this plate lacks the ability to produce silk, and is then called the colulus; an organ that zoologists have not identified a function for. The colulus is reduced or absent in most species. The cribellate spiders were the first spiders to build specialized prey catching webs, later evolving into groups that used the spinnerets solely to make webs, instead using silk threads dotted with droplets of a sticky liquid (like pearls on a necklace) to capture small arthropods, and a few large species even small bats and birds. Other spiders do not build webs at all, but have become active hunters, like the highly successful jumping spiders.|$|E

5000|$|Intrinsic defects {{are present}} in the matrix of a single {{component}} glass material like pure silica. These include per-oxy linkages, POL (≡Si-O-O-Si≡) which are oxygen interstitials, and oxygen deficient centers, ODC (≡Si-Si≡) which are oxygen vacancies. [...] When exposed to ionizing radiation, these sites trap holes to form per-oxy radicals, POR (≡Si-O-O.) and E’ centers (≡Si.), respectively. In addition, rapidly cooled silica has strained ≡Si-O-Si≡ bonds, which are cleaved upon radiation to form non-bridging oxygen hole centers (NBOHC) depicted as ≡Si-O. and E’ centers by trapping holes and electrons, respectively. [...] When the glass contains a second network former with the same valence as silicon such as germanium, the difference in the electronegativities favors the dopant as a hole trap. Hence greater radiation damage occurs in doped silica glass. To improve radiation resistance of pure silica <b>core</b> <b>fibers,</b> it is necessary to minimize the number density of these intrinsic defects. Minimization of defects is achieved not only by reducing the incorporation of impurities in glass but also by controlling the input gas composition, optimizing the thermal history of glass at all stages of fiber manufacturing and optimizing the stress in the fiber core. Other strategies include incorporation of dopants (such as fluorine) in the core that minimize formation of defect centers discussed above.|$|E

Since the core and cladding do not collapse, two taper regions exist, one in the core {{and the other in}} the cladding. The cladding taper does not affect the light transmission, only the core is reduced to a microtaper. The spectral response of the microtaper based-suspended <b>core</b> <b>fiber</b> is similar to a beat of two interferometers.
