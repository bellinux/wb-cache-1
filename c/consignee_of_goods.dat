5000|$|The Bill of Lading designates that {{a carrier}} shall assume all risk of loss, damage, delay and {{liability}} in the transportation of any goods for shippers {{from the time}} of carrier's receipt of such goods and from a shipper until proper delivery has been made. Carriers are responsible for full actual loss. If the <b>consignee</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> finds the freight damaged or unacceptable the bill of lading also serves as a legal instrument to dispute the delivery of goods in accordance to the provisions of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations Section 1005, Section 14706 (the Carmack Amendment), [...] and applicable state law to rectify any losses that happened due to the carrier.|$|E
50|$|Customs {{authorities}} {{may require}} cargo-carrying vessels or vehicles {{to provide information}} on the cargo manifest such as its consignor, <b>consignee,</b> quantity <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> origin, destination and value.|$|R
5000|$|The Uniform Bills of Lading Act {{was adopted}} in 1909 and {{passed by the}} US Uniform Law Commission. The act {{addressed}} the judicial and legislative treatment of {{issues such as the}} extent of the carrier's liability to the <b>consignee</b> <b>of</b> the <b>goods</b> or to the buyer of the bill of lading based upon the carrier's issuance of the bill. [...] It governed the relationship between persons with interest in the goods, and carriers who transported those goods. It set described how a carrier could limit its liability.|$|R
5000|$|The law <b>of</b> {{carriage}} <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> by sea {{is a body}} of {{law that}} governs the rights and duties of shippers, carriers and <b>consignees</b> <b>of</b> marine cargo. [...] It is an aspect of international commercial law and of maritime law.|$|R

50|$|In the {{carriage}} <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> by sea, air or land, goods may be lost, damaged or deteriorated. The {{bill of lading}} (transport document used almost exclusively for carriage <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> by sea) is a contract of carriage between the consignor, the carrier and consignee {{that acts as a}} receipt <b>of</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and as a negotiable instrument. The bill of lading also determines rights and liabilities agreed between parties to an international sale contract. Also reservations as to the quality and quantity <b>of</b> the <b>goods</b> are marked on the bill when accepting goods so as to stifle any accusations from the <b>consignee</b> <b>of</b> damage in transit. The consignor retains ownership <b>of</b> the <b>goods</b> until the bill of lading is transferred to the <b>consignee.</b> Most bills <b>of</b> lading today are governed by international conventions such as the Hague Rules (International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading); Hague-Visby Rules, which is a revised version of the Hague Rules by a Brussels Protocol in 1968; and Hamburg Rules. These rules impose minimum responsibilities and liabilities that cannot be softened by contract. On the other hand, the United States and the United Kingdom adopted the Carriage <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> by Sea Act (COGSA).|$|R
50|$|A {{consignor}} who consigns {{goods to}} a consignee transfers only possession, not ownership, <b>of</b> the <b>goods</b> to the consignee. The consignor retains {{title to the}} goods. The <b>consignee</b> takes possession <b>of</b> the <b>goods</b> subject to a trust. If the consignee converts the goods to a use not contemplated in the consignment agreement, such as by selling them and keeping the {{proceeds of the sale}} for the <b>consignee,</b> the crime <b>of</b> embezzlement has been committed.|$|R

50|$|After {{a recall}} is issued, FSIS conducts {{effectiveness}} checks {{to ensure that}} the company’s customers (or consignees) have received notice of the recall and are making every effort to retrieve and destroy the recalled product or return it to the recalling firm. FSIS personnel verify that the recalling firm has been diligent and successful in notifying and advising their <b>consignees</b> <b>of</b> the need to retrieve and control recalled product, and that the consignees have responded accordingly. FSIS has formal agreements with many state governments that allow those states to participate in effectiveness checks, thus improving the speed and effectiveness of recalls.|$|R
50|$|Dewey's {{ships were}} {{scattered}} {{up and down}} the Asiatic coast; {{but by the end of}} March the whole squadron, except the antiquated wooden Monocacy, had been gathered in the port of Hong Kong, their coal and stores replenished.

First he sent the fleet paymaster over to the <b>consignees</b> <b>of</b> the English steamship Nanshan, and bought her as she was, with 3,300 tons of coal on board. Then he bought Zafiro, a steamship of the Manila-Hong Kong line, just as she was, with all her fuel and provisions, and on her was placed all the spare ammunition, so that she became the magazine of the fleet.|$|R

5000|$|Golden Fleece was a 968-ton clipper. It was wrecked on April 22, 1854, {{as it was}} exiting Golden Gate on {{a voyage}} way to Manilla. The wreck {{occurred}} at the rocks near Fort Point. The Daily Alta California wrote that [...] "lying broadside OR to the rocks... bilged and full of water, her mainmast is gone, also the fore and main top mast". On April 22, 1854, the wreck was sold in a public auction and [...] "The purchasers of the wreck are busily engaged stripping her of everything moveable, {{at the same time}} preparations are being made to raise her...

50|$|Irla {{gradually}} {{made his}} way into the world of business and politics. With his brothers, he began industrial and commercial activities from Sant Feliu de Guíxols. He created the company Josep Irla & Co. using the capital of the three brothers. From this base, they opened a factory of cork stoppers that was extended over the years. They were <b>consignees</b> <b>of</b> boats and owned a schooner, with which they traded in wine and cork with Barcelona, acting as customs agents.In 1902, Irla married Florence Bas and Parent, also of Sant Feliu de Guixols and descendant of a family of workers.

5000|$|A waybill (UIC) is a {{document}} issued by a carrier giving details and instructions {{relating to the}} shipment of a consignment <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> Typically it will show {{the names of the}} consignor and <b>consignee,</b> the point <b>of</b> origin of the consignment, its destination, and route. Most freight forwarders and trucking companies use an in-house waybill called a house bill. These typically contain [...] "conditions of contract of carriage" [...] terms {{on the back of the}} form.

40|$|This work {{analyzes}} {{the use of}} the train by the Galician companies when they do business transactions with northern Portuguese operators. The residual usage of this infrastructure (0. 01 of all the transactions) is proved opposite the masive use of the truck; factors that explain the choice and the possible truck-versus-train replacement are established. The statistical study includes representative industrial companies and the main <b>consignees</b> <b>of</b> regular lines in the port of Vigo as spectrum. A formative explained structural equation model and a linear regression of the modal choice and its effect on the referred replacement are suggested. As conclusion, the need of improvement of the infrastructures in the connection mentioned above is assessed by companies and logistic operators (these last ones are more interested in changing) although the real liberalization of the rail operators market is a priority as without this, the improvement mentioned above would not affect the modal choice significantly...|$|R
5000|$|Azgapet is {{a leader}} of a tribe or clan in ancient and medieval Armenia, similar to chieftain. The term {{originates}} from the words azg (Armenian: ազգ), which means extended family or clan, and pet, which means chief. [...] The term azgapet {{had been used in}} addition to other similar terms for tribal collectivities, such as tanuter (Armenian: տանուտեր) and nahapet (Armenian: նահապետ). Patriarch Hayk, the legendary and eponymous progenitor of the Armenian people, is sometimes referred to as azgapet. One prominent medieval work where Armenian azgapets were mentioned include The History of the Province of Aghvank by Movses Kaghankatvatsi. The author of the “History..” mentions several dignitaries, including azgapets, who signed the Constitution of Aghven, a 5th-century legal document commissioned by King Vachagan II the Pious of Aghvank. One family with origins in the village of Syghnakh in the Nagorno Karabakh Republic claims descent from azgapet Marut, a chieftain from Varanda Valley and a <b>consignee</b> <b>of</b> the Constitution.|$|R

The trial took place on board the Asia, 74, a flag-ship; but {{we lived in the}} Ramilies, during the time the investigation was going on. Sir Thomas Hardy held several conversations with me, on the quarter-deck, in which he manifested great kindness of feeling. He inquired whether I was really an American; but I evaded any direct answer. I told him, however, that I had been an apprentice, in New York, in the employment of Jacob Barker; which was true, in one sense, as Mr. Barker was the <b>consignee</b> <b>of</b> the Sterling, and knew of my indentures. I mentioned him, as a person more likely to be known than Captain Johnston. Sir Thomas said he had some knowledge of Mr. Barker; and, I think, I have heard that they were, in some way, connected. This was laying an anchor to-windward, as it turned out, in the end.|$|R
2500|$|In 1873, the Peruvian {{government}} {{dictated the}} Ley del estanco del salitre, which limited the salitre production and authorized {{the government to}} purchase the whole production to a fixed price. But the plan failed and the law was withdrawn. In 1875, Peru's government expropriated the salitreras of Tarapacá {{in order to secure}} revenue from guano and nitrate by means of a monopoly, and in 1876 Antony Gibbs & Sons became <b>consignee</b> <b>of</b> the nitrate trade for the Peruvian government. President Mariano Ignacio Prado was [...] "determined to complete the monopoly" [...] and in 1876 Peru bought the nitrate licenses for [...] "El Toco" [...] auctioned by Bolivian decree of 13 January 1876. But the Chilean CSFA remained the most serious competitor and clearly weakened Peru's monopoly. President Pardo, Prado's predecessor, had urged Gibbs to secure the monopoly by limiting CSFA's output, and in fact, Henry Gibbs had warned the CSFA's directory board, in a letter on 16 April 1878, that CSFA's refusal to limit the output would bring administrative trouble with Peru and Bolivia as long and as intensive as it is made more and more to the interest of a neighboring Government that they should be so.|$|R

50|$|Waybills are {{non-negotiable}} documents unlike {{bills of}} lading which are negotiable. The words non-negotiable are printed clearly {{at the top}} of the air waybill. This means that the air waybill is a contract for transportation only and does not represent (the value of) merchandise mentioned in the box nature and quantity <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> The ocean bill of lading, if negotiated, may represent (the value <b>of)</b> the <b>goods</b> and must be endorsed by the party ultimately accepting the goods.Although the AWB is a non-negotiable document, it can be used as a means of payment. This can be done only through the intermediary of a bank and only when the carriage is subject to a letter of credit. The air waybill executed according to the terms of a letter of credit allows the shipper to present the original of the air waybill to the bank and collect the billed value <b>of</b> the shipped <b>goods</b> from the bank. The amount paid by the bank to the shipper will be debited to the consignee who ordered the goods.
