40|$|This {{in vitro}} study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} a <b>resin</b> <b>coating</b> on the microleakage of Class V restorations due to bleaching. One-hundred and sixty Class V cavities were randomly restored with one of four different restorative materials (n = 40) : a compomer (Dyract AP), a conventional glass-ionomer cement (Ketac Molar Easymix), a resin modified glass-ionomer cement (Fuji II LC) and a resin composite (Filtek Z 350). For each kind of material, 40 restorations were divided into four subgroups: bleached with <b>resin</b> <b>coating</b> (group BC), bleached without <b>resin</b> <b>coating</b> (group B), immersed in artificial saliva with <b>resin</b> <b>coating</b> (group SC), immersed in artificial saliva without <b>resin</b> <b>coating</b> (group S). In groups B and BC, the specimens were bleached with 10 % carbamide peroxide gel for eight hours daily, while groups SC and S were stored in artificial saliva instead. After 28 -day treatment, all the samples were subjected to a dye penetration test using the multiple-sectioning technique. In addition, one more test was performed to investigate the color difference between the coated and uncoated tooth surface after bleaching. There was a statistically significant increase in cervical microleakage in the group B specimens of Fuji II LC and Ketac Molar Easymix compared to their respective control specimen (group S). These effects on microleakage were not found in the bleached specimens with <b>resin</b> <b>coating</b> (group BC). There was also no visually-detectable color difference between the coated and uncoated tooth surface.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} a <b>resin</b> <b>coating</b> technique on dentin tensile bond strengths of dual-cured resin cements. METHODS: 10 bovine dentin specimens were tested for tensile bond strengths of each of the following four materials: Panavia F, Link Max, Bistite II, Rely-X. Bovine dentin ground with 600 -grit SiC was bonded with a resin cement according to the manufacturers' instructions or the <b>resin</b> <b>coating</b> technique, which was used in combination with one coat of a dentin adhesive; Clearfil SE Bond, Unifil Bond, One-Up Bond F or Single Bond, with one coat of a low viscosity micro-filled resin, Protect Liner-F. Each dentin adhesive and the low viscosity micro-filled resin were cured for 10 seconds and 20 seconds respectively. After 1 day storage in water, the specimens were subjected to the tensile bond test at a crosshead speed of 2 mm/minute. The data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Fisher's PLSD test (P 0. 05). Regarding the fracture modes, complete and partial adhesive failures were observed in the cases without <b>resin</b> <b>coating.</b> For the <b>resin</b> <b>coating</b> groups, the fracture modes were much more complicated, although, adhesive failures rarely occurred.

5000|$|In the US, {{dimethyl}} carbonate was exempted under {{the definition of}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by the U.S. EPA in 2009. [...] Due to its classification as VOC exempt, {{dimethyl carbonate}} has grown in popularity and applications {{as a replacement for}} methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), tert-butyl acetate, and parachlorobenzotrifluoride. Dimethyl carbonate has an ester- or alcohol-like odor, which is more favorable to users than most hydrocarbon solvents it replaces. Dimethyl carbonate has an evaporation rate of 3.22 (butyl acetate = 1.0), which slightly slower than MEK (3.8) and ethyl acetate (4.1), and faster than toluene (2.0) and isopropanol (1.7). Dimethyl carbonate has solubility profile similar to common glycol ethers, meaning dimethyl carbonate can dissolve most common <b>coating</b> <b>resins</b> except perhaps rubber based resins. Hildebrand solubility parameter is 20.3 Mpa and Hansen solubility parameters are: dispersion = 15.5, polar = 3.9, H bonding = 9.7. [...] Dimethyl carbonate is partially soluble in water up to 13%, however it is hydrolyzed in water-based systems over time to methanol and CO2 unless properly buffered.Dimethyl carbonate can freeze at same temperatures as water, it can be thawed out with no loss of properties to itself or coatings based on dimethyl carbonate.|$|E

By controlling the concentration of UV-curable polymeric resin with mixing the volatile solvent and its airbrushing time, the <b>coated</b> <b>resin</b> film thickness can be readily tuned. After R 2 R NIL using a flexible nanoscale line pattern (nanograting) mold is conducted upon the airbrushed resin film, a large-area uniform nanograting pattern is fabricated with controlled residual layer thickness (RLT) based on the initial film thickness. We investigate the faithful airbrushing condition that can reliably create the uniform thin films as well as various nanopatterns with controlled morphologies. Using more diluted resin and shorter airbrushing time can reduce the RLTs favourably for many applications, yet is apt to induce the nanoscale pores and discontinued lines. We also discuss how to further improve the quality and scalability of resin airbrushing and its potential applications particularly requiring high-speed and conformal coating on highly topographic and flexible surfaces.|$|R
