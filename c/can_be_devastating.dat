5|$|Epizootics are {{outbreaks}} (epidemics) {{of disease}} among non-human animals. During the 20th century significant epizootics of viral diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest of cattle, avian and swine influenza, swine fever and bluetongue of sheep. Viral diseases of livestock <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> both to farmers {{and the wider}} community, as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001 showed.|$|E
25|$|A {{symptomatic}} treatment includes rehydration and pain relief with {{drugs such as}} paracetamol (acetaminophen in the United States). Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) should not be given because of its anticoagulant effect, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> {{in the case of}} internal bleeding that can occur with yellow fever.|$|E
25|$|Measles is an endemic disease, {{meaning that}} it has been {{continually}} present in a community, and many people develop resistance. In populations that have not been exposed to measles, exposure to a new disease <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastating.</b> In 1529, a measles outbreak in Cuba killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox. The disease had ravaged Mexico, Central America, and the Inca civilization.|$|E

50|$|Its native host plants {{include the}} desert lime (Citrus glauca), the Australian finger lime (Citrus australasica), and Correas. It {{has become a}} major pest of {{cultivated}} citrus crops, where it sucks the fluid from new growth and young fruit, causing them to turn yellow and drop off. Whole crops <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastated.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{short-term}} psychological {{injuries to}} the victims include feelings of fear, helplessness, sadness, disorientation, isolation, vulnerability, and desperation. If left untreated, the psychological effects of sexual assault and rape <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastating,</b> sometimes even deadly. Causes of death {{as the result of}} sexual violence include suicide and murder. Murder of sexual assault and rape victims may be perpetrated by the rapist or as part of an honor killing by family members of the victim.|$|E
25|$|Because {{they provide}} 30 {{molecules}} of ATP per glucose molecule {{in contrast to}} the 2 ATP molecules produced by glycolysis, mitochondria are essential to all higher organisms for sustaining life. The mitochondrial diseases are genetic disorders carried in mitochondrial DNA, or nuclear DNA coding for mitochondrial components. Slight problems with any one of the numerous enzymes used by the mitochondria <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> to the cell, and in turn, to the organism.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{cultural}} implications {{and the importance of}} bearing children, infertility in Ghana <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastating.</b> Throughout the years, Ghanaians have believed that both physical and spiritual ailments are the cause of infertility. Some people believe that a womb could be too hot or too cold to support a developing baby. Others believe that the cause of their infertility is witchcraft, and this belief is often supported by traditional priests who assert that the woman can be rid of a witch's curse and be allowed to conceive if the priest performs a rite in which he asks fertility gods how they can be appeased. Other spiritual beliefs involving infertility include the belief that infertility {{is the result of a}} woman's disobedience to God, in which the remedy is prayer and repentance. Women who consult a tradition birth attendant are likely to be told that prayer is the medicine for infertility, although they acknowledge that infertility is sometimes caused by a physical ailment. In these cases, the traditional birth attendant may blame the infertility on stomach aches and advise the woman to visit a hospital and take the medicine given by the doctor.|$|E
50|$|All rusts are obligate parasites, {{meaning that}} they require a living host to {{complete}} their life cycle. They generally do not kill the host plant but can severely reduce growth and yield. Cereal crops <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastated</b> in one season and trees that get infected in the main stem within their first five years by the rust Cronartium quercuum often die.|$|R
50|$|Protection of African {{elephants}} is {{a high-profile}} conservation cause in many countries. In 1989, the Kenyan Wildlife Service burned a stockpile of tusks in {{protest against the}} ivory trade. However, African elephant populations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastated</b> by poaching despite nominal governmental protection, and some nations permit the hunting of elephants for sport. In 2012, The New York Times reported a large upsurge in ivory poaching, with about 70% of the product flowing to China.|$|R

25|$|Reverse swing {{tends to}} be {{stronger}} than normal swing, and to occur late in the ball's trajectory. This gives it a very different character from normal swing, and because batsmen experience it less often, they generally find {{it much more difficult}} to defend against. It is also possible for a ball to swing normally in its early flight, and then to alter its swing as it approaches the batsman. This can be done in two ways one for the ball to reverse its direction of swing, giving it an 'S' trajectory: the other is for it to adopt a more pronounced swing in the same direction in which the swing is already curving; either alteration <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> for the batsman. In the first instance, he is already committed to playing the swing one way, which will be the wrong way to address swing which is suddenly coming from the opposite direction: in the second instance, his stance will be one which is appropriate for the degree, or extent, of the expected swing, and which could suddenly leave him vulnerable to LBW, being caught behind, or bowled. Two consecutive deliveries from Wasim Akram, one of each type, were considered to be the turning point of the 1992 World Cup Final.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{aspect of}} cultural capital that sometimes {{comes into play}} in immigrant families is familiarity with American laws. Parents may find that U.S. law is in conflict with their traditional means of disciplining their children. While parents may be accustomed to certain parental rights in their home country, these rights may not be protected in American society. There may be cases in which outside agents—either school officials, police officers, or government officials—become involved in conflicts between parents and children. This is particularly true in cases of alleged physical abuse. Children, who may be more familiar with American laws, can use this knowledge to gain assistance from individuals outside of the family. The involvement of outside agents may tip the traditional power balance within the family and affords family members who are {{more familiar with the}} rules and norms of the United States a certain degree of power over family members who are not as familiar with these laws. Among immigrants who come from cultures with strict hierarchies based on age, such interventions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> to parents who may feel that their authority has been undermined. Family members who are better assimilated into American culture are more able, and probably more likely, to utilize their knowledge of American laws to change the dynamics of family relations. This generates inequality based on degree of assimilation since those who are less assimilated are more likely to lose face {{as the result of the}} penetration of such laws into the traditionally private domain of the family.|$|E
500|$|Droughts are {{an annual}} summer concern in Minnesota, {{especially}} for farmers. [...] The growing season (which varies from 90 {{days per year}} in the Iron Range to 160 days in southeast Minnesota) is when Minnesota averages its highest percentage of annual precipitation, so a lack of rainfall during this time period <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> to crops. [...] The last major drought in Minnesota was in 1988. [...] During that year, the period of April–July was the 2nd driest in the previous century, and the period of May–August was the hottest on record. [...] The combination of dry skies and heat caused a severe drought which cost the state approximately 1.2billion dollars in crop losses.|$|E

500|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{can produce}} extremely powerful winds and torrential rain, {{as well as}} high waves and damaging storm surge. They develop over large bodies of warm water, and lose their strength if they move over land. This is the reason coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone, while inland regions are relatively safe from the strong winds. Heavy rains, however, can produce significant flooding inland, and storm surges can produce extensive coastal flooding up to [...] from the coastline. Although their effects on human populations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>devastating,</b> tropical cyclones can also relieve drought conditions.

500|$|While {{tropical}} cyclones {{can produce}} extremely powerful winds and torrential rain, {{they are also}} able to produce high waves and a damaging storm surge. Their winds increase the wave size, {{and in so doing}} they draw more heat and moisture into their system, thereby increasing their strength. They develop over large bodies of warm water, and hence lose their strength if they move over land. This is the reason coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone, while inland regions are relatively safe from strong winds. Heavy rains, however, can produce significant flooding inland. Storm surges are rises in sea level caused by the reduced pressure of the core that in effect [...] "sucks" [...] the water upward and from winds that in effect [...] "pile" [...] the water up.
