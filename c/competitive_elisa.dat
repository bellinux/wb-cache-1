5000|$|Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is an assay that {{utilizes}} {{the principle}} of antibody-antigen recognition to test {{for the presence of}} certain substances. The three main types of ELISA tests which are indirect ELISA, sandwich ELISA, and <b>competitive</b> <b>ELISA</b> all rely on the fact that antibodies have an affinity for only one specific antigen. Furthermore, these antigens or antibodies can be attached to enzymes which can react to create a colorimetric result indicating the presence of the antibody or antigen of interest. [...] Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays are used most commonly as diagnostic tests to detect HIV antibodies in blood samples to test for HIV, human chorionic gonadotropin molecules in urine to indicate pregnancy, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis antibodies in blood to test patients for tuberculosis. Furthermore, ELISA is also widely used as a toxicology screen to test people's serum for the presence of illegal drugs.|$|E

The indirect <b>competitive</b> <b>ELISA</b> employed chicken anti-melittin IgY. The biotinylated DAS-ELISA employed anti-melittin monoclonal antibody (MAb) and biotinylated anti-melittin IgY. To produce anti-melittin IgY; Sigma melittin was emulsified with Freund‘s incomplete adjuvant and immunised to Leghorn laying chickens intramuscularly at four different sites (50 μg/mL, 0. 25 mL per site) of the breast muscles. After 5 to 8 weeks of the immunisation, anti-melittin IgY was extracted and analysed by ELISA. The anti-melittin IgY antibody produced was highly specific to melittin and did not cross-react with other bee venom proteins, as examined by ELISA and a western-blot assay. Indirect <b>competitive</b> <b>ELISA</b> demonstrated a higher range of melittin detection (2. 5 to 80 μg/mL). Double antibody sandwich ELISA using MAb as the capture antibody and biotinylated polyclonal IgY as the detection antibody, provided a lower range of detection (2. 5 - 40 ng/mL), which has a 1000 times higher sensitivity than that of indirect <b>competitive</b> <b>ELISA.</b> Therefore, indirect <b>competitive</b> <b>ELISA</b> is a useful tool to measure the concentration of melittin in bee venom as a raw material.

40|$|A <b>competitive</b> <b>ELISA</b> {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the measurement of}} total antibodies to the capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b (HibCPS) in human sera. The competitive method showed an excellent correlation to the radioantigen binding assay (RABA, or Farr assay) and improved correlation of sera with low titers {{with respect to the}} more conventional noncompetitive method. Overestimation of samples in the low concentration range was no longer observed with the <b>competitive</b> <b>ELISA</b> method. The free HibCPS competition allowed us to eliminate the day-to-day background variation typical of some sera; thus, only values representing the true anti-HibCPS response were determined. The use of precoated microplates, which could be stored up to 8 months, greatly improved the speed of the procedure. An overall correlation coefficient of 0. 9660 was found when 407 serum samples {{with a wide variety of}} anti-HibCPS antibody levels were tested with the <b>competitive</b> <b>ELISA</b> and RABA.

40|$|Immunological assays {{demonstrate}} that buckwheat flour proteins present no toxic prolamins to coeliac patients. Our study proves that buckwheat has no homologous protein structure with wheat. Electrophoretograms showed that some protein bands of buckwheat proteins resemble papillionaceous (bean) proteins. The allergenic character of buckwheat {{was measured by}} <b>competitive</b> indirect <b>ELISA</b> using anti-wheat germ lectin (Wga) immune serum. Properly hulled buckwheat flour did not react with Wga immune serum, and is therefore suitable {{to be used in}} the diet of coeliac patients. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody for microcystin–leucine–arginine (MC-LR) {{was produced by}} cell fusion. The immunogen was synthesized in two steps. First, ovalbumin/ bovine serum albumin was conjugated with 6 -acetylthiohexanoic acid using a carbodiimide EDC (1 -ethyl- 3 -[3 -dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride) / NHS (N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide) reaction. After dialysis, the protein was reacted with MC-LR based on a free radical reaction under basic solution conditions. The protein conjugate was used for immunization based on low volume. The antibodies were identified by indirect <b>competitive</b> (ic) <b>ELISA</b> and were subjected to tap water and lake water analysis. The concentration causing 50 % inhibition of binding of MC-LR (IC 50) by the <b>competitive</b> indirect <b>ELISA</b> was 0. 27 ng/mL. Cross-reactivity to the MC-RR, MC-YR and MC-WR was good. The tap water and lake water matrices {{had no effect on}} the detection limit. The analytical recovery of MC-LR in the water samples in the icELISA was 94 %– 110 %. Based on this antibody, an immunochromatographic biosensor was developed with a cut-off value of 1 ng/mL, which could satisfy the requirement of the World Health Organization for MC-LR detection in drinking water. This biosensor could be therefore be used as a fast screening tool in the field detection of MC-LR...|$|R
