These are most useful where the design requirement is not too stringent, that is, moderate bandwidth, roll-off and passband ripple.|$|E

5|$|In the lowcountry {{region of}} coastal Georgia and South Carolina, the Carolina Marsh Tacky {{was the most}} common horse for most of the breed's history. As the {{automobile}} became more common during the 20th century, breed numbers declined, and the Marsh Tacky was thought to have gone extinct during the 1980s and 1990s. Today there are 276 living animals recognized by the breed registry, including 153 mares and 123 stallions and geldings. The Equus Survival Trust <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> breed to be at critical/nearly extinct levels, meaning that there are fewer than 100 breeding mares in existence. The American Livestock Breeds Conservancy <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> Marsh Tacky (which they consider a strain of the Colonial Spanish horse) to be at critical levels, meaning that there are fewer than 200 annual registrations in the United States and an estimated global population of less than 2,000. Representatives of the ALBC state that the breed numbers will have to increase to an estimated 1,000 members to ensure permanent survival. On June 11, 2010, a bill was signed into law that made the Carolina Marsh Tacky the state heritage horse of South Carolina.|$|E

By some reports, one eagle was presented to Washington, though whether it was from this first coinage is uncertain.|$|E
