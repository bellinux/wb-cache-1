50|$|A toddler can trasition from a bottle/breast to a cup {{at about}} 18 {{months of age}} or even sooner. They benefit most from a gradual {{transition}} rather than abruptly withholding bottles.

Toddlers often don't prefer cow's milk over breast milk or formula. Mixing the cow's milk with breastmilk or formula {{can be done with}} the end result of the toddler receiving all cow's milk. Milk intake for toddlers can be reduced when protein from other sources is added to the diet.|$|R
