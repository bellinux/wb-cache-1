5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular <b>combustor.</b> An annular <b>combustor</b> is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each combustion chamber is separate, and canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).|$|E
5|$|The J79 engines {{produced}} noticeable {{amounts of}} black smoke (at mid-throttle/cruise settings), a severe disadvantage in that the enemy could spot the aircraft. This was solved on the F-4S fitted with the −10A engine variant which used a smokeless <b>combustor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{are due to}} its 61-inch {{titanium}} wide chord fan, 3D aerodynamics designed new {{core and}} low-pressure turbine with single crystal high-pressure turbine and Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). Fan blades are reduced from 38 to 24 and it incorporates features from the CFM56-5 series such as a double-annular <b>combustor</b> as an option.|$|E
25|$|In most applications, {{multiple}} cans {{are arranged}} around the central {{axis of the}} engine, and their shared exhaust is fed to the turbine(s). Can type <b>combustors</b> were most widely used in early gas turbine engines, owing to their ease of design and testing (one can test a single can, rather than have to test the whole system). Can type <b>combustors</b> are easy to maintain, as only a single can needs to be removed, rather than the whole combustion section. Most modern gas turbine engines (particularly for aircraft applications) do not use can <b>combustors,</b> as they often weigh more than alternatives. Additionally, the pressure drop across the can is generally higher than other <b>combustors</b> (on the order of 7%). Most modern engines that use can <b>combustors</b> are turboshafts featuring centrifugal compressors.|$|R

5|$|The CFM56-5A {{series is}} the initial CFM56-5 series, {{designed}} {{to power the}} short-to-medium range Airbus A320 family. Derived from the CFM56-2 and CFM56-3 families, the -5A series produces thrusts between 22,000 and 26,500lbf (98kN and 118kN). Aerodynamic improvements such as an updated fan, low-pressure compressor, high-pressure compressor and <b>combustor</b> make this variant 10–11% more fuel efficient than its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|An {{improvement}} of the CFM56-5A series, it was originally designed to power the A321. With a thrust range between 22,000 and 33,000lbf (98kN and 147kN) it can power every model in the A320 family (A318/A319/A320/A321) and has superseded the CFM56-5A series. Among the changes from the CFM56-5A is the option of a double-annular <b>combustor</b> that reduces emissions (particularly NOx), a new fan in a longer fan case, and a new low-pressure compressor with a fourth stage (up from three in earlier variants). It is the most numerous engine supplied to Airbus.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56-2 {{series is}} the {{original}} variant of the CFM56. It is most widely used in military applications where it {{is known as the}} F108; specifically in the KC-135, the E-6 Mercury and some E-3 Sentry aircraft. The CFM56-2 comprises a single-stage fan with 44 blades, with a three-stage LP compressor driven by a four-stage LP turbine, and a nine-stage HP compressor driven by a single-stage HP turbine. The <b>combustor</b> is annular.|$|E
40|$|Combustion {{oscillations}} are {{a common}} problem in development of LPM (lean premix) <b>combustors.</b> Unlike earlier, diffusion style <b>combustors,</b> LPM <b>combustors</b> are especially susceptible to oscillations because acoustic losses are smaller and operation near lean blowoff produces a greater combustion response to disturbances in reactant supply, mixing, etc. In ongoing tests at METC, five instability mechanisms {{have been identified in}} subscale and commercial scale nozzle tests. Changes to fuel nozzle geometry showed {{that it is possible to}} stabilize combustion by altering the timing of the feedback between acoustic waves and the variation in heat release...|$|R

This status report focuses on the current operation of fluidized bed <b>combustors.</b> <b>Combustors</b> have been installed in the following industrial sectors: pulp and paper, biomass heat and power plants, waste-to-energy plants, and communal sewage sludge treatment plants. There are also some small demonstration plants. These plants all have in common that they treat renewable fuel types. In many cases, only bio-fuels are treated. Besides the ability to burn a wide range of low-grade and difficult fuels, fluidized bed <b>combustors</b> have the advantages of low NOX emissions and the possibility of in-process capture of SO 2.

5|$|The work {{split between}} the two {{companies}} gave GE responsibility for the high-pressure compressor (HPC), the <b>combustor,</b> and the high-pressure turbine (HPT); SNECMA {{was responsible for the}} fan, the low-pressure compressor (LPC), and the low-pressure turbine (LPT). SNECMA was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving the nacelle design, and was initially responsible for the gearbox, but shifted that work to GE when it became apparent that it would be more efficient for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 is a {{high-bypass}} {{turbofan engine}} (most {{of the air}} accelerated by the fan bypasses {{the core of the}} engine and is exhausted out of the fan case) with several variants having bypass ratios ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000lbf (80kN to 150kN) of thrust. The variants share a common design, but the details differ. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning that there are two rotating shafts, one high-pressure and one low-pressure. Each is powered by its own turbine section (the high-pressure and low-pressure turbines, respectively). The fan and booster (low-pressure compressor) evolved over the different iterations of the engine, as did the compressor, <b>combustor</b> and turbine sections.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{recorded}} incidents of CFM56 engines flaming out in heavy rain and/or hail conditions, beginning {{early in the}} CFM56's career. In 1987, a double flameout occurred in hail conditions (the pilots managed to relight the engines), followed by the TACA Flight 110 incident in 1988. Both CFM56 engines on the TACA 737 flamed out while passing through hail and heavy rain, and the crew was forced to land without engines on a grassy levee near New Orleans, Louisiana. CFMI modified the engines by adding a sensor to force the <b>combustor</b> to continuously ignite under these conditions.|$|E

25|$|A <b>combustor</b> is a {{component}} or {{area of a}} gas turbine, ramjet, or scramjet engine where combustion takes place. It {{is also known as}} a burner, combustion chamber or flame holder. In a gas turbine engine, the <b>combustor</b> or combustion chamber is fed high pressure air by the compression system. The <b>combustor</b> then heats this air at constant pressure. After heating, air passes from the <b>combustor</b> through the nozzle guide vanes to the turbine. In the case of a ramjet or scramjet engines, the air is directly fed to the nozzle.|$|E
25|$|Ramjet engines {{differ in}} many ways from {{traditional}} gas turbine engines, {{but most of the}} same principles hold. One major difference is the lack of rotating machinery (a turbine) after the <b>combustor.</b> The <b>combustor</b> exhaust is directly fed to a nozzle. This allows ramjet combustors to burn at a higher temperature. Another difference is that many ramjet combustors do not use liners like gas turbine combustors do. Furthermore, some ramjet combustors are dump combustors rather than a more conventional type. Dump combustors inject fuel and rely on recirculation generated by a large change in area in the <b>combustor</b> (rather than swirlers in many gas turbine combustors). That said, many ramjet combustors are also similar to traditional gas turbine combustors, such as the <b>combustor</b> in the ramjet used by the RIM-8 Talos missile, which used a can-type <b>combustor.</b>|$|E

These emitted dinitrogen oxide with 70 kt/a, however, 20 % of the entire N 2 O amounts from stationary firing plants.

25|$|A <b>combustor</b> {{must contain}} and {{maintain}} stable combustion despite very high air flow rates. To do so combustors are carefully designed to first mix and ignite {{the air and}} fuel, and then mix in more air to complete the combustion process. Early gas turbine engines used a single chamber known as a can type <b>combustor.</b> Today three main configurations exist: can, annular and cannular (also referred to as can-annular tubo-annular). Afterburners are often considered another type of <b>combustor.</b>|$|E
25|$|Uniform exit {{temperature}} profile. If {{there are}} hot {{spots in the}} exit flow, the turbine may be subjected to thermal stress or other types of damage. Similarly, the temperature profile within the <b>combustor</b> should avoid hot spots, as those can damage or destroy a <b>combustor</b> from the inside.|$|E
25|$|Scramjet (supersonic {{combustion}} ramjet) engines {{present a}} much different situation for the <b>combustor</b> than conventional gas turbine engines (scramjets are not gas turbines, they generally have few or no moving parts). While scramjet combustors may be physically quite different from conventional combustors, they face {{many of the same}} design challenges, like fuel mixing and flame holding. However, as its name implies, a scramjet <b>combustor</b> must address these challenges in a supersonic flow environment. For example, for a scramjet flying at Mach 5, the air flow entering the <b>combustor</b> would nominally be Mach 2. One of the major challenges in a scramjet engine is preventing shock waves generated by <b>combustor</b> from traveling upstream into the inlet. If that were to happen, the engine may unstart, resulting in loss of thrust, amongst other problems. To prevent this, scramjet engines tend to have an isolator section (see image) immediately ahead of the combustion zone.|$|E

These trends are further discussed as effects significant to the turbojet engine, such as altitude operational limits, specific fuel consumption, thrust, acceleration, and turbine life...|$|R
25|$|Advancements in <b>combustor</b> {{technology}} {{focused on}} several distinct areas; emissions, operating range, and durability. Early jet engines produced {{large amounts of}} smoke, so early <b>combustor</b> advances, in the 1950s, were aimed at reducing the smoke produced by the engine. Once smoke was essentially eliminated, efforts turned in the 1970s to reducing other emissions, like unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide (for more details, see the Emissions section below). The 1970s also saw improvement in <b>combustor</b> durability, as new manufacturing methods improved liner (see Components below) lifetime by nearly 100 times that of early liners. In the 1980s combustors began to improve their efficiency across the whole operating range; combustors tended to be highly efficient (99%+) at full power, but that efficiency dropped off at lower settings. Development over that decade improved efficiencies at lower levels. The 1990s and 2000s saw a renewed focus on reducing emissions, particularly nitrogen oxides. <b>Combustor</b> technology is still being actively researched and advanced, and much modern research focuses on improving the same aspects.|$|E
25|$|The flame ({{combustion}}) {{must be held}} (contained) {{inside of}} the <b>combustor.</b> If combustion happens further back in the engine, the turbine stages can easily be overheated and damaged. Additionally, as turbine blades continue to grow more advanced {{and are able to}} withstand higher temperatures, the combustors are being designed to burn at higher temperatures and the parts of the <b>combustor</b> need to be designed to withstand those higher temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The case is {{the outer}} shell of the <b>combustor,</b> and is a fairly simple structure. The casing {{generally}} requires little maintenance. The case is protected from thermal loads by the air flowing in it, so thermal performance is of limited concern. However, the casing serves as a pressure vessel that must withstand {{the difference between the}} high pressures inside the <b>combustor</b> and the lower pressure outside. That mechanical (rather than thermal) load is a driving design factor in the case.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that flame generated sound is the origin of combustion instabilities in swirl <b>combustors</b> featuring lean premixed flames. Understanding of aeroacoustics in swirl <b>combustors</b> can help understand better the control/suppression of these combustion instabilities. Large eddy simulation (LES) featuring high-order numerics and non-reflecting boundary conditions has been developed to study aeroacoustics of swirl <b>combustors.</b> The code has been validated for three different cases. LES results {{were found to be}} in reasonable agreement with the available experimental data. An important objective of this study was also to assess the accuracy of hybrid approach to predict aeroacoustics of swirl <b>combustors.</b> Ffocws Williams-Hawkings (FWH) equation gives poor predictions for far-field sound in swirl <b>combustors.</b> The poor predictions of FWH are due to the strong convection effects in the far-field region of swirl <b>combustors</b> which are not accounted in this equation. Linearized Euler equations (LEE) which account for the convection effects were considered. LEE predictions of far-field sound were validated using the directly computed sound from LES. LEE predictions of far-field sound are found to be in reasonable agreement with LES results. Additional noise in the high frequency region is observed in LEE which is {{due to the lack of}} viscous effects in this set of equations. ^ A major road block in the efficiency of high speed hydraulic devices is the formation of cavitation. A better understanding of cavitation and its control is necessary for higher efficiency of these hydraulic devices. The LES code was modified to study cavitating flow in a venturi-type geometry. Flow acceleration due to area contraction and recirculation due to area expansion are qualitatively captured. Local vorticity is intensified by the vapor in cavitating regions. Dilatation and baroclinic torque terms are identically zero for the non-cavitating flows, however are non-zero for cavitating flows with dilatation term being about two orders of magnitude larger than the baroclinic torque term. ...|$|R

New analysis tools using probability density functions are introduced which enable exact expressions for the statistics of a time delayed system. Additionally, preexisting tools from applied mathematics and control theory for spectral analysis of time delay systems are introduced to the combustion community. These new analysis tools {{can be used to}} extend sensitivity function analysis used in control theory to explain limits to control effectiveness in self-excited <b>combustors.</b> The control effectiveness of self-excited <b>combustors</b> with actuator constraints are found to be most sensitive to the location of non-minimum phase zeros. Modeling the non-minimum phase zeros correctly require accurate volumetric heat release perturbation models. Designs that removes non-minimum phase zeros {{are more likely to have}} poles in the right hand complex plane.
