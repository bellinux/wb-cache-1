40|$|Research PaperFisher {{behavior}} {{can be divided into}} choices made in the short term (i. e. tactics) and choices made in the long-mid term (i. e. strategies). Random utility <b>modeling</b> (<b>RUM)</b> is well suited for the empirical analysis of these issues. In this paper, RUM is applied to a number of EU fisheries in order to assess the key factors affecting short-term discrete choices with regard to choice of fishing location in European fisheries. In the analyses presented, components of the choice relating to gear, species targeted and the fishing area/ground selected are explored. Four differently structured case studies are considered to develop the discussion: Basque trawlers, English beam trawlers, French trawlers and Danish gillnetters. In the case of the Basque trawlers, a multinomial logit formulation proved suitable to analyze the fishing area (including gear used and target species). For the English beam trawl fleet and French trawlers conditional logit is used, and for the Danish gillnetters a nested logit formulation is developed. Specific attention is given to the identification of explanatory variables incorporated in these analyses. Overall results show that short term behavior <b>models</b> (<b>RUM)</b> are highly capable of predicting the spatial effort distribution of fishing fleets...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores {{extensions}} of Random Utility <b>Models</b> (<b>RUMs),</b> providing more flexible models and adopting a computational perspective. This includes building new models and understanding their properties such as identifiability and the log concavity of their likelihood functions {{as well as}} the development of estimation algorithms. A special case of RUMs that has received significant attention is the Luce model, for which there are fast inference methods for maximum likelihood estimation. This thesis introduces RUMs including those with exponential family utility distributions, mixture of RUMs, and non-parametric RUMs. Fast inference is achieved through the Monte-Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MC-EM) algorithm. Results on both real-world and simulated data provide support for the ability of these models to better capture heterogeneity in data and for scalable model estimation.

Using a Monte Carlo experiment, I investigate the viability of function transfer when behavioral parameters {{are assumed to be}} equal but differences in scale exist for the policy and study regions.

Our main technique is breaking, that is, we first break full rankings {{in the data}} to pairwise comparisons. We apply a generalized method of moments (GMM) algorithm to compute the parameters. This approach of breaking and then applying GMM often provides a significant computational advantage, and with the right breakings, retains statistical consistency.
