40|$|The {{relations}} between the personality trait of neuroticism and mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>processing</b> are reviewed. Major experimental findings {{in this area are}} described and used to evaluate a number of different cognitive theories of neuroticism, including spreading-activation, self-schema and fragmentation models. The empirical findings centre on the observation of idiosyncratic patterns <b>of</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> emotional stimuli {{as a function of the}} level of neuroticism. These idiosyncracies are similar to those which have been observed to occur as a function of depressed mood, and it is suggested that they may be of relevance to the development and maintenance of clinical depression and other emotional disorders. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the <b>cognitive</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> negative self-related information is generally facilitated among high N scorers and that, in appropriate circumstances, this tendency can lead to episodes of clinical depression. © 1985...|$|R

40|$|The human {{stress hormone}} {{cortisol}} may facilitate effective coping after psychological stress. In apparent agreement, administration of cortisol {{has been demonstrated}} to reduce fear in response to stressors. For anxious patients with phobias or posttraumatic stress disorder this has been ascribed to hypothetical inhibition of retrieval of traumatic memories. However, such stress-protective effects may also work via adaptive regulation <b>of</b> early <b>cognitive</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> threatening information from the environment. This paper selectively reviews the available literature on effects of single cortisol administrations on affect and early <b>cognitive</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> affectively significant information. The concluded working hypothesis is that immediate effects of high concentration of cortisol may facilitate stress-coping via inhibition <b>of</b> automatic <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> goal-irrelevant threatening information and through increased automatic approach avoidance responses in early emotional processing. Limitations in the existing literature and suggestions for future directions are briefly discussed...|$|R

Our main result demonstrated noticeable differences between the age groups and between smoking experiences in the <b>cognitive</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> tobacco warnings. Our experimental paradigm represents an important step in identifying the mechanisms through which certain types of written warnings are cognitively processed, which in turn may well set a critical base for understanding decision makers’ responses to risky behaviors such as smoking and for constructing adequate health warnings...|$|R

30|$|Overall, {{the current}} study could not {{directly}} relate FN and P 3 amplitudes to most measures of affective and cortical asymmetry, and suggests that these components predominantly represent basic performance monitoring cognitive processes. Information regarding the differences {{between high and low}} expectancy suggest that affective states and traits and baseline asymmetry may predispose differences in <b>cognitive</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> loss-related feedback. The P 3 showed sensitivity to participant win expectancy, and showed some relationships to trait anxiety and appetitive motivation measures, but these were more pronounced for low win expectancy. Individual differences in error-related processing were revealed in the differences in P 3 processing between the two conditions, such that trait anxiety, state negative affect, and baseline cortical asymmetry predicted differences in the <b>cognitive</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> loss-related feedback. This suggests that while the overall amplitudes of the components reflect cognitive processes, affective states seem to predispose some participants to process loss-related feedback equivalently, regardless of whether they perceived the losses as occurring while guessing or occurring after the establishment of a learned pattern of response.|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} has identified {{a variety of}} factors that influence <b>cognitive</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> artifact concepts, but few experiments tested possible interactive patterns among these factors. Using a natural language depiction based free naming task, we explored how an object’s function and its history (information about how an object was formed by natural force) interact to affect categorization judgment in a 2 × 2 between- subjects experiment (N = 169). The study had two key findings: (i) Without presenting an object’s function, presenting the history of its natural formation increased subjects’ tendency to name the object under the “natural” domain and decreased their tendency to name it under the “artifact” domain; (ii) once we presented the depiction of an object’s function,the effect of history presentation on categorization disappeared: Subjects in both conditions strongly preferred naming objects as artifacts. In summary, presenting depiction of an object’s function inhibited the effect of history on object categorization. Current findings suggest that an object’s function plays a fundamental role in the <b>cognitive</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> artifact concepts...|$|R

Ninety-six 5 -year-old children viewed a videotaped segment of Sesame Street followed by a comprehension test and a recognition test. Equal numbers of subjects viewed an experimental segment in which (a) the audio and video tracks were from the same segment (A/V match), (b) the audio and video tracks were not from the same segment (A/V mismatch), (c) the video track was presented alone, or (d) the audio track was presented alone. This design allows unconfounded comparisons <b>of</b> modality-specific <b>processing.</b> In the A/V mismatch condition, memory for audio information was reduced more than memory for video information. However, comprehension and recognition of audio information was similar in the audio-only and A/V match conditions.

40|$|Stories {{can play}} a crucial role in {{conveying}} health information to audiences. Several theories have been used to describe <b>cognitive</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> narratives and subsequent belief change; yet there have been no comparative studies to date examining these theories. A primary objective was to compare transportation, flow, and AIME. A secondary objective of this study was to examine previous experience with a health issue as a possible moderator between exposure to entertainment television narratives and subsequent belief change. This is important to examine because previous experience may predispose audience members to have more durable attitudes. A pre-test/post-test experimental design was used to test theories <b>of</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> narrative entertainment television programs with three different health topics: binge drinking, problem-eating behavior, and unprotected sexual intercourse. Stimuli were drawn from one-hour, broadcast television programming. Measures of the theories, health related beliefs, and previous experience with the three health issues were assessed. Findings revealed that different constructs represented in the three theories were significant predictors of belief change. Results showed that while most individual constructs of theories predicted belief change, the theories were not interchangeable. An analysis of the extent to which participants reported <b>cognitive</b> <b>processing</b> according to each theory revealed more flow and AIME experienced in comparison to transportation. Reports of flow and AIME were equal in a third condition. More globally, all three theories accounted for a significant portion of belief change, but no differentiation was evidenced between the theories in their ability to predict belief change. In analyses of the effects of exposure to television narratives, belief change was significant in all three treatment conditions. Previous experience with a health issue did not impede belief change following exposure to television narratives. This lends support to theorizing about <b>cognitive</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> narratives in that previous experience with an issue may enhance story-consistent beliefs. Overall, findings demonstrate that a more fruitful endeavor in future research on the persuasive impact of narratives is to devote attention to the underlying constructs of theories, rather than assuming cognitive processes are the same among theories...|$|R
