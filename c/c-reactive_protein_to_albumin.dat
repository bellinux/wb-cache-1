30|$|Inflammation {{has been}} {{reported}} {{to play an important role}} in cancer progression and various inflammatory markers have been reported to be useful prognostic markers. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the significance of the <b>C-reactive</b> <b>protein</b> <b>to</b> <b>albumin</b> (CRP/ALB) ratio in colorectal cancer patients who received palliative chemotherapy. We performed a retrospective review of 99 patients who underwent palliative chemotherapy for unresectable colorectal cancer between 2005 and 2010. The cutoff value of the CRP/ALB ratio was determined based on a receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. The relationship between the CRP/ALB ratio and survival was assessed. The cutoff value for the CRP/ALB ratio was 0.183. The high pretreatment CRP/ALB ratio group showed significantly worse overall survival. Patients with a high pretreatment CRP/ALB ratio and in whom the CRP/ALB ratio normalized after chemotherapy tended to have better overall survival than those in whom both the pretreatment and posttreatment CRP/ALB ratios were high. The CRP/ALB ratio is a useful marker for predicting survival and monitoring chemotherapeutic effectiveness in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.|$|E
40|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} (AC) {{has been}} reported to improve the prognosis for patients with Stage III colorectal cancer (CRC).

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the predictive value of the CAR for side effects of AC in CRC. A total of 136 CRC patients who received AC were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were subdivided into two groups by the CAR level (CAR ≥ 0. 1, n = 30; CD < 0. 1, n = 106). The presence of lymphatic invasion, severe side effects, and discontinuation of AC were associated with high CAR levels (p = 0. 02, < 0. 01, and 0. 02; respectively). High levels of the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) appeared to be associated with the CAR (p = 0. 04, p< 0. 01; respectively). Multivariate analysis identified CAR≥ 0. 1 (HR: 7. 06, 95 % CI: 2. 51 - 19. 88, p< 0. 01) as a significant determinant of severe side effects of AC.

We examined the predictive value of this ratio in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). In this cross-sectional study, 91 eligible adult HD patients were analyzed, and the correlation between the CRP-Alb ratio and skeletal muscle mass normalized for body weight (SMM/wt; estimated using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer) was investigated. The mean age of the study participants was 54. 9 ± 6. 6 years (ranging from 27 to 64 years); 43 (47. 2 %) were men. The mean values for the SMM/wt were 39. 1 % ± 5. 4 %. The CRP-Alb ratio was found to be negatively correlated with SMM/wt (r = - 0. 33, P = 0. 002) and creatinine (r = - 0. 20, P = 0. 056).

A total of 216 osteosarcoma patients {{were enrolled in the}} study. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses between the groups were performed and Kaplan–Meier analysis was conducted to plot the survival curves. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated and areas under the curve (AUCs) were compared to assess the discriminatory ability of the inflammation-based indicators, including CRP/Alb ratio, Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet–lymphocyte ratio (PLR). The optimal cutoff value was 0. 210 for CRP/Alb ratio with a Youden index of 0. 319. Higher values of CRP/Alb ratio were significantly associated with poorer overall survival in univariate (HR = 2. 62, 95 % CI = 1. 70 – 4. 03; P< 0. 001) and multivariate (HR = 2. 21, 95 % CI = 1. 40 – 3. 49; P= 0. 001) analyses.

The prognostic significance of several inflammatory indicators, including neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet–lymphocyte ratio (PLR), Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), <b>C-reactive</b> <b>protein</b> <b>to</b> <b>albumin</b> ratio (CRP/Alb ratio), lymphocyte–monocyte ratio (LMR), and neutrophil–platelet score (NPS), {{were found to}} be correlated with prognosis in several cancers. However, the prognostic role of these inflammatory biomarkers in Ewing sarcoma has not been evaluated. This study enrolled 122 Ewing patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was generated to determine optimal cutoff values; areas under the curves (AUCs) were assessed to show the discriminatory ability of the biomarkers; Kaplan–Meier analysis was conducted to plot the survival curves; and Cox multivariate survival analysis was performed to identify independent prognostic factors. The optimal cutoff values of CRP/Alb ratio, NLR, PLR, and LMR were 0. 225, 2. 38, 131, and 4. 41, respectively. CRP/Alb ratio had a significantly larger AUC than NLR, PLR, LMR, and NPS. Higher levels of CRP/Alb ratio (hazard ratio [HR] 2. 41, P= 0. 005), GPS (HR 2. 27, P= 0. 006), NLR (HR 2. 07, P= 0. 013), and PLR (HR 1. 85, P= 0. 032) were significantly correlated with poor prognosis. As the biomarkers had internal correlations, only the CRP/Alb ratio was involved in the multivariate Cox analysis and remained an independent prognostic indicator. The study demonstrated that CRP/Alb ratio, GPS, and NLR were effective prognostic indicators for patients with Ewing sarcoma, and the CRP/Alb ratio was the most robust prognostic indicator with a discriminatory ability superior to that of the other indicators; however, PLR, LMR, and NPS may not be suitable as prognostic indicators in Ewing sarcoma.

We describe {{the cases of}} two children with uncomplicated renal transplantation who had false-positive sCRP values on analyzers using rabbit anti-CRP but values within the reference range with anti-CRP from other animal species. Cross-reaction with heterophilic antibodies was suggested by clinical and biological signs of serum sickness and daily treat-ment with rabbit antilymphocyte globulin (ALG). The interference depended on the serum concentration o...|$|R

Lowgrade inflammation is characteristic of metabolic syndrome. <b>C-reactive</b> <b>protein,</b> the best characterized biomarker of inflammation, is also an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events. This review outlines the role of highsensitivity <b>C-reactive</b> <b>protein</b> in contributing <b>to</b> increased cardiovascular risk in metabolic syndrome by inducing endothelial cell dysfunction and activating monocytes...|$|R
