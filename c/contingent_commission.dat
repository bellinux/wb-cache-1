40|$|Many {{insurers}} pay independent agencies a <b>contingent</b> <b>commission</b> {{based on}} the agency’s performance. The insurer must accrue funds during the year to recognize the expected <b>contingent</b> <b>commission</b> payout in the financial statements. Westfield Insurance wanted to reduce their accrual forecasting error from 20 percent to less than five percent. We built a Monte Carlo simulation to simulate each Westfield agency’s performance. We clustered agencies into representative groups {{as a proxy for}} generating correlated ran-dom variables and then designed an experiment to shift statistical distributions of agency key performance indicators. The results of the simulation were then used to derive a formula for forecasting expected con-tingent commissions based on overall company results. The approach, results, and areas for further re-search are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Current Version: 7 - 6 - 07 The New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer’s {{civil suit}} against the mega-broker Marsh & McLennan Cos, on October 14, 2004, for “bid-rigging ” and {{inappropriate}} use of “contingent commissions ” has {{raised questions about the}} judiciousness of <b>contingent</b> <b>commission</b> as a compensation mechanism and has brought to the forefront the need to design a new regulatory structure to address the shortcomings of the insurance regulatory system. We test the market reaction to the civil action suit by applying the event study methodology, within a GARCH framework, to insurance brokers and property-liability and life-health-accident insurers. The findings are fourfold. First, ARCH/GARCH effects are significant for both the sectoral portfolios and about half of individual brokers and property-liability insurers. Second, the event generated negative effects both within the brokerage sector and for individual brokerage firms, suggesting that the contagion effect dominates the competitive effect. Third, the inter-sectoral information spillover effects across the brokerage, property-liability, and life-health sub-sectors of the insurance industry are also significant and mostly negative. Fourth, our results support the information-based hypothesis against the pure-panic contagion effect as the size of the impact due to the event is highly correlated with firm characteristics...|$|E

40|$|In November 2004, New York 2 ̆ 7 s {{prominent}} Attorney General (and now Governor) Eliot Spitzer accused {{insurance broker}} Marsh 2 ̆ 6 McLennan of defrauding its clients by accepting 2 ̆ 2 <b>contingent</b> <b>commissions.</b> 2 ̆ 2 <b>Contingent</b> <b>commissions</b> are bonuses that insurers pay to brokers and independent agents (collectively 2 ̆ 2 independent intermediaries 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 producers 2 ̆ 2) {{for bringing the}} insurer a particularly large volume of profitable customers. Since Spitzer 2 ̆ 7 s initial attack on <b>contingent</b> <b>commissions,</b> his office has parlayed similar accusations into six settlement agreements with major insurance industry companies, twenty guilty pleas from these companies 2 ̆ 7 executives and officers, and approximately 3 billion in restitution and penalties. According to the latest count, more than twenty states have opened their own investigations into misconduct in the insurance industry. And seven states, with more expected to follow, have passed legislation to combat the types of practices Spitzer uncovered. Federal officials have monitored these responses closely, with some suggesting that they expose fundamental problems with lodging insurance regulation at the state-rather than federal-level. In short, {{during the last two}} years <b>contingent</b> <b>commissions</b> have caused a scandal unparalleled {{in the history of the}} property-casualty insurance industry...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{studies on}} errors in reserve {{estimation}} suggest that insurers manage loss reserves to achieve corporate goals, including tax minimisation and income smoothing. Analysing U. S. {{property and casualty}} insurance industry data, we find a relationship between reserve errors and the purchase of reinsurance. A relationship is also found between reserve errors and the payment of <b>contingent</b> <b>commissions.</b> Since reserve errors may be costly in both instances, insurers who purchase reinsurance and those who pay <b>contingent</b> <b>commissions</b> may have a greater incentive to reserve accurately than other insurers. We find that in these cases insurers report smaller over-reserving errors...|$|R
5000|$|Spitzer {{asserted}} that <b>contingent</b> <b>commissions</b> {{contributed to a}} widespread practice of [...] "bid-rigging" [...] where brokers solicited fake bids with deliberately less favorable terms for the consumer than the bid offered by the insurance company paying the highest commissions.|$|R
40|$|Insurers {{operate in}} a complex and {{competitive}} market in which several thousand firms compete for business from millions of consumers with diverse needs. Over time, {{a wide array of}} producers, marketing systems, and compensation systems have evolved to satisfy these needs. Recent concerns about the potential for improper alignment of incentives in the sales process have led to questions about some of the traditional compensation practices used in the insurance marketplace. This paper examines the role of insurance producers and compensation in the insurance industry. <b>Contingent</b> <b>commissions,</b> paid by the insurer to an agency that has satisfied profitability and, in many cases, retention and growth requirements, are part of the overall compensation system that has developed in the insurance industry. <b>Contingent</b> <b>commissions</b> have been criticized as being harmful to insurance buyers and as compromising the process by which insurance is placed with insurers. We find that <b>contingent</b> <b>commissions</b> are not inherently bad for consumers (i. e., policyholders) and, in fact, can help to align the incentives of the insurer with the agent. Properly structured contingent compensation arrangements seek to reward the intermediary for various activities, including: 1) bringing accuratelypriced, properly underwritten business to the insurer; 2) assisting the insurer in retaining existing business; 3) promoting the growth goals of the insurer; and 4) managing the losses on business place...|$|R
50|$|In 2004 New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer {{conducted}} an {{investigation in the}} insurance industry.

Additionally, the investigation examined whether Travelers had created the illusion of competition by submitting fake bids, thus misleading clients into believing they were receiving competitive commercial premiums.|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the economic functions of independent insurance in-termediaries (brokers and independent agents), {{focusing on the}} commercial property–casualty insurance market. The article investigates the functions performed by intermediaries, the competitiveness of the market, the com-pensation arrangements for intermediaries, and {{the process by which}} poli-cies are placed with insurers. Insurance intermediaries are essentially mar-ket makers who match the insurance needs of policyholders with insurers who have the capability of meeting those needs. Intermediary compensa-tion comprises premium-based commissions, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} premium paid, and <b>contingent</b> <b>commissions</b> based on the profitability, persistency, and/or volume of the business placed with the insurer. Empir-ical evidence is provided that premium-based and <b>contingent</b> <b>commissions</b> are passed on to policyholders in the premium. However, contingent com-missions can enhance competitive bidding by aligning the insurer’s and the intermediary’s interests. This alignment of interests gives insurers more con-fidence in the selection of risks and thus helps to break the “winner’s curse” and encourages insurers to bid more aggressively. Independent intermedi-aries also help markets operate more efficiently by reducing the information asymmetries between insurers and buyers that can cause adverse selection...|$|R
50|$|In 2004-2005, Aon, {{along with}} other brokers {{including}} Marsh & McLennan and Willis, fell under regulatory investigation under New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and other state attorneys general.

In the spring of 2005, without acknowledging any wrongdoing, Aon agreed to a $190 million settlement, payable over 30 months.|$|R

Effects {{on the stock}} returns of insurance brokers and insurers are tested. The findings are: (1) GARCH effects are significant in modeling broker/insurer returns; (2) the suit generated negative effects on the brokerage industry and individual brokers, suggesting that contagion dominates competitive effects; (3) spillover effects from the brokerage sector to insurance business are significant and mostly negative, demonstrating industry integration; and (4) information-based contagion is supported, {{as opposed to the}} pure-panic contagion.

40|$|How do markets {{spread risk}} when events are unknown or unknowable and where not {{anticipated}} in an insurance contract? While the policyholder can "hold up" the insurer for extra contractual payments, the continuing gains from trade {{on a single}} contract are often too small to yield useful coverage. By acting as a repository of the reputations of the parties, we show the brokers provide a coordinating mechanism to leverage the collective hold up power of policyholders. This extends both the degree of implicit and explicit coverage. The role {{is reflected in the}} terms of broker engagement, specifically in the ownership by the broker of the renewal rights. Finally, we argue that brokers can be motivated to play this role when they receive <b>commissions</b> that are <b>contingent</b> on insurer profits.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the role of}} independent insurance intermediaries in markets where matching is important. A controversial matter in the discussion concerning insurance intermediation {{is the issue of}} compensation customs and how the latter affect prices, rents and advice quality in insurance markets. This work compares a fee-based with a commission-based system. We show that in a situation with a non-strategic intermediary both remuneration systems are payoff-equivalent. In a second step, allowing for strategic behavior, we discuss the impact of remuneration on the quality of advice. The analysis shows that the possibility of mismatching can provide the intermediary with substantial market power which however does not translate into mismatching as long as consumers have rational expectations.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays examining issues in insurance capital structure, distribution and market power. ^ The first essay consists of a review of capital structure swaps literature. A new model is developed for capital structure swaps for insurance companies under asymmetric information and/or comparative advantage. Model validity is demonstrated by comparing announcement period stock market returns and long-run profitability for insurance companies that issue equity and increase reinsurance in the same year. Evidence of value creation resulting from swaps shows that insurance company managers {{may be able to}} expropriate wealth from reinsurers and new equity investors when the reinsurance markets price loss reserves differently from primary insurers. ^ The second essay includes examination of industry-level market valuation effects of attorney general litigation activity. If an attorney general lawsuit announcement against a subset of firms that threatens other firms in the industry (either with punitive sanctions or changes in, regulatory enforcement), the industry portfolio may also experience adverse valuation effects. Furthermore, the firm-level effect {{may be related to the}} intensity of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s use of the threatened technology. There was an industry-wide negative stock market reaction to New York State Attorney General Elliot Spitzer 2 ̆ 7 s lawsuit against select insurance carriers. Furthermore, firm-level valuation losses are related to the intensity of contingent use. These market value losses suggest that investors believed that <b>contingent</b> <b>commissions</b> were a value-enhancing tool for insurance carriers. Market valuation effects were concentrated about the lawsuit announcement, suggesting the investors did not believe that the public investigation contained credible information about future changes in regulatory enforcement. ^ The third essay examines increasing concentration in the health insurance industry, determining whether such concentration increases are pro-competitive or anti-competitive. This study develops theory related to market structure and profitability, and examines health insurance mergers since 1998. The impact of mergers on rivals 2 ̆ 7 stock market returns is estimated using event study methodology, and suggests that mergers are not believed to be either pro- or anti-competitive, but rather, rival returns suggest the presence of a signaling effect. ...|$|R

50|$|The BVRC {{formed a}} company-sized contingent, Captain Richard Tucker and 88 other ranks, in December 1914, which trained {{over the winter}} and spring before being sent to England in June, 1915. As there was a {{shortage}} of officers, the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, Lieutenant-General Sir George Bullock, filled the role of Adjutant, a position normally filled by a Captain. As a consequence, the contingent was popularly known as Bullock's Boys. It had been intended for the contingent to join the 2 Lincolns, but that battalion was already in France when they arrived and it became an extra company of 1 Lincolns, instead, deployed to the Western Front in July. It had lost {{more than half of}} its strength by September, 1916, and could no longer compose a rifle company.
