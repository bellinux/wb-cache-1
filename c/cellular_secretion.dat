25|$|The {{release of}} a {{neurotransmitter}} is triggered {{by the arrival of}} a nerve impulse (or action potential) and occurs through an unusually rapid process of <b>cellular</b> <b>secretion</b> (exocytosis). Within the presynaptic nerve terminal, vesicles containing neurotransmitter are localized near the synaptic membrane. The arriving action potential produces an influx of calcium ions through voltage-dependent, calcium-selective ion channels at the down stroke of the action potential (tail current). Calcium ions then bind to synaptotagmin proteins found within the membranes of the synaptic vesicles, allowing the vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. The fusion of a vesicle is a stochastic process, leading to frequent failure of synaptic transmission at the very small synapses that are typical for the central nervous system. Large chemical synapses (e.g. the neuromuscular junction), on the other hand, have a synaptic release probability of 1. Vesicle fusion is driven by the action of a set of proteins in the presynaptic terminal known as SNAREs. As a whole, the protein complex or structure that mediates the docking and fusion of presynaptic vesicles is called the active zone. The membrane added by the fusion process is later retrieved by endocytosis and recycled for the formation of fresh neurotransmitter-filled vesicles.|$|E

In healthy humans, plasma PCSK9 levels directly correlate with plasma sortilin levels, following a diurnal rhythm similar to cholesterol synthesis. Interestingly, the plasma PCSK9 concentration is higher in women compared to men, and the PCSK9 concentrations decrease with age in men but increasein women, suggesting that estrogen level most likely plays a role. PCSK9 gene expression can be regulated by sterol-response element binding proteins (SREBP-1/2), which also controls LDLR expression.|$|E

Next we apply the technique to determine concentration of secreted antibodies from 9 E 10 hybridoma cells as detected using nanoplasmonic biosensors.

40|$|Abstract Background Our {{previous}} {{report that the}} Norwalk virus nonstructural protein p 22 is an antagonist of the cellular secretory pathway suggests a new aspect of norovirus/host interaction. To explore conservation of function of this highly divergent calicivirus protein, we {{examined the effects of}} p 22 homologues from four human and two murine noroviruses, and feline calicivirus on the secretory pathway. Findings All human noroviruses examined induced Golgi disruption and inhibited protein secretion, with the genogroup II. 4 Houston virus being the most potent antagonist. Genogroup II. 6 viruses have a conserved mutation in the mimic of an Endoplasmic Reticulum export signal (MERES) motif that is highly conserved in human norovirus homologues of p 22 and is critical for secretory pathway antagonism, and these viruses had reduced levels of Golgi disruption and inhibition of protein secretion. p 22 homologues from both persistent and nonpersistent strains of murine norovirus induced Golgi disruption, but only mildly inhibited <b>cellular</b> protein <b>secretion.</b> Feline calicivirus p 30 did not induce Golgi disruption or inhibit <b>cellular</b> protein <b>secretion.</b> Conclusions These differences confirm a norovirus-specific effect on host cell secretory pathway antagonism by homologues of p 22, which may affect viral replication and/or cellular pathogenesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Monitoring {{cytokine}} release by cells {{allows the}} investigation of cellular response to specific external stimuli, such as pathogens or candidate drugs. Unlike conventional colorimetric techniques, label-free detection of cytokines enables studying <b>cellular</b> <b>secretions</b> in real time by eliminating additional wash and labeling steps after the binding step. However, label-free techniques {{that are based on}} measuring mass accumulation on a sensor surface are challenging for measuring small cytokines binding to much larger capture agents (usually antibodies) because the relative signal change is small. This problem is exacerbated when the capturing antibodies desorb from the surface, a phenomenon that almost inevitably occurs in immunoassays but is rarely accounted for. Here, we demonstrate a quantitative dynamic detection of interleukine- 6 (IL- 6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, using an interferometric reflectance imaging sensor (IRIS). We improved the accuracy of the quantitative analysis of this relatively small protein (21 kDa) by characterizing the antibody desorption rate and compensating for the antibody loss during the binding experiment. By correcting for protein desorption, we achieved an analytical limit of detection at 19 ng/mL IL- 6 concentration. We enhanced the sensitivity by 7 -fold by using detection antibodies that recognize...|$|R
40|$|Agents {{that act}} as anion channel {{blockers}} (ACBs) and do not permeate cells appear to inhibit exocytosis in platelets, parathyroid cells, and neutrophils. Based {{in large part on}} these observations, anion influx through plasma membrane channels has been considered a factor controlling <b>cellular</b> <b>secretion,</b> but there have been no direct anion influx measurements in cells or granules to support this concept. We have found that ACBs inhibit only thrombin-induced platelet secretion, not secretion induced by ADP, collagen, or A 23187. ACBs inhibit thrombin esterolytic activity, binding of thrombin to platelets, and thrombin-stimulated platelet production of malondialdehyde in proportion to the degree of inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet secretion. Thus inhibition of platelet secretion by ACBs is due to inactivation of the stimulatory agonist, thrombin, and not to interference with <b>cellular</b> <b>secretion</b> per se. We have also found that previously reported inhibition of secretion of parathyroid cells and neutrophils by ACBs {{can be explained by the}} ability of ACBs to interfere with detection of the cellular secretory products that were measured to assess exocytosis. Our measurements of parathyroid hormone and beta-glucuronidase in the presence of ACBs were reduced to the same degree as the reported reduction in apparent <b>cellular</b> <b>secretion</b> produced by these agents. We conclude that plasma membrane anion channels of the type that can be blocked by ACBs such as 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonic acid, 4 -acetamido- 4 '-isothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonic acid, suramin, and probenecid do not participate in cellular secretory processes. Whether other types of anion channels exist that are not affected by these ACBs and whether there are mechanisms of anion flux during secretion not dependent on channels remain open questions...|$|E

This increased level of synthesis and secretion is similar in HIV-infected subjects with no or few symptoms, in ARC patients and in AIDS patients.

On the other hand, spontaneous IgD secretion correlates with neither the percent nor the absolute number of T 4 or T 8 cells suggesting that the increase of IgD-secretion by B cells is independent of the T-cell defects.

The significant advantage provided by this technology is the ability to maintain a virgin surface prior to the commencement of the cell migration assay.

The aim of this work was to characterize the reverse T 3 (rT 3) action on calcium uptake and its involvement in immature rat Sertoli cell secretion. The results presented herein show that very low concentrations of rT 3 are able to increase calcium uptake after 1 min of exposure. The implication of T-type voltage-dependent calcium channels and chloride channels in the effect of rT 3 was evidenced using flunarizine and 9 -anthracene, respectively. Also, the rT 3 -induced calcium uptake was blocked {{in the presence of}} the RGD peptide (an inhibitor of integrin-ligand interactions). Therefore, our findings suggest that calcium uptake stimulated by rT 3 may be mediated by integrin αvβ 3. In addition, it was demonstrated that calcium uptake stimulated by rT 3 is PKC and ERK-dependent. Furthermore, the outcomes indicate that rT 3 also stimulates <b>cellular</b> <b>secretion</b> since the cells manifested a loss of fluorescence after 4 min incubation, indicating an exocytic quinacrine release that seems to be mediated by the integrin receptor.

The inner surface of microchannels prepared {{in this way}} was coated with a thin membrane of either Matrigel or a layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte to control cellular adhesion. The microchannels were then used as scaffolds for 3 D-confined epithelial cell culture. To show that our device {{can be used with}} several epithelial cell types from exocrine glandular tissues, we performed our biological studies on adherent epithelial prostate cells (non-malignant RWPE- 1 and invasive PC 3) and also on breast (non-malignant MCF 10 A) cells We observed that in static conditions cells adhere and proliferate to form a confluent layer in channels of 150 µm in diameter and larger, whereas cellular viability decreases with decreasing diameter of the channel. Matrigel and PSS (poly (sodium 4 -styrenesulphonate)) promote cell adhesion, whereas the cell proliferation rate was reduced on the PAH (poly (allylamine hydrochloride)) -terminated surface. Moreover infusing channels with a continuous flow did not induce any cellular detachment.

In this study, we performed small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening targeting membrane-trafficking genes for host factors required for PV replication. We identified valosin-containing protein (VCP/p 97) as a host factor of PV replication required after viral protein synthesis, and its ATPase activity was essential for PV replication. VCP colocalized with viral pro-teins 2 BC/ 2 C and 3 AB/ 3 B in PV-infected cells and showed an interaction with 2 BC and 3 AB but not with 2 C and 3 A. Knockdown of VCP did not suppress the replication of coxsackievirus B 3 or Aichi virus. A VCP-knockdown-resistant PVmutant had an A 4881 G (a mutation of E 253 G in 2 C) mutation, which is known as a determinant of a secretion inhibition-negative phenotype. However, knockdown of VCP did not affect the inhibition of <b>cellular</b> protein <b>secretion</b> caused by overexpression of each individ-ual viral protein.
