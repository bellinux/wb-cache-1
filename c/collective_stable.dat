5000|$|However, Dimayev’s {{particular}} importance {{lies in the}} role he played during the Chechen deportation. On the 23rd of February 1944, the Chechens were suddenly woken at dawn, “crammed into lorries,… brought to the railway stations and packed ‘like sardines’ into cargo and cattle cars”.28 Taking a twenty-day-long in unventilated trains,29 the Chechens found their ties to history and their kindred brutally maimed. Deemed an impediment to the journey, many of the aged “who could not be moved from their beds, were either killed or …left to starve unattended”,30 while at Khaybakh, 770 women, children and aged “were shut in the <b>collective</b> <b>stable,</b> which was then set ablaze”.31 Aside from the trauma of those who eventually ‘resettled’ in the Kazakh and Kirgiz SSRs, these events marked the destruction of living links to the past, presenting Chechen historical consciousness - and therefore Chechen culture itself - with the danger of total annihilation. Dimayev thus went from scribe to warrior, fighting the extermination of his culture and people by actively linking {{them back to their}} origins. Just as the leaders of Qadiriyya Sufi orders 32 linked the Chechens back to God via their place in the silsilah - a “chain …of spiritual lineage” tracing back to the Prophet and ultimately to God 33 - Umar’s music served to link Chechens back to both their homeland and the departed, retaining their sense of historical consciousness and therefore their distinctive cultural identity. Raman Paskayev recalled how, as a young boy in exile, his fellow Chechens “would gather at the homes of radio owners to listen to Umar’s broadcasts”. The transmissions, lasting barely fifteen minutes, had an overwhelming effect; when they ended, “the men would hide their wet eyes, and the mothers cried quietly”.34 By bringing Chechens together in this gathering of grief, Dimayev was performing the traditional role of musical healer in an unprecedented manner, healing their hearts by providing an outlet for the expression of a silent, unsurpassable pain. By creating music in his present moment, he provided a living link to the past, giving them the fortitude to resist their systematic extermination. As his son Ali stated during the second Russo-Chechen war, “So long as music and dance are not taken from us, our nation will live, we won't lose our identity, and we won't be defeated”.35 ...|$|E

30|$|In {{contrast}} to these positive associations of in-group bias with collectivism, opposing relationships {{may also be}} plausible. Hogg (2000, 2007) observed that stable identities in a pre-modern society {{have been replaced by}} an atomistic individual-oriented society, which is accompanied by an erosion of traditional community links and <b>stable</b> <b>collective</b> identification targets. This lose connection of the self to various possible groups then leads to a greater concern with group identities as well as a heightened need to establish and maintain links to in-groups. In more collectivistic settings, people do not need to worry about their identities or level of inclusion in the group since individual-group links are stable and not negotiable. People have typically little choice to stay or leave a group and fewer in-groups pervade more aspects of everyday life compared to more individualistic societies, where multiple potential in-groups are available, but temporally and geographically separated. This so-called ‘postmodern paradox’ therefore leads to individuals in highly individualistic societies to yearn for collective affiliations. The evidence supporting either of the two mechanisms is mixed (e.g., Brown et al. 1992; Capozza et al. 2000).|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the collective dynamics {{of a network}} of inertia particles diffusing in a ratchet potential and interacting indirectly through their stochastic dynamical environment. We obtain analytically the condition for the existence of a <b>stable</b> <b>collective</b> state, and we show that the number N of particles in the network, and the strength k of their interaction with the environment, play key roles in synchronization and transport processes. Synchronization is preceded by symmetry-breaking associated with double-resonance oscillations and is shown to be strongly dependent on the network size: convergence to the synchronization manifold occurs much faster with a large network. For small networks, increasing the noise level enhances synchronization in the weakly coupled regime, while particles in a large network are weakly synchronized. Similarly, in the strongly coupled regime, particles in a small network are weakly synchronized; whereas the synchronization is strong and robust against noise when the network-size is large. Small and moderate networks maximize and stabilize efficient transport. Although the dynamics for larger networks is highly correlated, the transport current is erratic.

50|$|Social {{representations}} should neither be {{equated with}} relatively <b>stable</b> <b>collective</b> representations, nor {{should they be}} confused with individual, cognitive representations. This has been elaborated by several authors who contributed to the theory: Gerard Duveen and Barbara Lloyd emphasized the articulation {{of the individual and}} the collective in micro-genetic processes of socialization, Wolfgang Wagner theorized about the role of action and social interaction in the construction of social representations, and Sandra Jovchelovitch proposed to regard social representations as a space in-between, at the cross-roads between the individual and society that is the public sphere, that links objects, subjects and activities. Most authors agree that social representations are dynamic elements of knowledge that depend on social conflict and dispute to originate and that have a history of elaboration and change over time. Bauer & Gaskell integrate this view in their formal model relating three elements: subjects, or carriers of the representation; an object, activity, or idea that is represented; and a project of a social group within which the representation makes sense. This conceptualisation is known as the toblerone model of social representations.|$|R

This connection arises from the low-energy theory of both systems being described by a tight-binding model of Majorana modes. In Kitaev spin models the Majorana description provides a convenient representation to solve the model, whereas {{in an array of}} Josephson junctions of topological nanowires it arises from localized physical Majorana modes tunneling between the wire ends. We explicitly show that an array of junctions of three wires—a setup relevant to topological quantum computing with nanowires—can realize the Yao-Kivelson model, a variant of Kitaev spin models on a decorated honeycomb lattice. Employing properties of the latter, we show that the network can be constructed to give rise to two-dimensional collective topological states characterized by Chern numbers ν = 0, ± 1, and ± 2, and that defects in the array can be associated with vortex-like quasiparticle excitations. In addition we show that the <b>collective</b> states are <b>stable</b> in the presence of disorder and superconducting phase fluctuations.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of a {{probabilistic}} refractory period in the collective behavior of coupled discrete-time excitable cells (SIRS-like cellular automata). Using mean-field analysis and simulations, we show that a synchronized phase with <b>stable</b> <b>collective</b> oscillations exists even with non-deterministic refractory periods. Moreover, further increasing the coupling strength leads to a reentrant transition, where the synchronized phase loses stability. In an intermediate regime, we also observe bistability (and consequently hysteresis) between a synchronized phase and an active but incoherent phase without oscillations. The onset of the oscillations appears in the mean-field equations as a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, the nature of which (i. e. super- or subcritical) is determined by the first Lyapunov coefficient. This allows us to determine the borders of the oscillating and of the bistable regions. The mean-field prediction thus obtained agrees quantitatively with simulations of complete graphs and, for random graphs, qualitatively predicts the overall structure of the phase diagram. The latter can be obtained from simulations by defining an order parameter q suited for detecting collective oscillations of excitable elements. We briefly review other commonly used order parameters and show (via data collapse) that q satisfies the expected finite size scaling relations. Comment: 19 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{radiation}} emission from electrons wiggling in a laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) process, being initially {{considered as}} a parasitic effect for the electron energy gain, can eventually serve as a novel X-ray source, {{that could be used}} for diagnostic purposes. Although several schemes for enhancing the X-ray emission in LWFA has been recently proposed and analyzed, finding an efficient way to use and control these radiation emissions remains an important problem. Based on analytical estimates and 3 D particle-in-cell simulations, we here propose and examine a new method utilizing two colliding LWFA patterns with an angle in-between their propagation directions. Varying the angle of collision, the distance of acceleration before the collision and other parameters provide an unprecedented control over the emission parameters. Moreover, we reveal here that for a collision angle of 5 ^∘, the two wakefields merge into a single LWFA cavity inducing strong and <b>stable</b> <b>collective</b> oscillations between the two trapped electron bunches. This results in an X-ray emission which is strongly peaked, both in the spatial and frequency domain. The basic concept of the proposed scheme may pave a way for using LWFA radiation sources in many important applications, such as phase-contrast radiography. Comment: 7 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
