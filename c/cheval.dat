5|$|Nansouty's final {{campaign}} {{took place}} in 1814 on French soil, under bleak circumstances for the French, who saw huge Coalition armies invade France {{at the beginning of}} that year. During this campaign, his command, 5,000 Horse Guards, included the 1st and 2nd Chevau-légers Lanciers regiments, under General Édouard Colbert, the Chasseurs à <b>Cheval,</b> under General Laferrière, the Grenadiers à <b>Cheval</b> under General Guyot, the Dragons, under General Letort, as well as the entire Guard horse artillery.|$|E
5|$|The Castillonais or <b>Cheval</b> Ariègeois de Castillon, {{once called}} the <b>cheval</b> du Biros or Saint-Gironnais, {{is an ancient}} breed of small riding horse from the Ariège département of southwestern France. The breed's {{phenotype}} is currently in flux, but overall it resembles (and is sometimes confused with) the more common Merens horse. Members of the breed are either dark bay or black, and all have pangare color modification, which results in paler color around the eyes and muzzle and {{on the underside of}} the body. Today it is used principally for pleasure riding (including equine tourism) and driving.|$|E
5|$|A {{report from}} 9 July 1796 showed that Saint-Cyr's Center had two {{divisions}} under Duhesme and Taponier. In Duhesme's division, Dominique Vandamme's brigade included the 17th Line (2,793) and 100th Line (2,479), 20th Chasseurs à <b>Cheval</b> (254) and 11th Hussars (38). Duhesme's division counted 5,272 infantry and 292 cavalry. Taponier's division {{consisted of the}} brigades of Henri François Lambert, Antoine Laroche Dubouscat and Claude Lecourbe. Lambert led the 93rd Line (3,119) and 109th Line (2,769). Laroche directed the 21st Light (2,284) and 31st Line (2,840). Lecourbe commanded the 84th Line (2,692), 106th Line (3,186) and 2nd Chasseurs à <b>Cheval</b> (240). There were a total of 22,162 foot soldiers, 532 horsemen and 433 gunners in Saint-Cyr's wing. However, a 14 June report showed 919 troopers present in Saint-Cyr's command, including the 9th Hussars.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1850s, {{with the arrival of}} the Second French Empire, the Anglo-Norman became a popular breed in France, {{competing}} with the Thoroughbred. It was reputed to be a versatile horse, appropriate for riding and pulling light carriages. From 1840 to 1860, the breed was further influenced by part-Thoroughbred trotting horses from England. Local Norman mares were crossed with imported Thoroughbreds, Norfolk Trotters, Orlov Trotters and other crossbred horses, which themselves had Norfolk and Mecklenburger blood. By 1855, the quality of the resulting animals had ensured the breed's success, and the Anglo-Norman spread throughout France, especially supplanting another type of riding horse from the south, the Limousin horse. In 1864, the Société du <b>cheval</b> français de demi-sang (Society of French Half-Blood Horses) was founded, which later became the Société d'encouragement à l'élevage du <b>cheval</b> français (Society to Encourage French Horse Breeding). The breeders spread the description of Norman horses, particularly Anglo-Normans, as versatile horses that could be used for both riding and driving.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{phase of the}} campaign, Nansouty's {{division}} was at first attached to Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps, with which it crossed the Rhine and then the Danube, before rejoining Murat's cavalry reserve. Nansouty had a first opportunity to lead his men into combat at the Battle of Wertingen, where his men were noted for their excellent manoeuvring. Detaching his two Carabiniers-à-Cheval regiments, which {{he had to leave}} with Murat, Nansouty and his reduced division followed the Emperor at Augsburg, where he was attached to Marshal Jean Lannes's V Corps. In this capacity, they supported Walther's division at the Battle of Schöngrabern. Then, at the Battle of Wischau on 25 November 1805, the 9th Cuirassiers participated in a major cavalry action, alongside d'Hautpoul's cuirassier division, Walther's dragoons and Bessières's Grenadiers à <b>Cheval</b> and Chasseurs à <b>Cheval</b> of the Guard cavalry.|$|E

5|$|They first {{prepared}} a <b>cheval</b> de frise to prevent British ships from sailing up the Hudson and outflanking the American position. For {{more than a}} month, the troops transported boulders from the heights of Manhattan {{to the edge of}} the river, where they loaded them into a collection of hulks and cribs made of timber and stretched it across the river. When the <b>cheval</b> de frise was finished, they began work on the fort. Little soil covered the rocky surface, so men had to haul soil up from the low ground. They were unable to dig the customary ditches or trenches around the fort. The fort was built in the shape of a pentagon with five bastions. The main walls were made of earth, constructed with ravelins with openings for guns from every angle. The fort enclosed a total of three to four acres. The troops built an abbattis around the fort. After the barracks were finished in September, all the troops in the area were placed under the command of Major General William Heath. Washington established his headquarters near the fort.|$|E

5|$|As it {{has been}} since the {{creation}} of the Auxois stud book, only purebred horses and Ardennes and Trait du Nord crosses are allowed to be registered. This is to ensure selection for the desired breed characteristics, which are now a lighter and more active horse than was seen during the time of breeding for horse meat. Horses bred through artificial insemination and embryo transfer are allowed to be registered; those potentially bred through cloning are not. The Syndicat du <b>Cheval</b> de Trait Auxois (Auxois Draft Horse Association) is the national registry, managing the stud book, breed standard and promotion of the breed. An annual breed competition is held in September in Semur-en-Auxois.|$|E
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the War of the Second Coalition in 1799, when the armies of the Danube and Helvetia were formed, he was {{assigned}} to the Army of the Danube under command of Jean Baptiste Jourdan. His 10th Regiment was part of Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr's III. Division, and held the far left flank at the Battle of Ostrach, 21 March 1799, in southwestern Germany. Although he was wounded on 14 August 1799 in Switzerland, he participated in the Second Battle of Zurich in which his 10th Chasseurs à <b>Cheval</b> routed a division of Russians, a decisive moment in the French victory. Ordener was promoted to colonel of the regiment in 1801 and on 29 August 1803, he was promoted to general of brigade.|$|E

5|$|During the Saxon {{campaign}} of 1813, Walther continued {{command of the}} Guard Cavalry, and {{was present at the}} Battle of Lützen and Battle of Dresden, as commander of the Guard cavalry. At the Second Battle of Kulm (17 September 1813), he commanded the Imperial Guard Cavalry including the dragoons, Grenadiers à <b>Cheval,</b> and 1st (Polish) and 2nd (Dutch) Lancers. At the Battle of Leipzig, he commanded the 3rd Division of the cavalry of the Imperial Guard: The total cavalry of the Guard included 7,903men and 18guns.

50|$|<b>Cheval’s</b> artwork is crafted {{with the}} virtuosity of great masters {{belonging}} to the Golden Age of Dutch art and conjures visions of supernatural domains, doorways into parallel realities, and glimpses {{into the world of}} absurdity (13). The irrational and the mysterious is expressed simply and clearly in his paintings, which are often similar to photographs. The familiar, however, is inevitably invaded by the unreal: unfeasible spheres, floating under the arches of gothic cathedrals, a violin sliding down the pipes, countless masks, continually changing and leaving their characters for different roles. Moments of time collide; threads from one world seep into another; life on its stage with the fine strings controlling our actions is caught, momentarily, like a photo somehow capturing the hand of God.|$|R

500|$|After {{his return}} to Norway in 1942, Andersen carried out the {{assassination}} of well-known informer Raymond Colberg and then made good his escape to Sweden. Colberg had {{been active in the}} Sandefjord area, uncovering an illegal radio transmitter. This led to the arrest of eight resistance members in March 1941, three of whom were executed (Øivind Ask, Andreas Bertnes and Johan Midttun were shot 4 December 1941). Andersen carried out the assassination of the Abwehr agent together {{with his wife and two}} acquaintances, kidnapping him and killing him at the animal hospital <b>Chevals</b> kjeller. According to Ruth Andersen's later interrogation records, the killing was carried out by crucifying him with four knives and crushing his bones with iron pipes, then dismembering the body, putting it in a container for animal carcasses and dumping it in the river Akerselva. The confession may have been made under torture, and included no reference to the bullet holes found on Colberg's corpse when it was recovered. According to historian and leader of Norway's Resistance Museum, Arnfinn Moland, the claims of Colberg having been tortured and mutilated are fabrications. Moland cites autopsy reports and German archives to back up his claims. Colberg's body was discovered by a Norwegian civilian on 15 June 1942 with two 7,62 mm calibre bullet holes in the head, and was identified through Colberg's dental records. The killing was, according to Ulateig, also motivated by Andersen's personal feelings towards Colberg, and Moland states that Andersen [...] "may have had" [...] such motives, a claim that is refuted by history professor Tore Pryser.|$|R
