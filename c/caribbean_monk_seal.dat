5|$|All species {{experienced}} over-hunting by sealers. The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} experienced population drops in the 19th century and during World War II, and the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> was exploited since the 1500s until the 1850s, when populations were {{too low to}} hunt commercially. The Mediterranean monk seal has experienced commercial hunting since the Middle Ages and eradication by fishermen. Monk seals have developed a fear of humans, and may even abandon beaches due to human presence. There are currently around 1,700 monk seals in total.|$|E
5|$|Monk seals are {{earless seals}} {{of the tribe}} Monachini. They are the only earless seals found in {{tropical}} climates. There are two genera of monk seals, Monachus and Neomonachus, comprising three species: the Mediterranean monk seal, Monachus monachus; the Hawaiian monk seal, Neomonachus schauinslandi; and the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal,</b> Neomonachus tropicalis, which became extinct in the 20th century. The two surviving species are now rare and in imminent danger of extinction. All three monk seal species were classified in genus Monachus until 2014, when the Caribbean and Hawaiian species were placed into a new genus, Neomonachus.|$|E
5|$|The meat, blubber and fur {{coats of}} {{pinnipeds}} {{have traditionally been}} used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for their products, seals and walruses are now protected by international law. The Japanese sea lion and the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> have become extinct in the past century, while the Mediterranean monk seal and Hawaiian monk seal are ranked endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from accidental trapping, marine pollution, and conflicts with local people.|$|E
5|$|Not much {{is known}} of the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal's</b> reproduction. It is thought that they bore a single pup every two years. Their {{gestation}} period, lactating period, and sexual maturity age are unknown.|$|R
500|$|<b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> had a {{relatively}} large, long, robust body, could grow to nearly [...] {{in length and}} weighed [...] Males were probably slightly larger than females, {{which is similar to}} Mediterranean <b>monk</b> <b>seals.</b> Like other <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> this species had a distinctive head and face. The head was rounded with an extended broad muzzle. The face had relatively large wide-spaced eyes, upward opening nostrils, and fairly big whisker pads with long light-colored and smooth whiskers. When compared to the body, the animal's foreflippers were relatively short with little claws and the hindflippers were slender. Their coloration was brownish and/or grayish, with the underside lighter than the dorsal area. Adults were darker than the more paler and yellowish younger <b>seals.</b> <b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> were also known to have algae growing on their pelage, giving them a slightly greenish appearance, which is similar to Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> {{had a long}} pupping season, {{which is}} typical for {{pinnipeds}} living in subtropical and tropical habitats. In Mexico, breeding season peaked in early December. Like other <b>monk</b> <b>seals,</b> this species had four retractable nipples for suckling their young. Newborn pups were probably about 1 m in length and weighed 16 to 18 kg and reportedly had a sleek, black lanugo coat when born. [...] It is believed this animal's average lifespan was approximately twenty years.|$|R
25|$|There are 90 {{species of}} mammals in the Caribbean {{including}} sperm whales, humpback whales and dolphins. The island of Jamaica {{is home to}} seals and manatees. The <b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> which lived in the Caribbean is considered extinct. The solenodon is endangered.|$|E
500|$|The {{extinction}} of the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> was mainly triggered by overhunting {{in the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries to obtain the oil held within their blubber, fueled by the large demand for seal products. As early as 1688, sugar plantation owners sent out hunting parties to kill hundreds of seals every night for blubber oil to lubricate [...] machinery. The Caribbean monk seals’ docile nature and lack of an instinctive fear of humans made it an easy target, and hunting only ended (in the 1850s) because the population was too low for commercial use. Overfishing of the reefs that sustained the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> population also contributed to their extinction. Fish stock decline in the Caribbean starved the remaining populations. Little was done to protect the Caribbean monk seal; by the time it was placed on the endangered species list in 1967, it was likely already extinct.|$|E
500|$|Monk seals are {{earless seals}} (true seals) {{of the tribe}} Monachini. The tribe was first {{conceived}} by Victor Blanchard Scheffer in his 1958 book Seals, Sea Lions, and Walruses: A Review of the Pinnipedia. There are two genera of monk seals, Monachus and Neomonachus, comprising three species: the Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus), the Hawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi), and the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> (Neomonachus tropicalis), which became extinct in the 20th century. All three monk seal species were classified in genus Monachus until 2014, when comparison of the species' mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA sequences led biologists to place the Caribbean and Hawaiian species in a new genus, Neomonachus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> {{were found}} in warm temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the west Atlantic Ocean. They probably preferred to haul out at sites (low sandy beaches above high tide) on isolated and secluded atolls and islands, but occasionally would visit the mainland coasts and deeper waters offshore. This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs.|$|R
50|$|Again, {{the exact}} site of their {{landfall}} is controversial. The vicinity of Charlotte Harbor {{is the most}} commonly identified spot, while some assert a landing further north at Tampa Bay or even Pensacola. Other historians have argued the distances were too great to cover in the available time and the more likely location was Cape Romano or Cape Sable. Here Ponce de León anchored for several days to take on water and repair the ships. They were approached by Calusa, {{who might have been}} initially interested in trading but relations soon turned hostile. Several skirmishes followed with casualties on both sides and the Spaniards took eight Indians captive, including one to become a translator. On June 4, there was another encounter with natives near Sanibel Island and the Calusa in war canoes, with the Spanish sinking a fourth of them. An unsubstantiated claim to justify Spanish retreat. On June 14 they set sail again looking for a chain of islands in the west that had been described by their captives. They reached the Dry Tortugas on June 21. There they captured giant sea turtles, <b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seals,</b> and thousands of seabirds. From these islands they sailed southwest in an apparent attempt to circle around Cuba and return home to Puerto Rico. Failing {{to take into account the}} powerful currents pushing them eastward, they struck the northeast shore of Cuba and were initially confused about their location.|$|R

500|$|As of 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 35 {{pinniped}} species. With the Japanese {{sea lion}} and the <b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> recently extinct, ten more are considered at risk, {{as they are}} ranked [...] "Critically Endangered" [...] (the Mediterranean and Hawaiian monk seals), [...] "Endangered" [...] (Galápagos fur seal, Australian sea lion, Caspian seal and Galápagos sea lion), and [...] "Vulnerable" [...] (northern fur seal, hooded seal and New Zealand sea lion).

500|$|The <b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> {{has been}} killed and {{exploited}} by Europeans settlers and their descendants since 1494, starting with Christopher Columbus himself. The seals were easy targets for organized sealers, fishermen, turtle hunters and buccaneers because they evolved with little pressure from terrestrial predators and were thus [...] "genetically tame". In the Bahamas, as many as 100 seals were slaughtered in one night. In the mid-nineteenth century, the species was thought to have gone extinct until a small colony was found near the Yucatán Peninsula in 1886. Seal killings continued, and the last reliable report of the animal alive was in 1952. The IUCN declared it extinct in 1996. The Japanese sea lion was common around the Japanese islands, but overexploitation and competition from fisheries drastically decreased {{the population in the}} 1930s. The last recorded individual was a juvenile in 1974.|$|E
2500|$|The Tequestas did not {{practice}} {{any form of}} agriculture. They fished, hunted, and gathered the fruit and roots of local plants. Most of their food came from the sea. Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, who lived among the tribes of southern Florida for seventeen years in the 16th century, described their [...] "common" [...] diet as [...] "fish, turtle and snails, [...] whale, the [...] "sea-wolf" [...] (<b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal)</b> was reserved for the upper classes. According to Fontaneda, a lesser part of the diet consisted of trunkfish and lobster. The [...] "fish" [...] caught included manatees, sharks, sailfish, porpoises, stingrays, and small fish. Despite their local abundance, clams, oysters and conches were only a minor part of the Tequesta diet (their shells are much less common at Tequesta archeological sites than they are at Calusa or Jaega sites). Venison was also popular; deer bones are frequently found in archeological sites, as are terrapin shells and bones. Sea turtles and their eggs were consumed during the turtles' nesting season.|$|E

40|$|The {{endangered}} Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> {{has been}} undergoing dramatic population declines for several decades. These declines {{may be linked}} to food resources or environmental changes and this is reflected in the stable isotope analysis of the <b>monk</b> <b>seals.</b> The use of stable carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotope ratios on Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> bone collagen samples collected from 1912 through 2006 determined that changes within the environment and food web of the Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> may be factors contributing to the decrease in the population. Over the ninety-four year period the overall δ 15 N of the <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> was depleted by approximately 3 ‰ and the δ 13 C had minimal changes. <b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> located within the northern extent of the NWHI exhibited the most dramatic changes in stable isotopes. From 1923 through 2006 the δ 15 N of the Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> within this area was depleted nearly 6 ‰, while δ 13 C was enriched by 2 ‰. This significant depletion in δ 15 N, along with the enrichment within the δ 13 C for the northern NWHI could be caused by an increase in the primary productivity within the area, leading to a shorter food web. This inverse relationship within the northern NWHI could also be a representation of the <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> foraging more on benthic rather than pelagic prey, or foraging inshore rather than offshore in this region. This northern region was in contrast to the Central and southern islands within the NWHI. The central NWHI seals had nominal change in their δ 15 N and δ 13 C from 1912 to 2006; whereas, the southern NWHI seals exhibited a 3. 5 ‰ depletion in δ 15 N and a nearly 1 ‰ depletion in δ 13 C over the span from 1951 through 2006. Within the central NWHI the juvenile <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> were more depleted in δ 15 N as compared to the adult <b>monk</b> <b>seals,</b> which could indicate a prey base change for these seals. Within the southern NWHI {{there was a significant difference}} within δ 15 N and δ 13 C over the decades of the study which could indicate a decrease in the regional productivity. The adult <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> within the southern region also had an increase in δ 15 N which could be a indicator of starvation for the seals within this region. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes indicate modern <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> (2000 - 2006) foraged on a number of different teleost, crustacean, eel, and cephalopod species, correlating to earlier and current studies being conducted on the food sources of the Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seal,</b> as {{the name}} suggests, lives solely in the Hawaiian archipelago. <b>Monk</b> <b>seals</b> {{migrated}} to Hawaii between 4–11 million years ago (mya) through an open water passage between North and South America called the Central American Seaway. The Isthmus of Panama closed the Seaway approximately 3 million years ago. The species may have evolved in the Pacific or Atlantic, but in either case, came to Hawaii long before the first Polynesians. When <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> are not hunting or eating, they generally bask on the beaches; Hawaiian <b>monk</b> <b>seals</b> tend to bask on sandy beaches and volcanic rock of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{sea lion}} and <b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> {{disappeared}} in the 1950s, the last aquatic mammals to become extinct.

5000|$|Through {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, <b>Caribbean</b> <b>monk</b> <b>seal</b> {{sightings}} became much more rare.
