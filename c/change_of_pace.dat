5|$|Cagney's {{two films}} of 1938, Boy Meets Girl and Angels with Dirty Faces, both costarred Pat O'Brien. The former had Cagney {{in a comedy}} role, and {{received}} mixed reviews. Warner Bros. had allowed Cagney his <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> but was keen {{to get him back}} to playing tough guys, which was more lucrative. Ironically, the script for Angels was one that Cagney had hoped to do while with Grand National, but the studio had been unable to secure funding.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930, and particularly its edicts concerning on-screen violence, Warners allowed Cagney a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace.</b> They cast him in the comedy Blonde Crazy, again opposite Blondell. As he completed filming, The Public Enemy was filling cinemas with all-night showings. Cagney began to compare his pay with his peers, thinking his contract allowed for salary adjustments based on the success of his films. Warner Bros. disagreed, however, and refused to give him a raise. The studio heads also insisted that Cagney continue promoting their films, even ones he was not in, which he opposed. Cagney moved back to New York, leaving his brother Bill to look after his apartment.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was known}} for his {{composure}} and ability to score several goals for his team as a forward, Bergkamp was also capable of playing behind a lone striker, where he essentially functioned in the number 10 role as a playmaking attacking midfielder or deep-lying forward, due to his ball skills and creative ability, which enabled him to drop deep between the lines and link-up play. A quick, elegant, intelligent, and technically gifted player, his excellent first touch, quick feet, dribbling ability, and <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> enabled him to beat defenders in one on one situations, while his attacking movement, physique, balance, and close control allowed him to hold up the ball and create space for teammates; his vision and passing range with both feet, despite being naturally right-footed, subsequently allowed him to provide assists for on-running strikers. Bergkamp often stated he preferred playing in this deeper role, as he derived more pleasure from assisting goals, rather than scoring them himself.|$|E
25|$|Giffen was {{a robust}} batsman noted for his driving {{he also had}} a fine cut and glance. A slow to medium pace bowler he was {{brilliant}} with his deceptive off spin and the master in flight and <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> which he took many wickets.|$|R
50|$|The lower {{weight of}} an open-wheel racecar allows for better performance. While the {{exposure}} of the wheels to the airstream causes a very high aerodynamic drag at high speeds, it allows improved cooling of the brakes, which is important on road courses with their frequent <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace.</b>|$|R
25|$|A show jumping rider {{will have}} a shorter stirrup than other English riders, in order to {{maximize}} the jumping effort of the horse. However, the rider also has the challenge of staying on over the fence and controlling the horse through rapid <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> and direction, so still needs some length of leg for stability.|$|R
25|$|Electric Vehicle Associates (EVA) of Cleveland, {{was best}} known for its <b>Change</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pace</b> model – a built-to-order {{adaptation}} of the Pacer that was priced at $12,360 in 1978. The company converted well over 100 units.|$|E
25|$|Warners {{allowed him}} a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> a screwball comedy, Footsteps in the Dark (1941), {{but it was}} not a success. Far more popular was the {{military}} drama, Dive Bomber (1941); this was his last film with Curtiz.|$|E
25|$|Fairbanks Jr. {{began to}} work {{increasingly}} in action/adventure films: The Sun Never Sets, Rulers of the Sea, Green Hell, Safari. He had a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> when he starred in and co-produced Angels Over Broadway. His last film before enlisting was The Corsican Brothers (1941).|$|E
5000|$|AllMusic {{commented on}} how {{all members of}} the band shared a love for pop punk and Third Eye Blind leading to A <b>Change</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pace's</b> style being {{described}} as [...] "explosive, pop-edged alternative rock". Reviews have cited them as showing influence from a variety of rock genres including: pop punk, alternative rock, post-hardcore, screamo, melodic hardcore, pop rock, hard rock, punk rock and indie rock.|$|R
5000|$|World Funeral is {{the eighth}} studio album by Swedish black metal band Marduk. It was {{recorded}} and mixed at The Abyss between September and November {{and was released}} on March 25, 2003 by Regain Records. The track listing of the album is organized as to create a dynamic <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>paces</b> and atmospheres, the tracks generally alternating between a fast, slow, fast, etc. pattern.|$|R
5000|$|Performance horses, {{like human}} athletes, place a high amount of stress on their bones and joints. This is {{especially}} true if the horse jumps, gallops, or performs sudden turns or <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> {{as can be seen}} in racehorses, show jumpers, eventers, polo ponies, reiners, and western performance horses. A high percentage of performance horses develop arthritis, especially if they are worked intensely when young or are worked on poor footing.|$|R
25|$|For a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> {{he did a}} musical, So This Is Paris (1955), then it {{was back}} to more typical fare: Six Bridges to Cross (1955), as a bank robber; The Purple Mask (1955), a swashbuckler; The Square Jungle (1955), a boxing film.|$|E
25|$|McDermott and McGrath drove {{ripped through}} the upper order in their opening spells to leave the {{visitors}} 27/6. Ramprakash and Rhodes scored a partnership of 68 for the seventh wicket, the former seduced into a lazy cut to gully by Mark Waugh's <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> ending the resistance as England stumbled to 123 all out, McDermott raising his series tally to 32 wickets.|$|E
25|$|Warners let him try a screwball comedy as a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> Four's a Crowd (1938). Despite the {{presence}} of de Havilland and direction of Curtiz, {{it was not a}} success. More popular was a melodrama with Bette Davis, The Sisters (1938). He had a strong dramatic part in the all-male anti-war film, The Dawn Patrol (1938), alongside David Niven, then made his first Western, Dodge City (1939), with Curtiz and de Havilland.|$|E
50|$|It {{was a major}} vote of {{confidence}} in Holland, who missed most of 2007-08 with a shoulder problem. A former Australia under-19s player who has also spent time at the Centre of Excellence, Holland is a naturally attacking spinner who has subtle <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> and can turn the ball sharply. A former sports science student, he was upgraded to a full Victoria contract for 2009-10 after three years on the rookie list.|$|R
5000|$|Stephen Royston Barwick (born 6 September 1960) is {{a former}} Welsh cricketer. Barwick was a {{right-handed}} batsman who began his career a right-arm medium-fast bowler, before adding variation in the form <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> and off cutters, with his restyled bowling being termed by fellow professionals like Andrew Caddick as the [...] "slowest seam bowling around". Playing for Glamorgan for 18 seasons, he took 768 wickets in all formats of the game.|$|R
5000|$|Justin Clark from Joystiq {{gave the}} game a 4.5/5, praising the level design, <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pacing</b> and scale in {{adventure}} mode, new characters and items, {{as well as}} the Hook Hat, a new feature in LittleBigPlanet 3. He also praised the user-friendly and satisfying creation mode and accessible tutorial. He stated that [...] "LittleBigPlanet 3 is a foundation, upon which eager minds can start building even more inspiring content, and that process has been made more accessible than ever before." ...|$|R
25|$|Early in his {{international}} career, Waugh was a natural, uninhibited strokeplayer {{who liked}} to drive off the back foot. He could score quickly, but was inconsistent at Test level and seemed better suited to ODI cricket. In the shorter game, he often accelerated the scoring in the later overs of the innings. As a bowler, he employed a carefully disguised slower ball bowled {{from the back of}} the hand, and regularly sent down the final overs, when this <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> was difficult to score from.|$|E
25|$|Ladd's next {{role was}} a {{significant}} <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> playing Jay Gatsby in the 1949 version of The Great Gatsby, written and produced by Richard Maibaum. This film had been planned since 1946, but production was delayed due {{to a combination of}} difficulties with the censor, and Paramount's reluctance for Ladd to play such a challenging part. It was not a big success at the box office and its mixed critical and commercial reception caused Ladd to shy away from serious dramatic roles afterwards.|$|E
25|$|When The X-Files {{ended in}} 2002, she {{moved back to}} London for a {{complete}} <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> {{and the opportunity to}} return to the stage. In 2002, Anderson made her West End debut in Michael Weller's play What The Night Is For at the Comedy Theatre. In 2004, Anderson starred in the Royal Court Theatre's production of Rebecca Gilman's play The Sweetest Swing in Baseball, as artist Dana Fielding who assumes the personality of the troubled baseball player Darryl Strawberry – a role for which she earned rave reviews.|$|E
5000|$|Andy Kellman of AllMusic said, [...] "This {{is easily}} the group's most {{scattered}} album, as it offers various shades of ballads, some throwbacks, oddly escapist adult alternative fare, and even anthemic rockers. Many of them blur {{the line between}} fresh <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> and ill-suited switch-ups. [...] "Already Gone," [...] one that falls toward the latter, is schizophrenic itself, as it bounds between early-'80s arena rock and EDM. It's also one of many songs in which Auto-Tune is used -- easily the album's most baffling characteristic." ...|$|R
2500|$|Swann {{is noted}} {{for being an}} attacking spinner, {{generally}} delivering the ball with plenty of flight and bounce. He is also capable <b>of</b> subtle <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace.</b> Unlike many contemporary off-spinners he does not frequently bowl the doosra. Instead, his variations include a well-developed arm ball, and also a flatspinner delivery that he has nicknamed his [...] "flying saucer ball" [...] that rotates around its horizontal axis and generally bounces straight on. Commentator Peter Roebuck suggested in March 2010 that Swann's success has been due as much to his attitude as skill: ...|$|R
50|$|At only 27 minutes long, {{and with}} so many <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> and style, We Are a Unit is a breathtaking listen. But it's this brevity and {{diversity}} that allows Castrovalva to shine where other fearsome live acts have failed - to make a record that does their performances justice. Maybe you can't see the sweat on their brows or feel the cheap lager being thrown overhead, but whenever this album comes clattering into your ears, your gonna have to be fighting pretty damn {{hard not to be}} doing some table-somersaulting of your own.|$|R
25|$|A {{change of}} metre in Plautus often accompanies the exit or {{entrance}} of a character, and thus frames a scene. At {{other times it}} indicates a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> such as when Amphitruo's slave Sosia suddenly changes from iambic octonarii to a more excited cretic metre when he begins to describe a battle. In Terence different metres accompany different characters: for example, in each of Terence's plays, the woman loved by a young man uses iambic septenarii; in the Heauton Timorumenos, Eunuchus, and Phormio, {{one of the two}} young men is associated with trochaics, the other with iambics. Thus there can be frequent changes of metre within a single scene.|$|E
25|$|The Mayan Temple is {{the grand}} icon of Aquaventure, with {{a height of}} over six stories. The {{structure}} features a series of water rides, including the Leap of Faith, a 60-foot near-perpendicular plunge that sends riders through a clear acrylic tunnel submerged in a shark-filled lagoon. Also located atop the Mayan Temple are the Challenger Slides, two high-speed dueling slides where riders race against the clock for the best times. From just below, the Serpent Slide spins out from 48 feet up the Temple and into the Temple's dark core before emerging through the shark-filled lagoon at a more leisurely “shark-viewing” pace. For a milder <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> the Jungle Slide meanders through exotic jungles and caves built {{in the heart of}} the Mayan Temple.|$|E
25|$|For a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> Warners {{put him in}} {{a medical}} melodrama, Green Light (1937), playing a crusading doctor, a role {{originally}} intended for Leslie Howard. He then made another swashbuckler, replacing Patric Knowles in what was essentially a supporting role in The Prince and the Pauper (1937). He appeared opposite Kay Francis in Another Dawn (1937), a melodrama set in a British colony. Warners then gave Flynn his first starring role in a comedy, The Perfect Specimen (1937), with Joan Blondell under the direction of Curtiz. During this period Flynn published his first book, Beam Ends (1937), an autobiographical account of his sailing experiences around Australia as a youth. He also travelled to Spain, in 1937, as a war correspondent during the Spanish Civil War.|$|E

5000|$|Writing for Allmusic, critic William Ruhlman {{wrote that}} of the album, [...] "In putting {{together}} a repertoire to play to live audiences, the trio sometimes risks coming off as a novelty act, however, as they get laughs for [...] "What Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me)" [...] and the group-written [...] "Phonebooth of Love." [...] Such numbers serve as light entertainment and <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> in a show, but don't work as well on repeated listenings of a disc.

5000|$|A <b>Change</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pace's</b> {{music is}} drawn {{from a number of}} {{different}} bands, ranging from pop bands such as the Beatles, to metal bands such Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin and to the piano pop/rock of artists such as Five for Fighting and Ben Folds. The band however cites their major influence as alternative rock band Third Eye Blind. They have also been noted by AllMusic reviewer Jo-Ann Greene as showing: [...] "the sparkle of U2, the attitude of Green Day, a stinging arena rock-styled lead guitar solo, and a splash of new wave synth, deftly delivered by Dave Holdredge." ...|$|R
25|$|India won the toss, and Ganguly, {{elected to}} field, hoping to take {{advantage}} of a pitch left damp by dew and rain. On a lively Wanderers Stadium pitch, the Australian openers took advantage of very wayward Indian opening bowlers to get off to a flying start. Adam Gilchrist (57 from 48 balls, 8 fours, 1 six) and Matthew Hayden (37 from 54 balls, 5 fours) shared an opening partnership of 105 runs in 14 overs, forcing Ganguly to bring on the spinners unusually early. The <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> brought wickets with Adam Gilchrist, who had been swinging at everything, holing out off a sweep shot from the bowling of Harbhajan Singh. Matthew Hayden, looking somewhat better than he had throughout the tournament, soon followed for 37, leaving Australia at 2/125 Captain Ricky Ponting (140 from 121 balls, 4 fours, 8 sixes) and Damien Martyn (88 from 84 balls, 7 fours, 1 six) (playing with a broken thumb) completing a partnership of 234 runs in 30.1 overs, an Australian record for one-day cricket. Ponting and Martyn started efficiently, putting away bad balls but mostly keeping the scoring going with good running, then letting loose in the last ten overs, taking 109 from them. Ponting in particular dispatched the bowling over the fence with fearsome regularity in scoring 8 sixes, the most from one batsman in any World Cup match at the time. The final Australian total of 359 (2 wickets, 50 overs), at a run rate of 7.18 runs an over, was their then second highest ever in ODI history.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} finds Clarkson taking {{her time in}} love, and crooning about praising her lover. Sam Wilbur of AOL Radio is {{contented}} with the song's central theme, writing [...] "It's a simple, laid back love song that is a nice <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> for Clarkson who, along with 'Catch My Breath,' is singing more about love and happiness, instead of break-ups and heartbreak." ...|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers paid {{particular}} attention to Araya's vocal contribution. Zach Hothorn of Prefix magazine said the song [...] "allows Araya to show his vocal range, deepening to build up tension and creating a wonderfully chilling 3 and a half minutes", while Ian Robinson of musicOMH.com felt the track [...] "is a distinct but welcome <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> Dave Lombardo's machine-gun rhythms forming the backbone for Tom Araya's impressively intact scream." ...|$|E
25|$|A right-arm fast-medium bowler capable <b>of</b> {{generating}} good <b>pace</b> with late swing, he is {{a genuine}} strike bowler. Although he was prone to leaking runs in his earlier career, of late he has used vast county experience to be economical in death overs. He often bowls the reverse-swinging yorker in one day and T20 cricket and has good control over <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> though he sometimes can be expensive. Rana is also a useful attacking lower-order batsman with 5 first-class centuries and many fifties, including a score of 95 in 57 balls in a T20 game which lifted his team Sialkot Stallions to the tournament final. He left playing cricket {{due to personal reasons}} during 1995–1999.|$|R
30|$|Patellar {{tendinopathy}} {{has a high}} prevalence {{rate among}} athletes (Larsson et al., 2012). This is especially so in sports that involve repetitive movements that cause an overload of the tendon like jumping, <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> and direction as well as racing and pedalling. It appears in both professional athletes and amateurs (Childress and Beutler, 2013). Classically, the term tendinitis was used considering that the fundamental lesion was an inflammation of the tendon. Today, we know, histologically speaking, {{that we can find}} degenerated tissue with fragmentation, an alteration of the collagen and vascular hyperplasia, with inflammatory cells almost absent (Cook and Purdam, 2009; Khan et al., 2002).|$|R
50|$|The city of his birth, Chicago, and {{the city}} of much of his later life, New York, greatly {{influenced}} the composer. This is evident in the unpredictable rhythms and syncopation found in many of his works. Bazelon describes his music as having “the rebellious mutterings, cross-rhythms, and nervous tension and evergy of the city” and “the alerations of mood, color and dramatic flair are a direct expression <b>of</b> the constant <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> the rhythmic beat of life in the big metropolis”. His music rarely has easily recognizable melodies. When questioned regarding this, Bazelon stated, “My music is melodic, it is the melody of the 21st century”. Bazelon found inspiration from two main sources: city life and the racetrack.|$|R
