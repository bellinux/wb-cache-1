40|$|Harvard (A). A {{survey of}} the new {{administrative}} and curatorial organisation is given in Taxon 32 (1983) 704. Herbarium Pacificum (BISH). Since the renovation the collections {{have been placed in}} a specially designed <b>compactor</b> <b>system</b> for more easy access. There is now 43. 7 % more collection storage space while working space has increased by 51 %. Hereby the gifts of algae (± 68, 000 specimens) and mosses (± 22, 000) finally could be incorporated. A backlog of 20, 000 specimens was mounted. The renovation was made possible with ca. US$ 337, 000 provided by the NSF...|$|E
40|$|The Badger Explorer is a rig-less {{oil and gas}} {{exploration}} tool which drills {{into the}} subsea environment to collect geological data. Drill spoil is transported from {{the front end of the}} system to the rear, where the material is compacted. Motivated by the need to develop a highly efficient compaction system, an ultrasonic compactor for application with granular geological materials encountered in subsea environments is designed and fabricated as part of this study. The finite element method is used to design a compactor configuration suitable for subsea exploration, consisting of a vibrating ultrasonic horn called a resonant compactor head, which operates in a longitudinal mode at 20  kHz, driven by a Langevin piezoelectric transducer. A simplified version of the compactor is also designed, due to its ease of incorporating in a lab-based experimental rig, in order to demonstrate enhanced compaction using ultrasonics. Numerical analysis of this simplified <b>compactor</b> <b>system</b> is supported with experimental characterisation using laser Doppler vibrometry. Compaction testing is then conducted on granular geological material, showing that compaction can be enhanced through the use of an ultrasonic compactor...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} part of an ongoing project to enable the full {{specification}} of the Design Space for roller <b>compactor</b> <b>systems</b> and shows how the processing parameters influence the behaviour of the product granulate from a placebo formulation. Granulate was produced using a proprietary roller compactor by varying the compaction pressure and gap width, and the dynamic, bulk and shear properties of the resultant granulates were measured. The results demonstrate several rheological properties of the granulate, which {{have been shown to be}} closely correlated with variance in die filling and tablet strength, and are predictably influenced by the processing parameters...|$|R

50|$|Most {{polystyrene}} {{products are}} not recycled {{due to the}} lack of incentive to invest in the <b>compactors</b> and logistical <b>systems</b> required. As a result, manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap. Expanded polystyrene (EPS) scrap can easily be added to products such as EPS insulation sheets and other EPS materials for construction applications. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into clothes hangers, park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS.|$|R
40|$|Regenerative {{life support}} systems are vital for NASA's future long-duration human space {{exploration}} missions. A Heat Melt <b>Compactor</b> (HMC) <b>system</b> is being developed by NASA to dry and compress trash generated during space missions. The resulting water vapor is recovered and separated from the process gas flow by a gravity-insensitive condenser. Creare is developing a high-temperature condenser for this application. The entire condenser is constructed from metals that have excellent resistance to chemical attack from contaminants and is suitable for high-temperature operation. The metal construction and design configuration also offer greatest flexibility for potential coating and regeneration processes to reduce biofilm growth and thus enhancing {{the reliability of the}} condenser. The proposed condenser builds on the gravity-insensitive phase separator technology Creare developed for aircraft and spacecraft applications. This paper will first discuss the design requirements for the condenser in an HMC system that will be demonstrated on the International Space Station (ISS). Then, it will present the overall design of the condenser and the preliminary thermal test results of a subscale condenser. Finally, this paper will discuss the predicted performance of the full-size condenser and the development plan to mature the technology and enhance its long-term reliability for a flight system...|$|R
25|$|Most {{polystyrene}} {{products are}} currently not recycled {{due to the}} lack of incentive to invest in the <b>compactors</b> and logistical <b>systems</b> required. Due to the low density of polystyrene foam, it is not economical to collect. However, if the waste material goes through an initial compaction process, the material changes density from typically 30kg/m3 to 330kg/m3 and becomes a recyclable commodity of high value for producers of recycled plastic pellets. Expanded polystyrene scrap can be easily added to products such as EPS insulation sheets and other EPS materials for construction applications; many manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap because of collection issues. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into products such as clothes hangers, park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS. Currently, around 100 tonnes of EPS are recycled every month in the UK.|$|R
40|$|AbstractKolkata {{is one of}} {{oldest and}} largest {{metropolitan}} city in eastern part of India with population of 4, 486, 679 and population density of 24252 per km 2. The city of Kolkata generates almost 5500 ton of municipal solid waste (MSW) per day. The waste {{of the city is}} maintained by Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and around 80 % of this waste is collected by corporation waste management system KMC has introduced the Modern Scientific Waste Compacting Stations (MSWCS) under the Clean City initiative. The MSW thus collected were taken to the nearest compactor station which houses around two to five compactors depending upon the area, in total there are 90 compactors and 30 mobile compactors functioning till date. The number is expected to go up by the end of 2015 to 163 compactors at a cost of INR 152 crore. The previous method of dumping in open Vat was unhygienic and produced odor and vector born diseases in the vicinity and the people living near were largely affected. Though the addition of compactor has enhanced the cleanliness of the city but the sustainability of these waste compactors is a major issue and which is needed to be addressed. The disposal of the compacted waste is still being carried out in traditional landfill site and the landfill site and city distance being smaller raise a question on transportation savings which may have been incurred due to the compactor thus the payback period and long-term sustainability of the compactor is in question. The sustainability issues and challenges were identified based on a preliminary field study in 15 of the compactor station in Kolkata. The waste quantity, waste characteristics, number of trip of the compactors, labors requirements and number of other sustainability factors were evaluated. The data collected were benchmarked based on the literature, with the practices of other countries. The study reveals that there is number of issues which are lacking and needed to be implemented within the waste <b>compactor</b> management <b>system</b> to make the project sustainable in long run. The analysis revealed the need for a sanitized landfill site for methane extraction and segregation of waste before compacting for increasing the sustainability of the system. The studies finding if implemented can led to a more sustainable, economical and environmentally sound waste management system for the city of Kolkata. There are number of literature specific to waste management practices but specific study for waste compactor in a city and for Kolkata is unavailable in literature...|$|R
