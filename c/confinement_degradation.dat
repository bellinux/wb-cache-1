40|$|A {{history of}} land {{degradation}} is reconstructed {{in a part}} of the dividing ridge between the Great Fish and Keiskamma rivers, in Peddie District, former Ciskei. The study entails a comparative investigation of the progressive changes in land use, vegetation and soil erosion in three tenure units, namely: former commercial farms, traditional and betterment villages. Analysis of the sequential aerial photography of the area for 1938, 1954, 1965, 1975 and 1988 is employed. This is backed by groundtruthing exercises. Data thus obtained are quantified, and linkages between degradation, anthropogenic and physical factors are derived using PC ARC/INFO GIS. Differences in land tenure systems emerge as the main controlling factor to variations in land <b>degradation.</b> <b>Confinement</b> of vegetation diminution and erosion to traditional and betterment villages is observed at all dates. Scantily vegetated surfaces and riparian vegetation removal are a characteristic feature of both areas throughout the study period. 'Betterment,' introduced in the early 1960 s to curb land degradation is, instead observed to exacerbate it, particularly soil erosion. Trends in land use change are characterised by the abandonment of cultivated land, which is noted to coincide with a sharp rise in population. Erosion intensification into severe forms particularly between 1965 and 1975, coincident with a period of extreme rainfall events, emerges as the most significant degradation trend. A close spatial correlation between abandoned cultivated land and intricate gullies is identified. So is the case between grazing land and severe sheet erosion. Within the grazing lands, an examination of erosion and categories of vegetated surfaces reveals that erosion occurs predominantly on the scanty vegetation category. Such erosion-vegetation interaction largely explains the non-recovery of the scanty vegetation category, even during periods of intense rainfall. Extensive channel degradation is evident along stream courses with scanty riparian vegetation. Physical factors are noted to have a significant bearing on erosion. The high prevalence of erosion on the Ecca group of rocks confirms its erosion-prone nature. Pockets of colluvium and alluvium accumulation in the steep bottomlands are identified as the sites of the most severe gully erosion. Field surveys at some of the sites indicate that a dolerite sill through the area forms a boundary of colluvium accumulation and the upslope limit to gully incision. That these sites are recognised as formerly cultivated land, portrays the interaction between physical and anthropogenic variables with regard to inducing degradation in the area...|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} is presented {{of the impact}} of recent magnetohydrodynamic research results on performance projections for reactor-scale tokamaks as exemplified by the ITER Final Design Report facility. For nominal ELMy H-mode operation, the presence and amplitude of neoclassical tearing modes governs the achievable b-value. Recent work finds that the scaling of b at which such modes onset agrees well with a polarization drift model, with the consequence that, with reasonable assumptions regarding seed-island width, the mode onset b will be lower in reactor-scale tokamaks than in contemporary devices. <b>Confinement</b> <b>degradation</b> by such modes, on the other hand, depends on relative saturated island size which is governed by principally by b and secondarily by n *-effects on bootstrap current density. Relative saturated island size should be comparable in present and reactor devices.

40|$|The {{design value}} for ITER {{is based on}} {{operation}} at n/n(GW) = 0. 85, beta(n) = 1. 8 and H 98 (y, 2) = 1. These values have been routinely achieved in JET in argon seeded ELMy H-mode discharges in different divertor configurations and with different triangularities. Two main scenarios are emerging from the experiments. First, low triangularity (delta(u) = 0. 19) in septum configuration. In this case large D- 2 fuelling rates lead to <b>confinement</b> <b>degradation</b> towards L-mode. The seeding of Ar during the D- 2 fuelling phase {{gives rise to a}} density close to the Greenwald value. After the switch-off of the D- 2 gas fuelling ('afterpuff ' phase), the confinement recovers to H- mode quality whereas the density stays near the value reached {{at the end of the}} main fuelling phase and Z(eff) stays close to or below 2. Acting on the refuelling of Ar and D- 2 in the 'afterpuff 'phase allows us to improve the stationarity of the high performance phase while maintaining up to the end of the heating phase the good confinement, density and radiation level. Second, high triangularity (delta(u) = 0. 45) in vertical target configuration. In this case large fuelling rates do not lead to strong <b>confinement</b> <b>degradation</b> and the D- 2 fuelling is applied continuously throughout the discharge. A radiated power fraction of up to 70 %, H 98 (y, 2) = 0. 9 at beta(n) = 2. 1 and n = 1. 15 n(GW) -together with the formation of a radiating mantle and moderate Z(eff) -are achieved in this scenario.

40|$|Biocontamination in {{confined}} manned habitats poses a {{risk for}} the health of the crew and for the on-board equipment. The reduced immune response of humans that are exposed to extreme environmental conditions, like during long-term <b>confinement,</b> and the <b>degradation</b> capacities of some microorganisms call for continuous monitoring of biocontamination, and measures to mitigate it. Prevention includes taking the acquired knowledge into account for future habitat design. The MARS 500 project represented a unique opportunity to gain insight into the microbial distribution and its community structure during a long period of time. MARS 500 is the first full duration simulation of a manned flight to Mars, accomplished from June of 2010 to November of 2011. The six-man crew lived, worked, and performed scientific experiments in a closed spacecraft-like environment. The scientific experiment MICHAm (MIcrobial ecology of Confined Habitats and humAn health, modified) aimed to survey the microbial flora in the MARS 500 facility from the start {{to the end of the}} simulation study (520 days), and to investigate the impact of confinement. Therefore, the microbial load and biodiversity in the air and on surfaces as well as their changes over time were monitored. The determination of cultivable microorganisms showed that the overall microbial load in the air and on different surfaces was moderate compared to other non-confined rooms (air: 0 to 716 CFU per m³ with an average value of 86 CFU per m³; surface: 0 to 29, 760 CFU per 10 m² with an average value of 675 CFU per 10 cm²). The highest number of microorganisms was found in the air of the habitable module, where the crew members spent most of their time. This corresponds roughly to the results obtained from surfaces at certain locations. During the project, fluctuations in microbial load were detected. Those were analyzed in more detail by taking into account the crew activities in the different modules, the cleaning regimes, the air conditioning processes, et cetera. However, none of the single parameters revealed a significant influence, thus it is assumed that the combination of all of them led to the site- and time-specific contamination levels. Phylogenetic investigations indicated a higher diversity in surface samples than in air samples. Dominance of microorganisms associated with humans, especially Staphylococcus species, was observed on surfaces and in the air. Environmental microorganisms, mainly spore-forming bacilli, were found to a lesser extent. Besides cultivation-based analyses, the microbial inventory was also studied on the molecular level via DNA isolation, 16 S rRNA gene specific amplification, and subsequent PhyloChip analysis, to quantitatively measure the microbiome of two modules of the MARS 500 facility. The findings were surprising since the whole microbiome structure exhibited no significant influence for factor time, with the exception of a few taxa. However, significantly different microbiome structures were identified for both investigated modules, whereas the intragroup dissimilarity among samples was greater in the utility module than in the habitable module. Furthermore, by applying both cultivation and molecular methods, a deeper understanding of the microbiota and microbiome was obtained that also unveiled potentially pathogenic organisms (e. g. Staphylococcus sp., Propionibacterium sp., Enterococcus sp., and many more) and microbes with degradative capacities (e. g., Pseudomonas sp., Micrococcus sp., Bacillus sp., Acinetobacter sp., Flavobacterium sp., Escherichia sp., and Actinomyces sp.). However, the majority of microorganisms were not harmful, but belonged to the group of microbes that are even highly valuable to humans. During no point of the confinement study there was any alert and health concern due to potential danger caused by microorganisms. The scientific information obtained in this thesis is essential to evaluate biosafety risks, predict and mitigate the possible occurrence of biocorrosion, and improve the sanitary and hygienic quality of life for the crew inside closed habitats...|$|R

40|$|Tearing mode {{formation}} after internal crash {{events like}} sawteeth or fishbones {{is one of}} the most important MHD processes that results in a big island structure and associated <b>confinement</b> <b>degradation.</b> The process implies magnetic reconnection at the rational surface, which has been investigated in great detail in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak. Using direct local measurements, it is found that the crash leads to the formation of an ideal kink mode with large saturated amplitude at the resonant surface immediately after the sawtooth crash. This kink mode transforms into a tearing mode on a much longer timescale than the crash itself. The ideal kink mode, formed at the resonant surface after the crash, provides the driving force for the magnetic reconnection.

40|$|The {{conjecture}} {{that the}} safety factor profile, q(r), controls {{the improvement in}} tokamak plasmas from poor confinement in the Low (L-) mode regime to improved confinement in the supershot regime has been tested in two experiments on the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR).

40|$|Performance-limiting {{magnetohydrodynamic}} (MHD) instabilities on ASDEX Upgrade are discussed. In {{the conventional}} H-mode scenario, the main MHD performance limitation {{is found to}} be the neoclassical tearing mode (NTM). The onset beta of NTMs in ASDEX Upgrade scales with the poloidal ion gyroradius, in agreement with theoretical expectations. At higher beta values, NTMs occur in a more benign form, the frequently-interrupted-regime NTMs, which lead to a smaller <b>confinement</b> <b>degradation</b> than normal NTMs. Active control of NTMs by electron cyclotron current drive in the island has been demonstrated on ASDEX Upgrade. In advanced tokamak regimes with reversed shear, a variety of performance-limiting instabilities has been observed. The shear reversal zone can be unstable to double tearing modes or to infernal modes; both have been identified in ASDEX Upgrade. Due to the broad current profile in advanced tokamak discharges, the ideal external kink mode can be unstable at relatively low beta(N) {{less than or equal to}} 2; this is a main limitation to strongly reversed shear discharges with peaked pressure profiles.

The basic two-fluid processes, {{related to}} the nonlinearly self-consistent {{diamagnetic}} drifts of the electrons and ions, are shown to have fundamentally different effects on the steady state and beta limits of stellarator configurations, compared to MHD predictions. Nonlinear numerical simulation shows that the ideal MHD ballooning modes and the resistive MHD ballooning and interchange modes at relatively high mode numbers, that set the most severe theoretical limits on beta in stellarators with fixed boundary, are easily stabilized by two-fluid effects at realistic parameters, including finite Larmor radius effects {{related to the}} ion diamagnetic drift. Magnetic reconnection at low-order rational magnetic surfaces, on the other hand, is enhanced through the parallel component of the two-fluid electron pressure gradient in Ohm’s law. The accelerated reconnection rates may impose the true intrinsic limit on beta in stellarators, as a “soft ” or confinement mediated limit due to steady <b>confinement</b> <b>degradation</b> {{in the presence of}} large magnetic islands.

Therefore the q= 2 NTMs are much more detrimental to the confinement than the 3 / 2 modes since (ρq= 2 /ρq= 3 / 2) 3 ~(0. 8 / 0. 6) 3 ~ 2. 4. NTMs are metastable in typical scenarios with βN> 1 and in the region where dq/dρ> 0 [1]. This {{is due to the fact}} that the local pressure gradient is sufficient to self-sustain an existing magnetic island. The main questions for burning plasmas are whether there is a trigger mechanism which will destabilize NTMs, and what is the best strategy to control/avoid the modes. The latter has to take into account the main aim which is to maximize the Q factor, but also the controllability of the scenario. In this paper we present different aspects of the above questions, in particular the role of partial stabilization of NTMs, the possibility to control NTMs at small size with little electron cyclotron heating (ECH) power and the differences between controlling NTMs at the resonant surface or controlling the main trigger source, that is the sawteeth...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{favorable}} {{results on}} the START experiment have caused renewed interest in the potential of low aspect ratio tokamaks. To aid in designing a next-step spherical tokamak to study confinement scaling, high beta, and high normalized beta plasmas for minimal cost, the authors have developed a transport scaling and device optimization code. This code STOP, benchmarked against START, includes 10 empirical confinement scaling laws and essential tokamak physics such as stability limits. Parameters are optimized separately for each scaling law and physical goal. Using STOP the authors find for R/a = 1. 2 to 2. 0 one can achieve {beta}{sub N} = 5, ({beta}) = 31 [...] 44 %, and easily study predicted <b>confinement</b> <b>degradation</b> with auxiliary heating with just two neutral beams (P{sub NB} < 3. 5 MW) for I{sub p} {ge} 0. 75 MA, and R{sub 0 } {ge} 0. 6 m. In contrast, if one insists on using the nominal device parameters, i. e. I{sub p} = 1 MA and R{sub 0 } = 0. 8 m, with each scaling law, achieving {beta}{sub N} = 5 requires typically P{sub NB} {approx} 7. 5 MW.

40|$|At TEXTOR, an O-mode {{heterodyne}} reflectometer {{system is}} installed and operated for {{the measurement of}} plasma density fluctuations and turbulence investigations. With two antenna arrays in the equatorial and top positions having two and three horn antennae, respectively, poloidal correlations are investigated under different plasma scenarios. From the amplitude, cross-phase and coherency spectrum, differences in the ohmic and auxiliary heated discharges are investigated. Furthermore the dynamic behaviour of the turbulence is studied in the SOC-IOC transition and in the precursor phase of a disruption. For the latter an increased integrated power spectral density was observed at the X-point of the mode compared with the O-point. Stationary m = 2 mode activity is observed {{for the first time}} at TEXTOR by reflectometry. The fluctuation level is calculated for different conditions and rises significantly increasing heating power which is consistent with the L-mode <b>confinement</b> <b>degradation.</b> Correlation measurements yield the measured phase delays which are used to calculate the poloidal phase velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field. In ohmic plasmas the turbulence rotates like a 'rigid body' with constant angular velocity inside the q = 2 surface. The rigid body rotation is broken up during tangential neutral beam injection. From the deduced poloidal wavenumber of the turbulence, most likely ion temperature gradient modes are the driving mechanism of the turbulence...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Neoclassical tearing modes (NTMs) are {{magnetic}} islands which increase locally the radial {{transport and}} therefore degrade the plasma performance. They are self-sustained by the bootstrap current perturbed by the enhanced radial transport. The <b>confinement</b> <b>degradation</b> {{is proportional to}} the island width and to the position of the resonant surface. The q= 2 NTMs are much more detrimental to the confinement than the 3 / 2 modes due to their larger radii. NTMs are metastable in typical scenarios with βN> 1 and in the region where the safety factor is increasing with radius.

40|$|Abstract. As the {{reference}} operating regime for ITER, {{investigations of the}} ELMy H-mode have received high priority in the JET experimental programme. Recent experiments have concentrated in particular on operation simultaneously at high density and high confinement using high field side (HFS) pellet launch. The enhanced fuelling efficiency of HFS pellet fuelling is found to scale favourably to a large machine such as JET. The achievable density of ELMy H-mode plasmas in JET has been significantly increased using HFS fuelling although {{at the expense of}} <b>confinement</b> <b>degradation</b> back to L-mode levels. Initial experiments using control of the pellet injection frequency have shown that density and confinement can simultaneously be increased close to the values necessary for ITER. The boundaries of the available ELMy H-mode operational space have also been extensively explored. The power necessary to maintain the high confinement normally associated with ELMy Hmode operation is found to be substantially higher than the H-mode threshold power. The compatibility of ELMy H-modes with divertor operation acceptable for a fusion device has been studied. Narrow energy scrapeoff widths are measured which place stringent limits on divertor power handling. Deuterium and tritium codeposition profiles are measured to be strongly in/out asymmetric. Successful modelling of these profiles requires the inclusion of the (measured) scrape-off layer flows and of the production in the divertor of hydrocarbon molecules with sticking coefficients below unity. Helium exhaust and compression are found to be within the limits sufficient for a reactor. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Tokamak plasmas {{become less}} {{tolerant}} to externally applied non-axisymmetric magnetic “error” fields as beta increases, {{due to a}} resonant interaction of the non-axisymmetric field with a stable n = 1 kink mode. Similar to observations in low beta plasmas, the limit to tolerable n = 1 magnetic field errors in neutral beam injection heated H-mode plasmas {{is seen as a}} bifurcation in the torque balance, which is followed by error field driven locked modes and severe <b>confinement</b> <b>degradation</b> or a disruption. The error field tolerance is, therefore, largely determined by the braking torque resulting from the non-axisymmetric magnetic field. DIII-D experiments distinguish between a resonant-like torque, which decreases with increasing rotation, and a nonresonant-like torque, which increases with increasing rotation. While only resonant braking leads to a rotation collapse, modeling shows that non-resonant components can lower the tolerance to resonant components. The strong reduction of the error field tolerance with increasing beta, which has already been observed in early high beta experiments in DIII-D [R. J. La Haye, et al., Nucl. Fusion 32, 2119 (1992) ], is linked to an increasing resonant field amplification resulting from a stable kink mode [A. H. Boozer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 5059 (2001) ]. The amplification of externally applied n = 1 fields is measured with magnetic pick-up coils and seen to increase with beta, with the increase accelerating above the no wall ideal MHD stability limit, where the ideal MHD stable kink mode converts to a kinetically stabilized resistive wall mode. The beta dependence was no...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, recent {{results on}} the physics of neoclassical tearing modes (NTMs) {{achieved}} on ASDEX Upgrade are reported. A scaling law for NTM decay has been found, showing that the minimum local bootstrap current density required for mode growth {{is proportional to the}} ion gyro radius. As this scaling law does not depend on the seed island size, and thus on the background MHD activity, it is more reliable than previously derived scaling laws for the NTM onset. Furthermore, the recently reported frequently interrupted regime is discussed. In this new regime (m,n) NTMs are characterized by frequent amplitude drops caused by interaction with (m+ 1, n+ 1) background MHD activity. Due to the resulting reduced time averaged island size this leads to lower <b>confinement</b> <b>degradation</b> compared to that caused by the usual NTMs. As shown here, the transition into this regime can actively be triggered by lowering the magnetic shear at the q = (m+ 1) /(n+ 1) rational surface. Further investigations regard mechanisms to increase the β N value for NTM onset such as plasma shaping, seed island size and density profile control. Using these studies, a scenario with high β N (β N = 3. 5) at high density (n/n GW = 0. 83) and confinement (H 98 (y, 2) = 1. 2) has been developed. Moreover, this scenario is characterized by type II ELM activity and thus by moderate heat load to the target plates. Finally, new NTM stabilization experiments are reported, demonstrating an increase in β N after NTM stabilization...|$|E
