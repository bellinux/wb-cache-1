30|$|Diversification. This is {{the current}} {{spontaneous}} orientation of Soqotran pastoralists as practitioners of the `patching-up' ethic, which privileges a strategy of diversification over intensification. This strategy entails the straddling of the hinterland subsistence economy and the urban-based modern economy through working as full- or part-time participants in non-traditional jobs with a regular salary that is not contingent on the seasons. The cash earned in the modern economic sector is ploughed back into the pastoral domain, which they {{do not intend to}} abandon - while not expecting it to provide more than a subsistence income either. The motivation is to preserve their herds, to satisfy their passion for milk, and to secure their individual or <b>collective</b> <b>claim</b> over their territorial domain in the hinterland.|$|E
40|$|The growing {{international}} {{responsiveness to}} the rights of victims materialised in 2005 in the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for the Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of international Humanitarian Law (BPGs). Their analysis leads to a nuanced conclusion. On the one hand, the BPGs significantly contribute to strengthening victims' rights, as they adopt a victim-oriented perspective and provide a structured enunciation of their rights. They may inspire the African human rights system and national states in the development of their jurisprudence and policy on remedies. On the other hand, the expert text has been substantially weakened during the intergovernmental consultations. In some aspects, the BPGs even fall short of their intention to uphold international standards. Looking at the instrument through indigenous peoples' eyes unveils some specific deficiencies. Particularly regrettable is the reluctance of states to incorporate provisions concerning collective rights, whereas it is essential for indigenous peoples to be able to file a <b>collective</b> <b>claim</b> and receive reparation collectively. The challenges for the future lie first, in the implementation of the BPGs within national legal systems and second, in a further strengthening of the international norms on victims' rights, preferably by working towards a binding convention on the rights of victims of all human rights violations...|$|E

The article firstly offers a theoretical framework for precariousness, conceptualized as an interweaving and a co-construction of working and existential conditions. We then describe the most salient regulatory aspects of the academic labour market in Italy, in order to contextualize our research findings within the Italian University system. The research was conducted between 2014 and 2015 in two departments situated in the northeast of the country, the first belonging to the STEM field and the second to SSH disciplines. Thirty-two {{interviews were conducted with}} postdoctoral research fellows who, {{at the time of the}} research, worked, or had recently ended their collaboration, within the two departments under study. The section dedicated to the presentation of findings is focused firstly on the issue of invisibility of precarious researchers, declined both in terms of gender differences, and of the different level of recognition of postdocs’ working activities in the STEM compared to the SSH department. Secondly, attention is paid to the status of postdocs, on their complicated positioning between formal and informal work and on their substantial exclusion from social protection. In the concluding section, our contribution put in dialogue the individual experiences analysed within the case study with recent movements developed at the national level by precarious researchers, which focus precisely on a <b>collective</b> <b>claim</b> about the issues of recognition of work and access to welfare...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{attempts to}} scope the multiple and complex relationships between {{measures to protect}} health {{and the protection of}} human rights. The article begins with a discussion of the meaning and current understandings of the notion of ‘public health’, after which it explores how ‘public health’ is framed in various branches of public international law, including international trade law, the law of armed conflict and international environmental law. Subsequently, in light of these developments, it discusses whether the ‘right to health’ {{can be used as a}} <b>collective</b> <b>claim</b> to advance the health of the public, possibly in support of the existing public health clauses under international law. In such cases the protection of public health, and potentially the ‘right to health’, may clash with the interests of international and domestic trade and commerce, intellectual property protection, and the conduct of warfare. Another tension exists where measures to protect the health of the public infringe on the civil and political rights of individuals, including their rights to privacy and freedom of movement, but also their individual right to healthcare. This may occur both within and beyond healthcare settings, for example when it comes to quarantine, (forced) testing, and border restrictions in the interests of public health, but also in the fields of biomedical research and the testing of medicines. The existing limitation clauses under civil and political human rights law provide some guidance as to how such measures should be taken, however there is a need for a better understanding on how to implement these tools...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the concept of law and urban {{development}} {{with a focus on}} property rights and land, exploring the potential collective rights in the public domain to underpin a more equitable approach to the management of public space and challenge inappropriate regulation that criminalizes the lives of the poor. The focus is on street trade and the informal economy. The hypotheses are that: collective use rights extend to public land and are crucial to the livelihoods of the urban poor; such use provides public good as well as private profit, and legal traditions in sub-Saharan Africa can often accommodate the broad definition of rights entailed. The literature review interrogates debates on property rights, legal empowerment, and public space, to suggest that urban public space should be considered as a common resource where open access remains. Fieldwork draws on comparative studies of Dakar, Senegal, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, based on in-depth interviews with street traders and key informants, and a legal review in each city. The findings suggest very different trajectories in each city. In Dakar collective action with political support has created space for dialog, while in Dar es Salaam lack of solidarity among traders meant that evictions were uncontested. In both cities the balance between public and private gain was moderated through complex social processes to create the hybrid space of the street, defined here as a ‘collective pool resource’. Finally the paper explores bundles of rights that might include access and beneficial use but with collective management to establish such a ‘collective pool resource’. Thus the paper challenges the usual conception of the public domain as state land, to recognize the <b>collective</b> <b>claim</b> for the street that is core to the operation of urban informal economies...|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} the first {{in-depth}} academic discussion of the key aspects of the enhanced collective redress mechanisms introduced recently in relation to competition law infringements in the UK by the Consumer Rights Act. The legislation is a particularly significant development because of the historical and contemporary focus on the ‘consumer’ {{at the heart of}} competition/antitrust law and because the reforms also reflect more recent debates generally in legal practice about ‘access to justice’. The article first recounts the pivotal role played by ‘class actions’ in US antitrust enforcement before outlining the recent debate on encouraging and facilitating private enforcement in the EU, particularly in relation to collective redress, culminating in the (anodyne) Commission Recommendation of June 2013. As the article notes, most of the collective redress mechanisms introduced across the EU Member States to date have been opt-in models, but these have been criticised for their limited impact and effectiveness, and an opt-out representative model has been introduced in some Member States and discussed in others. The article will reflect on the limited provision in the UK on collective redress in relation to competition law infringements prior to the Consumer Rights Act, in particular the limitations in the opt-in follow-on procedure under s 47 B of the Competition Act 1998, as demonstrated by CA v JJB. The article will then focus on the Act’s provisions (and associated Tribunal rules) in relation to opt-in/opt-out collective proceedings and settlements (in both follow-on and stand-alone actions). The article will outline the new statutory provisions in sections 47 B and 49 A and B of the Competition Act 1998, for Collective Proceedings and Collective Settlements respectively. The Tribunal rules on certification will be considered, noting the potential difficulties in their practical application, before further analysis of two key problematic aspects of the proposed opt-out collective redress scheme, which may limit its effectiveness and uptake. The first concerns the appointment of the class/settlement representative and the second concerns the potential funding arrangements in relation to opt-out collective proceedings. The article questions whether the combination of these two aspects may dis-incentivise and unnecessarily limit the effectiveness of the new opt-out provisions, although it is accepted that this will also greatly depend on the Competition Appeal Tribunal interpretation and application of its new Tribunal Rules in relation to Collective proceedings, in particular regarding certification, appointment of the class/settlement representative and determination of the appropriate costs and expenses incurred in pursuing a <b>collective</b> <b>claim...</b>|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} {{excellent}} academic research, {{not only on}} diaspora, but also on postconflict Bosnia and Herzegovina in regards to transitional justice and peacebuilding. However, the factors that play a role vis-à-vis diaspora mobilization and transitional justice have been explored less. Theorizing has been ad hoc. Thus, the guiding question of this thesis is: How do diaspora utilize the political environments in their hostlands when they mobilize towards issues of transitional justice, in what ways and why? I develop a typological theory of diaspora mobilization, focusing on transitional justice claims, to systematize understanding and to develop midrange level explanations. Four types of diaspora mobilization (engaged, involved, reactive, and inactive) are theorized based on three independent variables: citizenship regimes, <b>collective</b> <b>claims,</b> and {{the presence or absence}} of ‘translocalism’ within diaspora communities. In particular, the more open citizenship regimes are, the higher the potential for diaspora mobilization will be. The thesis builds on the idea of translocal communities being an important factor in helping to determine the level of diaspora mobilization, along with the presence of <b>collective</b> <b>claims</b> in relation to transitional justice processes in the post-conflict homeland environment. The study is based on a qualitative research design using a unique two-level comparative lens, focusing on three countries in Europe (Sweden, France, and Germany) as well as four different cities within Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Prijedor, and Srebrenica). The research methods include semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and process tracing with multi-sited fieldwork. Thus, transnational, translocal, host country, and homeland influences are incorporated into analysis. The study provides comparative rigor to research on diaspora mobilization that is particular and rare. It establishes diaspora as an important actor to consider in transitional justice based efforts and provides a new perspective on the idea of translocalism...|$|R

30|$|The {{value of}} digital video as a data source and {{research}} tool in educational contexts is widely recognized (see for example Derry et al. 2010). For {{a majority of}} researchers working in classroom contexts, and across {{a wide spectrum of}} theoretical orientations, the use of video and video analysis is a given.

Thus, our goal in the work we present here is to contribute to the research literature that valorizes the use of video analysis in multilingual classroom contexts by drawing across our individual studies to make <b>collective</b> <b>claims</b> about the value of looking beyond the spoken and written to understand students’ meaning-making in science.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary focus}} {{of this article is to}} review the main {{obstacles}} in competition law enforcement in the European Union and to investigate how the development of collective redress could effectively facilitate enforcement of EU competition law. Arguably, antitrust enforcement remains sub-optimal due to the insufficient deterrent effect of EU antitrust fines and obstacles facing victims of competition law infringements in bringing damages actions. Central to my work, therefore, is the belief that collective actions constitute an attractive vehicle to solve, or at least diminish, the inefficienciesof antitrust enforcement. The paper explores some options as to how to design collective redress mechanisms in order to influence the ability to bring successful <b>collective</b> <b>claims.</b> This would, in turn, consider the advantages of opt-out collective actions in tackling the issues related to low participation rates, lack of funding and sub-optimal deterrence.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{mobilization of}} non-territorial groups {{raises questions about}} European states' {{ability to cope with}} <b>collective</b> <b>claims</b> that cannot be categorized under the traditional instruments of minority protection developed under the nation-state system.

Personal autonomy implies the introduction of the legal pluralistic paradigm and the selective opening of geo-legal frontiers to foreign legal traditions and institutions, as in Israel, the UK, and Germany. Cultural autonomy involves the devolution of competences to local minority self-government bodies and the involvement of minority members into decision-making organs vital to their interests, such as in Iraq, Estonia and Hungary.

40|$|As {{important}} aspects of purported tendencies toward globalization and pluralization, recent immigration waves and the resulting presence of culturally different ethnic minorities are often seen as fundamentally challenging liberal nation-states and traditional models of citizenship. According to this perspective, migrants and ethnic minorities contribute through their claims making both to the external erosion of sovereignty (the postnational challenge), and to the internal cultural differentiation of liberal nation-states (the multicultural challenge). In contrast, alternative theoretical approaches have emphasized the continuing relevance of the nation-state in the processes of inclusion and exclusion of minorities. From these three perspectives on citizenship (postnational, multicultural, and national) a set of hypotheses is derived and tested with data on the <b>collective</b> <b>claims</b> making of migrants and ethnic minorities in two European countries, Britain and Germany, for the period 1990 – 95.

Secondly, the homeowners’ class identity is reinforced and expressed through similar modes of consumption and lifestyle in their everyday life. Thirdly, based on living in the same residential area and similar consumption patterns and lifestyles, the middle class group identity is formed and enhanced through community interaction and participation. Their class identity has become the basis for social networking and <b>collective</b> <b>claims</b> within the gated community. In the process, their class identity is further reinforced through a sense of distinction vis-à-vis the working-class migrant workers who live in the same community as group tenants.
