40|$|Abstract Background Capsule related {{complications}} {{are common}} following pediatric cataract surgery. We report {{a new technique}} of multiple anterior capsulorhexisotomies after lens aspiration and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Methods After performing automated lens aspiration, an IOL was implanted into the capsular bag. A bent 26 gauge needle was introduced through one side port and multiple small cuts were made in {{one half of the}} circumference of the anterior capsular rim by making a radial movement of the needle tip centripetally over <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior capsular rim. The needle was again introduced through the other side port and multiple similar cuts were made in the other half thereby creating nearly 20 – 30 <b>cuts</b> at <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior capsular rim. Results The mean size of the primary capsulorhexis was 4. 33 ± 0. 20 mm. A uniform enlargement of the capsulorhexis could be performed in all the eyes without peripheral extension in any of the eyes. There was no damage to the posterior capsule and no scratch mark on the IOL. In one eye, the primary capsulorhexis was slightly eccentric, though it was covering the IOL optic all around. The rhexisotomies in this eye were limited to the capsular rim that was overlapping more on the IOL optic (sectoral anterior capsulorhexisotomies). Conclusion The technique of postage stamp anterior capsulorhexisotomies is a feasible technique in pediatric cataracts. </p...|$|R
50|$|Alokistocarids have an {{exoskeleton}} that is elongated ovate to inverted egg-shaped. The headshield (or cephalon) is semicircular and has {{a well-defined}} border. The central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is somewhat tapering forward, generally with 3 or 4 pairs of more or less distinct lateral furrows. The front of the glabella is rounded or truncate, and is separated from the border by a wide, moderately convex to flat (or rarely concave) so-called preglabellar field. Narrow ridges that connect the eyes with the glabella are well developed. The distance between the eye and the glabella (or palpebral lobe) is small. The fracture lines (or sutures) that in moulting separate the fixed from the free cheeks (fixigenae and librigenae) may converge or diverge in front of eyes. Behind <b>the</b> eyes they <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> posterior <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cephalon inside the inner bend of the genal spine (or opisthoparian sutures). The genal spines are short or moderately long. Alokistocarids have a relatively large articulating middle {{part of the body}} (or thorax), consisting of 12 to 19 segments. The thorax axis is moderately convex and sharply defined, while the areas lateral of the axis (or pleurae) are nearly flat with distinct grooves. The tailshield (or pygidium) is small, with few segments, and lacks a border. The surface is generally smooth.|$|R
30|$|The Ongeluk pillow lavas still retain open {{drainage}} cavities and interpillow voids. These {{are filled}} with quartz and/or jaspilite, which was likely precipitated penecontemporaneously with the interbedded jaspilite (Grobler and Botha 1976; Gutzmer et al. 2001, 2003). The precipitates in the drainage cavities have smooth, oval tubular shapes and are oriented parallel to the pillow tubes themselves or to the direction of lava flow. The cavities are isolated from one another and never cross-cut pillow rims nor do the precipitates in <b>the</b> voids ever <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> chilled <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> these rims. In {{the absence of such}} precipitates, the open spaces in volcanic rocks are obliterated by compaction during burial—strong evidence that these quartz precipitates formed relatively soon after eruption of the host volcanic rocks (Gutzmer et al. 2003). The jaspilite precipitates are composed mainly of microquartz and hematite and frequently form banded textures of red and white layers. The red layer consists of hematite and minor amounts of microquartz, magnetite, and pyrite, whereas the white layer comprises microquartz and larger subhedral andradite with subordinate hematite and disseminated calcite (Fig.  3 d, e), as previously reported (Gutzmer et al. 2001). As observed for the lavas, minor jaspilite samples exhibit deformation textures such as brecciation and/or calcite veining (Fig.  3 f). The formation temperature of these hydrothermal precipitates was estimated to be 64 – 160  °C from the homogenization temperature of fluid inclusions in the quartz (Gutzmer et al. 2001, 2003; Saito et al. 2016).|$|R

This study aimed the impact of rotary instruments upon fiber-matrix integrity, micromorphology and flexural-strength of glass-fiber posts (GFP). GFP (N= 110) were divided into 5 groups: Ctrl: as-received posts, DBc: coarse diamond-bur, DBff: extra-fine diamond-bur, CB: carbide-bur, DD: diamond-disc. Cutting procedures were performed under abundant irrigation. Posts exposed to rotary instruments were then subjected to 2 -point inclined loading test (compression 45 °) (n= 10 /group) and 3 -point flexural-strength test (n= 10 /group).

In this study, two independent migration assays were used to compare cellular motility on connective tissue components under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Human keratinocytes apposed to col-lagens or fibronectin exhibited increased motility when sub-jected to hypoxic (0. 2 or 2 % oxygen) conditions compared with normoxic (9 or 20 % oxygen) conditions. When compared with normoxic cells, hypoxic keratinocytes exhibited increased expression and redistribution of the lamellipodia-associated proteins (ezrin, radixin, and moesin). Furthermore, hypoxic keratinocytes demonstrated decreased secretion of laminin- 5, a laminin isoform known to inhibit keratinocyte motility. Hy-poxia did not alter the number of integrin receptors on the cell surface, but did induce enhanced secretion of the 92 -kD type IV collagenase. These data demonstrate that hypoxia promotes human keratinocyte motility on connective tissue. Hypoxia-driven motility is associated with increased expres-sion of lamellipodia proteins, increased expression of col-lagenase and decreased expression of laminin- 5, the loco-motion brake for keratinocytes. ...|$|R

In {{the northern}} areas, the {{main sources of}} hydrocarbon productivity are from biogenic gas reservoirs located in Quaternary thick deltaic depositional systems related to the Apennine and Dinaric foreland domain. In addition, Mesozoic thermogenic oil plays were identified and exploited in the Southern areas. Herein, we use basin and petroleum systems modelling (BPSM) techniques to investigate the still unproved thermogenic hydrocarbon potential of deep Mesozoic basins in the North Adriatic Sea and to correlate the results with the sedimentary evolution of proven petroleum systems in the Central and South Adriatic, both in the Italian and Croatian offshore areas.

40|$|The present case shows {{a case of}} fracture-redislocation of the hip {{caused by}} a {{depressed}} fracture of the femoral head similar to a Hill-Sachs lesion. A 59 -year-old man fell from a roof and his left hip joint was dislocated posteriorly. He was admitted to a nearby hospital, and he was referred to our hospital more than 24 hours after injury.

The sparse population is concentrated in Builth Wells, Llangammarch Wells and Llanwrtyd Wells, situated in the broad belt of undulating low ground, that divides the district from north-east to south-west along the course of the River Irfon. To the north-west of this tract, lies the dissected upland plateau of the Cambrian Mountains.

40|$|Background: This article aims to {{describe}} histopathologic high risk tumor characteristics {{in our patient}} population of retinoblastoma. It is based on consensus criteria for definitions of choroidal and optic nerve invasion as outlined in The International RetinoblastomaStaging Working Group (IRSWG) 2009. Materials and Methods: Fifty histopathologically diagnosed cases of retinoblastoma were archived from records of Pathology department during years 2004 to 2014. Re-evaluation of slides to identify choroidal and optic nerve invasion as per IRSWG along with Pathologic tumor staging was done. Data were entered into Microsoft excel sheets and results expressed in percentages. Department of Ophthalmology was consulted for recurrence of Retinoblastoma. Results: Among fifty cases, Choroidal invasion was absent in 62 % cases. Minimal invasion ( 3 mm) in 14 % cases and extra ocular involvement in 6 % cases. The optic nerve was free of tumor {{in more than three}} forth of the cases (78 %). Prelaminar and retro laminar involvement of optic nerve was observed in 6 % and 10 % cases respectively. Intraocular spread of tumor was observed in 6 % <b>of</b> cases. <b>The</b> <b>cut</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> optic nerve was involved in 42 % while it was free of tumor in 58 % of cases. Significant number of tumours were pathologically classified as pT 1 (58 %) followed by pT 2 a (22 %). pT 3 a and pT 4 b were found in 6 % each and pT 3 b and pT 4 a were found in 4 % each. Recurrence was observed in two cases of PT 3 a and one of pT 4 b. Conclusion: We conclude identifying low percentages of high risk charateristics in a retrospective histologic experience with Retinoblastoma. Recurrence observed in two tumours staged pT 3 a sheds light on prognostic significance of reporting massive choroidal invasion despite free cut margin. These observations call for routine practice of standardized histopathologic reporting and processing of enucleated eye samples at our tertiary care centre.

40|$|The Jahani Salt Diapir (JSD), with {{an area of}} 54 km 2, is {{an active}} diapir in the Simply Folded Belt of the Zagros Orogeny, {{in the south of}} Iran. Most of the {{available}} studies on this diapir are focused on tectonics. The hydrogeology, schematic model of flow direction and hydrochemical effects of the JSD on the adjacent water resources are lacking, and thus, are the focus of this study. The morphology of the JSD was reevaluated by fieldwork and using available maps. The physicochemical characteristics of the springs and hydrometric stations were also measured. The vent of the diapir is located 250 m higher than the surrounding glaciers, and covered by small polygonal sinkholes (dolines). The glacier is covered by cap soils, sparse trees and pastures, and contains large sinkholes, numerous shafts, several caves, and 30 brine springs. Two main groups of caves were distinguished. Sub-horizontal or inclined stream passages following the surface valleys and vertical shafts (with short inlet caves) at the bottoms of nearly circular blind valleys. Salt exposure is limited to steep slopes. The controlling variables of flow route within salt diapirs are the negligible porosity of the salt rocks at depth more than about ten meters below the ground surface and the rapid halite saturation along the flow route. These mechanisms prevent deep cave development and enforce the emergence points of brine springs with low flow rates and small catchment area throughout the JSD and above the local base of erosion. Tectonics do not affect karst development, because the distributions of sinkholes and brine springs show no preferential directions. The type of spring water is sodium chloride, with a TDS of 320 g/l, and saturated with halite, gypsum, calcite and dolomite. The water balance budget of the JSD indicates that the total recharge water is 1. 46 MCM (million cubic meter) /a, emerges from 30 brine springs, two springs from the adjacent karstic limestone, and flows into the Firoozabad River (FR) and the adjacent alluvium aquifer. <b>The</b> FR <b>cuts</b> through <b>the</b> northern <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> salt diapir, dissolving the glacier salts at the contact with JSD, increasing the halite concentration of the 17. 7 MCM/a of the FR from 100 mg/l to 12, 000 mg/l. This is a permanent process because the active glacier flows rapidly down the steep slopes into the river gorge from the nearby vent. The possible relocation of the FR channel would enhance the FR water quality, but disrupt the natural beauty of the diapir...|$|R
40|$|The Colca-Majes and Cotahuasi-Ocona {{rivers in}} {{southwest}} Peru that <b>cut</b> through <b>the</b> western <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Andean plateau {{en route to}} the Pacific Ocean incised canyons over 3 km deep in response to late Cenozoic surface uplift. This latest uplift represents a fundamental shift in the style and magnitude of surface deformation that had been ongoing since at least late Cretaceous time, but only relatively recently created what represents the only major barrier to atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere. Studying canyon incision history as a proxy for surface uplift offers a promising route to understanding how climate and tectonics have interacted throughout the evolution of the Central Andean plateau. In this thesis, a combination of bedrock low-temperature thermochronology (apatite and zircon (UTh) /He techniques), 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of valley-filling volcanic flows, and three-dimensional thermal modeling using a modified version of Pecube were applied to investigate the incision history of the rivers. Results suggested between 2. 6 and 3. 0 km of incision occurred in the deepest reaches of the canyons starting at ca. 10 to 11 Ma and ending between 2. 3 and 3. 5 Ma. The onset of surface uplift that is likely to have driven incision probably did not precede incision by more than one million years, although incision may have continued long after surface uplift ceased. The magnitude and timing of uplift that we infer is in broad agreement with uplift documented along <b>the</b> western <b>margin</b> in northern Chile, in the interior of the Andean plateau, and <b>the</b> eastern <b>margin.</b> Additional work on the style of structural accommodation of this uplift provide important context for interpreting what potential geodynamic mechanisms may have been responsible for this latest tectonic activity. Structural mapping revealed an early history of predominantly reverse fault activity that probably generated the first significant topography in the Central Andes. This compressional period was succeeded by a phase of longwavelenth warping deformation and normal kinematic movement on high-angle faults. (cont.) This later activity appears to have continued through the latest phase of uplift documented through river incision history, hence was likely responsible for accommodating uplift. Given the broadly synchronous timing of late Cenozoic uplift across the Andean plateau and the style of structural accommodation documented on <b>the</b> western <b>margin,</b> two possible geodynamic mechanisms appear most feasible for generating this latest phase of uplift: lithospheric delamination, and redistribution of ductile material through mid- to lower-crustal flow. Our initial studies of coastal uplift suggest that each is likely to have played a role, although additional work is required to understand how important each may have been in generating uplift. by Taylor F.
