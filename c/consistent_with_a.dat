5|$|A trial {{assembly}} of the Gadget without the active components or explosive lenses {{was carried out by}} the bomb assembly team headed by Norris Bradbury at Los Alamos on July 3. It was driven to Trinity and back. A set of explosive lenses arrived on July 7, followed by a second set on July 10. Each was examined by Bradbury and Kistiakowsky, and the best ones were selected for use. The remainder were handed over to Edward Creutz, who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material. This test brought bad news: magnetic measurements of the simultaneity of the implosion seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and reported that they were <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> perfect explosion.|$|E
5|$|At the 2001 UK census, the Middlewich wards of Cledford and Kinderton {{had a total}} {{population}} of 13,101. Middlewich's population is relatively young; the proportion of children (aged 0–15) is 3% {{higher than the national}} average. Households are larger than average, <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> younger population, with an average of 2.51 people per household, compared to the national average of 2.36. Approximately 25% are single person households, compared to 30% nationally; the majority (almost 85%) of Middlewich's housing stock is owner-occupied.|$|E
5|$|Cerro Blanco {{is part of}} the Central Volcanic Zone and {{is located}} at the {{southern}} limit of the Puna. It forms a volcanic unit together with the Aguada Alumbrera ignimbrite, at {{the eastern edge of the}} Cordillera de San Buenaventura. Rocks beneath this unit include dacitic–trachyandesitic volcanites 9–7 mya old and an igneous-metamorphic granitic basement containing orthogneiss, quartz of Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic age, containing paleozoic mafic to ultramafic volcanic inclusions. The Cordillera de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene–Quaternary age. During the Miocene-Pleistocene, the isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water-poor and unoxidized petrologies. This finding is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hot mantle forming after delamination of the crust and migration of the arc.|$|E

5|$|Fischer and {{co-workers}} also studied {{the chemistry of}} iridocene, the third transition series analogue of rhodocene and cobaltocene, finding the chemistry of rhodocene and iridocene are generally similar. The synthesis of numerous iridocenium salts including the tribromide and hexafluorophosphate have been described. Just as with rhodocene, iridocene dimerises at room temperature but a monomer form can be detected at low temperatures and in gas phase and IR, NMR, and ESR measurements indicate a chemical equilibrium is present and confirm the sandwich structure of the iridocene monomer. The complex , the analogue of rhodocene derivative reported by Fischer, has also been studied and demonstrates properties <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> greater degree of π-backbonding in iridium(I) systems than {{is found in the}} analogous cobalt(I) or rhodium(I) cases.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson serendipitously {{discovered}} the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal {{in the microwave}} band. Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation {{was found to be}} approximately <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1978.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Audouin Dollfus of the Observatoire de Paris {{reported}} anomalous {{features on}} the floor of Langrenus crater using a one-meter (3.2-foot) telescope. While observations on the night of December 29, 1992, were normal, unusually high albedo and polarization features were recorded the following night that did not change in appearance over the six minutes of data collection. Observations three days later showed a similar, but smaller, anomaly in the same vicinity. While the viewing conditions for this region were close to specular, it was argued that the amplitude of the observations were not <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> specular reflection of sunlight. The favored hypothesis was that this was the consequence of light scattering from clouds of airborne particles resulting from a release of gas. The fractured floor of this crater was cited as a possible source of the gas.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study {{identifies}} parents' {{perceptions about}} children's {{development and the}} factors that influence these perceptions. For this purpose, a 15 -item questionnaire was elaborated and filled out by 1103 parents of grade one and two children. Results show that parents' perceptions are <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> emergent perspective in relation to this learning process, i. e. they think that in an informal way, their children learn several things at home regarding writing. It was also noted that parents of grade two children are further supportive of an emergent perspective than parents of grade one children an that the education level of the participant influenced their perceptions on learning to write. Therefore, the better educated parents (university level) showed perceptions more <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> emergent perspective as opposed to parents <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower education (college, high school or elementary school level). Results also indicate a difference between the fathers' and the mothers' answers, the mothers' answers being more <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> emergent perspective...|$|R

5|$|In a {{paper by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos {{evidence}} is shown {{for a possible}} bimodal distribution of the distances to the ascending nodes of the ETNOs. This correlation {{is unlikely to be}} the result of observational bias since it also appears in the nodal distribution of large semi-major axis centaurs and comets. If it is due to the extreme TNOs experiencing close approaches to Planet Nine, it is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> planet with a semi-major axis of 300–400 AU.|$|E
5|$|In the Aleutian Islands, {{a massive}} and {{unexpected}} disappearance of sea otters {{has occurred in}} recent decades. In the 1980s, the area was home to an estimated 55,000 to 100,000 sea otters, but the population fell to around 6,000 animals by 2000. The most widely accepted, but still controversial, hypothesis is that killer whales have been eating the otters. The pattern of disappearances is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rise in predation, {{but there has been}} no direct evidence of orcas preying on sea otters to any significant extent.|$|E
5|$|The subgenre has {{its origins}} in open world action {{adventure}} games popularized in Europe (and particularly the United Kingdom) throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The release of Grand Theft Auto (1997) marked a major commercial success for open-ended game design in North America, and featured a more marketable crime theme. But it was the popularity of its 3D sequel Grand Theft Auto III in 2001 {{that led to the}} widespread propagation of a more specific set of gameplay conventions <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> subgenre. The subgenre now includes many games from different developers all over the world where the player can control wide ranges of vehicles and weapons. The subgenre has evolved with greater levels of environmental detail and more realistic behaviors.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} form, {{adoption}} rates, and economic rationale for various mutual fund investment restrictions. A sample of U. S. domestic equity funds from 1994 to 2000 reveals systematic patterns in investment constraints, <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> optimal contracting equilibrium {{in the fund}} industry. Restrictions are more common when (i) boards contain {{a higher proportion of}} inside directors, (ii) the portfolio manager is more experienced, (iii) the fund is managed by a team rather than an individual, and (iv) the fund does not belong to a large organizational complex. Low- and high-constraint funds produce similar risk-adjusted returns, also <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> optimal contracting equilibrium...|$|R
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} often {{transform into}} extratropical cyclones {{at the end}} of their tropical existence, usually between 30° and 40° latitude, where there is sufficient forcing from upper-level troughs or shortwaves riding the Westerlies for the process of extratropical transition to begin. During this process, a cyclone in extratropical transition (known across the eastern North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans as the post-tropical stage), will invariably form or connect with nearby fronts and/or troughs <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> baroclinic system. Due to this, the size of the system will usually appear to increase, while the core weakens. However, after transition is complete, the storm may re-strengthen due to baroclinic energy, depending on the environmental conditions surrounding the system. The cyclone will also distort in shape, becoming less symmetric with time.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but {{the challenge was}} met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. In October 1944, Creutz moved to Los Alamos, where he became a group leader responsible for explosive lens design verification and preliminary testing. Difficulties encountered in testing the lenses led {{to the construction of}} a special test area in Pajarito Canyon, and Creutz became responsible for testing there. As part of the preparation for the Trinity nuclear test, Creutz conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon without nuclear material. This test brought bad news; it seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Hans Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and was able to report that the results were <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> perfect explosion.|$|E
5|$|Wright met Darwin in {{the early}} 1760s, {{probably}} through their common connection of John Whitehurst, first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when {{he stayed in the}} Darwin household for a week. The energy and vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary (Polly) Darwin impressed Wright. In the 1980s Eric Evans (National Gallery) suggested that Darwin is the figure in the left foreground who holds a watch. As this composed timekeeper is not consistent with Darwin's flamboyant character, {{it is more likely that}} this is Dr William Small. The attention to timekeeping fits with Dr Small's role as the social secretary for the Lunar circle. Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765, consistent with this being a meeting in 1767. The profile and wig of this figure are <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps more extremely, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} to be a glider or flyer, due to the limb proportions, particularly the elongated forelimbs. These are <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> animal <b>with</b> patagia, like <b>a</b> flying squirrel.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose that}} {{consumers}} purchase brands {{in part to}} construct their self-concepts and, in so doing, form self-brand connections.

Results from two studies show that brands <b>with</b> images <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ingroup enhance self-brand connections for all consumers, whereas brands with images that are <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> outgroup have a stronger negative effect on independent versus interdependent consumers. We propose that this differential effect is due to stronger self-differentiation goals for consumers with more independent self-concepts. We also find greater effects for more symbolic than for less symbolic brands. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc [...] ...|$|R
