40|$|Having short <b>changeover</b> <b>times</b> is {{becoming}} more and more important in manufacturing operations. Decreasing lot sizes, shorter lead times, lower inventories are all characteristics of lean production systems. A good changeover performance of the manufacturing equipment is a key enabler for this. In reality machine designs are not always made with a fast changeover capability in mind. So, production people are often forced to use IE techniques such as SMED (Single Minute Exchange of Die) to address this problem and reduce <b>changeover</b> <b>times</b> after equipment is put on the shop floor. There is clearly a need to incorporate fast changeover capabilities into the design of equipment. An initial set of guidelines has been established. However, several aspects of machine design which are primarily meant to reduce the <b>changeover</b> <b>times,</b> are also linked to the body of knowledge of Human Factors Engineering. A more HF friendly design also reduces the time and effort needed for changeovers. This paper investigates this relationship and shows this synergy...|$|R

Inhomogeneities are detected at up to 24 percent of the tested pixels with spatial extent varying with satellite <b>changeover</b> <b>times.</b> Nevertheless, the contiguous periods without inhomogeneities at <b>changeover</b> <b>times</b> are generally longer than 10 years. Although the inhomogeneities have measurable impact on the derived trends, these trends are similar to those observed in ground data and land surface reanalysis, with an average error less than 0. 003 cubic meters per cubic meter per year. These results strengthen the basis of using the product for long-term studies and demonstrate the necessity of homogeneity testing of multisatellite CDRs in general...|$|R
50|$|In a 2006 study Victoria L.

All times are approximate and vary from one person to another. In particular, there is no convenient way to accurately determine the times of the peaks and zero-crossings of these curves in an individual. Administration of light or melatonin close to the time at which the effect is expected to change sense abruptly may, if the <b>changeover</b> <b>time</b> is not accurately known, produce an opposite effect to that desired.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{automation}} means {{serial production}} with large batch sizes and limited flexibility. Complete automation lines are usually built up around a single product or possibly a small family of similar products that can {{run in the}} same production line. If a component is changed or if a complete new product is introduced, this usually causes large changes in the automation process-in most cases new component fixtures are required with time consuming set up procedures. If components are delivered to the process by traditional hoppers and vibrating feeders, new bowl feeder tooling or additional bowl feeder tops are required. It may be that different product must be manufactured on the same process line, the cost for pallets, fixtures and bowl feeders can often be {{a large part of}} the investment. Other areas to be considered are space constraints, storage of change parts, spare components, and <b>changeover</b> <b>time</b> between products.|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} {{performance}} optimization {{problem in a}} single-station multiclass queueing network with <b>changeover</b> <b>times</b> {{by means of the}} achievable region approach. This approach seeks to obtain performance bounds and scheduling policies from the solution of a mathematical program over a relaxation of the system's performance region. Relaxed formulations (including linear, convex, nonconvex and positive semidefinite constraints) of this region are developed by formulating equilibrium relations satisfied by the system, with the help of Palm calculus. Our contributions include: (1) new constraints formulating equilibrium relations on server dynamics; (2) a flow conservation interpretation of the constraints previously derived by the potential function method; (3) new positive semidefinite constraints; (4) new work decomposition laws for single-station multiclass queueing networks, which yield new convex constraints; (5) a unified buffer occupancy method of performance analysis obtained from the constraints; (6) heuristic scheduling policies from the solution of the relaxations.

5000|$|Common brands for {{commercial}} video mixers are Videonics. These pieces of hardware simply accept multiple video sources and combine them {{in various ways}} such as fades, wipes, {{and a number of}} other transitions. Another common piece of equipment in the DVJ arsenal is called a switcher. Most digital turntables, whether CD or DVD, have a fader-start capability, in which the cross-fader of the audio or video mixer can tell a player to pause or play. By using these types of switchers (the Pioneer A/V switcher is a very common example), scratching video effects can show the typical back-and-forth motion heard on audio. More-advanced video mixers also have a chroma-key capability, known by most as [...] "green screen" [...] compositing. Currently, Videonics makes a number of mixers that will allow for this effect. VJ artists may play DVD tracks with a certain color that is set as the chroma-key color on the mixer. The mixer will then locate this color on the track and replace it with whatever the VJ has chosen. Many times, he or she will use a camera and camera operator to take live video feeds of the dancing crowd and superimpose them on a video of something else to give a novel effect. A top end mixer option is the Pioneer SVM-1000, which has preview screens, switchers, video FX, and audio FX, all in a four-channel mixer. A standard setup can be the Pioneer DJM-800 with a VSW-1 Switch and a three-screen monitor. This kind of setup must have numerous media discs which must be transported to, or available at, the location. Swapping discs increases the <b>changeover</b> <b>time</b> for videos vs. a computer setup, and there's the possibility of skipping or stopping with scratched or damaged discs.|$|E
