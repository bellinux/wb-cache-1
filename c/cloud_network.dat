For this purpose, companies working on IoT collect data from multiple sources and store it in their <b>cloud</b> <b>network</b> for further processing. This leaves the door wide open for privacy and security dangers and single point vulnerability of multiple systems.

[...] The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions feature an increased 720p resolution and a [...] aspect ratio, providing a clearer and wider view of the player's surroundings compared to the original 480p resolution and [...] ratio of the PS2 version, while the PS Vita version runs at qHD resolution. Cutscenes can now be viewed in full-screen or letterboxed format, while online achievements/trophies have been added as well. Most of the additional content from Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance have also been ported in this version, such as the Missions and Snake Tales modes, although the Skateboarding minigame that was present in the PS2 version of Substance is absent. The PS3 and Vita versions have a [...] "transfarring" [...] option that allows players to transfer save data between both versions through a wi-fi connection or a <b>cloud</b> <b>network.</b> The Vita version has touch screen and touch pad support for certain gameplay functions such as switching between items and weapons or zooming into cutscenes.|$|E

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} delivers services over virtualized {{networks to}} many end-users. Cloud services {{are characterized by}} such attributes as on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid and elastic resource provisioning and metered services of various qualities. <b>Cloud</b> <b>networks</b> provide data as well as multimedia and video services. Cloud computing for critical structure IT is a relative new area of potential applications. <b>Cloud</b> <b>networks</b> are classified into private <b>cloud</b> <b>networks,</b> public <b>cloud</b> <b>networks</b> and hybrid <b>cloud</b> <b>networks.</b> Anomaly detection systems are defined as a branch of intrusion detection systems that deal with identifying anomalous events with respect to normal system behavior. A novel application of a Self-Organizing-Feature Map (SOFM) of reduced/aggregate sets of ordered vector structured features that are used for detecting anomalies {{in the context of}} secure cloud environments is herein proposed. Multivalue inputs consist of reduced/aggregate ordered sets of vector and binary features. The nodes of the SOFM - after training - are indicative of local distributions of feature measurements during normal cloud operation. Anomalies are detected as outliers of the trained SOFM. Each structured vector consists of binary as well as histogram data. The aggregated Canberra distance is used to order histogram data whereas the Jaccard distance is used for multivalue binary data. The so-called Cross-Order Distance Matrix is defined for both cases. The distance depends upon the selection of a similarity/distance measure and a method for operating upon the elements of the Cross-Order Distance Matrix. Several methods of estimating the distance between two ordered sets of features are investigated {{in the course of this}} paper...|$|R
40|$|The rising {{adoption}} of cloud computing and increasing interconnections among its actors {{lead to the}} emergence of network-like structures and new associated risks. A major obstacle for addressing these risks is the lack of transparency concerning the underlying network structure and the dissemination of risks therein. Existing research does not consider the risk perspective in a <b>cloud</b> <b>network’s</b> context. We address this research gap with the construction of a reference model that can display such networks and therefore supports risk identification. We evaluate the reference model through real-world examples and interviews with industry experts and demonstrate its applicability. The model provides a better understanding of <b>cloud</b> <b>networks</b> and causalities between related risks. These insights can be used to develop appropriate risk management strategies in <b>cloud</b> <b>networks.</b> The reference model sets a basis for future risk quantification approaches {{as well as for the}} design of (IT) tools for risk analysis...|$|R
