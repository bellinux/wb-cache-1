40|$|Purpose: (1) To {{quantify}} {{the effect of}} <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear on straylight in rigid and soft <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers and (2) to relate findings to morphological changes and subjective complaints. Methods: Straylight was measured using the Oculus C-Quant during <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear and after <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> removal in 30 rigid <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers and 30 soft <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers. Semi-quantitative (0 - 4) slit-lamp grading of anterior segment changes using Efron grading scales and <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> characteristics were performed. Subjects answered a straylight questionnaire. Results: Soft <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers had a mean straylight of logarithmic value of the straylight parameter [log(s) ] = 0. 934 during <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear and after <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> removal [comparable to log(s) = 0. 938 of age-matched normal eyes]. Rigid <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers had a mean straylight during <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear of log(s) = 1. 167. After <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> removal, log(s) significantly decreased to 0. 997 (P < 0. 01). Straylight values with rigid <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> were strongly increased (P < 0. 001) compared with age-matched normal eyes; after <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> removal, these values decreased but remained elevated. Straylight in rigid <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers correlated {{with the amount of}} deposits on the <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> (P < 0. 01) but not with other variables of the <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> score. The questionnaire showed more straylight complaints in rigid <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers than in soft <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: Rigid <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear leads to increased straylight during <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear and after <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> removal. This may be because of subclinical effects of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear on the cornea and is not seen in soft <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearer...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Microbial corneal {{infection}} {{is the most}} serious complication of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear. <b>Contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases are a recognised potential source of pathogens associated with corneal ulcers. METHODS [...] This survey established the incidence of protozoal, bacterial, and fungal <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case contamination in 101 asymptomatic daily wear cosmetic <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers from a domiciliary <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> practice. RESULTS [...] Eighty two (81 %) <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases were found to be contaminated, with 19 (19 %) sterile. Of all <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases, 78 (77 %) grew bacteria, 24 (24 %) fungi, and 20 (20 %) protozoa. Acanthamoeba spp were isolated from eight (8 %) <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases. Fifty six (55 %) <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases yielded mixed bacterial contamination. This is the first <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case survey in which hydrogen peroxide disinfection was the major method of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> disinfection (75 % of subjects) and no home made saline was used. All the contaminating organisms were shown to possess the enzyme catalase that breaks down hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water. The polymicrobial nature of the biofilms found in many <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases is illustrated electron micrographically. CONCLUSION [...] Based on data from this and previous studies, the authors conclude with recommendations for <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers: (1) regular scrubbing of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case interior to disrupt biofilms; (2) exposure of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case to very hot water (> or = 70 degrees C) will kill Acanthamoeba contaminants; (3) allow <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case to air dry between uses; (4) if hydrogen peroxide dis{{infection is}} preferred, use a two step system; (5) replace <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case regularly...|$|R

40|$|Keratoconus is {{the most}} common corneal distrophy. It’s a noninflammatory {{progressive}} thinning process that leads to conical ectasia of the cornea, causing high myopia and astigmatism. Many treatment choices include spectacle correction and <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear, collagen cross linking, intracorneal ring segments implantation and finally keratoplasty. <b>Contact</b> <b>lenses</b> are commonly used to reduce astigmatism and increase vision.

40|$|Objectives. To {{describe}} the past 20 years’ correction modalities for keratoconus and their visual outcomes and possible complications. Methods. A {{review of the}} published literature related to the visual outcomes and possible complications {{in the context of}} keratoconus management using nonsurgical procedures for the last 20 years (glasses and <b>contact</b> <b>lenses)</b> was performed. Original articles that reported the outcome of any correction modalities of keratoconus management were reviewed. Results. The most nonsurgical procedure used on keratoconus management is the <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> fitting. Soft <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> and soft toric <b>contact</b> <b>lenses,</b> rigid gas-permeable <b>contact</b> <b>lenses,</b> piggyback <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> system, hybrid <b>contact</b> <b>lenses,</b> and scleral and corneoscleral <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> form the contemporary range of available lens types for keratoconus management with <b>contact</b> <b>lenses.</b> All of them try to restore the vision, improve the quality of life, and delay surgical procedures in patients with this disease. Complications are derived from the intolerance of using <b>contact</b> <b>lens,</b> and the use of each depends on keratoconus severity. Conclusions. In the context of nonsurgical procedures, the use of <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> for the management of keratoconic patients represents a good alternative to restore vision and improve the quality of live in this population...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this survey}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of <b>contact</b> <b>lenses,</b> current prescribing habits of practitioners and the development of the <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> market in Hong Kong. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to all registered <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> practitioners in Hong Kong. This questionnaire sought information about their choices on prescribing <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> and lens care products and their opinions on continuing education and future trends of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> development. Results: A total of 286 responses (22 per cent) were returned. On average, the respondents reported that 36 per cent of their patients were <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers and most were myopes. The ratio of new fittings to refittings was 1 : 3. Of the <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers, 66 per cent were fitted with planned replacement lenses, mostly daily disposable lenses. Multipurpose solution was the most popular lens care regimen prescribed. Only 48 per cent of astigmatic patients were fitted with toric lenses and the use of overnight orthokeratology and silicone hydrogel lenses was limited. Single vision <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> with over-spectacles and monovision <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> were the most popular management for presbyopes. Dryness was the major problem reported by <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers. Practitioners look forward to further development of custom-made toric, multifocal and silicone hydrogel lenses. The major source of new <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> information was communication with <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> suppliers. Conclusion: Compared to previous reports, there was no significant change in the prescribing habits of practitioners. The major complaint of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers is still ocular dryness. The <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> market is driven by younger <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers, and planned replacement soft <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> together with multipurpose solutions dominate. The use of bifocal/multifocal lenses remained low and practitioners want low cost bifocal/multifocal <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> with better visual performance and toric lenses with a wider range in parameters. The use of overnight wear lenses such as silicone hydrogel and ortho-k lenses is limited and 30 days continuous wear silicone hydrogel lenses are prescribed mainly for daily wear.

40|$|Ocular {{discomfort}} and dryness during <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear {{are the main}} reasons for <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> intolerance. <b>Contact</b> <b>lenses</b> have potential to trigger tear film parameter alterations, similar to those seen in dry eye. Increased tear osmolality has been associated with {{discomfort and}} ocular surface changes in dry eye. This thesis investigated both the impact of tear film and <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality on ocular discomfort during lens wear and possible ways to modulate osmolality. Vapour pressure osmometry and freezing point depression osmometry were tested for measurement agreement for tears and solutions as well as for accuracy and repeatability. Both instruments proved to be valid for clinical studies, showing deviations in osmolality only for ocular lubricants, possibly caused by preservatives. Successful development and validation of a repeatable and lens parameter independent method for measuring the osmolality of worn <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> allowed testing of the relationship between comfort and tear and <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality. Reduced comfort was associated with elevated <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality but not with tear osmolality. <b>Contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality was associated with ocular characteristics such as corneal sensitivity changes and tear film break-up time as well as lens parameters, such as lens thickness and water content. Subsequent studies tested potential ways to alter <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality to improve comfort. Increasing tear volume using punctal plugs initially decreased <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality and improved comfort but the effect was lost in the long term, possibly due to a feedback mechanism between lacrimal drainage and production. Application of hypo-osmotic drops caused a small thought non-significant <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality decrease and comfort improvement. <b>Contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality may contribute to lens-associated discomfort and provide the link between observed tear film and ocular surface changes, lens characteristics and reported comfort. Modulation of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality via external factors showed partial improvement in ocular comfort and demonstrated the potentials of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality for improving comfort Associations between the osmolality of a worn <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> and its parameters shown in this thesis suggest that alterating lens material or shape parameters to modulate <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality may benefit lens comfort...|$|R

Streptococcus spp. (4. 23 %) were found in extended <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> and (3. 9 %) in disposable <b>contact</b> <b>lenses.</b> Escherichia coli (15. 49 %) were more in the extended <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> and were in higher proportion (14. 74 %) than the other microorganisms in all the <b>contact</b> <b>lenses.</b> Klebsiella spp. (12. 99 %) were more in the disposable lenses than in the extended wear lenses (12. 69 %). there were more disposable lenses (41. 56 %) with ‘no growth’. Amoebae were isolated from (6. 49 %) disposable and (4. 23 %) extended wear <b>contact</b> <b>lenses.</b> Seventeen (32. 69 %) DWCL had mixed flora. There were significant differences between disposable and extended <b>contact</b> <b>lenses,</b> p< 0. 05. ConclusionsEWCL present more microorganisms and pose threat to the users. DWCL had more amoebae, which calls for suitable lens care methods. Further studies may be needed {{to determine}} the level of care required for <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> users in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{document}} <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> prescribing {{patterns in}} the United States between 2002 and 2014. Methods A survey of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> prescribing trends was conducted each year between 2002 and 2014, inclusive. Randomly selected <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> practitioners {{were asked to provide}} information relating to 10 consecutive <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> fits between January and March each year. Results Over the 13 -year survey period, 1650 survey forms were received from US practitioners representing details of 7702 <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> fits. The mean (±SD) age of lens wearers was 33. 6 (± 15. 2) years, of whom 65. 2...|$|R
50|$|Reductions in {{epithelial}} {{oxygen uptake}} and thickness {{are thought to}} be caused by long-term <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear-induced hypoxia, which hinders epithelial metabolism and mitosis. Recovery of normal epithelial oxygen uptake can occur if <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear is completely halted for one month. Because long periods of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear are correlated with extended hypoxia, the resurgence of cellular growth and epithelial metabolism following <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> removal (and hence, improved oxygen circulation) leads to an initial, increased resurgence of microcysts containing cellular debris. Over time, however, microcysts will disappear if <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> are not worn.|$|R
