25|$|The 2600s {{shared the}} engines and {{transmission}} of their GNR(I) predecessors, having two , 9.6-litre, six-cylinder, four-stroke engines driving the inner axles {{of the two}} bogies via fluid flywheels and Self-Changing Gears five-speed preselector gearboxes, with <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> driving forward/reverse gearboxes {{on the ends of}} the axles. Multiple working was via 24-core jumper cables. The cars were fitted with two parallel vacuum brake systems—a conventional system and a second high-vacuum, quick-release system, based on reservoirs in which a vacuum was continually maintained, for use on services with frequent stops. Steam heating was originally fitted; even-numbered cars had a boiler in the guard's compartment, capable of supplying steam for up to four cars. Cars used on suburban services were subsequently fitted with a bus-type heating system that utilised the engines' cooling water.|$|E
2500|$|The A-4's four blade rotor {{was mounted}} {{at the top}} of a three legged pylon. [...] The two rear legs were based on the upper {{fuselage}} longerons and the forward on the upper central fuselage. They positioned the rotor hub directly over the wing centre line and [...] behind the centre of gravity. [...] The [...] rotor had blades with an aspect ratio of less than 14. [...] They were of mixed construction, with steel main spars, two wooden subsidiary spars and covered in a mixture of ply and fabric. Their section was the airfoil used by the Cierva C.19. The blades were wire braced from above from an extension of the rotor axis, which leaned forwards with respect to the aircraft's axis by 2°. [...] These wires were steel but contained rubber dampers. Hinges (double <b>Cardan</b> <b>shafts)</b> provided both upwards and in-plane movement, the latter damped by springs; normally such deflections were about ±7°.|$|E
50|$|In 1965 native {{locomotive}} production {{began to}} use <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> {{as part of the}} transmission system.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the special}} {{location}} and structure of transmission system on high-speed train named CRH 5, dynamic unbalance state of the <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> will {{pose a threat to}} the train servicing safety, so effective methods that test the <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> operating information and estimate the performance state in real time are needed. In this study a useful estimation method based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is presented. By using this method, time-frequency characteristic of <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> can be extracted effectively by separating the gearbox vibration acceleration data. Preliminary analysis suggests that the pinions rotating vibration separated from gearbox vibration by EEMD can be used as important assessment basis to estimate <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> state. With two sets gearbox vibration signals collected from the in-service train at different running speed, the comparative analysis verifies that the proposed method has high effectiveness for cardan-shaft state estimate. Of course, it needs further research to quantify the performance state of <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> based on this method...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is the {{creation}} of kinematic systems of the <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> in the CAD/CAM/CAE system CATIA V 5 and analysis of three cases of assembly to determine upon which, angular accelerations had been observed between the input driving <b>shaft,</b> central <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> and output driven shaft. The scientific result of this paper was to confirm the presence of cardan error and how this type of error can be successfully eliminated...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> {{are also}} {{often used in}} marine {{applications}} between the transmission and either a propeller gearbox or waterjet.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} has {{a diesel}} powertrain, using hydraulic transmission, with both bogies driven by <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts,</b> and all wheels powered.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> {{are used}} in some diesel {{locomotives}} (mainly diesel-hydraulics, such as British Rail Class 52) and some electric locomotives (e.g. British Rail Class 91). They are also widely used in diesel multiple units.|$|E
50|$|This {{arrangement}} was only fitted to one bogie, {{the other one}} retaining its normal drive but with the <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> disconnected.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> failure {{led to an}} {{incident}} at [...] on 10 April 2011, injuring {{a member of the}} public with a piece of ballast kicked up by the detached shaft.|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} Yhteissisu production {{was dependent on}} availability of German components; gearboxes and steering gears were from ZF, rims from Kronprinz, <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> from Rheinmetall and Bosch supplied electrical equipment. These were later replaced by number of domestic options. The gearboxes were produced by Rosenlew, electrical equipment came from Strömberg, Hackman & Co. made rims, Fiskars produced leaf springs, the engines were made by SAT and Tampereen Pellava- ja Rautateollisuus, of which the latter one produced also front axles. Valtion lentokonetehdas made cabins and <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts,</b> Valtion Tykkitehdas steering gears, rear axle housings and wheel hubs came from Ahlström, drive shafts from Lokomo and rubber parts, including tyres, from Suomen Gummitehdas.|$|E
5000|$|The B′B′ or B-B {{arrangement}} is similar, but usually applies to diesel-hydraulic locomotives rather than diesel-electrics. The axles on each bogie are coupled together mechanically, {{rather than being}} driven by individual traction motors. Diesel-hydraulics have their engine mounted on the main frame of the locomotive, together with a hydraulic transmission. Power is then transmitted to the bogies by <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> and a short driveshaft between axles.|$|E
50|$|A similar wheel arrangement, {{with five}} axles across two bogies, {{is also used}} in Japan for the Class DE10, DE11, and DE15 locomotives. As these are diesel-hydraulic locomotives, they are of C-B arrangement, not Co-Bo. A {{hydrodynamic}} transmission on the locomotive frame {{is driven by the}} prime mover, then drive to each bogie is taken by <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts.</b> The axles of each bogie are all driven, and all geared together, rather than having traction motors.|$|E
50|$|The power {{transmission}} is mechanical. It provides a constant transmission of torque {{from the engine}} to all the wheels. The {{power transmission}} comprises the following: gearbox, transfer box, wheel reducers, front and rear main transmissions, and <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{general design}} of a CR-8 {{locomotive}} was available in weights from 45 to 65 ST with installed power ranging from , using twin engines with hydraulic transmission via a <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> final drive, in gauges from [...] to [...]|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper presented here {{is to determine the}} relationships for describing the bending and torsional vibrations of long cardan drivelines and to compare the calculated results to the experimental results. The problem of the resonance of <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> drivelines means a considerable difficulty in the field of designing. Dynamic modelling could solve the problem by determining the natural frequency of the system. The load is dependent on the ratio of the natural frequency to the excitation frequency. Furthermore, the dynamic model is suitable for tuning/detuning the natural frequency. The parameters of the driveline (moment of inertia, bearing stiffness, shaft length, etc.) are the input data of the simulation model developed and the effects of changes can be determined. The driveline can be designed according to the results of the simulation of a flywheel location, bearing stiffness and <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> length. Location of the safety clutch, location and number of <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> bearings and the stiffness of bearings can be found out by the simulation model, as well. The results of the measurements performed with a test stand proved that resonance phenomenon did not occur with the Wühlmaus 2733 potato harvester during operating conditions. Therefore, the possible breakdown of some parts of the machine was caused probably by overloading and not by resonance...|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{variants of}} the standard MaK G1200 series design, and are considered a development of the MaK G1205 type. The locomotive is an off-centre cab design with a two-speed voith hydraulic transmission driving all axles via <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts.</b> Auxiliary electrical supply is provided by an engine mounted alternator. Unlike many other MaK locomotives which use a MTU or CAT 12-cylinder V engine the locomotive has an ABC 6-cylinder inline engine.|$|E
5000|$|Small {{shunting}} locomotives {{were assigned}} the number [...] "3". The second number indicates {{the engine power}} (according to 1955 standards). The third number differentiates between brakes and transmission (chain drive or <b>Cardan</b> <b>shafts).</b> Small locomotives of the former Ka series were given the new class numbers 381 (pre-war models) and 382 (new models). The existing narrow gauge locomotives of the Wangerooge Island Railway became Class 329. In 1987 the DB Class 260/261 were also assigned to the small locomotives and labelled as Class 360/361.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the series as {{fundamentally}} {{the same as the}} rest of the V 160 family: all four axles are driven via <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> by a Voith two speed hydraulic transmission which in turn is driven by a diesel engine, fuel and oil are located between the bogies under the main frame, on either side of the centrally located transmission, there are two cabs (which have slightly different windows). Externally the machines are very similar to the other members of the class, being of the longer variant at 16.4 m.|$|E
50|$|A drive shaft, driveshaft, driving shaft, {{propeller}} shaft (prop <b>shaft),</b> or <b>Cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> is a mechanical component for transmitting torque and rotation, usually used to connect other {{components of a}} drive train that cannot be connected directly because of distance or the need to allow for relative movement between them.|$|R
50|$|Only {{one type}} was made, a two-seater, {{and it is}} thought that only 14 were sold. The car was powered by a single cylinder, 1180 cc, 8 hp De Dion engine at the rear driving through a <b>Cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> which was unusual in those days when chain drive was more common.|$|R
50|$|The {{motorcycles}} {{were made}} in several models ranging from 98 cc two stroke to 750 cc overhead valve four cylinder engines. There were also one and two cylinder models, with a sheet metal frame and <b>Cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> final drive. Dollar made its own engines, but also used Chaise overhead valve engines.|$|R
50|$|In September 1944 Rheinmetall-Borsig {{became an}} {{external}} camp for Buchenwald concentration camp. As many as 1,294 female prisoners {{were made to}} do forced labour there, most of them aged between 16 and 60, many Jews from Hungary. As well as continuing to produce <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts,</b> the women also helped make parts for armoured vehicles used in the war, as well as manufacturing arms; two new workshops were built for this in 1944 and 1945. The SS evacuated the camp in early April 1945, sending its prisoners and SS overseers on a death march, which ended near Pilsen, Czechoslovakia.|$|E
50|$|In 2013 the PLA {{was able}} to obtain a set of Krauss Maffei trucks from a retired Plasser and Theurer ballast {{cleaning}} machine from France. In 2015, they purchased replacement <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> made by the Welte group in Germany. These two developments meant that if the rear Maybach could be made operational {{that it would be}} possible for SP 9010 to operate under its own power. On February 14, 2017, the rear MD870 Maybach V-16 diesel engine was successfully started after being unused for 48 years. It ran for about 16 minutes; the engine was turned off, then turned back on for 2 minutes with no problems both static runs, and with a clean exhaust. On March 1, 2017, SP 9010 operated under its own power for the first time, on the Niles Canyon Railway.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of track machines are {{powered by a}} diesel engine. This provides power to the driving wheels via either a hydrostatic circuit or <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft,</b> allowing the machine to propel itself to and around a work-site. The engine also drives a hydraulic pump to provide power for the various tools.|$|R
50|$|At {{each end}} {{there was an}} {{identical}} motor installation with Ford petrol engines, that drove the first axle via a four-geared drive and <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft.</b> Only the front motor facing the direction of travel was used and was operated by the driver's cab at that end. When shunting or if an engine failed, the railbus could also be driven in reverse.|$|R
50|$|All the {{vehicles}} were 2 axle bogieless designs {{with the exception}} of the original Tram number 101 which had a double bogie. No.101 was sold in 1916 to Erith Urban District Council. It was replaced by another Tram 101 delivered in 1923 which was an experimental design designed by the company's manager E S Rayner with <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> drive to split axles via a differential.|$|R
50|$|Double Cardan joints {{are similar}} to double <b>Cardan</b> <b>shafts,</b> except that {{the length of the}} {{intermediate}} shaft is shortened leaving only the yokes; this effectively allows the two Hooke's joints to be mounted back to back. DCJs are typically used in steering columns, as they eliminate the need to correctly phase the universal joints at the ends of the intermediate shaft (IS), which eases packaging of the IS around the other components in the engine bay of the car. They are also used to replace Rzeppa style constant-velocity joints in applications where high articulation angles, or impulsive torque loads are common, such as the driveshafts and halfshafts of rugged four wheel drive vehicles. Double Cardan joints require a centering element that will maintain equal angles between the driven and driving shafts for true constant velocity rotation. This centering device requires additional torque to accelerate the internals of the joint and does generate some additional vibration at higher speeds.|$|E
50|$|The A-4's four blade rotor {{was mounted}} {{at the top}} of a three legged pylon. The two rear legs were based on the upper {{fuselage}} longerons and the forward on the upper central fuselage. They positioned the rotor hub directly over the wing centre line and 96 mm behind the centre of gravity. The 13 m rotor had blades with an aspect ratio of less than 14. They were of mixed construction, with steel main spars, two wooden subsidiary spars and covered in a mixture of ply and fabric. Their section was the airfoil used by the Cierva C.19. The blades were wire braced from above from an extension of the rotor axis, which leaned forwards with respect to the aircraft's axis by 2°. These wires were steel but contained rubber dampers. Hinges (double <b>Cardan</b> <b>shafts)</b> provided both upwards and in-plane movement, the latter damped by springs; normally such deflections were about ±7°.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{consideration}} {{was given}} to placing both engines back-to-back {{at one end of}} the train, but concerns were raised over excessive buckling forces when pushing the train at high speeds with the tilt feature active. So, finally, the design team chose to place the engines back-to-back in the center of the train. The two engines would be identical and both would carry a pantograph to pick up power, but in normal operation only the rear of the two engines would raise its pan, and the other engine would be fed power through a coupling along the roof. Power was converted to direct current by ASEA thyristors, supplying four [...] DC traction motors mounted in each power car. The traction motors were moved from their former location in the car body to be mounted on the bogies, thereby reducing unsprung weight. The motors transmitted their power through internal gearboxes, <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> and quill final drives.|$|E
50|$|The {{transporters}} models feature similar configuration. Both {{units are}} basically sealed all-welded structures.The vehicle power plant is arranged {{in the first}} van behind the driver's cabin. From a 12-cylinder multi-fuel engine the torque is conveyed to a hydro-mechanical transmission via a <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> and further to the bevel gearing and final drive units, {{as well as to}} the drive sprockets of the first and second van bodies.|$|R
50|$|The main {{concept of}} the {{universal}} joint {{is based on the}} design of gimbals, which have been in use since antiquity. One anticipation of the universal joint was its use by the ancient Greeks on ballistae. In Europe the universal joint is often called the Cardano joint or <b>Cardan</b> <b>shaft,</b> after the Italian mathematician Gerolamo Cardano; however, in his writings, he mentioned only gimbal mountings, not universal joints.|$|R
50|$|The {{trainsets}} are 4-unit {{multiple units}} capable of operating in pairs, designed for medium-distance high-speed services. The inner axle of each carriage bogie {{is powered by}} a body mounted three phase asynchronous traction motor via a <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> final drive. The electrical power is regulated by IGBT devices with one converted per carriage. The bogies are of welded steel construction with primary coil springs and secondary air suspension. Tractive forces are transmitted by a drag pivot pin.|$|R
