40|$|<b>Cerebellar</b> <b>syndromes</b> {{are one of}} the commonest {{neurological}} diseases. Objectives: To {{study the}} patterns of clinical presentations of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>syndromes</b> and to identify the possible causes. Methods: This is a prospective hospital based, cross-sectional study. One hundred adult Sudanese patients with <b>cerebellar</b> <b>syndromes</b> were included in the study during the period from January 2006 – January 2007. Results: The most common age group affected was 18 – 25 years. Male to female ratio was 1. 5 : 1 unsteadiness on walking was the most common symptom (83 %). Gait-ataxia was the most common sign (83 %). Cerebrovascular disease was the most common aetiology (25 %). Conclusion: <b>Cerebellar</b> <b>syndromes</b> are not rare in Sudan. However, they were diagnosed more commonly at the central regions of the country probably because of more awareness of patients and better facilities for diagnosis. The age of onset, the male predominance, the presentation and clinical findings were not different from reported literature. This also goes for the common causes apart from alcohol which is a strikingly rare as a cause in this study and could be accounted for the implementation of Elshariya (Islamic laws) Laws in Sudan...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{view on the}} cerebellum as {{the sole}} coordinator of motor function has been substantially redefined during the past decades. Neuroanatomical, neuroimaging and clinical studies have extended {{the role of the}} cerebellum to the modulation of cognitive and affective processing. Neuroanatomical studies have demonstrated cerebellar connectivity with the supratentorial association areas involved in higher cognitive and affective functioning, while functional neuroimaging and clinical studies have provided evidence of cerebellar involvement in a variety of cognitive and affective tasks. This paper reviews the recently acknowledged role of the cerebellum in linguistic and related cognitive and behavioral-affective functions. In addition, typical <b>cerebellar</b> <b>syndromes</b> such as the <b>cerebellar</b> cognitive affective <b>syndrome</b> (CCAS) and the posterior fossa syndrome (PFS) will be briefly discussed and the current hypotheses dealing with the presumed neurobiological mechanisms underlying the linguistic, cognitive and affective modulatory role of the cerebellum will be reviewed. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Twenty eight {{patients}} with the clinical diagnosis of idiopathic late onset cerebellar ataxia were examined clinically and by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). In addition, the clinical records of all patients were analysed retrospectively. On {{the basis of their}} clinical presentation they were subdivided into {{patients with}} a pure <b>cerebellar</b> <b>syndrome</b> (n = 9) and patients with a <b>cerebellar</b> <b>syndrome</b> and additional non-cerebellar symptoms (n = 13). No attempts were made to classify patients with a disease duration of less than four years (n = 6) because the retrospective analysis showed that the disease started almost invariably with a pure <b>cerebellar</b> <b>syndrome</b> and additional symptoms came later. Patients with a lasting pure <b>cerebellar</b> <b>syndrome</b> had a significantly better prognosis than patients with additional non-cerebellar involvement (annual progression rate rate: 0. 40 versus 0. 80). Calculated median lifetime from onset of symptoms was 20. 7 years in patients with a pure <b>cerebellar</b> <b>syndrome</b> and 7. 7 years in patients with additional non-cerebellar symptoms. Among the latter, disease progression was faster the earlier non-cerebellar symptoms occurred. All of them presented with Parkinsonian symptoms, whereas bulbar symptoms, vertical gaze paresis, pyramidal deficits, dementia and urinary incontinence were encountered less frequently. MRI or CT showed cerebellar atrophy without apparent involvement of brainstem structures in all patients with a pure <b>cerebellar</b> <b>syndrome</b> suggesting the diagnosis of cerebellar cortical atrophy (CA). The majority of the patients with additional non-cerebellar symptoms had evidence of an atrophy of the cerebellum and the brainstem suggesting the presence of olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophy (OPCA).

40|$|BACKGROUND: This report {{highlights}} {{the differential diagnosis}} of predominant cerebellar white matter abnormalities with dentate nuclei involvement. PATIENT DESCRIPTION: We describe two individuals with Langerhans cell histiocytosis in whom the diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was initially considered. The clinical picture consisted of a progressive <b>cerebellar</b> <b>syndrome</b> with typical magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities. In both individuals, the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>syndrome</b> preceded the diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: The magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities and neurological features in patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis can be strikingly similar to those with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. In cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, the cerebellar symptoms and cerebellar white matter abnormalities are usually seen in adult patients. In a pediatric patient with a <b>cerebellar</b> <b>syndrome,</b> showing these cerebellar white matter abnormalities a diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis is more likely...|$|E

40|$|Cerebellar lesions {{can cause}} motor deficits and/or the <b>cerebellar</b> {{cognitive}} affective <b>syndrome</b> (CCAS; Schmahmann's syndrome). We used voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping {{to test the}} hypothesis that the <b>cerebellar</b> motor <b>syndrome</b> results from anterior lobe damage whereas lesions in the posterolateral cerebellum produce the CCAS. Eighteen patients with isolated cerebellar stroke (13 males, 5 females; 20 – 66  years old) were evaluated using measures of ataxia and neurocognitive ability. Patients showed a wide range of motor and cognitive performance, from normal to severely impaired; individual deficits varied according to lesion location within the cerebellum. Patients with damage to cerebellar lobules III–VI had worse ataxia scores: as predicted, the <b>cerebellar</b> motor <b>syndrome</b> resulted from lesions involving the anterior cerebellum. Poorer performance on fine motor tasks was associated primarily with strokes affecting the anterior lobe extending into lobule VI, with right-handed finger tapping and peg-placement associated with damage to the right cerebellum, and left-handed finger tapping associated with left cerebellar damage. Patients with the CCAS in the absence of <b>cerebellar</b> motor <b>syndrome</b> had damage to posterior lobe regions, with lesions leading to significantly poorer scores on language (e. g. right Crus I and II extending through IX), spatial (bilateral Crus I, Crus II, and right lobule VIII), and executive function measures (lobules VII–VIII). These data reveal clinically significant functional regions underpinning movement and cognition in the cerebellum, with a broad anterior-posterior distinction. Motor and cognitive outcomes following cerebellar damage appear to reflect the disruption of different cerebro-cerebellar motor and cognitive loops...|$|R

40|$|Bordetella {{pertussis}} (BP), {{the agent}} of whooping cough, has not been recognized so far {{as a cause of}} permanent cerebellar ataxia in human. We describe three patients who developed a disabling and permanent <b>cerebellar</b> <b>syndrome</b> soon after whooping cough. In two patients, diagnosis of BP infection was confirmed by culture of nasopharyngeal secretions. The infection occurred between the age of 13 and 15 years, with neurological symptoms beginning after a delay varying from 3 weeks to 3 months. In our three patients, the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>syndrome</b> was characterized by dysmetria of ocular saccades, scanning speech and ataxic gait. Brain MRI demonstrated a pancerebellar atrophy. The pathogenesis of this cerebellar degeneration is not established. Experimental studies have demonstrated that the cerebellum is particularly vulnerable to lymphocytosis-promoting factor (LPF), one of the exotoxins from BP. The mechanism of this toxicity might be a marked increase in the cellular levels of 3 ', 5 'cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).

The major toxic effects of HDARAC are restricted to the bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, and nervous system. The neurologic toxicity of HDARAC ranges from a mild peripheral neuropathy to an acute cerebral and <b>cerebellar</b> <b>syndrome</b> that may be fatal.
