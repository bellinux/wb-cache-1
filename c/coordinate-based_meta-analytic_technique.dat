We aimed to conduct a <b>coordinate-based</b> <b>meta-analytic</b> research through systemic review on voxel-based morphometry (VBM) imaging results to identify consistent gray matter (GM) difference between FMS patients and healthy subjects. We performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed (January 2000 –December 2015) and included six VBM publication on FMS. Stereotactic data were extracted from 180 patients of FMS and 123 healthy controls. By means of activation likelihood estimation (ALE) technique, regional GM reduction in left medial prefrontal cortex and right dorsal posterior cingulate cortex was identified. Both regions are within the default mode network. In conclusion, the gray matter deficit {{is related to the}} both affective and nonaffective components of pain processing.

40|$|Spatial normalization—applying {{standardized}} coordinates as anatomical addresses {{within a}} reference space—was introduced to human neuroimaging research nearly 30 years ago. Over these three decades, an impressive series of methodological advances have adopted, extended, and popularized this standard. Collectively, this work has generated a methodologically coherent literature of unprecedented rigor, size, and scope. Large-scale online databases have compiled these observations and their associated meta-data, stimulating {{the development of}} meta-analytic methods to exploit this expanding corpus. <b>Coordinate-based</b> <b>meta-analytic</b> methods have emerged and evolved in rigor and utility. Early methods computed cross-study consensus, in a manner roughly comparable to traditional (nonimaging) meta-analysis.

40|$|According to {{a recent}} meta-analysis, {{religious}} priming has {{a positive effect on}} prosocial behavior (Shariff et al., 2015). We first argue that this meta-analysis suffers from a number of methodological shortcomings that limit the conclusions that can be drawn about the potential benefits of religious priming. Next we present a re-analysis of the religious priming data using two different <b>meta-analytic</b> <b>techniques.</b> A PET-PEESE meta-analysis suggests that the effect of religious priming is driven solely by publication bias. In contrast, an analysis using Bayesian bias correction suggests the presence of a religious priming effect, even after controlling for publication bias. These contradictory statistical results demonstrate that <b>meta-analytic</b> <b>techniques</b> alone may not be sufficiently robust to firmly establish {{the presence or absence of}} an effect. We argue that a conclusive resolution of the debate about the effect of religious priming on prosocial behavior – and about theoretically disputed effects more generally – requires a large-scale, preregistered replication project, which we consider to be the sole remedy for the adverse effects of experimenter bias and publication bias...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the kinds of}} analytic techniques {{that have led to}} conclusions concerning differences in the cognitive performance of men and women. It begins with a description of the derivation of different measures of effect size and the potential hazards in using <b>meta-analytic</b> <b>techniques.</b> In turn the likelihood of biases occurring in the publication of research, in the sampling of participants, and in the sampling of test items, and the issue of the possible heterogeneity of research studies, especially with regard to their methodological quality are assessed.

Nevertheless, the conclusion that the ideas, arguments, and evidence lead to a rather different, constructionist interpretation, and that as a consequence future research into gender differences in human cognition will need to address a wider range of research questions using a wider range of research methodologies is presented...|$|R

The use of effect magnitude measures with surrounding confidence intervals and indications of the reliability of the study are recommended for individual research studies.

40|$|Psychological {{contract}} perceived breach (PCB) {{has become}} a prominent factor in the empirical research of organizational psychology, and {{has been used to}} predict a broad range of individual and organizational outcome variables. However, not all results are consistent, nor do they show relationships in the same direction, as there are important variations both in the size and in the sign of the relationships between PCB and the attitudes and behaviours of the people exposed to them. The number of empirical studies attempting to evaluate the existence of PCB has increased steadily during the last few years. Nevertheless, no quantitative review has been conducted to assess the strength and generalizability of these relationships. Our research attempts to fill this gap using <b>meta-analytic</b> <b>techniques</b> to summarize the relationships between PCB and important outcome variables. The absence of previous meta-analyses is not the only reason for concern. There is the additional issue of the overall evaluation of the effect size (ES) of PCB. This issue has not been dealt with in the literature. Moreover, based on the fruitful results of meta-analysis obtained in many research domains (Topa, Depolo, & Morales, 2007), it can be beneficial to use <b>meta-analytic</b> <b>techniques</b> and SEM (Structural equation modelling) in testing causal models, such as some authors suggested (Viswesvaran &...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{of animals}} often report a greater {{sensitivity}} of one sex to poor rearing environments. However, {{it is unclear}} whether size differences associated with sex, sex itself, or other factors are responsible for differences in performance. While the greater nutritional requirement of the larger sex is a plausible explanation for increased sensitivity (i. e., size-dependent vulnerability), other hypotheses suggest that size-independent traits may have effects on the fitness of offspring (i. e., sex-dependent vulnerability). For example, the heterogametic sex may be more vulnerable to expression of sex-linked recessives in poor environments, or sex-specific phenotypes may have negative effects (e. g., increased testosterone in males). We examined support for these hypotheses through the use of <b>meta-analytic</b> <b>techniques</b> based on the published literature on avian species. Our results revealed small, nonsignificant effects for hypotheses of size- and sex-dependent susceptibilities alone. Application of a multivariate <b>meta-analytic</b> <b>technique</b> (meta-regression) suggests a joint influence of sexual size dimorphism and clutch size in explaining sex-specific patterns of vulnerability. These findings suggest that none of the proposed hypotheses tested here on their own can sufficiently explain the observed patterns and that additional factors must be considered in order to explain the diversity of patterns of sex-specific sensitivity observed in the literature...|$|R

40|$|The right {{inferior}} frontal cortex (rIFC) {{is frequently}} activated during executive control tasks. Whereas {{the function of}} the dorsal portion of rIFC, more precisely the inferior frontal junction (rIFJ), is convergingly assigned to the attention system, the functional key role of the ventral portion, i. e., the inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), is hitherto controversially debated. Here, we used a two-step methodical approach to clarify the differential function of rIFJ and rIFG. First, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a modified stop signal task with an attentional capture condition (acSST) to delineate attentional from inhibitory motor processes (step 1). Then, we applied <b>coordinate-based</b> <b>meta-analytic</b> connectivity modeling (MACM) to assess functional connectivity profiles of rIFJ and rIFG across various paradigm classes (step 2). As hypothesized, rIFJ activity was associated with the detection of salient stimuli, and was functionally connected to areas of the ventral and dorsal attention network. RIFG was activated during successful response inhibition even when controlling for attentional capture and revealed the highest functional connectivity with core motor areas. Thereby, rIFJ and rIFG delineated largely independent brain networks for attention and motor control. MACM results attributed a more specific attentional function to rIFJ, suggesting an integrative role between stimulus-driven ventral and goal-directed dorsal attention processes. In contrast, rIFG was disclosed as a region of the motor control but not attention system, being essential for response inhibition. The current study provides decisive evidence regarding a more precise functional characterization of rIFC subregions in attention and inhibition...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} the sub-classification of renal cortical neoplasms using molecular signatures. Experimental Design: A search of publicly available databases was performed to identify microarray datasets with multiple histologic sub-types of renal cortical neoplasms. <b>Meta-analytic</b> <b>techniques</b> were utilized to identify differentially expressed genes for each histologic subtype. The lists of genes obtained from the meta-analysis were used to create predictive signatures {{through the use of a}} pair-based method. These signatures were organized into an algorithm to sub-classify renal neoplasms. The use of these signatures according to our algorithm was validated on several independent datasets. Results: We identified three Gene Expression Omnibus datasets that fit our criteria to develop a training set. All of the datasets in our study utilized the Affymetrix platform. The final training dataset included 149 samples represented by the four most common histologic subtypes of renal cortical neoplasms: 69 clear cell, 41 papillary, 16 chromophobe, and 23 oncocytomas. When validation of our signatures was performed on external datasets, we were able to correctly classify 68 of the 72 samples (94 %).
