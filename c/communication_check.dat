40|$|Radiotherapy, {{with close}} to a million courses {{delivered}} per year in North America, is a very safe and effective intervention for a devastating disease. However, although rare, several deeply regrettable incidents have occurred in radiotherapy and have rightly {{been the subject of}} considerable public interest. Partly in response to reports of these incidents a variety of authoritative organizations across the globe has harnessed the expertise amongst their members in attempts to identify the measures that will make radiotherapy safer. While the intentions of all these organizations are clearly good it is challenging for the health care providers in the clinic to know where to start with so much advice coming from so many directions. Through a mapping exercise we have identified commonalities between recommendations made in seven authoritative documents and identified those issues most frequently cited. The documents reviewed contain a total of 117 recommendations. Using the 37 recommendations in Towards Safer Radiotherapy as the initial base layer, recommendations in the other documents were mapped, adding to the base layer to accommodate all the recommendations from the additional six documents as necessary. This mapping exercise resulted in the distillation of the original 117 recommendations down to 61 unique recommendations. Twelve topics were identified in three or more of the documents as being pertinent to the improvement of patient safety in radiotherapy. They are, in order of most to least cited: training, staffing, documentation, incident learning, <b>communication,</b> <b>check</b> lists, quality control and preventive maintenance, dosimetric audit, accreditation, minimizing interruptions, prospective risk assessment and safety culture. This analysis provides guidance for the selection of those activities most likely to enhance safety and quality in radiotherapy based on the frequency of citation in selected recent authoritative literature...|$|E

40|$|Aim To {{identify}} whether {{intensive treatment}} and aftercare telephone contacts influence long-term abstinence {{and well-being of}} patients with alcohol dependency. Methods Six hundred and twenty two patients were evaluated {{at the beginning and}} end of intensive in-patient treatment. At the end of the treatment, the patients were divided into two recruitment cohorts – telephone contact group (n = 347), in whom basic outcome criteria (abstinence, marital and employment status, self-evaluation of well-being) were evaluated 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after intensive treatment and no contact group (n = 275) in whom the basic outcome criteria were checked only at 24 months after the intensive treatment. At 24 months, response rate was 33. 4 % in telephone contact group (n = 116) and 30. 5 % (n = 84) in no contact group. Results Positive indicators of therapy success (abstinence or decrease in drinking, stabile social relations, and more positive self-evaluation of well-being) were found in 53. 0 % of patients at 3 months, 44. 3 % at 6 months, and 30. 6 % at 12 months in telephone contact group. Overall abstinence 24 months after the end of intensive treatment was reported in 25. 7 % of all patients, including non-respondents. Both groups achieved significant improvement in subjective well-being during intensive treatment. At 24 months, 3 attributes of subjective well-being (subjective psychological health, evaluation of financial status, general quality of life) were significantly higher in telephone contact group. However, groups did not significantly differ in the abstinence level (telephone contact group = 27. 7 %, no contact group = 24. 4 %). Conclusion Significant differences in well-being variables between telephone contact group and no contact group at 24 months after the end of intensive treatment are at least partially due to phone contact/informative checking 3, 6, and 12 months after the end of intensive therapy.
