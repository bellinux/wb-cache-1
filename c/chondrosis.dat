50|$|The {{occurrence}} of subsequent surgical procedures (SSPs), primarily arthroscopy, following ACI is common. For example, in the Study of the Treatment of Articular Repair (STAR), 49% of Carticel ACI patients underwent an SSP on the treated knee, during the 4-year follow up. The most common serious adverse events (up to 5% of patients), include arthrofibrosis and joint adhesions, graft overgrowth, chondromalacia or <b>chondrosis,</b> cartilage injury, graft complication, meniscal lesion, graft delamination, and osteoarthritis.

40|$|Background: Patients {{with chronic}} {{ruptures}} of 1 or both cruciate ligaments {{in combination with}} posterolateral rotatory instability of the knee often have some degree of cartilage damage {{at the time of}} surgery. Hypothesis: <b>Chondrosis</b> at the time of reconstruction does not influence early and intermediate functional outcome of the multiple ligament reconstructed knee. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Twenty-one patients were available from an original 27 treated between 1995 and 2000. All patients were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively by physical examination and by applying 4 different knee rating scores. All patients were assessed at a mean follow-up of 39 months (range, 14 – 75 months) and 87 months (range, 62 – 123 months). Results: At the first follow-up, all knee rating scores had improved significantly (P <. 0003) compared with preoperatively; 84 % of the reconstructed knees had normal to nearly normal laxities according to the International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 score. At the second follow-up, the functional scores remained significantly (P <. 0089) better than preoperatively. Patients with <b>chondrosis</b> at the time of surgery did not have significantly different knee rating scores at the first follow-up compared with patients without cartilage damage. Four years later, the results in the <b>chondrosis</b> group were significantly worse (P <. 05) for all knee rating scores compared with the patients without <b>chondrosis.</b> The results in 3 of 4 knee rating scores declined significantly in the <b>chondrosis</b> group over the 48 -month interval between follow-up sessions. In the Tegner and Lysholm score, the results deteriorated to the preoperative level. Patients with different cruciate ligament reconstructions did not have significantly different knee rating scores. Conclusion: The posterolateral sling procedure is a stable and reliable technique for posterolateral corner reconstruction. The presence of <b>chondrosis</b> at the time of surgery is an important prognosticator of functional outcome at intermediate follow-up. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Articular {{cartilage}} degeneration {{is mediated}} by inflammatory cytokines and fragments of structural matrix proteins. Few {{studies have examined}} the role of these bio-markers in intra-articular pathology of the ankle. Methods: Four groups of patients with increasing ankle pathology were enrolled. Group 1 included controls with no pain who under-went unrelated forefoot surgery. Group 2 included patients undergoing arthroscopy with intraoperative mild <b>chondrosis.</b> Group 3 included patients undergoing arthroscopy with mode-rate/severe <b>chondrosis,</b> osteochondral lesions, impingement, or loose bodies. Group 4 included positive controls with severe arthrosis undergoing ankle arthrodesis/arthroplasty. Ankle fluid was obtained by intra-articular aspiration and was assayed for IL- 6, IFN-γ, MCP, MIP- 1 β, and fibronectin-aggrecan complex (FAC), a matrix-degradation marker. There were 36 patients total, 21 males and 15 females with a mean age 45 (± 16; range 18 to 76) years and a mean VAS for pain of 4. 7 (± 3. 5; range 0 to 9). In groups 1 through 4, there were 11, 6, 15 and 4 patients respectively. Results: The mean values of MCP- 1 were 49. 8 (± 8. 0) for minimal pathology and 133. 9 (± 33. 0) for substantial pathology (pg/ml). The mean values of the FAC were 2. 83 (± 1. 16) for minimal pathology and 9. 62 (± 2. 23) fo...|$|E
40|$|From 1996 through 2004 closing wedge varus {{producing}} osteotomy of {{the proximal}} {{aspect of the}} tibia was performed on 17 patients {{for a total of}} 18 knees for painful osteoarthritis of the lateral compartment secondary to valgus deformity. The average length of time from initial surgery to follow-up was 2. 2 years (range 5 months- 5 years). Arthroscopic findings at the time of surgery showed no greater than grade II <b>chondrosis</b> of the medial femoral condoyle. Three knees had grade III <b>chondrosis</b> of the medial tibial plateau. Every patient exhibited extensive wear and tear of the lateral compartment with grade III to grade IV changes. Fourteen patients also had significant damage of the lateral meniscus. Ten of the subjects reported minimal pain with no activity limitation or mild pain; 2 ̆ 7 with slight activity limitations. The remainder reported pain scores between three and four on the pain scale used. Using the Activity Score of Tegner and Lysholm, fifteen patients reported a mean activity score of 5. 6 (range 3 - 8). Thirteen of the patients reported being satisfied with the outcome of the surgery. Three were dissatisfied with the results and would not opt for surgery again. One patient received a total knee replacement seven months following the initial high tibial osteotomy surgery...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about the {{parameters}} that influence the long-term results of isolated arthroscopically assisted reconstructions of the anterolateral bundle of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). HYPOTHESIS: <b>Chondrosis,</b> time interval from injury to surgery, and graft choice significantly influence the long-term results of single-bundle PCL reconstructions. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Between 1995 and 2001, 22 male and 3 female patients {{with a mean age of}} 30. 8 years (range, 17 - 52) underwent an anterolateral bundle reconstruction of the PCL for functional instability and pain. Nine were treated with a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft (BPTB), 15 with a semitendinosus gracilis (STG) autograft, and 1 with an Achilles tendon allograft. Twenty-two patients were clinically and radiographically reviewed at a mean follow-up of 9. 1 years (range, 6. 5 - 12. 6). Three patients were interviewed by telephone. Thirteen patients had <b>chondrosis</b> at time of surgery. The mean time from injury to surgery was 1. 5 years. RESULTS: The mean final International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm, and functional visual analog scale (VAS) scores (65, 75, and 8, respectively) were fair to good and were significantly better than preoperatively (38, 50, and 4, respectively) (P <. 001). The final Tegner (5. 7) score was significantly lower than the preinjury score (7. 2) (P <. 001). The mean anteroposterior laxity measured by KT- 1000 arthrometer and Telos stress radiographs was significantly increased on the operated side (mean side-to-side difference of 2. 1 mm and 4. 7 mm, respectively). The functional scores were not significantly different between the BPTB and STG reconstructions. Patients without <b>chondrosis</b> at time of surgery and patients operated within the first year from injury had significantly better functional results at final follow-up (P <. 05). CONCLUSION: Arthroscopically assisted reconstructions of the anterolateral bundle of the PCL in patients with symptomatic isolated grade II to IV PCL-deficient knees lead to significantly improved functional results at long term if there is no cartilage damage at time of surgery. Nonoperative treatment should not be extended more than 1 year from injury. Graft choice did not significantly influence the functional outcome at long term. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{osteoporosis}} (OP) can {{be successfully}} {{diagnosed with the}} complex use of clinical, laboratory, and X-ray studies. In terms of the population characteristics of the sizes and shapes of vertebral bodies, X-ray morphometry of the vertebral column occupies {{a special place in}} a set of radiodiagnostic methods. X-ray morphometry is required to diagnose the most pronounced deformative osteoporotic changes in the spine and to determine the time course of changes in vertebral bodies. The use of X-ray morphometric study to examine other parts of the skeleton, including the proximal femur, has become an important stage in its development for the diagnosis of OP. That of X-ray morphometry for the concurrence of osteopenia and OP with other dystrophic changes in the vertebral column primarily with <b>chondrosis</b> and osteochondrosis is of value. The accumulated diagnostic experience allows X-ray morphometry to be considered to be an effective current diagnostic study of the spine...|$|E
30|$|Controversy exists {{regarding}} the ACL graft {{choice for the}} elderly population; although the BPTB autograft has been widely used [19 – 21, 24 – 26, 31], hamstring reconstruction has recently gained in popularity because of reduced donor site morbidity and anterior knee pain [27 – 30, 32]. Furthermore, patellar tendon harvest could potentially affect the extensor mechanism in the eventuality of joint replacement surgery [27]. Studies advocate that a hamstring autograft could be more appropriate {{because of the presence}} in the older patient of patellofemoral <b>chondrosis,</b> patellar tendon weakness, and osteopenia leading to patellar fractures. However, in the only paper reporting on both autologous BPTB and hamstring tendon graft ACL reconstruction, no data on the differences between the outcomes of the two different surgical techniques were provided by the authors [28]. Various authors prefer allografts [13 – 15] in order to reduce donor site morbidity and shorten operative and rehabilitation times. We found only two studies that provided a subgroup analysis comparing outcomes in autograft and allograft ACL reconstructions [26, 31]; no statistically significant difference in the outcomes between the two groups was reported.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To redefine {{and comment}} on terms on a {{pathological}} basis, {{in order to avoid}} the confusion due to the use of terms with different meanings, to standardise usage among clinicians, radiologists and pathologists, and to facilitate literature searches. METHODS [...] Within the Committee of Pathology of the European League against Rheumatism, a study group was set up to analyse the medical literature and common practice concerning the nomenclature of rheumatic spinal diseases. The group tried to amalgamate the main trends in the field, to reconcile etymology, historical background, morphology, and common practice. RESULTS [...] The group warns against use of the terms 'acquired hyperostosis syndrome', '(von) Bechterew's disease', 'Kümmel's disease', 'pseudospondylolisthesis', 'rheumatoid spondylitis', 'spondylarthropathy' in the sense of spondarthritis, and 'spondylosis'. It recommends intercorporal or interapophyseal rather than intervertebral (osteo) <b>chondrosis,</b> zygapophyseal diverticulum rather than cyst, disc hernia rather than prolapse, spondyloarthritis rather than spondyloarthropathy, marginal rather than anterior spondylitis, and discarthrosis. It proposes 'zygarthrosis' to designate zygapophyseal osteoarthrosis. CONCLUSIONS [...] Knowledge of the pathological basis of diseases and an understanding of the original definitions given by those who coined new terms make it possible to avoid most of the confusion arising from improper use of spinal terms...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In the {{large-scale}} case-control study EPILIFT, we investigated the dose-response relationship between lifestyle factors (weight, smoking amount, cumulative duration of different sports activities) and lumbar disc disease. Methods: In four German study regions (Frankfurt am Main, Freiburg, Halle/Saale, Regensburg), 564 {{male and female}} patients with lumbar disc herniation and 351 patients with lumbar disc narrowing (<b>chondrosis)</b> aged 25 to 70 years were prospectively recruited. From the regional population registers, 901 population control subjects were randomly selected. In a structured personal interview, we enquired as to body weight at different ages, body height, cumulative smoking amount and cumulative duration of different sports activities. Confounders were selected according to biological plausibility and to the change-in-estimate criterion. Adjusted, gender-stratified odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated using unconditional logistic regression analysis. Results: The results of this case-control study reveal a positive association between weight and lumbar disc herniation as well as lumbar disc narrowing among men and women. A medium amount of pack-years was associated with lumbar disc herniation and narrowing in men and women. A non-significantly lowered risk of lumbar disc disease was found in men {{with high levels of}} cumulative body building and strength training. Conclusions: According to our multi-center case-control study, body weight might be related to lumbar disc herniation as well as to lumbar disc narrowing. Further research should clarify the potential protective role of body building or strength training on lumbar disc disease...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{test the}} inter-observer and inter-method {{reliability}} among the measures suggesting patellofemoral joint disorder on both CT and MRI {{in the same}} subject and find possible association with internal derangements of the patellofemoral joint on MRI. METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained with waiver of the informed consent in this HIPPA-compliant study. CT and MRI were evaluated in 32 knees in 32 respective subjects (10 men/ 22 women, mean age 38  ±  19  years). Three trained observers assessed tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance, trochlear angle and trochlear depth on both CT and MRI. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) {{was used to evaluate}} inter-observer and inter-method reliability. Two radiologists' consensus reading was used to evaluate their association with soft tissue abnormalities of the patellofemoral joint. Chi-square test was used to assess the statistical significance of the qualitative variables. RESULTS: There was an excellent inter-observer reliability (ICC for CT > 0. 89 and for MRI > 0. 90) and inter-method reliability (ICC > 0. 86) for all the quantitative measurements. There was a significant association between increased TT-TG distance value on MR imaging and lateral facet patellar cartilage abnormality and joint effusion (p <  0. 05). CONCLUSION: Quantitative trochlear parameters can be reliably calculated on MRI, and an abnormal TT-TG distance is the most useful measurement among various static MR imaging parameters to correlate with patellar <b>chondrosis</b> and joint effusion. TT-TG distance should be reported in patellofemoral pain syndrome patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{recent studies}} have shown intermediate-term success of both meniscal {{allograft}} transplantation (MAT) and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) performed separately, there have been no peer-reviewed studies focused prospectively on the combined procedure. By potentially reestablishing a compartment contact area closer to normal, MAT may allow a more optimal environment for ACI by reducing stress (stress = force/unit area). On the other hand, the literature suggests that MAT alone in the presence of extensive <b>chondrosis</b> performs poorly. Restoring the articular cartilage may allow the MAT to perform more similarly to series with nearly normal articular cartilage. Hypothesis: Performed concomitantly, ACI and MAT will result in significant improvements in knee function as measured by functional scoring scales and visual analog pain scales. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Preoperative and postoperative comparisons of Browne modified Cincinnati functional levels, Lysholm, visual analog rest and maximum pain, and satisfaction scores were recorded. Thirty-six total procedures were performed between 1999 and 2004. Results: Of the 36 patients entering the series, 29 had> 2 -year evaluation and scores. Four patients were recorded as failures before the 2 -year follow-up and required revision surgery. Three patients were lost to follow-up. A total of 21 medial and 8 lat-eral MAT/femoral condyle ACIs were performed. Sixteen of 29 patients had concomitant procedures performed, including tibial tuberosity osteotomy, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and high tibial osteotomy. Patients demonstrated statisticall...|$|E
