40|$|<b>Coralligenous</b> <b>habitat</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and sensitive habitats of the Mediterranean Sea and several different sampling procedures are currently used in the ecological investigations of coralligenous assemblages. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of different methods in detecting anthropogenic impacts on <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitat.</b> In particular, the choice of sampling methods, the level of taxonomic resolution, the sampling area, the number of replicates and the spatial scales for detecting possible impacts were evaluated. Results showed that photographic samples larger than 1800 cm 2, numbers of replicates larger than 10, the use of taxa and morphological groups as assemblage descriptors, and sampling designs with a high replication at small spatial scales are a valid methodological procedure in impact evaluation studies based on coralligenous assemblages...|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} patterns of {{spatial and temporal}} variability of mobile macroinvertebrate assemblages associated to <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitat.</b> A multi-factorial sampling design {{was used to test}} the hypotheses that the structure of assemblages and their spatial and temporal variability changed in relation to substrate inclination. Moreover, macroalgae and sessile macro-invertebrates were also investigated in order to detect eventual relationship between sessile and mobile assemblages. A total of 236 mobile macro-invertebrate taxa were identified, among them 2 Platyhelminthes, 4 Sipuncula, 6 Nemertea, 27 Mollusca, 86 Annelida, 103 Arthropoda, 8 Echinodermata. Results of the study showed that mobile macro-invertebrate assemblages of <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitat</b> were little influenced by the inclination of substrate and by the morphology of sessile organisms, as patterns of variation were different between the two assemblages. Mobile macro-invertebrate assemblages changed among sampling dates within one year period and they showed high variability at the spatial scale examined...|$|E

40|$|The red gorgonian Paramuricea clavata is {{considered}} a key species in Mediterranean <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats</b> and, when present at high density, its colonies may develop “gorgonian forests”, which are three-dimensional structures that increase <b>habitat</b> complexity. Mediterranean <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats</b> support high biodiversity but the structure and heterogeneity of communities can be strongly modified by several kinds of human-derived impacts. The global environmental change and human activity could threaten the <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats</b> and {{during the last few}} decades, Mediterranean suspension feeders have been involved in mass mortality events, in which P. clavata {{was one of the most}} affected. Without the complex three-dimensional structures formed by P. clavata, many benthic species may have not adequate sheltering and feeding opportunities. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ecological role of Paramuricea clavata in <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats</b> by comparing epibenthic assemblages established inside and outside gorgonian forests. This study was carried out in four sites randomly chosen, along the south-east coast of Elba island (north-western Mediterranean). The structure of the epibenthic assemblages were significantly different between area with and without gorgonians. Main differences concern very important taxa in the coralligenous bioconstruction processes like the encrusting red algae, Peyssonnelia spp. and Halimeda tuna, which were more abundant in presence of gorgonians. On the contrary, algal turf, mucilaginous algae and the invasive seaweed Caulerpa cylindracea were more abundant in areas without P. clavata. The presence of gorgonians may have a positive effect also on species diversity. The results of this study highlight the ecological role of P. clavata in the <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats...</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats</b> {{found in}} the Mediterranean Sea are {{hotspots}} comparable in biodiversity to tropical reefs. Coralligenous reefs are vulnerable to many human pressures, thus {{they are among the}} most threatened habitats in the Mediterranean Sea. In this study, we assessed the impacts on <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats</b> of activities associated with salvaging the wreck of the Costa Concordia cruise ship. After its partial foundering in 2012, the Costa Concordia remained adjacent to the eastern coast of Giglio Island (Tuscany, Italy), in the Tyrrhenian Sea, for over two years. Its salvage required high-impact engineering works, during the course of which monitoring of benthic communities was undertaken. We performed Rapid Visual Assessment (RVA) sampling (using recorded video) from 17 stations located between 35 and 76 m depth and characterized by <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats.</b> Sampling activity was performed during the summers of 2012, 2013, and 2014. In parallel, chemical and physical water parameters were measured continuously from summer 2012 to the end of summer 2014, in order to detect any perturbation in natural conditions caused by salvage activities. We assessed the ecological quality of <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats</b> by applying the COARSE (COralligenous Assessment by ReefScape Estimate) index, based on the RVA approach. Slight modifications were applied to one of the descriptors of the COARSE index in order to adjust for study site features. There was clear evidence of a reduction in <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats</b> quality. Assemblages, slope, type of pressure, and distance from the source of disturbance played a pivotal role in characterizing bottom quality. The index was shown to have an easy and cost-effective application, even in waters deeper than its calibration specification; furthermore, the modification reported here may increase its potential applications...|$|R
40|$|<b>Coralligenous</b> <b>habitats</b> are {{of special}} {{interest}} in the Mediterranean Sea because they represent {{one of the most}} important biodiversity ‘hot-spots’ and are considered of great relevance for fisheries activities in the region. Despite their importance, however, there are missing consensual methodologies for their monitoring and, despite some attempts, no environmental or ecological quality indices have been established yet. This situation could be related to the difficulties associated with their exploration and their spatial heterogeneity. These habitats are in urgent need of efficient standard monitoring and management protocols programmes to develop an effective network for their conservation. Here we reviewed the available methodologies and robotics tools used to evaluate and monitor benthic habitats, highlighting the importance of defining rapid cost-effective sampling and analyses approaches and architectures for future monitoring of changes in <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats</b> based on current technological developments. We identified still images acquisitions as the most effective data gathering system. Stereo photogrammetry, photomosaic elaboration and three-dimensional (3 D) modelling may largely improve the data analysis and therefore the quality status assessment of the <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats.</b> The advantage and efficiency of different approaches and methods, and whether they should be applied and standardised for further monitoring activities, were discussed...|$|R
40|$|The ESCA (Ecological Status of Coralligenous Assemblages) {{index was}} {{developed}} to assess the ecological quality of <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitat</b> using macroalgae as a biological indicator. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the response to human-induced pressures of macroalgae and sessile macro-invertebrates shaping the <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitat</b> and to integrate their sensitivity into the ESCA index. Coralligenous assemblages were sampled at 15 locations of the NW Mediterranean Sea classified into three groups: i) marine protected areas; ii) low urbanized locations; and iii) highly urbanized locations. A sensitivity level value was assigned to each taxon/group on the basis of its abundance in each environmental condition, the data available in the literature and the results of an expert judgement survey. The index that includes the totality of the assemblages (named ESCA-TA), calculated using both macroalgae and sessile macro-invertebrates, detected the levels of human pressure more precisely than the index calculated with only macroalgae or with only invertebrates. The potential for assessing the ecological quality of marine coastal areas was thus increased with the ESCA-TA index thanks to the use of a higher variety of descriptors...|$|E
40|$|In the Mediterranean Sea, infralittoral and circalittoral rocky bottoms (from 15 to 120 m) are {{characterized}} by a biogenic habitat, named "coralligenous", formed by the concretion of calcareous organisms, mainly algal thalli, and- to a lesser extent- by animal skeletons. This complex habitat is inhabited by a rich fauna that belongs to different taxonomic groups. Sponges, bryozoans, cnidarians and ascidians {{are the most common}} sessile organisms that inhabit the area while crustacean and molluscs are the common mobile organisms. Little information on the diversity of the molluscs that thrive in the <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitat</b> is known while this information is highly important for biodiversity management purposes. After thoroughly studying the available and accessible published literature, a database for the molluscs of the <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitat</b> has been designed and implemented for the collection and management of this information. From its index compilation more than 511 species of molluscs have been recorded so far from the coralligenous formations, the majority of which belongs to the class Gastropoda (357 sp.) followed by the Bivalvia (137 sp.), Polyplacophora (14 sp.), Cephalopoda (2 sp.) and Scaphopoda (1 sp.). Among these, the gastropod Luria lurida (Linnaeus, 1758) and Charonia lampas (Linnaeus, 1758), the endemic bivalve Pinna nobilis Linnaeus, 1758 and the endolithic bivalve Lithophaga lithophaga (Linnaeus, 1758), are protected by international conventions...|$|E

40|$|Mediterranean <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats</b> are {{biogenic}} reefs characterised by high {{species diversity}} and built mainly by encrusting calcareous red algae, growing in dim light conditions. The {{global climate change}} and several human activities may threaten species living in these habitats, especially some of those that are considered particularly relevant in structuring and in maintaining the complexity and diversity of the benthic assemblages. Among them, the red gorgonian, Paramuricea clavata (Risso, 1826), which can form dense populations, in the last decades showed worrying mass mortality events. Understand the role of this “animal forests” in the coralligenous assemblages is of fundamental importance in order to design appropriate monitoring programs and conservation policies, especially in the marine protected areas. For this purpose, benthic assemblages were studied in presence and absence of red gorgonians at two sites at the Tremiti islands. Overall, the benthic assemblages significantly differed among sites, nevertheless in both places, clear differences between assemblages associated and not associated to the gorgonian forests were found. In particular, encrusting corallinered algae were significantly more abundant in the gorgonian understories at both sites. This result indicates that the gorgonians may promote the development of calcareous algae, which are the main builders of the <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats.</b> Moreover species diversity resulted higher in the assemblages associated to the gorgonians. The present study highlights the role of Paramuricea clavata as a relevant ecosystem engineer in the <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats...</b>|$|R
40|$|In an {{era when}} we witness the erosion of {{biodiversity}} {{it is essential to}} understand the benefits provided by ecosystems and find ways to maintain them. The concept of ecosystem service has been applied in this perspective, but mainly in large-scale surveys and on terrestrial ecosystems. The primary objective of this project is to validate the inclusion of the concept of ecosystem service as a useful input to local (small-scale) community decision making in the marine environment. A second objective is to define the beneficial services provided to local areas by the <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats.</b> The application of the concept of ecosystem service at a local scale is more appropriate to local regulatory and management issues. This research was focused on the complex and threatened <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats,</b> about which the benefits and services provided are relatively little understood. To address these issues and get around the paucity of prior research, we collected the opinions of 43 experts for two marine sites (Bay of Marseille and Port-Cros National Park) on 15 services using interviews, an online questionnaire and workshops. This work validated 10 services: the most evident were "food", "diving sites", "research" and "inspiration". We also showed that even in very close-by sites, slight differences in the bundle of services may occur, and we highlighted knowledge gaps especially concerning those services (so-called regulating services) that help to regulate environmental impacts of other phenomena. This work concluded that there is a strong need to employ a referential frame to identify and then estimate services based on local criteria such as: geographical and temporal scale, size of the population of beneficiaries, value of the benefits, and state of ecosystem well-being. These results are a basis for further evaluation of these ecosystem services and can indicate their positive contribution to local decision-making concerning the regulation and management of <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background. There is {{need for}} more {{information}} on behavioural rhythms of fishes in relation to their habitat use in few or not previously monitored areas, such as <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats.</b> Some studies have compiled inventories of observable fish species in this habitat, but no studies have been performed on the temporal patterning of fish behaviour, especially at the scale of the day. The presently reported study aims at providing knowledge on finescale fluctuations of abundances and behaviour of two fish species in <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats</b> throughout the diurnal period. Materials and methods. Fish fauna was filmed hourly, for several days, from dusk to dawn, with autonomous, programmable, and rotating video systems. Diurnal variations in abundances per count, considering size classes and behaviour, were studied for two diurnal fish species-the Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, Coris julis (Linnaeus, 1758) (Labridae), and the common two-banded seabream, Diplodus vulgaris (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1817) (Sparidae) in two study areas of <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats</b> on the French Riviera. Results. Significant temporal variability at the scale of the hour was revealed for abundances of C. julis in one of the two study areas, with few individuals in crepuscular periods and highest abundances in the morning and in the afternoon. These differences were mainly due to significant diurnal variations in abundances of small and medium C. julis, which were low in crepuscular periods, whereas large-sized individuals were equally abundant during the day. On the other hand, no discernible diurnal rhythmicity of mean abundances of D. vulgaris was observed, regardless of the study area. Crepuscular periods were associated with sudden changes of abundances and behaviour for both species, with a greater percentage of mobile and solitary individuals, and few feeding individuals compared {{to the rest of the}} day. Feeding occurred mainly in the morning for C. julis. In contrast, no dial-time preference for feeding was revealed for D. vulgaris. Conclusions. The study provided preliminary insights into fine-scale diurnal variations of abundances of different life stages and of fish behaviour. Variability in abundances of life stages and of fish behaviours at different times of day should be taken into account for population assessments and spatial comparisons. Moreover, our study confirmed the use of video-imaging as an efficient non-destructive tool for the study of fish fauna in structurally complex, highly valuable habitats...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: <b>Coralligenous</b> <b>habitat</b> is {{considered}} {{the second most important}} subtidal “hot spot” of species diversity in the Mediterranean Sea after the Posidonia oceanica meadows. It can be defined as a typical Mediterranean biogenic hard bottom, mainly produced by the accumulation of calcareous encrusting algae that, together with other builder organisms, form a multidimensional framework with a high micro-spatial variability. The development of this habitat depends on physical factors (i. e. light, hydrodynamism, nutrients, etc.), but also biologic interactions can play a relevant role in structuring the benthic assemblages. This great environmental heterogeneity allows several different assemblages to coexist in a reduced space. One of the most beautiful is that characterised by the Mediterranean gorgonian Paramuricea clavata (Risso, 1826) that can contribute to above 40...|$|E
40|$|Development of the {{national}} coralligenous monitoring protocol has been recently initiated in Croatia {{in the framework of}} the MedMPAnet project, with intention to primarily fulfill reporting and monitoring requirements of the EU Habitat Directive (92 / 43 /EEC). However, basic information on <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitat</b> along the Croatian coast is still lacking, which hinders a fixed definition of the monitoring methods and metrics to be used. Instead, we propose the basic methodological approach that will enable gathering the information needed and that will serve as a basis for reformulation of the adopted methods. The proposed monitoring protocol is based on the most recent (although scarce) knowledge on the monitoring approaches for this habitat, the compilation of available information for the coralligenous thriving along the Croatian coast {{as well as on the}} results of the fieldwork devoted to testing of the monitoring methods within the project. At each site, photosampling of minimum of three areas of 2. 5 m 2 (comprised of 10 contiguous photos of 50 x 50 cm quadrats to ensure species identification) will be combined with visual census along 10 m long horizontal transects, to gather information on habitat structure and function (species composition, habitat complexity, bioconcretion and bioerosion), as well as on the degree of impact of the main disturbances (mass mortalities, invasive species, sedimentation, mucilaginous aggregates, fishing gear). Down to 40 m depth this work will be carried out by SCUBA divers whereas the use of the Remote Operate Vehicles (ROVs) is envisaged at greater depths. The obtained information will both enhance knowledge on the <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitat</b> along the Croatian coast and will provide an original data set to validate future indices of coralligenous health status, currently under development within other Mediterranean initiatives...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{patterns}} of distribution of macroalgal coralligenous assemblages {{in relation to}} depth and evaluates the role of different environmental conditions on these patterns. Two depths (30 and 40 m) were investigated off small islands and off continental coasts in order to select two different environmental conditions. Results showed differences between depths {{in the structure of}} assemblages around islands, while along the continental coasts these patterns were not evident. Moreover, differences between assemblages related to different environmental conditions were more evident in the shallower zone of distribution of the <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitat.</b> This correlative study did not allow us to identify any cause-effect relationship, but patterns we detected agree with those of other studies, suggesting that alterations in the environmental conditions may be the cause of the decrease in differences among assemblages developing at different depths and may lead to a higher spatial homogenization and an impoverishment of the whole subtidal system...|$|E

40|$|Coralligenous {{habitats}} are {{an important}} ‘hot spot’ of species diversity in the Mediterranean and grant a variety of valuable ecosystem services. Currently, these areas are under threat due to human activities such as unsustainable and destructive fishing practices, environmental phenomena, and other significant pressures related to global environmental change. The coralligenous habitats are also endangered by practices that result {{in the presence of}} abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) at sea, a worldwide phenomenon only recently stigmatized whose impacts on marine habitats and coralligenous areas are serious.

40|$|The rocky {{outcrops}} irregularly {{scattered in}} the sandy-muddy sea {{bed of the}} Northern Adriatic, formed by a base rock and a superimposed concretion of vegetal and animal organisms, are considered an infralittoral <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitat,</b> {{according to the most}} recent definition. In the last four decades, research has mainly concentrated on their geology because of the question of the origin of the base rock – very similar to beachrock – which has only recently been attributed to sedimentary cementation induced by methane seeps. Studies on their macrobenthic assemblages have also been published recently, but true comparisons among them are difficult because they mostly refer only to a few selected phyla or to short-term observations. Very few papers deal with the whole of the animal and plant communities, including all taxonomic groups and the most important environmental variables. On the basis of the literature data concerning several outcrops in the Gulf of Venice, we suggest that the Adriatic reefs differ slightly from the classic deeper coralligenous assemblages around the Mediterranean coast because they have smaller concretions of algae builders. We also suggest that the Northern Adriatic coralligenous reefs are younger than the other reefs occurring in the Mediterranean Sea...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMulti-facet {{diversity}} indices {{have been}} increasingly {{widely used in}} conservation ecology but congruence analyses both on horizontal and vertical axes {{have not yet been}} explored. We investigated the vertical and horizontal distributions of alpha and beta taxonomic (TD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) in a three-dimensional structured ecosystem. We focused on the Mediterranean coralligenous assemblages which form complex structures both vertically and horizontally, and are considered as the most diverse and threatened communities of the Mediterranean Sea. Although comparable to tropical reef assemblages in terms of richness, biomass and production, coralligenous assemblages are less known and more rarely studied, in particular because of their location in deep waters. Our study covers the entire range of distribution of <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats</b> along the French Mediterranean coasts, representing the most complete database so far developed for this important ecosystem. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of spatial diversity patterns of marine biodiversity on both horizontal and vertical scales. Our study revealed that taxonomic diversity differed from functional and phylogenetic diversity patterns at the station level, the latter two being strongly structured by depth, with shallower stations generally richer than deeper ones. Considering all stations, phylogenetic diversity was less congruent to taxonomic diversity (Pearson's correlation of r= 0. 48) but more congruent to functional diversity (r= 0. 69) than randomly expected. Similar congruence patterns were revealed for stations deeper than 50 m. (r= 0. 44 and r= 0. 84, respectively) but no significantly different congruence level than randomly expected was revealed among diversity facets for more shallow stations. Mean functional alpha- and alpha-diversity were lower than phylogenetic diversity and even lower than taxonomic alpha- and beta-diversity for both vertical and horizontal scales. Low FD and PD values at both alpha- and beta-diversity indicated functional and phylogenetic clustering. Community dissimilarities (beta-diversity) increased over depth especially in central and eastern part of the French Mediterranean littoral and in northern Corsica, indicating coralligenous vertical structure within these regions. Overall horizontal beta-diversity was higher within the 50 - 70 m depth belts. We conclude that taxonomic diversity alone is inadequate as a basis for setting conservation goals for this ecosystem and additional information, at least on phylogenetic diversity, is needed to preserve the ecosystem functioning and coralligenous evolutionary history. Our results highlight the necessity of considering different depth belts as a basis for regional scale conservation efforts. Current conservation approaches, such as the existing marine protected areas, are insufficient in preserving <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats.</b> The use of multi-facet indices should be considered, focusing on preserving local diversity patterns and compositional dissimilarities, both vertically and horizontally.

40|$|<b>Coralligenous</b> <b>habitat</b> {{results from}} a multi-stratified {{accumulation}} of crustose coralline algae and animal builders in a dynamic equilibrium with disruptive agents. The result is a complex architecture crossed by crevices and holes. Due to this three-dimensional structure, coralligenous may host a rich and diversified fauna, more abundant than any other Mediterranean habitat. Unfortunately, very few data are available about the cryptic fauna that lives inside the conglomerate. As already reported for coral reefs, the cryptic fauna {{plays an important role}} in the exchange of material and energy between water column and benthic assemblages. Here we compare the sponge community present inside and outside the coralligenous framework of Portofino Promontory (Ligurian Sea) at different depths (15 and 30 meters) not only in terms of taxonomic diversity but for the first time also in term of biomass. Sponges present on the surface of each block were collected, weighed and identified; after blocks dissolution in HCl, target cryptic sponges were separated from other organisms, weighed, and identified. We recorded a total of 62 sponge species. The average number of sponge taxa occurring outside the coralligenous accretions is lower than the number of taxa identified inside. This pattern is confirmed also regarding sponge biomass. These results underlines that studies focused on coralligenous functioning should take in account the important contribution of cryptic fauna, as recently evidenced also for tropical reef habitats...|$|E

To fill this lack of knowledge, marble settlement tiles were placed at 35 ± 1 m depth within 3 populations of Corallium rubrum dwelling in the <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitat</b> of different geographic areas of the north-western Mediterranean: Calafuria and Elba Island (Italy), and Medes Islands MPA (Spain), following a multifactorial ANOVA model and sampled photographically for four years (2003 - 2006). Overall, 517 red coral recruits settled on the tiles during the experiment, 189 of which (126 at Calafuria and 63 at Elba) were still surviving, in 2007, when the tiles were removed. The recruitment density at Medes was only one tenth that at Calafuria and Elba (0. 56 ± 0. 21 vs. 6. 06 ± 1. 75 and 4. 66 ± 1. 01 recruits dm- 2, mean ± SE). No colony survived after four years at Medes, where the lowest recruitment rate was also found. As the age of each new settled colony was known, it was possible to measure the early growth rates of individual colonies. The growth rates thus obtained were two to three times higher than that measured in older colonies and differed significantly between the geographic areas (the growth of colony basal diameter was 0. 68 ± 0. 02 and 0. 59 ± 0. 19 mm/year at Calafuria and Elba), while no significant difference was found between the actual colony growth and that previously measured in the former area. A test for secondary substrate selectivity, carried out in one area, showed that red coral preferentially settles on tubes of Serpulida than on other encrusting organisms. However, since recruitment density at Medes was lower despite the four-fold higher cover of Serpulida found there, other factors, intrinsic to the populations, such as different size-age structures or densities, leading to different larval output, may likely have determined red coral recruitment rates in the studied areas...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time, a {{comprehensive}} assessment of Mesophyllum species diversity and their distribution in Atlantic Europe and the Mediterranean Sea is presented based on molecular (COI- 5 P, psbA) and morphological data. The distribution ranges were redefined {{for the four}} species collected in this study: M. alternans, M. expansum, M. macroblastum and M. sphaericum. Mesophyllum sphaericum, which was previously known only from a single maerl bed in Galicia (NW Spain), is reported from the Mediterranean Sea. The known range of M. expansum (Mediterranean and Macaronesia) was extended to the Atlantic Iberian Peninsula. The occurrence of M. alternans was confirmed along the Atlantic French coast south to Algarve (southern Portugal). Mesophyllum lichenoides was only recorded from the Atlantic, whereas M. macroblastum appears to be restricted to the Mediterranean Sea. A positive correlation was observed between maximum Sea Surface Temperature (SSTmax) and the depth at which M. expansum was collected, suggesting that this species may compensate for higher SST by growing in deeper habitats where the temperature is lower. The latter indicates that geographic shifts {{in the distribution of}} coastal species as a result of global warming can possibly be mitigated by changes in the depth profile at which these species occur. Mesophyllum expansum, an important builder of Mediterranean <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats,</b> may be a good target species to assess its response to climate change...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRed {{calcareous}} coralline algae {{are thought}} to be among the organisms most vulnerable to ocean acidifi-cation due to the high solubility of their magnesium cal-cite skeleton. Although skeletal mineralogy is proposed to change as CO 2 and temperature continue to rise, there is currently very little information available on the response of coralline algal carbonate mineralogy to near-future changes in pCO 2 and temperature. Here we present results from a 1 -year controlled laboratory experiment to test mineralogi-cal responses to pCO 2 and temperature in the Mediterranean crustose coralline alga (CCA) Lithophyllum cabiochae. Our results show that Mg incorporation is mainly constrained by temperature (+ 1 mol % MgCO 3 for an increase of 3 • C), and there was no response to pCO 2. This suggests that L. cabiochae thalli have the ability to buffer their calcifying medium against ocean acidification, thereby enabling them to continue to deposit magnesium calcite with a significant mol % MgCO 3 under elevated pCO 2. Analyses of CCA dissolution chips showed a decrease in Mg content after 1 year for all treatments, but this was affected neither by pCO 2 nor by temperature. Our findings suggest that biological processes exert a strong control on calcification on magnesium calcite and that CCA may be more resilient under rising CO 2 than previously thought. However, previously demonstrated increased skeletal dissolution with ocean acidification will still have major consequences for the stability and maintenance of Mediterranean <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceGorgonian species show a high {{morphological}} {{variability in}} relation to the environment in which they live. In coastal areas, parameters such as temperature, light, currents, and food availability vary significantly with depth, potentially affecting morphology of the colonies and the structure of the populations, as well as their connectivity patterns. In tropical seas, the existence of connectivity between shallow and deep populations supported the hypothesis that the deep coral reefs could potentially act as (reproductive) refugia fostering re-colonization of shallow areas after mortality events. Moreover, this hypothesis is not so clear accepted in temperate seas. Eunicella singularis {{is one of the most}} common gorgonian species in Northwestern Mediterranean Sea, playing an important role as ecosystem engineer by providing biomass and complexity to the <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats.</b> It has a wide bathymetric distribution ranging from about 10 m to 100 m. Two depth-related morphotypes have been identified, differing in colony morphology, sclerite size and shape, and occurrence of symbiotic algae, but not in mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. In the present study the genetic structure of E. singularis populations along a horizontal and bathymetric gradient was assessed using microsatellites and ITS 1 sequences. Restricted gene flow was found at 30 – 40 m depth between the two Eunicella morphotypes. Conversely, no genetic structuring has been found among shallow water populations within a spatial scale of ten kilometers. The break in gene flow between shallow and deep populations contributes to explain the morphological variability observed at different depths. Moreover, the limited vertical connectivity hinted that the refugia hypothesis does not apply to E. singularis. Re-colonization of shallow water populations, occasionally affected by mass mortality events, should then be mainly fueled by larvae from other shallow water populations...|$|R
40|$|Final reportCoralligenous is a hard-bottom mainly {{biogenic}} habitat, {{produced by}} the agglomeration of calcareous encrusting algae growing in dim-light conditions. It is characterized by high structural complexity and spatial heterogeneity, thus supporting rich biodiversity {{and a variety of}} sessile assemblages, shaping a typical {{and one of the most}} important habitats of the Mediterranean Sea. It produces goods (e. g. food, raw material) and services in several domains (e. g. CO 2 sequestration, aesthetics and education). Pollution, smothering and abrasion from a variety of human activities may cause its degradation at a broad scale, whilst fishing and collection of organisms mainly affect target species. Its high aesthetic value may also induce frequentation by SCUBA divers, an additional cause of degradation. Coralligenous is also susceptible to invasive alien species. This habitat, which is of great ecological, socio-economic and cultural importance, is also under the pressures linked to global warming. CIGESMED’s GOAL was to understand links between natural and anthropogenic pressures and coralligenous habitats as well as the effects on their functioning to define the Good Environmental Status (GES) of the coastal Mediterranean Sea and propose solutions for maintaining good environmental conditions. Coralligenous specific indices have been constructed and tested by scientists, marine natural parks and reserves managers, also through the implementation of a “citizen science” pilot network. The use of the newest data mining techniques and the development of visualization tools to sort, organize and illustrate very large heterogeneous sets of data constitute an original but complex approach. It permitted to mobilize, visualize and share large data collections, and to manage knowledge to study these habitats. The OUTCOME consists of: i) experimentation and results of new methods to build survey at large scales (testing operating process and materials during dive, photo analyses, population genetics, phylogenetic and metabarcoding approaches) ii) tools to diffuse new methods (website, services, training and field tools for scientists and citizen science, publications) and avoid indices misun-derstanding, iii) tools, methods and prototypes to provide datamining usable for an integrative assessment of the GES within the Framework of the Marine Strategy Directive (for this part, CIGESMED members initiated a new consortium using CIGESMED metadata and dataset to build graph representation, mine graphs and provide tools for environmental decision making). All the outcomes are freely accessible online on websites with open access, open source and open data. The overall achievement was to to bring together researchers (in ecology, economics, sociology, law, etc.) and managers in order to (i) identify the needs and to better address them, (ii) to determine interdisciplinary areas of research concerning the development and management of the coralligenous that could be the subject of a new [multidisciplinary / European / Mediterranean] research project. CIGESMED gathered scientists from France, Greece and Turkey, making it possible to assess the <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitat</b> in a number of sites in both the northwestern Mediterranean basin and the Aegean-Levantine, under a common approach. Members of ten highly experienced marine ecology laboratories were involved. A total of 10 stations in France (in the Gulf of Lions), Greece (in the Ionian and the Aegean Seas) and Turkey (in the Aegean and the Levantine Seas) were selected to study coralligenous assemblages across the Mediterranean Sea. Analyses of photoquadrats (50 x 50 cm) and in situ visual observations revealed 313 species, belonging to 15 higher taxa. A total of 204 species were found in Turkey, 192 species in France and 109 species in Greece. Only fifty species were common in all sites. The abundance of the taxonomic groups in coralligenous habitats vary among sites and countries. The multivariate analysis revealed five main assemblages across the Mediterra-nean Sea. A number of important threats were withnessed to have an important impact on coralligenous, with the settlement of invasive alien species (e. g. Caulerpa cylindracea, Womersleyella setacea), sedimentation and factors causing algal bleaching being the most important ones. A new method and index were applied and tested in France (60 stations in Gulf of Lions and Provence) and Greece (4 stations in the Gulf of Corinth) to evaluate the health condition of coralligenous assemblages. This method (INDEX-COR), based on images analyses (60 x 40 cm) and in situ observations, takes into account three metrics giving different levels of information: (i) the ratio "Sensitive-Tolerante Species", (ii) the observable taxonomic richness of the assemblages and (iii) the structural complexity. The global index combining these metrics was tested according to a global index of pressure. Reference conditions were defined in France to propose an interpretation grid to evaluate the status of coralligenous assemblages. This grid applied in Greece demonstrated the necessity to collecte multiple and complete dataset in order to define the reference conditions for the different Mediterranean sectors (e. g. Ionian Sea, Egean Sea and Cretan Sea). Finally, additional indices (CAI, COARSE and ESCA) were tested on the datasets obtained in France and Greece. The comparison of the results is still in progress. The first ones show the advantages and the limits of each index. They underline the need to achieve precisions on (i) their degree of sensitivity in the evaluation of the coralligenous assemblages and (ii) the impact of the different images analysis techniques. Although the global set of samples is still under analysis, the metabarcoding pilot study already gave very promising results for the assessment of coralligenous community species composition: many more species were identified than by eye, predicting a higher resolution than traditional approaches for monitoring and comparing coralligenous assemblages. A dedicated Citizen Science initiative was designed and launched in the course of the project, aiming to engage enthusiast divers in the study and monitoring of coralligenous assemblages through the gathering of basic information regarding spatial occurrence, assemblage structure and associated pressures and threats. The implementation platform comprises a data collection protocol and a multilingual website which serve both educational and data submission purposes. Online and paper educational documentation, as well as observation protocol guidelines are essential tools developed to train volunteer divers. Underwater slates based on the princi-ples of rapid visual assessment have also been developed and distributed to all participants for data collection. Geo-referenced data reporting focuses on: (a) basic topographic and abiotic features for the preliminary description of each site, and the creation of data series for sites receiving multiple visits; (b) presence and relative abundance of typical conspicuous species, as well as, (c) existence of pressures and imminent threats, for the characterization and assessment of coralligenous assemblages. More than 100 observation sets from across the Mediterranean have been registered to date by approximately 30 divers while 75 members have registered to the website, which remain active after the conclusion of the project. Metadata and data {{produced by the}} CIGESMED project have a high potential for use by several stakeholders involved in environmental management. Mapping this information needed to share common definitions on coralligenous components and allows starting building a micro thesaurus. The methodology is now developed and the first part of the thesaurus is online. A new consortium called IndexMed whose task is to index Mediterranean biodiversity data, makes it possible to build graphs in order to analyse the CIGESMED data and develop new solutions for coralligenous data mining. The outreach activity of the project included participation of the Consortium to an impressive number of Conferences, Symposia and Workshops, which made it possible to achieve not only the communication of the main objectives of the project but also the development of links with other projects, targeting Marine Biodiversity [e. g. EMBOS (The European Marine Biodiversity Observa-tory), LifeWatch (ESFRI Research Infrastruc-ture), DEVOTES (DEVelopment Of innovative Tools for understanding marine biodiversity and assessing good Environmental Status), VECTORS (VECTORS of Change in European Marine Ecosystems and their Environmental and Socio-Economic Impacts) and EU BON (Building the European Biodiversity Observation Net-work) ]. A flyer was developed to provide the basic information on the project. The project was also advertised during much larger events, in the premises of the participating institutes, such as open days (e. g. exhibitions for the Climate change, TEDx events). The target audience for the outreach activity consisted of researchers and scientists, students, educators, environmental managers, policy makers and stakeholders from all the economic sectors including industry. The means which were used were: (a) the project website, which until now shows a high number of visits recorded for a specialized one: 250, 000 hits; (b) the production of 353 articles for the scientific audience and for the society at large. Five websites have been created from which information on the project is broadcasted. The methods and datasets produced by CIGESMED are disseminated to the STIC community, as free tools for studies to be used for any type of data sciences (data mining, data representation [...] .), particularly through the means provided by IndexMed and through data qualification processes (which will need to be continuously improved to keep them relevant). This reusability of the data will be improved in particular by the production of data papers and future animations planned within the framework of the IndexMed consortiumThe Steering Committee consisting of all the WP leaders and the coordinator was responsible for all practical decision making, strategic planning and implementation. A Committee of External Advisors met at an annual basis, and aimed at providing advice on all aspects of the execution of the project to ensure CIGESMED to meet its objectives...|$|E
40|$|Ecosystem-based {{management}} aims {{to provide}} a mechanism for achieving a consensus among multi-sectorial activities for sustaining goods and services and achieving ecological, economic and social objectives in an area. The present study adopts innovative methods and approaches aiming to promote a holistic approach towards collaboration and effective conservation management in Mediterranean Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). In {{order to understand the}} current management needs in the Mediterranean MPAs, a management effectiveness evaluation was conducted in the Mediterranean scale following an existing guide (Tempesta and Otero, 2013). Information was collected through a synthesis and integration of different approaches during the period 2013 - 2014, and MPA management was evaluated on the basis of 21 indicators that described the general categories: (i) management and legislation; (ii) conservation features; (iii) pressures; (iv) communication and outreach. Case studies were initially assessed separately and were finally compared in order to identify common challenges and good practices in MPA management that may be put forward. Some of the most important problems were the inadequate annual funding; limited surveillance and law enforcement; the inadequate stakeholder engagement and bottom-up approaches; policy gaps and long bureaucratic processes to take action; inadequate monitoring of ecological and socio-economic parameters; limited understanding of human activity threats and impacts along with defining critical thresholds that may assure good environmental status of marine ecosystems. We highly recommend that the evaluation be a cyclic process conducted by a neutral practitioner that will inform management decisions and that results should be disseminated in order to reach a high status of MPA management performance in the Mediterranean. The evaluation of MPA management effectiveness guided the next steps of the study towards addressing realistic MPA needs and providing suggestions to improve MPA management. We focused at Portofino MPA case study (Ligurian Sea, Italy) - the third smallest MPA in Italy hosting rich marine biodiversity and a significant amount of human activities. One of the future targets of the MPA’s consortium is to expand its area in order to improve its capacity to effectively protect vulnerable habitats and the species it hosts. Taking into account the past experience and the inadequate communication and up-to-date information in the area, this initiative is expected to raise conflicts and opposition from users. Hence, Portofino MPA represents a case study of particular interest and relevance with MPAs facing similar issues. Following a holistic methodological approach, an engagement process was carefully designed {{to provide a}}n insight into the social networks’ characteristics directly involved in supporting stakeholder engagement for sound governance performance and co-management of resources. Enhancing stakeholder engagement {{from the beginning of the}} process is essential in order to holistically inform decisions and increase the efficiency of conservation management. It is widely accepted that stakeholder engagement may promote cooperation and the exploration of possible solutions to common problems; facilitate the mitigation of conflicts due to various interests; and enhance coordination and the enforcement of common rules in a more transparent way. A framework to examine structural patterns in social networks and identify central actors with the capacity to serve as communication hubs is suggested to boost information flow and enhance stakeholder participation in decision-making. The approach consists of two powerful tools, Stakeholder Analysis and Social Network Analysis, that their capacity to provide an in-depth knowledge of the complexity of social-ecological systems and the factors that influence the engagement process in MPA management has been recently identified. Identification of stakeholders and their relations in a social network, where information exchange and interaction occurs, may highlight important channels for communication, or indicate key stakeholders with the power to control information flow and influence perceptions. This information may be leveraged to accelerate behaviour, facilitate bridging between organisations, promote deliberation, and improve the diffusion of information in MPA management. The outcomes of the study showed that the social network of the Portofino MPA exhibits a core-periphery structure where some user groups seem to have more privileges regarding access to information and resources in the area. The core of the network keeps the network together, and central stakeholders have the capacity to act as communication hubs and facilitate a two-way information flow that will foster communication, trust and collective learning in natural resource management. However, more effort should be made towards strengthening relationships between actors that may influence or be influenced by decisions relating to the MPA. The adoption of alternative communication strategies that integrate visualisation and user-friendly web platforms, in parallel to personal communication are suggested to involve more actively marginalized actors into decisions, that will increase the network’s cohesion, mitigate the power of central actors and augment plurality and new ideas in the engagement process. Production and synthesis of quantitative and qualitative information, related to conservation features and human activities, is another important aspect in conservation management that negotiation and decisions will be based on. Management of small scale and recreational fishing is one of the most important concerns and challenges that Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have to encounter from a socio-economic, cultural and ecological point of view. Monitoring and assessing fishing activity requires complicated approaches due to the heterogeneity of methods that combine different gears depending on the target species, the season and the characteristics of the area. Many standardized strategies of fisheries management have tried and failed to capture this spatial and temporal heterogeneity, or to provide improved understanding of fishing impacts on the ecosystem components. The present study developed a framework for the monitoring and mapping of recreational and artisanal fishing activity. The framework considers and may be adjusted depending on the MPA management capacity in terms of budget and technology available, personnel available, the level of trust that characterizes the relationship between the MPA and the fishermen, and the willingness of all relevant actors and authorities to provide or collate respectively information. Data from different monitoring strategies and sources were integrated to archive a complete dataset that described different fishing practices in the area. Simple spatial indicators that describe fishing effort were used to map and describe the footprint of each fishing practice on vulnerable habitats, and identify the areas that receive greater fishing pressure. However this is the first step in order to assess the impacts of fishing pressure on vulnerable habitats. Pressure-impact assessments were conducted using spatial analysis in order to holistically inform management decisions on vulnerable habitats such as coralligenous under pressure in Portofino MPA. The approach considers the cumulative impacts caused by different fishing practices and incorporates uncertainty regarding available information following the precautionary principle. Cumulative impacts are based on a conceptual model that identifies the pathways through which activities cause harm and describing the likelihood and consequences of an event. The vulnerability assessment quantifies these causal-chain links between biophysical attributes and to human stressors that are described in the conceptual models. The vulnerability informs on the potential risk of loosing (or degrading) a particular habitat due to a specific pressure, and can provide further support to the assessment of the cumulative impacts caused by different fishing practices operating in an MPA. Coralligenous communities, in terms of coverage, are more abundant in zone B, while Posidonia oceanica meadows dominate in zone C of Portofino MPA. However, a great percentage of the habitat lies outside the MPA borders, which confirms the desire of the MPA management board to expand the area. The areas that receive the highest amount of fishing effort were located between depths of 30 - 40 m receive the highest fishing pressure at the majority of zone B. The vulnerability assessment revealed that artisanal nets, and both recreational and artisanal bottom longlines, had the highest potential impact on <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitat,</b> independently from the duration that are active on the seafloor. Other recreational activities that were considered to have high potential impact for coralligenous due to the destructive characteristics of the practice and gear used, or due to the pressure’s high intensity and frequency, were vertical jigging, bottom trolling and big game with a rod and reel. The cumulative impact assessment provided an in depth understanding of combined exposure-effect approaches and identified additional areas in zone C and in greater depths, that fishing activity is necessary to be managed more strictly. Several suggestions were enlisted in order to mitigate fishing impacts on coralligenous habitats, for instance the establishment of additional spatial and temporal closures, prohibition of destructive fishing practices, etc. while policy gaps were also identified in the current management system. The approach takes into account the heterogeneity of techniques and captures the different scale of impacts on benthic habitats in a systematic, transparent and repeatable way, and provides a useful tool that integrates ecological, management and policy interventions. An emerging threat in coastal MPAs is the loss of fishing gears that drift away driven by currents and finally end up on the seafloor covering in some cases a significant amount of fragile benthic habitats like coralligenous. In Portofino MPA this is reported as a common issue and frequently divers retrieve the lost gears and monitor it. To inform the MPA regarding which areas are more susceptible to lost fishing gear, a semi-quantitative spatial analysis was conducted using information from the sea-bottom morphology (depth, slope, Benthic Position Index, rugosity, curvature). The areas identified overlap spatially with areas of high fishing effort, while the local currents agree that most susceptible areas are located in the southern part of Portofino MPA. Although data quality regarding information coming from divers was poor, the suggested analysis may provide useful information in order to focus management actions on specific areas. Finally, the Marxan with Zones conservation planning model was applied on Portofino MPA’s present zoning plan in order to provide alternative solutions for the enlargement and re-zoning of the MPA. Different scenarios concerning the regulation of human activities such as fishing and diving activities taking place at different zones were developed. In our management plan, we set high level conservation targets based on relative EU Directives, the high conservation status of the Portofino MPA (SPAMI) and management objectives. In the present study preliminary results are shown for a single scenario where a 4 -zone plan is suggested to the expanded surface area of the MPA, where diving and fishing activity are re-arranged in space and strictly regulated. The suggested zoning plan provided by MARXAN with Zones ensures that high conservation objectives are reached in Portofino MPA with the lowest possible operational cost. Overall, the present study aimed to provide a complete ecosystem-based management approach that considers the social and ecological drivers of the system as complementary components for supporting future conservation initiatives towards collaborative management of resources. The management suggestions of this study provide transparent, comprehensive and efficient plans that can improve the governance and the management of marine resources in the area. Innovative tools and methods were integrated to inform several aspects in the management of marine resources in order to promote a holistic approach towards collaboration and deliberation in MPA management. The developed methodology offers guidance on how to structure and focus efforts for collecting, synthesizing and analyzing of necessary information to inform holistically policymaking and management processes. Results provide useful advise in mitigating the cumulative impacts of human activities and deliver alternative solutions that are based on strict systematic conservation planning principles. Moreover, the study may assist the Portofino MPA to build the social conditions and a future engagement strategy where stakeholders will welcome the conservation initiative for its expansion, however particular effort should be made by the MPA management board towards this direction...|$|E
40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} {{refers to}} the ability of an organism to express different morphologies depending on the abiotic and biotic environment. Depth integrating many variables (e. g. temperature, light and hydrodynamics), may affect population structure and dynamics of the populations, as well as connectivity patterns and genetic diversity. Eunicella singularis is a Mediterranean arborescent gorgonian who plays an important rule as engineer species providing biomass and complexity to <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats.</b> It has a wide bathymetric distribution ranging from shallow rocky bottoms to deep sublittoral reefs. The species shows two depth-related morphotypes which taxonomic status is not yet clarified. The aim of the study is to analyses genetic variability and/or structuring along a vertical gradient to test the presence of the two morphotypes. Furthermore, a preliminary analyses of the phylogenetic relationship among species of the genus Eunicella has been done. Six populations of Eunicella singularis were sampled from 10 to 60 m depth in Cap de Creus and individuals belonging to Eunicella cavolinii, E. verrucosa, E. racemosa and E. stricta aphyta were collected. The genetic analyses were carried out using five microsatellite loci and ITS- 1 sequence polymorphism. The results showed a reduction of genetic variability along the vertical gradient. A threshold in connectivity was observed across 30 - 40 m depth, confirming the presence of two different Eunicella singularis morphotypes. The two morphological forms could be due to phenotypic plasticity, which allowed populations to suit different environmental conditions, or to a break in gene flow that determined the isolation of the two populations and an accumulation of genetic differences. The molecular markers used were not able to clarify the phylogenetic relationship among Eunicella species and the systematic position of the two morphotypes, conversely they risen the question on the existence of single species of Mediterranean Eunicella...|$|R

40|$|The growing need {{to assess}} the {{environmental}} status of the Mediterranean coastal marine habitats and the large availability of data collected by Reef Check Italia onlus (RCI) volunteers suggest the possibility to develop innovative and reliable indices that may support decision makers in applying conservation strategies. The aims {{of this study were}} to check the reliability of data collected by RCI volunteers, analyse the spatial and temporal distribution of RCI available data, resume the knowledge on the biology and ecology of the monitored species, and develop innovative indices to asses the ecological quality of Mediterranean subtidal rocky shores and <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats.</b> Subtidal rocky shores and coralligenous were chosen because these are the habitats more attractive for divers; therefore mlst data are referring to them, moreover subtidal rocky bottom are strongly affected by coastal urbanisation, land use, fishing and tourist activities, that increase pollution, turbidity and sedimentation. Non-indigenous species (NIS) have been recognized as a major threat to the integrity of Mediterranean native communities because of their proliferation, spread and impact on resident communities. Monitoring of NIS’ spreading dynamics at the basin spatial scale is difficult but urgent. According to a field test, the training provided by RCI appears adequate to obtain reliable data by volunteers. Based on data collected by RCI volunteers, three main categories of indices were developed: indices based on species diversity, indices on the occurrence non-indigenous species, and indices on species sensitive toward physical, chemical and biological disturbances. As case studies, indices were applied to stretches of coastline defined according to management criteria (province territories and marine protected areas). The assessments of ecological quality in the Tavolara Marine Protected Area using the species sensitivities index were consisten with those previously obtained with traditional methods. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the changes occurred over both decennial and millennial spans {{of time in}} a sponge assemblage present in coralligenous biogenic build-ups growing at 15 m depth in the Ligurian Sea (Western Mediterranean). The comparison of the sponge diversity after a time interval of about 40 years (1973 - 2014) showed {{a significant reduction in}} species richness (about 45 %). This decrease affected mainly the massive/erect sponges, and in particular the subclass Keratosa, with a species loss of 67 %, while the encrusting and cavity dwelling sponges lost the 36 % and 50 %, respectively. The boring sponges lost only one species (25 %). This changing pattern suggested that the inner habitat of the bioconstructions was less affected by the variations of the environmental conditions or by the human pressures which, on the contrary, strongly affected the species living {{on the surface of the}} biogenic build-ups. Five cores extracted from the bioherms, dating back to 3500 YBP, allowed to analyse the siliceous spicules remained trapped in them in order to obtain taxonomic information. Changes at generic level in diversity and abundance were observed at 500 / 250 -years intervals, ranging between 19 and 33 genera. The number of genera showed a sharp decrease since 3500 - 3000 to 3000 - 2500 YBP. After this period, the genera regularly increased until 1500 - 1250 YBP, from when they progressively decreased until 1000 - 500 YBP. Tentatively, these changes could be related to the different climatic periods that followed one another in the Mediterranean area within the considered time span. The recent depletion in sponge richness recorded in the Ligurian coralligenous can be considered relevant. In fact, the analysis of the spicules indicated that the sponges living in these <b>coralligenous</b> <b>habitats</b> remained enough stable during 3000 years, but could have lost a significant part of their biodiversity in the last decades, coinciding with a series of warming episodes...|$|R
