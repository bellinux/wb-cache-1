40|$|Neste artigo, a abordagem do tema da família no âmbito da Paróquia Senhor Bom Jesus de Cuiabá, a mais antiga e populosa de Cuiabá, teve menos o interesse em detectar a existência de características patriarcais do que em perceber como as especificidades locais pertinentes à região de Mato Grosso teriam forjado formas de organização {{familiar}} alternativas, bem como qual teria sido o nível de aceitação dos filhos ilegítimos por parte das famílias cuiabanas em suas mais variadas formas. A pesquisa foi realizada mediante a consulta dos registros de batismo (período 1853 - 1890) do Arquivo da Cúria Metropolitana de Cuiabá. Entre os resultados, observou-se que o recurso aos parentes parece ter sido uma solução comum e recorrente no cuidado do filho ilegítimo, evidenciando-se que a família era o espaço em geral escolhido para abrigar os nascidos fora do casamento formal.

The research was carried out by consulting the baptism documents (1853 - 1890 period) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Archives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Metropolitan Curia <b>of</b> Cuiabá. Among <b>the</b> results, it was found that resorting to relatives {{seems to have been a}} common and recurrent solution in <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illegitimate <b>kid,</b> which shows that the family was the domain chosen at large to shelter the ones born out of formal marriages...|$|R

5000|$|The song is very {{meaningful}} to Fantasia {{because it was}} written as an anthem to inspire single mothers across the United States to follow their dreams. Fantasia has stated that [...] "Baby Mama" [...] is dedicated to [...] "all of those single moms out there who tough it out to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> and work two jobs, go to school".

5000|$|Detractors of Allen's Hall of Fame {{credentials}} {{argue that}} {{his career was}} {{not as long as}} most Hall of Famers, so he does not have the career cumulative numbers that others do. They further argue that the controversies surrounding him negatively impacted his teams. Hall of Fame player Willie Stargell countered with a historical perspective of Dick Allen's time: [...] "Dick Allen played the game in the most conservative era in baseball history. It was a time of change and protest in the country, and baseball reacted against all that. They saw it {{as a threat to the}} game. The sportswriters were reactionary too. They didn't like seeing a man of such extraordinary skills doing it his way. It made them nervous. Dick Allen was ahead of his time. His views and way of doing things would go unnoticed today. If I had been manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Phillies back when he was playing, I would have found a way to make Dick Allen comfortable. I would have told him to blow off the writers. It was my observation that when Dick Allen was comfortable, balls left the park." [...] The two managers for whom Allen played <b>the</b> longest—Gene Mauch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Phillies and Chuck Tanner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Sox—agreed with Willie Stargell that Allen was not a [...] "clubhouse lawyer" [...] who harmed team chemistry. Asked if Allen's behavior ever had a negative influence on the team, Mauch said, [...] "Never. Dick's teammates always liked him. I'd take him in a minute." [...] According to Tanner, [...] "Dick was <b>the</b> leader <b>of</b> our team, <b>the</b> captain, the manager on the field. He took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young <b>kids,</b> took them under his wing. And he played every game as if it was his last day on earth." [...] Hall of Fame player Orlando Cepeda agreed, saying to author Tim Whitaker, [...] "Dick Allen played with fire in his eyes." [...] Hall of Fame teammate Rich Gossage also confirmed Tanner's view. In an interview with USA TODAY Sports, Gossage said: [...] "I've been around the game a long time, and he's the greatest player I've ever seen play in my life. He had the most amazing season (1972) I've ever seen. He's the smartest baseball man I've ever been around in my life. He taught me how to pitch from a hitter's prospective, and taught me how to play the game right. There's no telling the numbers this guy could have put up if all he worried about was stats. The guy belongs in <b>the</b> Hall <b>of</b> Fame." [...] Another of Allen's ex-White Sox teammates, pitcher Stan Bahnsen, said, [...] "I actually thought that Dick was better than his stats. Every time we needed a clutch hit, he got it. He got along great with his teammates and he was very knowledgeable about the game. He was the ultimate team guy." [...] Another Hall of Fame teammate, Mike Schmidt, credited Dick Allen in his book, Clearing the Bases, as his mentor. In Schmidt's biography, written by historian William C. Kashatus, Schmidt fondly recalls Allen mentoring him before a game in Chicago in 1976, saying to him, [...] "Mike, you've got to relax. You've got to have some fun. Remember when you were just a kid and you'd skip supper to play ball? You were having fun. Hey, with all the talent you've got, baseball ought to be fun. Enjoy it. Be a kid again." [...] Schmidt responded by hitting four home runs in that game. Mike Schmidt is quoted in the same book, [...] "The baseball writers used to claim that Dick would divide the clubhouse along racial lines. That was a lie. The truth is that Dick never divided any clubhouse." ...|$|R
