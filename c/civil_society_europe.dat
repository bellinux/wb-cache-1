40|$|In {{the fifty}} years of its history, the European Union has {{achieved}} extraordinary results, and many others seem to be within its reach. Although the European Union still has great potential, this proves difficult to realize because {{of a number of}} major obstacles. One of them is indubitably the great distance perceived – and perhaps also real – between the institutions of the European Union and its citizens; a distance such to entail, according to some commentators, a democratic deficit within the European construct. Another obstacle is the lack of a shared sense of European citizenship able to give full legitimacy to the work of the Community institutions. In face of such difficulties, the idea is rather widespread – and is also to be found in documents produced by the bodies of the European Union – that the multiform reality of <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> can contribute decisively to overcoming these obstacles by closing the distance between the Community institutions and citizens, stimulating public debate, and providing citizens with concrete opportunities to participate. However, there is no lack of those who suspect that the emphasis given to the role of <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> in the construction of Europe is highly exaggerated, and that when <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> actors concern themselves with the European dimension, they do so for covertly instrumental reasons. This paper presents the main results of empirical research carried out by administering a questionnaire to more than 2, 700 citizens belonging to ten large Italian <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> organizations. The research was enriched by ten case studies, one for each of the ten organizations surveyed. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate how, in concrete terms, the organizations considered Europe – in the awareness, however, that the data collected do not represent the entire range – extremely rich and complex – of the relationships between <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> and <b>Europe,</b> and that they are therefore in no way able to confirm or to confute either the optimistic and enthusiastic views on <b>civil</b> <b>society’s</b> role in <b>Europe</b> or the pessimistic ones. The paper describes only a small cross-section of <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> – and for that matter only Italian – in order to illustrate how, in some specific cases and in regard to a small number of contexts, the relationship between <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> and <b>Europe</b> can take shape and, especially, be perceived by its members. Analysis of the information gathered suggests that <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> – at least the portion of it considered – indeed contributes to the construction of a common European consciousness, as well as stimulating participation by citizens. But it still does so to an extent and with results that fall largely short of expectation. There are, in fact, many people whose membership of <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> organizations is only formal and passive, and who have developed no European sensibility over time. Nevertheless, as found by the survey, there are others whose participation in the activities of the organizations to which they belong has altered their attitudes towards Europe, The potential of <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> should not be exaggerated, therefore, but nor can it be denied...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThese {{authors have}} {{somewhat}} neglected the potential {{effects of such}} processes on airport planning, and in particular, the capacity to built and develop major airport infrastructures throughout Europe. Indeed, airports have long been considered as mere tools in service of supporting the development of airlines, civil aviation industries and air traffic. This somewhat functionalist approach to airport infrastructures and to their managing authorities, i. e. airport management authorities, underestimates their structuring role over policy-making dynamics in this sector. Indeed, whereas external factors such as internationalization, liberalization and European integration were considered as major explanations of policy change by political scientists, the study of internal factors such as territorial dynamics, social and political mobilizations, and devolution processes were abandoned to urban sociologists and social movement theorists. By contrast, we argue that the dynamics of airport planning, i. e. how, by whom and where airports are built, modernized and extended, also contribute to explaining processes of policy change in the air transport domain, and to a larger extent, evolving relationships between State and <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> in <b>Europe...</b>|$|R

Schmitter (EUI); Professor Jan Zielonka (EUI/St. Anthony’s College, Oxford) (Supervisor) This study {{examines}} {{the concept of}} <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> from three distinct, yet interrelated, angles taking their departure from several shortcomings characteristic of current discourse on <b>civil</b> <b>society.</b> Firstly, the recent renaissance and subsequent expansion of thought and discussion about <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> have been accompanied by a noteworthy lack of conceptual and terminological clarity. A high degree of eclecticism prevails, with contributors choosing arguments and definitions commensurate with their own ideological, disciplinary and cultural positions but ignorant of the full conceptual wealth and development of <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> through history. Therefore, {{the first part of}} this study scrutinises the conceptual history of <b>civil</b> <b>society,</b> demonstrates how its analytical and normative content has dynamically developed over time and, against this backdrop, proposes and justifies a clear-cut definition. Secondly, it is striking to observe how thin the empirical knowledge base, in which the current debate is grounded, is. Theoretically oriented contributions prevail over empirical enquiries, and where empirical accounts have been provided, evidence is more often than not anecdotal, focuses on specific aspects of <b>civil</b> <b>society,</b> or addresses individual cases, countries or contexts. For this reason, the second part of this study provides a systematic, comprehensive and comparative analysis of <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> in East-Central <b>Europe,</b> and assesses developments in the region in comparison to the wider European context. Thirdly, and in returning to more theoretical considerations, little attention has been paid to the limits of <b>civil</b> <b>society.</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>society</b> is seen as a cure-all for many, if not all, problems plaguing societies today. However, inasmuch as it can be a blessing, <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> can also be a curse for democracy, as the last part of this study argues. The challenge <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> faces is to develop such features that make it a strong contributor to democracy, and the approach proposed in this study hopes to open up novel avenues for scholarly exploration and for the practical development of <b>civil</b> <b>society...</b>|$|R

If we come at the café from a different angle, and decide to take what happens there seriously rather than just talking about cafés in general, what do we find?

40|$|In {{this article}} I attempt to analyse three urban African performances; Nyawo, the tea party, and Beni. I employ the socio-historical {{analysis}} model which attempts {{to understand the}} relationship between the field of cultural production and the field of power. Historically the ascendancy to power of the bourgeoisie in Western Europe facilitated the assimilation of its culture and taste by virtually all of Western <b>civil</b> <b>society.</b> Colonisation in Rhodesia (in its blue print form) intended to use the same principle of extending English rulership and influence with the goal of transforming Rhodesia to be like the metropolitan state in manifesting the nature and will of the English in lifestyle, actions, activities and culture. 1 As evidenced by the nature of these urban African performances, domination does not necessarily result in absolute collaboration. Rhodesian discourse was both collaborated with and resisted by African cultural producers. I look at this element of collaboration and resistance through Ranajit Guhaâ€™s (1997) frame of the articulation of power where domination implies subordination. In the case of colonial administrations, coercion seems to outweigh persuasion in the articulation of domination thereby denying absolute assimilation of colonial culture by Africans as was the case of <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> in Western <b>Europe...</b>|$|R

Another connotation of the concept was democracy – or democratisation – and a third, which was introduced when it became obvious that institutions were important for the transition to succeed, the Rechtsstaat, translated into English as the legal state or a state of law. The transition period proper lasted from early 1989, when the Round Table talks between the government and the opposition started in Poland, to late 2002, when the European Union decided to offer the Baltic and Central European states full membership in the Union. The expansion of the European Union from the Elbe to the Bug is a fulfilment of the project to create a peaceful Europe, which was attempted in Paris in 1919 - 1920 and, as far as Western Europe was concerned, by the establishment of the EEC in 1958. Speaking in historical terms, the latter was a second Locarno. The original one in 1925 was Germany’s recognition of the boundaries with France and Belgium. It was not followed by a similar agreement with Poland concerning its boundary with Germany. However, the eastern expansion of the European Union amounts to a “Locarno” for Central Europe. 1989 was not the final year of the short twentieth century, which began in 1914 with the outbreak of the Great War. 2004 will be the final year, when the three Baltic and the five Central European states become members of the European Union. The prospects for democracy and <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> in <b>Europe</b> east of the Elbe are identical with the prospects for democracy and <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> in the European Union...|$|R
40|$|Intellectuals were {{heroes of}} the {{collapse}} of Communism across Eastern Europe. Adam Michnik, ﻿﻿Václav Havel, and many others left an uplifting imprint on an era that witnessed the emergence of their inspiring progeny, including flying universities, the notion of 2 ̆ 2 living in truth 2 ̆ 2, KOR, and Charter 77. In Yugoslavia, intellectuals were as prominent and as influential as their counterparts elsewhere in Eastern Europe, but the results of their engagement were radically different. Whereas the new <b>civil</b> <b>societies</b> of East-Central <b>Europe</b> were built on a foundation of human rights, tolerance, and indifference to ideology, 1 intellectual engagement in Yugoslavia produced nationalisms that ranged from the relatively more civic-minded Slovenian variant to the exclusive and intolerant movements on Serbia and Croatia. The lasting images of the work of Yugoslav intellectuals may well be the sieges of Vukovar and Sarajevo, the flight of {{a quarter of a million}} Serbs from Croatia in a couple of weeks in the summer of 1995, and the bone fields of eastern Bosnia, which are far different images than those bequeathed by KOR or Charter 77...|$|R

The fruit of these relations included books (such as Social actors and designing the <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> of Eastern <b>Europe)</b> and articles (for Futuribili and Russian journals), conferences and seminars. They also produced a macro-research project on relations among {{ethnic groups in}} Europe, including three (Italians, Friulani and Slovenes) in Friuli Venezia Giulia, three (Serbs, Hungarians and Slovaks) in the Yugoslav region of Vojvodina, four (Ukrainians, Russians, Jews and Belorussians) {{in the region of}} Kharkov, and four (Russians, Ukrainians, Caucasians and Tartars) in the Siberian region of Tyumen. In 1992 an international conference in Gorizia was attended by many scholars and teachers from universities in eastern Europe, notably Eotvos Lorand University and the University of Economic Sciences in Budapest, the Universities of Warsaw and Kraków and Charles University in Prague. This was the year after the foundation of Isig Journal, which publishes articles in Italian and English on international relations, with particular reference to former communist countries and their transition processes.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{promotion}} of intercultural dialogue (ICD) {{in the framework of}} EU external action on the Mediterranean between 1990 and 2014. ICD is understood as a cultural foreign policy instrument that the EU has promoted in a changing, vague and contradictory manner to engage the <b>civil</b> <b>societies</b> of <b>Europe</b> and of the Mediterranean into a common effort to attenuate the tensions that derive from the socio-cultural divergences among the people and governments of this whole area. With the goal of shedding light on this obscure aspect of EU policy-making in the Mediterranean, this thesis aims primarily to analyse why the approach of the EU to ICD has changed during the time frame in reference, and how the EU has modified the formulation, implementation and role of this policy instrument. Guided by the conceptual lens of Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA), the research examines ICD within a broader analysis of the evolution of EU foreign policy in the area. It argues that the EU commitment to advance ICD within its Mediterranean policies can be divided into three distinct phases: a ‘phase of emergence’ (1990 - 2001), a ‘phase of consolidation’ (2001 - 2010) and a ‘phase of professionalisation’ (2010 - 2014). The main factor that shaped this three-phase evolution is identified in how EU policy-makers assessed the potential contribution of ICD to address the changing socio-cultural divide in the Euro-Mediterranean space following three major events: a) the conclusion of the Cold War in 1990; b) the terror attacks of 9 / 11 2001; and c) the outbreak of the Arab uprisings in December 2010...|$|R
