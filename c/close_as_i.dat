500|$|Dave Gibbons {{became an}} adviser on Snyder's film, but Moore {{has refused to}} have his name {{attached}} to any film adaptations of his work. Moore has stated he {{has no interest in}} seeing Snyder's adaptation; he told Entertainment Weekly in 2008 that [...] "here are things that we did with Watchmen that could only work in a comic, and were indeed designed to show off things that other media can't". While Moore believes that David Hayter's screenplay was [...] "as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could imagine anyone getting to Watchmen", he asserted he did not intend to see the film if it were made.|$|E
500|$|The animators and {{character}} designers {{had a lot}} of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a [...] "burly ex-marine guy with a crew cut", but would later be modeled after Michael Douglas in the movie Falling Down and director Jim Reardon's college roommate. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. The producers decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show. Azaria felt that the role should instead go to William H. Macy. According to Azaria, [...] "I based the character on William Macy. I can't really copy him vocally, but I tried to get as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could and copy his rhythms and the way he has that sort of seething passion underneath that total calm exterior." [...] The producers worked a lot with Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would. Azaria felt that it was the role he worked hardest on, adding [...] "I think it's the one we did the most takes on, the most emotional, it felt like the one I worked on the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{search of}} a record-tying third {{consecutive}} Open Championship, Woods fell out of contention with a second-round 75, and never mounted a charge over the weekend. Although his putting was solid (he sank a 90-footer in the first round), his iron play held him back. [...] "I wasn't hitting the ball as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> needed to all week," [...] he said, after he finished tied for twelfth, five strokes off the pace.|$|E
2500|$|People with anxious-preoccupied {{attachment}} type tend {{to agree}} with the following statements: [...] "I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> would like", and [...] "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value me as much as I value them." [...] People with this style of attachment seek high levels of intimacy, approval, and responsiveness from their attachment figure. They sometimes value intimacy {{to such an extent that}} they become overly dependent on the attachment figure. Compared to securely attached people, people who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment tend to have less positive views about themselves. They may feel a sense of anxiousness that only recedes when in contact with the attachment figure. They often doubt their worth as a person and blame themselves for the attachment figure's lack of responsiveness. People who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, emotional dysregulation (ED), worry, and impulsiveness in their relationships.|$|E

60|$|The {{hotel at}} Trenton was also <b>closed,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was told. But {{even if there}} were no hotel at Trenton, it can be visited without difficulty. It is within a {{carriage}} drive of Utica, and there is, moreover, a direct railway from Utica, with a station at the Trenton Falls. Utica is a town on the line of railway from Buffalo to New York via Albany, and is like all the other towns we had visited. There are broad streets, and avenues of trees, and large shops, and excellent houses. A general air of fat prosperity pervades them all, and is strong at Utica as elsewhere.|$|R

30|$|In {{the right}} panel of Figure 7, {{the same is}} shown for the excitonic spectrum. Again, both the {{emission}} lines get <b>closer</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> is increased, and they finally overlap at an intensity of I[*]=[*] 3 I 0. Interestingly, the V-polarized excitonic emission is only slightly effected by I, which can simply be explained by a coupling of the linearly polarized laser field with mainly the H-polarized excitons. It is shown that QDs with FSSs of more than 20 μeV can be tuned to values small enough to create polarization entangled photon pairs. The presented technique has the advantage that one can precisely in-situ modify the FSS, {{but on the other}} hand, an additional laser source is needed, making the on chip implementation more complicated.|$|R
60|$|It was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud, mud, deep {{in all the}} streets. Day after day, a vast heavy veil {{had been}} driving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in the East there were an Eternity of cloud and wind. So furious had been the gusts, that high {{buildings}} in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs; and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of windmills carried away; and gloomy accounts had {{come in from the}} coast, of shipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages of wind, and the day just <b>closed</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> sat down to read had been the worst of all.|$|R
60|$|And now I {{began to}} feel that I was {{neglecting}} my business, that since I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes, the least I could do was to overhear them at their councils, and that my plain and obvious duty was to draw as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could manage, under the favourable ambush of the crouching trees.|$|E

60|$|So Marais came, {{and with}} him Marie, who blushed and smiled, but to my mind looked more of a grown woman than ever before; one who had left girlhood behind her and found herself {{face to face with}} real life and all its troubles.
