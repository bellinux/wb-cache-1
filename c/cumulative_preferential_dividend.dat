50|$|In 1997 the {{eligibility}} rules (below) were {{introduced by the}} Howard-Costello Liberal Government, with a $2,000 small shareholder exemption. In 1999 that exemption was raised to the present $5,000. In 2000, franking credits became fully refundable, not just reducing tax liability to zero. In 2002, <b>preferential</b> <b>dividend</b> streaming was banned. In 2003, New Zealand companies could elect to join the system for Australian tax they paid.|$|R
50|$|One share, {{one vote}} is a {{standard}} found in corporate law and corporate governance, which suggests that each person who invests money in a company has one vote per share of the company they own, equally with other shareholders. Often, shares with one vote each {{are referred to as}} common stock. Most systems of corporate law discourage shares without votes unless they have <b>preferential</b> <b>dividends</b> or liquidation rights, and shares with multiple voting rights are discouraged altogether so as to prevent the concentration of corporate power.|$|R
50|$|The company, {{incorporated}} {{under the}} 1856 {{and then the}} 1862 Acts, had £60,000 of share capital, divided into 600 £100 shares, each subdivisible by five. Capital could be increased according to art 27 by the general meeting. New shares {{would be the same}} as old shares, and {{there was no mention of}} priority or preference shares. The company wished to buy a meter manufacturing business that was in administration from one John West, and wished to change its articles to allow preferential shares to be allotted to him, as part of the consideration for the deal. There would be 100 £100 shares, carrying a <b>preferential</b> <b>dividend</b> of £5 each.|$|R
40|$|We show that, in {{the finite}} propositional case, {{traditional}} circumscriptions can be fully described {{only from the}} formulas which can never come {{as a result of}} the given circumscription (the "inaccessible formulas"). Some work has already been done on the subject. Siegel and Forget have introduced the general notion of X-logic, and they have considered the case of finite propositional circumscriptions. However, their result is restricted to the case where no varying proposition appears, which is known to be a severe restriction in terms of expressivity. We extend this result in the finite propositional case to any <b>cumulative</b> <b>preferential</b> entailment, thus in particular to any "traditional circumscription", that is we allow varying propositions. Moreover, we describe the smallest possible set which can be used for this purpose. Wer exhibi...|$|R
50|$|These motions {{generally}} {{cannot be}} used to specify alternative forms of voting such as <b>cumulative</b> voting or <b>preferential</b> voting. Those methods can only be done through {{a provision in the}} bylaws. Likewise, proxy voting is generally prohibited, except in situations in which membership is transferable, as in stock corporations and even then, only by authorization in the bylaws.|$|R
25|$|Companies {{limited by}} shares also acquire finance through ‘equity’ (a synonym for the share capital). Shares differ from debt in that {{shareholders}} rank last in insolvency. The main justification for shareholders’ residual claim is that, unlike many creditors (though not large banks) {{they are capable}} of diversifying their portfolio. Taxation of profits on shares can also be treated differently with a different tax rate (under the Income Tax Act 2007) to capital gains tax on debt (which falls under the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992). This makes the distinction between shares and debt important. In principle, all forms of debt and equity arise from contractual arrangements with a company, and the rights which attach are a question of construction. For instance, in Scottish Insurance Corp Ltd v Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd the House of Lords held that when the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946 was passed, preferential shareholders were entitled to no extra, special share of assets upon winding up: construction of the terms of the shares entitled them to extra dividends, but without special words to the contrary, shareholders were presumed equal otherwise. For anyone to become a member of a company under the Companies Act 2006 section 33, the contract for shares must simply manifest the intention to do so. However, beyond this, the dividing line between shares and debt is more a matter of standard practice than law. It is legally possible to {{become a member of the}} company without being a shareholder, simply by being accepted and registered on the members’ register. It is also possible to be a shareholder without being a member immediately. It is standard practice that shareholders have one vote per share, but occasionally shareholders (particularly those with <b>preferential</b> <b>dividend</b> rights) do not have votes, and debt holders and others may have votes without having shares. It is even possible for creditors to contract to be subordinated behind shareholders in insolvency – it is just unlikely, and strongly discouraged by the regulatory framework. Shares are also presumed to be transferable to other people, although like other rights, the right to trade is subject to the company’s constitution.|$|R
30|$|Method of PAL {{spectroscopy}} employing conventional three- and two-term fitting {{was utilized}} to study free-volume structure of β-As 4 S 4 arsenical subjected to coarse- and fine-grained powdering. The pelletized samples of coarse-grained powdered β-As 4 S 4 demonstrate {{a great variety}} of possible positron and Ps trapping sites. Transition to fine-grained powdered β-As 4 S 4 due to high-energy mechanochemical milling results in <b>cumulative</b> production of <b>preferential</b> positron traps with characteristic lifetimes close to defect-related lifetimes in crystalline realgar α-As 4 S 4 polymorph. These positron traps were supposed to originate from grain boundaries and interfacial free volumes appeared near aggregated β-As 4 S 4 crystallites.|$|R
5000|$|Interest in scale-free {{networks}} {{began in}} the late 1990s with the reporting of discoveries of power-law degree distributions in real world networks such as the World Wide Web, the network of Autonomous systems (ASs), some networks of Internet routers, protein interaction networks, email networks, etc. Most of these reported [...] "power laws" [...] fail when challenged with rigorous statistical testing, but the more general idea of heavy-tailed degree distributions—which many of these networks do genuinely exhibit (before finite-size effects occur) --are very different from what one would expect if edges existed independently and at random (i.e., if they followed a Poisson distribution). There are many different ways to build a network with a power-law degree distribution. The Yule process is a canonical generative process for power laws, and has been known since 1925. However, it is known by many other names due to its frequent reinvention, e.g., The Gibrat principle by Herbert A. Simon, the Matthew effect, <b>cumulative</b> advantage and, <b>preferential</b> attachment by Barabási and Albert for power-law degree distributions. Recently, Hyperbolic Geometric Graphs have been suggested as yet another way of constructing scale-free networks.|$|R
40|$|Election law {{suffers from}} a {{comparative}} blind spot. Scholars in the field have devoted almost no attention to how other countries organize their electoral systems, let alone to the lessons that {{can be drawn from}} foreign experiences. This Article begins to fill this gap by carrying out the first systematic analysis of redistricting practices around the world. The Article initially separates district design into its three constituent components: institutions, criteria, and minority representation. For each component, the Article then describes the approaches used in America and abroad, introduces a new conceptual framework for classifying different policies, and challenges the exceptional American model. First, redistricting institutions can be categorized based on their levels of politicization and judicialization. The United States is an outlier along both dimensions because it relies on the elected branches rather than on independent commissions and because its courts are extraordinarily active. Unfortunately, the American approach is linked to higher partisan bias, lower electoral responsiveness, and reduced public confidence in the electoral system. Second, redistricting criteria can be assessed based on whether they tend to make districts more heterogeneous or homogeneous. Most of the usual American criteria (such as equal population, compliance with the Voting Rights Act, and the pursuit of political advantage) are diversifying. In contrast, almost all foreign requirements (such as respect for political subdivisions, respect for communities of interest, and attention to geographic features) are homogenizing. Homogeninng requirements are generally preferable because they give rise to higher voter participation, more effective representation, and lower legislative polarization. Lastly, models of minority representation can be classified based on the geographic concentration of the groups they benefit and the explicitness of the means they use to allocate legislative influence. Once again, the United States is nearly unique in its reliance on implicit mechanisms that only assist concentrated groups. Implicit mechanisms that also assist diffuse groups—in particular, multimember districts with limited, <b>cumulative,</b> or <b>preferential</b> voting rules—are typically superior because they result in higher levels of minority representation {{at a fraction of the}} social and legal cost...|$|R
