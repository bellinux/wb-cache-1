This argument assumes that there was more agreement on R 2 P before the Libyan intervention than there was afterwards. Yet, a close examination of the Security Council’s use of language on R 2 P shows the opposite: R 2 P was highly contentious within the Security Council prior to the Libyan intervention, and less so afterwards. Not only has the Council used R 2 P language more frequently since 2011, but also negotiating this language has become quicker and easier. To demonstrate this I compare negotiations on Darfur with deliberations during and after the Arab Spring. Resolution 1706 on Darfur was the first time the Security Council referred to R 2 P in a <b>country-specific</b> <b>resolution</b> – and indeed it was the only <b>country-specific</b> <b>resolution</b> to refer to R 2 P before 2011 – making it an apt point of comparison. Via focused analysis on how the language used in Security Council resolution evolves over time, this article demonstrates that the Council has found ‘agreed language’ on R 2 P that is acceptable to members, both for thematic resolutions and country-specific resolutions. Language on R 2 P in Security Council resolutions has shifted from contentious to commonplace...|$|E

Beyond a breakthrough resolution on human rights in Syria, current events were also referred to in a number of thematic resolutions: on human rights defenders, torture, women’s political participation, {{and the role of the}} uN in enhancing democratisa-tion. An important change was witnessed in the behaviour of certain States undergoing transition; Tunisia and Libya shifted their traditional positions against <b>country-specific</b> <b>resolutions,</b> voting in favour of resolutions on Myanmar, Iran, and the Democratic people’s Republic of Korea. Egypt acted in a contradictory manner, but ultimately supported the Syria resolution. Other positive developments included increased attention to the issue of reprisals; disposal of a polarising text on defamation of religions – replaced by one on religious tolerance; and adoption of the Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training, and a third optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on individual communications. Despite this progress, the Third Committee was not without challenges. The session saw the coalescing of an unofficial group of 11 States, united in an anti-civil society agenda. These hard-line governments fought with some success to undermine the independence of certain uN mandate holders, and the contributions of civil society and NGOs. Thoug...|$|R
