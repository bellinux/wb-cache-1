5|$|According to Vid Gaković, who was {{a member}} of National Unity in 1914, Stojanović was an ambitious and talented young man. He was {{determined}} that his voice would be heard and he liked being the centre of attention. He was severe to younger members of the association, whom he sometimes sharply criticised. Nevertheless, younger students liked being around him. Gaković described him as a tall and handsome man who greatly <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> his appearance; he wore a bow tie and a broad-brimmed hat.|$|E

5|$|Pound {{was fascinated}} by the {{translations}} of Japanese poetry and Noh plays which he discovered in the papers of Ernest Fenollosa, an American professor who had taught in Japan. Fenollosa had studied Chinese poetry under Japanese scholars; in 1913 his widow, Mary McNeil Fenollosa, decided to give his unpublished notes to Pound after seeing his work; she was looking for someone who <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> poetry rather than philology. Pound edited and published Fenellosa's The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Terry Pratchett {{was pleased}} with the 1986 {{interactive}} fiction game The Colour of Magic, but criticised its poor marketing. He was reluctant to grant Discworld licences due to concern for the series, and wanted a reputable company who <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> the property. Other video game companies had previously approached Pratchett seeking a licence. One such company was AdventureSoft, and their failure to obtain a Discworld licence {{led to the creation of}} Simon the Sorcerer, which took inspiration from the Discworld series of books.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} because the designer Gregg Barnett wanted a large adventure for CD-based systems. A licence {{was difficult to}} obtain; Pratchett was reluctant to grant one as he wanted a Discworld game to be developed by a company with a reputation and who <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> the property. An original story was created due to Barnett having difficulty basing games on one book. Discworld was praised for its humour, voice-acting and graphics, though some criticised its gameplay and difficult puzzles. Discworld {{was followed by a}} sequel, , in 1996.|$|E

5|$|The topics the Drapier {{addresses}} span from absentee land {{owners to}} importing of goods from Britain to the favouring of Englishmen over Irishmen for Irish governmental positions. These issues were the many issues that Swift <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> and saw as threatening Ireland before Wood's halfpence controversy. However, these individual issues {{were not as}} important as the independence and unity of Ireland: the specifics of independence were less important than self-rule. Some argue that Swift, after Wood's patent was withdrawn, removed himself from the political landscape to focus on writing Gulliver's Travels, in which he picked up many of the same ideas.|$|E
5|$|Sereno E. Payne, {{chairman}} of the House Ways and Means Committee, had held hearings in late 1908, and sponsored the resulting draft legislation. On balance, the bill reduced tariffs slightly, but when it passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate, the {{chairman of}} the Senate Finance Committee, Rhode Island Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, attached many amendments raising rates. This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette, who urged Taft to say that the bill was not in accord with the party platform. Taft refused, angering them. Taft insisted that most imports from the Philippines be free of duty, and according to Anderson, showed effective leadership on a subject he was knowledgeable on and <b>cared</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E

One day, Bran visits her, accompanied by his new fiance Lady Nimiar Argaliar and the Marquis of Shevraeth, who is preparing to take the throne of Remalna. Now accustomed to the fine fashions of court, Bran expresses dismay at finding Mel dressed in old clothes - she never before <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> her appearance. Mel becomes shy and embarrassed about her lack of courtly finesse and grace, and avoids the visitors, especially Shevraeth, who she fears looks down on her. Nimiar convinces Mel to return with them to court, and begins to teach her the essential of life there, including its customs, clothing styles, and hand fan language.|$|E

It served as an advisory board to the Roosevelt administration on issues facing black people in America. It was composed of numerous talented blacks, mostly men, who had been appointed to positions in federal agencies. This was the first collective of black people working in higher positions in government. It suggested to voters that the Roosevelt administration <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> black concerns. The group gathered in Bethune's office or apartment and met informally, rarely keeping minutes. Although as advisers they did not directly create public policy, they were a respected leadership among black voters; they influenced political appointments and disbursement of funds to organizations that would benefit black people.|$|E

5|$|After {{some time}} away from TV, Ziggler {{returned}} on the August 22 edition of SmackDown Live to declare that he would undergo a gimmick change on the following week's edition. He later started mocking, week after week, the entrances of current and former wrestlers such as John Cena, Naomi, Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage. Ziggler believed that fans only <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> elaborated entrances, and not about the in-ring performances, where he claimed he was the best. However, after mocking The Undertaker's entrance, Ziggler was interrupted by Bobby Roode, who challenged Ziggler to a match at Hell in a Cell, which Ziggler accepted. At the event Ziggler, who had promised a never seen before entrance but ended up being an entrance with no music, lights and titantron, was defeated by Roode after a Roll Up; right after that, Ziggler attacked Roode from behind with a Zig Zag. On the October 17 edition of SmackDown Live, Ziggler defeated Roode in a rematch by a roll up, similar to how Roode defeated him. On 31st October's edition of Smackdown, Ziggler failed to earn a spot in Team Smackdown for Survivor Series 5 on 5 elimination match vs Raw after being defeated by Roode in a 2 out of 3 falls match and thus ending their feud.|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} part has six chapters: End {{of life and}} dying, Palliate care, Home hospice multidisciplinary team, Specific of <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill patient in home background, Family and caregivers, Specifics of <b>care</b> <b>about</b> dying people in the CR. The second, practical part is based on qualitative-quantitative research with three goals. The first goal was to define the needs of family members <b>caring</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in domestic background. The second goal was to define the skills of nurses necessary for saturation {{of the needs of}} family members <b>caring</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in domestic background, and the last goal was to specify the present drawbacks of the care upon the research results. The following research questions were set in the qualitative part of the research: 1. What factors lead to decision of a family to participate in the <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in domestic background? 2. What factors prevent families from integration into the <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in domestic background? 3. What skills are necessary for a nurse in the process of family integration into the <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill client in home background? The research sample of the qualitative research consisted of six respondents having experience with <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a dying patient in domestic background. A semi structured interview consisting of six questions was the research method of this part of the thesis. The questions focused on the <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a dying family member in home background. The following hypotheses may be deduced from the research: 1. Giving information to lay caregivers before releasing a terminally ill client to domestic treatment within education contributes to their active involvement in the care. 2. Participation of a mobile hospice team in the <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill client in home background contributes to saturation of the needs of certainty and safety of the caregivers. The following hypotheses were set {{at the beginning of the}} quantitative research: 1. Respondent?s feeling of inability to participate in the care is an obstacle to the decision to start <b>caring</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in home background. 2. Fear of economic risk is an obstacle to the decision to start <b>caring</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in home background. 3. Utilization of professional services in the <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in home background depends on awareness of their existence and the extent of services being provided. The research sample consisted of 198 persons from the wide public. The data were collected by means of a questionnaire. The questionnaires examined the readiness of the respondents to decide to start <b>caring</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in home background and their awareness of the existence of institutions providing palliative care in home background. The first two hypotheses were confirmed by the results of the questionnaire research, the third one was not confirmed.

5|$|In 1987, the Jets {{won their}} first two games. NFL players then staged a strike; a team {{composed}} mostly of replacement players lost two of the next three games. The locker room was divided after the strike due to the decision of a few players, led by Gastineau, to cross the picket line. The Jets remained in contention in a mediocre AFC East {{through much of the}} season, but dropped all four games in December to finish 6–9, in last place. In 1988, the Sack Exchange era ended as Joe Klecko failed his offseason physical and was waived, linebacker Lance Mehl announced his retirement during training camp, and Mark Gastineau retired midseason, citing personal reasons. In spite of these departures, the Jets finished with an 8–7–1 record. They secured a winning record by ending the season with a victory over the Giants, which cost their in-state rivals a playoff berth. The team performed badly in 1989, finishing 4–12. On December 18, 1989, the Jets hired executive Dick Steinberg from the New England Patriots to take over as general manager. Three days after New York's final game of the season, a 37–0 loss to the Bills at Giants Stadium, Steinberg fired Walton and began to search for the team's 10th coach. The disastrous 1989 campaign cost Walton the chance to be the first Jets coach to complete his career with a winning record, a statistic he later admitted he <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> deeply.|$|E
