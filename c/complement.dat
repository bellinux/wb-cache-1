5|$|In humans, this {{response}} is activated by <b>complement</b> binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of <b>complement</b> proteins to carbohydrates on {{the surfaces of}} microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of the response {{is a result of}} signal amplification that occurs after sequential proteolytic activation of <b>complement</b> molecules, which are also proteases. After <b>complement</b> proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other <b>complement</b> proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of <b>complement</b> can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIf X is a Tychonoff space, C(X) its ring of real-valued {{continuous}} functions, and f∈ C(X), {{then the}} cozeroset of f is coz(f) = {x∈X:f(x) ≠ 0 }. If, for every cozeroset V of X, {{there is a}} disjoint cozeroset V′ such that V∪ V′ is dense in X, then X {{is said to be}} cozero <b>complemented.</b> It has long been known that X is cozero <b>complemented</b> iff the space MinC(X) of minimal prime ideals of C(X) (in the hull-kernel or Zariski topology) is compact iff the classical ring of fractions of C(X) is von Neumann regular. While many characterizations of cozero <b>complemented</b> spaces are known, they seem not to be adequate to answer some natural questions about them raised by R.  Levy and J.  Shapiro in an unpublished preprint. These questions concern the relationship between a space being cozero <b>complemented</b> and certain kinds of subspaces having this property, and between a product of two spaces being cozero <b>complemented</b> and the factor spaces being cozero <b>complemented.</b> Also, some conditions are given that guarantee that a space that is locally cozero <b>complemented</b> has this property globally. In this paper partial answers are given to these questions. Sample results: If X is weakly Lindelöf and dense in T, then X is cozero <b>complemented</b> iff T is cozero complemented; if X×Y is weakly Lindelöf and cozero <b>complemented,</b> then X and Y are cozero <b>complemented,</b> but if D is an uncountable discrete space, then βD×βD is not cozero <b>complemented</b> even though βD is cozero <b>complemented.</b> If X is locally cozero <b>complemented</b> and either weakly Lindelöf or paracompact, then X is cozero <b>complemented...</b>|$|R
