5|$|Historian Luis Alberto Sánchez writes that, after Morris {{closed his}} bar, {{some of his}} {{bartender}}s left to work in other locales.

As other former apprentices of Morris found other work, they also spread the pisco sour recipe. During the 1930s the drink made its way into California, reaching bars {{as far north as}} the <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco.</b> By at least the late 1960s the cocktail also found its way to New York.|$|E
