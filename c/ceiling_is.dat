5|$|Cave 15 {{is a small}} {{dwelling}} {{consisting of}} a cell with an unproved doorway and a veranda. Though the side walls of the cave are still preserved, the <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> half broken.|$|E
5|$|On a {{standard}} day where temperatures are 59°F (15°C), the AH-64 has a vertical {{rate of climb}} of 1,775 feet per minute (541 m/min), and a service ceiling of 21,000 feet (6,400 m). However, {{on a hot day}} where temperatures are 70°F (21°C), its vertical rate of climb is reduced to 1,595 fpm (486 m/min), and service <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> reduced to 19,400 feet (5,900 m) due to less dense air.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> {{that of the}} Sistine Chapel, {{the large}} papal chapel built within the Vatican between 1477 and 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV, for whom the chapel is named. It was painted at the {{commission}} of Pope Julius II. The chapel is the location for papal conclaves and many other important services.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} walls and <b>ceilings</b> <b>are</b> frescoed. The nave has three large frescoes enclosed in elaborate stucco. Additional decoration of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> added in 1895 by V. Gamba.|$|R
50|$|Ceiling height {{contributes}} to the atmosphere; low <b>ceilings</b> <b>are</b> homely, and high <b>ceilings</b> <b>are</b> theatrical. As English <b>ceilings</b> <b>are</b> generally low Muthesius outlines two methods of addressing soundproofing. The first involves inserting mineral wool between the ceiling beams, and the second, producing a shortened form of a double height ceiling. This involves the lower ceiling being constructed independently of, but positioned {{as close as possible}} to, the upper floor-bearing ceiling.|$|R
50|$|The station's <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{fitted with}} glass {{in order to}} let natural light in. It has green faience plaques and mosaic name tablets by Heins & LaFarge / Grueby Faience Company from 1904. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> also decorated with ornamental motifs.|$|R
5|$|There is {{an ornate}} {{semi-circular}} wooden ceiling with smaller panels along the ridge, moulded ribs and carved bosses, and brattished cornice each side above {{a row of}} little fan-vaults separating seven half-round panels with shield-bearing angels. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> finely finished with bosses {{at the intersection of}} the moulded principals and purlins. It was inserted in 1882–84.|$|E
5|$|Above is the Great Chamber, an {{impressive}} {{room with a}} barrel ceiling with geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte's arms and those of his wife, Edith Horsey. This <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> a rare survival. The wall above the bed displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses, signifying Lyte's loyalty to King Henry VIII (whose government Lyte represented in Somerset). The panelling is 17th century, as are the great four poster bed and the tapestries on the walls. Some of the original oak panelling of the room {{may have been used}} {{in the construction of the}} canopy of the bed.|$|E
5|$|The Ballroom, {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling, of such richness that it has been compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg. The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> supported by golden caryatids.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, {{the lobby}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> {{restored}} to its former glory by Evergreene Architectural Arts. The frescoes on the <b>ceiling</b> <b>were</b> based on Raphael's frescoes in Cardinal Bibbienna's Loggetta at the Vatican Palace. The style was recreated by artist Joseph Aruta in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|The nave's {{coloured}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> repainted in 1963 at the instigation of {{the then}} Vicar's wife, Mrs Barnett. During the restoration {{works in the}} 1960s a 15th-century carved and panelled <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> found above the side chapel which had been covered with plaster during the 18th or 19th centuries.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{walls and}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>are</b> lined with fibrous cement sheeting.|$|R
5|$|The large throne hall {{stands on}} a 50cm high base, the roof is covered in green and orange tiles. The {{pediment}} is decorated with a mural depicting the Hindu god Indra. The main central door is reserved for use by royalty, while others must enter through the adjacent side doors. Within the hall there are two rows of square columns, five {{on the left and}} six on the right, adorned with Thai floral designs. The coffered <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> decorated with glass mosaic stars.|$|E
5|$|The oblique roof {{covering}} the eastern {{facade of the}} Chiayi Station features a high-tech image. The generator room is decorated with horizontal shutters that reflect a minimalist style. The columns and truss system in the station imitate trees; as they extend toward {{the outside of the}} building, the artificial elements are integrated into nature. When night falls, the <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> lit with thousands of lights over the truss system, resembling a starry night over the branches of a forest.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical ceilings (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E

25|$|The {{outer walls}} were stone masonry construction, two feet thick. The inner walls and <b>ceilings</b> <b>were</b> hewn oak logs, {{about a foot}} square. There was about a foot of space between the outside masonry walls and the inside oak walls. This space and the space above the upper <b>ceiling</b> <b>were</b> filled with loose rock to {{discourage}} escape.|$|R
5|$|It has {{intricate}} carvings, with inscriptions in Quranic script. The mosque, in a walled enclosure, {{is made of}} interlocking coral blocks {{with its}} hypostyle roof supported by cut-coral columns. With three entrances, the mosque has two prayer halls surrounded by antechambers on three sides. Its vaulted, decorated <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> indented in steps. Local master carpenters, known as maavadikaleyge, fashioned the mosque's woodwork, roof and interior, and its wall panels and ceilings have many culturally-significant examples of traditional Maldivian woodcarving and lacquerwork. The mihrab, with a mimbar (pulpit) at one end, is a large chamber. The main building, used for daily prayers, {{is divided into three}} sections: the mihtab (used by the imam to lead the prayers), the medhu miskiy (the mosque's central area) and the fahu miskiy (the rear of the mosque). A long, carved 13th-century panel memorializes the introduction of Islam to Maldives.|$|E
5|$|The main {{family living}} {{quarters}} {{are located in}} the 1752 addition. The staircase hall is the only room in the 1752 house to have kept its original, Georgian interior. The rococo plaster <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> attributed to Shrewsbury-born architect, Thomas Farnolls Pritchard, who also designed interiors at Tatton Hall, Powis Castle and Croft Castle. Facing the gardens, {{on the north side of}} the house, is the library. Remodelled in the early 1800s, this room was previously used by the family as a dining room. It features fitted 19th-century mahogany bookcases, decorated with small acanthus friezes. The white marble fireplace is flanked on either side by family coats of arms. Connecting the library to the staircase hall and the drawing room is the ante-room, which is furnished with pieces commissioned by the family in the late 18th century. Originally, an entrance into the hall was located in this octagonal room, until Randle Wilbraham III relocated it. The room features copies of works by Raphael, attributed to Michelangelo Maestri.|$|E
5|$|The only intact public rooms {{remaining}} {{in either the}} stern or bow sections are the First-Class Reception Room and Dining Saloon, both on D-Deck. Most of the Dining Saloon has collapsed because of its proximity to the break-up point midships, but the very forward part is accessible and the rectangular leaded glass windows, table bases, and ceiling lamps are noticeably preserved. The Reception Room with its leaded glass windows and mahogany paneling remains remarkably intact, although the <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> sagging {{and there is a}} deep layer of silt obstructing the floor. The Turkish Baths on F-Deck were found to be in excellent condition during their rediscovery in 2005, preserving the blue-green tiles, carved teak woodwork, bronze lamps, and inlaid furniture. The Grand Staircase was very likely destroyed during the sinking, but the surrounding First-Class foyers and elevator entrances preserve many of the ormolu and crystal lamps, oak timbers, and oak-framed stanchions.|$|E

It also confirms that {{the recovery of the}} cost of technical advisers (experts) should not be restricted to where there is fault...|$|R
50|$|No <b>Ceilings</b> <b>is</b> a mixtape by American rapper Lil Wayne. It was {{scheduled}} to be released on October 31, 2009, but was leaked before the official date. No <b>Ceilings</b> <b>was</b> officially released on October 31 (Halloween), with 4 additional tracks. The mixtape is available as a free and legal download and it generally received positive reviews from critics.|$|R

5|$|This {{ability to}} provide {{real-time}} tissue loading data allows the computer to indicate the diver's current decompression obligation, and to update it for any permissible profile change, so the diver with a decompression ceiling {{does not have to}} decompress at any specific depth provided the <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> not violated, though the decompression rate will be affected by the depth. As a result, the diver can make a slower ascent than would be called for by a decompression schedule computed by the identical algorithm, as may suit the circumstances, and will be credited for gas elimination during the slower ascent, and penalized if necessary for additional ingassing for those tissues affected. This provides the diver with an unprecedented flexibility of dive profile while remaining within the safety envelope of the algorithm in use.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Wootton Hall is its pair of Italian black and Beschia marble blackamoor torchères, originally given to the First Duke of Marlborough as a present from General Charles Churchill. In exceptionally good condition, they stand {{either side of the}} door into the Saloon. These were discovered in the silt of the River Tiber and are depictions of slaves who once served in a Roman household. Several flags stand above them, including the White Ensign. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> intricately made, featuring flowers in the plaster, each one different, the work of Colen Campbell in the early 18th century. The black and white check marble floor is also a distinguishing {{feature of the}} room, but through most of its history this floor would have been left plain as horses and carriages would enter the hall inside. In the mid 19th century Frederick, the 4th Earl, had laid down brown and blue tiles, replaced by the marble floor which was added by his son Robert in around 1910. The floor gives significant depth to the hall and provides fine acoustics, so much that Diana would once practice her tap dancing in the hall as a teenager.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{the house}} had 16 {{bathrooms}} and 65 rooms, including 20 for servants. The house's main door opens into a square vaulted vestibule, walled throughout with highly polished yellow marble. It leads into the main hall, which is paneled to the ceiling in wood, painted white, the corners and angles accentuated by pilasters, and the rich mahogany doors encased within monumental frames. The white <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> intricately coffered. The hall has a large fireplace of carved white marble and a large table in the room's center, which was on a large red rug covering most of the floor. The main hall also featured Gobelins and Italian tapestries. The first floor also has an enfilade of three rooms: the green silk- and cedar-paneled living room, the white and gold drawing room, and the dark mahogany dining room. The three rooms have large doorways between them to allow hosts to combine rooms for a large event. The combined space has a span or linear distance of about 150 feet. A corridor connects the main hall to three rooms; it has recessed windows, dividing the corridor into bays. The corridor has pilasters and the same coffered ceiling of the main hall, and it used to have heavy velvet curtains at the window alcoves and entrance to the hallway; the windows had curtains of delicate salmon silk. The corridor originally displayed silk and velvet tapestries from {{various parts of the}} world.|$|E
50|$|Tin <b>ceilings</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} to North America as an affordable {{alternative to the}} exquisite plasterwork used in European homes. They gained popularity in the late 1800s as Americans sought sophisticated interior design. Durable, lightweight and fireproof, tin <b>ceilings</b> <b>were</b> appealing to home and business owners alike as a functionally attractive design element that was readily available.|$|R
50|$|The {{fire started}} in the ballroom's ceiling. The old <b>ceiling,</b> which <b>was</b> deemed a fire hazard, was not removed when the new <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> installed, {{providing}} kindling for the fire, which started from faulty wires.|$|R

5|$|Previously, the Sistine Chapel's only {{ventilation}} {{was from}} its {{windows in the}} upper level of the walls. To prevent exhaust fumes and wind-blown pollutants from entering, the windows are now permanently closed and an air conditioning system has been installed. The installation is by Carrier of the United Technologies Corporation and was developed {{with the cooperation of}} the Vatican's Office of Technical Services. It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel, in particular the rapid changes of heat and humidity that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists each morning and the departure of the last visitors each afternoon. The air conditioning varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually. The air near the <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> kept at a temperate level, while the air in the lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly, with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards. Bacteria and chemical pollutants are filtered out.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, with wooden pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a small wooden pulpit, which serves as a lectern that is accessible by a small wooden step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped with wooden crown molding. Wooden swag moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and the transom window. The wooden pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl space. Within the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|E
5|$|The mantapa is {{the hall}} where {{groups of people}} gather during prayers. The {{entrance}} to the mantapa normally has a highly ornate overhead lintel called a makaratorana (makara is an imaginary beast and torana is an overhead decoration). The open mantapa which serves the purpose of an outer hall (outer mantapa) is a regular feature in larger Hoysala temples leading to an inner small closed mantapa and the shrine(s). The open mantapas which are often spacious have seating areas (asana) made of stone with the mantapa's parapet wall acting as a back rest. The seats may follow the same staggered square shape of the parapet wall. The ceiling here is supported by numerous pillars that create many bays. The shape of the open mantapa is best described as staggered-square and is the style used in most Hoysala temples. Even the smallest open mantapa has 13 bays. The walls have parapets that have half pillars supporting the outer ends of the roof which allow plenty of light making all the sculptural details visible. The mantapa <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> generally ornate with sculptures, both mythological and floral. The ceiling consists of deep and domical surfaces and contains sculptural depictions of banana bud motifs and other such decorations.|$|E
