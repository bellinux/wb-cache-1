40|$|The {{possibility}} that tort law {{can be justified}} by an abstract norm of compensation has been summarily dismissed by tort scholars.

40|$|The {{molecular}} basis for heart failure is unknown, but oxidative stress {{is associated with}} the pathogenesis of the disease. We tested the hypothesis that the activity of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), a free-radical generating enzyme, increases in hypertrophied and failing heart. We studied XOR in two rat models: (1) The monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy and failure model; (2) coronary artery ligation induced heart failure, with left ventricular failure and <b>compensatory</b> <b>right</b> ventricular hypertrophy at different stages at 3 and 8 weeks post-infarction, respectively. XOR activity was measured at 30 degrees C and the reaction products were analysed by HPLC. In both models XOR activity in hypertrophic and control ventricles was similar. In the monocrotaline model, the hearts showed enhanced XOR activity in the failing right ventricle (65 +/- 5 mU/g w/w), as compared to that in the unaffected left ventricle (47 +/- 3 mU/g P< 0. 05, n= 6 - 7). In the coronary ligation model, XOR activities did not differ at 3 and 8 weeks. In the infarcted left ventricle, XOR activity increased from 29. 4 +/- 1. 4 mU/g (n= 6) in sham-operated rats, to 48 +/- 3 and 80 +/- 6 mU/g (n= 8 P< 0. 05 v sham) in the viable and infarcted parts of failing rat hearts, respectively. With affinity-purified polyclonal antibody, XOR was localized in CD 68 + inflammatory cells of which the number increased more in the failing than in sham-operated hearts. Our results show that the expression of functional XOR is elevated in failing but not in hypertrophic ventricles, suggesting its potential role in the transition from cardiac hypertrophy into failure...|$|E
40|$|In {{a seminal}} article written almost 50 years ago, Guido Calabresi {{explained}} that risk distribution is an ambiguous concept that {{can refer to}} {{the manner in which}} tort liability affects the allocation of scarce resources, the spreading of losses across society, or the attainment of normatively desirable distributive outcomes. The first two conceptions are combined in the (now) conventional economic analysis of tort law, a methodological approach that is routinely associated with Calabresi. In contrast, the remaining conception of risk distribution that Calabresi identified—the attainment of normatively desirable distributive outcomes—is not ordinarily associated with the economic analysis of tort law, and yet this conception is the one that Calabresi has repeatedly invoked as being of decisive importance. In doing so, Calabresi has described how economic analysis can inform distributive questions within tort law, although he never fully developed this approach. In this article, I try to carry Calabresi further by more rigorously showing how distributive economic analysis can be relevant to the normative evaluation of tort law. In contrast to Calabresi’s conclusion about the “pointlessness of Pareto,” I first argue that the Pareto principle embodies an autonomy-based compensatory norm that tort law can rely on to implement corrective justice under nonideal conditions that foreclose fully consensual compensatory exchanges. Within the context of these forced exchanges, a compensatory payment satisfies a compensatory obligation, which in turn is defined by the correlative <b>compensatory</b> <b>right.</b> Consequently, I next identify the substantive properties of a compensatory tort right and show how the right holder’s compensatory demands can be fully satisfied by the duty holder’s exercise of reasonable care {{in a wide range of}} cases. A compensatory norm can be fully implemented by the distribution of risk without an entitlement to compensatory damages in the event of injury, a conclusion that sheds new light on Calabresi’s original insight about the varied meanings of risk distribution within tort law. Finally, I employ distributive economic analysis to show how the tort system can be conceptualized as a compensatory mechanism. Tort compensation is not merely a form of accident insurance as assumed by the conventional economic analysis of tort law; it fits readily into Calabresi’s taxonomy of desirable legal innovations that shift the Pareto frontier outwards. By expanding the feasible set of fully compensatory outcomes that can be attained under existing social conditions, the tort system enables individuals to engage in new risky activities while adequately compensating those who are disadvantaged by the risky behavior. The tort system has a normative dimension that is brought into sharp relief by the type of distributive economic analysis that has been championed by Calabresi but neglected by the conventional economic analysis of tort law...|$|E

40|$|Abnormalities in the {{response}} of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to negative emotional stimuli have been reported in acutely depressed patients. However, there is a paucity of studies conducted in unmedicated individuals with major depressive disorder in remission (rMDD) to assess whether these are trait abnormalities. To address this issue, 19 medication-free rMDD individuals and 20 healthy comparison (HC) participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing an implicit emotion processing task in which they labeled the gender of faces depicting negative (fearful), positive (happy) and neutral facial expressions. The rMDD and HC groups were compared using a region-of-interest approach for two contrasts: fear vs. neutral and happy vs. neutral. Relative to HC, rMDD showed reduced activation in left OFC and DLPFC to fearful (vs. neutral) faces. Right DLPFC activation to fearful (vs. neutral) faces in the rMDD group showed a significant positive correlation with duration of euthymia. The findings support deficits in left OFC and DLPFC responses to negative emotional stimuli during euthymic periods of MDD, which may reflect trait markers of the illness or a 'scar' due to previous depression.

Results indicated weaker occipital to inferior-temporal connectivity for words in both dyslexic groups relative to TRs. Furthermore, SDDs exhibited stronger connectivity from left central to right inferior-temporal and occipital sites for words relative to TRs, and for false fonts relative to both MDDs and TRs. Importantly, reading fluency was positively related with forward and negatively with backward connectivity. Our results suggest disrupted visual processing of words in both dyslexic groups, together with a <b>compensatory</b> recruitment of <b>right</b> posterior brain regions especially in the SDDs during word and false font processing.

The E 4 allele is also associated with functional and structural grey matter (GM) changes in healthy young, middle-aged and older subjects. Here, we assess volumes of deep grey matter structures of 22 healthy younger ApoE 4 carriers and 22 non-carriers (20 – 38 years). Volumes of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, thalamus and brain stem were calculated by FMRIB’s Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST) algorithm. A significant drop in volume was found in the right hippocampus of ApoE 4 carriers (ApoE 4 +) relative to non-carriers (ApoE 42), while there was a borderline significant decrease in the volume of the left hippocampus of ApoE 4 carriers. The volumes of no other structures were found to be significantly affected by genotype. Atrophy {{has been found to be}} a sensitive marker of neurodegenerative changes, and our results show that within a healthy young population, the presence of the ApoE 4 + carrier gene leads to volume reduction in a structure that is vitally important for memory formation.

40|$|Structural and {{functional}} MRI studies {{of patients with}} post-stroke language deficits have contributed substantially {{to our understanding of}} how cognitive-behavioral impairments relate to the location of structural damage and to the activation of surviving brain regions during language processing, respectively. However, very little is known about how inter-patient variability in language task activation relates to variability in the structures affected by stroke. Here, we used parallel independent component analysis (pICA) to characterize links between patterns of structural damage and patterns of functional MRI activation during semantic decisions. The pICA analysis revealed a significant association between a lesion component featuring damage to left posterior temporo-parietal cortex and the underlying deep white matter and an fMRI component featuring (1) heightened activation in a primarily right hemispheric network of frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, and (2) reduced activation in areas associated with the semantic network activated by healthy controls. Stronger loading parameters on both the lesion and fMRI activation components were associated with poorer language test performance. Fiber tracking suggests that lesions affecting the left posterior temporo-parietal cortex and deep white matter may lead to the simultaneous disruption of multiple long-range structural pathways connecting distal language areas. Damage to the left posterior temporo-parietal cortex and underlying white matter may (1) impede the language task-driven recruitment of canonical left hemispheric language and other areas (e. g. the right anterior temporal lobe and default mode regions) that likely support residual language function after stroke, and (2) lead to the <b>compensatory</b> recruitment of <b>right</b> hemispheric fronto-temporo-parietal networks for tasks requiring semantic processing.

40|$|Introduction: Verbal echoes {{are commonplace}} in {{patients}} with aphasia, yet information on their cognitive and neural mechanisms remains unexplored (Berthier et al., in press). This study aims to instantiate the concept of echolalia (Berthier et al., 2016) by reappraising its relevance {{in the frame of}} modern neuroscience in three different types: (1) automatic echolalia (AE) (parrot-like repetition of all verbal stimuli); (2) mitigated echolalia (ME) (changes in echoes for communicative purposes), and (3) effortful echolalia (EE) (echolalia with articulatory struggling, distorted prosody, and increased effort). Methods: Case-series study of three variants of echolalia in three patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia using cognitive testing and multimodal imaging including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional MRI (fMRI) during repetition of words and non-words, and resting state fMRI (rsfMRI). Patient 1 had mixed transcortical aphasia (mutism and nil auditory comprehension with intact repetition). Patient 2 had residual Wernicke’s aphasia with mildly impaired auditory comprehension; and patient 3 had Broca’s aphasia with impaired syntactic comprehension. Results: Patient 1 had severe AE associated with two large lesions in the left dorsolateral and mesial frontal lobe and the left temporo-parietal cortex (isolation of speech area). DTI revealed absent left dorsal and ventral streams and full development of right white matter tracts. Using fMRI and rsfMRI a compensatory activity in both cerebral hemispheres (right greater than left) was found. Patient 2 had ME associated with DTI-proven incomplete damage to the left dorsal stream and complete damaged to the left ventral stream. fMRI and rsfMRI revealed <b>compensatory</b> activity via <b>right</b> hemisphere structures. Patient 3 had EE associated to a large lesion in the left perisylvian language core. Discussion:Our study revealed heterogeneous aphasic profiles and cognitive deficits in the different types of echolalia amongst patients with chronic aphasia. In addition, multimodal imaging showed a complex pattern of network rearrangement in both cerebral hemispheres which depended upon the localization of the structural lesion. Our preliminary findings set out a starting point to advance research on echolalia eventually providing hints for neurorehabilitation. References: Berthier ML et al [...] P. Coppens and J.

40|$|The {{claim for}} damages is an {{effective}} sanction to react to infringements of intellectual property rights like patents, utility models, designs, copyrights and trademarks. Article 125 of the Italian Industrial Property Code expressly provides the obligation of the infringer to pay the rightholder damages to compensate the injury suffered. Damage claims in this field are not governed by the same principles which run for different property rights. The italian Supreme Court held that the right-holder can choose among three methods {{for the assessment of}} the damages suffered: 1. actual damages, including lost profits; 2. the royalty which is normally paid by a licensee; 3. the profits obtained by the infringer. Under the new Code the right-holder can elect two different remedies, a wrong one –with the three methods - and a restitutionary one, in which the basic principle is restitution and not wrong or tort, because the remedy is provided even though the infringement is not wilfully or negligently committed, and the infringer can deduct a portion of his general overheads allocated to the production and marketing of the infringing product. The claimant can award either damages and the recovery of profits which are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account when calculating the compensatory damages. The claim is a restitutionary one and not only, or not always, a tort: or, as common law courts say, the award is not (or not only) for its loss but for an account of the profits made by the defendant {{as a result of the}} infringement. We cannot assume that all of the profits will be awarded, and so the problem, under a legal framework like the one designed by the european directives, is more and more how the profits have to be calculated. It can be assumed that in the future a right-holder will more often choose the restitutionary remedy to recover all the profits made by the infringer which are attributable to the infringement and which are not taken into account when calculating the <b>compensatory</b> damages. The <b>right</b> holder cannot recover the profits attributable to factors other than the protected property right. Whereas under English law the claimant must make an election between damages and account of profits, under the new italian Code, a successful claimant can award both damages and restitutionary remedy, to strip the defendant of its gains: the defendant is entitled to deduct from its profits certain costs incurred and must only account for the profits made as a result of the wrongdoing...|$|R

Any other clinical observations are unknown. The pathologico-anatomical diagnosis of the heart follows; Peristent truncus arteriosus communis, partial type (Humphreys); Basal defect of ventricular septum with some small holes in its muscular portion; Patent foramen ovale (small slit); High grade compensatory hypertrophy of the right ventricle. Case 2 (Fig. 2, 3, Schema 2, 4) A 29 month old Japanese Black Breed cow. Body length 1. 1 m., Height 1. 1 m., Weight 165 kg. Middle sized stature. Nutrition was not so bad. It staggered at walking and seemed slightly atactic. Conjunctiva was more or less cyanotic. Hair appeared rather dull and ruffled. It was easily excitable even by slight stimuli, the heart having been accelerated and palpable with fingers. Heartsounds were increased in intensity and intracardial murmurs were noted. Frequent but weak pulsation counted 66 p. m. The jugnlar vein pulsation was remarkable. The respiartion was also accelerated by stimuli, resulting labored respiration or dyspnoe. The blood was dark red in color, Hb 43 %, Red corpuscles 4, 580, 000, Leucocytes 5, 200. The urine was straw-yellow, clear, spec. grav. 1, 022, Albumin (±), Sugar (-), Bilirubin (-), Hb (-). Clinical investigation shows easy excitability with accelerated respiration even when any one draws near. It dislikes physical movement, and after being forced into light walking it gives rise to dyspnoe, markedly frequent pulsation which results in dropping on the knee with dizziness, severe dyspnoe, jugular vein pulsation and marked acceleration of heart beats. The pathologico-anatomical diagnosis of the heart follows: Basal defect of the ventricular septum; Dextroposition of the dilated and hypertrophic aorta ("Rider" position); Sinistropositon of the hypoplastic pulmonary artery; Patent ductus Botalli (Adossement ALMAGROS or Type b in the classification after Vierordt); Patent foramen ovale; Partial abnormal course of heart artery and vein; <b>Compensatory</b> hypertrophy of <b>right</b> ventricle.

I recall no mortal note--nothing but the bright extravagance of her envy; and see her again, in the old-time Pelham parlours, ever so erectly slight and so more than needfully, so transparently, fair (I fatuously took this for [...] "becoming"), glide as swiftly, toss her head as characteristically, laugh to as free a disclosure of the handsome largeish teeth that made her mouth almost the main fact of her face, as if no corner of the veil of the future had been lifted. The house was quiet and spacious for the day, after the manner of all American houses of that age at those hours, and yet spoke of such a possible muster at need of generous, gregarious, neighbouring, sympathising Emmets; in spite of which, withal, the impression was to come back to me as of a child struggling with her ignorance in a sort of pathless desert of the genial and the casual. Three months before I returned to America the struggle had ended. I was, as happened, soon to see in London her admiration, and my own, the great George Eliot--a brief glimpse then, but a very impressive, and wellnigh my main satisfaction in which was that I should have my cousin to tell of it. I found the Charles Nortons settled for the time in London, with social contacts and penetrations, a give and take of hospitality, that I felt as wondrous and of some elements of which they offered me, in their great kindness, the benefit; so that I was long to value having owed them in the springtime of '69 five separate impressions of distinguished persons, then in the full flush of activity and authority, that affected my young provincialism as a positive fairytale of privilege. I had a Sunday afternoon hour with Mrs. Lewes at North Bank, no second visitor but my gentle introducer, the younger Miss Norton, sharing the revelation, which had some odd and for myself peculiarly thrilling accompaniments; and then the opportunity of dining with Mr. Ruskin at Denmark Hill, an impression of uneffaced intensity and followed by a like--and yet so unlike--evening of hospitality from William Morris in the medieval mise-en-scène of Queen Square. This had been preceded by a luncheon with Charles Darwin, beautifully benignant, sublimely simple, at Down; a memory to which I find attached our incidental wondrous walk--Mrs. Charles Norton, the too near term of her earthly span then smoothly out of sight, being my guide for the happy excursion--across a private park of great oaks, which I conceive to have been the admirable Holwood and where I knew my first sense of a matter afterwards, through fortunate years, to be more fully disclosed: the springtime in such places, the adored footpath, the first primroses, the stir and scent of renascence in the watered sunshine and under spreading boughs that were somehow before aught else the still reach of remembered lines of Tennyson, ached over in nostalgic years. The rarest hour of all perhaps, or at least the strangest, strange verily to the pitch of the sinister, was a vision, provided by the same care, of D. G. Rossetti in the vernal dusk of Queen's House Chelsea--among his pictures, amid his poetry itself, his whole haunting [...] "esthetic," [...] and yet above all bristling with his personality, with his perversity, with anything, as it rather awfully seemed to me, but his sympathy, though {{it at the same time}} left one oddly desirous of more of him. These impressions heaped up the measure, goodness knew, of what would serve for Minnie's curiosity--she was familiarly Minnie to us; the point remaining all along, however, that, impatient at having overmuch to wait, I rejoiced in possession of the exact vivid terms in which I should image George Eliot to her. I was much later on to renew acquaintance with that great lady, but I think I scarce exceed in saying that with my so interested cousin's death half the savour of my appreciation had lost itself. Just in those days, that month of April, the latter had made a weak ineffectual move to Philadelphia in quest of physical relief--which expressed at the same time even more one of those reachings out for appeasement of the soul which were never too publicly indulged in, but by which her power to interest the true subjects of her attraction was infinitely quickened. It represented wonderments, I might well indeed have said to myself, even beyond any inspired by the high muse of North Bank.|$|R
