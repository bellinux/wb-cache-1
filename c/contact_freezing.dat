40|$|The {{aim of this}} work, was to {{investigate}} the heterogeneous ice nucleation of supercooled micro-droplets induced by contact with an ice nucleating particle (INP). The <b>contact</b> <b>freezing</b> is poorly quantified but can be potentially important for understanding precipitation mechanisms via cloud glaciation in mixed clouds. The <b>contact</b> <b>freezing</b> results are compared to results of freezing experiments in the immersion mode. The same INP is ice active at higher temperatures in the contact mode than in the immersion mode. An electrodynamic balance was used to levitate single, supercooled micro-droplets of deionized water. The droplet is exposed to a flow of mobility-selected aerosol particles. The injection of droplets and the detection of freezing events is automated. In this experiment, it is possible to calculate the collision rate separately, and the probability of freezing on a single contact. Furthermore, immersion freezing experiments are performed in the same experimental setup, and a direct comparison between immersion and contact mode is possible.

40|$|Ice {{nucleating}} particles (INPs) in {{the atmosphere}} are responsible for glaciating cloud droplets between 237 and 273  K. Different mechanisms of heterogeneous ice nucleation can compete under mixed-phase cloud conditions. <b>Contact</b> <b>freezing</b> is considered relevant because higher ice nucleation temperatures than for immersion freezing for the same INPs were observed. It has limitations because its efficiency depends {{on the number of}} collisions between cloud droplets and INPs. To date, direct comparisons of contact and immersion freezing with the same INP, for similar residence times and concentrations, are lacking. This study compares immersion and <b>contact</b> <b>freezing</b> efficiencies of three different INPs. The <b>contact</b> <b>freezing</b> data were obtained with the ETH CoLlision Ice Nucleation CHamber (CLINCH) using 80  µm diameter droplets, which can interact with INPs for residence times of 2 and 4  s in the chamber. The <b>contact</b> <b>freezing</b> efficiency was calculated by estimating the number of collisions between droplets and particles. Theoretical formulations of collision efficiencies gave too high freezing efficiencies for all investigated INPs, namely AgI particles with 200  nm electrical mobility diameter, 400 and 800  nm diameter Arizona Test Dust (ATD) and kaolinite particles. Comparison of freezing efficiencies by contact and immersion freezing is therefore limited by the accuracy of collision efficiencies. The concentration of particles was 1000  cm − 3 for ATD and kaolinite and 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000  cm − 3 for AgI. For concentrations [*]<[*]  5000  cm − 3, the droplets collect only one particle on average during their time in the chamber. For ATD and kaolinite particles, <b>contact</b> <b>freezing</b> efficiencies at 2  s residence time were smaller than at 4  s, which is in disagreement with a collisional <b>contact</b> <b>freezing</b> process but in accordance with immersion freezing or adhesion freezing. With “adhesion freezing”, we refer to a contact nucleation process that is enhanced compared to immersion freezing due to the position of the INP on the droplet, and we discriminate it from collisional <b>contact</b> <b>freezing,</b> which assumes an enhancement due to the collision of the particle with the droplet. For best comparison with <b>contact</b> <b>freezing</b> results, immersion freezing experiments of the same INPs were performed with the continuous flow diffusion chamber Immersion Mode Cooling chAmber–Zurich Ice Nucleation Chamber (IMCA–ZINC) for a 3  s residence time. In IMCA–ZINC, each INP is activated into a droplet in IMCA and provides its surface for ice nucleation in the ZINC chamber. The comparison of contact and immersion freezing results did not confirm a general enhancement of freezing efficiency for contact compared with immersion freezing experiments. For AgI particles the onset of heterogeneous freezing in CLINCH was even shifted to lower temperatures compared with IMCA–ZINC. For ATD, freezing efficiencies for contact and immersion freezing experiments were similar.

Heterogeneous nucleation can occur through several <b>freezing</b> mechanisms, including <b>contact</b> and immersion <b>freezing.</b> The {{mechanism by which}} this freezing occurs depends on the ambient conditions and composition of the IN. Aerosol properties change through chemical aging and reactions with atmospheric oxidants such as ozone. We have {{conducted a series of}} laboratory experiments using an optical microscope apparatus equipped with a cooling stage to determine how chemical oxidation changes the ability of atmospheric aerosols to act as IN. Freezing temperatures are reported for aerosols composed of fresh and oxidized soot and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) including anthracene, phenanthrene, and pyrene. Our results show that oxidized soot particles initiate ice freezing events at significantly warmer temperatures than fresh soot, 3 ?C on average. All oxidized PAHs studied had significantly warmer freezing temperatures than fresh samples. The chemical changes presumably causing the improved ice nucleation efficiency were observed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy with Horizontal Attenuated Total Reflectance (FTIR-HATR). The addition of C=O bonds at the surface of the soot and PAHs led to changes in freezing temperatures. Finally, we have used classical nucleation theory to derive heterogeneous nucleation rates for the IN compositions in this research. The overall efficiency of the IN can be compared in order of least efficient to most efficient: fresh phenanthrene, fresh anthracene, fresh soot, oxidized phenanthrene, fresh pyrene, oxidized anthracene, oxidized soot, and oxidized pyrene.

However, the experimental quantification of <b>contact</b> <b>freezing</b> is challenging. Here we report an experimental method allowing to determine the temperature dependent ice nucleation probability of size selected aerosol particles. The method uses supercooled charged water droplets suspended in a laminar flow of air containing aerosol particles as <b>contact</b> <b>freezing</b> nuclei. The rate of droplet–particle collisions is calculated numerically with account for Coulomb attraction, drag force and induced dipole interaction between charged droplet and aerosol particles. The calculation is verified by direct counting of aerosol particles collected by a levitated droplet. By repeating the experiment on individual droplets for a sufficient number of times, we are able to reproduce the statistical freezing behavior of a large ensemble of supercooled droplets and measure the average rate of freezing events. The freezing rate is equal to the product of the droplet–particle collision rate and the probability of freezing on a single contact, the latter being a function of temperature, size and composition of the contact ice nuclei.

The modified microphysical scheme was embedded in an adiabatic air parcel model with entrainment. Sensitivity studies were performed to simulate convective situations and to investigate the impact of ice nuclei concentrations and types on ice formation. As a central diagnostic parameter, the ice water fraction (IWF) was selected, which is the relation of the ice water content to the total amount of water in the condensed form. The following parameters were varied: initial aerosol particle number size distributions, types of ice nucleating particles, final temperature, and the fractions of potential ice nucleating particles. Single and coupled freezing processes were investigated. The results show that immersion freezing seems to be the most efficient process. <b>Contact</b> <b>freezing</b> is constrained by the collision kernel between supercooled drops and potential ice nucleating particles.

40|$|High matte {{temperatures}} can {{be related}} to numerous catastrophic furnace failures in the platinum group metal (PGM) industry where chromite-rich upper group 2 (UG 2) concentrates are smelted. Chromite rich concentrates require high slag temperatures as well as sufficient mixing to suspend the chromite spinel particles in the slag and prevent settling in a so-called "mushy" layer consisting of a three phase emulsion of slag, matte and chromite particles. To achieve sufficient bath mixing and to melt and suspend chromite spinel build-up, high hearth power densities are utilised. However, high hearth power densities in conjunction with a heat-isolating concentrate layer, leads to high side wall heat fluxes which motivated the use of intensive cooling in the furnace side wall so that a slag freeze lining can be formed. If matte temperatures are above the slag liquidus temperature, any matte that comes into <b>contact</b> with the <b>freeze</b> lining can destroy the freeze lining. Moreover, if the matte temperature exceeds ca. 1500 °C, chemical thermodynamics indicate that matte has the ability to sulfidise MgO-FexO-Cr 2 O 3 refractories, leading to rapid wear of refractories exposed to high temperature flowing matte. Models are derived for the concentrate-to-matte and slag-to-matte droplet heat transfer. Calculations using the derived models, physical properties and furnace operating conditions give realistic matte temperatures and show that matte temperatures rapidly increase as the concentrate bed becomes matte drainage rate limiting. It is shown that for each concentrate blend mean particle size and mineralogy, there is a maximum smelting rate above which the concentrate bed becomes rate limiting with regards matte drainage, thereby significantly contributing to matte preheating, prior to further heat absorption from the slag layer. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation with the ARC-Adv-CB {{as well as the}} merits of a predictor of PNP. METHODS: AF ablation was performed by using a "single 28 -mm big CB" approach. The rate of pulmonary vein (PV) isolation with a first cryoapplication was measured. The distance between the CB and a PN pacing catheter in the superior vena cava was measured to predict PNP during freezing. RESULTS: In 147 patients, PV were isolated with a single cryoapplication in 205 (81. 3 %) of 252 PV treated with the ARC-CB and in 280 (90. 3 %) of 310 PV treated with the ARC-Adv-CB (P =. 003). The mean time to PV isolation was 52 ± 34 seconds and 40 ± 25 seconds (P <. 001) and the temperature at the time of isolation was - 36. 1 ± 10. 3 °C and - 32. 3 ± 10. 2 °C (P =. 001) in the ARC-CB and ARC-Adv-CB groups, respectively.

Liquid crystal composites are however colloidal dispersions which have very specificproperties compared to the usual colloidal dispersions in simple liquids. LC matrices give indeed rise to longrangeattractive multipolar interactions between colloidal dispersions [1]. Strong dipolar interactions are mainlyobserved at large scale, but even at the nanometer scale the interactions between two nanoparticles arequadrupolar, weaker but often sufficient to yield aggregates in many systems [1]. Aggregation phenomena undersuch multipolar interactions are still not fully understood, so to get a deeper understanding we have considered a 2 D model system describing the classical dynamics of elongated particles at a liquid interface. When elongated particles are trapped at a liquid interface they distort it and then interact via quadrupolarcapillary interactions. Furthermore the interactions between a group of already aggregated particles and a singleone located at a large distance strongly depend on the spatial arrangement of the aggregated particles. Thisphenomenon is further complicated by the presence of possible direct solid-solid interactions, which would arisewhen the particles enter into <b>contact</b> and possibly <b>freeze</b> the aggregate shapes.

HBID process is not significantly influenced by impurities such as the concentration of ion or organic matters,It has huge advantage to be utilized as the preconditioning process of membrane separation when treating high salinity waste water such as RO brineand Shale gas drawback water. In the case of cation analysis every cation rejection is higer than 50 %. It also have more than 50 % of performance in treatment efficiency of B 3 + with the highest difficulties in treatment so they can be easily utilized in the front side of RO. Therefore, the development of HBID technology can be utilized alone in the process of seawater desalination or waste water treatment to contribute to generating pure water and decreasing the volume of waste water such as RO brine. clos...|$|E
40|$|Formation {{of ice in}} Earth's {{atmosphere}} at temperatures above approximately − 20 &deg;C {{is one of the}} outstanding problems in cloud physics. Contact nucleation has been suggested as a possible mechanism for freezing at relatively high temperatures; some laboratory experiments have shown <b>contact</b> <b>freezing</b> activity at temperatures as high as − 4 &deg;C. We have investigated Arizona Test Dust and kaolinite as contact nuclei as a function of size and temperature and find that the fraction of submicron particles that are active as contact ice nuclei is less than 10 &minus; 3 for − 18 &deg;C and greater. We also find that the different dusts are quite distinct in their effectiveness as contact nuclei; Arizona Test Dust catalyzed freezing in the contact mode at all mobility diameters we tested at − 18 &deg;C whereas kaolinite triggered freezing only for mobility diameters of 1000 and 500 nm at that temperature...|$|E
40|$|In deep {{convective}} clouds, {{heavy rain}} is often formed involving the ice phase as essential process. Simulations were performed using the 3 D cloud resolving model COSMO-SPECS with detailed spectral microphysics including parametrizations of homogeneous and three heterogeneous freezing modes. The initial conditions {{were selected to}} result in a deep convective cloud reaching 14  km altitude with strong updrafts up to 40  m/s. In such altitudes with corresponding temperatures below − 40  °C the major fraction of liquid drops freezes homogeneously. The goal of the present model simulations was to investigate how additional heterogeneous freezing will affect ice formation and precipitation although its contribution to total ice formation may be rather low. In such a situation small perturbations which do not show significant effects at first sight may trigger cloud microphysical responses. Effects of the following small perturbations were studied: (1) additional ice formation via immersion, contact, and deposition modes in comparison to sole homogeneous <b>freezing,</b> (2) <b>contact</b> and deposition <b>freezing</b> in comparison to immersion freezing, (3) small fractions of biological ice nucleating particles (INP) in comparison to higher fractions of mineral dust INP. The results indicate that the modification of precipitation proceeds via the formation of larger ice particles which may be supported by direct freezing of larger drops, the growth of pristine ice particles by riming, and by nucleation of larger drops by collisions with pristine ice particles. In comparison to the reference case homogeneous freezing such small perturbations may affect an enhancement of total precipitation but mostly the effects are limited to modifications of the temporal development of precipitation, i. e. a gradual increase already at early cloud stages instead a strong increase at later cloud stages. These effects are coupled with changes in the local distribution of precipitation, i. e. approximately 50  % more precipitation in the cloud center. The modifications depend on the active freezing modes, the fractions of active INP, and the composition of the internal mixtures in the drops...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this program {{is to develop a}} basic {{understanding}} of how a molten material front spreads over a solid that is below its melting point, arrests, and freezes. Our hope is that the work will contribute toward a scientific knowledge base for certain new applications involving molten droplet deposition, including the "printing" of arbitrary three-dimensional objects by precise deposition of individual molten microdrops that solidify after impact. Little information is available at this time on the capillarity-driven motion and arrest of molten contact line regions. Schiaffino and Sonin investigated the arrest of the contact line of a molten microcrystalline wax spreading over a subcooled solid "target" of the same material. They found that contact line arrest takes place at an apparent liquid contact angle that depends primarily on the Stefan number S=c(T(sub f) -T(sub t) /L based on the temperature difference between the fusion point and the target temperature, and proposed that contact line arrest occurs when the liquid's dynamic contact angle approaches the angle of attack of the solidification front just behind the contact line. They also showed, however, that the conventional continuum equations and boundary conditions have no meaningful solution for this angle. The solidification front angle is determined by the heat flux just behind the contact line, and the heat flux is singular at that point. By comparing experiments with numerical computations, Schiaffino and Sonin estimated that the conventional solidification model must break down within a distance of order 0. 1 - 1 microns of the contact line. The physical mechanism for this breakdown is as yet undetermined, and no first-principles theory exists for the contact angle at arrest. Schiaffino and Sonin also presented a framework for understanding how to moderate Weber number molten droplet deposition in terms of similarity laws and experimentation. The study is based on experiments with three molten materials- molten wax on solid wax, water on ice, and mercury on frozen mercury- which between them span a considerable range of the deposition/solidification similarity parameters. Correlations are obtained for the spreading velocity, spreading time scales, the spreading factor (i. e. ratio of deposited drop's final footprint radius and the drop's initial radius), post-spreading liquid oscillation amplitudes and time scales, and bulk solidification time scales. Duthaler carried out an experimental and theoretical investigation {{of the relationship between the}} liquid's apparent contact angle and the Capillary number Ca=mu U/sigma based on contact line speed, for molten materials spreading over subcooled solids. This relationship is required for modeling of melt spreading. We have adapted Voinov's methodology to the molten contact line and formulated a theoretical model for the Ca vs. contact angle relationship, based Schiaffino and Sonin#s (1997 a,b) wedge-like solidification front model. With the solidification front angle taken from Schiaffino and Sonin, the model is in good agreement with the experimental results for Ca vs. contact angle. Duthaler also extended the experimental investigation of droplet deposition and <b>contact</b> line <b>freezing</b> to more materials, including solder on glass, solder on solder, water on ice, and molten microcrystalline wax on wax. The latter also included tests on inclined targets. Deposition tests have also been done with molten octacosane (C 28 H 58) on various targets. An important objective of our program has been the development of micron-scale sensors for measuring the transient temperature at a point on the substrate surface as a molten contact line moves over it. The expectation is that this temperature history will yield a better understanding of the thermal process in the contact line region. The sensors are of the thermistor type, either 2. 5 microns or 1. 5 microns square, microfabricated with silicon-based technology on either pure silicon or amorphous silicon dioxide chips. Each chip has 32 sensors distributed on its surface in arrays. The time response is better than 10 ms. At the time of writing, sensor calibration is in progress. Results on thermal transients during contact line passage will be discussed at the conference. While we expect that the data will provide information on the near-contact-line heat transfer process, we also foresee possible problems. First, the spatial resolution of the sensors may be insufficient to resolve the near-contact-line region. Second, the sensors protrude about 0. 5 microns above the substrate surface, and may affect the contact line motion. Third, a sensor's temperature history depends on both the heat flux distribution into it from the fusion front and the thermal properties of the substrate below it and the solidified melt between it and the fusion front. The heat flux distribution in the contact line region must therefore be unfolded from computations of the overall system's transient thermal response...|$|R
40|$|Formation of {{orographic}} {{clouds and}} snowfall over Funka Bay during cold air outbreaks were simulated {{by using the}} three dimensional non-hydrostatic mesoscale model GESIMA (Geesthacht Simulation Model of the Atmosphere). A new cloud module is presented and discussed. The cloud scheme utilizes the 'bulk water' mircophysical parameterization technique. The snow filed is resulting by simulation of six forms of water substance (water vapor, cloud water, cloud ice, rain, snow and graupel). The primary ice-nucleation concept is based on combining the effects of deposition and condensation-freezing nucleation as a simple function of supersaturation. A new formula for contact-freezing nucleation also is used assuming aerosols with 0. 1 #mu#m as potential contact nuclei. The snow precipitation event without graupel and with pristine ice field in the cloud scheme resulting from the combined temperature and supersaturation dependent formulation, and <b>contact</b> <b>freezing</b> nucleation produced through larger aerosols is examined also in GESIMA (Part 1) and compared with the results with the new cloud moduleSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: RA 3251 (99 /E/ 25) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekDEGerman...|$|E
