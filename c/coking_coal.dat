5|$|The {{construction}} of the railways in the mid-19th century made the Lake District, and Keswick in particular, more accessible to visitors of modest means. The original impetus for building the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway (CKP) line came from heavy industry: the new Bessemer process of steelmaking brought a great demand for the rich iron ore from west Cumberland and the <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> from Durham {{on the east side}} of the country. The CKP was built to enable ore and coal to be brought together at steel foundries in both counties. The line opened for goods traffic in 1864, and the following year it began to carry passengers. Fares varied, but holidaymakers could buy excursion tickets at discounted prices, such as six shillings for the 170-mile return journey from Preston to Keswick.|$|E
5|$|Canada {{is one of}} the few {{developed}} nations that are net exporters of energy. Atlantic Canada possesses vast offshore deposits of natural gas, and Alberta also hosts large oil and gas resources. The vastness of the Athabasca oil sands and other assets results in Canada having a 13% share of global oil reserves, comprising the world's third-largest share after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies are one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains. Canada's Ministry of Natural Resources provides statistics regarding its major exports; the country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, aluminum, steel, iron ore, <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> and lead. Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustainable because of nearby mines or sources of timber. Canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.|$|E
5|$|TCI was {{not fully}} {{incorporated}} into U. S. Steel, {{and continued to}} operate as an extremely profitable subsidiary of its parent company well into the 20th century. Immediately following the merger, a venture was launched to create a new, larger TCI plant {{to the west of}} Ensley and {{at the center of a}} new company town, and so in 1910 work on the planned community of Corey, Alabama, began. Named after an executive who later committed suicide, Corey was soon renamed Fairfield, and the steel works there opened in 1917. With the discovery of new <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> and ore deposits in the region, and with the aid of U. S. Steel's enormous capital, the Fairfield works were quickly expanded with the construction of new steel mills and rail links. Several rolling mills were completed in 1917, which produced ship materials for the nearby shipbuilding plants in Chickasaw, Alabama, in support of America's sudden entry into World War I. In 1920 a direct rail line between Fairfield and Birmingport, the new port of Birmingham on the Warrior River was opened. This was followed by the completion of the 'High Ore Line Railroad', which connected the Red Mountain and the Fairfield works; trains literally rolled down the hill from mine to mill. In 1923 a merchant steel mill was completed, followed by the opening of a sheet products mill in 1926.|$|E
30|$|Rank {{and type}} of coal are {{fundamental}} factors that control coal characteristics such as the coking properties {{as well as other}} numerous technological applications[3]. The effort to source for <b>coking</b> <b>coals,</b> for Nigerian iron and steel industries, has led to the evaluation of coal deposits {{in different parts of the}} country; it was discovered that majority of the Nigerian coals are sub-bituminous and lignitic in rank[4, 5]. The coals that were explored and documented are lignites of high volatile matter content, weakly <b>coking</b> <b>coals</b> and medium-coking coals[6]. Therefore, most Nigerian coals are known to be non-coking, but some of them can be blended to obtain blast furnace coke[7, 8, 9].|$|R
40|$|Given {{the high}} costs and general {{shortage}} of <b>coking</b> <b>coals</b> on the domestic and international markets, and because the nature and qualities {{of many of the}} <b>coking</b> <b>coals</b> available on the markets are themselves mixed products, conventional mechanisms and tried and trusted formulae for manufacturing coke products based on single coals of known qualities can no longer apply. There is therefore an urgent need to develop more effective techniques for evaluating and assessing the properties of individual coals rapidly and reliably and in a manner that could provide useful data for use in modelling the effect of new coal components in a coke blend. Towards this end, the current research has sought to find more accurate coal characterisation techniques at laboratory scale than currently exists in industry at present. Seventeen coking or blend <b>coking</b> <b>coals</b> from widely different sources were selected and cokes were produced from them in as close to full scale conventional conditions as possible. Both coals and cokes were analysed using conventional chemical, physical, petrographic and rheological coking methods. The results indicated that, whilst all coals had acceptable chemical, physical and petrographic properties as evaluated on individual parameters thereby indicating their potential values as prime <b>coking</b> <b>coals,</b> in fact the resultant cokes of some of the coals had properties that disproved this assessment. These anomalies were investigated by integrating all characteristics and statistically evaluating them. The result [outcome] indicated that the series of coals under review fall naturally into three distinct categories according to rank, as determined by the reflectance of vitrinite, and that the <b>coking</b> <b>coals</b> in each rank category were further characterised by parameters specific to that level of rank. In this way more accurate predictions of coke quality were obtained than has been the case to date when using single set evaluations or previously devised formulae. On this basis it was concluded that, when selecting coals for coke making, it is essential to first establish the rank of the coal by vitrinite reflectance and then to apply coke evaluating parameters specific to that level of rank. The formulae developed for this purpose held good for all coals tested, however, {{it remains to be seen}} whether this applies universally to an even wider source of coals...|$|R

5|$|The {{coal mining}} {{industry}} of the Rhondda was artificially buoyed {{throughout the war}} years, though there were expectations {{of a return to}} the pre-1939 industrial collapse {{after the end of the}} Second World War. There was a sense of salvation when the government announced the nationalisation of the British Coalmines in 1947; but the following decades saw a continual reduction in the output from the Rhondda mines. From 15,000 miners in 1947, Rhondda had just a single pit within the valleys producing coal in 1984, located at Maerdy. The decline in the mining of coal after World War II was a country wide issue, but South Wales and Rhondda were affected to a higher degree than other areas of Britain. Oil had superseded coal as the fuel of choice in many industries and there was political pressure influencing the supply of oil. Of the few industries that were still reliant on coal, the demand was for quality coals, especially <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> which was required by the steel industry. Fifty percent of Glamorgan coal was now supplied to steelworks, with the second biggest market being domestic heating, which the 'smokeless' coal of the Rhondda became once again fashionable after the publication of the Clean Air Act. These two markets now controlled the fate of the mines in the Rhondda, and as demand fell from both sectors the knock-on effect on the mining industry was further contraction. In addition exports to other areas of Europe, traditionally France, Italy and the Low Countries, experienced a massive decline; from 33 per cent around the start of the 20th century to roughly 5 per cent by 1980.|$|E

40|$|Compositional transformations {{occurring}} during natural coalification generally lead {{to increased}} <b>coking</b> potential of <b>coals</b> characterised in the resulting cokes by large sizes of molecular orientation domains (MOD) determined through transmission electron microscopy with 002 dark field mode. In this study, two sets of perhydrous low-rank vitrains (WJV and UCV) have been pyrolysed using an open-system with two heating rates {{in an attempt to}} increase their coking potential. Results show that, despite the high potentialities of such vitrains for producing hydrocarbons, i. e. a suspensive medium efficient for their cokefaction, each of the pyrolysis methods does not lead to solid residues chemically equivalent to natural <b>coking</b> <b>coals,</b> since the cokes from these residues are always made of smaller MOD than those obtained for <b>coking</b> <b>coals.</b> For comparison, a similar characterisation, carried out on a conventional vitrain (Fouthiaux) pyrolysed in a confined-system which prevents the release of hydrocarbons, leads also to non-coking coals.

40|$|International audienceThe {{addition}} of biomass to coking blends {{has the potential}} benefits of reducing the amount of expensive <b>coking</b> <b>coals</b> and reducing carbon emissions. However, there is little research in the use of biomass as additive in coking blends. The easily available biomass samples pine wood, sugar beet, and miscanthus have been chosen to study the effect of these additives on the fluidity properties of coal. High-temperature small-amplitude oscillatory-shear (SAOS) rheometry was used to determine the fluidity of the samples as a function of temperature. TGA and solid-state C- 13 NMR were also used to determine the thermal stability and compositional changes in the samples during pyrolysis. Sugar beet can be added in coking blends up to 5 wt % without altering the viscoelastic properties of the coal, whereas pine wood and miscanthus reduce the fluidity even with 2 wt % additions. No solid solid interactions were observed in the blends, but there were differences in viscoelastic behavior that were attributed to gas solid interactions. Fast heating (i. e., 180 degrees C/min) can facilitate the incorporation of pine wood and miscanthus in coking blends. The use of fast heating increases the fluidity of the coal and preserves the fluid material in the biomass at higher temperatures. As a result, the biomass acts as a regulator of fluid material development in the coal, and the viscoelastic properties of the blend are identical to those of prime <b>coking</b> <b>coals.</b> Although fast heating could also be used to produce good coking blends by combining biomass with high volatile matter, high fluidity coals, the amount of biomass required (> 5 wt %) is expected to be detrimental for coke strength...|$|R
