5|$|The 16th-century Spanish conquistadors {{were armed}} with one- and two-handed broadswords, lances, pikes, rapiers, halberds, <b>crossbows,</b> matchlocks and light artillery. <b>Crossbows</b> were easier to {{maintain}} than matchlocks, {{especially in the}} humid tropical climate of the Caribbean region that included much of the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|After King John's death, however, St Briavels Castle {{became the}} primary centre for English quarrel manufacture. The {{crossbow}} {{was an important}} military advance on the older short bow and was the favoured weapon {{by the time of}} Richard Imany <b>crossbows</b> and even more quarrels were needed to supply royal forces. <b>Crossbows</b> were primarily built at the Tower of London, but St Briavels Castle, with the local forest to provide raw materials, became the national centre for quarrel manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Castles saw an {{increasing}} use of arrowslits by the 13th century, especially in England, almost certainly linked {{to the introduction of}} <b>crossbows.</b> These arrowslits were combined with firing positions from the tops of the towers, initially protected by wooden hoarding until stone machicolations were introduced in England in the late 13th century. The crossbow was an important military advance on the older short bow and was the favoured weapon by the time of Richard I; many <b>crossbows</b> and vast numbers of quarrels were needed to supply royal forces, in turn requiring larger scale iron production. In England, <b>crossbows</b> were primarily made at the Tower of London but St Briavels Castle, with the local Forest of Dean available to provide raw materials, became the national centre for quarrel manufacture. In Scotland, Edinburgh Castle became the centre for the production of bows, <b>crossbows</b> and siege engines for the king.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the low-velocity shots of the bullet-shooting <b>crossbow,</b> the projectiles were not {{as effective as the}} bolt on the standard <b>crossbow.</b> The sharp bolts of the <b>crossbow</b> did more damage than the slow-moving, blunt bullets of the bullet-shooting <b>crossbow.</b> Because the standard bolt does more damage, the bullet-shooting <b>crossbow</b> was reserved for hunting smaller animals. There was no reason to use a bolt-shooting <b>crossbow</b> to hunt squirrels when a smaller, less-powerful weapon could get the job done just as effectively.|$|R
50|$|The World <b>Crossbow</b> Shooting Association (WCSA) makes {{available}} {{four sets}} of Star Achievement Awards (badges) to encourage both participation in tournaments and to provide recognition for reaching certain scores: TC 900 for outdoor target <b>crossbow,</b> SC 600 for outdoor sport <b>crossbow,</b> Indoor 40 for indoor 40 cm face for both target and sport <b>crossbow,</b> and Indoor 25 for indoor 25 cm face for both target and sport <b>crossbow.</b>|$|R
50|$|Once at {{the heart}} of San Marino's army, the <b>Crossbow</b> Corps is now a {{ceremonial}} force of approximately eighty volunteers. Since 1295, the <b>Crossbow</b> Corps has provided demonstrations of <b>crossbow</b> shooting at festivals. Its uniform is medieval in design. While still a statutory military unit, the <b>Crossbow</b> Corps has no military function today.|$|R
5|$|Port Royal, {{based on}} , {{contains}} the most content edits. Cutscenes were edited to {{remove some of}} the violence, such as William Turner threatening to commit suicide while aiming a gun at his neck, as in the film. Unlike the Japanese version, the undead pirates do not catch fire when affected by Fire magic, and their muskets were modified to resemble <b>crossbows,</b> though the <b>crossbows</b> still fire with an audible musket shot sound effect.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish made {{driftwood}} rafts {{to cross}} the Rio Grande. They lost their <b>crossbows</b> when the unstable rafts tipped.|$|E
5|$|Medieval Europeans favoured self bows as hand bows, {{but they}} made {{composite}} prods for <b>crossbows.</b> The prods were usually well protected from rain and humidity which are prevalent in much of Europe.|$|E
50|$|For {{mid-range}} weapons, the Composite <b>Crossbow</b> {{was tested}} against the Steel <b>Crossbow</b> in eliminating three defenders. The Composite <b>Crossbow</b> scored a 3/9 hit ratio, a 1/6 kill ratio, and an Average Reload time of 20s while the Steel <b>Crossbow</b> scored a 6/9 hit ratio, a 4/6 kill ratio, and an Average Reload time of 57s. Even {{though it was}} very slow to reload, the edge {{was given to the}} Steel <b>Crossbow</b> for its better accuracy and longer range.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} 1943 {{code name}} Bodyline {{was replaced with}} <b>Crossbow</b> on November 15, 1943. Post-war, <b>Crossbow</b> operations became known as Operation <b>Crossbow</b> as early as 1962, particularly following the 1965 film of the same name.|$|R
50|$|The <b>crossbow</b> {{has been}} around since the 5th century BC. China was the first to create the {{hand-held}} <b>crossbow.</b> The ammunition of choice was the bolt and was often made of bronze. It was used effectively as a weapon both in battle and for hunting. As powerful a weapon as the <b>crossbow</b> was, it didn’t have the capability of hunting smaller animals like birds, squirrels, and rabbits. As a weapon, the bolt <b>crossbow</b> was much more popular and therefore more widely developed than the bullet-shooting <b>crossbow.</b> Consequently, the standard <b>crossbow</b> was more frequently updated with new ammunition, attachments, and other improvements, leaving the bullet-shooting <b>crossbow</b> in the past. However, in discussing astronomical topics such as solar and lunar eclipses, the Western-Han era Chinese mathematician and music theorist Jing Fang (78-37 BC) wrote that the moon, shaped like a ball, produced no light and was illuminated only by the sun, which he compared to the shape of a round <b>crossbow</b> bullet.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{developments}} in the military sphere during the Late Middle Ages was {{the increased use of}} infantry and light cavalry. The English also employed longbowmen, but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success. Armour continued to advance, spurred by the increasing power of <b>crossbows,</b> and plate armour was developed to protect soldiers from <b>crossbows</b> as well as the hand-held guns that were developed. Pole arms reached new prominence with the development of the Flemish and Swiss infantry armed with pikes and other long spears.|$|E
5|$|Baha al-Din also {{described}} {{the difference in}} power between the Crusader crossbow and the bows of his own army. He saw Frankish infantrymen with from one to ten arrows sticking from their armoured backs marching along with no apparent hurt, whilst the <b>crossbows</b> struck down both horse and man amongst the Muslims.|$|E
5|$|Crossbow and repeating crossbow: According to British art {{historian}} Matthew Landruss and Gerald Hurley, Chinese <b>crossbows</b> {{may have been}} invented {{as far back as}} 2000 BC, while Anne McCants speculates that they existed around 1200 BC. In China bronze crossbow bolts dating as early as the mid 5th century BC were found at a State of Chu burial site in Yutaishan, Hubei. The earliest handheld crossbow stocks with bronze trigger, dating from the 6th century BC, comes from Tomb 3 and 12 found at Qufu, Shandong, capital of the State of Lu. Other early finds of <b>crossbows</b> were discovered in Tomb 138 at Saobatang, Hunan dated to the mid 4th century BC. Repeating <b>crossbows,</b> first mentioned in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, were discovered in 1986 in Tomb 47 at Qinjiazui, Hubei dated to around the 4th century BC. The earliest textual evidence of the handheld crossbow used in battle dates to the 4th century BC. Handheld <b>crossbows</b> with complex bronze trigger mechanisms have also been found with the Terracotta Army in the tomb of Qin Shihuang (r. 221–210 BC) that are similar to specimens from the subsequent Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), while crossbowmen described in the Han Dynasty learned drill formations, some were even mounted as cavalry units, and Han dynasty writers attributed the success of numerous battles against the Xiongnu to massed crossbow fire. In comparison, the ancient Greeks also had a crossbow known as the gastraphetes ("belly-bow", so named because the shooter had to draw the bow by pressing his stomach against the concave rear) also invented in the 5th century BC; other versions were the more portable Cheirobalista (hand balista), arcubalista and manubalista, this last Roman version was almost all metal composed (the spring mechanism and the skeins). There was also the katapeltikon (399 BC), a siege weapon using similar mechanisms. Unlike the Chinese crossbow, the heavy weight and bulk of these weapons necessitated a prop to keep them standing.|$|E

50|$|For {{long-range}} weapons, the repeating <b>crossbow</b> {{was tested}} against the steel <b>crossbow.</b> The repeating <b>crossbow</b> fired 20 {{shots in the}} span of 30 seconds, and was shown capable of penetrating the chain part of Vlad's plated chainmail although it was a glancing wound. In all, the cross bow delivered seven hits. However the steel <b>crossbow</b> could only get off two shots and delivered only one kill with the second bolt bouncing off Sun Tzu's leather armor. The edge was given to the repeating <b>crossbow</b> for its superior rate of fire.|$|R
5|$|In Eastern Han—possibly {{due to the}} Coachman's {{influence}} over the transport of arms—a prefect in charge of manufacturing bows, <b>crossbows,</b> swords, and armor for the military was transferred from the Minister Steward's ministry {{to that of the}} Minister Coachman.|$|E
5|$|In {{military}} affairs, {{the use of}} infantry with specialised roles increased. Along {{with the}} still-dominant heavy cavalry, armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen, as well as sappers and engineers. <b>Crossbows,</b> which had been known in Late Antiquity, increased in use {{partly because of the}} increase in siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries. The increasing use of <b>crossbows</b> during the 12th and 13th centuries led to the use of closed-face helmets, heavy body armour, as well as horse armour. Gunpowder was known in Europe by the mid-13th century with a recorded use in European warfare by the English against the Scots in 1304, although it was merely used as an explosive and not as a weapon. Cannon were being used for sieges in the 1320s, and hand-held guns were in use by the 1360s.|$|E
5|$|Uses {{for regular}} glass fiber include mats and fabrics for thermal insulation, {{electrical}} insulation, sound insulation, high-strength fabrics or heat- and corrosion-resistant fabrics. It {{is also used}} to reinforce various materials, such as tent poles, pole vault poles, arrows, bows and <b>crossbows,</b> translucent roofing panels, automobile bodies, hockey sticks, surfboards, boat hulls, and paper honeycomb. It has been used for medical purposes in casts. Glass fiber is extensively used for making FRP tanks and vessels.|$|E
50|$|Section 1 of the Act made it {{an offence}} to knowingly sell or hire a <b>crossbow</b> (or part of a <b>crossbow)</b> to a person {{under the age of}} seventeen; section 2 created the {{converse}} offence of buying or hiring a <b>crossbow</b> whilst underage.|$|R

50|$|The ancient Chinese <b>crossbow</b> often {{included}} a metal (i.e. bronze or steel) grid serving as iron sights. Modern <b>crossbow</b> sights often use similar technology to modern firearm sights, such as red dot sights and telescopic sights. Many <b>crossbow</b> scopes feature multiple crosshairs {{to compensate for}} the significant effects of gravity over different ranges. In most cases, a newly bought <b>crossbow</b> will need to be sighted for accurate shooting.|$|R
5|$|Ballistas or springalds were siege {{engines that}} {{worked on the}} same {{principles}} as <b>crossbows.</b> With their origins in Ancient Greece, tension was used to project a bolt or javelin. Missiles fired from these engines had a lower trajectory than trebuchets or mangonels and were more accurate. They were more commonly used against the garrison rather than the buildings of a castle. Eventually cannons developed {{to the point where}} they were more powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the main weapon in siege warfare.|$|E
5|$|Composite bows {{can be used}} without {{difficulty}} by infantry. The infantry archers of classical Greece and the Roman Empire used composite bows. The military of the Han Dynasty (220 BCE–206 CE) utilized composite <b>crossbows,</b> often in infantry square formations, in their many engagements against the Xiongnu. Until 1571 archers with composite bows were a main component of {{the forces of the}} Ottoman Empire, but in the Battle of Lepanto in that year they lost most of these troops and never replaced them.|$|E
5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy {{and how long it}} takes to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, <b>crossbows</b> and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|E
50|$|The weapon used by {{the ancient}} militaries was {{developed}} into a composite-recurve variety for more power. The recurved repeating <b>crossbow</b> is generally still weaker than the regular recurved <b>crossbow,</b> and was mainly used for sieges or behind shield cover. The Chinese repeating <b>crossbow</b> had a maximum range of 120 meters, with an effective range of 80 m. Non-recurved versions of the repeating <b>crossbow</b> were often used for home defense.|$|R

50|$|The word {{applies to}} both <b>crossbow</b> and arbalest (the latter may be {{referred}} to as a heavy <b>crossbow,</b> but an actual heavy <b>crossbow</b> may not be the same as an arbalest). In some cases, the word has been used to refer to arbalists, the people who actually used the weapon.|$|R
5|$|Spanish {{weaponry}} {{and tactics}} differed greatly {{from that of}} the indigenous peoples. This included the Spanish use of <b>crossbows,</b> firearms (including muskets, arquebuses and cannon), war dogs and war horses. Horses had never been encountered by the Maya before, and their use gave the mounted conquistador an overwhelming advantage over his unmounted opponent, allowing the rider to strike with greater force while simultaneously making him less vulnerable to attack. The mounted conquistador was highly manoeuvrable and this allowed groups of combatants to quickly displace themselves across the battlefield. The horse itself was not passive, and could buffet the enemy combatant.|$|E
5|$|The D-shaped towers {{along the}} curtain wall {{are similar to}} those of several other Saxon Shore forts, {{although}} their placement is somewhat unusual. Because the fort was partly surrounded by marshes and water, which provided natural defences, the Romans economised by only building towers on the more vulnerable north-eastern and far western sectors. The towers were probably used to mount artillery weapons such as catapults and heavy <b>crossbows.</b> Ten towers still survive, though there may originally have been more before the loss of the south wall.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish conquistadores {{were largely}} volunteers, {{receiving}} {{the spoils of}} victory instead of a salary; many were experienced soldiers who had already campaigned in Europe. The Spanish expeditions to Central America were launched from three different Spanish jurisdictions, resulting in rival conquests by mutually hostile Spanish captains. Spanish weaponry included swords, firearms, <b>crossbows</b> and light artillery. Metal armour was impractical in the hot, humid climate of Central America and the Spanish were quick to adopt the quilted cotton armour of the natives. The conquistadors were supported by {{a large number of}} Indian auxiliaries drawn from previously encountered Mesoamerican groups.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crossbow</b> was {{the first}} arcade game with fully {{digitized}} sound and speech (some earlier games such as Journey used a loop tape for music and speech effects). It also featured {{some of the most}} advanced graphics of the time. <b>Crossbow</b> featured an optical light gun. The game's light gun resembled a full-sized <b>crossbow.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>crossbow</b> {{is a type}} {{of weapon}} based on the bow and {{consisting}} of a horizontal bow-like assembly mounted on a stock. It shoots projectiles called bolts or quarrels. The medieval <b>crossbow</b> was called by many names, most of which were derived from the word ballista, a torsion siege engine resembling a <b>crossbow.</b>|$|R
50|$|Section 3 made it {{an offence}} for someone {{under the age of}} {{seventeen}} to possess a functioning <b>crossbow,</b> or of sufficient parts to make a functioning <b>crossbow,</b> unless under the supervision of an adult. Section 4 gave a police constable the power to search someone or their vehicle, if they suspected an offence was being committed under section 3; to detain someone {{for the purpose of this}} search; and to confiscate any <b>crossbow</b> or part of a <b>crossbow</b> which was found.|$|R
