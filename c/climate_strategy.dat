In the development and climate programme, the starting point is not climate but instead development priorities. The idea is that objectives of development and poverty eradication must be met but with strategies that aim for climate friendly and climate safe development. The workshop on Financing Integrated Development & <b>Climate</b> <b>strategies</b> explored this development-first approach by looking into the possibilities of attracting investments, which are required to make a proper transition towards a sustainable development pathway. The workshop identified five approaches to improve financing of integrated development and <b>climate</b> <b>strategies,</b> which can be used by policy makers and the private sector...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{financial}} sector on climate change remains largely under-estimated. Banks can steer investments of their customers in low-emission technologies and adjust the conditions of loans that they provide to green-house gas intensive sectors. However, the authors ’ research shows that few banks take such substantive action when they implement their <b>climate</b> <b>strategy.</b> The authors analyze 114 listed banks {{around the world and}} find evidence for deflective decoupling. This evidence means that banks that implement a <b>climate</b> <b>strategy</b> often decouple it from their main value creat-ing processes such as lending and investment. Those banks that engage in more substantive action still combine it with symbolic activities which may facilitate the strategic change process. This study contributes to the litera-ture on organizations and the natural environment as the authors specify which kind of banks implement substantive climate strategies. This research holds important implications for policy makers and managers who aim to implement a <b>climate</b> <b>strategy</b> in organizations that create value through information and financial flows but not with a physical transfer of goods. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 11, 2016 bas. sagepub. comDownloaded from Furrer et al. 6...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} global climate change is {{increasingly}} impacting on the power sector in Europe. This in-depth company case study examines how the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) has affected the Norwegian power company Statkraft – Europe’s largest producer of renewable energy. The study assesses whether and how Statkraft’s <b>climate</b> <b>strategy</b> changed in the period 2003 – 2009, evaluated on a continuum from ‘defensive’ to ‘indifferent’, ‘offensive’ and ‘innovative’ climate strategies; and how the EU ETS has influenced these changes. Statkraft’s <b>climate</b> <b>strategy</b> emerges as increasingly ‘offensive’, due not least to the company’s long-term plans for expansion in flexible and renewable energy sources. The reasons for not classifying Statkraft’s <b>climate</b> <b>strategy</b> as ‘innovative’ relate to the company’s focus on old renewables and the limited emphasis on innovation in new climate-friendly technologies. The explanatory framework builds on the multi-level governance approach, examining how factors from the EU, national and company levels influence climate strategies through mechanisms of risks and opportunities. The literature to date has focused on how external factors influence corporate climate strategies. This thesis finds that expectations of a more stringent and predictable EU ETS, together with perceptions of complementary EU climate goals and other policies, have provided Statkraft with a solid strategic framework for an offensive <b>climate</b> <b>strategy.</b> However, the ownership and renewables policies of the Norwegian authorities have had a restraining effect, making it harder for Statkraft to adopt an innovative strategy in the short or long term. To fully explain changes in Statkraft’s <b>climate</b> <b>strategy,</b> the study utilizes a third perspective: examining factors in the company itself. Statkraft’s corporate identity, shaped before the introduction of the EU ETS, relies heavily on technological specialization, well-established renewables and the role as Europe’s peak supplier. Despite some internal attempts to change this identity by focusing on innovation, new market opportunities and portfolio diversification, efforts have been too few and random for Statkraft to be termed ‘innovative’ in the sense applied in this thesis. The major analytical implication {{of this study is that}} accurately understanding changes in corporate climate strategies requires drawing on explanatory factors from different levels –company-specific factors in particular. Further in-depth company studies are essential for fully understanding the effects of climate change regulations...|$|E

40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} from a survey of national legislation and <b>strategies</b> to mitigate <b>climate</b> change covering almost all United Nations member states between 2007 and 2012. This data set is distinguished from the existing literature in its breadth of coverage, its focus on national policies (rather than international pledges), and {{on the use of}} objective metrics rather than normative criteria. The focus of the data is limited to national <b>climate</b> legislation and <b>strategies</b> and does not cover subnational or sectoral measures. <b>Climate</b> legislation and <b>strategies</b> are important because they can: enhance incentives for climate mitigation; provide mechanisms for mainstreaming; and provide a focal point for actors. Three broad findings emerge. First, there has been a substantial increase in <b>climate</b> legislation and <b>strategies</b> between 2007 and 2012 : 67 % of global GHG emissions are now under national <b>climate</b> legislation or <b>strategy</b> compared to 45 % in 2007. Second, there are substantial regional effects to the patterns, with most increases in non-Annex I countries, particularly in Asia and Latin America. Third, many more countries have adopted <b>climate</b> <b>strategies</b> than have adopted climate legislation between 2007 and 2012. The article concludes with recommendations for future research. Policy relevance The increase in <b>climate</b> legislation and <b>strategy</b> is significant. This spread suggests that, at the national level, there is some movement in reshaping climate governance despite the relatively slow pace of global negotiations, although the exact implications of this spread require further research on stringency of actions and their implementation. Asia and Latin America represent the biggest improvements, while OECD countries, which start from a high base, remain relatively stagnant. Implications of regional patterns are further refined by an analysis by emissions, which shows that some areas of low levels of legislation and strategy are also areas of relatively low emissions. A broad trend toward an emphasis on strategies rather than legislation, with the significant exception of China, calls for enhanced research into the practical impact of national non-binding <b>climate</b> <b>strategies</b> versus binding legislation on countries' actual emissions over time.
