And it's not just because I went 3-for-4, or had a great game. It's just the fact that I represent a lot of Jewish people {{and a lot of the}} Jewish heritage, and the struggles that a lot of our people have had.|$|E
5|$|Beginning to play {{organized}} hockey {{at the age}} of four, Hamhuis was {{competing against}} other players as old as eight years, as his hometown was not big enough to fill teams for younger age groups. He went to provincials four seasons in a row and won the title with his club, the Smithers Storm, in overtime during his last year of minor hockey. Future Predators teammate Cody Franson was a stick boy for Hamhuis' team, while another Nashville blueliner, Shea Weber, did the same for a competing team at provincial tournaments. Hamhuis grew up <b>cheering</b> <b>for</b> the Edmonton Oilers and Vancouver Canucks.|$|E

5|$|The heavy {{sentence}} aroused strong {{reactions in}} Italy {{and in the}} United States. In Palermo {{a group of students}} went to the Teatro Bellini and asked the orchestra to perform the hymn of Garibaldi. And the theatre applauded. In March 1896, after Crispi had to resign due to the humiliating defeat of the Italian army at Battle of Adwa in Ethiopia during First Italo-Ethiopian War, the new government under Prime minister Antonio Di Rudinì recognized the excessive brutality of the repression. Many Fasci members were pardoned and released from jail. Di Rudinì made it clear though that a reorganization of the Fasci would not be tolerated. After their release, De Felice, Barbato and Bosco were met by a large crowd of supporters in Rome, who released the horses form their carriage and dragged them to the hotel, <b>cheering</b> <b>for</b> socialism and denouncing Crispi.|$|E
5|$|While Smith was {{attending}} junior high school, his parents divorced. Continuing {{to pursue his}} interest in baseball, he would ride the bus {{for nearly an hour}} to reach Dodger Stadium, <b>cheering</b> <b>for</b> the Los Angeles Dodgers at about 25 games a year. Upon becoming a student at Locke High School, Smith played on the basketball and baseball teams. Smith was a teammate of future National Basketball Association player Marques Johnson on the basketball team, and a teammate of future fellow Hall-of-Fame player Eddie Murray on the baseball side. After high school Smith attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1974 on a partial academic scholarship, and managed to walk-on to the baseball team. In addition to his academic education, he learned to switch-hit from Cal Poly coach Berdy Harr. When Cal Poly's starting shortstop broke his leg midway through the 1974 season, Smith subsequently took over the starting role. Later named an All-American athlete, he established school records in career at bats (754) and career stolen bases (110) before graduating in 1977.|$|E

25|$|After {{nearly two}} years, on March 16, 1896, he was {{released}} {{as the result of}} a pardon recognizing the excessive brutality of the repression. After his release, Barbato and the other Fasci leaders Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida and Rosario Garibaldi Bosco were met by a large crowd of supporters in Rome, who released the horses form their carriage and dragged them to the hotel, <b>cheering</b> <b>for</b> socialism and denouncing Crispi. When Barbato returned to his home town Piana dei Greci, he was greeted by 5,000 people, more than half the population. At that point he was probably the most popular socialist leader in Sicily.|$|E

25|$|On May 30, 1894, he {{was sentenced}} to 18 years of prison at a trial in Palermo against the leaders of the Fasci.

Captain Blue is restored to normal and reveals that Jet was his best friend and cinematographer, but had found the Black Film one day and became entranced by its power {{and that of the}} Rainbow Oscars. In the end, it is revealed that all Jet really wanted was to prove himself as a hero to his own son Joe.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the effort}} from WWE {{to promote the}} Brock Lesnar versus Goldberg contest, some critics {{expressed}} disappointment with the match, with many in Madison Square Garden booing both competitors and only <b>cheering</b> <b>for</b> Steve Austin {{because of the fact}} that both participants were set to leave the WWE after the event with Goldberg not signing a new contract and Lesnar going to work in the NFL. Goldberg returned to WWE in 2016 and reignited his rivalry with Lesnar, after the pair had been feuding for several months through social media and during promotional work for the WWE 2K17 video game, which featured Lesnar as the cover star and Goldberg as the pre-order bonus. This would set up a rematch between the two at the 2016 Survivor Series, where Goldberg defeated Lesnar after two consecutive spears and a Jackhammer in 1 minute and 26 seconds. A final match between them occurred at WrestleMania 33 in April 2017, where Lesnar defeated Goldberg in a match for the Universal Championship to end the feud.|$|E

25|$|A {{few weeks}} after the start of the pre-season, yet {{prior to the start of}} the {{competitive}} season, the club opens its doors for free for all Feyenoord fans to have fun together and to present the squad for the upcoming season. De Kuip already opens in the morning when there are many activities around the stadium mainly for kids and promotional activities for companies which have a partnership with Feyenoord. Fans can also take a stadium tour and walk on the pitch. The activities inside the stadium itself normally start around noon, when there are several performances by various artists. Every year, the new Feyenoord ambassador of the year is announced at opening day. A minute of silence is held for all former Feyenoord players who have died and for known fans who have died in the previous year. Former Feyenoord players return to De Kuip every year to play versus a team of Dutch celebrities. The stadium activities end after the squad for the upcoming season is presented to the fans. This is always a special happening, mainly for the new signings of the team. They will be flown into the stadium with helicopters when a full stadium is <b>cheering</b> <b>for</b> them when they arrive. Once they are there, the other players and club officials enter the pitch one by one. Last but not least, all players are available for autograph sessions afterwards. Feyenoord's open day attracts approximately 60,000 to 70,000 fans towards Rotterdam, coming from all over the Netherlands, while there are only 51,117 seats available within the stadium. The opening day is known as a unique event in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|The Dos Leyendas show {{featured}} a new entrance {{set up by}} CMLL, featuring three large video screens and separate staircases for the rudos and tecnicos to come down during their introductions. The crowd {{was estimated to be}} over 14,000 spectators in total, which was a significant improvement compared to the attendance of the Super Viernes shows of the previous weeks, which had drawn less than half those numbers. In the opening match La Dinastía Casas ("The Casas Dynasty") of El Felino and his sons Puma and Tiger shows their team unity with their black and white ring gear as well as Puma and Tiger both wearing masks that combined their own mask design with that of their brother. While the team of Delta, Guerrero Maya Jr. and Tritón came ready to fight El Felino was fired up and motivated by teaming with his sons, which showed in his performance in the match. Puma and Tiger had been at odds at times before the show, but there was no signs of dissension during the match as La Dinastía Casas won both the second and third fall, taking the final fall with Tiger and Puma pinning their opponents. The second match clearly demonstrated that Los Hijos del Averno (Averno, Mephisto and Ephesto) work as a well functioning team due to their many years of experience from teaming together, the three managed to win the first fall over La Máscara, Máscara Dorada and Valiente in convincing fashion, {{so much so that the}} Arena Mexico crowd were <b>cheering</b> <b>for</b> the team despite them being the rudos in the match. During the second fall the high flying moves and skills of Máscara Dorada was the only time the crowd would cheer for the tecnico side, supporting them as they won the second fall. In the third and deciding fall Averno got the pinfall victory for his team, giving Los Hijos del Averno a very appreciated victory.|$|E
