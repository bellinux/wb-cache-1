40|$|Cross flow heat {{exchangers}} made from aluminum are common as radiators in vehicles. However, {{due to the}} increasing power requirement and the limited available space in vehicles, {{it is extremely difficult}} to increase the size of {{heat exchangers}} (HEXs) placed in the front of vehicles. Placing the heat exchanger on the roof or at the underbody of vehicles might offer opportunity to increase the size of the heat exchangers. A new configuration of heat exchangers has to be developed to accommodate the position change. In this study, a countercurrent heat exchanger is proposed for the position {{on the roof of the}} vehicle compartment. Furthermore, a new material, graphite foam having high thermal conductivity (1700 W/(m•K)) and low density (0. 2 to 0. 6 g/cm 3), is introduced as a potential material for those heat exchangers in vehicles. In order to find an appropriate configuration of fins with high thermal performance and low pressure loss on the air side for a countercurrent flow HEX, the main-flow enhancement and the secondary-flow enhancement methods are employed to analyze different configurations of fins. The main-flow enhancement cases included are (1) aluminum: louver-, wavy-, and pin fin; (2) graphite foam: corrugated-, wavy corrugated-, pin-finned-, and baffle fin. The secondary-flow enhancement cases included are graphite foam: rectangular fin, rectangular fin with one-side dimples, and rectangular fin with two-side dimples. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach is applied for the comparative studies by using the ANSYS FLUENT software. Moreover, the simulation results are verified by experimental results from literature. After comparing the performance among different configurations of fin, it is found that the aluminum louver fin shows better performance than the wavy fin and pin fin. Also the graphite foam wavy <b>corrugated</b> <b>fin</b> presents higher heat transfer performance and lower pressure drop than the corrugated-, pin-finned-, and baffle fin. On the other hand, the graphite foam rectangular fin with two-side dimples exhibits better performance than the fin with one-side dimples. The cross flow HEX (made from aluminum) is compared with countercurrent flow HEXs (made from aluminum or graphite foam), in terms of the coefficient of performance (COP), power density (PD), compactness factor (CF), and energy saving efficiency. Due to the high power density and high compactness factor in the countercurrent flow HEXs, the overall size and weight of the countercurrent flow HEXs are much lower than those of the cross flow HEX. Moreover, the graphite foam wavy <b>corrugated</b> <b>fin</b> provides higher power density and higher compactness factor than an aluminum louver fin because of the high thermal conductivity and low density of the graphite foam. Furthermore, a graphite foam fin with two-side dimples exhibits higher coefficient of performance than an aluminum louver fin, and it becomes very efficient in energy saving. However, due to the high pressure loss in the graphite foam wavy <b>corrugated</b> <b>fin,</b> the air pumping power for the countercurrent flow graphite foam wavy <b>corrugated</b> <b>fin</b> HEX is much higher than that of the cross flow aluminum louver fin HEX. Based on the presented studies, useful recommendations are highlighted to promote the development of countercurrent flow HEXs and the graphite foam HEXs in vehicles...|$|E

40|$|The {{flow field}} inside the heat {{exchangers}} {{is associated with}} maximum heat transfer, minimum pressure drop and smallest pumping power. During the recent decades, the developments {{in the application of}} longitudinal vortex generators as an effective technique and important research topic have increased the heat transfer enhancement in the design of compact heat exchangers. The main motivation of this research is to study thermal–hydraulic performance characteristics in a tube bank compact heat exchanger with introducing new design of fins and tube by using computational fluid dynamics approach. One-corrugated and three-corrugated fins with oval tubes are innovative design of the FTCHE (fin-and-tube compact heat exchanger) that promises a large leap in the development of minimized FTCHEs with increased thermal efficiency. The major advantage of such design is its ability to produce substantially increased thermal efficiency and performance criteria of FTCHE. The investigation of thermal–hydraulic performance criteria is conducted for Reynolds number in the range of 200 – 900. This study shows that the flow distinction between plain and corrugated fins has a profound influence on the thermal-hydrodynamic performance. The results reveal that the corrugated fins can considerably advance the thermal efficiency of the FTCHE with a moderate pressure loss penalty. The computational results indicate that the average Nusselt number for the FTCHE with <b>corrugated</b> <b>fin</b> can be increased up to 20. 0 % over the baseline case and the corresponding pressure difference decreased up to 19. 0 %. In addition, the results show that the average value of performance in one-corrugated and three-corrugated fins and oval tube compact heat exchangers up to 5 % and 15 % over the baseline case, respectively. The newly designed fin with oval tube shows potential improvement of heat transfer performance and moderate pressure loss in the FTCHE compared with the baseline case...|$|E

40|$|The {{last few}} years have seen a rapid {{growth in the number}} of cars {{equipped}} with airconditioning systems. The space available to fit the system is limited and the under bonnet environment is hostile. Moreover, the depletion of the stratospheric ozone has led to legislation on the phasing out of the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). These substances are used as refrigerants in most refrigeration, heat pump and air-conditioning systems in service today. The aim of this research project was to study existing air-conditioning systems used in automotive applications to develop a model that simulates the components of these systems. This provides a better understanding of the effect of using different refrigerants in the system and its performance. Experimental studies of the performance of the different heat exchanger geometries used provided inputs to the model developed. Automotive air-conditioning condensers and evaporators simulation models were developed and used to compare the performance of these heat exchangers using CFC and HCFC refrigerants and the non-ozone depleting replacements. Thermodynamic properties of the new refrigerants were derived from the equation of state. The evaporator was simulated taking into consideration the mass transfe r associated with the heat transfer in humid conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{need for}} more {{efficient}} air conditioning systems requires an in depth understanding about the performance of its components. One of the key components in the air conditioning plant is the fin-and-tube cooling coil, which is investigated here. The main focus {{of the work is}} concerned with the analysis of fin-and-tube cooling coils having two classes of passive enhancement techniques known as corrugated and turbulated fins with particular reference of developing flow region. Initially, two-dimensional modelling was done to establish the scope of later three-dimensional modelling in terms of dominant variables, meshing strategies and convergence criteria. The results gave key insights into required modelling strategies needed for the more complex three-dimensional problem of the composite fin-and-tube cooling coil. Three-dimensional CFD modelling of fin-and-tube cooling coils having turbulated, corrugated and flat-fin geometries have been investigated with particular reference to the dry-hot arid climate. Five modelling approaches have been considered based on an isothermal fin-and-tube, periodic boundaries, conjugate heat transfer, tube-row temperature gradient and the effect of manufacturing defects. The last three approaches are novel contributions to this field of research. The influences of the key design parameters of fin pitch, fin material, and fin thickness have also been investigated parametrically for all fin types. To provide confidence in these models, experimental studies on these cooling coils were carried out to acquire data for comparison between the predicted and measured values of heat transfer and friction, and to investigate the effect of range of design conditions on the cooling coils performance. The detailed results of this work can be used to optimise the air-conditioning coil designs. The turbulated fin coil was found to give the highest values of Nusselt number at given friction factor followed by the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fin</b> coil. At a given pressure drop (dP = 52 N/m 2 corresponding to 14, = 2. 3 m/s), the heat transfer coefficient of the corrugated and turbulated fin coils was higher than that of flat fin by 16 % and 36 % respectively. For typical operating conditions, the corrugated and turbulated fin coils required core volumes of 19 % and 40 % less than that of flat fin coil respectively for the same performance. The cooling coils employing corrugated and turbulated fin geometries contribute significantly to the energy conservation and volume reduction of the air conditioning plant...|$|E
40|$|Most {{empirical}} {{correlations for}} determining the fin-side heat and mass-transfer coefficients are applicable to cooling and dehumidifying coils with flat-plate fins only. There are very few heat-transfer data for corrugated-plate fins in the open literature. Among those available, the most comprehensive set of experimental data was that contributed by Beecher and Pagan. On that basis, they, and later Webb, derived heat-transfer correlations for both <b>corrugated</b> and flat <b>fin</b> surfaces. However, these correlations are inadequate for modelling cooling and dehumidifying coils because Beecher and Pagan's data are restricted to dry fins and to a limited range of coil configurations. The paper describes a steady-state model for chilled-water cooling and dehumidifying coils with corrugated-plate fins. This model was developed {{on the basis of}} McQuiston's correlations for flat-plate fins but included the use of Webb's correlations to determine a correction factor to make the flat-fin coefficients applicable to coils with <b>corrugated</b> <b>fins.</b> Comparison of the model predictions with manufacturers' data showed that acceptable predictions of sensible and latent heat-transfer rates can be obtained by applying the correction to the sensible heat-transfer coefficient only.

40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} used in cryogenic applications need to {{have very}} high effectiveness to preserve the refrigerating effect produced. Normally the heat exchangers used in cryogenic refrigerators and liquefiers have effectiveness {{of the order of}} 0. 95 or higher. If the effectiveness of the heat exchangers falls below the design value, there may not be any liquid yield. Plate fin heat exchangers, because of their compactness, low weight and high effectiveness, are widely used in aerospace and cryogenic applications. Such heat exchangers have closely spaced fins and offer narrow and intricate passages for the fluid flow which often leads to significant pressure drop. The stringent requirement of high effectiveness in cryogenic refrigerators and liquefiers and high pressure drop occurring in plate fin heat exchangers make it necessary to test the heat exchanger before putting into operation in a liquefier. Plate fin heat exchanger (PFHE) is a type of compact exchanger that consists of a stack of alternate flat plates called parting sheets and <b>corrugated</b> <b>fins,</b> both being brazed together as a block. Streams exchange heat by flowing along the passages made by the fins between the parting sheets.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the heat transfer characteristics of plate-fin radiator for the cold air heating system of a PEMFC engine and to find the optimal parameter combination in order to reduce the power consumption. The effect of the coolant mass flow and temperature on the heat exchange performance of the radiator was investigated based on 3 D porous medium model. The results, including the amount of heat transferred and temperature change and heat exchanger effectivity with the increasing of the air flow rate at different coolant flow rate were obtained using CFD method. Good agreement is found by comparing the simulation values with the test data and the deviation is less than 7 % which indicate simulation model validation and research method feasibility used in this study. The simulation results indicate that bigger coolant flow rate and temperature result in higher outlet air temperature and the amount of heat transferred. The variation of the heat exchanger effectivity is predicted for different working conditions. Based on the Taguchi method, the influence of structural parameters of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fins</b> on the heat transfer and pressure drop of the radiator is analyzed qualitatively.

The exchange of heat occurs by the streams through the fins. Generally, aluminium is used for manufacturing PFHE due to their high thermal conductivity & low cost.

Appropriate headers are welded to provide the necessary interface with the inlet and the exit streams. While aluminum is the most commonly used material, stainless steel construction is employed in high pressure and high temperature applications. The performance of a plate fin heat exchanger is determined, among other things, by the geometry of the fins. The most common fin configurations are - (1) plain (straight and uninterrupted) rectangular or trapezoidal fins (2) uninterrupted wavy fins and (3) interrupted fins such as offset strip, louver and perforated fins. The interrupted surfaces provide greater heat transfer at the cost of higher flow impedance. Here I have designed rectangular offset plate fin heat exchanger. I have assumed some data and based on them I have designed heat exchanger. The flowing fluid in heat exchanger is liquid nitrogen and material of heat exchanger is Al. After designing the heat exchanger, rating is also necessary. The heat transfer and flow friction characteristics of plate fin surfaces are presented in terms of the Colburn factor j and the Fanning friction factor f vs. Reynolds number Re, the relationships being different for different surfaces. The laminar flow model under predicts j and f values at high Reynolds number, while the 2 -Layer k-e turbulence model over predicts the data throughout the range of interest. Because most industrial heat exchangers operate with Re less than 3000, and because the j and f data predicted by the laminar and the 2 -layer k-e turbulence model differ little from each other at low Reynolds numbers, we have used the laminar flow model up to Reynolds number of 10, 000, which is considered to be the limit for plate fin heat exchangers operating with gases.

40|$|Louvered fin heat {{exchangers}} {{have been used}} extensively in automotive and air-conditioning applications. It provides additional heat transfer surface while maintaining low pressure drop compared to typical <b>corrugated</b> <b>fins.</b> The geometry of these fins is seen to be critical in determining the performance of {{heat exchangers}}. This project reports the effects of geometrical parameters on the pressure drop and heat transfer characteristics of louvered fin heat exchangers. Investigation was conducted using both experimental and simulations work. Experimental work was implemented to visualize the flow characteristics at different Reynolds number. The experiment involved the fabrication and testing of 10 : 1 scaled up model of multiple louvered fins installed inside a test section. Simulations were also conducted using commercial CFD code, ANSYS Fluent. Two types of domain were modeled using single and multiple stacking. In this simulation, three identified variables are louver angle, louvered pitch and fin pitch with different Reynolds number from 200 to 1000. The heat exchanger performance was analyzed in terms of pressure drop and heat transfer to determine the suitable parameters of louvered fins. Two types of Reynolds number were also used including Reynolds number based on louver pitch (ReLP) and fin pitch (ReFP). The results obtained from the experiment show that significant changes of flow direction occur as the Reynolds number increases from 200 to 1000. The changes occur from duct directed flow (low Reynolds number) to louver directed flow (high Reynolds number). In simulation work, the fin pitch and louver pitch shows a considerable effect on the pressure drop as well as heat transfer rate. It is observed that the increasing fin pitch will result in an increase of heat transfer rate and lower pressure drop. On the other hand, low pressure drop and low heat transfer rate are obtained when the louver pitch is increased. Overall results show that configuration 5 (LP = 0. 7 mm and FP = 3. 25 mm) at louver angle 25. 5 o possess highest heat transfer coefficient and lowest pressure drop.

An experimental study of the heat transfers and pressure drop of compact heat exchangers with louvered fins and flat tubes was conducted within a low air-side Reynolds number range of 20 3 ̆c ReLp 3 ̆c 225. Using an existing low-speed wind tunnel, 26 sample heat exchangers of <b>corrugated</b> louver <b>fin</b> type, were tested. New correlations for Colburn j and Fanning friction f factor have been developed in terms of non-dimensional parameters. Within the investigated parameter ranges, it seems that both the j and f factors are better represented by two correlations in two flow regimes (one for ReLp = 20 – 80 and one for ReLp = 80 – 200) than a single regime correlation in the power-law format. The results support the conclusion that airflow and heat transfer at very low Reynolds numbers behaves differently from that at higher Reynolds numbers. The effect of the geometrical parameters on the heat exchanger performance was investigated. The numerical investigation was conducted for further understanding of the flow behavior at the range of experimentally tested Reynolds number. Ten different heat exchanger geometries with varied geometrical parameters obtained for the experimental studies were considered for the numerical investigation. The variations in the louver angle were {{the basis of the}} selection.

The most common fin configurations are - (1) plain (straight and uninterrupted) rectangular or trapezoidal fins (2) uninterrupted wavy fins and (3) interrupted fins such as offset strip, louver and perforated fins. The interrupted surfaces provide greater heat transfer at the cost of higher flow impedance. The heat transfer and flow friction characteristics of plate fin surfaces are presented in terms of the Colburn factor j and the Fanning friction factor f vs. Reynolds number Re, the relationships being different for different surfaces. One of the earliest and the most authoritative sources for j and f data on plate fin surfaces is the monograph Compact Heat Exchangers by Kays and London [1984]. Although nearly two decades have passed after the latest edition, there has not been any significant addition to this database in open literature. Unlike simpler geometries, the thermal performance of plate fin surfaces is not uniquely determined by the hydraulic diameter; other geometric variables such as fin spacing (s), fin height (h), fin thickness (t), offset strip length (l), wave length (Λ), and wave amplitude (a) have significant effect. It will be prohibitively expensive and time consuming to fabricate heat exchanger cores and carry out experiments over reasonable ranges of so many geometric variables. In contrast, it is reasonably easy and cost effective to conduct a parametric study in numerical simulation and derive correlations for use by the heat exchanger designer. But, because numerical solution is based on certain simplifying assumptions, the computed results are, in general, different from experimentally observed values. To alleviate this problem, we have evolved a procedure where some of the constants in the correlations are estimated from numerical simulation, the rest being determined by fitting experimental data We have used the finite volume based CFD software, FLUENT 6. 1 as the numerical tool. Three-dimensional, steady, Navier-Stokes equations and the Energy equation have been solved with appropriate boundary conditions for plain, offset strip and wavy fin surfaces. We have observed that the laminar flow model under predicts j and f values at high Reynolds number, while the 2 -Layer k-e turbulence model over predicts the data throughout the range of interest. Because most industrial heat exchangers operate with Re less than 3000, and because the j and f data predicted by the laminar and the 2 -layer k-e turbulence model differ little from each other at low Reynolds numbers, we have used the laminar flow model up to Reynolds number of 10, 000, which is considered to be the limit for plate fin heat exchangers operating with gases. Velocity, pressure and temperature fields have been computed and j and f factors determined over appropriate range of Reynolds number and geometric dimensions. The j and f data have been expressed in the form: j or f = F (Re, geometry) = A RebF(dimensionless geometric) parameters The function F is also a power law expression in the geometric parameters such as h/s, t/s, λ/s etc. We have determined the indices of F by multiple regression from numerically computed results, and the constants A and b by fitting experimental data of Kays and London. Because the j or f vs. Re curves show significant non-linearity, we have expressed the correlations in terms of two separate equations over the low and the high Re regimes. The transition Reynolds number has also been correlated with dimensionless geometric parameters. We have thus carried out an exhaustive numerical study on the heat transfer and flow friction phenomena in plate fin heat exchanger surfaces with plain, wavy and offset strip fins. While the data for plain and offset-strip fins have been correlated successfully by pure power law expressions, those for wavy fins have demanded more complex relations. The indices of the dimensionless geometrical factors in wavy fin geometry have been expressed as simple polynomials of Reynolds number. A practical approach has evolved for determining the dependence of j and f factors on Re and dimensionless geometrical features. A set of correlations has been generated for use in heat exchanger design. These correlations are expected to extend the range and accuracy of available correlations, particularly for offset strip fin and wavy fin surfaces...|$|R
