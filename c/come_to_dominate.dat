5|$|Creek {{restoration}} projects {{since the}} 1990s {{have reduced the}} amount of Himalayan blackberry, an invasive species that had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>dominate</b> much of the landscape near the creek. New plantings include native shrubs and trees such as red-osier dogwood, elderberry, Indian plum, and willow. City parks adjacent to Johnson Creek have areas devoted to marsh with shrubs, cattails, and smartweed, forested wetland, riparian woodland, open meadow, and orchard trees.|$|E
5|$|The Permian–Triassic {{extinction}} event about 252 {{million years}} ago, {{which was a}} prolonged event due to the accumulation of several extinction pulses, ended the dominance of carnivorous therapsids. In the early Triassic, most medium to large land carnivore niches were taken over by archosaurs which, {{over an extended period}} (35 million years), came to include the crocodylomorphs, the pterosaurs and the dinosaurs; however, large cynodonts like Trucidocynodon and traversodontids still occupied large sized carnivorous and herbivorous niches respectively. By the Jurassic, the dinosaurs had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>dominate</b> the large terrestrial herbivore niches as well.|$|E

5|$|Microsoft is an American public {{multinational}} corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, USA that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports {{a wide range}} of products and services predominantly related to computing through its various product divisions. Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, Microsoft rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. Microsoft would also <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>dominate</b> the office suite market with Microsoft Office. The company has diversified in recent years into the video game industry with the Xbox, the Xbox 360, and the Xbox One, as well as into the consumer electronics and digital services market with Zune, MSN and the Windows Phone OS.|$|E
5|$|The Texas oil boom, {{sometimes}} called the gusher age, {{was a period of}} dramatic change and economic growth in the U.S. state of Texas during the early 20th century that began with the discovery of a large petroleum reserve near Beaumont, Texas. The find was unprecedented in its size and ushered in an age of rapid regional development and industrialization that has few parallels in U.S. history. Texas quickly became one of the leading oil producing states in the U.S., along with Oklahoma and California; soon the nation overtook the Russian Empire as the top producer of petroleum. By 1940 Texas had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>dominate</b> U.S. production. Some historians even define the beginning of the world's Oil Age as the beginning of this era in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Architectural {{evidence}} suggests that, while the Romanesque style peaked {{in much of}} Europe in the later eleventh and early twelfth century, it was still reaching Scotland {{in the second half}} of the twelfth century and was revived in the late fifteenth century, perhaps as a reaction to the English perpendicular style that had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>dominate.</b> Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, a small number of significant crafted items have also survived and, for the end of the period, there is evidence of painting, particularly the extensive commissioning of works in the Low Countries and France.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 10th century, two powers had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>dominate</b> the Balkans: the Byzantine Empire controlled the south of the peninsula and the coasts, and the Bulgarian Empire held the central and northern Balkans. The early decades of the century were dominated by Tsar Simeon(r. 893–927), who expanded his empire at Byzantium's expense in a series of wars and secured for himself recognition of his imperial title. Simeon's death in May 927 was soon followed by a rapprochement between the two powers, formalized with a treaty and a marriage alliance later that same year. Simeon's second son and successor, Peter I(r. 927–969), married Maria, the granddaughter of the Byzantine emperor Romanos I Lekapenos(r. 920–944), and his imperial title was recognized. An annual tribute (which the Byzantines termed a subsidy for Maria's upkeep, to save face) was agreed to be paid to the Bulgarian ruler in exchange for peace.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 12th century the Bigod family had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>dominate</b> Suffolk, holding {{the title of}} the Earl of Norfolk and owning Framlingham and three other major castles at Bungay, Walton and Thetford. The first set of stone buildings, {{including}} the first hall, were built within the castle during the 1160s. Tensions persisted throughout the period, however, between the Crown and the Bigods. Hugh Bigod was {{one of a group of}} dissenting barons during the Anarchy in the reign of King Stephen, and after coming to power Henry II attempted to re-establish royal influence across the region. As part of this effort, Henry confiscated the four Bigod castles from Hugh in 1157, but returned both Framlingham and Bungay in 1165, on payment of a large fine of £666.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth season}} {{concentrates}} on the school system and the mayoral race.

Prez has begun a new career as a mathematics teacher at the same school. The cold-blooded Marlo has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>dominate</b> the streets of the west side, using murder and intimidation to make up for his weak-quality drugs and lack of business acumen. His enforcers Chris Partlow and Snoop conceal their numerous victims in abandoned and boarded-up row houses where the bodies will not be readily discovered. The disappearances of so many known criminals come to mystify both the major crimes unit investigating Marlo and the homicide unit assigned to solve the presumed murders. Marlo coerces Bodie into working under him.|$|E

5|$|Trucks {{were first}} used {{extensively}} {{by the military}} during World War I. With the increase in construction of paved roads, trucking began to achieve a significant foothold in the 1930s. Public safety concerns made it necessary to implement various government regulations (such as the 1965 hours of service rule; recently revised with a compliance date of July 1, 2012) of how long drivers were allowed to work and drive each day/week. In 1956, Taxpayers provided funds to build the Interstate Highway System, an extensive network of highways and freeways that linked major cities across the continent. The addition of Interstate Highway System also {{made it possible for}} the trucking industry to grow substantially in the late 1950s and early 1960s and trucking has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>dominate</b> the freight industry in the latter portion of the 20th century.|$|E
