500|$|As a {{cross-platform}} project, Chartjackers {{was distributed}} both {{on television and}} through alternative media – {{as well as being}} streamed online through BBC iPlayer, each episode was also uploaded to the YouTube channel BBCSwitch the same day that it was broadcast on TV.

40|$|International audienceUnlike the {{traditional}} media, where users are mere passive consumers of <b>creative</b> <b>contents,</b> digital innovations such as virtual worlds (VWs) empower individuals to also produce online <b>creative</b> <b>contents.</b> Such individuals expend considerable time, energy, and creative effort in producing these user generated contents (UGCs). Despite the voluminous production of such <b>creative</b> <b>contents,</b> the motivations for these VW user-creators remain unclear. Few {{recent studies have}} highlighted {{the role of a}} supportive legal climate in fostering creativity amongst such user-creators. Yet, from a theoretical standpoint, the implications of such a proposition remain empirically untested. In this research-in-progress paper, grounding our arguments in theories on psychological empowerment and creativity, we posit that an empowering legal climate for intellectual property rights management, comprising sets of rights (incentive rights and access rights) influence user creativity. We propose a research model linking legal environment to the psychological empowerment of VW user-creators and their creativity. We plan to test the proposed hypotheses through a survey of VW user -creators. The study, by integrating the role of legal climate on individual creativity in VWs, is expected to make significant contributions to the organizational and information systems literature pertaining to creativity in the VW context. In addition to guiding VW owners in charting appropriate policies for enhancing creativity amongst their users, the study will also help regulators to better formulate laws related to communication policies for fostering creativity in the UGC environment...|$|R

500|$|Chartjackers was devised in 2009 by Jonathan Davenport and Andy Mettam of the British {{production}} company Hat Trick Productions.

500|$|Twitterbots {{are capable}} of {{influencing}} public opinion about culture, products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication. The New York Times states, [...] "They have sleep-wake cycles so their fakery is more convincing, making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs." [...] The tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing, all of which depends on {{the intention of the}} person purchasing or creating the bot. The social implications these Twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the ScienceDirect Journal. Looking at the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the journal notes, [...] "people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media, treating {{them as if they were}} real people or real places." [...] The study concluded that Twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere. While the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful Human-Computer Interaction, the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the Twitter realm. Benign Twitterbots may generate <b>creative</b> <b>content</b> and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular, push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation, spam and/or slander.|$|E

Some of those that departed Sony went on to other projects. For example, executive producer Yoshifusa Hayama joined Bossa Studios to work on social/mobile games, while two Team Ico artists joined an indie startup studio Friends & Foes to develop their first title, Vane, which has been compared visually to The Last Guardian. Ueda and other former Team Ico members, including Jinji Horagai, the lead programmer from Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, created a new studio, genDESIGN. In founding the studio, they were faced with a choice, according to Ueda: [...] "Do we try to create something new, or do we keep going, providing support on The Last Guardian?" [...] genDESIGN opted to commit themselves to helping Sony complete The Last Guardian through contract and working alongside Sony's internal studio, Japan Studio.
