5000|$|Industrial use of piped {{compressed}} air for power transmission {{was developed in}} the mid 19th century; unlike steam, {{compressed air}} could be piped for long distances without losing pressure due to condensation. An early major application of compressed air was in the drilling of the Mont Cenis Tunnel in Switzerland in 1861, where a 600 kPa (87 psi) <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>plant</b> provided power to pneumatic drills, increasing productivity greatly over previous manual drilling methods. Compressed air drills were applied at mines in the United States in the 1870s. George Westinghouse invented air brakes for trains starting in 1869; these brakes considerably improved the safety of rail operations. In the 19th century, Paris had a system of pipes installed for municipal distribution of compressed air to power machines and to operate generators for lighting. Early air compressors were steam-driven, but in certain locations a trompe could directly obtain compressed air from the force of falling water.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe ongoing {{transformation}} of the German energy system calls for both new technologies and new methods to assess the role these technologies can play in future energy scenarios. This paper presents a new methodology that combines detailed thermodynamic process modelling and investor-centered economical evaluation to form an integrated technology assessment of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> energy storage <b>plants.</b> The respective model derives characteristics for charging and discharging operation of these plants from detailed component level process calculations. These characteristics are then processed in a unit commitment model that optimises plant operation in terms of market revenues using mixed integer linear programming. Arbitrary energy systems are represented by time series of spot and tertiary control reserve markets. In a case study, three different plant layouts are investigated using historical data and future price variations on the German energy market. It shows that simple conventional plant layouts would presently generate the highest profitability. Adiabatic storage systems tend to be an even better option if the price spread should increase in future markets. However, the profitability strongly relies on revenues from the control reserve market.

30|$|At the {{distribution}} level, {{it is clear}} that users, from households to hospitals, have very different requirements with respect to the quality, stability and reliability of their electricity supply. This probably means that in addition to the pumped-hydro or <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>plants</b> capable of delivering significant power levels over long enough time periods to ensure continuity of supply, {{the distribution}} grid will also have to incorporate low energy, high discharge rate systems, such as BES, FBES, FES and SMES (see Fig.  3) to guarantee quality. Unfortunately, all of these technologies are intrinsically generators of DC power on discharge. While this may have represented a problem in the past for the AC grid system, recent technology advances in the power supply industries, based on modern power electronics converters, can provide an answer to this mismatch. Developments in flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) aim to provide robust grid control at times of complex operational demand, usually associated with random external disturbances or fluctuations [22]. FACTS are multi-megawatt proven power electronic devices which are being introduced at the present time into the electricity supply networks. Rather than following conventional practice and switching to stand-by, or base load, fossil fuel powered generators in this power interruption scenario, FACTS enable the maintenance of stability on the grid by permitting storage techniques based on DC devices, such as SMES, FES, BES and CES to be incorporated into grid control systems. Thus by employing storage in conjunction with voltage source converters, it is possible to effectively negate or damp oscillations caused by sudden changes in load conditions [22].|$|R

40|$|Air {{compressors}} are {{a significant}} industrial energy user. Based on a survey (conducted by Oregon State University and the Bonneville Power Administration) of energy audit reports from 125 <b>plants,</b> <b>air</b> compressors account for roughly 10 % of total plant energy use. Furthermore, air compression is inefficient with up to 95 % of compressor power dissipated as heat. Thus even minor improvements in system operation, control strategies, and efficiency can yield large energy savings and significant non-energy or productivity benefits from reliable <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> is often called the ""fourth utility"" in industrial facilities after electricity, natural gas, and water.

It is a safe, flexible, and powerful resource, but one that is seldom run for low operating costs or best productivity. Learning the basics of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> systems represents the beginning of both reducing energy costs and enjoying the productive benefits of reliable <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> management systems, including a system approach to managing demand, stabilizing pressure, reducing leaks and compressor controls, can allow the industrial end user to save 20 % - 50 % of their air compressor electricity usage.
