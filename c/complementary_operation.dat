Because the United States Army Air Forces wanted to use its fission bombs on previously undamaged cities in order to have accurate data on nuclear-caused damage, Kokura, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Niigata were preserved from conventional bombing raids.

In heavy metal/ferromagnet/oxide structures, the critical current for SOT-induced switching of perpendicular magnetization is efficiently modulated by an electric field via voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect in a non-volatile manner. Moreover, the polarity of the VCMA is tuned by the modification of oxidation state at the ferromagnet/oxide interface.
