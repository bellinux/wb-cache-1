We should note that this definition of the tradable and non-tradable groups is not free of criticism, namely since it could exist contagion between both groups. In this regard, Barraud and <b>Calfat</b> (2008) analyzing the effect of trade liberalization on wages for Argentina find evidence of significant impacts of trade liberalization on several non-tradable sectors as well as an important shift of manufacturing workers to services, which would indicate that the service sector is also likely to be affected by trade liberalization.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{analysing}} {{the linkages}} between international trade openness and poverty in Argentina. Under a specific-factors setting, a two-step procedure is presented. In {{the first stage}} the change in prices of goods and factors in both tradable and non-tradable sectors, after a trade liberalisation episode, is considered. In a second step, these variations are applied to assess the changes in poverty and households ’ welfare. A microsimulation approach, using households ’ survey data, is applied in this last stage. Poverty is reduced {{as a result of}} the policy, and the households that benefit from this reduction are those linked to the nontradable sectors. ∗Comments to previous versions of this paper received from G. <b>Calfat,</b> M.

30|$|A few papers {{provide some}} {{information}} {{about the status of}} production fragmentation in Latin America based on descriptive analysis. Aminian et al. (2009) compared the economic integration process in East Asia and Latin America, analyzing the characteristics and intensity of intra-bloc and inter-bloc trade. They used a revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index to identify the share of traded manufacture parts and components with comparative advantage in the intra-bloc trade. Curran and Zignago (2013) studied the regionalization of trade in South America from 1994 to 2007, differentiating the trade flows by the end use of the products and the level of embodied technology. They concluded that the trade agreements have not extensively affected the regional trade level and that trade of intermediate products was still very low, indicating that regional production networks were still under-developed. <b>Calfat</b> et al. (2011) investigated the participation of Argentina, Brazil, Guatemala, and Nicaragua in fragmented world production. They concluded that Brazil was the only country with a consolidated participation in fragmented production. Fung et al. (2015 a) used manufacturing trade data, classified according to the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC), to compare production sharing in Latin America, North America, and East Asia from 1985 to 2006. They identified the existence of a relatively thick production network involving the trade of parts of motor vehicles, telecommunication equipment, and electronic components. However, it was concentrated on Mexico’s trade with US and Canada, while Brazil also played a smaller role. Fung et al. (2015 b) used the same data and methodology to compare Brazil, China, and Mexico’s participation in production networks. They analyzed the international trade patterns for the period 1990 – 2010, identifying that China’s global presence in the trade of parts and components increased. Although Mexico concentrated its trade of parts and components with the US, the data showed that China has become a major source of parts and components to Mexico and Brazil. The authors highlight the increasing importance of a Pan-Pacific link and a possible creation of a China–Brazil–Mexico production network.|$|E
