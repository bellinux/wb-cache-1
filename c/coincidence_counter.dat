5000|$|In quantum physics, {{coincidence}} counting is used {{in experiments}} testing particle non-locality and quantum entanglement. In these experiments two or more particles are created from the same initial packet of energy, inexorably linking/entangling their physical properties. Separate particle detectors measure the quantum states of each particle and send the resulting signal to a <b>coincidence</b> <b>counter.</b> In any experiment studying entanglement, the entangled particles are vastly outnumbered by non-entangled particles which are also detected; patternless noise that drowns out the entangled signal. In a two detector system, a <b>coincidence</b> <b>counter</b> alleviates this problem by only recording detection signals that strike both detectors simultaneously (or more accurately, recording only signals that arrive at both detectors and correlate to the same emission time). This ensures that the data represents only entangled particles.|$|E

30|$|Delay between {{starting}} {{times of}} IF and TAC and timing errors for early blood samples {{are likely to}} be among the major causes of variation in previous reports. Without automated sampling tools such as beta probes [20] or <b>coincidence</b> <b>counters</b> operating on a shunt volume [7, 8], {{it is virtually impossible to}} get correctly timed samples because of catheter dead volume and the time needed for transfer between animal and measurement device or for blood plasma separation.

5000|$|Every {{experiment}} to date {{that has been}} used to calculate Bell's inequalities, perform a quantum eraser, or conduct any experiment utilizing quantum entanglement as an information channel has only been possible through the use of <b>coincidence</b> <b>counters.</b> This unavoidably prevents superluminal communication since, even if a random or purposeful decision appears to be affecting events that have already transpired (as in the delayed choice quantum eraser), the signal from the past cannot be seen/decoded until the coincidence circuit has correlated both the past and future behavior. Thus the [...] "signal" [...] in the past is only visible after it is [...] "sent" [...] from the future, precluding quantum entanglement from being exploited for the purposes of faster-than-light communication or data time travel.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{since no}} detector/counter circuit has {{infinitely}} precise temporal resolution (due both to limitations in the electronics {{and the laws}} of the Universe itself), detections must be sorted into time bins (detection windows equivalent to the temporal resolution of the system). Detections in the same bin appear to occur at the same time because their individual detection times cannot be resolved any further. Thus in a two detector system, two unrelated, non-entangled particles may randomly strike both detectors, get sorted into the same time bin, and create a false-coincidence that adds noise to the signal. This limits <b>coincidence</b> <b>counters</b> to improving the signal to noise ratio {{to the extent that the}} quantum behavior can be studied, without removing the noise completely.|$|R
50|$|The total {{pattern of}} all signal photons at D0, whose {{entangled}} idlers went to multiple different detectors, will never show interference {{regardless of what}} happens to the idler photons. One can get an idea of how this works by looking at the graphs of R01, R02, R03, and R04, and observing that the peaks of R01 line up with the troughs of R02 (i.e. a π phase shift exists between the two interference fringes). R03 shows a single maximum, and R04, which is experimentally identical to R03 will show equivalent results. The entangled photons, as filtered {{with the help of the}} <b>coincidence</b> <b>counter,</b> are simulated in Fig. 5 to give a visual impression of the evidence available from the experiment. In D0, the sum of all the correlated counts will not show interference. If all the photons that arrive at D0 were to be plotted on one graph, one would see only a bright central band.|$|E

5000|$|Similar to {{the case}} of Young's double slit experiment, the {{classical}} and the quantum description lead to the same result, {{but that does not mean}} that two descriptions are equivalent. Classically, the light beams arrives as an electromagnetic wave and interferes owing to the superposition principle. The quantum description is not as straightforward. To understand the subtleties in the quantum description, assume that photons from the source are emitted independent of each other at the source and that the photons are not split by the beam splitter. When the intensity of the source is set to be very low, such that only one photon might be detected at any time, accounting for the fact that there might be accidental coincidences, which are statistically independent of time, the <b>coincidence</b> <b>counter</b> should not change with respect to the time difference. However, as shown in Figure 3., for stellar light , so without any time delay [...] and with a large time delay [...] Hence, even when there was no time-delay the photons from the source were arriving in pairs! This effect is termed photon bunching. Moreover, if a laser light was used at the source instead of chaotic light, then second order coherence would be independent of the time delay. HBT's experiment allows for a fundamentally distinction in the way in which photons are emitted from a laser compared to a natural light source. Such a distinction is not captured by the classical description on wave interference.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{real-time}} neutron/?-ray pulse-shape discrimination {{has become}} feasible {{for use with}} scintillator-based detectors that respond extremely quickly, {{on the order of}} 25 ns in terms of pulse width, and their application to a variety of nuclear material assays has been reported. For the in-situ analysis of nuclear materials, measurements are often based on the multiplicity assessment of spontaneous fission events. An example of this is the 240 Pueff assessment stemming from long-established techniques developed for 3 He-based neutron <b>coincidence</b> <b>counters</b> when 3 He was abundant and cheap. However, such measurements when using scintillator detectors can be plagued by low detection efficiencies and low orders of coincidence (often limited to triples) if the number of detectors in use is similarly limited to 3 or 4. Conversely, an array of > 10 detector modules arranged to optimize efficiency and multiplicity sensitivity, shifts the emphasis in terms of performance requirement to the real-time digital analyzer and, critically, to the scope remaining in the temporal processing window of the firmware in these systems. In this paper we report on the design, development and commissioning of a custom-built, 16 -channel real-time pulse-shape discrimination analyzer specified for the materials assay challenge summarized above. The analyzer incorporates 16 dedicated and independent high-voltage supplies along with 16 independent digital processing channels offering pulse-shape discrimination at a rate of 3 × 106 events per second.
