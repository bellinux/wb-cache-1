The Central Bank was forced to devalue the peso at an unprecedented rate: the peso lost about 70% of its value from early 1948 to early 1950, leading to a decline in the imports fueling industrial growth and to recession. Short of central bank reserves, Perón was forced to borrow US$125million from the U.S. Export-Import Bank to cover a number of private banks' debts to U.S. institutions, without which their insolvency would have become a <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>liability.</b> Austerity and better harvests in 1950 helped finance a recovery in 1951; but inflation, having risen from 13% in 1948 to 31% in 1949, reached 50% in late 1951 before stabilizing, and a second, sharper recession soon followed. Workers' purchasing power, by 1952, had declined 20% from its 1948 high and GDP, having leapt by a fourth during Perón's first two years, saw zero growth from 1948 to 1952. (The U.S. economy, by contrast, grew by about a fourth in the same interim). After 1952, however, wages began rising in real terms once more.|$|E
40|$|It has {{recently}} been argued that intra-eurosystem claims and liabilities {{in the form of}} TARGET 2 balances would raise fundamental issues within the European monetary union. This article provides a framework for the economic analysis of TARGET 2 balances and discusses the key arguments behind this recent debate. The analysis is conducted within a system of financial accounts in which TARGET 2 balances can arise either due to current account transactions or cross-border capital flows. It is argued that the recent volatility of TARGET 2 balances reflects capital flow movements, while the previously prevailing current account positions did not find a strong reflection in TARGET 2 balances. Some recent statements regarding TARGET 2 appear to be due to a failure to distinguish between the monetary base (a <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>liability</b> concept) and the liquidity deficit of the banking system vis-à-vis the central bank (a central bank asset concept). Furthermore, the article highlights the importance of TARGET 2 for the stability of the euro area and points out that the proposal to limit the size of TARGET 2 liabilities essentially contradicts the idea of a monetary union.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the implications for}} monetary policy of a decreasing demand for outside money. It finds that even perpetual declines in the demand for base money pose no threat to the traditional methods employed for conducting monetary policy. The effects of such reductions in the demand for <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities,</b> however, do depend on how monetary policy is conducted. Four monetary policy regimes are analyzed. With a policy of nominal-interest-rate targeting, a secular decline in the volume of cash transactions unambiguously leads to accelerating inflation. A policy of maintaining a fixed composition of government liabilities leads to accelerating (decelerating) inflation if agents have sufficiently high (low) levels of risk aversion. Inflation targeting produces falling nominal and real interest rates, while a policy of fixing the rate of money growth can easily lead to indeterminacy and endogenous oscillation in interest rates. It is argued that a policy of fixing the composition of government liabilities has several advantages if {{it is known that}} agents are not too risk averse and that the asymptotic demand for base money is small. If this information is not known, then interest-rate or inflation targeting have an advantage because their consequences are not sensitive to such environmental features.

By mid- 2009, the outstanding amount of MNB bills reached HUF 3, 000 billion, which – in addition to representing one third of the <b>central</b> <b>bank’s</b> <b>liabilities</b> – accounts for {{a significant part of the}} domestic banking sector’s liquid assets. By using the two-week bill to absorb the excess liquidity of the <b>banking</b> sector, the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> ensures that developments in banks’ interest rates will be driven by the MNB bill as an opportunity cost. The volume of these liquid assets builds up gradually, regardless of banks’ willingness to lend. Indeed, the growth observed in the holdings of MNB bills helped to relieve the liquidity tensions of credit institutions and contributed to gradually reducing the role of this factor in the decline in lending activity in 2009. Nonetheless, lending remained restrained despite the ample liquidity, which primarily reflects banks’ deteriorating risk appetite. One of the major correlations in the <b>central</b> <b>bank’s</b> balance sheet is the fact that, while credit institutions are free to decide on the volume of two-week MNB bills they purchase at the individual level, they are unable to affect the volume of bills in the overall banking sector. The accelerated growth rate in the volume of two-week bills observed in the previous year resulted from the use of foreign currency loans to finance the general government, which implies that the large volume of two-week bills is a consequence of poor demand in the government securities market, rather than the reason for this. In a regional comparison, however, the relatively high <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> base rate does not affect the volume of the key instrument, as the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> interest rate has no direct impact on the liquidity of the <b>banking</b> sector. <b>central</b> banks' monetary policy instruments, open market operations, determining interest rates. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Central</b> <b>banks</b> {{no longer}} set the {{short-term}} interest rates that they use for monetary policy purposes by manipulating the supply of banking system reserves, as in conventional economics textbooks; this process normally involves little or no variation in the supply of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities.</b> In effect, the announcement effect has displaced the liquidity effect as the fulcrum of monetary policy implementation. The chapter begins with an exposition of the traditional view of the implementation of monetary policy, and {{an assessment of the}} relationship between the quantity of reserves, appropriately defined, and the level of {{short-term interest rates}}. Event studies show no relationship between the two for the United States, the Euro-system, or Japan. Structural estimates of banks' reserve demand, at a frequency corresponding to the required reserve maintenance period, show no interest elasticity for the U. S. or the Euro-system (but some elasticity for Japan). The chapter next develops a model of the overnight interest rate setting process incorporating several key features of current monetary policy practice, including in particular reserve averaging procedures and a commitment, either explicit or implicit, by the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> to lend or absorb reserves in response to differences between the policy interest rate and the corresponding target. A key implication is that if reserve demand depends on the difference between current and expected future interest rates, but not on the current level per se, then the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> can alter the market-clearing interest rate with no change in reserve supply. This implication is borne out in structural estimates of daily reserve demand and supply in the U. S. : expected future interest rates shift banks' reserve demand, while changes in the interest rate target are associated with no discernable change in reserve supply. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the implementation of monetary policy during the recent financial crisis, and the conditions under which the interest rate and the size of the <b>central</b> <b>bank's</b> balance sheet could function as two independent policy instruments.

This paper analyzes the impact of the trilemma on China's monetary policy as the country liberalizes its good and financial markets and integrates with the world economy. It shows how China has sought to insulate its reserve money from the effects of balance of payments inflows by sterilizing through the issuance of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities.</b> However, we report empirical results indicating that sterilization dropped precipitously in 2006 in the face of the ongoing massive buildup of international reserves, leading to a surge in reserve money growth. We also estimate a vector error correction model linking the surge in China's reserve money to broad money, real GDP, and the price level. We use this model to explore the inflationary implications of different policy scenarios. Under a scenario of continued rapid reserve money growth (consistent with limited sterilization of foreign exchange reserve accumulation) and strong economic growth, the model predicts a rapid increase in inflation. A model simulation using an extension of the framework that incorporates recent increases in bank reserve requirements also implies a rapid rise in inflation. By contrast, model simulations incorporating a sharp slowdown in economic growth such as that seen in late 2008 and 2009 lead to less inflation pressure even with a substantial buildup in international reserves.

40|$|The author {{presents}} {{evidence that}} balance sheet effects are critical determinants {{of both the}} likelihood of a crisis and of income losses following a crisis. She tests the validity of"insurance"and"liquidity"models of currency crisis. Both models predict that the occurrence of a balance of payments crisis is conditional on the health of the nation's accounts in relation {{to the rest of the}} world. Problems in the balance sheet either cause a financial crisis that develops into a run on the <b>central</b> <b>bank,</b> or generate a run on the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> once contingent <b>liabilities</b> exceed reserves and the yield differential moves against domestic assets. Estimations of crisis likelihoods based on several specifications of single and simultaneous equation probit models confirm that output losses following the crisis are persistent and conditional on the balance sheet indicator, that is, the ratio of the stock of gross external liabilities to assets. Measures of contingent liabilities, capital flight, and financial depth perform well as crisis predictors, and the marginal effects on the probability of a crisis are of the expected sign. The panel data set covers the time period 1973 through 2003 for 90 countries.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} nature of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> {{involvement}} in 26 episodes of financial disturbance and crises in Latin America from the mid- 1990 s onwards. It finds that, except {{in a handful of}} cases, large amounts of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money were used to cope with large and small crises alike. Pouring <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money into the financial system generally derailed monetary policy, fueled further macroeconomic unrest, and contributed to simultaneous currency crises, thereby aggravating financial instability. In contrast, when <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money issuance was restricted and bank resolution was timely executed, financial disturbances were handled with less economic cost. However, this strategy worked provided appropriate institutional arrangements were in place, which highlights the importance of building a suitable framework for preventing and managing banking crises.
