5|$|The victory {{strengthened}} Tang {{control of}} the Western Regions, now modern Xinjiang, and brought the regions formerly ruled by the Khaganate into the Tang empire. Puppet qaghans, the Turkic title for ruler, and military garrisons were installed to administer the newly acquired territories. The Tang Dynasty achieved its maximum extent as China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Arabic Umayyad Caliphate. Later on, Turkic revolts ended Chinese hegemony beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern Tajikistan and Afghanistan, but a Tang military presence remained in Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin. <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> absorbed cultural influences from the conflict. Turkic culture and language spread into <b>Central</b> <b>Asia,</b> as did artistic and political influences from the Tang Dynasty. Many of the Tang generals and soldiers stationed in the region were ethnically Turkic, and the prevalence of Indo-European languages in <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> declined with acceleration of Turkic migration. The Turks, Tibetans, and the Tang competed for control over <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> {{for the next few}} centuries.|$|E

A contingent of Sogdian soldiers fought in the main army of Xerxes I during his ultimately failed invasion of Greece in 480 BC.
