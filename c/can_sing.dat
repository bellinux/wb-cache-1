However, {{on his way to}} school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who {{convince}} him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who <b>can</b> <b>sing</b> and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free, while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him.|$|E

25|$|Sébastien, popular melody or voix populi to a loud, {{so it has}} a tenor tessitura phonic. The tessitura of {{this voice}} type will be typical of a common tenor, albeit with a lighter tone sans operatic training. Sébastien's voice is {{distinguished}} by its clear and bright timbre, the pectoral resonance and firmness in voice projection. The extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he <b>can</b> <b>sing</b> from G2 up to B4.|$|E
25|$|David, lyric tenor. The lyric tenor is a warm graceful {{voice with}} a bright, full timbre that is strong but not heavy {{and can be}} heard over an orchestra. Lyric tenors have a range from {{approximately}} the C one octave below middle C (C3) to the D one octave above middle C (D5). The extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he <b>can</b> <b>sing</b> from C3 up to E5. A very quick, falsettoed E5 can be heard on their first album in the song Hoy Que Ya No Estas Aqui.|$|E
25|$|A karaoke bar, {{restaurant}}, club or lounge is a bar or {{restaurant that}} provides karaoke equipment {{so that people}} <b>can</b> <b>sing</b> publicly, sometimes on a small stage. Most of these establishments allow patrons to sing for free, {{with the expectation that}} sufficient revenue will be made selling food and drink to the singers. Less commonly, the patron wishing to sing must pay a small fee for each song they sing. Both are financially beneficial for the establishment by not having to pay a professional singer or a cabaret tax which is usually applied to any entertainment of more than 1 person.|$|E

25|$|Urs, Tenor, {{most likely}} a Heldentenor. As its name implies, the heldentenor vocal fach {{features}} in the German romantic operatic repertoire. The heldentenor is the German equivalent of the tenore drammatico, however with a more baritonal quality. Therefore, the heldentenor voice {{might or might not}} have facility up to high B or C. The repertoire, however, rarely calls for such high notes. This seems to be evident in Il Divo's repertoire: the extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he <b>can</b> <b>sing</b> from G2 up to C5. However, Buhler himself once revealed from a video chat with fans that he could sing from C2 up to G5.|$|E
25|$|Vibrato is a {{technique}} in which a sustained note wavers very quickly and consistently between a higher and a lower pitch, giving the note a slight quaver. Vibrato is the pulse or wave in a sustained tone. Vibrato occurs naturally and {{is the result of}} proper breath support and a relaxed vocal apparatus. Some studies have shown that vibrato {{is the result of a}} neuromuscular tremor in the vocal folds. In 1922 Max Schoen was the first to make the comparison of vibrato to a tremor due to change in amplitude, lack of automatic control and it being half the rate of normal muscular discharge. Some singers use vibrato as a means of expression. Many successful artists <b>can</b> <b>sing</b> a deep, rich vibrato.|$|E
25|$|Carlos, Verdi baritone. Incorporating {{the deep}} tones that a bass has, while having an upper range {{approaching}} {{that of a}} tenor, Carlos' voice type is high even for a usual baritone. A Verdi baritone refers to a voice capable of singing consistently and with ease in the highest part of the baritone range, up to A4, sometimes even up to the B♭4. The extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he <b>can</b> <b>sing</b> from G♭2 up to B♭4. The *unofficial* sheet music for their first album claims he sings down to a D2, however this is atypical of a baritone. Most basses would not even be required to sing such notes. During the Live at The Greek Theatre concert, he hit B4 singing I Believe in You.|$|E

Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly found the song left him [...] "feeling absolutely nothing".
