5|$|Bats play an {{important}} role in forest and cave ecology in Puerto Rico and help control mosquito populations. Most species (10 of 13) are cave-dwellers with low reproductive rates; the area with the highest species richness is the Caribbean National Forest, where eleven species occur. The red fig-eating bat (red fruit bat), endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank, plays {{an important}} role in the ecology of tabonuco forest in the Luquillo Mountains since it is believed to be the only seed disperser of bulletwood (Manilkara bidentata). Cave ecosystems are enhanced by bat feces (guano) since many of the invertebrate <b>cave</b> <b>fauna</b> are either guano scavengers, detritivores or predators of the former two.|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys antillarum, {{also known}} as the Jamaican rice rat, is an extinct rodent of Jamaica.

O.antillarum is common in subfossil <b>cave</b> <b>faunas</b> and is also known from three specimens collected live in the 19th century. Some historical records of Jamaican rats may pertain to it.

40|$|Submarine <b>cave</b> <b>faunas</b> remain poorly understood, {{and only}} a few stygobite podocopid ostracods are known.

This species is endemic to the submarine cave environment. At least part of its enigmatic morphology, especially the distinct pore clusters in the anterior and posterior parts, is probably an adaptation to the submarine cave environment. There is no clear morphological evidence to indicate that Tabukicypris decoris is a ‘living fossil’. The morphological characters of this stygobite indicate three possible origins of this species: from a deep-sea, interstitial or tropical open shallow-marine environment...|$|R

40|$|A {{system is}} {{proposed}} for classifying the species {{occurring in the}} hypogean environment {{in relation to their}} ecological and evolutionary characteristics. The ecological criteria utilized relate to the preferred habitat of the animals (the epigean, endogean or hypogean environment) and the evolutionary criteria specify the grade of adaptive modification in three characteristics: reduction of eyes, amount of pigmentation and extent of elongation of the appendages. The object of developing this classification is to provide a system appropriate for those regions - such as those with volcanic rocks - in which the <b>cave</b> <b>faunas</b> include elements originating in different environments, and in which the species show very variable adaptive grades, depending primarily on the antiquity of the island or other distinct geological zone, where they are found...|$|R

50|$|Caves {{also appear}} to have become the last {{refugium}} for many ancient types of insects, which are no longer found free in the open in surrounding regions.

In this paper, we describe three new species of Paramisophria from the Spanish zone of the Mediterranean, where they apparently follow an allopatric depth zonation pattern extending from the upper littoral to depths in excess of 1200 m. Additionally, the discovery of deep-water species has provided new evidence relevant to the deep-sea / shallow-water controversy on the origin of anchialine <b>cave</b> <b>faunas</b> (see Stock, 1986) from our analysis of the phylogenetic relationships between Paramisophria species and of the type of habitat exploited by each...|$|R
