60|$|These statistics, however {{accidental}} {{and therefore}} uninstructive they may appear, {{as they have}} a certain completeness, have a certain value also. Nothing was given me of which I have not rendered some account. It appears from the above estimate, that my food alone cost me in money about twenty-seven cents a week. It was, {{for nearly two years}} after this, rye and Indian meal without yeast, potatoes, rice, a very little salt pork, molasses, and salt; and my drink, water. It was fit that I should live on rice, mainly, who love so well the philosophy of India. To meet the objections of some inveterate cavillers, I may as well state, that if I dined out occasionally, as I always had done, and I trust shall have opportunities to do again, it was frequently to the detriment of my domestic arrangements. But the dining out, being, as I have stated, a constant element, does not in the least affect a <b>comparative</b> <b>statement</b> like this.|$|E

40|$|Can <b>comparative</b> <b>statements</b> be {{credible}} even when absolute statements are not? For instance, can a professor credibly rank different {{students for a}} prospective employer even if she has an incentive to exaggerate the merits of each student? Or can an analyst credibly rank different stocks even if the client would be dubious about a recommendation to buy any one of them? We examine such problems in a multidimensional sender-receiver game where the sender has private information about multiple variables. We show that ordinal cheap talk, in which the variables are completely ordered by value or grouped into categories by value, can {{be credible}} even when interests are too opposed to support communication along any single dimension. Ordinal cheap talk is credible because it reveals both favorable and unfavorable information at the same time, thereby precluding any possibility of exaggeration. The communication gains from ordinal cheap talk can be substantial with {{only a couple of}} dimensions, and the payoffs from a complete ordering are asymptotically equivalent to full revelation as the number of variables becomes large. However, in some circumstances the sender can do better through a partial ordering that categorizes variables. Compared to other forms of cheap talk, ordinal cheap talk is exceedingly simple in that the sender only makes straightforward, <b>comparative</b> <b>statements...</b>|$|R

We find that an expert with state-independent preferences can always make credible <b>comparative</b> <b>statements</b> that trade off the expert’s incentive to exaggerate on each dimension. Such communication benefits the expert – cheap talk is “persuasive ” – if her preferences are quasiconvex. Communication benefits a decision maker by allowing for a more informed decision, but strategic interactions between multiple decision makers can reverse this gain. We apply these results to topics including product recommendations, voting, auction disclosure, and advertising...|$|R

5000|$|With {{regards to}} their vamsha (whether {{they belonged to}} Surya Vamsha (solar lineage) or Chandra Vamsha (lunar lineage), Rashtrakuta {{inscriptions}} remained silent on the issue, until about 860. Some 75 inscriptions have been found thereafter in the Deccan and Gujarat which speak about their vamsha. Of these, only 8 lay claim that they belonged to the Yadava line. While one inscription of 860 claims that King Dantidurga was born to the Yadava Satyaki, 1800 coins of King Krishna I (772), his successor calls him Parama Mahesvara indicating his solar lineage origin and Shaiva faith. An inscription of King Govinda III (808) mentions [...] "by the birth of this virtuous king, the Rashtrakuta dynasty became invincible just as the Yadava dynasty by the birth of Lord Krishna". This is considered only a <b>comparative</b> <b>statement.</b> Only a few records attest to a possible Yadava connection and even {{the descendants of the}} Rashtrakutas such as the Gahadavalas of Kanauj, Rathors of Rajasthan claim to be from Surya Vamsha (solar lineage), a sure sign the Rashtrakutas belonged to the Surya Vamsha.

5000|$|The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) {{provides}} voluntary {{guidelines for}} environmental marketing claims. These guidelines give the FTC {{the right to}} prosecute false and misleading advertisement claims. The green guidelines were not created {{to be used as}} an enforceable guideline but instead were intended to be followed voluntarily. Listed below are the green guidelines set by the FTC.*Qualifications and disclosures: The Commission traditionally has held that in order to be effective, any qualifications or disclosures such as those described in these guides should be sufficiently clear, prominent and understandable to prevent deception. Clarity of language, relative type size and proximity to the claim being qualified, and an absence of contrary claims that could undercut effectiveness, will maximize the likelihood that the qualifications and disclosures are appropriately clear and prominent.*Distinction between benefits of product, package and service: An environmental marketing claim should be presented {{in a way that makes}} clear whether the environmental attribute or benefit being asserted refers to the product, the product's packaging, a service or to a portion or component of the product, package or service. In general, if the environmental attribute or benefit applies to all but minor, incidental components of a product or package, the claim need not be qualified to identify that fact. There may be exceptions to this general principle. For example, if an unqualified [...] "recyclable" [...] claim is made and the presence of the incidental component significantly limits the ability to recycle the product, then the claim would be deceptive.*Overstatement of environmental attribute: An environmental marketing claim should not be presented in a manner that overstates the environmental attribute or benefit, expressly or by implication. Marketers should avoid implications of significant environmental benefits if the benefit is in fact negligible.*Comparative claims: Environmental marketing claims that include a <b>comparative</b> <b>statement</b> should be presented in a manner that makes the basis for the comparison sufficiently clear to avoid consumer deception. In addition, the advertiser should be able to substantiate the comparison.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that unguided {{decision}} making might lead to inefficient and nonoptimal decisions, decisions made at organizational levels seldom utilise decisionanalytical tools. Several gaps between the decision-makers and the computer baseddecision tools exist, and a main problem in managerial decision-making involves {{the lack of information}} and precise objective data, i. e. uncertainty and imprecision may be inherent in the decision situation. We believe that this problem might be overcome by providing computer based decision tools capable of handling the uncertainty inherent in real-life decision-making. At present, nearly all decision analytic software is only able to handle precise input, and no known software is capable of handling full scale imprecision, i. e. imprecise probabilities, values and weights, in the form of interval and <b>comparative</b> <b>statements.</b> There are, however, some theories which are able to handle some kind of uncertainty, and which deal with computational and implementational issues, but if they are never actually operationalised, they are of little real use for a decision-maker. Therefore, a natural question is how a reasonable decision analytical framework can be built based on prevailing interval methods, thus dealing with the problems of uncertain and imprecise input? Further, will the interval approach actually prove useful? The framework presented herein handles theoretical foundations for, and implementations of, imprecise multi-level trees, multi-criteria, risk analysis, together with several different evaluation options. The framework supports interval probabilities, values, and criteria weights, as well as <b>comparative</b> <b>statements,</b> also allowing for mixing probabilistic and multi-criteria decisions. The framework has also been field tested in a number of studies, proving the usefulness of the interval approach...|$|R
