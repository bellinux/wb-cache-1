50|$|The <b>Cornbelt</b> Conference {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} high school {{athletic}} conferences in Iowa. Tracing its history to the 1930s, the <b>Cornbelt</b> has always been a conference filled by smaller schools. Beginning in the late 1970s, frequent membership changes happened because the league consisted of some of the smallest schools in the state. Currently, the conference has 6 teams, but four members will be leaving in 2014, and another is exploring options for whole grade sharing that would end its independent sports program.|$|E

5000|$|After {{more than}} five decades of {{ownership}} by the Livesay family, <b>Cornbelt</b> Broadcasting Company (James R. Livesay II, president) reached an agreement in late November 2003 to transfer the broadcast license for this station to WHOW Radio, LLC (led by Bill Brady) along with FM sister station WHOW-FM for a reported combined sale price of $300,000. [...] The deal {{was approved by the}} FCC on January 26, 2004, and the transaction was consummated on February 9, 2004.|$|E

Inspired by the April 1987 opening of the Clinton Nuclear Generating Station, WHOW changed its motto to [...] "WHOW, your radio active station" [...] in 1989.|$|E
5000|$|The {{town and}} lake {{are located in}} the rural foothills of the Ozarks, just 45 minutes outside of Springfield. Stockton, along with there rest of south Missouri, are often {{referred}} to culturally and geographically by historians and geographers as [...] "The Gateway to Dixie". The area seems to resemble Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Appalachia in many ways more than it does the rest of Missouri which carries a more industrial <b>cornbelt</b> feel found throughout the Midwest. Stockton is surrounded by rolling hills, rocky terrain, winding rivers, pristine lakes, cattle ranches, and heavily forested woods. The majority of the towns original settlers came into the area from the Southeast.|$|E
50|$|After {{years of}} {{stability}} as a ten-team league, 2009 saw the league add Remsen-Union (formerly of the Western Valley Activities Conference) and Hartley-Melvin-Sanborn (formerly a Siouxland Conference member). In 2010, Sergeant Bluff-Luton, the lone 3A {{school in the}} conference, left the conference to join the Missouri River Activities Conference, which contains four large schools in nearby Sioux City and two Council Bluffs schools. Spalding Catholic merged with Gehlen Catholic before the 2013-14 school year. Trinity Christian of Hull took Spalding Catholic's spot in the schedule.

50|$|The Northwest Conference {{was formed}} for the 1996-97 {{athletic}} year. The conference {{was formed to}} meet the needs of nine small 1A schools located in the heart of Northwestern Iowa. After Alta and Aurelia ended a 7-year sports-only sharing agreement, the bigger Twin Lakes Conference was not seen as a good fit for them. Newell-Fonda, Pomeroy-Palmer, and Schaller-Crestland had long histories in the Bo-Coon conference, which had recently dissolved. So the conference was created in 1996 with three of the smaller Twin Lakes Conference schools (Alta, Aurelia, and Sac City), two <b>Cornbelt</b> conference schools who had been longtime rivals of Alta and Aurelia respectively (Sioux Central and Albert City-Truesdale), three old Bo-Coon schools who had recently merged with other nearby schools (Schaller-Crestland, Pomeroy-Palmer, and Newell-Fonda), and longtime independent Storm Lake St. Mary's.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of its {{nomination}} it consisted of 24 resources, which included eight contributing buildings, two contributing structures, one non-contributing building, and 13 non-contributing structures. [...] The historic buildings include the farmhouse (1910), wash house and possible summer kitchen (c. 1910), auto garage (C. 1936), the massive gambrel roofed barn (1936), feed shed (1936), machine shed (1936), hen house (1940), and the hog house (1941). The unique drive-thru corn crib (1936) and the water tower (c. 1920) are the structures. The large farmhouse is a rural vernacular form of the American Foursquare known as the <b>Cornbelt</b> Cube. It is a two story frame structure capped by a hip roof. It has an odd wing on the northwest side that houses the main kitchen on the first floor and a bedroom on the second.|$|E
50|$|Kasbeer is an unincorporated {{community}} in Bureau County, Illinois, United States. Kasbeer is located along Illinois Route 26, north of Princeton {{and south of}} Ohio. The town of Kasbeer was originally begun 1/2-mile {{to the south of}} its current location, but formed when the railroad routed its tracks to the north. This small rural <b>cornbelt</b> town was named after Asa Kasbeer, a very successful farmer on that land, and his family. Currently, the town has only a Church and Post Office, other than its 30 houses and Grain Elevator; however, in an earlier time also had a two-building Grade School, General Store and gas station, barber shop, auto mechanic's garage, lumber yard, small cement block plant, television sales and service store, tavern, and for a short while a bank. Kasbeer is one of many small towns which is within the Princeton School District.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, Ruthven and Ayrshire consolidated. Albert City-Truesdale {{joined the}} league from the Twin Lakes to keep {{membership}} at 14. The next season Ocheyedan left the league {{to merge with}} a larger school, Sibley. In 1988, Arnolds Park High School was closed, as its district was merged with Milford to form Okoboji High School. Clay Central and Everly merged the next year, leaving the conference with 11 schools. In 1991, membership was boosted back to 14 despite Sioux Rapids-Rembrandt and Sioux Valley merging to become Sioux Central. The Stateline Conference folded, leaving the <b>Cornbelt</b> to pickup league members Lincoln Central in Gruver, Armstrong-Ringsted, Sentral-Burt of Fenton, and North Kossuth in Swea City. Membership decreased back to 12 the next season as West Bend merged with Mallard and Lincoln Central left the conference after one season to merge with much larger Estherville High School. South Clay closed its high school for the 1994-95 school year, allowing its students the freedom to attend whichever school they prefer. However, many went to Sioux Central. Membership dipped to eight in 1996-97. Albert City-Truesdale and Sioux Central left the league to help found the Northwest Conference. Meanwhile, Terril began sharing sports with Ruthven-Ayrshire under the name Lakeland.|$|E
50|$|The boys' golf {{team has}} won the IHSA state {{championship}} 7 years running, and the girls' golf team has won it 4 years in a row. U-High is also known for its basketball program which was home to coach Cal Hubbard. The swimming, boys' tennis, cross country, cheerleading, wrestling, football, and soccer teams along with many others are also highly competitive in the IHSA. The U-High girls' basketball team has had at least 20 wins in the past 4 seasons and since 1992 have 13 Regional Titles, 7 Sectional Titles with a 3rd and a 4th-place finish. The U-High girls' soccer team won 5 straight Regional Titles from 2007- 2011 and in 2010 won their first Sectional Championship in the past 7 years.

40|$|The 2008 Farm Bill {{provided}} {{an option for}} receiving commodity program payments through existing programs or a new revenue-based alternative – the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program. ACRE is a state-level revenue program which, if elected, replaces the price-based countercyclical program. Enrollment requires the forfeiture of 20 percent of a producer’s direct payments and reduces loan rates by 30 percent. This article provides estimates of long-term expected ACRE payments for corn, soybean, and wheat acres {{across a variety of}} states. Within the <b>cornbelt,</b> expected ACRE payments are similar across regions for each of the crops considered, and will likely exceed the required reduction in direct payments. Outside of the <b>cornbelt,</b> expected ACRE payments vary considerably. Farm Management, Production Economics,...|$|E
