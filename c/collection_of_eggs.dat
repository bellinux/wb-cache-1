25|$|The {{earliest}} {{approaches to}} modern bird study involved the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs,</b> a practice known as oology. While collecting became a pastime for many amateurs, the labels {{associated with these}} early egg collections made them unreliable for the serious study of bird breeding. In order to preserve eggs, a tiny hole was pierced and the contents extracted. This technique became standard with {{the invention of the}} blow drill around 1830. Egg collection is no longer popular; however historic museum collections have been of value in determining the effects of pesticides such as DDT on physiology. Museum bird collections continue to act as a resource for taxonomic studies.|$|E

As part of a programme of research by the Inland Fisheries Trust into the biology of the bass, Dicerntrarchus labrax (L.) in Irish waters, tow-netting for bass eggs was carried out at four centres on the southeast and south coasts of Ireland during the period April to June 1967. Pelagic <b>eggs</b> <b>of</b> a variety of species of fish, including bass, were obtained, as well as larvae, post-larvae and fry.

50|$|Khaki Campbells become mature at {{approximately}} 7 months. Khaki Campbell ducks seldom hatch out others' young; however, in very communal situations do hatch large broods together. Most brooding behavior has been sacrificed {{in exchange for}} prolific egg laying ability in this breed. The ducks, when raised by hand, are not usually defensive of their eggs or nests, making <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> very easy. Mechanical incubators or broody chickens are used to hatch out Khaki Campbell ducklings when ducks are not present in the process. Incubation takes approximately 23 to 28 days for a Khaki Campbell duckling to hatch and eggs need to be inspected for ducklings that have not emerged from their egg completely.|$|E

Activities take place year round but most turtles come here to nest between July and November.
