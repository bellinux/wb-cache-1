25|$|R2 is a {{statistic}} {{that will give}} some information about the goodness of fit of a model. In regression, the R2 <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> is {{a statistic}}al measure of how well the regression line approximates the real data points. An R2 of 1 indicates that the regression line perfectly fits the data.|$|E
25|$|If x and y are {{results of}} {{measurements}} that contain measurement error, the realistic limits on the correlation coefficient are not −1 to +1 but a smaller range. For {{the case of a}} linear model with a single independent variable, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> (R squared) is the square of r, Pearson's product-moment coefficient.|$|E

25|$|R-squared is the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> {{indicating}} goodness-of-fit of the regression. This statistic will {{be equal}} to one if fit is perfect, and to zero when regressors X have no explanatory power whatsoever.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{definitions}} of R2 {{that are only}} sometimes equivalent. One class of such cases includes that of simple linear regression where r2 is used instead of R2. When an intercept is included, then r2 is simply {{the square of the}} sample correlation coefficient (i.e., r) between the observed outcomes and the observed predictor values. If additional regressors are included, R2 is the square of the coefficient of multiple correlation. In both such cases, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> ranges from 0 to 1.|$|E
