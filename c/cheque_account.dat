50|$|In 1974 the Co-operative Bank offered free banking for {{personal}} customers {{who remained in}} credit. It {{was also the first}} clearing bank to offer an interest-bearing <b>cheque</b> <b>account,</b> in 1982.|$|E
50|$|A credit {{provider}} may suspend {{a credit}} facility (like {{a credit card}} or <b>cheque</b> <b>account)</b> at any time if the consumer is in default, or otherwise close the facility on ten business days’ notice.|$|E
50|$|Business Banking {{products}} and services include business lending, <b>cheque</b> <b>accounts,</b> credit cards, investments, merchant services, payment services and insurance.|$|R
50|$|As {{the bank}} {{expanded}} into online banking it also grew to offer mortgages, RRSPs, TFSAs, GICs, {{mutual funds and}} a no-fee <b>chequing</b> <b>account.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 2005, ING Vysya Bank named Ned Swarup to the CEO and MD role. ING Vysya {{launched}} a <b>cheque</b> <b>account</b> product for mid-sized businesses. It also rolled-out its own proprietary online money transfer service.|$|E
50|$|Since the tax {{applied only}} to cheque accounts, bank {{customers}} could choose {{not to have a}} cheque facility to avoid the tax, or could keep a separate <b>cheque</b> <b>account</b> used only when needing to write a cheque.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} a credit guarantee, a third party agrees to pay to a {{creditor}} the amount due by a consumer, on demand (as, for example, {{in the case of}} suretyship, in terms of which personal security is provided for the debt of another person resulting from an overdrawn <b>cheque</b> <b>account).</b>|$|E
50|$|Transaction {{accounts}} are known {{by a variety}} of descriptions, including a current <b>account</b> (British English), <b>chequing</b> <b>account</b> or checking account when held by a bank, share draft account when held by a credit union in North America. In the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, India {{and a number of other}} countries, they are commonly called current or <b>cheque</b> <b>accounts.</b> Because money is available on demand they are also sometimes known as a demand accounts or demand deposit accounts. In the United States, NOW accounts operate as transaction accounts.|$|R
50|$|Midland {{responded to}} the ending of credit {{restrictions}} in 1958 by extending its branch network and by introducing a series of innovative services, including personal loans (1958), personal <b>cheque</b> <b>accounts</b> (1958) and <b>cheque</b> cards (1966).|$|R
50|$|Secured bank loans, {{credit card}} or <b>cheque</b> <b>accounts</b> {{fall under the}} {{category}} “credit facility.” The maximum interest rate is also linked to the SARB Bank Repurchase Rate, and is currently 29.8 per cent per year.|$|R
50|$|The {{administration}} of the <b>cheque</b> <b>account</b> was restricted by building society rules {{and the need to}} find a partner that could clear Abbey's cheques (The Co-operative Bank). Later, Abbey became a full member of the Bankers' Automated Clearing Services (BACS) and the former Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS). Thornton also acted to break the building societies' interest rate consensus.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, Abbey National {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for innovation and, sometimes disruptive, change. It was an early user of computer systems and in the late 1970s, all branches became on-line to a real-time system that maintained customer accounts. Under Chief general manager Clive Thornton, new types of savings accounts were introduced {{as well as a}} <b>cheque</b> <b>account.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the car on}} the way {{to their}} first gig, Murray gets a call from his wife Shelley. They had been {{separated}} but are back together now. Bret learns from his phone conversation that the 'emergency fund' came from their joint <b>cheque</b> <b>account,</b> and that Murray hadn't told his wife that he had taken it to use for the tour. They also find out that Mel and Doug have been following their car.|$|E
5000|$|Though many {{debit cards}} are drawn against <b>chequing</b> <b>accounts,</b> direct deposit and point-of-purchase {{electronic}} payments are cleared through networks {{separate from the}} cheque clearing system (specifically the Federal Reserve's Automated Clearing House and the private Electronic Payments Network.) ...|$|R
50|$|Historically, checks {{have been}} one of the primary means of payment for {{purchasing}} goods and services in the U.S. In 2001, <b>cheques</b> <b>accounted</b> for 25 percent of the U.S.-based payment mix; in 2006, this is projected at 17 percent.|$|R
50|$|In North America, {{overdraft}} {{protection is}} an optional feature of a <b>chequing</b> <b>account.</b> An account holder may either {{apply for a}} permanent one, or the financial institution may, at its discretion, provide a temporary overdraft on an ad hoc basis.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{bookkeeping}} {{record in}} single-entry bookkeeping is the cash book, {{which is similar}} to a checking account (UK: <b>cheque</b> <b>account,</b> current account) register, but allocates the income and expenses to various income and expense accounts. Separate account records are maintained for petty cash, accounts payable and receivable, and other relevant transactions such as inventory and travel expenses. These days, single-entry bookkeeping can be done with DIY bookkeeping software to speed up manual calculations.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1868 the Council {{declared}} {{all positions}} vacant. Hughes did not apply for his old job, and the newly appointed City Treasurer Thomas Worsnop was deputised to take on his duties pro tem. This voluntary resignation {{came as a surprise}} to many, but then the truth came to light, largely due to the conscientiousness of mayor Fuller, that Hughes had been in 1866 and 1867 embezzling Council funds by clever manipulation of the <b>cheque</b> <b>account,</b> which could only be detected by careful comparison of the amount withdrawn and that written on the chequebook stubs. The truth came to light through Hughes's method of repaying the defalcations; by destroying cheques and paying creditors cash out of his own pocket. Hughes was tried, convicted and sentenced to eight years' jail with hard labour.|$|E
40|$|MBA - WBSIncreased {{retention}} {{of its customers}} increases a bank’s market share and can {{have a significant impact}} on profits (Reichheld and Sasser 1990). Many customer satisfaction studies have shown clear links between customer satisfaction, customer loyalty and customer retention. Although customer satisfaction is seen as the main driver for customer retention, the objective of this research was to identify the underlying factors that influence a customer to close his or her account and move to another bank. The methodology used was quantitative, with questionnaires made available on the Internet. A sample of 290 respondents who possess a <b>cheque</b> <b>account</b> at a bank in South Africa was used. A snowballing sampling technique was used to be able to achieve the sample size required. The study found service elements to be the main drivers for customer retention in South African retail banks, but did, however, find that the product itself factored together with service elements, suggesting that in the banking industry the boundaries between the product and service becomes blurred. The second and third factors indicated the need for convenience, whether online or through other channels, and should be taken into account in all service delivery plans. The key message and conclusion of the research is that the product and the service offering from the bank are interlinked and should not be seen as separate offerings to customers. The study may be of value to other service related companie...|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} {{individuals}} see debits and credits {{in the above}} manner, is that the bank statement presented by the bank to the customer is the bank's view of the account. The bank views money in a <b>chequing</b> <b>account</b> as money the bank owes to the customer, i.e. a liability, and in the rules of accounting, an increase to a liability account is a credit. Likewise, when a bank lends money to a customer and places the money into the customer's <b>chequing</b> <b>account,</b> the bank has increased its obligation to pay that money, which is a liability, and this increase is a credit and appears in the credit column of a bank statement.|$|R
50|$|Namibian banks offer {{wide variety}} of {{products}} like Savings <b>Accounts,</b> <b>Cheque</b> <b>Accounts,</b> Transmission Accounts, Investment Accounts, Credit Cards Accounts and many types of Loan Accounts (Vehicle Loan, Mortgage/Housing Loan, Personal Loan etc.) to meet its customer requirements. The money in Savings & Investment accounts earns interest, while no interest is paid for <b>cheque</b> and transmission <b>accounts.</b> The credit balance in credit card account also earn interests. Most of the accounts are subjected to monthly account fees and Credit Card accounts are subjected to annual fees. There is no reward / loyalty program for using credit card in Namibia.|$|R
50|$|Debit {{cards are}} {{accepted}} {{in a relatively}} larger amount of stores, {{both large and small}} in Spain. Banks often offer debit cards for small fees in connection with a <b>chequing</b> <b>account.</b> These cards are used more often than credit cards at ATMs because it is a cheaper alternative.|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 1950 s Swedish {{commercial}} banks started to offer payroll services to employers and open current accounts with chequebooks for both white- and blue-collar employees. Within a decade Swedish wage earners were turned into bank customers and the commercial banks – formerly solemn institutions serving {{business and the}} very richest – became retail companies selling {{a wide range of}} products to a broad public. The paper investigates, through the case of so-called <b>cheque</b> <b>account</b> salaries, the cultural challenges posed by the exceptionally early bancarisation (spread of the use of banking services) in Swedish society. I argue against over-emphasising the individual self-governing financial subjects depicted in Foulcauldian studies of the financialisation process. The making and control of new financial subjects in Sweden was made possible, at least during its first phase, by technologies and discourses rooted in a more directly disciplinary and hierarchical value system impregnated by class (as defined by production rather than consumption). Collective affiliations of groups of employees, building on wage earner identities, rather than on consumer identities, proved to be instrumental in the financialisation of everyday life. The new everyday consumers of financial products were created in a back and forth movement between the older subject positions and the models imagined for the new. Furthermore, my study demonstrates that the prevalent chronology of the financialisation of daily life in Europe can be traced further back in time...|$|E

Money Transfer Services (MTS) were introduced in February 1969, and all branches of the trading banks were converted to computer processing by November 1969. In 1974/75 <b>chequing</b> <b>accounts</b> were introduced by the Post Office Savings Bank and several trustee savings banks.|$|R

50|$|With the {{loosening}} {{of regulations}} on banking in the 1970s, the Bank's position was sufficiently sound {{for it to}} take maximum advantage of its new found freedom. In 1975, Taranaki Savings Bank was the first bank to offer free, interest-bearing <b>cheque</b> <b>accounts</b> and in 1981 the bank pioneered New Zealand's ATM Cashflow network with one ATM installed {{in each of the}} Hawera, Fitzroy, New Plymouth City and New Plymouth City Centre (now TSB Centre) branches.|$|R
5000|$|An {{advantage}} to the drawer of using cheques instead of debit card transactions, is that they know the drawer's bank will not release the money until several days later. Paying with a cheque and making a deposit before it clears the drawer's bank is called [...] "kiting" [...] or [...] "floating" [...] and is generally illegal in the US, but rarely enforced unless the drawer uses multiple <b>chequing</b> <b>accounts</b> with multiple institutions to increase the delay or to steal the funds.|$|R
50|$|On August 5, 2009, {{the bank}} {{announced}} that it would focus its operations on Visa card services and foreign exchange services for non-retail members, and was leaving the personal banking marketplace. The bank became a non-deposit-taking bank and entered into an agreement to sell its residential mortgages, personal loans and real estate secured lines of credit to Toronto-Dominion Bank. Savings and <b>chequing</b> <b>accounts</b> of B.C. customers were transferred to Vancity in B.C., or to another financial institution of their choice. Customers outside of B.C. had to transfer their accounts to other financial institutions.|$|R
50|$|It {{is common}} for the terms and {{conditions}} of <b>chequing</b> <b>accounts</b> to state that postdated cheques should not be written and will be dishonoured if detected. In some instances a postdated cheque may be retained by the bank and paid on the due date if that date {{is only a few}} days away. Some UK organisations do not accept post-dated cheques as well as some Government Departments, while paying income tax or voluntary National Insurance may only be done with post-dated cheques with permission from HM Revenue and Customs.|$|R
