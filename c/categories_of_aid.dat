40|$|There are 3 major {{views on}} the {{effectiveness}} of foreign aid. First, foreign aid is perceived as positive in terms of its effect on growth. Second, foreign aid is effective when certain conditions (e. g. political conditions) are satisfied. Third, aid has neither significant impact nor has it positive returns on economic growth. A substantial part of foreign aid research has been focused on total amount of aid‘s effects on economic growth. To clarify all these issues, 7 major functional types of aid are examined (e. g. social services and infrastructure). From the methodology perspective, we use panel data techniques such as the fixed effects, random effects and system GMM. For describing economic development, we use the proxies of ‗PQLI (Physical Quality of Life Index), ‘ HDI (Human Development Index), infant mortality rate, age dependency ratio, adult literacy rate, as well as GDP growth, and others. All these variables are used as dependent variables to judge aid‘s effectiveness. Concerning the independent variables, we use a variety of them as per literature and the 7 <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> As a result of this analysis all <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> affect our dependent variables in different ways. Two important consequences can be drawn from our study. First, our paper confirms the positive impact of foreign aid on economic development as many other researchers have been pointed and contrary to those who have suggested a negative impact of foreign aid.

40|$|Purpose – South Asia {{has been}} an {{important}} destination <b>of</b> foreign <b>aid</b> over the past decades. Since a large part <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> is disbursed for social and economic infrastructure development in South Asian countries, and the volume <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> has tremendously increased in recent years, {{the purpose of this study}} is to investigate how far various <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>aid</b> affects economic growth rate in these countries. In addition, as the trend <b>of</b> each <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> transfer appears to have been volatile, this study also investigates whether the volatilities inhibit growth rate in these countries. Design/methodology/approach – In this study, South Asia refers to India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The Random effects approach is employed incorporating panel data for the period of 1995 - 2008. The aggregate foreign aid is classified into various categories to have a comprehensive investigation. Findings – Foreign aid positively associated with growth whereas the volatility <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> hurts it. Long-impact aid promotes growth more than short-impact aid does. The volatility <b>of</b> short-impact <b>aid</b> hurts growth, whereas the volatility <b>of</b> long-impact <b>aid</b> has no effect on it. Pure aid and its volatility have no effect on growth. Originality/value – This study has identified the structure <b>of</b> foreign <b>aid</b> disbursed in these countries, and explored how far each category and respective volatility affects growth. These findings would be useful to the scholars and policy makers in the recipient countries as well as donors, to make foreign aid much more effective in future.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Many {{reports have}} {{established}} that hearing-impaired children using the Nucleus 22 -channel cochlear implant may show both significant benefits to lipreading and significant scores on open-set words and sentences using electrical stimulation only. These findings have {{raised questions about}} whether severely or severely-to-profoundly deaf children should be candidates for cochlear implants. To study this question, postoperative results for implanted children with different levels of preoperative residual hearing were evaluated in terms of speech perception benefits. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A retrospective study of the first 117 children, sequentially, to undergo implantation in the Melbourne and Sydney Cochlear Implant Clinics was undertaken. All children had been assessed by and received their implants in a tertiary referral centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To assess aided residual hearing, the children were grouped into four <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> hearing on the basis <b>of</b> their <b>aided</b> residual hearing thresholds measured preoperatively. To assess benefits, the scores of children on standard speech perception tests were reviewed. As different tests were used for children with different ages and language skills, children were grouped into categories according {{to the level of}} postoperative speech perception benefit. RESULTS: The results showed that children in the higher <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>aided</b> preoperative residual hearing showed significant scores on open-set word and sentence perception tests using the implant alone. For children in lower <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>aided</b> residual hearing, results were variable within the groups. More than 90 % of children with implants with aided residual hearing thresholds in the speech range above 1 kHz achieved open-set understanding of words and sentences. CONCLUSION: While the results of this preliminary study confirm previous findings of differential outcomes for children with different levels of preoperative residual hearing, they suggest that children with severe to profound hearing impairments should be considered for cochlear implantation.

40|$|Summary Although {{the concept}} <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> for trade has quickly gained {{prominence}} among aid donors {{as well as}} aid recipients, relatively {{little is known about}} its impact on trade-related performance. We use data on a large subset of developing countries for recent years to examine the extent to which various types <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> for trade have helped recipient countries' trade performance. We find that aid for trade facilitation reduces the costs <b>of</b> trading. Moreover <b>aid</b> for trade has an overall positive and significant impact on exports. This effect is entirely driven by aid to economic infrastructure, while the other main <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> for trade, aid to productive capacity, has no discernible effect on exports. Its strong positive association with exports at the sectoral level is due to an allocation skewed toward already well performing sectors. aid for trade aid effectiveness trade cost of trading exports...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{uses the}} fiscal {{response}} framework {{to investigate the}} extent to which different categories of foreign aid flows, namely project aid, programme aid, technical assistance and food aid, displace public savings and affect the recipient country's dependence on aid, using time series data for Cote d'Ivoire for the period 1975 - 99. The results indicate that, in general, project aid flows tend to reduce public savings and worsen Cote d'Ivoire's dependence on aid more than the other <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> flows. This finding therefore suggests that accounting for aid heterogeneity in aid studies as well as aid policies design and implementation could be crucial in improving aid effectiveness to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. ...|$|E
30|$|Finally, another {{specific}} mechanism {{through which}} aid might influence self-selection is by modifying incentives to migrate via income. It is however {{still not clear}} what is the efficiency of aggregate aid in sustaining growth (see Rajan and Subramanian, 2008). Some authors have presented evidence showing that <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> related to the support of development exert {{a positive effect on}} growth, see Clemens et al. (2004), Gomanee et al. (2005), Minoiu and Reddy (2010). As a consequence assuming that aid targeted exclusively to promote development is supporting growth, contributing to financing the gross national income in recipient countries and thus increasing wages, aid might (dis)incentive new emigrants. For testing the effect of developmental aid on migration selection we use many proxies.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the link between}} foreign aid and the composition of government spending in aid-recipient countries. Two questions are addressed: (i) does foreign aid crowd out government spending in aid-recipient countries, and (ii) does the degree of fungibility vary across different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid?</b> Using a panel dataset of 67 countries for 1972 - 2000 we find that at the aggregate level about 70 percent of total aid is fungible. We also find that aid targeted for public investment crowds out about 80 - 90 percent of domestic government spending on public investment. Aid does not affect private investment, but has a strong positive impact on household consumption. The results are also robust to checks for causality. These findings are significant, since {{more than two-thirds of}} all aid flows to developing countries are tied to public investment projects...|$|E

This leads to a reduction in domestic productive public spending and completely offsets any positive impact that aid might have on growth.

An alternative approach is to seek a reference point external to the entire FCAS category – for example a multilateral initiative – which allows us to explore systematic differences between those who sign up and those who do not. This research took the UN’s Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) initiative as such a mechanism. Splitting FCAS into two groups – those who had joined SUN within its initial two-year phase and those who had not – we reviewed a range of social, economic, political, institutional and conflict/instability indicators to identify areas of significant difference. An unexpected finding was that while SUN-joiners performed statistically better on governance, {{there was no difference between}} joiners and non-joiners on the level of instability and violence they suffered, suggesting that some countries, even at high levels of conflict disruption, can achieve areas of relatively good governance...|$|R
