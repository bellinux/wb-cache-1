40|$|Summary Several {{proposals}} {{for a test}} procedure for neck injury protection assessment have been published. A good deal of data are available {{to serve as a}} basis for the choice of; test set-up (e. g. full vehicle test, sled test), accident severity (delta-v, acceleration characteristic) and crash dummy type. There is however a lack of information regarding the choice of a neck injury criterion and a tolerance level. There are however promising activities under way, for instance in the ongoing EU-project "Whiplash II". The EEVC ad-hoc working group on whiplash injuries recommends that a new EEVC activity on rear impact is established. Although much research work has taken place there are still significant gaps in the knowledge base, before a full regulatory test procedures can be fully adopted. The ad-hoc group feels that a new EEVC activity would have an important role to play in initiating and evaluating new research to fill these gaps.

To be taken into account here are the judicial framework (a) and the rights of the offender (the right to challenge the alleged violation, application of the owner onus principle...). The technical dimension also includes a financial characteristic (b). The detection system may be based on a self-financing policy (cost recovery system in Great-Britain until 2006) or on a direct financing by the authorities. This characteristic also raises the issue of the how the accrued revenue is to be used, which depends among other things on the constraints of public finance laws or on the existence of a no-fault accident system as it is operated in Victoria (Australia) or in New Zealand for instance. The lessons drawn from the economic analysis of illegal acts, which shows that the level of deterrence hinges on a combination of effects associated with the intensiveness of surveillance and the severity of the sanction stresses the importance to define an optimal deterrent policy (c) [3, 13]. Thus the ASE systems can be characterized by different combinations of surveillance and sanction. It is also crucial that the scale of penalties and the modalities of the sanctions are taken into account, as they affect the functioning of the whole system (fines and/or demerit point system 3...). The technical dimension also includes the installation <b>criteria</b> (<b>d)</b> for the detection devices (abnormal driving speed level, black spot...).

Such inter-connected objects {{are referred to as}} Internet-of-Things (IoT) and/or Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). One example of such a system is based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The fleet of such vehicles are prophesied to take on multiple roles involving mundane to high-sensitive, such as, prompt pizza or shopping deliveries to your homes to battlefield deployment for reconnaissance and combat missions. Drones, as we refer to UAVs in this paper, either can operate individually (solo missions) or part of a fleet (group missions), with and without constant connection with the base station. The base station acts as the command centre to manage the activities of the drones. However, an independent, localised and effective fleet control is required, potentially based on swarm intelligence, for the reasons: 1) {{increase in the number of}} drone fleets, 2) number of drones in a fleet might be multiple of tens, 3) time-criticality in making decisions by such fleets in the wild, 4) potential communication congestions/lag, and 5) in some cases working in challenging terrains that hinders or mandates-limited communication with control centre (i. e., operations spanning long period of times or military usage of such fleets in enemy territory).

However, TID is multi-componential, requiring the recognition of immediate and prospective performance. The measurement of athletic movement skill may afford practitioners insight into the latter component given its augmented relationship with functional sport specific qualities. It is currently unknown whether athletic movement skill is a discriminant quality in junior Australian football (AF). This study aimed to discriminate talent identified junior AF players from their non-talent identified counterparts using a fundamental gross athletic movement assessment. From a total of 50 under 18 (U 18) AF players; two groups were classified a priori based on selection level; talent identified (n = 25; state academy representatives) and non-talent identified (n = 25; state-based competition representatives). Players performed a fundamental gross athletic movement assessment based on the Athletic Ability Assessment (AAA), consisting of an overhead squat, double lunge (left and right legs), single leg Romanian deadlift (left and right legs), and a push up (six movement criterions). Movements were scored across three assessment points using a three-point scale (resulting in a possible score of nine for each movement).
