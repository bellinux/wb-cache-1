40|$|ABSTRACT. The lateral {{distribution}} uniformity {{produced by}} several commercially available anhydrous ammonia (NH 3) manifold configurations was determined using a dynamic water absorption technique. For a conventional <b>cast</b> <b>manifold,</b> {{top and bottom}} inlet configurations were compared, as were open versus restricted manifold outlet barbs. Coefficient of variation for lateral distribution (lateral CVs) ranged from 15 to 20 % for the top inlet and from 8 to 10 % for the bottom inlet. For the conventional manifold, the use of open [(5. 6 mm ID (0. 22 in. ID) ] versus restrictor–type hose barbs [2. 4 mm ID (0. 09 in. ID) ] had little influence on lateral distribution. The Continental vertical dam manifold produced lateral CVs ranging from 10 to 13 %. For both manifolds, the influence of unequal discharge hose lengths was reduced as manifold pressure increased...|$|E

50|$|It has an {{aluminum}} engine block and aluminum DOHC cylinder heads. The cylinders {{are lined with}} cast iron. It uses SFI fuel injection, has 4 valves per cylinder and features fracture-split forged powder metal connecting rods and an assembled <b>cast</b> aluminum intake <b>manifold.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like the 1UZ-FE it has {{aluminum}} DOHC cylinder heads, MFI fuel injection, 4 valves per cylinder with bucket tappets, {{one-piece cast}} camshafts, and a <b>cast</b> aluminum intake <b>manifold.</b> For 2010, it {{was replaced by}} the 1UR-FE or 3UR-FE, depending on the country.|$|R
50|$|F22A6: 140 hp (104.40 kW) @ 5600 rpm. The F22A6 is {{the same}} as the F22A1 except for a {{slightly}} more aggressive camshaft, a better flowing <b>cast</b> exhaust <b>manifold,</b> a different more aggressively tuned ECU (PT6), and a different intake manifold that utilizes IAB's and also has a bigger plenum. The F22A6 also has a windage tray in the oil pan, and stiffer valve springs to accommodate the more aggressive camshaft. In cars with an automatic transmission there is an oil cooler present on the back of the block as well.|$|R
50|$|In September 1989 the Series II of the VN Commodore was {{released}} with the EV6 engine. Some {{of the changes}} included a new <b>cast</b> exhaust <b>manifold,</b> new camshaft sprocket profile and timing chain, improved air and fuel distribution to combustion chamber, recalibrated ignition and injector firing within the engine management computer, wider conrod bearings and revised throttle uptake. The automatic transmission was also recalibrated to match the new engines torque characteristics. These revisions helped reduce initial torque levels whilst also improving the noise and vibration levels of the V6 engine.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{auxiliary}} engine parts specific to the TR7 Sprint, and not used on the Dolomite Sprint engine: the <b>cast</b> steel exhaust <b>manifold</b> (RKC2788), the front pipe of the exhaust system (which has been remanufactured, RB7385), and a water transfer plate {{at the back of the}} cylinder head (also remanufactured, RB7240).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the application and lessons learned using the Shape Optimization capabilities in MSC/NASTRAN to analytically modify the existing {{design of a}} <b>cast</b> turbine <b>manifold.</b> Figure 1 shows {{a model of a}} typical cross section of the manifold. The objective of the analysis was to minimize weight while satisfying several load conditions as well as manufacturing and assembly constraints. Using MSC/PATRAN, a solid finite element wedge model of the cross section of the manifold was created. Basis vectors were generated with the analytical boundary method and used as shape design variables. The approach and results are discussed, as well as recommendations for future production use of the optimization capability. ...|$|R
50|$|The 1MZ-FE with VVT-i {{is used in}} the Avalon, Highlander, Sienna and Camry. Output is 210 hp (156 kW) at 5800 rpm with 222 lb·ft (328 N·m) {{of torque}} at 4400 rpm. Early {{versions}} of the VVT-i 1MZ used a dual throttle body, <b>cast</b> aluminum intake <b>manifold,</b> and EGR block off plates on the exhaust manifolds. Later versions used a drive-by-wire/electronic throttle control.|$|R
50|$|Regardless of the {{negative}} attributes focused upon by potential sellers of steel tube exhaust outlet configurations, engineers who design engine components choose conventional <b>cast</b> iron exhaust <b>manifolds</b> can similarly list positive attributes, such as an array of heat management properties and superior longevity than {{any other type of}} exhaust outlet design. For the average consumer, having trouble with an exhaust outlet system may qualify as 'poorer performance'.|$|R
50|$|Attached to the {{cylinder}} head is a cast aluminium alloy intake manifold on one side, and two <b>cast</b> iron exhaust <b>manifolds</b> {{on the same}} side (it's a non cross flow engine) (one manifold for three cylinders) followed by a two in one exhaust pipe system. The fuel system uses a Bosch mechanical distributor-type (Bosch VE type) injection pump which feeds indirect fuel injection into a remote whirl pre-combustion chamber.|$|R
50|$|One unusual {{feature of}} the ISB {{is that it is}} a {{multi-valve}} pushrod engine design. The engine displaces , with a 102.0 mm cylinder bore and 120.0 mm piston stroke. A turbocharger is used to increase the output in the high-compression (17.2:1 in recent versions) diesel. It is an all-iron engine with forged steel connecting rods, an assembled camshaft, and a <b>cast</b> aluminum intake <b>manifold.</b> The engine is produced in Columbus, Indiana.|$|R
50|$|The Type 73C used a new 1.5 L (1488 cc/90 in³) straight-4 engine with 4 valves per {{cylinder}} and a twin overhead camshaft. This was a {{new design}} with a 76 mm bore and 95 mm stroke, wet cylinder liners, a detachable cylinder head, and a single <b>cast</b> iron exhaust <b>manifold.</b> Much {{to the chagrin of}} Bugatti purists, the Type 73 used off-the-shelf hex fasteners rather than the custom-designed parts used in all previous cars.|$|R
40|$|The {{highlights}} {{of this report}} are: (1) fly ash classified by less than 100 microns in size was mixed into a 300 lb melt of alloy 535 without the need of a magnesium additive; (2) a vibratory feeder fitted with a sieve {{was used as the}} means to minimize particle clustering while introducing fly ash into the aluminum alloy 535 melt; and (3) the industrial-size field test was successful in that sand mold castings and permanent mold castings of tensile bars, K mold bars, and ingots were made from aluminum alloy 535 -fly ash mix. Use of aluminum alloy 535 containing 7 % magnesium precluded the need to introduce additional magnesium into the melt. The third round of sand mold castings as well as permanent mold castings produced components and ingots of alloy 535 instead of alloy 356. The ingots will be remelted and cast into parts to assess the improvement of flyash distribution which occurs through reheating and the solidification wetting process. Microstructure analysis continues on sand and permanent mold castings to study particle distribution in the components. A prototype sand <b>cast</b> intake <b>manifold</b> <b>casting</b> was found to be pressure tight which is a major performance requirement for this part. Another heat of pressure die cast brackets of A 380 -classified fly ash will be made to examine their strength and fly ash distribution. Ingots of A 356 -fly ash have been made at Eck for remelting at Thompson Aluminum for squeeze casting into motor mounts...|$|R
40|$|To {{eliminate}} the shrinkage porosity in {{low pressure casting}} of an A 356 aluminum alloy intake <b>manifold</b> <b>casting,</b> numerical simulation on filling and solidification processes of the casting was carried out using the ProCAST software. The gating system of the casting is optimized according to the simulation results. Results show that when the gating system consists of only one sprue, the filling of the molten metal is not stable; and the casting does not follow the sequence solidification, and many shrinkage porosities are observed through the casting. After the gating system is improved by adding one runner and two in-gates, the filling time is prolonged from 4. 0 s to 4. 5 s, the filling of molten metal becomes stable, but this casting does not follow the sequence solidification either. Some shrinkage porosity is also observed in the hot spots of the casting. When the gating system was further improved by adding risers and chill to the hot spots of the casting, the shrinkage porosity defects were eliminated completely. Finally, by using the optimized gating system the A 356 aluminum alloy intake <b>manifold</b> <b>casting</b> with integrated shape and smooth surface as well as dense microstructure was successfully produced...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cast</b> iron exhaust <b>manifolds,</b> less {{restrictive}} than units found on previous engines, were {{bolted to the}} outboard side of each head. The new cylinder heads also featured stud-mounted rocker arms, a change from the shaft-mounted LA arms. This last change {{was due to the}} different oiling system of the new engine, as described in the next paragraph. The valve covers on the Magnum have 10 bolts rather than the previous 5, for improved oil sealing. In addition, the valve covers were made of thicker steel than earlier parts, and were installed with a silicone gasket.|$|R
50|$|The 4G69 is a 2378 cc version {{built in}} Shiga, Japan. Bore is 87 mm and stroke is 100 mm. Output is 162 hp (120 kW) at 5750 rpm (160 in the Sportback Wagon) with 162 lb·ft (219 N·m) of torque at 3500 rpm. It has a cast iron engine block and an {{aluminum}} SOHC cylinder head. It uses multi-point fuel injection, has 4 valves per cylinder with roller followers and features forged steel connecting rods, a one-piece cast camshaft, and a <b>cast</b> aluminum intake <b>manifold.</b> The 4G69 incorporates Mitsubishi's MIVEC Variable Valve Timing technology.|$|R
5000|$|The Hemi is also {{available}} in a [...] version.

50|$|This was {{the first}} engine in this family, {{featuring}} a Lotus-developed 16-valve cylinder head and a cast-iron cylinder block which was {{essentially the same as}} in Opel's 8-valve engines. C16XE was available only in Corsa GSi, model years 1993 and 1994. C16XE was not yet badged Ecotec, and for later model Corsas and Opel Tigras it was replaced with X16XE Ecotec engine. The main difference between C16XE and X16XE Ecotec is emission control, C16XE lacks EGR and AIR-system, although the cylinder head is designed to enable these features. Other differences between C16XE and later versions of the engine include intake manifold, C16XE has a plastic upper intake manifold, which was replaced with a <b>cast</b> aluminium <b>manifold,</b> and fuel injection system, C16XE uses Multec fuel injection with MAF sensor and later models used Multec fuel injection with MAP sensor. Also, while C16XE had its own exhaust front section design, for X16XE it was replaced with a front section used also in Opel Astra, probably as a cost-saving measure.|$|R
5000|$|The Magnum SOHC version, code ECH, {{develops}} [...] SAE (111 kW) at 6500 rpm, and 135 lb·ft (184 N·m) {{of torque}} at 4800 rpm. Chief differences between this version and the A588 include a cast aluminum SOHC cylinder head that more easily passes exhaust gases than the base engine, a camshaft that is optimized for higher engine speeds, a factory welded exhaust short-tube header {{instead of a}} <b>cast</b> exhaust <b>manifold,</b> and a two-piece intake manifold. This manifold features unequal-length intake runners that are switched by an electric actuator that controls butterfly-type valves in the shorter intake runners. The longer runners are always open, and provide a mild supercharging effect due to their length between 3000 rpm and 4800 rpm. The shorter runners, open from 4800 rpm to redline at wide-open throttle, also provide a tuned resonance effect due to their length. The shorter runners are also opened at wide-open throttle below 3000 rpm to provide an intake path to each cylinder that is as free-flowing as possible.|$|R

5000|$|... 1992 {{introduced}} {{a new version of}} the 4.3L, the L35. This version of the 4.3L was equipped with CPI (Central Port Fuel Injection). This system had one centrally located fuel injector to distribute fuel to six hoses each with a poppet valve to each of the intake ports. This system allowed for a multi-point injection, using one injector. The fuel injection was a batch fire system and used a two piece <b>cast</b> aluminum dual-plenum <b>manifold.</b> This engine was available in Chevrolet S-10 Pickups Chevrolet Cheyenne C-1500 pickups and S10 Blazer/S15-Jimmys SUVs, Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari vans only.

5000|$|A torque-biased {{variant of}} the Coyote is {{produced}} {{as an alternative to}} the EcoBoost V6 in the new F-150 pickup truck. The F150 5.0L receives a lower compression ratio (10.5:1), intake camshafts with less duration, <b>cast</b> iron exhaust <b>manifolds,</b> and revised cylinder heads. The intake manifold changed only in color, with no change in size or shape. These changes promote low-end and mid-range power and torque. The engine retains the Coyote's forged steel crank and piston-cooling jets but benefits from the addition of an external engine oil cooler similar to the Boss 302's. The changes result in the engine's peak horsepower dropping to [...] at 5750 rpm, while torque is rated at 387 lbft Nm at 3850 rpm.|$|R
