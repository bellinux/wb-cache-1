40|$|Geothermal {{heat pumps}} {{represent}} an interesting {{technology that is}} expected to contribute significantly to the reduction of primary energy use for <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>and</b> meet the targets set by the European Union. Additional benefits of this technology are related to the integration with discontinuous energy resources, in particular wind, combining <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> power. The replacement of conventional heating systems such as boilers, with heat pump systems allows the de-localization of emissions of micropollutants from urban centers to the sites in which thermal power stations are operating. This also enhances emissions monitoring and control. Furthermore, the use of distributed production systems based on the use of renewable sources reduces also CO 2 emissions. (Lo Russo et al., 2011) In this general context, the increasing implementation in several areas of the world of the open-loop groundwater heat pumps technology which discharge into the aquifer for <b>cooling</b> <b>and</b> <b>heating</b> buildings could potentially cause, even in the short term, a significant environmental impact associated with thermal interference with groundwater, particularly in the shallow aquifers. The discharge of water at different temperatures compared to baseline (warmer in summer and colder in winter) poses a number of problems in relation to the potential functionality of many existing situations of use of the groundwater (drinking water wells, agricultural, industrial, etc.). In addition, there may be cases of interference between systems, especially in the more densely urbanized. This means that the alteration of the temperature of the groundwater determined by a plant may affect the installations located downstream, with significant alterations of the performances of the systems themselves. These issues highlight how it is crucial for the compatible development of the technology of groundwater heat pumps discharging into aquifers that it shall be a fair assessment and technically effective both for <b>cooling</b> <b>and</b> <b>heating</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> pumping and injection systems in ground. The current legislation related to withdrawals and discharges into aquifers design a framework suitable for the protection of groundwater and permit to decide the 3 best configuration of the plant with a case by case approach. Appropriate specialized hydrogeological investigations should be performed for the characterization of the main hydrogeological parameters of the subsoil at the considered site. In this thesis some important aspects related to the development of open-loop heat pumps have been explored in a typical urban contest (Torino city, NW Italy). The results of the work have allowed to define several fundamental aspects in order to optimize the design choices of GroundWater Heat Pump (GWHP) systems. After a general description of the low enthalpy geothermal heat pumps technologies (Chapter 1), the analysis and comparison of the current hydrogeology problems in urban area are described, considering the impact of groundwater heat pump system in a urban contest (Chapter 2). Urban and industrial development can impose major stresses on groundwater resources. The conceptual model for the groundwater flow system, the schematization of the aquifer boundaries and the estimation of basic hydrogeological parameters are among the main issues which should be investigated in the development of open-loop <b>heat</b> pumps <b>plants.</b> In particular, some characteristics of urban elements require particular attention if compared to less anthropized areas. In Chapter 3 the geological and hydro-stratigraphical characteristics of the Torino test site have been described. This chapter includes a complete description of the GWHP system plant and monitoring system that has been installed in the Politecnico di Torino and the illustration of the fundamentals of the numerical modelling we performed using a specific comme...|$|R

A district energy system as defined for the Stamford {{project is the}} production of chilled and hot water at a central energy plant, and its distribution underground to participating building in the vicinity. The objective {{of the study was}} to investigate implementation of a district energy system in conjunction with cogeneration as a means to encourage energy conservation and provide the city with an economic development tool. Analysis of the system configuration focused on selecting an arrangement which offered a realistic opportunity for implementation. Three main alternatives were investigated: (1) construction of an 82 MW cogeneration plant and a district heating and cooling system to serve downtown buildings, (2) construction of a small (4 MW) in-fence cogeneration plant combined with cooling and heating, and (3) construction of a district <b>cooling</b> <b>and</b> <b>heating</b> <b>plant</b> to supply selected buildings. Option (1) was determined to be unfeasible at this time due to low electricity prices. The analysis demonstrated that alternatives (2) and (3) were feasible.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} in buildings {{is responsible for}} 26 % of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions (CSIRO, 2010). Furthermore the energy consumption associated with <b>cooling</b> <b>and</b> <b>heating</b> <b>plant</b> in buildings typically accounts for over 50 % of the total building energy use (CSIRO, 2010). As a result this project assesses the greenhouse gas emissions associated with possible air conditioning upgrade alternatives for a multi-storied building 295 Ann Street, Brisbane. 295 Ann Street, Brisbane was constructed in 1973 making the mechanical services plant approximately 38 years old. Due to the age and condition of the air conditioning plant the system is due for replacement. The aims of the project are to analyse, compare and contrast various air conditioning upgrade alternatives to determine which will provide the greatest greenhouse gas emissions savings. A BCA 2010 reference building will be modeled for each alternative {{to determine if the}} existing system or proposed upgrades are compliant with the Building Code of Australia. Using the TRACE 700 Load and Energy Analysis Software the upgrade alternatives and reference buildings were modeled. It was identified that significant greenhouse gas emissions savings can be achieved by upgrading the buildings mechanical services.

40|$|This project {{addressed}} {{two significant}} deficiencies in air-handling systems for large commercial building: duct leakage and duct static pressure reset. Both constitute significant energy reduction opportunities for these buildings. The overall project {{goal is to}} bridge the gaps in current duct performance modeling capabilities, and to expand our understanding of air-handling system performance in California large commercial buildings. The purpose of this project is to provide technical support {{for the implementation of}} a duct leakage modeling capability in EnergyPlus, to demonstrate the capabilities of the new model, and to carry out analyses of field measurements intended to demonstrate the energy saving potential of the SAV with InCITeTM duct static pressure reset (SPR) technology. A new duct leakage model has been successfully implemented in EnergyPlus, which will enable simulation users to assess the impacts of leakage on whole-building energy use and operation in a coupled manner. This feature also provides a foundation to support code change proposals and compliance analyses related to Title 24 where duct leakage is an issue. Our example simulations continue to show that leaky ducts substantially increase fan power: 10 percent upstream and 10 percent downstream leakage increases supply fan power 30 percent on average compared to a tight duct system (2. 5 percent upstream and 2. 5 percent downstream leakage). Much of this increase is related to the upstream leakage rather than to the downstream leakage. This does not mean, however, that downstream leakage is unimportant. Our simulations also demonstrate that ceiling heat transfer is a significant effect that needs to be included when assessing the impacts of duct leakage in large commercial buildings. This is not particularly surprising, given that ?ceiling regain? issues have already been included in residential analyses as long as a decade ago (e. g., ASHRAE Standard 152); mainstream simulation programs that are used for large commercial building energy analyses have not had this capability until now. Our analyses of data that we collected during our 2005 tests of the SAV with InCITeTM duct static pressure reset technology show that this technology can substantially reduce fan power (in this case, by about 25 to 30 percent). Tempering this assessment, however, is that cooling and heating coil loads were observed to increase or decrease significantly depending on the time window used. Their impact on <b>cooling</b> <b>and</b> <b>heating</b> <b>plant</b> power needs to be addressed in future studies; without translating the coil loads to plant equipment energy use, {{it is not possible to}} judge the net impact of this SPR technology on whole-building energy use. If all of the loads had decreased, such a step would not be as necessary...|$|E
