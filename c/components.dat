5|$|As well {{as being}} added, forces can also be {{resolved}} into independent <b>components</b> {{at right angles to}} each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into <b>components</b> of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal <b>components,</b> the <b>components</b> of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the <b>components</b> of the individual vectors. Orthogonal <b>components</b> are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is {{in the same direction as}} one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike <b>components</b> toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground {{reaction}} forces with both horizontal and vertical <b>components.</b> The vertical <b>components</b> mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal <b>components,</b> due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E
