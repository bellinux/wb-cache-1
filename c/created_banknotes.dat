25|$|Initially, {{paper money}} was {{designed}} abroad, and printed using simple methods. Later, more advanced techniques were used, <b>creating</b> <b>banknotes</b> which reflected stability. After the war, {{in parallel with}} their loss in value, the quality of banknotes decreased. Finally, not even serial numbers were printed on the notes.|$|R
2500|$|Renminbi {{currency}} {{production is}} carried out by a state owned corporation, China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation (CBPMC; [...] ) headquartered in Beijing. CBPMC uses several printing, engraving and minting facilities {{around the country to}} produce banknotes and coins for subsequent distribution. Banknote printing facilities are based in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Xi'an, Shijiazhuang, and Nanchang. Mints are located in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Shenyang. Also, high grade paper for the banknotes is produced at two facilities in Baoding and Kunshan. The Baoding facility is the largest facility in the world dedicated to developing banknote material according to its website. In addition, the People's Bank of China has its own printing technology research division that researches new techniques for <b>creating</b> <b>banknotes</b> and making counterfeiting more difficult.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design process}} for this series began in 1963 with a {{primary goal of}} <b>creating</b> <b>banknotes</b> that were more counterfeit-resistant than the 1954 Series it was to replace. The Bank of Canada {{requested}} design submissions from security printing companies, receiving several from both domestic and foreign companies. One proposed design was received from Organisation Giori, a Swiss security printer based in Lausanne that had developed a multicolour printing press [...] "that raised the bar on banknote security". Its designs for the $10 and $20 banknotes were a [...] "significant departure" [...] from traditional Canadian banknote designs by incorporating more colours, new graphic elements, and different security features, but the design was rejected. Final conceptual designs were created by Canadian Bank Note Company, British American Bank Note Company, and De La Rue, the latter being the first foreign firm involved {{in the design of}} Canadian banknotes. The design by De La Rue was selected by the Bank of Canada in 1964 {{as the basis for the}} new series.|$|R
25|$|In 1910 the Tibetan {{government}} started {{producing a}} large range of copper and silver coins of different denominations, and in 1918 to 1921, gold coins were struck. Tibetan banknotes were first issued in 1913. From 1955 to 1959 no more Tibetan coins were <b>created,</b> although <b>banknotes</b> {{were still being}} printed, and by 1959 {{all of the money}} was gradually being replaced with renminbi yuan (the official currency of the People's Republic of China).|$|R
2500|$|The Series A Banknotes (...) were {{introduced}} by the Irish Free State in 1928 and were the first <b>banknotes</b> <b>created</b> by and for the state; the series continued to be issued when the Free State became Ireland. The notes served from 1928 to 1977 and were replaced by Series B notes.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, {{high-quality}} counterfeits of the $10 banknote {{appeared in}} circulation in Ontario and Quebec. In May 2006, Peel Regional Police in the Greater Toronto Area seized $50,000 worth of $20 and $50 counterfeit banknotes and received {{assistance from the}} Integrated Counterfeit Enforcement Teams division of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police {{to search for the}} production plant, which had <b>created</b> counterfeit <b>banknotes</b> with a total face value over $1,000,000. In the spring of 2008, a batch of counterfeit $100 appeared in the Greater Toronto Area. Reaching a peak distribution there in May, similar forgeries were later found in the Montreal area, with its peak distribution in June.|$|R
5000|$|Military payment certificates, or MPC, {{was a form}} of {{currency}} used to pay U.S. military personnel in certain foreign countries. It was used in one area or another from {{a few months after the}} end of World War II until a few months after the end of U.S. participation in the Vietnam War - from 1946 until 1973. MPC utilized layers of line lithography to <b>create</b> colorful <b>banknotes</b> that could be produced cheaply. Fifteen series of MPCs were created. However, only 13 series were issued. The remaining two were largely destroyed, although some examples remain. [...] Among the 13 released series a total of 94 notes are recognized.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cylinder}} scene {{engraved on}} the first 25,000 pistols was <b>created</b> by <b>banknote</b> engraver Waterman Ormsby. The image was his fourth and last to be featured on Colt revolvers. The overall scene is 1 1/16 inch wide by 3 1/4 inch long. At {{one end of the}} scene is the text, [...] "COLT'S PATENT No. 14705". The image contains a pioneer defending himself against an attack by six Indians in Seminole-style attire using a pair of revolver pistols while (assumedly) his wife and child are escaping. Along the top of the scene (the edge of the cylinder which is closest to the pistol barrel) is a [...] "finely detailed wavy line and dot border".|$|R
50|$|In March 1917, Narbut {{moved to}} Kiev. In September 1917, he became {{professor}} and rector of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts. During {{this time he}} <b>created</b> his Ukrainian <b>banknotes,</b> postage stamps and charters for the newly created Ukrainian National Republic. Narbut also worked on the Ukrainian magazines: Nashe Mynule (Our past), Zori (Stars), and Sontse Truda (The Sun of Work) among others. He died of typhus in 1920.|$|R
5000|$|Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was re-elected in 2011, by 54% of {{the vote}} in a general election. After it, the {{government}} instituted a period of fiscal austerity which has severely impacted the economy. Inflation increased to more than 25% annually, but the income tax was not adjusted accordingly, which led to a demonstration by unionist Hugo Moyano. The government imposed arbitrary trade barriers and forbade the acquisition of foreign currency, generating a black market in it. As the government denies the inflation through the manipulation of the INDEC statistics, huge amounts of $100 banknotes, the largest denomination in circulation, were printed, instead of <b>creating</b> a <b>banknote</b> of a higher value. This renewed the Boudougate, a political controversy involving the vice president Amado Boudou and the printing house appointed to print the banknotes.|$|R
2500|$|Unofficial [...] "Makedonka" [...] {{souvenir}} <b>banknotes,</b> <b>created</b> by nationalist {{organizations in}} the Republic of Macedonia, depicted the White Tower of Thessaloniki, {{in spite of the}} tower being located in the Greek region of Macedonia and not in the Republic of Macedonia. VMRO-DPMNE {{went so far as to}} propose the White Tower-depicting banknote's official adoption. However, the government in Skopje rejected its official use and adopted a different design for the new Macedonian denar, which was issued in 1992.|$|R
5000|$|Colonial German East Africa was cut {{off from}} Germany {{resulting}} from a wartime blockade. Silver coinage was hoarded for its intrinsic value in commercial transactions, and the colonial government was pressured into <b>creating</b> interim <b>banknotes.</b> Previous issues of banknotes (i.e., 1905 and 1912) were produced by the German printing company Giesecke & Devrient. The colonial government contracted with the printers of Deutsch-Ostafrikanische Zeitung, a daily newspaper in Dar es Salaam, and on 15 March 1915 they produced {{the first issue of}} provisional notes (20 rupien), initially printed on linen and later on paper made from jute. Given the wartime supply shortages, the provisional notes were also printed on commercial paper, wrapping paper, and in one very rare instance, wall paper. Initially variations of white, the notes also appeared {{in a wide variety of}} colors, including blue-gray, olive brown, reddish brown, golden brown, dark brown, gray brown, shades of blue, and dark green.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1964, his 1,000-yen note partial reproductions became {{noticed by}} the police and he was indicted for <b>creating</b> imitations of <b>banknotes,</b> in {{violation}} of the 1894 Law Controlling the Imitation of Currency and Securities. The language of the law was quite vague, prohibiting any manufacture or sale of objects with an exterior front that may “be confused for currency or securities”. In August 1966, he went on trial for what was dubbed the [...] "Thousand-Yen Bill Incident". In June 1967, he was found guilty with a three-month suspended sentence. He appealed twice. The decision was upheld in 1970.|$|R
500|$|The situado was {{discontinued}} {{during the}} 19th century, creating [...] an economic crisis, {{as a result}} of Mexico gaining its independence from Spain. Salvador Meléndez Bruna, the colonial governor in office, ordered the issue of provincial <b>banknotes,</b> <b>creating</b> the Puerto Rican peso. However, printing of these banknotes ceased after 1815. During the following decades, foreign coins became the widespread currency. In the 1860s and 1870s, banknotes reemerged. On February 1, 1890, the Banco Español de Puerto Rico was inaugurated and began issuing banknotes. The bank designed four series and placed three in circulation under Spanish rule. In 1895, a Royal Decree ordered the production of provincial peso coins.|$|R
50|$|At the bank, {{there is}} a record of all the polarizations and the {{corresponding}} serial numbers. On the bank note, the serial number is printed, but the polarizations are kept secret. Thus, whilst the bank can always verify the polarizations by measuring the polarization of each photon in the correct basis without introducing any disturbance, a would-be counterfeiter ignorant of the bases cannot create {{a copy of the}} photon polarization states, since even if he knows the two bases, if he chooses the wrong one to measure a photon, it will change the polarization of the photon in the trap, and the forged <b>banknote</b> <b>created</b> will be with this wrong polarization.|$|R

25|$|The {{banknote}} {{was unveiled}} and released into circulation {{at a national}} ceremony at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, and also at several regional events, on 7 November 2012. On 9 September 2016, the Bank of Canada released {{a modified version of}} the banknote to commemorate Elizabeth II becoming the longest-reigning monarch of the United Kingdom and Canada. It is derived from the standard $20 Frontier Series banknote, but replaces the images on the metallic foil with the royal cypher of Elizabeth II and a portrait of Elizabeth II adapted from a 1951 photograph by Yousuf Karsh. It was the first Canadian banknote to depict Elizabeth II wearing a tiara. This portrait was also used for the obverse of all banknotes of the 1954 Series, including both variants of the Centennial $1 banknote issued in 1967 for the Canadian Centennial, but the engraving <b>created</b> for those <b>banknotes</b> excluded the tiara.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} ways in which the {{classical}} gold standard established the foundations for a modern international monetary system with its distinctive forms of crisis and regulatory frameworks. The specific nature of this transformation is often overlooked because of a tendency in the literature to compare the gold standard in relation to subsequent monetary systems, such as Bretton Woods. To remedy this historical bias, the classical gold standard is compared with previous monetary systems and it is concluded that it contributed to expand the array of monetary instruments for conducting monetary policy. By progressively subjecting the management of fiduciary money to state control the institutions of the gold standard created a new monetary framework that opened the way for central banking. However, the commitments taken to this effect, such as provisions on the convertibility of <b>banknotes,</b> <b>created</b> new opportunities for speculation. I argue that this new weakness would become the main preoccupation of monetary policy in the 20 th century and lay down the foundations for international cooperation and its novel emphasis on monetary stability...|$|R
