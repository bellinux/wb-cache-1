30|$|Two {{additional}} characteristics concerned each study's participants. First, we categorized studies {{based on}} the age of participants: children and adolescents (k = 6) or adults (k = 21). We suspected that intervention outcomes might vary {{as a function of}} age, perhaps because of differences in cognitive and socioemotional maturity across development. Second, we classified studies {{based on the}} population from which participants were recruited. Most studies (k = 17) included participants recruited from psychiatric clinics, hospitals, or other at-risk settings (e.g., youths in residential treatment, support groups for survivors of incest). Other studies (k = 10) included participants recruited from schools, colleges, or the community (e.g., introductory psychology students, community members recruited <b>through</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>advertisements).</b>|$|R

There is a paucity of information linking sources of pet acquisition with subsequent euthanasia, which may inform evidence-based strategies to reduce euthanasia rates.

Methods: Data for 5391 dogs and 5581 cats surrendered to one Queensland shelter between January 2006 and December 2009 were analysed. Results: The main sources of acquisition for owner-surrendered dogs were ‘shelter’ and ‘pet shop’ and for owner-surrendered cats were ‘own litter’ and ‘shelter’. Euthanasia rates for different sources varied. For adult dogs, acquisition <b>through</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>advertisements</b> was associated with the highest euthanasia rate.

Thirty-seven male and 32 female regular Electronic Gaming Machine (EGM) players were recruited <b>through</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>advertisements.</b> Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} either: (1) a control condition, or (2) an experimental condition that introduced a loud white-noise event (80 db) at fixed 120 s intervals throughout the 5 -min EGM gambling session. Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) measurements showed that the manipulation was successful in elevating autonomic arousal. The results showed differences in behavioral response to the manipulation based on prior experience with gambling problems. Persons with many gambling problems had lower average bet-sizes in the white-noise condition compared to the control, while those with few or no problems had higher average bet-sizes. The results suggest that arousal may provide different signals to gamblers with few versus many problems. Gamblers with many problems may interpret their arousal as a sign that they will soon lose money, while gamblers with few or no problems may associate feelings of arousal exclusively with winning...|$|R

50|$|Today {{there are}} a number of Sami who seek to return to the {{traditional}} Pagan values of their ancestors. There are also some Sami who claim to be noaidi and offer their services <b>through</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>advertisements,</b> in New Age arrangements, or for tourist groups. While they practice a religion based on that of their ancestors, widespread anti-pagan prejudice has caused these shamans to be generally not viewed as part of an unbroken Sami religious tradition. Traditional Sámi beliefs are composed of three intertwining elements: animism, shamanism, and polytheism. Sámi animism is manifested in the Sámi's belief that all significant natural objects (such as animals, plants, rocks, etc.) possess a soul; and from a polytheistic perspective, traditional Sámi beliefs include a multitude of spirits. Many contemporary practitioners are compared to practitioners of neo-paganism, as a number of neopagan religions likewise combine elements of ancient pagan religions with more recent revisions or innovations, but others feel they are attempting to revive or reconstruct indigenous Sami religions as found in historic, folkloric sources and oral traditions.|$|R

This research aimed to identify factors related {{to the need for}} paramedic attendance, identify possible factors that complicate clinical management and explored opportunities to promote a positive birth experience. Methods: Women who were over the age of 18 years and who had birthed within the last 5 ye rs were recruited via social media and <b>through</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>advertisements.</b> Using narrative inquiry 20 women were interviewed in person, via phone or skype, depending on their location. Results: Mothers identified a need to avoid attending hospital too early for reasons such as a fear of being sent home or protecting themselves from obstetric interventions. Mothers reported feeling empowered, confident and exhilarated during the birth. However, mothers also identified concerns around privacy, communication, l ck of consent, feeling judged and issues with maternal and paternal bonding.

Serotonin 1 A autoreceptors, which inhibit serotonin synthesis and release, are downregulated in SAD, and serotonin transporter availability might be increased; however, presynaptic serotonin activity has not been evaluated extensively. OBJECTIVE To examine the serotonin synthesis rate and serotonin transporter availability in patients with SAD and healthy control individuals using positron emission tomography (PET) with the radioligands 5 -hydroxytryptophan labeled with carbon 11 ([11 C] 5 -HTP) and 11 C-labeled 3 -amino- 4 -(2 -dimethylaminomethylphenylsulfanyl) -benzonitrile [11 C]DASB.

Only 16% had a job offer in Ireland prior to arrival, about double the rate of Chinese respondents, but {{less than a third}} the rate of Indian or Lithuanian respondents.

Many work in personal services and childcare (positions such as care assistants, security guards, waiters, or hotel staff). This marked a significant shift from their previous pattern of employment in their home country, and has been interpreted as evidence of deskilling. About half of Nigerian men and two-thirds of Nigerian women feel that their qualifications are fully recognised in their main job. Compared to other groups they have an intermediate level of income (majority reporting between €14,401 and €31,720). Fewer than 2% are employed in predominantly Irish working environments.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background N-acetyl {{cysteine}} (NAC) is a glutathione precursor {{that has}} been shown to have antidepressant efficacy in a placebo-controlled trial. The current study aimed to investigate the maintenance effects of NAC following eight weeks of open-label treatment for bipolar disorder. Method The efficacy of a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial of 2 g/day NAC as adjunct maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder was examined. Participants (n = 149) had a Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Score of ≥ 12 at trial entry and, after eight weeks of open-label NAC treatment, were randomized to adjunctive NAC or placebo, in addition to treatment as usual. Participants (primarily outpatients) were recruited through public and private services and <b>through</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>advertisements.</b> Time to intervention for a mood episode was the primary endpoint of the study, and changes in mood symptoms, functionality and quality of life measures were secondary outcomes. Results There was a substantial decrease in symptoms during the eight-week open-label NAC treatment phase. During the subsequent double-blind phase, there was minimal further change in outcome measures with scores remaining low. Consequently, from this low plateau, between-group differences did not emerge on recurrence, clinical functioning or quality of life measures. Conclusions There were no significant between-group differences in recurrence or symptomatic outcomes during the maintenance phase of the trial; however, these findings may be confounded by limitations.
