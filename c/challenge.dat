30|$|For the {{agent-based}} thinking <b>challenges</b> (see Fig.  9), <b>challenges</b> {{went down}} with time in both the kinematics and ecology units. Since the kinematics models had single agents, the <b>challenges</b> related to agent-aggregate relationships did not occur in activities 1 – 4. Unlike the other three categories of <b>challenges,</b> the number of <b>challenges</b> did not increase in activity 4. This is possibly because activity 4 did not introduce any new agent-based-thinking-related <b>challenges.</b> However, the agent-based thinking <b>challenges</b> resurfaced in activity 5 when the students were required to model multiple new agents, and modeling multiple agents caused the number of <b>challenges</b> to increase sharply. Like other types of <b>challenges,</b> the students were also able to overcome most of these <b>challenges</b> by activities 6 and 7.|$|R

The perfect competition in the market posed many <b>challenges</b> to retailers for better organizational performance. In this study we attempt to identify items for retail <b>challenges</b> (RC) and organizational performance (OP) based on strong literature support in consultation of practitioners and consultants {{in the field of}} organized non-livestock retailing (NLR). The retail <b>challenges</b> so selected were classified with factor analysis using principal component analysis with varimax rotation. Here, the retail <b>challenges</b> are classified into four categories as: strategic <b>challenges,</b> environmental <b>challenges,</b> customer <b>challenges,</b> and supply chain (SC) <b>challenges.</b> The six identified items for organizational performance are: market performance, SC competencies, stakeholder satisfaction, innovation and learning, customer satisfaction, and financial performance. A confirmatory model was tested using structural equation modeling to prove hypotheses: strategic <b>challenges,</b> environmental <b>challenges,</b> and customer <b>challenges</b> influence SC <b>challenges</b> and all the <b>challenges</b> affect organizational performance. The data were collected from organized non-livestock retail players operating in north India. All the results are validated using rigorous statistical analysis...|$|R
