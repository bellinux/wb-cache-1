Additionally, we analysed the interaction between baseline fitness level and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> fitness. Methods: This is a 3 -year longitudinal study of 345 high school students aged 11 – 19 years. Students performed curl-ups, push-ups and 20 -m shuttle run tests from Fitnessgram. PA and ST were evaluated using a standard questionnaire. Standardized scores of fitness tests were summed. Changes over time were calculated as Δ 1 (2007 minus 2006), Δ 2 (2008 minus 2007) and Δ 3 (2008 minus 2006). Results: <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> PAI were positively and independently associated with <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> fitness in Δ 1, Δ 2 and Δ 3. <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> BMI were negatively associated with <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> fitness in Δ 3. Participants highly fit at baseline were those who showed positive <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> PAI over Δ 3, decreased <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> ST and had the lowest increase in BMI over 3 years compared with those low-fit at baseline. Conclusions: <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> BMI were associated with <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> fitness over 3 years.

The effect of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> challenge appraisal on depression was only direct and negative.
