The building <b>of</b> houses <b>of</b> <b>correction</b> came after {{the passing of}} an amendment to the Elizabethan Poor Law. However the houses <b>of</b> <b>correction</b> were not considered a part of the Elizabethan Poor Law system because the Act distinguished between settled poor and wandering poor.

30|$|Many {{operations}} to remedy hallux valgus are problematic {{as they do}} not provide a comprehensive solution for the deformity. Ideally, hallux valgus surgery comprises <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> the HVA and the 1 – 2.IMA, <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> a congruous 1.MTP joint with <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> sesamoid alignment, bunion excision, <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> a functional ROM of the 1.MTP, and maintenance of the normal weight-bearing mechanism of the foot [1]. Surgical interventions causing metatarsal shortening or dorsal deviation {{of the head of}} the first metatarsal, or with a high risk of avascular necrosis, probable failure at short-term follow-up, or the need to use foreign bodies, with the probability of local reactions, should be avoided.|$|R
40|$|Cataract {{extraction}} and the intraocular lens(IOL) implantation are {{the first}} choice to cure children cataract both domestic and overseas so far. However, IOL implantation {{in the eyes of}} children, especially in infant, has always been cared by ophthalmologists. Timely implanting IOL after the cataract extraction has {{played a significant role in}} terms <b>of</b> the refractive <b>correction,</b> the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> visual function, the prevention of amblyopia and the reconstruction of binocular vision. However, on the issue of IOL implantation after cataract extraction, there is always controversy on cataract treatment programs for children, and the focus of the controversy is when the IOL should be implanted. Theoretically, the principle of pediatric cataract surgery is the sooner the better, aiming to remove deprivation factor, open the visual pathway, implant IOL timely, and promote the visual development. How to find both “early” and safe IOL implantation time point is undoubtedly helpful for the rehabilitation of visual function of these children. The issues on the IOL implantation after children cataract extraction both at home and abroad are summarized below...|$|R
