5000|$|A cram down or <b>cramdown</b> is the {{involuntary}} imposition by a {{court of}} a reorganization plan over the objection of some classes of creditors.|$|E
5000|$|Till v. SCS Credit Corp., 541 U.S. 465 (2004), was a {{decision}} by the United States Supreme Court regarding a <b>cramdown</b> in the value of a loan during a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|If {{the judge}} approves the {{reorganization}} plan {{and if the}} creditors all agree the plan can be confirmed. If at least one class of creditors votes against the plan and thus objects, the plan may nonetheless be confirmed if the requirements of <b>cramdown</b> are met. In order to be confirmed over their objection the plan must not discriminate against that class of creditors, and the plan must be found fair and equitable to that class.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prohibition}} on <b>cramdowns</b> on {{loans secured by}} primary residences {{was the result of}} a political compromise during the process of enacting the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. At the time, Congress was confronted with brutal stagflation in which economic stagnation was combined with sky-high inflation and interest rates, which were severely frustrating the United States' long-term federal public policy of promoting homeownership (which goes back to the National Housing Act of 1934). Congress therefore decided to shield lenders on loans secured by primary residences from <b>cramdowns</b> because there was evidence that they perform [...] "a valuable social service" [...] through their loans.|$|R
5000|$|Under current United States law, {{bankruptcy}} {{courts are}} not allowed to perform <b>cramdowns</b> (i.e., reduce the principal amount or change the interest rate or other terms) on creditors who hold loans secured by mortgages on debtors' primary residences.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, under risk-based pricing, a {{rational}} lender will underwrite a loan {{with an interest}} rate that correlates directly to the borrower's credit risk. That is {{the risk that the}} lender cannot recover its entire expected return on investment, which in turn includes not only the probability of default, but also any external forces (like a bankruptcy court) that could delay repayment or force the lender to write off any part of the loan. The higher the risk, the higher the interest rate. Thus, Congress reasoned, if lenders knew their loans were protected from <b>cramdowns,</b> then they would offer loans at lower interest rates, which in turn would mean lower monthly payments, and thereby enable more Americans to afford homes. In plain English, Congress sacrificed the interests of the minority of borrower-homeowners who default on their loans for the sake of lowering the cost of homeownership for the majority of borrower-homeowners who successfully repay their loans.|$|R
5000|$|This {{rule was}} {{fiercely}} litigated in the 1980s, but the prohibitions on cramdowns on primary residences in both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings were eventually {{upheld by the}} U.S. Supreme Court in the early 1990s. [...] Finding no relief in Chapters 7 or 13, some individual borrowers tried the creative move of filing under Chapter 11 (which is normally used by corporations). As a result, the home lending industry went back to Congress, which responded by extending the <b>cramdown</b> restriction for loans secured by primary residences to Chapter 11 with the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{financial}} industry strongly voiced opposition to such a measure, claiming that it would create additional uncertainty as {{to the value of}} mortgage loans (and by extension, the collateralized debt obligations into which they are bundled). In addition, like in the late 1970s, {{the financial}} industry had powerful political leverage on its side: the risk that revoking the <b>cramdown</b> restriction would result in higher interest rates on home loans. It was impossible to simultaneously enact a law preventing the industry from jacking up interest rates on all home loans; that would have raised the possibility of bank runs, because few investors would keep their money at an institution that is legally prohibited from setting interest rates on its loans to accurately reflect the underlying credit risk. To prevent bank runs, Congress could have simultaneously imposed capital transfer restrictions, but that would have paralyzed the global economy. As few politicians wanted to be blamed by Wall Street for making homes unaffordable or causing even more bank failures or a second Great Depression, the proposals for revoking the prevention of cramdowns on loans secured by primary residences never found much traction in Congress.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{proposals}} to address housing market troubles through principal modification {{could increase the}} cost of credit in the mortgage market. We explore this possibility using historical variation in federal judicial rulings regarding whether Chapter 13 bankruptcy filers could reduce the principal owed on a home loan to the home’s market value. The practice, known as <b>cramdown,</b> was definitively prohibited by the Supreme Court in 1993. We find that home loans closed during the time when <b>cramdown</b> was allowed had interest rates 12 – 16 basis points higher than loans closed in the same state when <b>cramdown</b> was not allowed, which translates to a roughly 1 percent increase in monthly payments. Consistent with the theory that lenders are pricing {{in the risk of}} principal modification, interest rate increases are higher for the riskiest borrowers and zero for the least risky and higher in states where Chapter 13 filing is more common...|$|E
40|$|The {{story of}} 203 North LaSalle Street is archetypical {{of real estate}} {{investment}}s. A real estate investment partnership that had no other significant assets owned {{a substantial part of}} the 203 North LaSalle Street building, just as thousands of other real estate partnerships own thousands of other downtown office buildings across the United States. Like hundreds of other single asset real estate partnerships, the 203 North LaSalle Street Partnership fell upon financial hard times and filed a chapter 11 reorganization case to prevent the mortgagee from foreclosing on the building. As in many such cases, the financially decimated partners sought to retain their interests in the partnership in order to avoid breathtakingly large personal tax liabilities. The LaSalle partners expected to incur approximately twenty million dollars of personal tax obligations in the event of liquidation. The bankruptcy court, district court, and court of appeals allowed the partnership to retain ownership of the reorganized debtor under a “new value,” <b>cramdown</b> plan. The mortgagee, Bank of America, vigorously objected at every stage and asked the Supreme Court to grant certiorari to determine whether new value, <b>cramdown</b> plans of reorganization are permissible under the Bankruptcy Code...|$|E
40|$|The Chapter 11 {{bankruptcy}} process {{demands a}} careful balance between protecting the creditors’ rights to be repaid and allowing a failing entity {{the ability to}} restructure. The Supreme Court in RadLAX Gateway Hotel affirmed the Seventh Circuit’s holding in River Road and interpreted the Bankruptcy Code {{in a way that}} improperly shifts this balance towards the most senior creditors at the expense of business. This Note will analyze the circuit disagreement over the <b>cramdown</b> provision in the Bankruptcy Code and the Supreme Court’s ultimate resolution. It will argue that in light of recent trends in the credit markets - including highly liquid secondary markets for debt and aggressive lenders looking to speculate on restructuring businesses - the Supreme Court’s current interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code supports improper policy. It will also argue that consistent interpretation between two provisions in the Bankruptcy Code §§ 363 and 1129 (b), focusing on balancing the needs of debtors to restructure with the rights of creditors to be repaid suggests that the Supreme Court should have interpreted the <b>cramdown</b> provision to grant more flexibility in plan design. This Note argues that Congress, in light of the RadLAX decision, should amend the Bankruptcy Code to better suit the goals of the modern-day bankruptcy...|$|E
40|$|Professor Mark Scarberry has {{put forth}} a {{formidable}} critique of my empirical study of mortgage market sensitivity to bankruptcy modification risk. As this response shows, however, his critique does not hold up under scrutiny. Professor Scarberry argues that my study design is invalid because, as he reads {{the current state of}} the law, <b>cramdown</b> is virtually impossible. Therefore, he contends, we should not expect markets to exhibit sensitivity to <b>cramdown</b> risk, so no policy conclusions can be derived from my finding of market insensitivity. Regrettably, Professor Scarberry overreads the state of the law. The law is in fact unsettled, and that is all that is necessary to uphold the validity of my study’s design because the market can be expected to price for uncertainty about the law, and the absence of such a premium is significant. This response article also challenges Professor Scarberry’s contention that Chapter 13 relief should be limited lest it engender “resentment” of debtors. The article questions whether prevention of resentment even provides a sound basis for limiting bankruptcy relief, much less when relief would further an important macroeconomic goal of housing market stabilization. More broadly, the article takes issues with claims about the sanctity of secured credit. Debates about the efficiency of secured credit have all played out in the business context. In the consumer context, however, the inefficiency is manifest. Treating secured credit as inviolable would take us back to the unhappy future of Chapter XIII with higher costs for unsecured credit and the abusive consumer finance world of Williams v. Walker-Thomas...|$|E
40|$|On February 26, 2013, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in In re Village at Camp Bowie {{held that}} the Bankruptcy Code <b>cramdown</b> {{requirement}} in 11 U. S. C. § 1129 (a) (10) {{that at least one}} impaired class accept the reorganization plan did not distinguish between economic and discretionary impairment. Rejecting the Eighth Circuit’s holding that § 1129 (a) (10) included a motive inquiry, the Fifth Circuit instead held that no policy implications could be read into the plain language of the provision. This Comment argues that the Fifth Circuit correctly interpreted § 1129 (a) (10) as allowing artificial impairment, but missed the opportunity to influence other courts by not adequately supporting its conclusion with an analysis of the Bankruptcy Code’s structure or historical development...|$|E
40|$|Bankruptcy is {{the legal}} process whereby financially distressed firms, individuals, and {{occasionally}} governments resolve their debts. The bankruptcy process for firms plays {{a central role in}} economics, because competition drives inefficient firms out of business, thereby raising the average efficiency level of those remaining. The main economic function of corporate bankruptcy is to reduce the cost of default by having a government-sponsored procedure that resolves all debts simultaneously. The main economic function of personal bankruptcy is to provide partial consumption insurance to individual debtors and therefore reduce the social cost of debt. This chapter surveys theoretical and empirical research on both types of bankruptcy.

40|$|In 2003, over 1. 6 million {{consumers}} {{filed for}} bankruptcy protection, surpassing the previous record of 1. 5 million bankruptcy filings set just one year earlier. 1 In an effort to reverse the spiraling upward trend of consumer bankruptcies, and to prevent abusive debtors from using the bankruptcy system to avoid paying their debts, 2 in April, 2005, Congress voted overwhelmingly in favor of passing the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA). 3 Widely heralded as the most sweeping bankruptcy reform legislation in {{over a quarter of}} a century, 4 BAPCPA was designed in large part to force debtors with the ability to pay their debts out of Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy and into Chapter 13, the Bankruptcy Code 2 ̆ 7 s rehabilitation provision. 5 In addition, the Act sought to prevent certain abusive bankruptcy practices, such as the unfettered use of serial filings 6 and debtors 2 ̆ 7 abuse of Chapter 132 ̆ 7 s <b>cramdown</b> provisions to strip down secured debts incurred shortly before filing for bankruptcy protection...|$|E
40|$|This Article applies {{complex systems}} {{research}} methods {{to explore the}} characteristics of the bankruptcy legal system, presenting the results of an empirical study of twenty years of bankruptcy court valuation doctrine in business <b>cramdown</b> cases. These data provide solid descriptions of how courts exercise their discretion in valuing firms and assets. This Article accomplishes two objectives: First, using scientific methodology, this Article explains the content of bankruptcy valuation doctrine. Second, this Article uses doctrine as a variable to explore system dynamics that govern the processes of change over time. Significant findings include (i) courts tend to “split the difference” in valuations much less frequently than expected; (ii) parties’ valuation standards tend to be close together; (iii) bankruptcy courts’ valuation approach is substantially influenced by whether the valuation includes a calculation for the time value of money; (iv) {{there seems to be some}} geographic distribution of courts’ acceptance of valuation models, with Southern states more likely to accept “soft” valuation models, and non-Southern states more likely to accept “hard” valuation models; and (v) the evidence offers preliminary support for the hypothesis that bankruptcy system content may self-organize according to some complex deterministic dynamics...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{argues that}} courts {{overseeing}} chapter 11 {{cases have been}} mistakenly invoking the Supreme Court’s 2004 decision in Till v. SCS Credit Corp. —which specified a consumer-friendly formula for setting the interest rate on the remaining payments on a loan that financed a used pickup truck—at the expense of over a century of Supreme Court precedents that established the contrastingly creditor friendly “fair and equitable” standard for repayment of business debts, as well as disregarding a clear statutory distinction between the present value tests in chapters 11 and 13. This Article also discusses the controversial 2014 decision in Momentive Performance Materials and is particularly helpful {{in light of the}} recent publication by the ABI Commission to Study the Reform of Chapter 11 of its voluminous 2012 – 2014 Final Report and Recommendations. That Report concludes, with little explanation, that Till should not be applied in chapter 11 cases. This Article provides a detailed justification of that position, serving as a guide for judges who are tasked with analyses of chapter 11 <b>cramdown</b> interest rates and assisting those practitioners who would argue that application of the Till “prime-plus” formula violates existing “fair and equitable” jurisprudence. This Article also provides academics with additional historical and jurisprudential background concerning Till in the consumer bankruptcy context...|$|E
40|$|Government {{intervention}} in the bankruptcy reorganisation of listed companies in China constitutes a major obstacle to implement the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of the People’s Republic of China which was enacted in 2006 (2006 EBL). 1 The 2006 EBL improves upon its predecessor legislation—the 1986 EBL, which granted extensive powers to the Chinese government for its administrative control over the bankruptcy of enterprises, mainly state-owned enterprises. A new administrator mechanism has been established to replace the old liquidation group; {{the power of the}} creditors’ meeting has been strengthened and the creditors’ committee has been established in the 2006 EBL to better protect the interests of the creditors, which was intentionally ignored under the 1986 EBL; the people’s court obtained more powers in confirming the reorganisation plans by using its <b>cramdown</b> power and controlling the bankruptcy proceedings under the 2006 EBL. One of the goals of the lawmakers to improve these bankruptcy institutions is to reduce the government {{intervention in}} China and protect the interests of stakeholders. However, government intervention in fact renders these bankruptcy institutions weak and cannot function as expected by the lawmakers. This article argues that the government should return the powers to the bankruptcy institutions in order to let the bankruptcy system serve a better function in China’s market. This article is published in two parts. The first part discusses the negative effects of government intervention on bankruptcy institutions. The second part, appearing in the next issue, analyses the effects of the reorganisation on the listed companies exerted by the government. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} an economic analysis of insider guaranties in small business finance and bankruptcy, explaining {{their role in}} the panoply of legal and contractual devices used to control financial agency costs. It then uses this model to examine two areas of concern in the bankruptcy treatment of insider guaranties (the Deprizio preference problem and the enforceability of springing and exploding guaranties) and to explore some of the wider implications of insider guaranties for small business bankruptcy. Building on the fact that insider guaranties are typically used less to increase the assets available for repayment of the debt than to bond firm management to act {{in the best interest of}} the guarantied creditor, the article provides a new perspective on the insider preference dilemma, justifying the Deprizio doctrine (and critiquing amended Bankruptcy Code Section 550 (c)) by focusing on the positive effects of insider liability rather than the purported negative effects of creditor leverage. This same perspective, however, argues against the enforceability of springing guaranties, which create disproportionate and therefore inefficient incentives to avoid bankruptcy. The article also demonstrates that insider guaranties play several underappreciated roles in the functioning of small business bankruptcies. First, insider guaranties, by reducing the value of the <b>cramdown</b> threat, can significantly alter bargaining power within the bankruptcy case and may be partly responsible for the large number of small business bankruptcy failures. Second, chapter 11 provides an identical bankruptcy regime for small and large businesses, but this reorganization-focused system is inappropriate for many smaller firms. Insider guaranties may in part be a market-generated corrective, a means of resegmenting business bankruptcy into separate schemes for smaller versus larger firms...|$|E
40|$|Given {{the ongoing}} {{work on a}} {{multilateral}} restructuring process for sovereign debt in the UN, consideration of the content and implementation of a sovereign debt restructuring mechanism (SDRM) is timely. The framework {{and content of the}} SDRM proposed here differs from earlier proposals in several important respects. For the classification and supermajority voting of claims in the approval a restructuring plan, it would mimic the structure and operation of the model collective action clauses (Model CACs) proposed by the International Capital Markets Association. Restructuring under a qualified sovereign debt restructuring law (QSDRL) would be guided by four principles: (i) observe the KISS (keep it simple, stupid) principle, (ii) follow the Model CACs, (iii) limit the discretion of an administrator of a proceeding, and (iv) address only major current problems. A convention would oblige each adopting state to recognize and enforce a restructuring plan approved under a QSDRL of another adopting state. This obligation would be subject to exceptions along the lines of those under the New York Convention on arbitral awards. The QSDRL would employ novel methods of binding creditors under an approved restructuring plan. The convention would specify the requirements for a QSDRL while leaving implementing legislation to adopting states wishing to enact a QSDRL. A QSDRL would address many matters normally covered in an insolvency law, such as the requirements for approval of a plan. But it would not provide for the <b>cramdown</b> of dissenting classes of creditors, which would offend the norm of supermajority voting and require a tribunal with substantial discretion. It also would not provide for priority interim financing, as priority rules necessarily would offend the KISS principle and could be addressed outside the QSDRL. The proposed QSDRL would embrace a voluntary, contractual, and market-based approach—standards advocated by SDRM opponents such as the United States, the EU, and the IMF...|$|E
