During the period under review, the average international product prices of Petrol, Diesel and Illuminating Paraffin decreased. The average Rand/US Dollar exchange rate weakened {{when compared to the}} previous period. The average Rand/US Dollar exchange rate for the period 27 February 2009 to 26 March 2009 was 10,0655 compared to 10,0602 during the previous period. The Minister of Minerals and Energy has approved the implementation of a Single Maximum National Retail Price for Illuminating Paraffin with effect from 2 April 2003. The Single Maximum National Retail Price for Illuminating Paraffin will change on a monthly basis from the first Wednesday of each month and will also be promulgated in the Government Gazette. The Single Maximum National Retail Price with effect from 1 April 2009 to 5 May 2009 will be 581,0 c/l compared to 588,0 c/l from 4 March 2009 to 31 March 2009, that is a decrease of 7,00c/l. The Minister of Finance, in his Budget Speech on 11 February 2009, announced an increase of 23,0 c/l and 24,0 c/l in the fuel tax on petrol and diesel respectively with effect from 1 April 2009 and an increase of 17,5 c/l in the Road Accident Fund levy on petrol and diesel with effect from 1 April 2009. The maximum refinery gate price will be R4 738,06 per metric ton (262,96 c/l) for the period 1 April 2009 to 5 May 2009.

40|$|Objectives: Excessive fluid {{therapy in}} {{patients}} with sepsis {{may be associated with}} risks that outweigh any benefit. We investigated the possible influence of early fluid balance on outcome in a large international database of ICU patients with sepsis. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: Seven hundred and thirty ICUs in 84 countries. Patients: All adult patients admitted between May 8 and May 18, 2012, except admissions for routine postoperative surveillance. For this analysis, we included only the 1, 808 patients with an admission diagnosis of sepsis. Patients were stratified according to quartiles of <b>cumulative</b> fluid <b>balance</b> 24 hours and 3 days after ICU admission. Measurements and Main Results: ICU and hospital mortality rates were 27. 6 % and 37. 3 %, respectively. The <b>cumulative</b> fluid <b>balance</b> increased from 1, 217 mL (- 90 to 2, 783 mL) in the first 24 hours after ICU admission to 1, 794 mL (- 951 to 5, 108 mL) on day 3 and decreased thereafter. The cumulative fluid intake was similar in survivors and nonsurvivors, but fluid balance was less positive in survivors because of higher fluid output in these patients. Fluid balances became negative after the third ICU day in survivors but remained positive in nonsurvivors. After adjustment for possible confounders in multivariable analysis, the 24 -hour <b>cumulative</b> fluid <b>balance</b> was not associated with an increased hazard of 28 -day in-hospital death. However, there was a stepwise increase in the hazard of death with higher quartiles of 3 -day <b>cumulative</b> fluid <b>balance</b> in the whole population and after stratification according to the presence of septic shock. Conclusions: In this large cohort of patients with sepsis, higher <b>cumulative</b> fluid <b>balance</b> at day 3 but not in the first 24 hours after ICU admission was independently associated with an increase in the hazard of death.

40|$|Nitrogen balance during {{intermittent}} dialysis therapy of uremia. Daily {{measurements of}} nitrogen balance {{were made at}} two levels of protein intake in five patients undergoing chronic intermittent dialysis therapy. During ingestion of high (1. 4 g/kg of body wt) protein intake, nitrogen balance was positive on nondialysis days and negative on dialysis days, so that <b>cumulative</b> <b>balance</b> for the week of study was not different from zero. During ingestion of low (0. 5 g/kg) protein intake, nitrogen balance was approximately zero on nondialysis days but was again negative on dialysis days, so that <b>cumulative</b> <b>balance</b> for this period was negative. The negative nitrogen balance observed on dialysis days {{was associated with a}} higher rate of urea nitrogen generation (Gu, g/ 24 hr, determined by a kinetic model of urea nitrogen in dialysis patients) that was most evident in the hours immediately following dialysis. Net protein catabolic rate (PCR, g/ 24 hr), derived from total nitrogen mass balance equations, correlated very closely with Gu: Gu = 0. 154 PCR - 1. 7, r = 0. 96. This relationship agreed well with previous observations made in nondialyzed uremic patients under more steady-state conditions. These studies demonstrate that nitrogen balance is negative on dialysis days regardless of protein intake, and that Gu is higher on dialysis days. The negative nitrogen balance could result from amino acid loss in dialysate and from increased protein catabolism stimulated by loss of glucose into dialysate...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{questions}} still unanswered concerning the surge behavior of glaciersis their quasi-periodic occurrence. Some results {{on the influence of}} climate on surges of Variegated Glacier, Alaska, are discussed here. The main emphasis is put on the phenomenological connection between <b>cumulative</b> <b>balance</b> and surge initiation. Based on climate data from a neighboring weather station, a correlation betweenprecipitation, minimum temperature and local annual balance at a location in theaccumulation area is established for the period 1973 - 82. Additional data from two other weather stations make it possible to reconstructthe local annual balance back to 1905. The ice equivalent local <b>cumulative</b> <b>balance</b> between the last four surges in 1946 / 47, 1964 / 65, 1982 / 83 and 1994 / 95 is on average 43. 5 m, with a 1 σ-error of 1. 2 m. This surge level provides an explanation for the varying lengths of the surge intervals of Variegated Glacier. The initiation of a surge is determined by the accumulation of mass during the quiescent period prior to the surge, and thus by the average annual mass balancein the previous surge interval. This explanation for the length of the quiescent inverval cannot be directly interpreted in physical terms and the surge level can therefore not beused to explain the observed differences in surge intervals between different glaciers. The surge level is used to hindcast former unobserved surges, to compare the results with other surge datings obtained from photographs, and to establish a complete surge history for Variegated Glacier for the 20 th century...|$|E
40|$|By {{simulating}} {{the working}} of the unemployment insurance savings accounts (UISAs) in Slovenia using a methodology similar to Feldstein and Altman (1998), the paper examines two questions: how viable is this system {{as an alternative}} to traditional unemployment insurance (UI) system, and how the redistribution of income changes if the UI system is replaced by UISAs. The simulations are performed on a representative sample of labor force participants, for which lifetime labor market histories are generated from administrative panel data. Simulations show that the UISA system is a viable alternative to a modest UI system, but that its viability is jeopardized under generous benefits. Under the modest regime (here identified with a post- 1998 period, the period after the UI reform which strongly reduced the maximum potential duration of benefit, for most workers even by half) our calculations show that only one quarter of workers end their working life with negative <b>cumulative</b> <b>balance</b> and 43 percent ever experience a negative UISA balance; in contrast, under the generous regime (here identified with the pre- 1998 -reform period), 49 percent of workers end their working life with negative <b>cumulative</b> <b>balance</b> and 66 percent ever experience a negative balance. Moreover, under the modest benefit regime workers are better able to recover positive UISA balance. The simulations also show that the level of redistribution under the UISAs lags substantially behind the UI system, even though the version of the UISAs studied permits borrowing and hence allows for redistribution. unemployment insurance, unemployment insurance savings accounts...|$|E

Previously, a negative <b>cumulative</b> <b>balance</b> [8, 12, 13, 35, 36] and lower PVPI [22] on day 3 were correlated with better survival. The third day of shock seems to be a crucial turning point [37] at which homeostasis of cytokines is accompanied by the healing of microcirculatory disruptions and 'closure' of the capillary leak.

30|$|The {{idea behind}} PAL-treatment aiming for {{negative}} fluid balance {{in a setting}} of capillary leak {{is based on the}} recently rediscovered concept of the ebb and flow phase [2, 13, 28, 29].

Excess interstitial fluid leads to organ dysfunction [31], including ALI, secondary IAH [8], and associated acute kidney injury [32]. Shock reversal and subsequent hemodynamic and renal recovery sets in the transition to the flow phase resulting in mobilization of excess extravascular (lung) water [2]. Previously, a neutral to negative <b>cumulative</b> <b>balance</b> [1, 7, 10, 13, 33, 34] and reduction of EVLWI were shown to correlate with improved survival [15, 16, 18, 19].|$|E

This novel approach is beneficial in several ways. First, the new model can effectively incorporate shift and delay effects that may affect an activity. Second, it applies an exact interest calculation. Third, it can handle compounding in its accumulation. Finally, a comprehensive model is created that returns the <b>cumulative</b> <b>balance</b> including interest charges at all times.
