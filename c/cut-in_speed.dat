The nonlinear aerodynamics is calculated based on the dynamic stall model.

It is demonstrated that the harvester with double-plunge configuration outperforms its equivalent pitch–plunge counterpart in terms of both the power output and energy harvesting efficiency beyond the flutter boundary. In addition, case studies are performed to reduce the <b>cut-in</b> <b>speed</b> and to enhance the energy harvesting efficiency of the proposed harvester, including the airfoil mass characteristics, the configuration, mass, damping, and stiffness characteristics of the two plunge supporting devices, and the load resistances in the external circuits.

The mass of the first (windward) supporting device should be a bit smaller than that of the second one for an applicable <b>cut-in</b> <b>speed</b> and a high-energy harvesting efficiency. Besides, the decrease of airfoil mass moment of inertia or the damping of the supporting devices is shown to be beneficial for the energy harvesting performance.

The performance of such a wind turbine in Sri Lanka is not satisfactory, where the wind velocities are relatively low. This is due to low initial torque, which leads to difficulty in starting, as well as due to poor running efficiencies. This makes wind turbines less attractive for areas with low wind speeds. The main objectives of this study were to predict the performance of the existing NERDC wind turbine system and identity the main causes for its poor running performance at low wind speed and thereby design a rotor with improved performance. When improve the performance of the rotor to extract more energy from low wind-speeds, <b>cut-in</b> wind <b>speed</b> and design wind speed of wind turbine should be reduced.
