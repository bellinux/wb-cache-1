40|$|Abstract. Task {{parallelism}} is {{ubiquitous in}} modern applications for event-based, distributed, or reactive systems. In {{this type of}} programming, the ability to cancel a running task arises as a critical feature. Although {{there are a variety}} of cancellation techniques, a comprehensive account of their characteristics is missing. This paper provides a classification of task <b>cancellation</b> <b>patterns,</b> as well as a detailed analysis of their advantages and disadvantages. One promising approach is cooperative cancellation, where threads must be continuously prepared for external cancellation requests. Based on this pattern, we propose an extension of SCOOP, an object-oriented concurrency model. ...|$|R

Indeed, they capture the behaviour associated with non-local actions triggering, <b>cancellation</b> <b>patterns</b> and the advanced synchronisation that result. While, reactivity is guaranteed due to the real time massive cancellation semantics, based on the definition of new dynamic enabling rules and the definition of priority among executions, global synchronisation in turn is assured as a result of non-locality principle; an outcome of atomic stable transactions use. The operational semantics of TPNets is defined within rewriting logic-based framework...|$|R
40|$|Much {{has been}} made of the {{potential}} for hedging restrictions to reduce the value of executive stock options. We investigate this issue by comparing a rational utility-maximizing model that incorporates both hedging restrictions and an endogenous departure decision and a naïve value-maximizing model with an exogenous departure rate. While researchers mainly use these kinds of models to compute option values, we also use the models to generate forecasts of observable variables, the size and the timing of the payoffs of exercised options, and the annual rate at which options are canceled. We show that the naïve model provides just as good a description of actual exercise patterns of executives as the rational model in a sample of NYSE and AMEX firms. The more parsimonious naïve model may, there, be better for the purpose of valuation. The naïve incorporation of the exogenous departure rate in the standard America option model not only aligns predicted exercise and <b>cancellation</b> <b>patterns</b> with actual patterns, but also reduces option value by about a quarter. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{scientific}} computation {{continues to}} scale, {{it is crucial}} to use floating-point arithmetic processors as efficiently as possible. Lower precision allows streaming architectures to perform more operations per second and can reduce memory bandwidth pressure on all architectures. However, using a precision that is too low for a given algorithm and data set will result in inaccurate results. Thus, developers must balance speed and accuracy when choosing the floating-point precision of their subroutines and data structures. We are building tools to help developers learn about the runtime floating-point behavior of their programs, and to help them make decisions concerning the choice of precision in implementation. We propose a tool that performs automatic binary instrumentation of floating-point code to detect mathematical cancellations, as well as to automatically run calculations in alternate precisions. In particular, we show how our prototype can detect the variation in <b>cancellation</b> <b>patterns</b> for different pivoting strategies in Gaussian elimination, as well as how our prototype can detect a program’s sensitivity to ill-conditioned input sets. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to provide a basis on which stakeholders make their decisions, to improve System Dynamics (SD) modeling by deploying methods and techniques from system development, and to support in the creation of SD models where, static and dynamic methods are applied together to achieve a common goal. To achieve this we will take a stepwise approach: identify the key concepts as used in different methods, map their constructs, derive transformations, create their syntax and semantics, and develop requirements specifications on which a tool can be based. For Conceptual modeling we use Object-role modeling (ORM), a fact-oriented approach for modeling information at a conceptual level. For process modeling we use a technique (workflow language) called Yet Another Workflow Language (YAWL). YAWL works as an extension of Petri Nets with constructs to address the multiple instances, advanced synchronization and <b>cancellation</b> <b>patterns.</b> This research is under the supervision of Dr. S.

40|$|Objectives. Languages used {{to specify}} computer-interpretable {{guidelines}} (CIGs) {{differ in their}} approaches to addressing particular modeling challenges. The main goals of this article are: (1) to examine the expressive power of CIG modeling languages, and (2) to define the differences, from the control-flow perspective, between process languages in workflow management systems and modeling languages used to design clinical guidelines. Design. The pattern-based analysis was applied to guideline modeling languages Asbru, EON, GLIF, and PROforma. We focused on control-flow and left other perspectives out of consideration. Measurements. We evaluated the selected CIG modeling languages and identified their degree of support of 43 control-flow patterns. We used a set of explicitly defined evaluation criteria to determine whether each pattern is supported directly, indirectly, or not at all. Results. PROforma offers direct support for 22 of 43 patterns, Asbru 20, GLIF 17, and EON 11. All four directly support basic control-flow <b>patterns,</b> <b>cancellation</b> <b>patterns,</b> and some advance branching and synchronization patterns. None support multiple instances patterns. They offer varying levels of support for synchronizing merge patterns and state-based patterns. Some support a few scenarios {{not covered by the}} 43 control-flow patterns. Conclusion. CIG modeling languages are remarkably close to traditional workflow languages from the control-flow perspective, but cover many fewer workflow patterns. CIG languages offer some flexibility that supports modeling of complex decisions and provide ways for modeling some decisions not covered by workflow management systems. Workflow management systems may be suitable for clinical guideline applications...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} describes briefly how {{to translate}} certain workflow patterns into the simulation language Arena. The patterns used for translation {{are described in}} [1] and [2]. We refer to these references {{to learn more about}} workflow patterns. Because of the complexity of the simulation program Arena, we refer to [3] to learn more about Arena. This document is understandable without the use of books or websites, but a bit of experience with Arena would be preferable. Every modelling language has its own specific advantages and disadvantages. Arena has one major disadvantage when modelling workflow patterns; the way it deals with variables and attributes. The next chapter will give an explanation with an example to make this point clear. This document describes six groups of workflow patterns that have been translated. Each group consists of a certain number of patterns with an own specific behaviour. The six groups are: 1. Basic control patterns 2. Advanced branching and synchronization patterns 3. Structural Patterns 4. Patterns involving multiple instances 5. State-based <b>patterns</b> 6. <b>Cancellation</b> <b>patterns</b> For each workflow pattern a short description will be given. We used the Petri net notation to give an example of the patterns and refer to [2] for a flash animation of each pattern that shows the behaviour of each pattern in a very clear and understandable way. Finally each pattern will end with an explanation how to model the pattern in Arena. A short description will be given how the pattern can be modelled or why the patterns cannot be modelled in a straightforward manner in Arena. Then the graphical notation in Arena will be shown and tables with the settings for each building block will make this document reliable in a sense that it is repeatable. After the translation of the individual patterns, a real life case study will be modelled in Arena. The case study used, is described in [4, page 179]. The workflow and properties of the workflow including the resources will be given, and the direct translation of this workflow in Arena will be described. Finally a conclusion will be derived...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} develop {{precision}} vertex detectors for the future linear collider, fast active monolithic active pixel sensors are studied. Standard CMOS 0. 25 µm digital process is used to design a test chip which includes different pixel types, column-level discriminators and a digital control part. In-pixel amplification is implemented together with double sampling. Different charge-to-voltage conversion factors were obtained using amplifiers with different gains or diode sizes. Pixel architectures with DC and AC coupling to charge sensing element were proposed. As far, hits from conversion of 55 Fe photons were registered for the DC-coupled pixel. Double sampling is functional and allows almost a complete <b>cancellation</b> of fixed <b>pattern</b> noise. I...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the cultural configuration {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century leads to theconclusion that the dominant tendency is that of changing. The two forces in dispute are thetraditionalism and the modernism. The Romanian literary world is characterised by impurity. The reason is the fact that manyartistic forms that were already anachronistic in Occident, in Romania didn’t express all theirpotential and, on the other hand, we can detect, at the very beginning of the 20 th century, a newwave of confusion between the concepts of aesthetic, ethic and ethnic.

40|$|Abstract: We {{analyze the}} large N limit of adjoint QCD, an SU(N) gauge theory with Nf flavors of massless adjoint Majorana fermions, compactified on S 3 × S 1. We {{focus on the}} weakly-coupled {{confining}} small-S 3 regime. If the fermions are given periodic boundary conditions on S 1, we show that there are large cancellations between bosonic and fermionic contributions to the twisted partition function. These <b>cancellations</b> follow a <b>pattern</b> previ-ously seen {{in the context of}} misaligned supersymmetry, and lead to the absence of Hagedorn instabilities for any S 1 size L, even though the bosonic and fermionic densities of states both have Hagedorn growth. Adjoint QCD stays in the confining phase for any L ∼ N 0, explaining how it is able to enjoy large N volume independence for any L. The large N boson-fermion cancellations take place in a setting where adjoint QCD is manifestly non-supersymmetric at any finite N, and are consistent with the recent conjecture that adjoint QCD has emergent fermionic symmetries in the large N limit. ar X i...|$|R
40|$|The real {{projective}} plane {{has been}} formalized in Isabelle/HOL by Timothy Makarios [13] and in Coq by Nicolas Magaud, Julien Narboux and Pascal Schreck [12]. Some definitions {{on the real}} projective spaces were introduced early in the Mizar Mathematical Library by Wojciech Leonczuk [9], Krzysztof Prazmowski [10] and by Wojciech Skaba [18]. In this article, we check with the Mizar system [4], some properties on the determinants and the Grassmann-Plücker relation in rank 3 [2], [1], [7], [16], [17]. Then we show that the projective space induced (in the sense defined in [9]) by ℝ 3 is a projective plane (in the sense defined in [10]). Finally, in the real projective plane, we define the homography induced by a 3 -by- 3 invertible matrix and we show that the images of 3 collinear points are themselves collinear.

40|$|As a {{component}} of the collection development toolkit, citation analysis canyield data regarding use of library collections to guide and support selection decisions. Given current conflicting and increasing pressures on library collec-tion budgets, academic librarians with selection responsibilities may want to draw on tools such as citation analysis for help in making decisions about jour-nal acquisition, retention, cancellation, and provision of electronic access. Librarians with selection responsibilities in academic libraries often are liaisons to academic departments. A key role in liaison work is consultation with faculty regarding collection decisions. 1 Results of a citation analysis study can be a useful part of those faculty liaison conversations by offering data on journal use. Such data might help focus faculty comments when there is disagreement about proposed cancellations. 2 Additionally, data from citation analysis and other methodologies can provide documentation supporting selector decisions. This documentation may be requested to support fiscal and other types of accountability. A variety of tools are used in academic libraries to assess collection use. Circulation and shelving data, cost-per-use measures, interlibrary loan studies, reviews of core lists, citation analyses, and other methods are regularly employed. No one method will provide a full picture of collection use. Assessments that use several methods are likely to offer the most valid out-comes. 3 While high or low use of a journal may not necessarily dictate selection, retention, or <b>cancellation</b> decisions, use <b>patterns</b> do enable close examination of the subscription and associated costs.
