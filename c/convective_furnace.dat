40|$|Effects {{of rapid}} heat {{transfer}} using a fluidized bed on the heat-treating response of Al-Si-Mg alloys (both unmodified and Sr modified) were investigated. The heating {{rate in the}} fluidized bed is greater than in conventional air convective furnaces. Particle size analyses of eutectic Si showed that the high heating rate during fluidized bed solution heat treatment causes faster fragmentation and spherodization of Si particles compared to conventional air convective furnaces. The mechanism of Si fragmentation through fluidized bed processing is through both brittle fracture and neck formation and its propagation. In contrast to this, the mechanism of Si fragmentation using a conventional air <b>convective</b> <b>furnace</b> is through neck formation and propagation. The Sr-modified D 357 alloy showed a faster spherodizing rate than the unmodified alloy. Thermal analyses showed an exothermic reaction during solution heat treatment using a fluidized bed due to recrystallization, and coarsening of eutectic Al grains. Whereas the alloy solutionized using a conventional air <b>convective</b> <b>furnace</b> showed two exothermic reactions, one due to annihilation of point defects and the other due to recrystallization, and coarsening of the eutectic grains in the aluminum matrix. The recrystallization temperature of the alloy solutionized in the fluidized bed is lower {{than those in the}} conventional air <b>convective</b> <b>furnace.</b> Both tensile strength and elongation of fluidized bed solutionized alloys are greater than those solutionized using the air <b>convective</b> <b>furnace.</b> The optimum heat-treatment time for T 4 temper using a fluidized bed for unmodified and Sr-modified alloy was reduced to 60 and 30 minutes, respectively...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe current heat {{treatment}} processes {{make use of}} electricity or fuel for generating heat. Solar energy is available in abundance in the states of Rajasthan and Gujarat in India. Annual global solar radiation of about â‰¥ 2400 kWh/m 2 is received in these regions. Use of the abundant solar thermal energy in {{heat treatment}} of metals would saveenergy and fuels. In view of this a concept of solar <b>convective</b> <b>furnace</b> system is described in this paper. As a starting point, heat treatment of aluminium is considered. For this system, requirements of industrial furnace are taken as basis. A scale-down retrofitted furnace is designed and analysed. The importance of different process stages like, solar thermal energy absorption, storage and utilization in design of such a system is presented. A thermodynamic analysis is performed to derive requirements for the achievement of a uniform heating at a pre-determined rate. Control strategy {{to meet the requirements}} is worked out. Air flow profile in the furnace is analyzed using CFD as a tool. Laser Doppler Velocimetery technique is used for measurement of velocity in a Plexiglas model of the scale-down furnace. Flow analysis using theadopted CFD tool shows non uniformities in air flow profile. To counter this, further modifications and improvements in the furnace structure are suggested. Evaluation of Open Volumetric Air Receiver (OVAR) using installed solar air tower simulation facility is also presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop and validate mathematical models to characterize the thermal performance of a radiative shielded furnace, the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) Isothermal Diffusion Oven. The mathematical models are validated against experimental data obtained from testing the breadboard oven in a terrestrial laboratory environment. It is anticipated that the validation will produce math models capable of predicting the thermal performance of the furnace over a wide range of operating conditions, including those for which no experimental data is available. Of particular interest is the furnace core temperature versus heater power parametric and the transient thermal response of the furnace. Application to a microgravity environment is not considered, although it is conjectured that the removal of any gravity dependent terms from the math models developed for the terrestrial application should yield adequate results in a microgravity environment. The UAH Isothermal Diffusion Oven is designed to provide a thermal environment that is conducive to measuring the diffusion of high temperature liquid metals. In addition to achieving the temperatures required to melt a sample placed within the furnace, reducing or eliminating convective motions within the melt is an important design consideration [1]. Both of these influences are reflected {{in the design of the}} furnace. Reducing unwanted heat losses from the furnace is achieved through the use of low conductivity materials and reflective shielding. As evidenced by the highly conductive copper core used to house the sample within the <b>furnace,</b> <b>convective</b> motions can be greatly suppressed by providing an essentially uniform thermal environment. An oven of this design could ultimately be utilized in a microgravity environment, presumably as a experiment payload. Such an application precipitates other design requirements that limit the resources available to the furnace such as power, mass, volume, and possibly even time. Through the experimental and numerical results obtained, the power requirements and thermal response time of the breadboard furnace are quantified...|$|R
40|$|Trace {{amounts of}} mercury {{are found in}} all coals. During combustion, or during thermal {{treatment}} in advanced coal processes, this mercury is vaporized and can be released to the atmosphere with the ultimate combustion products. This has been {{a cause for concern}} for a number of years, and has resulted in a determination by the EPA to regulate and control these emissions. Present technology does not, however, provide inexpensive ways to capture or remove mercury. Mercury that exits the furnace in the oxidized form (HgCl{sub 2 }) is known to much more easily captured in existing pollution control equipment (e. g., wet scrubbers for SO{sub 2 }), principally due to its high solubility in water. Work funded by DOE has helped understand the chemical kinetic processes that lead to mercury oxidation in furnaces. The scenario is as follows. In the flame the mercury is quantitatively vaporized as elemental mercury. Also, the chlorine in the fuel is released as HCl. The direct reaction Hg+HCl is, however, far too slow to be of practical consequence in oxidation. The high temperature region does supports a small concentration of atomic chlorine. As the gases cool (either in the <b>furnace</b> <b>convective</b> passes, in the quench prior to cold gas cleanup, or within a sample probe), the decay in Cl atom is constrained by the slowness of the principal recombination reaction, Cl+Cl+M{yields}Cl{sub 2 }+M. This allows chlorine atom to hold a temporary, local superequilibrium concentration. Once the gases drop below about 550 C, the mercury equilibrium shifts to favor HgCl{sub 2 } over Hg, and this superequilibrium chlorine atom promotes oxidation via the fast reactions Hg+Cl+M{yields}HgCl+M, HgCl+Cl+M{yields}HgCl{sub 2 }+M, and HgCl+Cl{sub 2 }{yields}HgCl{sub 2 }+Cl. Thus, the high temperature region provides the Cl needed for the reaction, while the quench region allows the Cl to persist and oxidize the mercury in the absence of decomposition reactions that would destroy the HgCl{sub 2 }. Promoting mercury oxidation is one means of getting moderate-efficiency, 'free' mercury capture when wet gas cleanup systems are already in place. The chemical kinetic model we developed to describe the oxidation process suggests that in fuel lean gases, the introduction of trace amounts of H{sub 2 } within the quench region leads to higher Cl concentrations via chain branching. The amount of additive, and the temperature at the addition point are critical. We investigated this process in a high-temperature quartz flow reactor. The results do indicate a substantial amount of promotion of oxidation with the introduction of relatively small amounts of hydrogen at around 1000 K ({approx} 100 ppm relative to the furnace gas). In practical systems the source of this hydrogen {{is likely to be a}} small natural gas steam reformer. This would also produce CO, so co-injection of CO was also tested. The CO did not provide any additional promotion, and in some cases led to a reduction in oxidation. We also examined the influence of NO and SO{sub 2 } on the promotion process. We did not see any influence under the conditions examined. The present results were for a 0. 5 s, isothermal plug flow environment. The next step should be to determine the appropriate injection point for the hydrogen and the performance under realistic temperature quench conditions. This could be accomplished first by chemical kinetic modeling, and then by tunnel flow experiment...|$|R

The mercury that exits the furnace in the oxidized form (HgCl{sub 2 }) is known to much more easily captured in existing wet pollution control equipment (e. g., wet FGD for SO{sub 2 }), principally due to its high solubility in water. Until recently, however, nobody knew what caused this oxidation, or how to promote it. Recent DOE-funded research in our group, along with work by others, has identified the gas phase mechanism responsible for this oxidation. The scenario is as follows. In the flame the mercury is quantitatively vaporized as elemental mercury. Also, the chlorine in the fuel is released as HCl. The direct reaction Hg+HCl is, however, far too slow to be of practical consequence in oxidation. The high temperature region does supports a small concentration of atomic chlorine due to disassociation of HCl. As the gases cool (either in the <b>furnace</b> <b>convective</b> passes, in the quench prior to cold gas cleanup, or within a sample probe), the decay in Cl atom is constrained by the slowness of the principal recombination reaction, Cl+Cl+M {yields} Cl{sub 2 }+M.

Thus, the high temperature region provides the Cl needed for the reaction, while the quench region allows the Cl to persist and oxidize the mercury in the absence of decomposition reactions that would destroy the HgCl{sub 2 }. Promoting mercury oxidation is one means of getting high-efficiency, ''free'' mercury capture when wet gas cleanup systems are already in place. The chemical kinetic model we developed to describe the oxidation process suggests that oxidation can be promoted by introducing trace amounts of H{sub 2 } and/or CO within the quench region. The reaction of these fuels leads to free radicals that promote the selective conversion of HCl to Cl, which can then subsequently react with Hg. The work reported here from our Phase I Innovative Concept grant demonstrated this phenomenon, but it also showed that the process must be applied carefully to avoid promoting the recombination of Cl back to HCl. For example, addition of H{sub 2 } at too high a temperature is predicted to actually decrease Cl concentrations via Cl+H{sub 2 } {yields} HCl+H. At lower temperatures this reaction is slowed due to its activation energy. Thus, within the correct window, the process becomes selective for Cl promotion. Key parameters are the injection temperature of the promoter, the amount of the fuel added. A successful process based on this research will add a powerful tool to the mercury control arsenal. Presently, fractional oxidation in flue gases varies widely, but averages about 50 %. The amounts of promoter needed to obtain quantitative oxidation are predicted to be small ({approx} 50 ppm). The H{sub 2 }/CO could be supplied by conventional natural gas reformer on site, and the low expected fuel concentration would require only a relatively trivial amount of natural gas, even for a large power plant. For example, a 600 MW{sub e} plant would require the order of only 1 MW thermal equivalent of natural gas. If the mercury in the stream approaching a FGD system is highly oxidized, then high captures could be achieved without any additional cost, even for fuels of low chlorine...|$|R
