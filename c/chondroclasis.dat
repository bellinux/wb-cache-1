40|$|Abstract. Broiler {{chickens}} {{were started}} and maintained on rations containing 2 %, 5 %, and 10 % grain contaminated with Fusarium roseum. There was mortality of 75 % and loo%, respectively, in chicks fed 5 % and 10 % levels, and osteochondrosis {{was present in}} chicks which died at 12 to 17 days of age. Chicks on 2 % or 3 % F. roseum-contaminated grain survived the experimental period and osteochondrosis was well-developed in the proximal tibias of 85 or 90 % of these chicks. The number of chondroclasts was reduced markedly in the affected bones. Defective <b>chondroclasis</b> {{may play a role}} in the pathogenesis of osteochondrosis associated with F. roseum. Tibial dyschondroplasia is a common abnormality in growing broiler chickens and turkeys throughout the world. The lesion is characterized by the presence of a cone of cartilage which extends distally from the proximal tibiotarsal physis [l- 4, 6, 8, 13 - 15, 18, 191. Abnormalities of this type are not limited to the tibiotarsus; they also occur in the tarsometatarsus, humerus, and femur [9, 101. Similar lesions occur in swine, horses, bulls, and dogs, and the term osteochondrosis has been recommended for the lesion in all species [7]...|$|E
