By the start of World War II, the Big Four zaibatsu (Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Yasuda and Mitsui) alone had direct control over more than 30% of Japan's mining, chemical, and metals industries and almost 50% control of the machinery and equipment market, a significant part of the foreign commercial merchant fleet and 70% of the <b>commercial</b> <b>stock</b> exchange.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, the tonal {{palette of}} the {{electric}} guitar was further modified by introducing effect units in its signal path, before the guitar amp, of {{which one of the}} earliest units was the fuzz pedal. Effects units come in several formats, the most common of which are the stompbox [...] "pedal" [...] and the rackmount unit. A stomp box (or pedal) is a small metal or plastic box containing the circuitry, which is placed {{on the floor in front}} of the musician and connected in line with the patch cord connected to the instrument. The box is typically controlled by one or more foot-pedal on-off switches and it typically contains only one or two effects. Pedals are smaller than rackmount effects and usually less expensive. [...] "Guitar pedalboards" [...] are used by musicians who use multiple stomp-boxes; these may be a DIY project made with plywood or a <b>commercial</b> <b>stock</b> or custom-made pedalboard.|$|E
5000|$|The film cost $300,000 to make. The {{group did}} receive some {{financial}} support from outside sources, including the Film Fund, a New York City based non-profit. Grants comprised a nominal amount of the team’s budget, and the film was largely funded by the filmmakers themselves. Jayne Loader stated in an interview, “Had we relied on grants, we would have starved" [...] Pierce Rafferty helped to support the team and the film financially by working as a consultant and researcher on several other documentary films including El Salvador—Another Vietnam, With Babies and Banners, and The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter.

5000|$|By 1968, Jerry Lee Lewis {{had been}} touring the United States and Europe {{consistently}} {{for ten years}} in hopes of re-establishing the stardom that he had enjoyed during his time at Sun Records in the 1950s, before his marriage to his thirteen-year-old cousin Myra derailed his career. Although he remained a riveting live performer (as can be heard on the album Live at the Star Club, 1964), {{he had not been}} a relevant presence on the charts, although he had scored a minor hit with a cover of the Ray Charles song [...] "What'd I Say" [...] in 1961. In 1963, Lewis left Sun for Smash (later absorbed into Mercury Records) but, despite a string of musically diverse albums, did not score another hit. [...] "When the DJs stopped playing my records, I never said anything," [...] Lewis explained in the sleeve for the 2006 retrospective A Half Century of Hits. [...] "What could I do? Hollar and scream at 'em? For a while they wasn't playing Elvis, Chuck Berry, or none of them. You'd think rock 'n’ roll had died in the night. All they played was them Bobbys - Bobby Vee, Bobby Vinton, Bobby Rydell, Bobby Darin. If your name was Bobby, you were in with a sporting chance. I must be the only artist in the world who's been down as many times as I have. I mean down to rock bottom. I was making ten thousand a night, and got knocked back to two-fifty." [...] Frustrated at what he saw as a lack of support from his record label, Lewis was nearing the end of his contract when promotions manager Eddie Kilroy called him and pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in Nashville. By this point, Lewis' <b>commercial</b> <b>stock</b> was extremely low. In Nick Tosches Lewis biography Hellfire, Kilroy recalls calling every credible publisher in Nashville asking for material for Jerry Lee, but only three acetates turned up after two weeks, adding, [...] "That was all the material that had come in. Nobody wanted a Jerry Lee Lewis cut. I thought, Holy God, this is embarrassing." [...] With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the Jerry Chestnut song [...] "Another Place, Another Time," [...] which was released as a single on March 9, 1968 and, to everyone's amazement, shot up the country charts. At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing Iago in a rock and roll adaptation of Othello called Catch My Soul in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer Jerry Kennedy.|$|E
40|$|Purpose.

Methodology. During the analysis of the biological state of the Prussian carp <b>commercial</b> <b>stock,</b> the main attention was given to the dynamics of age and sexual structure, length-weight growth rate, absolute fecundity and condition factor. The basic data were collected during the work of control-observation stations of the Institute of Fisheries in the Dnieper-Bug estuary during the current century. The collection and processing of ichthyological materials were performed in accordance with the generally accepted methodologies. Findings. The analysis showed that during the current century, the age structure of the Prussian carp of the Dnieper-Bug estuary was the most labile among other commercial cyprinids. It was found {{that as a result of}} an increase in the right wing of the age series, there was a gradual increase of the mean weighted age of its <b>commercial</b> <b>stock.</b> At the beginning of studies (2001 - 2002), the core of the stock was formed by age- 3 - 6 fish (up); however in subsequent years, a displacement of dominant groups toward the dominance of age- 4 - 7 fish (more than 80...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{preferences}} of a captive herd of goats with feral ancestry were evaluated for 11 artificial pest control baits and <b>commercial</b> <b>stock</b> feed pellets. A <b>commercial</b> <b>stock</b> food pellet (based on barley, bran, and oats) {{was the most}} preferred basic bait. A mixture of 2 % diced Griselinia littoralis (broadleaf) leaves (a preferred natural food plant) and 2 % molasses (per weight of basic bait) increased palatability of this basic bait. The best lured bait was aerially sown at 1 kg ha- 1 in a 380 ha area with about 50 feral goats. Only 25 % of the goats were shown by the biological tracer iophenoxic acid to have eaten baits after 8 days. We conclude that one-hit aerial poisoning of goats {{is unlikely to be}} effective as a control method because most goats are unlikely to eat food from off the ground. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} the precautionary demand for commodity stocks. It suggests that commodity stocks are held for precautionary purposes by producers, consumers, and intermediate processors, while speculators hold stocks on the expectation of capital gains from a subsequent price rise. Producer and consumer stocks usually account for the largest share of <b>commercial</b> <b>stocks</b> held {{at any point in}} time. For example, at the end of 1990, stocks held by producers and consumers of copper were 72 percent of all <b>commercial</b> <b>stocks</b> of the market economy countries. Yet, the theory explaining the behavior of this class of stocks has not progressed much beyond the concept of convenience yield, first introduced by Kaldor (1939). This paper proposes an alternative theory. Holding of stocks by producers and consumers is viewed as precautionary behavior towards output and price risks. As a theory of behavior towards risks, the precautionary stock demand model encompasses speculative demand by both producers and consumers. Furthermore, both stocks and futures are treated as precautionary instruments, in contrast to the dichotomy that only stocks provide convenience yield while futures are hedging instruments.

40|$|Gilthead {{seabream}} (Sparus aurata) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important species among intensively reared fish in the Mediterranean region. Although there is a considerable interest in the genetic improvement of this species, many of the genetic parameters of <b>commercial</b> <b>stocks</b> have yet to be investigated. The effective population size (Ne) of a commercial gilthead seabream broodstock was determined using microsatellite analysis. Eight microsatellite loci were used to ensure a high confidence to the parental assignment of offspring from several mass-spawning events. The Ne was consistently low, ranging from 14 to 18, between photoperiod-controlled broodstock groups. This equated to an inbreeding rate of 2. 7 - 3. 5 % per generation. The primary constraint on Ne was the high variance in family size and fewer males than females contributing to each spawning. The contribution of male parents to spawning was also more variable than females. Log-linear modelling of offspring counts revealed a significant quadratic relationship, with intermediate parental weights being optimum. The relationship between parental weight and contribution may be evidence of an optimum age structure to the broodstock, or stabilising selection. Low Ne in <b>commercial</b> <b>stocks</b> of gilthead seabream could lead to an increased risk of inbreeding through the practice of broodstock replacement from within same-farm populations...|$|R
