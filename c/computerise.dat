40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look at}} the {{relationship}} between <b>computerised</b> internal control systems and its relationship to fraud in small businesses. In recent years with the advancement of information technology, the cost of acquiring and implementing a <b>computerised</b> information system is such that many small businesses are able to implement such systems. An implication of this is that internal controls related to the <b>computerised</b> systems will have to be implemented as well. Hence, in this paper {{we look at the}} relationship between <b>computerised</b> internal controls and detected fraud. Results indicate that the incidence of fraud in a <b>computerised</b> internal control environment is higher than in a non <b>computerised</b> environment...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Magnetic {{resonance}} cholangiography is a {{new technique}} which has already gained a role in primary sclerosing cholangitis. <b>Computerised</b> tomographic cholangiography is another non-invasive technique which {{has been used in}} assessing abnormal biliary tree, but has never been applied to evaluating primary sclerosing cholangitis. AIMS: To evaluate the ability of both magnetic resonance cholangiography and <b>computerised</b> tomographic cholangiography to detect bile duct changes in primary sclerosing cholangitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance cholangiography and <b>computerised</b> tomographic cholangiography were performed in 16 primary sclerosing cholangitis patients. The <b>computerised</b> tomographic cholangiography data set was transferred to a processing workstation to obtain tridimensional reconstructions. Magnetic resonance cholangiography and <b>computerised</b> tomographic cholangiography images were analysed blind by two radiologists to assess: primary sclerosing cholangitis involvement, quality of imaging and the radiologist's certainty in determining the presence and location of the disease. RESULTS: Mean imaging quality was significantly better with <b>computerised</b> tomographic cholangiography compared with magnetic resonance cholangiography. Primary sclerosing cholangitis was identified in 15 cases with <b>computerised</b> tomographic cholangiography and 10 with magnetic resonance cholangiography (P < 0. 05). Sensitivity in diagnosing primary sclerosing cholangitis was 94 % with <b>computerised</b> tomographic cholangiography versus 63 % with magnetic resonance cholangiography. Intrahepatic location was found in 14 cases, definitely present in 10 cases with <b>computerised</b> tomographic cholangiography and five with magnetic resonance cholangiography. Extrahepatic location was found in 13 cases, definitely present in 11 cases with <b>computerised</b> tomographic cholangiography and four with magnetic resonance cholangiography (P < 0. 05). <b>Computerised</b> tomographic cholangiography also offered dynamic information about biliary excretion. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Computerised</b> tomographic cholangiography enables more accurate detection and location of primary sclerosing cholangitis than magnetic resonance cholangiography. Since <b>computerised</b> tomographic cholangiography offers additional information about biliary excretion, it may be proposed as an integrative technique in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis...|$|R

Unauthorised triggering of such <b>computerised</b> models {{has been overlooked}} in the security literature. In this paper, we propose two frameworks to analyse the security of systems that have the data-triggering <b>computerised</b> model architecture. The frameworks help understand how to mitigate the cyber attacks that can be launched against the data-model systems, by modifying the <b>computerised</b> models or the data. We then propose a Deterministic Specification distributed intrusion Detection System (DSdIDS) to secure the data-triggering model systems from internal as well as external cyber threats. <b>computerised</b> models; cyber security; finance models; electronic security; e-security; cyber crimes; unauthorised access; data triggering; data models; deterministic specifications; distributed intrusion; detection systems; DSdIDS; internal threats; external threats; integrity attacks; electronic finance; e-finance. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{draws on}} data {{collected}} during a 2 -year project examining {{the deployment of}} a <b>computerised</b> decision support system. This <b>computerised</b> decision support system {{was designed to be}} used by non-clinical staff for dealing with calls to emergency (999) and urgent care (out-of-hours) services. One of the promises of <b>computerised</b> decisions support technologies is that they can 'hold' vast amounts of sophisticated clinical knowledge and combine it with decision algorithms to enable standardised decision-making by non-clinical (clerical) staff. This article draws on our ethnographic study of this <b>computerised</b> decision support system in use, and we use our analysis to question the 'automated' vision of decision-making in healthcare call-handling. We show that embodied and experiential (human) expertise remains central and highly salient in this work, and we propose that the deployment of the <b>computerised</b> decision support system creates something new, that this conjunction of computer and human creates a cyborg practice. <br/...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{potential}} for using routine <b>computerised</b> general practice data for surveillance of illness. DESIGN: Comparison of the incidence of influenza during the 1989 epidemic derived from a <b>computerised</b> database with that derived from the Royal College of General Practitioners's weekly returns service [...] a well established predominantly manual surveillance system. SETTING: 433 general practices throughout the United Kingdom that used a commercial computer system linked to a central databank. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of influenza. RESULTS: The slope of the influenza epidemic curve was essentially the same whether derived from the routine <b>computerised</b> data or royal college's weekly returns service data, and the <b>computerised</b> data were geographically consistent. Throughout the study period, however, the computer derived incidence was between one third and one quarter of that derived from the royal college's system (which is served by practitioners trained in surveillance methods). The peak weekly rates were 164 cases per 100, 000 for the <b>computerised</b> system and 583 cases per 100, 000 for the royal college's surveillance system. CONCLUSIONS: The apparent underreporting in the routine <b>computerised</b> data probably reflects lack of motivation and experience in disease surveillance and haphazard computer entry (particularly of consultations that took place outside of the surgery and consultations that {{did not result in}} a prescription), along with overestimation of the population under surveillance. Nevertheless, routine <b>computerised</b> surveillance allows rapid data collection from a large number of practices over a wide geographical area and would greatly augment existing methods...|$|R
