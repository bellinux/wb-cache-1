40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the shape of dental cavities made with the CVDentus® system using different ultrasound power levels. One standard cavity was made on the buccal aspect of 15 bovine incisors with a CVDentus® <b>cylindrical</b> <b>bur</b> (82142). The sample was divided into three groups: G 1 - ultrasound with power II; G 2 - ultrasound with power III; and G 3 - ultrasound with power IV. A standardizing device was used to obtain standardized preparations and ultrasound was applied during one minute in each dental preparation. The cavities were sectioned in the middle, allowing observation of the cavitys profile with a magnifying glass, and width and depth measurement using the Leica Qwin program. The Kruskal-Wallis (p < 0. 05) and Dunn statistical analyses demonstrated differences between the dental cavity shapes when powers III and IV were used. However, the cavities that were made with power III presented dimensions similar to those of the bur used for preparation. We concluded that the power recommended by the manufacturer (III) is the most adequate for use with the CVDentus® system...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} 15 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) -S (EDTA with soft soap) preparation {{for the removal of}} smear layer at human root surfaces. Materials and Methods: Twenty teeth indicated for extraction due to periodontal disease were sectioned using high speed <b>cylindrical</b> <b>bur</b> under copious irrigation. The root surfaces were instrumented with Gracey 7 - 8 curette (Hu-Friedy), 12 times to induce an "experimental smear layer". Following root planning, the root surface was cut using diamond disc and separated from the crown. Samples were randomly distributed into five groups. One group was control, saline and test groups were EDTA 15 % alone, by active and passive applications (groups 2 and 3), and EDTA 15 %+soft soap, by active and passive applications (groups 4 and 5). Specimens were then subjected to scanning electron microscope study. Smear layer removal was evaluated according to Sampaio et al., index. Results: EDTA-S removed the smear layer better than plain EDTA and the control group, while active application of the root conditioning agent had significant difference than the passive application of the agent. Conclusion: EDTA-S has favorable benefits over EDTA alone, and active application is better in comparison with passive application of root conditioning agent. Clinical Relevance: Removal of smear layer has been considered as an important step in periodontal regenerative therapy. Scaling and root planning alone with saline irrigation does not remove the smear layer. EDTA is a commonly used root conditioning agent in periodontal therapy. The addition of a detergent to EDTA proved to remove smear layer more efficiently than EDTA alone...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{surgery is}} a {{recently}} developed system for cutting bone with microvibrations. The {{aim of this}} study was to effectuate a histological comparison between conventional drills vs. ultrasonic surgery devices in implant bed preparation. Materials and methods: Ten bovine ribs were appropriately removed from soft tissues (connective, cartilage, fat etc) in order to obtain the underlying bone, and then stored for 1 - 2 days at 4 °C. Each rib was individuated in two halves. On each half 5 implant sites were randomly prepared (10 sites per rib). A single <b>cylindrical</b> <b>bur,</b> 13 mm height and 2 mm width, (Bone System, Milan, Italy) at a speed of 400 rpm was used to prepare the implant sites of group (A) and 5 implant sites was prepare with the piezoelectric device (SURGYSONIC, ESACROM, IMOLA, ITALY) mounted with a diamond-coated cylindrical tip. After implant site preparation the ribs were stored immediately in 10 % buffered formalin and processed to obtain thin ground sections. The specimens were processed using the Precise 1 Automated System (Assing, Rome, Italy). Results: osteotomy drill (group A) surfaces treated appeared not very different from those treated with piezoelectric device (group B); A higher magnification showed the presence of microcracks created on the interface. The latter appeared numerous for group A and had thickness and depth amounted to 20 - 120 μ and 500 - 1000 μ, respectively. While they were irrilevant or completely absent in group B. No statistical significant differences were found between the two groups on bone marrow (P: 0. 174). Conclusions: ultrasonicsurgery device showed a higher performance in terms of accuracy and uniformity in quality of osteotomy cut, compared with conventional rotary instrument...|$|E
40|$|Background/purpose: One of {{the major}} {{educational}} goals in preclinical dental education is to learn tooth preparation techniques. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of different preparation designs on the development of the manual dexterity of students, in order to perform a state-of-the-art tooth preparation. Material and methods: Seventy-two 1 st semester students were divided into two groups and educated in tooth preparation for a ceramic anterior single crown. One group received <b>cylindrical</b> <b>burs</b> with a rounded edge to prepare a typodont model with a shoulder finishing line, while the other group had <b>cylindrical</b> <b>burs</b> with round noses to prepare a chamfer finishing line. All preparations were digitized and evaluated using special software focusing on the parameters of preparation depth and preparation angle. In addition, violation of the adjacent teeth was estimated. Data was statistically evaluated at a level of significance of 5 %. Results: The preparation design used did not show a statistically significant influence on the preparation depth or on the preparation angle. A trend to a higher tooth structure removal as required was detected. Furthermore, no influence of the type of preparation design on the number of violated adjacent teeth was found. Conclusion: In preclinical dental education, the type of preparation design was found to have no influence on the measured parameters representing the quality of the preparation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} influence of different sterilization methods on cutting effectiveness and durability of <b>cylindrical</b> ultrasonic <b>burs</b> compared with conventional <b>cylindrical</b> diamond-coated <b>burs.</b> Material and Methods: Fifteen conventional cylindrical diamond-coated (1092) (KG Sorensen) coupled to a high-speed turbine, and fifteen cylindrical ultrasonic (8. 2137) (CVDentus®) burs coupled to an ultrasound-handpiece were used to perform standardized cavity preparations in healthy bovine tooth fragments, cleaned with rubber cup, pumice stone and water. After every 10 preparations, burs were sterilized 9 times in autoclave (SA), oven (SO), or cleaned with brush, soap and water (C). Fragments were weighed and microphotographs of burs were taken {{at the beginning and}} end of experiment. Another 9 conventional diamond-coated and 9 CVD burs underwent the same sterilization cycles in autoclave (SAC), oven (SOC) or washed with soap and water (CC) however, without being used for making cavity preparations, serving as control. Descriptive analyses were made of the values found by weighing and microphotography scores. Results: Statistically significant differences (Paired Student’s-t test) were observed among burs after sterilization (p = 0. 0001). SO and SA did not influence cutting effectiveness and durability of ultrasonic and conventional diamond-coated burs. The microphotographs showed morphological differences between the burs used for preparation and the control. Conclusion: Sterilization by oven and autoclave did not influence cutting effectiveness and durability of CVD and conventional diamond-coated burs. Conventional diamond-coated burs presented greater structural alterations after performing cavity preparations and cleaning/sterilization procedures, irrespective of the process used.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the cutting ability of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond burs coupled to an ultrasonic dental unit handpiece for minimally invasive cavity preparation. One standard cavity was prepared on the mesial and distal surfaces of 40 extracted human third molars either with cylindrical or with spherical CVD burs. The cutting ability was compared regarding type of substrate (enamel and dentin) and direction of handpiece motion. The morphological characteristics, width and depth of the cavities were analyzed and measured using scanning electron micrographs. Statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0. 05) revealed that the width and depth of the cavities were significantly greater when they were prepared on dentin. Wider cavities were prepared when the <b>cylindrical</b> CVD <b>bur</b> was used, and deeper cavities resulted from preparation with the spherical CVD bur. The direction of handpiece motion did not influence the size of the cavities, and the CVD burs produced precise and conservative cutting...|$|R
40|$|Background: Evaluation of microleakage is {{important}} for assessing the success of new methods for surface preparation and new adhesive restorative materials. The aim of this laboratory study was to assess microleakage {{at the margins of}} composite restorations in Er,Cr:YSGG laser prepared cavities on the cervical aspects of teeth by means of dye penetration, and compare this with conventionally prepared and conditioned cavities. Methods: Class V cavities were produced on sound extracted human teeth, which had been assigned randomly to one of three groups (N = 10 each), as follows: Group 1 – prepared using a diamond <b>cylindrical</b> <b>bur</b> and then treated with 37 % phosphoric acid; Group 2 – irradiated with an Er,Cr:YSGG laser (Biolase Waterlase) and then treated with 37 % phosphoric acid; Group 3 – irradiated only with the laser. After application of bonding agent (Excite, Ivoclar Vivadent), all cavities were restored with composite resin (Heliomolar). After polishing the restorations, the teeth were thermocycled from 5 – 50 °C for 500 cycles. Dye leakage was assessed after immersion in methylene blue, by examining longitudinal sections in a stereomicroscope at × 30 magnification. Results: The extent of dye penetration was lowest in the laser only group (Group 3). Penetration of dye to dentine and axial walls occurred in 80 per cent of conventionally prepared (bur + acid) specimens, but in the laser group, dye penetration to the axial wall occurred in only 30 per cent of cases. There was a strong statistical association between treatment group and the distribution of microleakage scores (Chi-square, P = 0. 0023). Conclusions: For Class V cavities, with the adhesive materials employed, higher microleakage occurs with phosphoric acid etching of bur- or laser-cut surfaces, than with the surface created by use of the laser alone without additional conditioning...|$|E
40|$|Statement of problem. Dental {{fractures}} {{can occur}} in endodontically treated teeth restored with posts. Purpose. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the in vitro fracture resistance of roots with glass-fiber and metal posts of different lengths. Material and methods. Sixty endodontically treated maxillary canines were embedded in acrylic resin, except for 4 mm of the cervical area, after removing the clinical crowns. The post spaces were opened with a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>bur</b> at low speed attached to a surveyor, resulting in preparations with lengths of 6 mm (group 6 mm), 8 mm (group 8 mm), or 10 mm (group 10 mm). Each group was divided into 2 subgroups according to the post material: cast post and core or glass-fiber post (n= 30). The posts were luted with dual-polymerizing resin cement (Panavia F). Cast posts and cores of Co-Cr (Resilient Plus) crowns were made and cemented with zinc phosphate. Specimens were subjected to increasing compressive load (N) until fracture. Data were analyzed with 2 -way ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer test (alpha=. 05). Results. The ANOVA analysis indicated significant differences (P<. 05) among the groups, and the Tukey test revealed no significant difference among the metal posts of 6 -mm length (26. 5 N +/- 13. 4), 8 -mm length (25. 2 N +/- 13. 9), and 10 -mm length (17. 1 N +/- 5. 2). Also, in the glass-fiber post group, there was no significant difference when posts of 8 -mm length (13. 4 N +/- 11. 0) were compared with the 6 -mm (6. 9 N +/- 4. 6) and 10 -mm (31. 7 N +/- 13. 1) groups. The 10 -mm-long post displayed superior fracture resistance, and the 6 -mm-long post showed significantly lower mean values (P<. 001). Conclusions. Within the limitations of this study, it was concluded that the glass-fiber post represents a viable alternative to the cast metal post, increasing the resistance to fracture of endodontically treated canines.

40|$|Nowadays, {{there are}} many {{techniques}} to compensate bone atrophies of the posterior maxilla {{in order to obtain}} an implant-supported rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: This case series describes the Ebanist technique: a sinus lift procedure to be used in case of extremely resorbed bone crests (≤ 3 mm) allowing simultaneous implant placement. METHODS: With a dedicated <b>cylindrical</b> trephine <b>bur,</b> it is possible to harvest a cylinder of bone from a fresh mineralized frozen homologous bone block graft and to simultaneously create a trapdoor on the recipient site. The trapdoor cortical bone is detached from the sinus membrane and removed. Dental implant is placed into the graft before the grafting procedure since the cylindrical block, once inserted in the recipient area, is not able to oppose sufficient resistance to the torque needed for implant placement. RESULTS: Second-stage surgery and following prosthetic rehabilitation were performed after 5 months. In all cases, implant stability was manually checked and no pathological symptoms or signs were recovered at any follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: This technique can be considered a valid procedure for implant therapy on atrophic posterior upper maxillae, when the residual bone crest is extremely resorbed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} the method and period of storage on the adhesive bond strength of indirect composite resin to bovine dentin. Ninety bovine incisors were stored in three different solutions: 0. 2 % thymol, 10 % formalin, and 0. 2 % sodium azide, during 3 periods of storage: 7 days, 30 days and 6 months, resulting in 9 groups (n = 10). The roots were cut off and the buccal surface was ground with # 600 -grit silicon carbide paper. The surface was conditioned with 37 % phosphoric acid for 15 s and a composite resin restoration (TPH Spectrum) was fixed using a one-bottle adhesive system (Adper Single Bond) and a dual-cured resinous cement (Rely X ARC) under a load of 500 g for 5 minutes. The samples were serially cut perpendicular to the bonded interface to obtain slices of 1. 2 mm in thickness. Each slab was trimmed with a <b>cylindrical</b> diamond <b>bur</b> resulting in an hourglass shape with a cross-sectional area of approximately 1 mm². The microtensile bond strength (&# 956;TBS) testing was performed in a testing machine (EMIC 2000 DL) at a 0. 5 mm/minute crosshead-speed until failure. After fracture, the specimens were examined under SEM to analyze the mode of fracture. &# 956;TBS Means were expressed in MPa and the data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (3 X 3) and the Tukey test (&# 945; = 0. 05). The storage times of 7 and 30 days produced no significant difference irrespective of the solution type. The formalin and thymol solutions, however, did have a negative influence on bond strength when the teeth were stored for 6 months...|$|R
40|$|The resin cements are {{responsible}} to retention of the indirect materials decreasing marginal leakage, increasing failure resistance compared with conventional cementation. The cementation within root canal {{is very hard}} due unfavorable conditions regarding the application of adhesive techniques caused by inadequate access. Therefore, considering the possibility to decrease steps of cementation, this study was performed to evaluate the bond strength of self-adhesive resin cement (RelyX (TM) U 100, 3 M ESPE) and resin cement combined with self-ecthing adhesive system (Panavia (R) F 2. 0, Kuraray) light-cured with Quartz Tungsten Halogen (QTH) following storage at 37 degrees C immediately after light-curing, 24 and 48 hours and 7 days. The root canals were prepared to receive the glass fiber post in the depth of 10 mm, irrigated with 17 % EDTA and NaOCl, rinsed with distilled water and dried using paper points. The roots were perpendicularly sectioned into approximately 1 mm thick sections, obtaining ninety-six slices (n = 12). The slices were trimmed using a <b>cylindrical</b> diamond <b>bur</b> in the proximal surfaces until it touched the post and attached into a device, which were mounted on a strength tester (Bisco) and loaded in tension at a speed of 0. 5 mm/min until failure occurred at specimens. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post-hoc tests showed significant statistical differences (P. 05). The resin cements 24 and 48 hours after light-curing were statistically similar among themselves (P >. 05). The both resin cement showed similar bond strength into root canal on different storage times. The highest bond strength values of the resin cements were showed 7 days after curing...|$|R
