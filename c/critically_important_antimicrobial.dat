40|$|Urinary tract infections (UTI) {{are one of}} {{the most}} common {{bacterial}} infections in hospital and community settings requiring antimicrobial treatment. Escherichia coli (E. coli), a bacterium frequently implicated in UTI, is becoming increasingly resistant to antimicrobials. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) reduces the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents, leading to difficulty in treatment of patients, with the potential to prolong the duration of illness and increase mortality in patients. To date in Australia, there is a paucity of data comparing resistance patterns over time for hospital- and community-acquired E. coli UTI with no published data on incidence and risk of urinary E. coli resistance in Australia. Ciprofloxacin, a high priority <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobial,</b> is not recommended for empirical therapy of UTI yet resistance to this antimicrobial agent is increasing. There are no systematic reviews of studies investigating ciprofloxacin resistance in hospital- and community-acquired E. coli UTI. Therefore, the research program sought to address these knowledge gaps in three separate but interrelated studies. The research described in this thesis is the first of its kind in Australia...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate to what extent variations in herd-level antimicrobial consumption (AMC) can be explained by differences in management practices that are consistently effective in the prevention of (sub) clinical mastitis, on the one hand, and by differences in mastitis treatment strategies, on the other hand. Antimicrobial consumption data were obtained during 2012 and 2013 by "garbage can audits" and expressed as antimicrobial treatment incidences (ATI) for all compounds combined (total ATI) and for the <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> for human health separately. Data on mastitis prevention and control practices were obtained via face-to-face interviews performed during herd visits in March 2013. Some management practices and treatment strategies related to udder health were associated with the total AMC. However, the results demonstrated that implementing effective udder health management practices does not necessarily imply a low AMC and vice versa. Herds participating in a veterinary herd health management program and herds selectively drying off cows used fewer antimicrobials compared with herds not participating in such a program or applying blanket dry-cow therapy. Moreover, herds treating (some) (sub) clinical mastitis cases with intramammary homeopathic substances consumed fewer antimicrobials than herds not applying such homeopathic treatments. Besides these factors, no other direct association was found between effective udder health management practices {{on the one hand and}} AMC on the other hand. Also, the use of <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> was only associated with the way in which subclinical mastitis cases were treated. The latter indicates that the AMC of <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> is potentially driven by factors other than those included in this study such as those related to the "mindset" of the veterinarians and their farmers.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a retrospective study of Salmonella Newport infections among Wisconsin residents during 2003 – 2005. Multidrug resistance prevalence was substantially greater in Wisconsin than {{elsewhere in the}} United States. Persons with multidrug-resistant infections {{were more likely than}} persons with susceptible infections to report exposure to cattle, farms, and unpasteurized milk. During the past decade, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica serotype Newport strains in the United States have increased substantially (1). The prevalence of the most common MDR S. Newport phenotype, Newport-MDRAmpC, increased from 1 % of human S. Newport isolates tested in 1998 to 21 % of isolates tested in 2003 (2). Newport-MDRAmpC is resistant to at least chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole/sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftiofur, and cephalothin. This phenotype exhibits decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (2), a <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> agent for treating invasive salmonellosis in children (3). Studies suggest that dairy cattle are a major US reservoir for MDR S. Newport (4 – 6). However, data documenting the prevalence of MDR S.

40|$|Indiscriminate {{prescribing}} {{practices and}} the overuse of antimicrobials {{have been identified}} as a key driver for the emergence of antimicrobial resistant strains of bacteria in both humans and animals. Thus, it is essential that antimicrobial use practices are optimal and responsible to minimise these selection pressures. Antimicrobial use in pigs has been highlighted as an area of particular concern in the UK and Europe. The aims of this thesis were to provide a clear understanding of the motivations, practices, behaviours and attitudes surrounding the prescribing and use of antimicrobials in the UK pig industry, deemed an essential step optimising antimicrobial use. This thesis combines both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Six initial focus group studies were held with pig veterinary surgeons (n= 9) and farmers (n= 17) to explore open-ended themes surrounding antimicrobial use and prescribing behaviours in pigs. The themes that emerged were explored in more detail using in-depth individual, face-to-face interviews with both farmers (n= 22) and veterinary surgeons (n= 21). A thematic approach was used for analysis. These results informed a quantitative questionnaire study which tested and explored key themes. The questionnaires were distributed to pig veterinary surgeons and farmers across England, Wales and Scotland. Results from 261 farmers and 61 veterinary surgeons were analysed using a predominantly descriptive approach, with analysis used to test the statistical significance of comparative respondent categories and multivariable logistic regression to explore risk factors for antimicrobial use on respondent farms. Additionally, open questions were analysed using a thematic approach. Most veterinary surgeons and farmers showed personal confidence that their own antimicrobial use was prudent and demonstrated a social responsibility to reserve the use of the <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> classes. However, many described clinical examples of the use of a <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> as a first line treatment, and farmer awareness of critically important antimicrobials was low. At odds with this sense of individual responsible use there was concern that antimicrobial use by other veterinary surgeons and farmers may be less responsible. The ‘habitual’ use of in-feed antimicrobials for disease prevention and use to overcome poor management were used to exemplify irresponsible use. Antimicrobial resistance was seldom cited as a clinical issue on farms, however there was dissonance in the perception of resistance on farms; both veterinary surgeons and farmers highlighted issues of treatment failures but could not, or did not, directly relate these to resistance. Additionally, whilst diagnostic testing, to identify causative agents and the most appropriate antimicrobial, were considered important their use was infrequently reported with financial implications and the time delay cited as reasons for this. Respondents expressed a desire to seek alternatives to prevent disease and decrease the use of antimicrobials such as improved internal and external biosecurity measures, more effective vaccination strategies, improved housing and improved herd health. However, the high cost required to make facility improvements coupled with the poor economic return on pig meat were commonly cited as a hurdle to reducing antimicrobial use on farms. Veterinary surgeons felt a major professional and moral obligation for animal health and welfare and this was also a recurring theme for farmers. It is clear that farmers and veterinary surgeons {{need to be able to}} make informed decisions to change and minimise antimicrobial use without compromising the health and welfare of animals under their care. There were contrasts in the way in which veterinary surgeons and farmers perceived their relationship; farmers identified a partnership where decisions are made mutually, whilst many veterinary surgeons identified pressure from clients to prescribe antimicrobials and some had concerns over poor farmer compliance in administering antimicrobials. The complexity surrounding prescribing decisions and use on farms suggests a combination of approaches is likely to be needed to ensure that antimicrobial prescribing is optimal and to achieve significant reductions in use...|$|E
30|$|In {{the second}} part of our study, {{antimicrobial}} resistance profile of isolates has been investigated. The World Health Organisation has divided antimicrobials in three categories as <b>critically</b> <b>important,</b> highly important and important according to their importance in human medicine (Collignon et al. 2009). In this study, six <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> (namely; gentamicin, netilmicin, imipenem, amikacin, erythromycine, ciprofloxacin), six highly <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> (cefazolin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and cefoxitin) and two <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> (clindamycin, mupirocin) were tested. One isolates found to be resistant to <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> and eight isolates were resistant to two highly <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials.</b> Multi drug resistance (MDR) was determined from a mouth isolates, which was resistant to erythromycin and mupirocin but none of the isolates were methicillin resistant. Sepin-Özen et al. (2013) reported that percentage of MRSA as 5.3 among food handlers work in Antalya, Turkey. In other study, nasal carriage rate of MRSA reported as 18  % (6 out of 34 farm workers) among farm workers in Turkey (Hazımoğlu 2011). In a study conducted on food handlers it was reported that only one isolate out of 200 isolates (Udo et al. 2009) was methicillin resistant. Similarly, Kamal et al. (2013) also found that none of the hand swabs of S. aureus isolates from the dairy workers and food handlers was positive for the mecA gene. Collignon et al. (2009) reported that although it currently represents a low proportion of the total MRSA infections that occur in people, there are an increasing number of reports of animal-derived MRSA especially from pigs, causing community-onset infection in people.|$|R
40|$|Antibiotic use was {{described}} using {{a convenience sample}} of 90 Alberta swine farms representing approximately 25 % of the Alberta market swine production. Data on the use of antibiotics were collected through an on-farm interview questionnaire. The vast majority of antibiotics were used in feed.

40|$|Antimicrobials {{have been}} widely used in {{veterinary}} medicine for disease treatment, disease prevention, and growth promotion. Although, the mechanisms about in-feed additives use are still not completely understood, it is accepted that its use improves feed efficiency by reducing the microbial load in the intestinal tract, thereby reducing the pressure on the immune system and increasing energy availability for the animal. However, disruption to commensal bacterial communities by antibiotics in some cases can increase the gut colonization by pathogenic bacteria. In this sense, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the Escherichia coli antibiotic resistance and the gut microbiota profile from pigs raised in Brazilian farms with different in-feed antimicrobials protocols. Pigs from four farms with distinct antibiotic usage, including one farm that used no antibiotics, were followed from weaning to finishing, and the frequency of antimicrobial resistance and gut bacterial profile by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing were evaluated. The gut microbial community structure was the same among all groups of pigs despite different antibiotic use on the farms; however, the antimicrobial resistance profiles of E. coli isolates were different between groups. One farm administered seven antibiotics at different times, and E. coli isolates from these pigs showed higher frequency of resistance and multidrug resistance as compared with samples from the farm that did not administer in-feed antimicrobials. The phenotypes included resistance to drugs considered <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> agents in veterinary medicine (ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, florfenicol, sulfonamide and tetracycline) as well as one highly important antibiotic in human medicine (colistin). Resistant E. coli strains were screened for the presence of the mcr- 1 gene by PCR. The colistin-resistant strains were positive for the presence of the mcr- 1 gene. These results suggest that although different antibiotic uses on-farm might not impact microbial community structure, it does impact bacterial functions, namely antibiotic resistance. Our results show that prudent use of antimicrobials is important for decreasing selective pressure for antibiotic resistance gene evolution...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{emergence}} of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in zoonotic foodborne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter) and indicator microorganisms (E. coli, enterococci) {{is a major}} public health risk. Zoonotic bacteria, resistant to antimicrobials, are of special concern because they might compromise the effective treatment of infections in humans. Scope and approach In this review, the AMR monitoring and surveillance programmes in five selected countries within European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) are described. The sampling schemes, susceptibility testing for AMR identification, clinical breakpoints (clinical resistance) and epidemiological cut-off values (microbiological resistance) were considered {{to reflect on the}} most important variations between and within food-producing animal species, between countries, and to identify the most effective approach to tackle and manage the antimicrobial resistance in the food chain. Key findings and conclusions The science-based monitoring of AMR should encompass the whole food chain, supported with public health surveillance and should be conducted in accordance with ‘Zoonoses Directive’ (99 / 2003 /EC). Such approach encompasses the integrated AMR monitoring in food animals, food and humans in the whole food (meat) chain continuum, e. g. pre-harvest (on-farm), harvest (in abattoir) and post-harvest (at retail). The information on AMR in <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> (CIA) for human medicine should be of particular importance...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobials {{are widely}} used in {{veterinary}} practices, {{but there has been}} no investigation of antimicrobial classes used or the appropriateness of their use in bovine practice. This study investigated antimicrobial use for surgical prophylaxis in bovine practice in Australia. A cross-sectional study of veterinarian antimicrobial usage patterns was conducted using an online questionnaire. Information solicited included respondent's details, the frequency with which antimicrobials were used for specific surgical conditions (including the dose, timing and duration of therapy) and details of practice antimicrobial use policies and sources of information about antimicrobials. In total, 212 members of the Australian veterinary profession working in bovine practice completed the survey. Antimicrobials were always or frequently used by more than 75 per cent of respondents in all scenarios. Generally, antimicrobial drug choice was appropriate for the reported surgical conditions. Procaine penicillin and oxytetracycline accounted for 93 per cent of use. However, there was a wide range of doses used, with underdosing and inappropriate timing of administration being common reasons for inappropriate prophylactic treatment. There was very low use of <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> (3. 3 per cent of antimicrobials reported).

40|$|Gram-negative {{bacteria}} {{are known to}} cause severe infections in both humans and animals. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Gram-negative bacteria is a major challenge {{in the treatment of}} clinical infections globally due to the propensity of these organisms to rapidly develop resistance against antimicrobials in use. In addition, Gram-negative bacteria possess highly efficient mechanisms through which the AMR can be disseminated between pathogenic and commensal bacteria of the same or different species. These unique traits of Gram-negative bacteria have resulted in evolution of Gram-negative bacterial strains demonstrating resistance to multiple classes of antimicrobials. The evergrowing resistance issue has not only resulted in limitation of treatment options but also led to increased treatment costs and mortality rates in humans and animals. With few or no new antimicrobials in production to combat severe life-threatening infections, AMR has been described as the one of the most severe, long-term threats to human health. Aside from overuse and misuse of antimicrobials in humans, another factor that has exacerbated the emergence of AMR in Gram-negative bacteria is the veterinary use of antimicrobials that belong to the same classes considered to be <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> for treating serious life-threatening infections in humans. Despite the fact that development of AMR dates back to before the introduction of antimicrobials, the recent surge in the resistance towards all available <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> has emerged as a major public health issue. This review thus focuses on discussing the development, transmission and public health impact of AMR in Gram-negative bacteria in animals...|$|R
40|$|Carbapenems are {{antibiotics}} authorised for {{the treatment}} of humans and which were categorised by the World Health Organization as <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> {{for the treatment}} of humans. Reserve antibiotics of this kind are only supposed to be used when standard antibiotics no longer show any effects, i. e. for only stricted indications. A mechanism that leads to a resistance of bacteria to carbapenems is the formation of certain enzymes called carbapenemases. What then happens is that the active substance class of carbapenems can no longer be used {{for the treatment of}} infections which were caused by carbapenemase-producing bacteria. For the first time, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has detected carbapenemase- producing enterobacteria in samples taken from livestock populations. As bacteria can transfer this carbapenem resistance to other bacterial species, consumers could theoretically pick up bacteria with these resistance properties via foods of animal origin or through direct contact with animals. Should treatment with antibiotics then be necessary, germs of this kind could pose a problem if the drug has no effect against the infection. The introduction of bacteria of this kind into hospitals could also have serious consequences and for this reason, the spread of carbapenemase-producing bacteria must be prevented wherever possible.

40|$|Antimicrobial use and {{antimicrobial}} resistance (AMR) in intensive pig production {{and its potential}} impacts to human and animal health are very much under the spotlight, both internationally, and within Australia. While the majority of AMR of medical importance {{is associated with the}} exclusive use of antimicrobials in humans, resistance in zoonotic foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, and livestock commensal bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp., is under increased scrutiny. This is primarily due to the current reliance on many of the same drug classes as used in human medicine for treatment and control of bacterial diseases of livestock. Furthermore, the development of multidrug resistance in pathogens such as enterotoxigenic E. coli may drive off-label use of <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> drug classes such as 3 rd-generation cephalosporins. This could lead to the emergence and amplification of resistance genes of potential public health significance in both pathogens and commensal bacteria. Livestock-associated and community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has also recently been detected in Australian pigs as a result of human-to-animal transmission and are a potential public health issue for in-contact piggery workers. Australia is in a unique position compared with many of its international trading partners due to its isolation, ban on importation of livestock and conservative approach to antimicrobial registration, including reservation of the fluoroquinolone class for use in humans and companion animals only. Cross-sectional AMR surveys of pathogens and commensals in healthy pigs have identified only low frequency of resistance to <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> drug classes.

Pigs represent one of the main species in which antibiotics are frequently used for different purposes. Surveillance of antibiotic consumption and dose appropriateness, through novel approaches based on defined daily doses, is strongly needed to assess farms’ antibiotic risk, in terms of spread of antibiotic resistance and possibile presence of residues in meat. In this study, antibiotic consumption was monitored in 14 swine reproduction farms, together with managerial, structural, and health aspects. Most of the controlled farms (65 %) were classified as at medium antibiotic risk, 21 % at high antibiotic risk, and 14 % at low antibiotic risk.

Isolates {{of the most commonly}} observed O serogroup (O 149) were highly clonal with a lower frequency of antimicrobial resistance compared with the less common O 141 serogroup isolates, which were more genetically diverse and resistant to a greater array of antimicrobials. The O 149 and O 141 isolates belonged to sequence types (STs) ST 100 and ST 1260, respectively. A small number of new STs were identified for the least common serogroups, including O 157 (ST 4245), O 138 (ST 4244), O 139 (ST 4246) and O 8 (ST 4247). A high frequency of plasmid replicons was observed among all ETEC isolates.

Clinical E. coli isolates (n = 324) from Australian food-producing animals [cattle (n = 169), porcine (n = 114), poultry (n = 32) and sheep (n = 9) ] were compiled from all veterinary diagnostic laboratories across Australia over a 1 -year period. Isolates underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing to 18 antimicrobials using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute disc diffusion method. Isolates resistant to CIAs underwent minimum inhibitory concentration determination, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), phylogenetic analysis, plasmid replicon typing, plasmid identification, and virulence and antimicrobial resistance gene typing. The 324 E. coli isolates from different sources exhibited a variable frequency of resistance to tetracycline (29. 0 - 88. 6 %), ampicillin (9. 4 - 71. 1 %), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (11. 1 - 67. 5 %) and streptomycin (21. 9 - 69. 3 %), whereas none were resistant to imipenem or amikacin. Resistance was detected, albeit at low frequency, to ESCs (bovine isolates, 1 %; porcine isolates, 3 %) and FQs (porcine isolates, 1 %).

40|$|International audienceEFSA and EMA have jointly {{reviewed}} {{measures taken}} in the EU to {{reduce the need for}} and use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals, and the resultant impacts on antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Reduction strategies have been implemented successfully in some Member States. Such strategies include national reduction targets, benchmarking of antimicrobial use, controls on prescribing and restrictions on use of specific <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials,</b> together with improvements to animal husbandry and disease prevention and control measures. Due to the multiplicity of factors contributing to AMR, the impact of any single measure is difficult to quantify, although there is evidence of an association between reduction in antimicrobial use and reduced AMR. To minimise antimicrobial use, a multifaceted integrated approach should be implemented, adapted to local circumstances. Recommended options (non-prioritised) include: development of national strategies; harmonised systems for monitoring antimicrobial use and AMR development; establishing national targets for antimicrobial use reduction; use of on-farm health plans; increasing the responsibility of veterinarians for antimicrobial prescribing; training, education and raising public awareness; increasing the availability of rapid and reliable diagnostics; improving husbandry and management procedures for disease prevention and control; rethinking livestock production systems to reduce inherent disease risk. A limited number of studies provide robust evidence of alternatives to antimicrobials that positively influence health parameters.

Antimicrobial consumption data were obtained between 2012 and 2013 by "garbage can audits" and expressed as antimicrobial treatment incidence (ATI), with the unit of the ATI being the number of defined daily doses animal (DDDA) used per 1, 000 cow-days. Herds were stratified by DDDA into low-, medium-, and high-consuming herds to study the AMC per route of administration, and associations with parameters reflecting udder health, milk quality, and production performances were examined. The average ATI in adult dairy cattle for all compounds was 20. 78 DDDA (per 1, 000 cow-days). Large variation existed between herds (ranging from 8. 68 to 41. 62 DDDA). Fourth-generation cephalosporins were used most (4. 99 DDDA), followed by penicillins (3. 70 DDDA) and third-generation cephalosporins (2. 95 DDDA). The average ATI of the <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> for human health (i. e., third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones according to the World Organisation for Animal Health classification) was somewhat lower than the average ATI of the other antimicrobials (8. 59 and 12. 18 DDDA, respectively). The average ATI for intramammary treatment of (sub) clinical mastitis, for dry-cow therapy, and for systemically administered antimicrobials was 6. 30, 6. 89, and 7. 44 DDDA, respectively. In low-consuming herds, most antimicrobials were being used for dry-cow therapy, whereas in high consuming herds, most antimicrobials were being used as injectable or intramammary mastitis therapy. The incidence rate of treated mastitis was positively associated with ATI. Herds that applied blanket dry-cow therapy tended to have a higher ATI than herds in which cows were selectively dried off with long-acting antimicrobials. The ATI decreased with an increasing prevalence of primiparous cows...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Intensification of {{livestock}} production seen in many low- and middle-income countries is often {{believed to be}} associated with increased use of antimicrobials, and may hence contribute to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The aim {{of this study was to}} map antimicrobial use on small- (n =  25) and medium-scale (n =  27) pig farms in north-eastern Thailand, and to compare antimicrobial susceptibility of commensal Escherichia coli isolated from sows on these farms. Methods Information regarding pig husbandry and antimicrobial treatment regimens was obtained by the use of semi-structured questionnaires. Faecal samples were collected from three healthy sows at each farm, and Escherichia coli was cultured and analysed for antimicrobial susceptibility using the broth microdilution method. Multilevel regression models were used to compare antimicrobial susceptibility between isolates from small- and medium-scale farms. Results All farms included in the study administered antimicrobials to their sows. Small-scale farmers most commonly (64 %) decided themselves when to give antimicrobials and the majority (60 %) bought the medicines at the local store or pharmacy, whereas farmers on medium-scale farms always discussed antimicrobial treatment with a veterinarian. Medium-scale farms used a greater diversity of antimicrobials than small-scale farms and did also administer antimicrobials in feed to a higher extent. High levels of antimicrobial resistance to several <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> for human medicine (including ciprofloxacin, streptomycin and ampicillin) were found in isolates from both small- and medium-scale farms. Resistance levels were significantly (P <  0. 05) higher in isolates from medium-scale farms for several of the antimicrobials tested, as well as the level of multidrug-resistance (P =  0. 026). Conclusion The routines regarding access and administration of antimicrobials differed between the small- and medium-scale farms. Although the level of antimicrobial resistance, as well as multidrug-resistance, was higher in isolates from medium-scale farms, it cannot be concluded if this increase is a consequence of a more abundant use of antimicrobials, or a result of differences in administration routines...|$|R
40|$|Background Antimicrobial use in {{livestock}} production {{is an important}} contemporary issue, which is of public interest worldwide. Antimicrobials are not freely available to Austrian farmers and can only be administered to livestock by veterinarians, or by farmers who are trained members of the Animal Health Service. Since 2015, veterinarians have been {{required by law to}} report antimicrobials dispensed to farmers for use in food-producing animals. The study presented here went further than the statutory framework, and collected data on antimicrobials dispensed to farmers and those administered by veterinarians. Methods Seventeen veterinary practices were enrolled in the study via convenience sampling. These veterinarians were asked to contact interested dairy farmers regarding participation in the study (respondent-driven sampling). Data were collected from veterinary practice software between 1 st October 2015 and 30 th September 2016. Electronic data (89. 4 %) were transferred via an online interface and paper records (10. 6 %) were entered by the authors. Antimicrobial treatments with respect to udder disease were analysed by number of defined daily doses per cow and year (nDDDvet/cow/year), based on the European Medicines Agency technical unit, Defined Daily Dose for animals (DDDvet). Descriptive statistics and the Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to analyse the results. Results Antimicrobial use data from a total of 248 dairy farms were collected during the study, 232 of these farms treated cows with antibiotics; dry cow therapy was excluded from the current analysis. The mean number of DDDvet/cow/year for the antimicrobial treatment of all udder disease was 1. 33 DDDvet/cow/year. Of these treatments, 0. 73 DDDvet/cow/year were classed as highest priority <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> (HPCIAs), according to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition. The Wilcoxon rank sum test determined a statistically significant difference between the median number of DDDvet/cow/year for acute and chronic mastitis treatment (W = 10, 734, p <  0. 001). The most commonly administered antimicrobial class for the treatment of acute mastitis was beta-lactams. Intramammary penicillin was used at a mean of 0. 63 DDDvet/cow/year, followed by the third generation cephalosporin, cefoperazone, (a HPCIA) at 0. 60 DDDvet/cow/year. Systemic antimicrobial treatments were used at a lower overall level than intramammary treatments for acute mastitis. Discussion This study demonstrated that Austrian dairy cows in the study population were treated with antimicrobial substances for udder diseases at a relatively low frequency, however, a substantial proportion of these treatments were with substances considered <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> for human health. While it is vital that sick cows are treated, reductions in the overall use of <b>antimicrobials,</b> and <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> substances in particular, are still possible...|$|R
40|$|Resistance {{to third}} and fourth {{generation}} cephalosporins is rapidly increasing in bacteria infecting humans. Although many of these problems are linked to {{human to human transmission}} and to use of antimicrobials in human medicine, the potential role of community reservoirs such as food producing animals needs to be scrutinized. Resistance to {{third and fourth}} generation cephalosporins is emerging in enteric bacteria of food producing animals and also in food of animal origin. The genes encoding resistance to these cephalosporins are transferrable and often linked to other resistance genes. Systemic use of third and fourth cephalosporins selects for resistance, but co-selection by other antimicrobials is also likely to influence prevalence of resistance. Although there are many uncertainties, the potential consequences of a further increase of resistance to this <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> class of <b>antimicrobials</b> in bacteria colonising animals are serious. Measures to counter a further increase and spread of resistance among animals should therefore be considered...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) is {{a global}} health problem, and emerging semi-intensive farming systems in Southeast Asia are major contributors to the AMR burden. We accessed 12 pig and chicken farms at key stages of production in Tien Giang Province, Vietnam, to measure antimicrobial usage and to investigate the prevalence of AMR to five critical antimicrobials (β-lactams, third-generation cephalosporins, quinolones, aminoglycosides, and polymyxins) and their corresponding molecular mechanisms among 180 Escherichia coli isolates. Overall, 94. 7 mg (interquartile range [IQR], 65. 3 to 151. 1) and 563. 6 mg (IQR, 398. 9 to 943. 6) of antimicrobials was used to produce 1 kg (live weight) of chicken and pig, respectively. A median of 3 (out of 8) critical antimicrobials were used on pig farms. E. coli isolates exhibited a high prevalence of resistance to ampicillin (97. 8 % and 94. 4 % for chickens and pigs, respectively), ciprofloxacin (73. 3 % and 21. 1 %), gentamicin (42. 2 % and 35. 6 %), and colistin (22. 2 % and 24. 4 %). The prevalence of a recently discovered colistin resistance gene, mcr- 1, was 19 to 22 % and had strong agreement with phenotypic colistin resistance. We conducted plasmid conjugation experiments with 37 mcr- 1 gene-positive E. coli isolates and successfully observed transfer of the gene in 54. 0 % of isolates through a plasmid of approximately 63 kb, consistent with one recently identified in China. We found no significant correlation between total use of antimicrobials at the farm level and AMR. These data provide additional insight {{into the role of}} mcr- 1 in colistin resistance on farms and outline the dynamics of phenotypic and genotypic AMR in semi-intensive farming systems in Vietnam. Our study provides accurate baseline information on levels of antimicrobial use, {{as well as on the}} dynamics of phenotypic and genotypic resistance for antimicrobials of critical importance among E. coli over the different stages of production in emerging pig and poultry production systems in Vietnam. E. coli isolates showed a high prevalence of resistance (> 20 %) to <b>critically</b> <b>important</b> <b>antimicrobials,</b> such as colistin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin. The underlying genetic mechanisms identified for colistin (the mcr- 1 gene) and quinolone (gyrA gene mutations) are likely to play a major role in AMR to those compounds. Conjugation experiments led to the identification of a 63 -kb plasmid, similar to one recently identified in China, as the potential carrier of the mcr- 1 gene. These results should encourage greater restrictions of such antimicrobials in Southeast Asian farming system...|$|R
