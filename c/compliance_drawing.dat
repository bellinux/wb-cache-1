40|$|We {{explored}} the moderating roles of legitimate and coercive power {{held by the}} tax authority {{in the relationship between}} procedural justice, trust in the tax authority, and voluntary tax <b>compliance.</b> <b>Drawing</b> from fairness heuristic theory and the slippery slope framework of tax compliance, we predicted that procedural justice fosters voluntary tax compliance, particularly when legitimate power of the tax authority is low and when coercive power of the authority is high. Moreover, we predicted that these interactive effects are mediated by (cognition-based) trust. Finally, we predicted that coercive power of the tax authority is positively related with enforced tax compliance. The results of a field study among Ethiopian business owners supported most predictions.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the recoupling mechanism of campaign-style enforcement {{and its effects on}} environmental regulatory <b>compliance.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on the policy implementation literature and institutional theory, the authors develop a conceptual model of campaign-style enforcement in which both resource mobilization and power redistribution are theorized to address decoupling problems in regulatory compliance. The two-pathway recoupling mechanism is evidenced by an empirical investigation of the implementation of China's energy conservation and emission reduction policy as part of that country's 11 th Five-Year Plan. Findings suggest that campaign-style enforcement can effectively improve regulatory compliance when it addresses the efficiency/legitimacy conflict by providing policy incentives and reorganizing a clear hierarchy of political authority. The article concludes with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of campaign-style enforcement. Department of Management and Marketin...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} an {{effective}} legal compliance system for an organization requires skill at predicting human behavior. The surveillance portion of compliance involves estimates about who {{is most likely to}} misbehave, and when. The communicative aspect—training and guidance—requires thinking about what kinds of messages and incentives are most effective. Forensics and resolution are about, at least in part, learning from the experience and applying the lessons to future activity. It’s entirely plausible to use the economist’s assumption of rational choice—opportunism with guile—in making these predictions. But the realism of that assumption has been under attack for decades now.

Government, business and unions in the United States have insisted that Chinese law needs to be reformed {{to deal with those}} abuses but they fail to identify precisely what reforms are required. This article aims to shift debates about reforming Chinese labor law in the United States to a much greater level of specificity. The discussion focuses on two very prevalent abuses that are purportedly prohibited by existing labor regulation: underpayment of wages and excessive working hours. The article analyses in detail those aspects of China’s labor laws and labor institutions contributing to pervasive non-compliance. I find that the Chinese regulatory framework is undermined by a profusion of imprecise and sometimes contradictory legal rules, a bureaucratic ‘command and control’ approach to inspection and dispute resolution, and a narrow and ineffective range of tools for inducing <b>compliance.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on successful international examples of regulatory innovation, as well as recent creative Chinese experiments in labor enforcement, I propose a range of regulatory initiatives that have realistic prospects of inducing greater adherence to the law in China’s current political and economic context...|$|E

Time and attendance software enables employers to record employees 2 ̆ 7 hours worked, breaks taken, and related data to determine compensation.

Software could enable transparency, but when it serves to obfuscate instead, it misses an opportunity to reduce costly legal risk for employers and protect employee rights.

40|$|This project {{examines}} the untapped area of international legal engagement and the dynamic ways that states use treaty actions {{as a means}} of communication. This project focuses on two central questions: 1) What explains when and why states engage with treaty law 2) What effect, if any, does engagement have on compliance levels? I argue that involvement of the domestic legislature at the ratification and implementation stages helps explain legal engagement via commitment and post-commitment actions. Timing of legal actions influences observed compliance levels. I use a multi-methods approach to address these questions. First, I collect the legal treaty actions made towards each of the core United Nations human rights treaties. Statistical analyses examine the role commitment actions have in compliance levels with treaty law. I specifically focus on the ICCPR and CEDAW treaties for empirical analysis of <b>compliance,</b> <b>drawing</b> on other human rights treaties for comparative analysis. Drawing from the cases of the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, I examine the role of domestic legislatures on international legal behavior. In the end the timing and amount of legislative involvement in the treaty process have major consequences for how, when, and how frequently states engage with international law. States confronting legislative barriers to ratification tend to sign treaties earlier than states without barriers. For these states signature, not ratification, becomes the significant and defining point of human rights behavior change. 2018 - 02 - 0...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2007. This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} question of why states comply with some international norms more than others.

I find that existing theories of International Relations and Japan Studies are ill equipped to explain these variations in <b>compliance.</b> Instead, I <b>draw</b> from scholarship on ideas and politics to argue that Japan's compliance with international norms is filtered through domestic elite debates about the nature of national identity.

A multidisciplinary model for explaining <b>compliance</b> is presented, <b>drawing</b> from criminal theory, economics, social psychology and public purchasing. The impact on compliance is quantified, using survey data from purchasing professionals of the Dutch Ministry of Defence.

40|$|Ever since Grotius first {{suggested}} that desire for esteem from the broader global community motivates States {{to comply with}} international law, identifying just how this desire effects compliance has proven illusive. The ability to harness the pull of international society is important to virtually all treaty formation and compliance. It is especially important {{in the area of}} human rights regimes where other compliance forces such as coercion, are rarely, if ever, used. Recent empirical evidence, however, suggests that human rights regimes are ineffective. Indeed, in many situations this evidence suggests that the human rights practices of States that ratify such treaties may actually worsen after ratification. The need to understand how, or whether, the pull of international society influences state behavior, thus, has never been greater. This Article provides an initial detailed model of the forces motivating human rights treaty creation and <b>compliance</b> by <b>drawing</b> on evolving expressive law literature. It begins by setting forth a need-reinforcement model that explains how normative pressure influences rational actors to alter their behavior and beliefs while seeking regard from other group members. Next, the Article applies this model to State treaty ratification and compliance, and describes how treaties exert expressive effects that lead rational States to change their behavior because of their desire to be part of and esteemed by the global community. The Article then demonstrates how this expressive theory harmonizes the contributions of divergent international law scholars into a more complete theory of why States enter into and obey international law. In doing so, it provides a framework from which regime design implications can be draw...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{development}} of e-government has exposed critical public {{information to the}} possibility of cybercrime. Information security has become a critical issue that needs to be adequately addressed in e-government development. This paper develops an information security <b>compliance</b> model by <b>drawing</b> insights from organizational and institutional theory literature to examine how organizational security culture influences information security compliance in public organizations for e-government development. It also investigates the role of social pressure in moderating the relationship between information security culture and information security compliance. The study explores three specific dimensions of information security culture: management commitments, accountability and information security awareness. The result of a hierarchical regression analysis indicates that management commitments, accountability, information security awareness, and social pressure have a significant positive impact on information security compliance in public organizations. The moderating role of social pressure, however, is only significant in augmenting the relationship between accountability and information security compliance. This study contributes to the information security compliance research by highlighting the criticality of establishing an information security culture within public organisations to promote information security compliance...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} how {{to establish}} respect for labour rights. It aims {{to inform the}} analysis of compliance problems and create a diagnostic approach to implementing labour rights. The {{ultimate goal is to}} provide insight into the interventions necessary to progressively implement labour rights as defined in international law. The project creates a conceptual framing of labour rights by joining two theoretical approaches: institutions theory and <b>compliance</b> theory. <b>Drawing</b> on institutions theory from political economy, the thesis reframes labour rights regulations, as holistic institutions comprised of rules, norms and actual behaviours, the so-called ‘rules of the game’ in employment. In this context, problems in implementing labour rights are understood as employment practices that are embedded in a web of formal and informal rules governing work within society. Once, reframed in institutional terms, employment practices that violate labour rights can then be analyzed and shortcomings identified using compliance theory. Compliance theory is well suited to institutional approaches because it, like institutions theory treats norms, rules and behaviours as critical components in achieving compliance. The thesis integrates the framework into a diagnostic methodology and tool for comparison of labour rights compliance among the countries that are parties to the Dominican Republic, Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). It applies the methodology to two cases. The first case examines obligatory overtime and trafficking and the second focuses on freedom of association. The analyses are based on publicly available documentary evidence from distinct perspectives such as the International Confederation of Trade Unions (ICFTU), the United States State Department Human Rights Reports and ILO Committee of Experts reports and observations. The thesis concludes that the diagnostic methodology can help to uncover institutional patterns associated with labour rights compliance problems as well as problems with the international legal norms themselves...|$|R
40|$|Unlike tax {{accountants}} and advisors within direct tax, Customs law {{in many countries}} requires importers to employ licensed Customs agents. This study extends the tax literature by examining the role of Customs agents in import tax compliance. In Malaysia, {{as an example of}} a country where Customs are responsible for about one-third (MYR 30 billion on average between 2005 to 2014) of total government revenue collections, the function of Customs agents is to: assist importers in meeting their import tax liabilities; prepare and submit all necessary import documentation to Customs; as well as collect and pay all revenue to the Customs administration. Customs agents are bound by the Customs Act 1967 and are required to pass a public exam before becoming formally qualified and licensed Customs agents. Exploratory interviews with senior Customs officers at The Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) suggest that a significant amount of tax revenue is lost because Customs agents do not pay the full amount of import duty and tax due. Most interviewed officers felt that tougher penalties and sanctions are required to improve compliance and root-out fraud; though some indicated that other measures may need to be developed in order to improve <b>compliance</b> practice. <b>Drawing</b> on the tax compliance literature within the direct tax domain, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) has been identified as one of the most robust social cognitive theories to explain compliance decision making.

We used a grounded theory approach to explore service users and providers experiences of risk assessment and management. We interviewed forensic mental health service users and providers. We also collected data using participant and non-participant observation. Since access to forensic mental health services is tightly controlled, there are participant observation studies undertaken in these settings.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} tax penalties and tax <b>compliance.</b> Conventional accounts, <b>drawing</b> from deterrence theory and norms theory, assume that the relationship is purely instrumental [...] that the function of tax penalties is solely to promote tax compliance. This paper identifies {{another aspect of the}} relationship that generally has been overlooked by the existing literature: the function of tax penalties in defining tax compliance. Tax penalties determine the standards of conduct that satisfy a taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s obligations to the government; they distinguish compliant taxpayers from non-compliant taxpayers. This paper argues that tax compliance in a self-assessment system should require the taxpayer to report her tax liabilities only on the basis of legal positions that she reasonably and in good faith believes to be correct. However, the accuracy penalties provided under current law set much lower standards of conduct. In the case of a non-abusive transaction, current law allows the taxpayer to base her self-assessment on a position having as little as a one-in-five chance of prevailing; for an abusive transaction, the taxpayer only needs a reasonable belief that her position is more likely than not to prevail. The paper describes reformed standards of conduct for taxpayers, tax practitioners, and government officials that define tax compliance more appropriately for a self-assessment system...|$|R

The underlying issues that fuel the increase in the imprisonment of fine defaulters in Ireland are unknown. The present study explored individual experiences and interactions of fined offenders with the criminal justice system in order to identify barriers to <b>compliance.</b> By <b>drawing</b> on instrumental and normative models of compliance identified in the literature, and by utilizing data gathered from 40 in-depth interviews and 103 questionnaires with offenders who have paid fines as well as offenders who have defaulted on fines, the following research questions were addressed: (1) What role do financial means play in fine default? (2) Are there other factors working in opposition to or in tandem with financial means? (3) Are there practices within the criminal justice system that inhibit or facilitate the enforcement and payment of fines? (4) Do offenders perceive the criminal fine process as fair and equitable, and what impact do those perceptions have on shaping compliance / noncompliance? (5) Is imprisonment the primary deterrent factor among those who pay their fine, or are there other factors that influence compliance? The research revealed that while affordability plays a primary role in whether a fine is paid or not, other legal and extralegal factors also contribute to fine default, such as personal and family needs, forgetfulness or low priority, and the inability to negotiate and understand the criminal fine system. Overall there was a general sense of unfairness and dissatisfaction with the system [...] a dissatisfaction that was fairly consistent among both those who paid and did not pay their fines. Also, it would appear that for many, prison is not a deterrent factor when it comes to the enforcement of fines and for those who do pay, the fear of prison is not the primary reason for compliance...|$|R
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 226 - 252). Fisheries compliance {{theory has}} evolved {{over the past two}} decades in an attempt to understand the factors that influence fishers’ behaviour and to develop appropriate strategies to enhance compliance. However, much of this research, which draws on both rationalist and normative perspectives, has largely focussed on the industrial fisheries. Empirical research on the small-scale fisheries sector, therefore, has been lacking. The overall aim of this thesis has been to develop a conceptual framework for understanding and addressing small-scale fisheries <b>compliance</b> by <b>drawing</b> on experiences in South Africa. This has been achieved through a detailed investigation of two small-scale fisheries case studies, as well as a review of the small-scale fisheries sector generally. The findings from this research have emphasised the need to rethink ourunderstanding of fisheries compliance in the small-scale sector. By drawing onempirical evidence, as well as the literature review, a conceptual framework has beendeveloped that enhances existing compliance theory. This study highlights that anunderstanding of compliance behaviour first requires a critical analysis of how lawhas evolved, its history and the power dynamics that have shaped it. The conceptualframework further emphasises the need to understand compliance within a fisherysystem, acknowledging that social, economic, institutional and biophysical factors allimpact on whether or not fishers’ comply with rules and laws. By applying theconceptual framework to two case studies in South Africa, key drivers that influencefisher behaviour over time are identified and changes within the fishery system areanalysed and documented. This thesis has also contributed to fisheries compliancetheory by identifying the underlying principles that are seen as necessary to guide an alternative and more integrated approach to small-scale fisheries compliance. In addition to the principles of legitimacy and deterrence, which are incorporated into existing theories of compliance, this study emphasises that the principle of social justice is required to develop a more holistic approach to understanding and addressing small-scale fisheries compliance. By embracing these principles, it is argued that fisheries policies will shift away from a sole reliance on criminal justice to achieve compliance, to a more integrated approach that aims to sustain the fishery system as a whole...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there are}} {{different}} notions of what legal norms sets apart from social norms, all concepts of law adhere {{to the principle of}} legal equality, according to which like cases are treated alike. Law thus requires that like cases are treated in a like manner. This, in turn, requires a high compliance rate with any given regulation. Without sufficient compliance rates, it is hardly possible to speak of law. But can a high degree of compliance be realized beyond the coercive capacities of the nation-state? The sceptical formulation of Herbert Kelsen (1966 : 4) is famous: "The antagonism of freedom and coercion fundamental to social life supplies the decisive criterion. It is the criterion of law, for law is a coercive order. " This point of view is also reflected in Realism as a theory of international relations (Morgenthau 1964, Waltz 1979). For Realism, legal constraints beyond the nation-state are non-existent or, at best, very weak (e. g. Krasner 1999 on human rights). Furthermore, communitarianists point out that questions of law and justice can meaningfully be dealt with only in communities that share common values and ideas (Goodin 1988, Miller 1995) and are equally doubtful about the possibility for law beyond the nation-state. In this sense, it seems fair to describe the question of compliance as the Achilles" heel of international regulations (see Werksmann 1996 : xvi, Young 1999 a: Chap. 4). This paper aims to shed doubt on the scepticism of Realism and Communitarianism. As opposed to the propositions of both theoretical strands we show that law beyond the nation-state is indeed possible and that compliance can even in a horizontal setting without centralized coercive capacities and without a single underlying social identity work sufficiently well. We furthermore show some of the building blocks of a successful elicitation of compliance beyond the nation-state and discuss if and in how far the EU is different from other international institutions in realising them. For developing this argument we start by introducing our research design and case selection (section 2). Section 3 introduces our empirical results, discusses their relevance for the analysis of <b>compliance</b> and <b>draws</b> some theoretical implications. This section is followed by a discussion of the relevance of the results for the study of European integration (section 4) ...|$|R

It applied an integrated and dynamic research approach, called descriptive analysis of compliance behavior, which integrated the three mainstreaming approaches, endogenous, exogenous and process approaches together. Moreover, this approach attempted {{to offer a}}n integrated view of compliance true to how it is experienced by the regulated actors, in terms of involving multiple laws that the regulated actors deal with in reality and analyzing the development of compliance over time, i. e. compliance changes in the business cycle from the start-up phase to daily operations. This research first described the compliance behavior variation in two diverse restaurants and captured the complexity of compliance, second explained why this variation in <b>compliance</b> exists. It <b>drawn</b> on existing <b>compliance</b> studies focused on regulatory, organizational, and individual influences to understand which of these were at play in the varied compliance behavior studied. It found that restaurants’ compliance behaviors are situated in their comprehensive legal knowledge, which deviated from the original written law and pointed to a different direction of compliance. Some organizational norms, including managerial, injunctive and descriptive norms, promote certain legally required behaviors, while some impede the compliance. At the individual level, both subjective explanations for their compliance behaviors and key individual compliance variables suggested in the exiting literature, including plural subjective deterrence, personal norms, descriptive norms, perceived obligation to obey the law, practical constraints, and recognition of legal requirement, are discussed and analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The {{parties to}} the UN climate {{negotiations}} have time and again failed to agree on ambitious emissions reductions targets that can prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system (UN, 1992, p. 9). Lately, state leaders and UN officials have expressed great hopes for finally reaching a universal and legally binding climate agreement at this year s meeting of the UNFCCC parties in Paris. Game-theoretical perspectives on climate negotiations tell another story. The UN climate negotiations are characterized as a Prisoners Dilemma where countries are better off free riding on the efforts of others. Thus, an effective climate agreement must ensure that countries incentives for participation and <b>compliance</b> be restructured. <b>Drawing</b> on the argument that climate change is a global public good, I argue that a club approach can achieve such restructuring under the right circumstances. Previous scholarly contributions {{in the field of}} club theory (mainly David Victor) propose climate clubs as a setting that enables countries willing to use own resources to combat climate change to coordinate their efforts and simultaneously create incentives for reluctant countries to participate. The analysis focuses on two types of incentives that enthusiastic countries might utilize in a club context, namely conditional commitments and club goods. Exploring various models and proposals of such incentives and using both primary and secondary sources, I aim to advance current knowledge concerning the prospects for effective climate cooperation through climate clubs. I argue that, it is the very ties between conditional commitments and club goods that might strengthen participation and compliance. I find that under the right circumstances, these incentives can successfully induce reluctant countries to follow suit. In particular, a club approach can help change the climate change mitigation game into a coordination game. However, I also find that a troubling U. S. -China relationship, risks of carbon leakage, processes of negative spillover into other multilateral efforts, existing trade laws, and protectionist concerns constitute substantial barriers for developing an effective climate club...|$|R

This practice-based project in speculative design explores possibilities for disrupting everyday constructs of reality, which are apparent in regulations of time, space and matter. These constructs underpin notions of predictability and universal validity. &# 8232;Hybridity and complexity challenge these concepts associated with scientific objectivity, instrumental rationality, and economic efficiency. Both notions are prevalent tropes in art and design practice, pointing out {{the discrepancy between the}} rigid order of classical science versus unruly reality. This ideological tension is constructively deployed in eight experimental projects that are located in the field of metrology, the science of measurement. By manipulating measuring devices, industrial standards and protocol <b>compliance</b> attention is <b>drawn</b> to alternative ways of engaging with the world. The practice-based component is a toolkit that consists of reconfigured measuring devices called Tools for Alternative Understandings, which use elasticity as a material and conceptual agent to provoke unconventional models of thought. With the intention to reconfigure established modes of knowledge production the toolkit provokes a shift towards material and performative modes of knowing beyond the representation a list thinking within modern Western culture. Such experimentation may trigger a change for more creative and viable futures fostering flexible approaches for meaning making. The practice is framed as an experimental laboratory that interrogates the regulations determined by current systems of measurement and representation. The experiments are guided by a theoretical framework that builds on material-semiotic approaches emphasizing the entanglement between human and non-human agencies as co-productive constituents in the construction of reality. Such ideas are inherent in the work of Karen Barad, Donna Haraway and Bruno Latour. In drawing on Barads reconceptualisation of measurement through the indeterminacy found in quantum physics, elasticity is presented as the fundamental component of the project. The application of Elastic Design is discussed using three focithe unlocking, redirecting and material re-entangling of rational procedures, and ideological concepts to cultivate alternative experiences of reality. Additional strategies associated with new materialism, science and technology studies, conceptual art and speculative design figure as supplements to my research methodology...|$|R
