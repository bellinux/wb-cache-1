5|$|Known {{methods for}} {{repeatedly}} finding the closest pair of clusters in a dynamic set of clusters either require superlinear space {{to maintain a}} data structure that can find closest pairs quickly, or they take greater than linear time to find each closest pair. The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm uses a smaller {{amount of time and}} space than the greedy algorithm by merging pairs of clusters in a different order. In this way, it avoids the problem of repeatedly finding closest pairs. Nevertheless, for many types of <b>clustering</b> <b>problem,</b> it can be guaranteed {{to come up with the}} same hierarchical clustering as the greedy algorithm despite the different merge order.|$|E
500|$|The same method {{also can}} be used as a {{subroutine}} when the individual cluster diameters are unknown. To test whether a given sum of diameters can be achieved without knowing the individual cluster diameters, one may try all maximal pairs of target diameters that add up to at most the given sum, representing each pair of diameters as a 2-satisfiability instance and using a 2-satisfiability algorithm to determine whether that pair can be realized by a clustering. To find the optimal sum of diameters one may perform a binary search in which each step is a feasibility test of this type. The same approach also works to find clusterings that optimize other combinations than sums of the cluster diameters, and that use arbitrary dissimilarity numbers (rather than distances in a metric space) to measure the size of a cluster. The time bound for this algorithm is dominated by the time to solve a sequence of 2-satisfiability instances that are closely related to each other, and [...] shows how to solve these related instances more quickly than if they were solved independently from each other, leading to a total time bound of [...] for the sum-of-diameters <b>clustering</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) {{is popular}} algo-rithm for {{unsupervised}} learning and visualization introduced by Teuvo Kohonen. One {{of the most}} attractive applications of SOM is clustering and several algorithms for various kinds of <b>clustering</b> <b>problems</b> have been reported and investigated. In this study, we propose {{a new type of}} SOM algorithm, which is called Fatigable SOM (FSOM) algorithm. The important feature of FSOM is that the neurons are fatigable, namely, the neurons which have become a winner can not become a winner during a certain period of time. Because of this feature, FSOM tends to self-organize only in the area where input data are concentrated. We investigate the behavior of FSOM and apply FSOM to <b>clustering</b> <b>problems.</b> Further, we introduce the fatigue level to FSOM to increase its flexibility for various kinds of <b>clustering</b> <b>problems.</b> The efficiencies of FSOM and the fatigue level are confirmed by several simulation results.
