5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been {{cyclical}} ice ages in which glacial sheets periodically covered the higher latitudes of the continents. Ice ages may occur because of changes in ocean circulation and continentality induced by plate tectonics. The Milankovitch theory predicts that glacial periods occur during ice ages because of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms. The primary astronomical drivers are a higher than normal orbital eccentricity, a low axial tilt (or obliquity), and the alignment of summer solstice with the aphelion. Each of these effects occur cyclically. For example, the eccentricity changes over time cycles of about 100,000 and 400,000 years, with the value ranging from less than 0.01 up to 0.05. This is equivalent to a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> semiminor axis of the planet's orbit from 99.95% of the semimajor axis to 99.88%, respectively.|$|E

The doctrine of transubstantiation was developed in the high Middle Ages to explain the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elements into Christ's body and blood. Transubstantiation is the belief that the Eucharistic elements are transformed into Christ's body and blood in a way only perceivable by the intellect, not by the senses.|$|E

5|$|Poliovirus infects {{human cells}} by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, CD155, (also {{known as the}} {{poliovirus}} receptor (PVR)) on the cell surface. Interaction of poliovirus and CD155 facilitates an irreversible conformational <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viral particle necessary for viral entry. Attached to the host cell membrane, entry of the viral nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via {{the formation of a}} pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then “injected” into the host cell cytoplasm, or that the virus is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Recent experimental evidence supports the latter hypothesis and suggests that poliovirus binds to CD155 and is taken up by endocytosis. Immediately after internalization of the particle, the viral RNA is released.|$|E

30|$|Perthes’ disease {{leads to}} typical {{anatomic}} <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femoral head [1, 2, 3]. In 1950, Heyman and Herndon emphasised that radiographic alteration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acetabulum plays {{a crucial role}} in <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease and they defined it as one of four major radiographic criteria to describe this condition [4]. In the last few decades, several authors have reported on radiographic <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acetabular anatomy, such as hypertrophy, retroversion, bicompartmental and dysplastic development [5, 6, 7].

5|$|The {{inductor}} is a conductor, {{usually a}} coil of wire, that stores energy in {{a magnetic field}} {{in response to the}} current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current. The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.|$|E
