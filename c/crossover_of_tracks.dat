Data were collected from a sample of 2, 108 couples from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring survey. Using structural equation modeling, the authors tested a crossover model that incorporated three mechanisms: bidirectional <b>crossover</b> <b>of</b> perceived health between spouses, common stressors (income), and indirect mediated effects (social undermining). The model showed an acceptable fit to the data and provided support for all three-crossover mechanisms. Furthermore, self-esteem mediated the relationship between eco-nomic hardship and perceived health.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} convincingly shown that employees' family lives can affect their work outcomes. We {{investigate}} whether family-to-work conflict (FWC) {{experienced by the}} employee also affects the turnover intention of a co-worker. We predict that the employee's FWC {{has an effect on}} the co-worker's turnover intention through the <b>crossover</b> <b>of</b> positive and negative work attitudes. Using a sample of 154 co-worker dyads, we found that the employee FWC was positively related to co-worker turnover intention through the <b>crossover</b> <b>of</b> (reduced) work engagement. Results show that family matters at work, affecting employee. In addition, employee's job engagement was positively related to his (her) co-worker job engagement and it was negatively related co-worker turnover intention and employee's FWC was not positively related to co-worker turnover intention trough the <b>crossover</b> <b>of</b> (reduced) feelings of engagement...|$|R
