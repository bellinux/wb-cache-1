40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Construction</b> <b>workers</b> in Hong Kong face high {{health risks}} of heat stress, solar {{ultraviolet}} radiation, and hazardous substances. A suitable work wear can lower exposure to these hazards, {{but the actual}} dressing behavior of <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: Thisstudy examines the current dressing patterns of <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> and evaluates their limitations. METHODS: The dressing patterns of <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> were investigated through unconcealed videotaped observation and questionnaire survey to enhance {{the reliability and validity}} of this research. RESULTS: Results indicate that <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> were willing to wear short-sleeved shirts for a cooler feeling, although such dressing patterns may not protect them against solar ultraviolet radiation or hazardous substances. Their preferred dark-colored long pants can decrease the direct exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation and hazardous substances, but they absorb a large amount of radiation heat that increases the hazards of heat stress to the wearers. CONCLUSIONS: Thermal-related attributes were the most significant concerns of <b>construction</b> <b>workers,</b> which serve as key elements for designing appropriate work clothes for <b>construction</b> <b>workers.</b> Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Working {{on large}} scale {{construction}} sites {{have been shown}} to have severe health consequences in terms of increased risk of hospitalization and disability retirement compared to construction work in general. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether large scale construction work involving 12 -h workdays and extended workweeks leads to insufficient recovery measured as increased catabolic and decreased anabolic metabolism. METHODS: The study group comprised 40 male <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> of which 21 had 12 -h workdays and extended workweeks (56 h/workweek). The comparison group consisted of 19 male <b>construction</b> <b>workers,</b> who worked regular hours (37 h/week, weekends off). Measurements of concentrations of cortisol in saliva and free testosterone and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1 c)) in blood were made in a repeated measures design during 2 workweeks for both groups supplemented with 1 week off for <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> with extended workweeks. RESULTS: The diurnal profile of concentrations of salivary cortisol for <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> with extended workweeks differed from the diurnal profile of salivary cortisol for those with regular work schedules (P < 0. 001). The <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> with extended workweeks tended to have 15 % [95 % CI - 3 %; 37 %] higher concentrations of free testosterone in serum compared to <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> with regular work schedules (P = 0. 09). There were no differences between the two groups with respect to concentrations of HbA(1 c). There was no increasing trend in concentrations of cortisol or decreasing trend in concentrations of testosterone during the extended workweek. The diurnal profile for concentrations of cortisol differed between workdays and days off for <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> with extended workweeks (P = 0. 003). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we observed no indications of insufficient recovery in terms of increased catabolic or decreased anabolic metabolism in <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> with 12 -h workdays and extended workweeks compared to <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> with regular work schedules...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} study, a survey on {{subjective}} symptoms and hot prevention measures in summer {{was conducted in}} 204 male traffic control workers and 115 male <b>construction</b> <b>workers.</b> Work loads of traffic control <b>workers</b> and <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> were estimated at RMR 1 – 2 and RMR 2 – 4, respectively. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on age, occupational career, working habit, present or past history of diseases, individual preventive measures to the heat, and subjective symptoms in the summer. Daily working hours in the sunshine of the traffic control workers were significantly longer {{than those of the}} <b>construction</b> <b>workers.</b> Prevalence rates of changing clothes frequently, avoiding direct exposure of face and neck to sunlight using towel like materials, and wearing sunglasses in the traffic control workers were significantly lower than the <b>construction</b> <b>workers.</b> Prevalence rates of symptoms in the upper extremities in the traffic control workers were significantly lower than those in the <b>construction</b> <b>workers.</b> Prevalence of work difficulty due to hot weather during work in the traffic control workers was significantly lower than the <b>construction</b> <b>workers.</b> On the basis of the results obtained, some preventive countermeasures to improve working environment are presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{nutrition}} of <b>construction</b> <b>workers</b> {{appears to}} be understudied despite anecdotal evidence that {{suggests that it is}} closely linked to health and safety (H&S) performance and productivity of the <b>workers</b> on <b>construction</b> sites. The objective {{of this paper is to}} identify possible worksite interventions to improve the nutrition of <b>construction</b> <b>workers.</b> A review of literature based on both South African and international context was conducted from journal, conference proceedings, books, magazines, theses and dissertations. Findings revealed that supplementary feeding programmes, nutrition education and environmental and/organizational changes could beget better nutritional behaviour among <b>construction</b> <b>workers,</b> whose food choices comprise mainly of fast-foods and fizzy drinks.

He then used stairways to get to the 104th floor, walked past a sleeping security guard, and climbed up a ladder to get to the antenna, where he took pictures for two hours. The elevator operator was reassigned, and the guard was fired. It was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower, which facilitated Casquejo's entry to the site.|$|E
