5|$|Horses are {{frequently}} seen in television, films and literature. They are sometimes featured {{as a major}} character in films about particular animals, but also used as visual elements that assure the accuracy of historical stories. Both live horses and iconic images of horses are used in advertising to promote a variety of products. The horse frequently appears in coats of arms in heraldry, {{in a variety of}} poses and equipment. The mythologies of many cultures, including Greco-Roman, Hindu, Islamic, and Norse, include references to both normal horses and those with wings or additional limbs, and multiple myths also <b>call</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> horse to draw the chariots of the Moon and Sun. The horse also appears in the 12-year cycle of animals in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar.|$|E
5|$|In Roman {{constitutional}} law, the assemblies are {{a sovereign}} authority, {{with the power}} to enact or reject any law, confer any magistracies, and make any decision. In fact, with a single law, they held the authority to override the norms and precedents of the Republic as well as ancient laws long unchanged. There are two necessary components to any assembly: (1) the convening magistrate and (2) the citizens in the assembly itself. Assemblies did not participate or discuss matters laid before them, they heard the speakers put forth by the presiding officer. And after such discussion, the presiding officer could call for a direct up or down vote. Without a magistrate, there would be nobody to legally <b>call</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> assembly; and without the citizens, there is naught but a magistrate.|$|E
5|$|Asad was apprised {{of this on}} {{the evening}} of 7 December, when {{messages}} arrived at Balkh that the Turgesh and their allies, some 30,000 strong, were at Jazza. Asad ordered signal fires to be lit and mobilized his Syrian troops, although he had to pay each man twenty dirhams to persuade them to fight. The Umayyad governor initially refused to <b>call</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> help of the local Khurasani Arabs, indicating the level of mistrust existing by now between the latter and the representatives of the Umayyad regime; in the end, however, he relented, and gathered a force of 7,000 men. In the meantime, Suluk attacked Khulm, but after being repelled marched on to Peroz Nakhsher/Peroz Bakhshin. Bypassing Balkh, the Turgesh seized the capital of Juzjan, and then dispersed and sent out mounted raiding parties in all directions, with some reaching as far as Marw al-Rudh. This was possibly done in search of forage, since such a large army could not otherwise be sustained during the winter. Against the expectations of Ibn Surayj, however, the ruler of Juzjan elected to side with Asad, who, informed of these events by the governor of Khulm, set out to engage the Turgesh.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Triet's 1,200-strong {{regiment}} {{was joined}} by 200 soldiers from the C1 Company of Rear Service Group 83—under the command of Captain Nguyen Van Lam—and {{they set up a}} three-sided ambush and waited for the arrival of a reported U.S. battalion. At around 8:00am on the morning of October 17, the 2nd Battalion departed from their night defensive position with Alpha Company in the lead followed by the Battalion Command Group, and the tail of the formation was covered by Delta Company. Bravo Company stayed behind to protect the battalion's base, along with the mortar sections of Alpha and Delta Companies. In accordance with the 1st Brigade's policy, Allen personally led his unit out as part of the Battalion Command Group, although he preferred to supervise actions from a helicopter. For artillery support, Alpha Company was authorized to <b>call</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> 105mm and 155mm howitzers located at Fire Support Bases Caisson V, Caisson III-S and Lorraine III.|$|E
5|$|The new Vandalic Kingdom of Carthage, {{under the}} capable king Geiseric, {{immediately}} launched raids against {{the coasts of}} Italy and Greece, even sacking and plundering Rome in 455. The Vandal raids continued unabated {{over the next two}} decades, despite repeated Roman attempts to defeat them. The Western Empire was impotent, its navy having dwindled to almost nothing, but the eastern emperors could still <b>call</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> resources and naval expertise of the eastern Mediterranean. A first Eastern expedition in 448, however, went no further than Sicily, and in 460, the Vandals attacked and destroyed a Western Roman invasion fleet at Cartagena in Spain. Finally, in 468, a huge Eastern expedition was assembled under Basiliscus, reputedly numbering 1,113 ships and 100,000 men, but it failed disastrously. About 600 ships were lost to fire ships, and the financial cost of 130,000 pounds of gold and 700 000 pounds of silver nearly bankrupted the Empire. This forced the Romans {{to come to terms with}} Geiseric and sign a peace treaty. After Geiseric's death in 477, however, the Vandal threat receded.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, ex-Sultan of Riau-Lingga, Sultan Mahmud IV Muzaffar Shah went to Terengganu from Bangkok on a Siamese vessel. The British {{requested}} that the ex-Sultan to be withdrawn because the British accused the ex-Sultan and also the Sultan of Terengganu, Sultan Omar of supporting Wan Ahmad. Wan Ahmad had constantly attacked Pahang using Kemaman as his base and British trade there were disrupted by the constant attacks. The Siamese agreed to British request, but {{they have yet to}} follow through with their agreement. The Strait Settlements Governor, Sir Orfeur Cavenagh sent three ships, HMS Scout, HMS Coquette and a steamer Tonze to Kuala Terengganu, under the command of Captain Corbett, accompanied by Major MacPherson. They were sent with orders to compel the ex-Sultan of Riau-Lingga to be sent back by the British to Siam, and to <b>call</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> Sultan to cease supporting Wan Ahmad. After the Sultan of Terengganu declined to surrender the ex-Sultan to the British, the ships bombarded Kuala Terengganu. The Sultan of Terengganu and the ex-Sultan had fled Kuala Terengganu during the bombardment. The ships then returned to Singapore. Kuala Terengganu was ravaged by a fire in 1882. The fire that swept through Kuala Terengganu destroyed many buildings, including Green Palace (Istana Hijau), the Sultan’s palace. Maziah Palace (Istana Maziah) was later built to replace the destroyed palace.|$|E

25|$|In fact, barren mothers often <b>call</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> {{spirit to}} cure their affliction. Many traditions hold that Mami Wata herself is barren, so if she gives a woman a child, that woman {{inherently}} becomes more distanced from the spirit's true nature. The woman will thus {{be less likely}} to become wealthy or attractive through her devotion to Mami Wata. Images of women with children often decorate shrines to the spirit.|$|E
25|$|The ship channel {{provides}} a seaway {{for the few}} annual re-supply vessels and research ships which <b>call</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> extraordinarily remote seaport at McMurdo Station. Preparation for the supply ships’ arrival includes icebreakers maintaining a uniform edge on the seaward side of the pier. The ship’s skipper maneuvers the icebreaker to use its bow as a giant battering ram to scarf or shave jagged edges from the pier to facilitate ships tying up at the dock.|$|E

The {{most important aspect of}} air support was probably the Combat Cargo Task Force, which included both British and American squadrons of transport aircraft, in particular the ubiquitous C47. Fourteenth Army required 7,000 sorties by transport aircraft every day during the maximum intensity of the fighting.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{there is}} a range of ulterior motives for Israel's denial of Palestinian statehood. If Palestine were {{declared}} a state, then immediately, Israel, by its present occupation of the West Bank will be in breach of the United Nations Charter. Palestine, as a state, could legitimately <b>call</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> inherent right of individual or collective self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter to remove Israel from the occupied territories. Palestine, as a state, {{would be able to}} accede to international conventions and bring legal action against Israel on various matters. Palestine could accede to various international human rights instruments, such as the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It could even join the International Criminal Court and file cases against Israel for war crimes. It would be a tinderbox of a situation that is highly likely to precipitate conflict in the Middle East.|$|E
