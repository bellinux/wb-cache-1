40|$|This {{investigation}} examines {{cell proliferation}} in the pancreas of the Syrian golden hamster. Three main themes are pursued. First, normal pancreatic {{growth and development}} is reviewed. Emphasis is placed on histogenesis and trophic stimuli. Secondly, modulation of pancreatic growth is examined. A new method for producing partial pancreatic duct obstruction using a technique of <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrapping</b> is described. The histologic alterations induced by wrapping {{are the same as}} those associated with the early changes of chemical pancreatic carcinogenesis [...] duct epithelial hyperplasia, metaplasia and nesidioblastosis. Morphometric, immunocytochemical, autoradiographic and G. I. hormone analysis are also utilized to characterize this model. Importantly, experimental nesidioblastosis can result in islets which are functionally capable of reversing streptozocin-induced diabetes. Thirdly, aberrant pancreatic growth was investigated in relation to carcinogenesis. Clinical cancer epidemiology is reviewed with special reference to risk factors and postulated trophic influences. Experimentally, the trophic effects of diet, cholecystectomy and duct obstruction were investigated. Finally a new model for the induction of carcinoma of the head of the pancreas, using <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrapping</b> in association with a chemical carcinogen, is presented...|$|R

50|$|Strong, direct {{sunlight}} or incandescent light can adversely react with phenolic compounds in wine and create potential wine faults. Delicate, light-bodied white wines run {{the greatest risk}} from light exposure, and for that reason, they are often packaged in darkly tinted wine bottles that offer some protection from the light. Wines packaged in clear, light green and blue colored bottles are the most vulnerable to light, and may need extra precautions for storage. For example, the Champagne house of Louis Roederer uses <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrap</b> to protect its premium cuvee Cristal from light, the wine being packaged in a clear bottle. In the cellar, wines are stored in corrugated boxes or wooden crates to protect the wines from direct light.|$|R

50|$|Fat Day's {{original}} inception as {{a standard}} guitar/bass/drums/vocals punk band has always been infused with a performance art aesthetic. They {{have been known to}} play dressed only in clear <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrap</b> or have vocalist Matt Pakulski locked inside a speaker cabinet for the entire duration of a live show. Their 1997 tour of the UK and Ireland featured a fifth member playing saxophone that drew comparisons to Captain Beefheart, and for their 1998 tour of the U.S and Japan the band built a set of oscillators that were activated by choreographed dances on four small trampolines. These homemade electronic instruments were later condensed into a more manageable helmet form that the band would wear and play songs on in the midst of their more guitar-based set.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear when Songs: Ohia became Magnolia Electric Co. In interviews, Jason Molina claimed that he {{considered}} the tenure of Songs: Ohia over after Didn't It Rain, which would make Magnolia Electric Co. the eponymous debut album under the new name. The name [...] "Songs: Ohia" [...] appears nowhere on the artwork of the album and only a promotional sticker on the <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrapping</b> connects it with the prior name. Nevertheless, Secretly Canadian still promotes the album under the Songs: Ohia moniker. On the other hand, the Magnolia Electric Co. live album Trials and Errors was recorded on April 16, 2003 at the Ancienne Belgique club in Brussels, {{at a time when}} the band was still touring under the Songs: Ohia name. Pitchfork Media later reported that name change would be made official after the Spanish tour in October 2003.|$|R

40|$|We have {{established}} a model in which <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrapping</b> induces reiteration of the normal ontogeny of beta-cell differentiation from ductal tissue. The secretion of insulin is physiologic and coordinated {{to the needs of}} the animal. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes in hamsters can be "cured" at least half the time. There appears to be activation of growth factor(s) within the pancreas, acting in an autocrine, paracrine, or juxtacrine manner to induce ductal cell proliferation and differentiation into functioning beta cells. Given the results of our studies to date, it does not seem premature to envisage new approaches to the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Identification of the factor(s) regulating islet-cell proliferation and differentiation in our model may permit islets to be grown in culture. This concept could be extended to induce endocrine cell differentiation in vitro as well. Furthermore, islet-cell growth factors could be used to provide "trophic support" to islet transplants as a means of maintaining graft viability. There may also be greater scope for gene therapy when the growth factor(s) have been isolated, purified, sequenced, and cloned...|$|R

40|$|Hypertension in Page (cellophane-wrapped) kidney {{is due to}} {{interstitial}} nephritis. BackgroundCellophane wrapping of {{the kidneys}} (Page kidney) induces perinephrits and hypertension, assumed {{to be due to}} renal ischemia resulting from parenchymal compression by the fibrous hull surrounding the kidneys. We investigated if interstitial nephritis, rather than plasma angiotensin activity, {{played a role in the}} development of hypertension in the Page kidney modelMethodsWe followed for 7 weeks rats with bilateral <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrapping</b> of the kidneys that received 20 mg/kg/day of the immunosuppressive antiproliferative drug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (two-kidney wrap/MMF) (N = 10) or vehicle (two-kidney wrap) (N = 10), and sham-operated rats (N = 10). ResultsThe two-kidney wrap group had progressive increment in blood pressure, inflammatory damage occupying 25 % to 50 % of the renal tubulointerstitial region and increased number of angiotensin II-positive cells, angiotensin II content, and oxidative stress in the kidney. MMF treatment prevented the development of hypertension and renal inflammation without modifying the perinephritic hull or the increment it induced in the intrarenal pressure. The plasma levels of angiotensin II were similar in the two-kidney wrap group, the two-kidney wrap/MMF group and the sham-operated animals and unchanged from baseline, despite the blood pressure increase in the two-kidney wrap group. ConclusionOur results indicate that renal wrap hypertension is unrelated to plasma angiotensin II levels and related to the inflammatory damage caused by the external compression of the kidney...|$|R

40|$|Induction of islet {{neogenesis}} by <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrapping</b> (CW) reverses streptozotocin-induced (STZ) diabetes. Adminis-tration of Ilotropin, {{a protein}} extract isolated from CW pan-creata, causes recapitulation of normal islet ontogeny and reverses STZ diabetes, reducing mortality by 50 %. We in-vestigated {{the hypothesis that}} a novel gene encoding a con-stituent of Ilotropin was expressed in the hamster pancreas undergoing islet neogenesis. Islet neogenesis associated pro-tein (INGAP) {{is a product of}} a novel gene expressed in re-generating hamster pancreas. Northern blot analysis showed a strong single transcript of 850 bp at 1 and 2 d after CW that disappeared by the 6 th day and was absent from untreated control pancreata. INGAP gene is expressed in acinar cells, but not in islets. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of INGAP in Ilotropin but not in extracts from control pancreata. A synthetic pentadecapeptide, correspond-ing to a region unique to INGAP, stimulated a 2. 4 -fold in-crease in [3 H]thymidine incorporation into hamster duct epi-thelium in primary culture and a rat pancreatic duct cell line but had no effect on a hamster insulinoma tumor cell line. A portion of human INGAP gene was cloned and ap-pears to be highly homologous to the hamster gene. This data suggests that the INGAP gene is a novel pancreatic gene expressed during islet neogenesis whose protein product is a constituent of Ilotropin and is capable of initiating duct cell proliferation, a prerequisite for islet neogenesis. ...|$|R

Sixteen streamers, 4 {{inches wide and}} 40 inches long, were prepared from crepe paper, <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrapping</b> paper, yellow tracing paper, 16 -lb. white bond paper, Micafilm, 1 mil electrostatic discharge Mylar ® packaging film, 1. 5 mil Mylar, and DragStrip ™ Mylar. Eight additional streamers were prepared from 1. 5 mil Mylar, 4 inches wide and 20, 30, 50, and 60 inches long. Each streamer, {{with the exception of}} those made from crepe paper, was folded in a straight pattern with -inch pleats over all but the last 4 inches closest to the attachment point. A 5 g weight was attached to each streamer at one corner. The streamers were dropped a distance of 20. 1 m in outdoor tests, and the descent times were recorded. Variable wind conditions created moderate turbulence, which resulted in many of the results being rejected. Analysis of the remaining results showed Micafilm to have the slowest descent rate at 2. 04 m·s- 1. Yellow tracing paper, cellophane, and DragStrip Mylar were close behind at about 2. 2 m·s- 1. Crepe paper had the worst performance at 2. 80 m·s- 1. From the length-to-width ratio tests, it is clear that ratios> 10 yield slower descent rates for 1. 5 mil Mylar. An important consideration for streamer duration competition is to build the model to optimum mass. If the model is significantly over optimum mass, it may be advantageous to use a shorter streamer or a lighter weight material such as tracing paper...|$|R

40|$|On February 5, 2001, {{the general}} manager of Canyon Gate Mini Storage {{discovered}} the decomposing body of Christine Smith in the storage unit owned by Smith and her daughter, appellant Brookey Lee West. Smith’s body was sealed in a garbage can wrapped with duct tape, garbage bags and <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrap.</b> A white plastic bag, knotted {{at the back of her}} head, covered Smith’s nose and mouth. Upon searching West’s apartment, police discovered Smith’s bank statements. The police determined that there were numerous ATM withdrawals on Smith’s bank account after February 1998, when Smith was last seen alive. West was charged with murdering Smith by asphyxiation, suffocation, or manner or means unknown. At trial, expert testimony was provided regarding the decomposed body of Smith. An expert for the state opined that the cause and manner of death was undeterminable due to the severity of decomposition. Yet, the finding of the plastic bag covering Smith’s face was consistent with suffocation. The expert also stated that it was possible Smith was placed in the garbage can alive. Although West did not testify at trial, West’s counsel stipulated that she admitted to placing Smith’s body in the garbage can. West was convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole for the murder of her mother, Christine Smith. On appeal, West argued that there was insufficient evidence of criminal agency, the charging information was vague, the district court erroneously admitted gruesome photographic evidence, and the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing argument.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that some N-nitrosobis (2 -oxopropyl) amine (BOP) -induced ductal/ductular {{pancreatic}} cancers in the hamster model develop within islets and that streptozotocin (SZ) pretreatment that caused islet degeneration and atrophy inhibits pancreatic cancer induction. Hence, it appears that in this model islets {{play a significant role in}} exocrine pancreatic carcinogenesis. To examine whether stimulation of islet cell proliferation (nesidioblastosis) enhances pancreatic exocrine cancer development, we tested the effect of the pancreatic carcinogen BOP in hamsters after induction of nesidioblastosis by <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrapping.</b> Before wrapping, hamsters were treated with SZ to inhibit pancreatic tumor induction in the unwrapped pancreatic tissues. Control groups with a wrapped pancreas did not receive SZ. Six weeks after SZ treatment, all hamsters were treated with BOP (10 mg/kg body weight) weekly for 10 weeks and the experiment was terminated 38 weeks after the last BOP treatment. Many animals recovered from their diabetes at the time when BOP was injected and many more after BOP treatment. Only nine hamsters remained diabetic until the end of the experiment. Both SZ-treated and control groups developed proliferative and malignant pancreatic ductal-type lesions primarily in the wrapped area (47 %) but less frequently in the larger segments of the pancreas, including the splenic lobe (34 %), gastric lobe (13 %), and duodenal lobe (6 %). Only a few lesions developed in the unwrapped pancreatic region of nine diabetic hamsters with atrophic islets, whereas seven of these hamsters had tumors in the wrapped area. Histologically, most tumors appeared to originate from islets, many invasive carcinomas had foci of islets, and some tumor cells showed reactivity with anti-insulin. The results show that, in the BOP hamster model, islets are the site of formation of the major fraction of exocrine pancreatic cancer and that induction of nesidioblastosis enhances pancreatic carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Body packing is a {{distinct}} method of drug smuggling. Surgeons and intensive care specialists will be confronted with body packers when packets do not pass spontaneously and rupture, causing drug toxicity. CASE REPORT: We report of a 32 -year-old Liberian male who presented with abdominal complaints and anxiety after having ingested 50 cocaine-containing packets of which 49 had passed the natural route in the previous days. X-ray of his abdomen showed a structure possibly compatible with a packet in or projected over the stomach. We decided to transfer the patient to the operation theatre for surgical removal via gastrotomy. However, no packet was found. During his first day {{in the intensive care}} unit he did not regain consciousness. Repeated urine analyses for cocaine were negative. After one day he deteriorated: he needed circulatory support because of hypotension, without signs of sepsis. Repeated surgery revealed no packet. In the end he turned out not to be suffering from cocaine intoxication.
