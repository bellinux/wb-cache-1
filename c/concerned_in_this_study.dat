30|$|In summary, the {{structure}} design of oxygen-passivated silicon nanonets {{could result in}} indirect–direct band gap transitions of silicon. The Si–O–Si passivated 100 X and 100 D nanonets exhibit direct band gap characteristic when the porosities exceed 29 and 37 %, respectively. The –OH-passivated 110 D and 110 X nanonets with different porosities we <b>concerned</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> have indirect band gap. Si–O–Si bond has more effective influence on the band edge region of the nanonets than –H or –OH bonds {{and is expected to}} change the band gap structure of silicon nanonets. With the rapid development of the materials nano fabrication, it is expected that this electronic characteristic of the nanonets could be validated in experiments.|$|E

To demonstrate the organoclay effect, three different loadings of organoclay, were dispersed in the epoxy resin using mechanical mixer followed by sonication. The corresponding glass/epoxy nanocomposites were prepared by impregnating the organoclay epoxy mixture into the dry glass fiber through a vacuum hand lay-up process. Off-axis block glass/epoxy nanocomposites were tested in compression to produce in-plane shear failure. It is noted only the specimens showing in-plane shear failure mode were <b>concerned</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> Through coordinate transformation law, the uniaxial failure stresses were then converted to a plot of shear stress versus transverse normal stress from which the in-plane shear strength was obtained.
