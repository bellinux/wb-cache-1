Ten <b>constitutive</b> <b>models</b> with potential to describe the phenomenological and micromechanical processes for crushed salt were selected from a literature search. Three of these ten <b>constitutive</b> <b>models,</b> termed Sjaardema-Krieg, Zeuch, and Spiers models, were adopted as candidate <b>constitutive</b> <b>models.</b> The candidate <b>constitutive</b> <b>models</b> were generalized in a consistent manner to three-dimensional states of stress and modified to include the effects of temperature, grain size, and moisture content. A database including hydrostatic consolidation and shear consolidation tests conducted on Waste Isolation Pilot Plant and southeastern New Mexico salt {{was used to determine}} material parameters for the candidate <b>constitutive</b> <b>models.</b> Nonlinear least-squares model fitting to data from the hydrostatic consolidation tests, the shear consolidation tests, and a combination of the shear and hydrostatic tests produces three sets of material parameter values for the candidate models. The change in material parameter values from test group to test group indicates the empirical nature of the models. To evaluate the predictive capability of the candidate models, each parameter value set was used to predict each of the tests in the database. Based on the fitting statistics and the ability of the models to predict the test data, the Spiers model appeared to perform slightly better than the other two candidate models. The work reported here is a first-of-its kind evaluation of <b>constitutive</b> <b>models</b> for reconsolidation of crushed salt. Questions remain to be answered.

40|$|The {{application}} of shape memory alloys (SMAs) to the seismic response reduction of civil engineering structures has attracted growing interest {{due to their}} self-centering feature and excellent fatigue performance. The loading rate dependence of SMAs raises a concern in the seismic analysis of SMA-based devices. However, the implementation of micromechanics-based strain-rate-dependent <b>constitutive</b> <b>models</b> in structural analysis software is rather complicated and computationally demanding. This paper investigates the feasibility of replacing complex rate-dependent <b>models</b> with rate-independent <b>constitutive</b> <b>models</b> for superelastic SMA elements in seismic time-history analysis. Three uniaxial <b>constitutive</b> <b>models</b> for superelastic SMAs, including one rate-dependent thermomechanical model and two rate-independent phenomenological models, are considered in this comparative study. The {{pros and cons of}} the three nonlinear <b>constitutive</b> <b>models</b> are also discussed. A parametric study of single-degree-of-freedom systems with different initial periods and strength reduction factors is conducted to examine the effect of the three <b>constitutive</b> <b>models</b> on seismic simulations. Additionally, nonlinear time-history analyses of a three-story prototype steel frame building with special SMA-based damping braces are performed. Two suites of seismic records that correspond to frequent and design basis earthquakes are used as base excitations in the seismic analyses of steel-braced frames. The results of this study show that the rate-independent <b>constitutive</b> <b>models,</b> with their parameters properly tuned to dynamic test data, are able to predict the seismic responses of structures with SMA-based seismic response modification devices.

Robust <b>constitutive</b> <b>modeling</b> will allow for accurate and reliable modeling and simulation of UHPC structures which is needed for their analysis and design. In this thesis, three elastic-plastic and damage models that were previously used to predict the mechanical properties of NSC were evaluated for use with HPC and UHPC.

[...] In regard to Myers first claim that the separation between first level theories and second level metatheory is paradoxical and therefore an inaccurate or misguided distinction, Craig admits that there is a paradox inherent within a separation between first order theories and metatheory but [...] "slippage between logical levels is an inherent feature (or bug) of communication, and we should not forget that theory is, among other things, communication. [...] " [...] Craig cites Gregory Bateson as pointing out that while the theory of logical types forbids the mixing of different [...] "levels" [...] to avoid paradox, [...] "practical communication necessarily does exactly that." [...] Actual communication is fraught with paradox, and while a logicians ideal would have us try and resolve these paradoxes, in actual practice we don't because {{there is no way to}} do so.
