5|$|An {{individual}} {{killer whale}} <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>be</b> identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and {{the pattern of}} white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|E
50|$|Killybegs Rowing Club <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> seen {{training}} in the harbour {{during the summer months}} and hold an annual regatta on the last weekend of July. The club row the Donegal Skiff, the traditional skiff of county.|$|R

5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>be</b> {{traced to}} antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many {{can be detected}} through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} {{carnivorous}} {{nature and the}} beauty of their glistening traps, sundews have become favorite ornamental plants; however, the environmental requirements of most species are relatively stringent and can be difficult to meet in cultivation. As a result, most species are unavailable commercially. A few of the hardiest varieties, however, have made their way into the mainstream nursery business and <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>be</b> found for sale next to Venus flytraps. These most often include D. capensis, D. aliciae, and D. spatulata.|$|E
5|$|Caprella mutica inhabit shallow {{protected}} marine {{bodies of}} water. They <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>be</b> found in dense colonies attached to submerged artificial structures, marine macroalgae, and other organisms. They are primarily omnivorous detritivores, but can adapt to other feeding methods depending on food availability. They are preyed upon by fish, crabs, {{and several other}} predators.|$|E

50|$|It <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> cultivated, and <b>can</b> {{be grown}} in mixed flower borders, {{on the margins}} of shrubberies or being {{naturalized}} in the garden. It was introduced to Britain in 1658, and was then cultivated in 1748 in the UK, by Mr Philip Miller. Although, it <b>is</b> not <b>often</b> found in bulb nurseries, but a few cultivars can be found in German nurseries.|$|R
50|$|Spoken games <b>can</b> <b>often</b> also <b>be</b> {{categorized}} as guessing games, word games, {{or because of}} their freedom from equipment or visual engagement, car games.|$|R
5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe discomfort; {{it is most}} common when {{metformin}} is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>be</b> avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually but even with low doses 5% of people {{may be unable to}} tolerate metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah usually {{grows in}} open, grassy clearings on old land slips and flat ridge tops, {{particularly}} {{in areas of}} seeping ground water, where the soil is loose and permanently moist. Although these sites can receive very high rainfall, excess water drains away quickly, preventing the soil from becoming waterlogged. N. rajah <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>be</b> found growing in grassy undergrowth, especially among sedges.|$|E
5|$|Pennies {{and other}} small coins are {{sometimes}} ingested by dogs, requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects. The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms. Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>be</b> fatal. The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc.|$|E
50|$|However, Ashby openly {{admits that}} he needs to work on his live game, and is much better known as an online player, in {{particular}} on Black Belt Poker where was recently acquired as one of their sponsored pros in September 2010.

50|$|Fetendo {{intervention}} is less invasive than open fetal surgery. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>often</b> <b>be</b> achieved {{with just a}} small guided wire sent through a needle-puncture of the skin (percutaneous), though {{in some cases it}} may require that a small opening be made in the mother's abdomen.|$|R
5|$|Related by {{periodic}} trends, rhenium has {{a similar}} chemistry to that of technetium; work done to label rhenium onto target compounds <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>be</b> translated to technetium. This is useful for radiopharmacy, where {{it is difficult to}} work with technetium – especially the 99m isotope used in medicine – due to its expense and short half-life.|$|E
5|$|Suillus americanus is {{a common}} species, and is found growing solitarily or in {{clusters}} on the ground throughout northeastern North America, north to Canada, where it typically fruits {{in the late summer}} and autumn. It is also found in Guangdong, China, an example of a disjunct distribution. Fruit bodies <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>be</b> found in drier weather when other species are not abundant.|$|E
5|$|The {{researches}} of John Harvey {{have uncovered}} {{the names of}} many English medieval architects, and by tracing stylistic characteristics, it has sometimes proved possible to track their careers from one building to another. Leading architects were highly paid - especially those employed in the King's works - and they <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>be</b> identified from regular payments in cathedral accounts.|$|E
50|$|Cancer productus is carnivorous; in Puget Sound it will crush {{barnacles}} {{with its}} large pincers for consumption. Small living crabs and dead fish are also eaten. Mating in this species {{occurs when the}} female is soft-shelled from October to June in Puget Sound. The male <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> seen guarding females until molting during this time. This species {{is known to be}} a favorite prey item of Enteroctopus dofleini, the giant Pacific octopus.|$|R
50|$|Decision-making {{techniques}} can be separated into two broad categories: group decision-making techniques and individual decision-making techniques. Individual decision-making techniques <b>can</b> also <b>often</b> <b>be</b> applied by a group.|$|R
50|$|The {{algebraic}} {{nature of}} polynomial codes, with cleverly chosen generator polynomials, <b>can</b> also <b>often</b> <b>be</b> exploited to find efficient error correction algorithms. This {{is the case}} for BCH codes.|$|R
5|$|Trained {{cockatoos}} {{are sometimes}} seen in bird shows in zoos. They are generally less motivated by food than other birds; some may more respond to petting or praise than food. Cockatoos <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>be</b> taught {{to wear a}} parrot harness, enabling their owners to take them outdoors. Cockatoos {{have been used in}} animal-assisted therapy, generally in nursing homes.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>be</b> seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>be</b> prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E
5000|$|This sedge is an aquatic or shore plant which <b>can</b> most <b>often</b> <b>be</b> {{found in}} peat bogs in mountains. It is widely {{distributed}} across North America and northern Eurasia.|$|R
5000|$|A refuge island, {{also known}} as a {{pedestrian}} refuge or pedestrian island, is a small section of pavement or sidewalk, completely surrounded by asphalt or other road materials, where pedestrians can stop before finishing crossing a road. It is typically used when a street is very wide, as the pedestrian crossing can be too long for some individuals to cross in one traffic light cycle, they <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> seen on roads with higher speed limits also.|$|R
50|$|Started in the mid-2000s, the La Casa de Todos {{association}} {{operates a}} pizzeria and bakery that employs street children. These young people <b>can</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> {{seen in the}} colonia selling candy and other items in order to survive. The goal of the association is to give these young people steady employment and job skills. The operation is small, mostly selling {{to those in the}} colonia, but it hopes to get contracts to provide bread and other foods to hospitals and prisons.|$|R
