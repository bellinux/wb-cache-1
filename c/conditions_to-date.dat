40|$|Dunes, dune fields, and ripples {{are unique}} and useful {{records of the}} {{interaction}} between wind and granular materials – finding such features on a planetary surface immediately suggests certain information about climate and surface conditions (at least during the dunes’ formation and evolution). Additionally, studies of dune characteristics under non-Earth conditions allow for “tests” of aeolian process models based primarily on observations of terrestrial features and dynamics, and refinement of the models to include consideration of a wider range of environmental and planetary <b>conditions.</b> <b>To-date,</b> the planetary aeolian community has found and studied dune fields on Mars, Venus, and the Saturnian moon Titan. Additionally, we have observed candidate “aeolian bedforms” on Comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the Jovian moon Io, and – most recently – Pluto. In this paper, we hypothesize that the progression of investigations of aeolian bedforms and processes on a particular planetary body follows a consistent sequence – primarily set by the acquisition of data of particular types and resolutions, and by the maturation of knowledge about that planetary body. We define that sequence of generated knowledge and new questions (within seven investigation phases) and discuss examples from all of the studied bodies. The aim of such a sequence is to better define our past and current state of understanding about the aeolian bedforms of a particular body, to highlight the related assumptions that require re-analysis with data acquired during later investigations, and to use lessons learned from planetary and terrestrial aeolian studies to predict what types of investigations could be most fruitful in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{investigation}} was to study the mechanisms of mixed salt crystallisation fouling on heat transfer surfaces during convective heat transfer and sub-cooled flow boiling <b>conditions.</b> <b>To-date</b> no investigations on the effects of operating parameters on the deposition of mixtures of calcium sulphate and calcium carbonate, which are the most common constituents of scales formed on heat transfer surfaces, have been reported. As part of this research project, a substantial number of experiments were performed to determine the mechanisms controlling deposition. Fluid velocity, heat flux, surface and bulk temperatures, concentration of the solution, ionic strength, pressure and heat transfer surface material were varied systematically. After clarification of the effect of these parameters on the deposition process, the results of these experiments were used to develop a mechanistic model for prediction of fouling resistances, caused by crystallisation of mixed salts, under convective heat transfer and subcooled flow boiling conditions. It was assumed that the deposition process of calcium sulphate and calcium carbonate takes place in two successive events. These events are the combined effects related to transport phenomena and chemical kinetics. The effect of the extra deposition created on the heat transfer surface due to sub-cooled flow boiling was considered by inclusion of an enhancement factor. The newly developed model takes into account the effects of all important parameters on scaling phenomena and also considers the simultaneous precipitation and competition of various minerals in the scale formation process. Model predictions were compared with the measured experimental data when calcium sulphate and calcium carbonate form and deposit on the heat transfer surface simultaneously. While deviations ranging from 6 % to 25 % between model predictions and measured experimental data can be considered good in the context of such a complex process, fouling morphology is clearly a factor to be considered in more detail. This is particularly problematic in the context of more complex fouling solutions encountered in industry. Furthermore, the crystalline samples were analysed using Scanning Electron Microscopy, X- Ray Diffraction and Ion Chromatography techniques. Fractal analysis performed on Scanning Electron Microscopy photographs of the deposits was used to quantify deposit characteristics by introducing a new quantity called the fractal dimension...|$|E

5000|$|The {{psychophysics}} model incorporates framing effects - {{asserting that}} {{the manner in which}} a goal is framed impacts perceptions of progress during goal pursuit. [...] Perceptions of progress subsequently impact the level of effort exerted during various steps during goal pursuit. Progress measured from a goal's initial state is referred to as a [...] "to-date" [...] frame and progress measured from a goal's end state is referred to as a [...] "to-go" [...] frame (Bonezzi et al., 2011). In an experiment run with undergraduate student participants, Bonezzi et al. (2011) gave participants $15 to donate to a charity with a goal of $300 total donations. [...] Participants were put into two groups: a to-date group and a to-go group. In the <b>to-date</b> <b>condition,</b> money that the charity had collected toward its goal was framed as money already collected. In the to-go condition, progress in reaching the $300 goal was framed as money left to collect to reach the goal. Consistent with the psychophysics model, Bonezzi et al. (2011) found that the rate of donations by participants in the to-date group was highest during {{the early stages of the}} goal and the rate of donation by participants in the to-go group was highest during the late stages of the goal.|$|R
