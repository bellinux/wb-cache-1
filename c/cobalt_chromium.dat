25|$|The femoral {{component}} is the component that fits in the femur (thigh bone). Bone is removed and the femur is shaped {{to accept the}} femoral stem with attached prosthetic femoral head (ball). There {{are two types of}} fixation: cemented and uncemented. Cemented stems use acrylic bone cement to form a mantle between the stem and to the bone. Uncemented stems use friction, shape and surface coatings to stimulate bone to remodel and bond to the implant. Stems are made of multiple materials (titanium, <b>cobalt</b> <b>chromium,</b> stainless steel, and polymer composites) and they can be monolithic or modular. Modular components consist of different head dimensions and/or modular neck orientations; these attach via a taper similar to a Morse taper. These options allow for variability in leg length, offset and version. Femoral heads are made of metal or ceramic material. Metal heads, made of <b>cobalt</b> <b>chromium</b> for hardness, are machined to size and then polished to reduce wear of the socket liner. Ceramic heads are more smooth than polished metal heads, have a lower coefficient of friction than a cobalt chrome head, and in theory will wear down the socket liner more slowly. As of early 2011, follow-up studies in patients have not demonstrated significant reductions in wear rates between the various types of femoral heads on the market. Ceramic implants are more brittle and may break after being implanted.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the poor}} {{results of the}} first-generation metal-on-polyethylene hip {{resurfacing}} arthroplasties of the 1970 s and 1980 s, the concept was successfully reintroduced in the 1990 s using second-generation metal-on-metal bearings. The first paper describes the first 200 cases performed at the Ghent University Hospital from 1998 on. This is the first not designer-related report about the clinical success of the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing arthroplasty. Complications known to occur with the first-generation resurfacings were not seen and patients were able to regain high activity levels, including sports. The second paper compares the clinical results of the resurfacing technique with those of conventional total hip replacement using a ceramic-on-ceramic bearing in young active patients. In general, the functional outcome was better and activity levels were higher in resurfacing patients. The third paper emphasizes the clinical advantages of large-diameter metal bearings over constrained polyethylene devices in difficult primary total hip replacements or revision cases, when stability problems can be expected. Device-related complications and dislocations were significantly less frequent with large-diameter metal bearings. Despite the excellent clinical results of modern hip resurfacing arthroplasty as a solution for polyethylene disease with resultant osteolysis and subsequent loosening of the prosthesis in young active patients, another potential health hazard arises when metal-on-metal bearings are used. Elevated blood levels of <b>cobalt</b> and <b>chromium</b> may have negative long-term health consequences, although {{a higher incidence of}} cancer has not been reported so far. Another potential hazard is the risk of local allergic reactions to cobalt-chromium devices. The fourth paper compares three different second-generation metal-on-metal bearings, including two different resurfacing devices and one 28 -mm metal bearing, {{with each other and with}} a 28 -mm ceramic bearing control group. Despite substantial metallurgical differences, only a significant difference in blood levels of <b>cobalt</b> and <b>chromium</b> was found in favour of the Durom compared to the BHR resurfacing device. In all three metal bearing groups, however, outliers for <b>cobalt</b> and <b>chromium</b> levels were present, mainly due to improper implant positioning, although some outliers could not be clearly accounted for. No correlations were found between metal ion levels and activity level of the patients, supporting the tribology of metal-on-metal bearings. The fifth paper looks for correlations between implant positioning and blood levels of <b>cobalt</b> and <b>chromium</b> in patients with unilateral hip resurfacings, in order to find out whether outliers for <b>cobalt</b> and <b>chromium</b> could be explained by abnormal positioning of the acetabular component. A significant correlation was found between cup inclination and ion levels. When the abduction of the acetabular cup exceeded 55 °, significantly higher levels of <b>cobalt</b> and <b>chromium</b> were found, especially when smaller sizes were used, as eg. in women. The sixth paper tries to validate blood levels of <b>cobalt</b> and <b>chromium</b> as a diagnostic tool for the functioning of metal-on-metal implants. A significant correlation was found between blood ion levels, <b>cobalt</b> and <b>chromium</b> levels in the synovial fluid of the artificial joint and the wear measurements of the retrieved implants. This suggests that blood levels of <b>cobalt</b> and <b>chromium</b> quite accurately reflect the functioning of a metal-on-metal bearing. The seventh paper tries to determine whether modern cell saver devices, often used in hip revision surgery in order to avoid blood transfusions, were efficient in sufficiently removing <b>cobalt</b> and <b>chromium</b> from reinfused blood. <b>Cobalt</b> and <b>chromium</b> were equally removed by the devices, although the percentage reduction was only 76. 3 % and 78. 6 %, respectively. As metal ions are potentially hazardous to health, surgeons should be aware that the current cell saver devices do not adequately remove <b>cobalt</b> and <b>chromium</b> from reinfused blood. Despite the excellent clinical results of hip resurfacing arthroplasty and the use of large metal-on-metal bearings, blood metal ion levels should be closely monitored if there is clinical or radiographic evidence of poor implant functioning. Implant positioning seems to be critical to optimal functioning of a metal-on-metal bearing...|$|R

[...] This capacity for accumulation is due to hypertolerance, or phytotolerance: the result of adaptative evolution from the plants to hostile environments through many generations.

50|$|The ceramic {{surface is}} {{extremely}} abrasion resistant compared to traditional metal implant {{materials such as}} <b>cobalt</b> <b>chromium.</b> It also has a lower coefficient of friction against ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), the typical counterface material used in total joint replacements. These two factors likely contribute to the significantly lower UHMWPE wear rates observed in simulator testing. Reducing UHMWPE wear is thought to decrease the risk of implant failure due to osteolysis. All-ceramic materials can have a similar effect on reducing wear, but are brittle and difficult to manufacture. The metal substrate of Oxinium implants makes components easier to manufacture and gives them greater toughness (a combination of strength and ductility). In essence, this technology combines the abrasion resistance and low friction of a ceramic with the workability and toughness of a metal.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The adverse {{biological}} {{effects of}} continuous exposure to <b>cobalt</b> and <b>chromium</b> {{have been well}} defined. In the past, this toxicity was largely an industrial issue concerning workers exposed in occupational setting. Nevertheless, recent reports have described a specific toxicity mediated by {{the high levels of}} <b>cobalt</b> and <b>chromium</b> released by metallic prostheses, particularly in patients who had received hip implants. Clinical symptoms, including blindness, deafness and peripheral neuropathy, suggest a specific neurotropism. However, {{little is known about the}} neuropathological basis of this process, and experimental evidence is still lacking. We have investigated this issue in an experimental setting using New Zealand White rabbits treated with repeated intravenous injections of <b>cobalt</b> and <b>chromium,</b> alone or in combination. No evident clinical or pathological alterations were associated after chromium administration alone, despite its high levels in blood and tissue while cobalt-chromium and cobalt-treated rabbits showed clinical signs indicative of auditory and optic system toxicity. On histopathological examination, the animals showed severe retinal and cochlear ganglion cell depletion along with optic nerve damage and loss of sensory cochlear hair cells. Interestingly, the severity of the alterations was related to dosages and time of exposure. These data confirmed our previous observation of severe auditory and optic nerve toxicity in patients exposed to an abnormal release of <b>cobalt</b> and <b>chromium</b> from damaged hip prostheses. Moreover, we have identified the major element mediating neurotoxicity to be cobalt, although the molecular mechanisms mediating this toxicity still have to be defined...|$|R
