In a hypothetical case study, thirteen WWTP upgrade options are compared in terms of their effluent quality and economic performance.

40|$|The ALARP {{principle}} is applied {{in many areas}} to regulate the tolerable level of risk. Usually the {{principle is}} operationalized by assigning a value per fatality. A cost-benefit analysis is used to trade the expected value of lives saved with the costs of technical measures required to reduce risks. In sectors in which risks have been reduced {{over a period of}} years, it is difficult to pinpoint those areas in which further risk reduction might be sought. In this article we show that many different risk reduction mechanisms can be considered simultaneously in a decision analysis framework. Using influence diagrams it is straightforward to build mini-decision analysis models in which competing alternatives addressing the same risk can be compared. The mini-model decision alternatives are assembled into decision strategies representing the best possible combination of alternatives at different cost/benefit ratios. Disynergies between the different alternatives are highlighted through the model. The overall aim is to build a high-level model to explore the sensitivity of risk reduction measures to the value per fatality parameter.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} integrated methodological approach for identifying cost-effective combinations of agri-environmental measures to achieve water quality targets. The methodological approach involves linking hydro-chemical modelling with economic costs of mitigation measures. The utility of the approach was explored for the River Dee catchment in North East Scotland, examining the cost-effectiveness of mitigation measures for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pollutants. In-stream nitrate concentration was modelled using the STREAM-N and phosphorus using INCA-P model. Both models were first run for baseline conditions and then their effectiveness for changes in land management was simulated. Costs were based on farm income foregone, capital and operational expenditures. The costs and effects data were integrated using ‘Risk Solver Platform’ optimization in excel to produce the most cost-effective combination of measures by which target nutrient reductions could be attained at a minimum economic cost. The analysis identified different combination of measures as most costeffective for the two pollutants.

40|$|Drought across swathes of Australia, {{highlights}} {{our need}} for water conservation {{in addition to}} seeking new sources of water (demand and supply-side resource options). Water conservation or efficiency improvement is currently a non-systematic process {{along the lines of}} 'if we do such and such then we will save so much water'. Such an approach is ad-hoc and only has the appearance of being 'quantitative'. We would class it as qualitative, or maybe advanced qualitative water conservation. True quantitative or structured water auditing of non-domestic water consumption is an iterative, systematic and documented process of obtaining reliable use data, validated by a closure approach. Opportunities are identified for water use reduction, water reuse, recycling and for water resource substitution. Financial assessment of savings in cost against <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> will provide a payback period. A water management strategy or Water Management Plan (WMP) as it is known in Victoria, Australia, is devised which is consistent with legal requirements, the enterprise's environmental policy and its movement towards sustainable development. Regulators have legislated for mandatory WMPs and audits in Victoria, but this is the only state so far to do this. Mandatory water auditing should be an uncontested choice as it can only provide a win:win situation regulation to the private sector. We argue that only the systematic process provided by structural water auditing constitutes quantitative water conservation. Further, statutory obligation for water users to engage in the water auditing process will give the broad, systematic quantitative information, and based upon which optimal water management strategies or WMPs can be devised. This will ensure a rational approach to our future water needs and the needs of our environment.

This limits proper evaluation of current policies and measures for solving or preventing nitrate pollution of drinking water resources. The cost for society associated with nitrate is also relevant for integrated assessment of EU nitrogen policies taking a perspective of welfare optimization. The overarching question is at which nitrogen mitigation level the social <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures,</b> including their consequence for availability of food and energy, matches the social benefit of these measures for human health and biodiversity. Methods Epidemiological studies suggest colon cancer to be possibly associated with nitrate in drinking water.

Health costs are provisionally compared with nitrate mitigation costs and social benefits of fertilizer use. Results For above median meat consumption the risk of colon cancer doubles when exposed to drinking water exceeding 25 mg/L of nitrate (NO 3) for more than ten years. We estimate the associated increase of incidence of colon cancer from nitrate contamination of groundwater based drinking water in EU 11 at 3 %. This corresponds to a population-averaged health loss of 2. 9 euro per capita or 0. 7 euro per kg of nitrate-N leaching from fertilizer. Conclusions Our cost estimates indicate that current measures to prevent exceedance of 50 mg/L NO 3 are probably beneficial for society and that a stricter nitrate limit and additional measures may be justified. The present assessment of social cost is uncertain because it considers only one type of cancer, it is based on one epidemiological study in Iowa, and involves various assumptions regarding exposure.

40|$|Australia is gliding {{into its}} 26 th year of {{uninterrupted}} economic expansion {{at the same}} time that the United States and the United Kingdom are wrestling with political rebellions against the very forces that have stoked Australia’s long boom. Open trade, high migration, and unimpeded economic globalisation are under political challenge in major advanced economies. In those same economies, respected economists are predicting a gloomier future. Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has declared ours to be an “Age of Secular Stagnation”. US economist Robert Gordon says the best is over for the US economy and others like it. This Analysis finds that Australia is an exception to unfavourable trends said to be evident in other advanced economies. There is no evidence of secular stagnation in the Australian economy — and not much evidence of it in the US economy either. Australia exhibits very few of the ‘headwinds’ to growth Gordon cites for the United States. There is no doubt global output growth is slowing, however, largely because of slowing population growth, ageing of the population, and the inevitable decline in emerging economy productivity growth as they catch up to advanced economies. Even so, Australia can remain strikingly exceptional, underpinned by markedly stronger workforce growth over the next 35 years than is now likely in the United States (or China, Europe or Japan, all of which will have shrinking workforces). Australia cannot control what happens in the rest of the world, but with sensible policies to enhance the value of its human capital Australian living standards can grow a little faster than those of the United States, Europe, or Japan over coming decades. Those sensible policies will, however, become harder to sustain as global competition for skilled migrants increases, as the political <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> to increase workforce participation rise, and as bigger disparities in Australian household wealth become increasingly apparent in similarly widening disparities in Australian incomes and life opportunities...|$|E
40|$|Different {{scenarios}} {{and their}} prioritization were identified for the Sacca di Goro (Adriatic Sea, Northern Italy), an eutrophic lagoon which is exploited with extensive clam farming activities. A preliminary scenario assessment was investigated with qualitative modelling. Economic and environmental variables were accommodated {{in a comprehensive}} model of the lagoon that describes major interactions between selected compartments. This kind of analysis is specially suited for systems that are partially specified. In a second step, we addressed the first priority scenario identified by end-users and which concerns clam farming activities in the lagoon. This scenario was analysed using a quantitative approach based on a 3 D integrated hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Such approach allowed {{the assessment of the}} implications of an increase in the clam farming area. The first results seems to indicate that a further increase of clam farming areas (or a more intense exploitation) inside the Sacca di Goro lagoon would increase the risk of anoxia and the vulnerability of clam farming to Ulva blooms. On the contrary, an increase in the exploitation area outside the lagoon will increase the average productivity and maintain constant the risks of anoxia and the vulnerability to Ulva blooms. Furthermore, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> taken by the local and regional authorities for the lagoon management and to control nuisance macroalgal blooms are potentially compensated by the increase in clams production predicted by the model. The focus on clam farming provides only a partial view of a more complex system which composes by agriculture, urban, touristic areas, and natural sites and is under the influence of climate changes. However, such scenarios constitute only the first stage in the procedure of overall lagoon scenario analysis, and a second iteration is necessary to define the main constraints and boundaries, as well as to incorporate the economic evaluation and social implications of the different options.

40|$|The present {{deliverable}} {{describes the}} economic assessment of counter measures. Cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis are compared to cost-benefit analysis. Cost-effectiveness analysis helps {{to estimate the}} costs per prevented fatality or injury. To evaluate the effectiveness in terms of different levels of severity jointly, one has to conduct a cost-utility analysis, where fatality reduction and injury reduction are brought together on a joint scale: quality adjusted live years (QALY) saved. QALYs represent the years of life lost due to fatalities {{and the quality of}} life loss resulting from injuries. Cost-benefit analysis also allows the joint evaluation of measures’ effectiveness in reducing crashes of different severity. Moreover it provides information on the socio-economic return of counter measures, and in principle allows to include side-effects into the analysis. The valuation of other possible impacts of road safety measures {{is beyond the scope of}} SafetyCube, but presentation in terms of cost-benefit ratios allows for the post hoc inclusion of other impacts if DSS users have estimates of these. In the discussion of decision criteria within cost-benefit analysis it is demonstrated that measures with a high cost-benefit ratio (benefits/costs) do not necessarily have a large net-effect (benefits — costs). The net-present value will favour measures with large benefits even if they come at a relatively large cost, while the cost benefit ratio will favour measures with the best value for money, even if their actual benefits are relatively small (e. g., because they are targeted at a small group of crashes). The meaning of costs in the framework of economic welfare theory (the basis of cost-benefit analysis) is not necessarily the same as in everyday language. In this context concepts like opportunity costs and discounting are discussed. Opportunity costs (the value of things you could have done with the money or resources otherwise) are usually approximated by the market price. The exception are costs that are payed from tax-money, which are brought into cost benefit analysis at a higher rate. Discounting is used to bring costs made at different points in time to the same present value. There is a relation between the discount rate and a preference for short-term vs. long term projects. For the estimation of the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures,</b> different components and data sources for these costs are discussed with examples from infrastructure and vehicle measures. Furthermore, the report presents an overview and classification of crash costs components and estimation methods. One of the biggest components are the human costs. These are an indication of how much the prevention of crashes is worth for us (the people), which is measured by the willingness to pay method. Other costs are estimated by the restitution method (what are the costs to compensate the damage done) and the human capital approach (how much benefit would the victim have produced). The information on economic efficiency assessment will be integrated into the SafetyCube Decision support system by means of a cost-benefit calculator that is based on the costs of measures collected in the analysis work packages (WP 4, 5, 6) and costs of crashes collected in WP 3.

40|$|Electrical {{energy is}} a product and, like any other product, should satisfy the proper quality requirements. If {{electrical}} equipment is to operate correctly, it requires electrical energy to be supplied at a voltage that is within a specified range around the rated value. A {{significant part of the}} equipment in use today, especially electronic and computer devices, requires good power quality (PQ). However, the same equipment often causes distortion of the voltage supply in the installation, because of its non-linear characteristics, i. e. it draws a non-sinusoidal current with a sinusoidal supply voltage (see Section 3. 1 of this Guide). Thus, maintaining satisfactory PQ is a joint responsibility for the supplier and the electricity user. According to standard EN 50160 [1] the supplier is the party who provides electricity via a public distribution system, and the user or customer is the purchaser of electricity from a supplier. The user is entitled to receive a suitable quality of power from the supplier. In practice the level of PQ is a compromise between user and supplier. Where the available PQ is not sufficient for the user’s needs, PQ improvement measures will be needed and will be the subject of a cost-benefit analysis (see Section 2. 5 of this Guide). However, the cost of poor PQ usually exceeds the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> required for improvement - it is estimated that losses caused by poor power quality cost EU industry and commerce about € 10 billion per annum (see Section 2. 1 of this Guide). However, electrical energy is a very specific product. The possibility for storing electricity in any significant quantity is very limited so it is consumed at the instant it is generated. Measurement and evaluation {{of the quality of the}} supplied power has to be made at the instant of its consumption. The measurement of PQ is complex, since the supplier and user, whose sensitive electrical equipment is also a source of disturbances, have different perspectives. Standard IEC 038 [2] distinguishes two different voltages in electrical networks and installations: supply voltage, which is the line-to-line or line-to-neutral voltage at the point of common coupling, i. e. main supplying point of installation, utility voltage, which is the line-to-line or line-to-neutral voltage at the plug or terminal of the electrical device. The main document dealing with requirements concerning the supplier’s side is standard EN 50160, which characterises voltage parameters of electrical energy in public distribution systems. This is a European standard but it is supplemented in some regions or countries by other supplemental standards, such as [3] in Germany, or [4] in Poland. Many regional codes, such as the German TAB [3] apply to an individual utility, but these are being unified as part of the liberalisation of the German electricity market. According to IEC 038, both standard EN 50160 and rules [3, 4] concern the supply voltage, i. e. that measured at the point of common coupling. On the user’s side, it is the quality of power available to the user’s equipment that is important. Correct equipment operation requires the level of electromagnetic influence on equipment to be maintained below certain limits. Equipment is influenced by disturbances on the supply and by other equipment in the installation, as well as itself influencing the supply. These problems are summarised in the EN 61000 series of EMC standards, in which limits of conducted disturbances are characterised. Equipment sensitivity to utility voltage quality, as well as mitigation measures, are presented in Section 3 (Harmonics) and Section 5 (Voltage Disturbances) of this Guide. The subject of this section is a detailed presentation of standard EN 50160 and an analysis of its requirements according to the operation of chosen equipment. Methods of measuring supply voltage parameters are also presented...|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that pricing {{is required to}} control congestion on the Internet. One lesson that has emerged from many proposals is that any price system should be simple and robust to competition. This is highlighted in the question currently under debate {{in the market for}} Internet services: should usage prices should be employed at all? In a duopoly model with overall positive network effects, it is shown that flat rate pricing can occur in equilibrium, even when the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> variable demand are very smal...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{class of}} general {{incomplete}} multiresponse (randomized block) models, {{in which it}} is not necessary for all responses to be measured on every experimental unit, is considered. For p = 2 responses, the optimum model is obtained under a reasonable cost constraint and the determinant criterion. The optimum model will belong to the subclass of hierarchical multiresponse models but does not always reduce to the standard multiresponse model. For general p, similar results are obtained under restrictions on the correlations between the responses or on the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> the responses...|$|R
30|$|Software {{quality is}} not {{achieved}} by chance; a product does not just attain the specified requirements by sheer luck. It {{is the result}} of deliberate actions and steps which cost time, money and effort. While ensuring quality has a <b>cost,</b> lack <b>of</b> quality has a cost too. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> quality can be divided into three: <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> prevention, <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> appraisal and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> failure. <b>Costs</b> <b>of</b> prevention include <b>costs</b> to plan and coordinate activities in the SQA process; appraisal <b>costs</b> include <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> the product such as testing, review and metrics evaluations while <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> failure include <b>cost</b> to correct an error, or rework a process due to defect. Failure costs can be internal based on defects detected before shipment to the client or external, based on defects detected have deploying at the client’s site (Pressman 2010).|$|R
