50|$|On {{most modern}} vessels with direct {{combustion}} engines or electric propulsors, the main <b>control</b> <b>handle</b> {{on the bridge}} acts as a direct throttle with no intervening engine room personnel. As such, it is regarded under the rules of marine classification societies as a remote control device rather than an EOT, though it is still often referred to by the traditional name. This is somewhat confusing, as the classification society rules for merchant ships still in fact require an EOT to be provided, to allow orders to be transmitted to the local control position in the engine room {{in the event that}} the remote control system should fail. The EOT is required to be electrically isolated from the remote control system. However, it may be mechanically linked to the main <b>control</b> <b>handle,</b> allowing telegraph orders to be given using the same user interface as for remote control orders. Traditional EOTs (though in a more modern form) can still be found on all nuclear powered ships and submarines as they still require an engineering crew member to operate the throttles for the steam turbines that drive the propellers. EOTs can also be found on older vessels that lack remote control technology, particularly those with conventional steam engines.|$|E

40|$|Non-local control {{transfer}} and exception handling {{have a long}} tradition in higher-order programming languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme and ML. However, each language stops short of providing a full and comple-mentary approach — <b>control</b> <b>handling</b> is provided only if the corresponding control operator is first-order. In this work, we describe handlers in a higher-order con-trol setting.
