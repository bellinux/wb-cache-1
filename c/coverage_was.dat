5|$|Beginning in the 1940s, NBC {{broadcast}} {{coverage from}} Times Square anchored by Ben Grauer on both radio and television. Its <b>coverage</b> <b>was</b> later incorporated into special episodes of The Tonight Show, continuing through Johnny Carson and Jay Leno's tenures on the program. NBC would introduce a dedicated special, New Year's Eve with Carson Daly, beginning in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 a new curricular {{adjustment}} was made, {{with the}} objective to fulfill all the quality accreditation requirements. In 2001 the <b>coverage</b> <b>was</b> increased by the aperture of the programs each semester {{and the creation of}} nocturnal courses. The same year, the research system was implemented and the Publishing House was reopened.|$|E
5|$|Television {{broadcasts}} of Paralympic Games {{began in}} 1976, but this early <b>coverage</b> <b>was</b> confined to taped-delay releases to one nation or region. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics there were 45hours of live coverage {{but it was}} available only in Europe. Other countries broadcast highlight packages during the Games. No meaningful improvements in coverage occurred until the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney.|$|E

Former Olympic contenders – including gold medallists Michael Johnson, Shirley Robertson, Adrian Moorhouse, Steve Redgrave, Jonathan Edwards and Chris Boardman – provided analysis.|$|E
5|$|Although cinematographer Clyde DaVinna is {{credited}} with the cinematography, additional footage was shot by George Gordon Nogle, Josiah Roberts, and Leonard Smith. Screenwriter John Lee Mahin claims he shot {{a few of the}} scenes with Eskimo women when <b>coverage</b> <b>was</b> found to be lacking. Numerous days of shooting were lost in the summer when strong sunlight made it impossible to film. To reduce glare from the snow, most of the sets were sprayed with pink paint from the air.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles sent {{advertisements}} {{to groups}} in California and {{were invited to}} speak to New Age devotees there in April 1975. At this meeting, they persuaded {{about half of the}} 50 attendees to follow them. They also focused on college campuses, speaking at Cañada College in August. At a meeting in Oregon in September 1975, they saw further recruitment success—about 30 people left their homes to follow the pair, prompting interest from media outlets. The <b>coverage</b> <b>was</b> negative: commentators and some former members mocked the group and leveled accusations of brainwashing against Applewhite and Nettles. Balch and Taylor state that Applewhite and Nettles eschewed pressure tactics, seeking only devoted followers.|$|E
30|$|Target coverage. The target <b>coverage</b> {{percentage}} <b>is</b> {{measured as}} {{the ratio of}} the number of covered targets to the total number of targets deployed in the terrain. The target <b>coverage</b> <b>is</b> the most important issue in the directional sensor network, and thus, the higher percentage of <b>coverage</b> <b>is</b> expected.|$|R
50|$|Newspapers: Print <b>coverage</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} scant in Melbourne's {{two major}} daily newspapers, the Herald Sun and The Age, but more <b>coverage</b> <b>is</b> provided by specialist newspaper GoalWeekly, non-English language newspapers and free suburban newspapers.|$|R
5000|$|GSM <b>coverage</b> <b>is</b> very good, while EDGE and UMTS <b>coverage</b> <b>is</b> rather sparse, [...] and {{the usage}} for higher speeds is only {{possible}} on certain, mainly urban locations {{and in the}} Adriatic Sea area.|$|R
5|$|For {{the first}} time, Olympic <b>coverage</b> <b>was</b> {{broadcast}} in high-definition on BBC HD. Digital television viewers {{had access to}} up to six streamed channels covering the games on BBC Red Button, whilst the BBC's website permitted British broadband users to view live streams {{from a variety of}} events. Live broadcasts ran overnight and throughout the day on BBC One and BBC Two, starting at 0200 daily; a highlights programme, Games Today, was broadcast on BBC One following the close of each day's events.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Reporters Union of Indonesia {{recognised}} The Jakarta Post {{as being}} one of the Indonesian newspapers that best followed the journalism ethics and standards; other papers so recognised were Kompas and Indo Pos. The paper received the Adam Malik Award in January 2009 for their reporting on foreign politics; the <b>coverage</b> <b>was</b> considered accurate and educated, with good analysis. The following year three reporters received the Adiwarta Award from Sampoerna for excellent photography in the fields of culture, law, and politics. Another journalist received the Adam Malik Award in 2014 for his writings which assisted the ministry to distribute information regarding foreign policy implementation.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, C-SPAN's online {{political}} <b>coverage</b> <b>was</b> expanded {{just prior}} to the elections, with the introduction of three special pages on the C-SPAN website: the C-SPAN Convention Hubs and C-SPAN Debate Hub, which offered video of major events as well as discussion from weblogs and social media about the major party conventions and candidate debates. C-SPAN brought back the Convention Hub for the 2012 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|Kaye, {{using the}} name Matt Martel, {{wrestled}} Kurt Angle in an invitational match on the February 24, 2005 episode of SmackDown! in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After the revelation that Kaye was a teacher appeared in mainstream news publications, Kaye made a WWE second appearance on the July 11, 2005 episode of Raw to face Angle for a second time. His news <b>coverage</b> <b>was</b> played up by Angle, who once again defeated Kaye. The following week, Angle defeated him {{for the third consecutive}} time. Kaye, now known as Matt Striker, went on to compete on Heat and appear in WWE's developmental territory, Deep South Wrestling.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 U.S. Open Cup Final {{was played}} on September 2 at RFK Stadium in Washington D.C. A total of 17,329 fans {{attended}} the match, 38% of the stadium's available capacity. Approximately 200 Sounders FC fans sat {{together in the}} upper deck. Both the travel distance and the mid-week scheduling {{made it difficult for}} Seattle fans to attend. Live television <b>coverage</b> <b>was</b> provided nationally by Fox Soccer Channel.|$|E
5|$|The {{first true}} {{national}} census with exhaustive and broad <b>coverage</b> <b>was</b> {{carried out in}} 1872. The {{small number of people}} and small number of towns reported by the census reveal Brazil's enormous territory to have been sparsely populated. It showed Brazil as having a total population of 9,930,478 inhabitants. Estimates made by the government in prior decades showed 4,000,000 inhabitants in 1823 and gave a figure of 7,000,700 in 1854. The population was distributed across 20 provinces and the Neutral Municipality (the Empire's capital) with 641 municipalities.|$|E
5000|$|Branch {{coverage}} (a {{specific type}} of code <b>coverage)</b> <b>is</b> a metric {{of the number of}} branches executed under test, where [...] "100% branch coverage" [...] means that every branch in a program has been executed at least once under some test. Branch <b>coverage</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the most important}} metrics for software testing; software for which the branch <b>coverage</b> <b>is</b> low is not generally considered to be thoroughly tested. Note that code <b>coverage</b> metrics <b>are</b> a property of the tests for a piece of software, not of the software being tested.|$|R
40|$|Categorical <b>coverages</b> <b>are</b> {{popular for}} the {{presentation}} of thematic data in cartographic form and have gained widespread use. Routines for their preparation are included in most GIS software. Categorical <b>coverages</b> <b>are</b> simple to implement and easy to understand. The popularity of the categorical <b>coverage</b> <b>is</b> {{closely related to the}} intuitive rules that determine its behavior. This paper presents a formalization of these rules based on the concepts of a partition of space and the refinement of such partitions of space. A family of categorical <b>coverages</b> <b>is</b> defined as all categorical <b>coverages</b> that can <b>be</b> produced from a data set through aggregations of categories. It is shown that categorical <b>coverages</b> <b>are</b> partially ordered by 'refinement'of partitions. This ordering is preserved in the mapping from the ordering of the partition of the attribute domain to the partition of space. This formalization is not only useful for implementors of GIS, but the list of possible operations and their pro [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Table  3, Panel D {{shows the}} {{respective}} correlation coefficients. <b>Coverage</b> <b>is</b> {{positively correlated with}} AbsDVA, in line with a higher likelihood of press <b>coverage</b> when DVAs <b>are</b> large. <b>Coverage</b> <b>is</b> also positively correlated with all measures of managers’ DVA reporting, consistent with an association between managers’ and the press’ DVA reporting.|$|R
5|$|The general {{first degree}} (for Magister) centred on the {{teaching}} of philosophy, theology and Greek under the conservative Scholasticism which gave prime place {{to the authority of}} Aristotle. Although the trivium was now augmented by the quadrivium (Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Music), their <b>coverage</b> <b>was</b> neglected in comparison with theology and philosophy and consequently Mercator would have to resort to further study of the first three subjects in years to come. Mercator graduated Magister in 1532.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone4S (retroactively stylized with a {{lowercase}} 's' as iPhone 4s as of September 2013) is a smartphone {{that was}} designed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the fifth generation of the iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 4 and preceding the iPhone 5. Announced on October 4, 2011 at Apple's Cupertino campus, its media <b>coverage</b> <b>was</b> accompanied by news {{of the death of}} former Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs on the following day.|$|E
5|$|For {{five years}} after the {{expansion}} era contract with ESPN ended in 1997, the CFL was absent on American television. At the end of 2001 the league began a relationship with America One that would last until 2009. <b>Coverage</b> <b>was</b> relatively generous with 43 games, including the playoffs, covered in the last year. A more modest deal of 14 games was negotiated with the NFL Network in 2010, which lasted two years. The 2012 season began without a contract and the league resorted to internet broadcasts on ESPN3 until NBC Sports Network agreed to a 14-game regular season package of its own; unlike the NFL network, NBC opted to broadcast games during the NFL preseason as well as cover the playoffs and Grey Cup. Both the NBC and ESPN deals were renewed in 2013 with a slight scaling back of playoff coverage and ESPN2 also picking up a handful of games in the summer months. American broadcasts have been simulcasts of game coverage from Canadian networks.|$|E
