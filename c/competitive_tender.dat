40|$|<b>Competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> {{of local}} public {{transport}} services has been allowed in Norway since 1994. By 2005, 28 percent of all route production in Norway was procured {{on the basis of}} tendered contracts, covering around 40 percent of all passengers. The majority of the tendered contracts were gross cost contracts, whereas historically, most Norwegian contracts have been net cost contracts. This article analyses the effect of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> on operating cost and subsidies paid. It is found that <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> reduces costs by 10 percent and that most of the cost reduction has been used to reduce subsidies for public transport by local authorities. The effects of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> in Norway are smaller compared to other countries. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that the industry had improved efficiency over a long period before <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> was introduced...|$|R
40|$|Compulsory <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> (CCT) of blue-collar {{services}} such as refuse collection and street cleaning {{was introduced in the}} UK by the Local Government Act 1988.

Whilst the issue of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> of public services has generated a substantial literature over recent years (see Domberger and Rimmer (1994) for a review), there have been relatively few studies of compulsory <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering.</b> 2 This paper uses a dataset on refuse collection costs and services for the 365 English local authorities over the period 1984 - 94.

These panel estimates suggest that previous studies have likely over-estimated the cost-savings associated with <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering.</b> The findings also suggest that the lower costs associated with <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> {{have more to do}} with auction theory than with any intrinsic efficiency of the private sector...|$|R

40|$|A key {{attribute}} of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> for the periodic selection of operators of subsidised public transport services is {{to secure the}} provision of specified services at efficient cost levels. This has proved particularly effective where services were previously provided by an inefficient monopoly operator. The arguments for the adoption of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> in preference to negotiation with the incumbent operator may be less clear-cut in other cases. Consideration is given to both theoretical and practical insights into {{the relative merits of}} <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> and negotiation approaches in such situations. The limited literature on the topic is reviewed and insights and lessons identified. Influencing issues include prior conditions, the nature of the supplier market, features of contracts, negotiating and <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> strategies and practice, accountability and transparency, and long-term market implications. The evidence suggests that [`]one size does not fit all', and the choice will depend on specific circumstances. The relative merits of the two approaches for renewal of bus contracts are considered with regard to Adelaide, for contracts which have previously been awarded through <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering.</b> The paper draws out the main factors that could influence the authority's choice between the options, and discusses the relevance of the findings to other situations. <b>Competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> Negotiated contracts Bus service contracts Contracting model Transaction costs Efficient pricing Supplier market...|$|R
40|$|Workshop 1 was {{concerned}} {{to identify the}} real results of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering,</b> and experience {{on how to make}} it work better, using evidence from the rail and bus sectors in a large number of countries spread around the world. It was found that <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> had generally been successful in terms of quality and costs, but problems had occurred in a number of cases, so careful attention must be paid to the design of tendering exercises, details of the contract, risk-sharing arrangements and the approach to any re-negotiation found to be necessary. As a result, an important conclusion is that the tendering authority needs a high degree of expertise in these issues; any thought that <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> relieves the public authority of the need for expertise in public transport is mistaken. <b>Competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> Rail Bus Contracts Risk sharing Re-negotiation...|$|R

The company was {{selected}} following a <b>competitive</b> <b>tender</b> in May 1977, with contract negotiations completed on 3 November 1977. Construction of Tobruk formally began on 7 February 1978, when the ship's keel was laid. Tobruk was launched on 1 March 1980 by Lady Anna Cowen, wife of Governor General Zelman Cowen. The ship left the dockyard {{for the first time}} in December 1980: her construction had been delayed by over four months by industrial disputes, and her final cost of A$59 million was 42 percent greater than originally estimated. The ship's sea trials were conducted in early 1981 off Newcastle and Port Stephens by a joint Navy-Army-civilian crew, and fitting out was completed on 7 April 1981. Tobruk was handed over to the Navy on 11 April 1981 and was commissioned at Newcastle on 23 April. The ship's name had been selected in 1976 and refers to the Siege of Tobruk during World War II, in which the RAN's 'Scrap Iron Flotilla' supplied the besieged 9th Australian Division.

40|$|Most {{countries}} {{contemplating the}} introduction of competition-based organizational forms did not perceive the British deregulated bus regime {{to be the way}} forward. A deeper analysis of facts and an international coverage of the local successes of that regime remained marginal and, as a result, the reputation of deregulated regimes remained bad or - at best - a contentious issue. The rush for <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> was further stimulated by the European Commission's endeavour to enact a Regulation that put forward <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> of exclusive contracts as the preferred way to organise local public transport markets. Yet, as discussed in this workshop, deregulation in various guises may well play a growing role in local and regional transport.

2500|$|An acute {{question}} for the TUPE Regulations, particularly in the years when the Conservative government was implementing a policy of shrinking {{the size of the}} public sector, was the extent they applied to jobs being outsourced, typically by a public body, like a local council, or changed between businesses in a <b>competitive</b> <b>tender</b> process for public procurement. On this point a series of ECJ decisions came to the view {{that there could be a}} relevant transfer, covered by the Directive, even where there was no contractual link between a transferor and a transferee business, so long as the business entity retained its [...] "identity". In turn the [...] "identity" [...] of a business would be determined by the degree to which the business' factors of production remained the same before and after a sale. It could be that no employees were hired after an asset sale, but the sacked employees would still have a claim because all their old workplace and capital equipment was being used by the new employer. It is also relevant to what extent a business is capital or labour-intensive. So in Oy Liikenne Ab v Liskojärvi the ECJ held that it was unlikely that 45 Helsinki bus drivers' contracts were transferred, between the company that lost the contract and the new bus company that won it, even though 33 drivers were rehired, because [...] "bus transport cannot be regarded as an activity based essentially on manpower". On the other hand, employees will benefit when a new employer offers old staff their jobs, the intention to rehire makes it more likely the court will deem there to be a transfer.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we aim to}} {{estimate}} the effect of contract renewal as well as <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> on public transport costs, subsidies, and ridership. More specifically, we examine to what extent (multiple) contract renewals and introduction of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> for long-term public transport contracts affect ridership, operational costs and subsidies in concession areas governed by public transportation authorities from 2001 until 2013 in the Netherlands. Our identification strategy improves on the literature as {{we are able to}} control for all time-invariant unobserved factors, such as network and area characteristics by using panel data. We show that when renewing long-term contracts, operational costs are reduced by at least 10 %, whereas subsidies fall even stronger. For contracts that are renewed at least twice, the reduction in costs is even more substantial and in the order of 16 %. We find that the effect of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> is completely absent, suggesting that the threat of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> is sufficient in a market where the majority of concessions is <b>competitive</b> <b>tendered.</b> Contract renewal not only reduces costs and subsidies, but simultaneously increases public transport ridership by 7. 7 %. Furthermore the vehicle-hours elasticity of operational costs is 0. 40, pointing to strong economies of density. The geographical scale elasticity of operational costs is around one, which indicates constant returns to scale with respect to the geographical size of the concession area. This suggest that the current size of the Dutch concession area is optimal with respect to costs...|$|R
