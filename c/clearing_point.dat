[...] During the auction process participating dealers (e.g., the big investment banks) submit prices at which they would buy and sell the reference entity's debt obligations, as well as net requests for physical settlement against par. [...] A second stage Dutch auction is held following the publication of the initial midpoint of the dealer markets and what is the net open interest to deliver or be delivered actual bonds or loans. [...] The final <b>clearing</b> <b>point</b> of this auction sets the final price for cash settlement of all CDS contracts and all physical settlement requests as well as matched limit offers resulting from the auction are actually settled. [...] According to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), who organised them, auctions have recently proved an effective way of settling the very large volume of outstanding CDS contracts written on companies such as Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual. Commentator Felix Salmon, however, has questioned in advance ISDA's ability to structure an auction, as defined to date, to set compensation associated with a 2012 bond swap in Greek government debt.

50|$|Normally {{this is done}} by visual {{observation}} of the signalman, although occasionally verbal confirmation, a tail lamp camera or tail light plunger {{can be used to}} verify the train passed the <b>clearing</b> <b>point</b> complete.

5000|$|The {{requirement}} to send [...] "Train Out Of Section" [...] is that train {{has passed the}} <b>clearing</b> <b>point</b> complete with tail lamp attached. The tail lamp is a physical indication that the train was complete — that is, {{that it has not}} become divided in the section, leaving a portion behind (although in reality, almost all modern trains are fully fitted with continuous brakes, and hence both portions of a divided train would come to a stand if separated).|$|E
50|$|A {{hospital}} {{camp was}} built by the British Army at Hergest, which later acted as a <b>clearing</b> <b>point</b> for two general hospitals built by the US Army in 1943. The first dedicated hospital train arrived shortly after the Battle of Dunkirk in 1940. After the US Army Artillery arrived in late 1943, the camp had received 11 hospital trains for one hospital, carrying up to 300 patients per train. Between 4 January and 28 April 1945, the other hospital had received 10 trains and admitted 2,413 patients. All the hospital trains arrived from Southampton.|$|E
50|$|The <b>clearing</b> <b>point</b> {{is usually}} defined by some obvious marker - at some wayside locations, it {{may simply be}} the {{starting}} signal in the same direction, whilst at others it may be another signal, or require a track circuit to be clear. Additionally, no two clearing points may overlap - for example, at junctions with conflicting movements, the points should be set so that, should each train fail to stop, they would not collide. Similarly, a full 1/2 mile m must be given for trains approaching {{each other on the}} same track—1/4 mile m for each train.|$|E

5000|$|When the GWR goods passed Button's 'clearing point' signal (the {{end of the}} section) at 5:13 am, it {{released}} the treadle and thus allowed the section from Berkeley road to Charfield to be cleared. He then shouted to Gilbert and Sutton of the goods train to shunt and 'pulled off' his shunting disc signal. At this time, nothing {{was out of the}} ordinary. It was less than an hour before dawn, and the railway tracks were shrouded with fog. Due to the fog, Button could not see his down distant signal or his down outer home signal (both were connected to electrical repeaters which showed the signal position via an instrument in his box), but he could see his 'fog object' and therefore saw no need to call out fogmen. The section from Berkeley Road to Charfield was clear, and therefore Button could accept the LMS night mail from Smith. He was perfectly justified in doing so, given that had {{a quarter of a mile}} clear between the <b>clearing</b> <b>point</b> signal and his outer home signal (the first [...] "stop" [...] signal controlled by Charfield box)- there was plenty of space for the mail to stop. The station, however, was occupied by the shunting goods train and therefore his signals stood at danger. He accepted the mail at 5:14 am.|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} properties and phase transitions of thermotropic liquid crystals are highly sensitive to {{small changes in}} chemical structure. However, these changes are challenging to model, as both the phase diagram and mesophase properties obtained from fully atomistic simulations are strongly dependent on the force field model employed, and {{the current generation of}} chemical force fields has not proved accurate enough to provide reliable predictions of transition temperatures for many liquid crystals. This paper presents a strategy for improving the nematic <b>clearing</b> <b>point,</b> TNI, in atomistic simulations, by systematic optimization of the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) for key mesogenic fragments. We show that with careful optimization of the parameters describing a series of liquid crystal fragment molecules, it is possible to transfer these parameters to larger liquid crystal molecules and make accurate predictions for nematic mesophase formation. This new force field, GAFF-LCFF, is used to predict the nematic-isotropic <b>clearing</b> <b>point</b> to within 5 °C for the nematogen 1, 3 -benzenedicarboxylic acid, 1, 3 -bis(4 -butylphenyl) ester, an improvement of 60 °C over the standard GAFF force field...|$|E
