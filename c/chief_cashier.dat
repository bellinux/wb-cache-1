5|$|The notes had 150 minor marks that {{acted as}} {{security}} measures to identify forgeries. These were often {{assumed to be}} printing errors, and were changed between issues of notes. Each note bore an alphanumeric serial designation and the signature of the <b>Chief</b> <b>Cashier</b> of the Bank of England. Prior {{to the release of}} any notes by the Bank of England, all serial numbers were recorded in ledgers so the bank could verify its liabilities; these numbers were checked when the notes circulated back through the bank.|$|E
5|$|On , 1889, the Land Run saw the {{founding}} of Norman, with at least 150 residents spending the night in makeshift campsites; {{by the next morning}} a downtown was already being constructed. Almost immediately two prominent Norman businessmen, former Purcell railroad freight agent Delbert Larsh and railroad station <b>chief</b> <b>cashier</b> Thomas Waggoner, began lobbying for the territorial government to locate its first university in Norman. The two were interested in growing the city and had reasoned that, rather than try to influence legislatures to locate the heavily contested territory capital in Norman, it made sense to attempt to secure the state's first university instead (a move that would be far less controversial). On , 1890, Larsh and Waggoner were successful with the passage of Council Bill 114, establishing the University of Oklahoma in Norman approximately 18 years before Oklahoma statehood.|$|E
5|$|Aberdeen-born John Alexander and William Mossman {{were the}} leading {{portrait}} {{artists of the}} first half of the century. John Alexander was born in Aberdeen and was a great grandson of portrait painter George Jamesone. He studied in London and Rome, returning to Scotland about 1720. His younger contemporary William Mossman (1700–71) was also from Aberdeen and studied in Rome. Both worked predominately in the north-east around their home city, but also painted many of the figures of early-Enlightenment Edinburgh. Alexander's best known work included the portrait of George Drummond the Lord Provost of Edinburgh (1756), who had been responsible for the creation of the New Town in Edinburgh and the Royal Infirmary, which is shown in the background of the painting. Mosman's work included his portrait of John Campbell of the Bank (1749), who was <b>chief</b> <b>cashier</b> of the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Whig, but who is depicted in the recently forbidden Highland Dress. Because of his Jacobite sympathies Alexander was forced to leave for the continent after the rebellion of 1745, and in Rome he made a living painting the Jacobite expatriates who congregated there, before his return a few years later.|$|E
50|$|On his death, {{his huge}} fortune of {{over one million}} pounds was left to his sister Jane Innes. It was the largest ever {{inheritance}} in Scotland {{at that time and}} equates to around £80 million in modern terms. When Jane died childless and without a will in 1839 a scramble for the fortune began amongst his numerous illegitimate children. The bulk of his estate ultimately passed to his nephew (a second sister’s son) William Mitchell <b>cashier</b> (<b>Chief</b> Executive) of the Royal Bank of Scotland 1814 to 1825 who thereafter was known as William Mitchell-Innes. William’s son was Gilbert Mitchell-Innes, named after his wealthy great uncle.|$|R
5000|$|Kiong Seok Wee ( [...] ; 1839-1888) was the {{grandson}} of Kiong Kong Tuan and son of Spirits Farmer Choa Chong Long. He did not fancy spirit farming and instead went into business with his brother-in-law, Wee Bin, but the partnership was short-lived. In 1865 along with Wee Leong Hin, the firm of Leong Hin, Seok Wee & Co., chop Aik Ho, shipchandlers, was established at Boat Quay and another under the chop Joo Chin & Co. as General Merchants. [...] "Aik Ho" [...] was accidentally burnt down, and as it was not covered by insurance, Mr. Seok Wee sustained a severe loss which was augmented {{by the failure of}} Joo Chin & Co. He was at that time one of the proprietors of the Singapore Daily Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser. In 1869 the affairs of Mr. Seok Wee and his partner were administered by the Court of Insolvent Debtors. He died in 1888 at the age of 49 years leaving six sons and two daughters, the elder of whom, Ms Kiong Hoon Neo, became a daughter-in-law of Mr. Tan Kim Ching (she married his son Tan Keck Geang). The youngest son of Mr. Seok Wee is Kiong Ching Eng, <b>chief</b> clerk and <b>cashier</b> at the General Hospital, a man of liberal education and a first-class player both in tennis and chess.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{internal}} PSD debates {{that followed the}} start of World War I, Wexler disagreed with the party's support for the resolutions of the Zimmerwald Conference. Specifically, he concluded that the call to overthrow capitalism in case of war was not applicable to Romania, which had not yet fully experienced a [...] "bourgeois-democratic revolution". After Romania entered the war {{on the side of}} Entente, Wexler was mobilized as <b>chief</b> accountant and <b>cashier</b> in an Iaşi enterprise. In 1917 he welcomed the Russian February Revolution, and, along with Bujor, took part in the May Day parade organized by revolutionary Russian soldiers in the city. As a result, two days later his mobilization order was overturned and he was drafted into the active army duty, despite his age and failing health. Suspected of taking part in Rakovsky's escape during the demonstrations, he was brought under armed escort before the court martial in Bacău. Briefly released and sent back to Iaşi, he was soon placed under the guard of the 2nd Huntsmen Regiment. There, on the night of May 14, he was sent towards the local command post, under an escort headed by Lieutenant Romalo, close friend of the Romanian heir apparent, Carol. On the way, while passing through a forest, Wexler was shot {{in the back of his}} head by one of the guards, ostensibly because he was attempting to escape custody. According to the socialist press, his assassination had been planned by the military authorities with the acknowledgement of the PNL leadership, and his killer was rewarded with a bottle of rum, an insignificant amount of money, and promotion to the rank of sergeant.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} with banks was over-issuance of banknotes. These were redeemable in specie (gold or silver) upon presentation to the <b>chief</b> <b>cashier</b> of the bank. When people lost trust in a bank they rushed to redeem its notes, and because banks issued more notes than their specie reserves, the bank couldn't redeem the notes, often causing the bank to fail. In 1860 there were over 8,000 state chartered banks issuing notes. In 1861 the U.S. began issuing United States Notes as legal tender.|$|E
25|$|Crawford's {{acting career}} took off again after he {{appeared}} on the London stage in the farce No Sex Please, We're British, in which he played the part of frantic <b>chief</b> <b>cashier</b> Brian Runnicles. His performance led to an invitation to star in a BBC television comedy series about a childlike and eternally haphazard man who causes disaster everywhere he goes. Crawford {{was not the first}} choice for the role of Frank Spencer in Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em. Originally, the part had been offered to comedy actor Ronnie Barker but after he and Norman Wisdom had turned it down, Crawford took on the challenge, adopting a similar characterisation to that which he used when playing Brian Runnicles. Cast alongside him was actress Michele Dotrice in the role of Frank's long-suffering wife, Betty, and the series premiered in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Sebastiano Biancardi, as he {{was then}} known, was born in Naples to Caterina (née Amendola) and Michele Biancardi. His father's family were {{originally}} merchants from Milan who had moved to Naples in the Middle Ages. At the age of 11 months, he was adopted by Fulvio Caracciolo, {{a member of a}} Neapolitan noble family and the second son of the Duke of Martina. Under Caracciolo he was educated in law and literature and was exposed to many prominent Neapolitan intellectuals, such as Giambattista Vico, who frequented the house. His adoptive father died in 1692, leaving Biancardi as his sole heir. At the age of 18, with both his natural and adoptive parents dead, he married Giustina Baroni. According to a late 18th-century biography of Lalli by Eustachio D'Afflitto, she was the sister of the Bishop of Calvi. By 1700, Biancardi had gone through most of his inheritance and with an ever-growing family to support took up a post as <b>chief</b> <b>cashier</b> at the bank of the Santissima Annunziata.|$|E

Margery Thompson met him when she was a schoolgirl and he became part of her family circle.

[...] In the 1950s he visited friends at Cleator Moor in Cumberland (where Geoffrey Bennett was the manager at the Westminster Bank) and Southampton (where Margery Thompson had moved after her marriage). He painted pictures of the bank in Cleator Moor, Southampton Floating Bridge and other scenes local to his friends' homes.|$|E
