50|$|In 1833, Dumas {{developed}} {{a method for}} estimating the amount of nitrogen in an organic compound, founding modern analysis methods. He made important revisions to the existing combustion methods with a sophisticated pneumatic trough. These revisions were the flushing of the <b>combustion</b> <b>tube</b> with carbon dioxide {{and the addition of}} potassium hydroxide in the pneumatic trough. Flushing with carbon dioxide eliminated the nitrogen present in the air that previously occupied the <b>combustion</b> <b>tube,</b> eliminating the need for correction due to nitrogen in the air. The potassium hydroxide dissolved the passing carbon dioxide gas, which left nitrogen as the only gas in the collection tube.|$|E
50|$|Gasoline heaters require {{electricity}} to operate. Heaters were made compatible with 6-volt, 12-volt, and 24-volt automotive and aircraft electrical systems. The heater requires routine maintenance, such as regular {{inspection of the}} <b>combustion</b> <b>tube,</b> and replacement of the igniter at periodic intervals.|$|E
50|$|Gott {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan in 1887 to Edward Alonzo Gott and Stephanie Ortman. He {{attended}} Detroit University School, a predecessor of University Liggett School in Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering from the University of Michigan in 1909. At the University of Michigan, Gott conducted research into rapid-cooling electrically heated <b>combustion</b> <b>tubes.</b> After graduation, Gott worked for the Griffin Wheel Company at its Pullman and Tacoma plants, before becoming the agent of his cousin William Boeing's lumber business in 1915.|$|R
50|$|First, fuel {{is brought}} to the heater using piping from a fuel tank, or taps into the vehicle’s fuel system. A fan blows air into a {{combustion}} chamber, and a spark plug or ignition device lights the gasoline/air mixture. A built-in safety switch prevents fuel from flowing unless the fan is working. Outside the combustion chamber, a second, larger diameter tube conducts air around the <b>combustion</b> <b>tube's</b> outer surface, and a second fan blows the warmed air into tubing to direct it towards {{the interior of the}} vehicle. Most gasoline heaters produce between 5,000 and 50,000 BTU per hour.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith the {{improvement}} of energy utilization rate, {{there is a growing}} attention on the utilization of gas having low calorific value, therefore, the double-regenerative radiant <b>tube</b> <b>combustion</b> technology comes into being accordingly. This paper presents the necessity of double-regenerative radiant <b>tube</b> <b>combustion</b> technology applied in roller-hearth type normalizing furnace, based on the characteristics of heat treatment process as well as the work principle of regenerative combustion. By building a combustion mathematical model, the numerical simulation on combustion process of double-regenerative radiant tube is made, and the distribution of temperature field and speed field of radiant tube is studied, it provides a basis for the application of double-regenerative radiant <b>tube</b> <b>combustion</b> technology...|$|R
50|$|Oxidation of {{the sample}} is {{complete}} after injection into the furnace, turning oxidizable material in the sample into gaseous form. A carbon-free carrier gas transports the CO2, through a moisture trap and halide scrubbers to remove water vapor and halides from the gas stream before it reaches the detector. These substances can interfere with the detection of the CO2 gas. The HTCO method {{may be useful in}} those applications where difficult to oxidize compounds, or high molecular weight organics, are present as it provides almost complete oxidation of organics including solids and particulates small enough to be injected into the furnace. The major drawback of HTCO analysis is its unstable baseline resulting from the gradual accumulation of non-volatile residues within the <b>combustion</b> <b>tube.</b> These residues continuously change TOC background levels requiring continuous background correction. Because aqueous samples are injected directly into a very hot, usually quartz, furnace only small aliquots (less than 2 milliliters and usually less than 400 micro-liters) of sample can be handled making the methods less sensitive than chemical oxidation methods capable of digesting as much as 10 times more sample. Also, the salt content {{of the sample}}s do not combust, and so therefore, gradually build a residue inside the <b>combustion</b> <b>tube</b> eventually clogging the catalyst resulting in poor peak shapes, and degraded accuracy or precision, unless appropriate maintenance procedures are followed. The catalyst should be regenerated or replaced as needed. To avoid this problem the manufacturing industry has developed several concepts, such as matrix separation, ceramic reactors, better process control or methods without catalysts.|$|E
5000|$|At the 22nd Paris Motor Show, Deguingand {{exhibited}} a smaller model, {{now in the}} 5CV car tax band, using a two-stroke 4-cylinder unit designed by Marcel Violet whose two-stroke engine designs were at this time appearing {{in a number of}} cars produced in the Paris region. [...] The engine in the Deguingand 5CV was unusual in that the four cylinders operated in just two combustion chambers, the pistons being placed in pairs, one at each end of a shared <b>combustion</b> <b>tube.</b> [...] The car sat on a 2430 mm wheel base and was aggressively priced at just 11,000 francs in October 1928. [...] It nevertheless failed to find customers and disappeared at the end of 1929. [...] The same basic design nevertheless reappeared in 1931, now manufactured in Nanterre as a Donnet.|$|E
5000|$|The Steamexfire {{is driven}} by a jet engine, in which air is {{compressed}} into a combustion chamber where fuel (kerosene) is injected. The flammable mixture of fuel and air is ignited by a sparkplug, and the gases expand {{as a result of}} the combustion process. The gases are forced into a turbine which drives a compressor.The exhaust gas of a jet engine contains approx. 17% oxygen [...]In a second stage combustion chamber, more fuel is injected and ignited. As a result of this process, all oxygen is consumed, and what remains is an inert gas.This process takes place in a 7 meter long <b>combustion</b> <b>tube,</b> which is cooled by water. The heated water is injected at the end of the cooling tube, and consequently the water is turned into water vapor and steam.As a result, the Steamexfire produces up to 25 cubic meters of inert steam and water vapor per second.The fore runner of the Steamexfire is called the GAG unit.|$|E
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century Heraeus became a pioneer in the automatization of combustion analysis for the determination of non-metallic elements like carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, hydrogen and oxygen in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and environmental samples. This development was made possible through the experience gained in the high temperature furnace technology needed for melting of platinum, which has a high melting point of 1770 degrees Celsius. Building on the know-how in handling high temperatures for chemical processes, Richard Küch, a researcher at the Heraeus Platinum Smelting Factory, was able to produce quartz glass of very high purity, which is still the material of choice for <b>combustion</b> <b>tubes</b> used in modern combustion analyzers. Richard Küch’s invention together with the experience in high temperature furnace technology resulted in the commercial production of automated and semi-automated elemental analyzers. Due to the too low profitability and different nature compared to the precious metal core business of Heraeus, the Analytical Technology Division was sold in 1995 to form Elementar.|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} to evaluate each step in radiocarbon analysis {{to ensure that the}} whole process is as efficient and accurate as possible. Aerosol filter samples contain a myriad of carbonaceous compounds with varying resistance to oxidation. Complete combustion of the sample is thus of great importance to ensure that the graphitized sample is representative of the original filter sample. We have evaluated sealed <b>tube</b> <b>combustion</b> of mu g-sized aerosol samples using different types and amounts of reagents. Successful analysis of aerosol samples as small as 20 mu g C was possible following small changes to our standard on-line method.

50|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge facing}} nineteenth century organic chemists {{was the lack}} of instruments and methods of analysis to support accurate, replicable analyses of organic materials. Many chemists worked on the problem of organic analysis, including French Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Swedish Jöns Jacob Berzelius, before Liebig developed his version of an apparatus for determining the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen content of organic substances in 1830. It involved an ingenious array of five glass bulbs, called a Kaliapparat to trap the oxidation product of the carbon in the sample, following combustion of the sample. Before reaching the kaliapparat, the combustion gases were conducted through a tube of hygroscopic calcium chloride, which absorbed and retained the oxidation product of the hydrogen of the sample, namely water vapor. Next, in the kaliaparat, Carbon dioxide was absorbed in a potassium hydroxide solution in the three lower bulbs, and used to measure the weight of carbon in the sample. For any substance consisting only of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, the percentage of oxygen was found by subtracting the carbon and hydrogen percentages from 100 percent; the remainder must be the percentage of oxygen. A charcoal furnace (a sheet-steel tray in which the <b>combustion</b> <b>tube</b> was laid) was used for the combustion. Weighing carbon and hydrogen directly, rather than estimating them volumetrically, greatly increased the method's accuracy of measurement. Liebig's assistant Carl Ettling perfected glass-blowing techniques for producing the kaliapparat, and demonstrated them to visitors. Liebig's kaliapparat simplified the technique of quantitative organic analysis and rendered it routine. Brock suggests that the availability of a superior technical apparatus was one reason why Liebig was able to attract so many students to his laboratory. His method of combustion analysis was used pharmaceutically, and certainly made possible many contributions to organic, agricultural and biological chemistry.|$|E

40|$|When a gas is {{compressed}} rapidly, its temperature will increase. This {{process is}} known as adiabatic compression. You’ve probably noticed this effect while inflating a bicycle tire. The increase in temperature results from the work being done on the gas. Pushing on the gas increases the kinetic energy of the gas molecules. This increase in internal energy manifests itself as an increase in temperature. The rapid compression reduces {{the amount of energy}} lost to the environment. In a diesel engine, air is compressed adiabatically. This compression raises the temperature inside the cylinder to the flash point of the fuel mixture. The diesel engine differs from the gasoline engine by using adiabatic compression to ignite the fuel rather than a spark plug. The fire syringe provides a rather dramatic way of demonstrating the heating of a gas, in this case air, that accompanies rapid compression. With this fire syringe, the air can reach a temperature of over 260 degrees C (500 degrees F). As cotton fibers burn at 235 degrees C (454 degrees F), a small piece of cotton fiber placed {{at the bottom of the}} <b>combustion</b> <b>tube</b> will ignite. USING THE FIRE SYRINGE: Note: Prior to use, ensure that the seal is tight. To do this, place the piston 2 - 3 cm into the <b>combustion</b> <b>tube.</b> Depress the piston as far as possible and then release it. The piston should spring back almost to the end of the <b>combustion</b> <b>tube.</b> If this does not occur, the O-rings may need to be greased with silicone lubricant to ensure a tight seal. Once the syringe is ready, follow these steps for proper use: 1. Put on protective eyewear. 2. With a paper towel, dry the inside of the <b>combustion</b> <b>tube.</b> 3. Place a small piece of cotton fiber in the bottom of the <b>combustion</b> <b>tube.</b> 4. Insert the end of the piston part way into the <b>combustion</b> <b>tube...</b>|$|E

Albumins from 18 species and albumens from chicken and turkey egg were obtained from a commercial source and shown to be of > 98 % purity by capillary zone electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography. One microliter of an aqueous protein solution with a total of < 40 -pmol protein (2. 5 μg), which contained about 150 -nmol C, was injected directly into a flowing stream of high-performance liquid chromatography grade water. The solution passed through a pneumatic nebulizer, was sprayed onto a moving wire, passed through a drying oven, and was combusted in a furnace. After the water of combustion was removed, the resulting CO 2 gas was directed to a high precision IRMS instrument operated in continuous flow mode.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} novel {{experimental results}} for the combustion of liquid bio-fuels in an internal circulating fluidized bed (ICFB). A 20 kW experimental facility equipped with an air-assisted injector has been used. Reliable operation, high combustion efficiency and limited temperature increase along the <b>combustion</b> riser <b>tube</b> have been attained at different operating conditions. However, CO emission has been rather higher than expected. A form of micro-explosive behaviour of the fuel has been experienced at relatively low bed temperatures (710 ¿ 730 ¿C), but this behaviour was significantly less intense than in bubbling fluidized beds. A mathematical model of the combustion of liquid fuels has been adapted to ICFB conditions. The comparison between model and experimental results demonstrates that the efficiency of fuel-air mixing has a crucial role on combustion behaviour. Poor contact between air and fuel in {{the bottom half of}} the riser is responsible for high CO levels measured during the experiments.

40|$|Investigations of {{the effect}} of {{recirculation}} on the stability of a small scale <b>combustion</b> <b>tube</b> have been carried out in an attempt to substantiate a theory developed by D.

In the original arrangement, recirculation was obtained by means of a jet facing upstream, some results were obtained and estimations of induced reverse flow were attempted. Because of the many unknown and uncontrollable factors this method was eventually abandoned in favor of an adapter which brought the recirculating air up to the burner itself. Tests under these conditions show qualitative agreement with the theory over part of the range covered by the tests. The agreement may be expressed as follows: 1. An increase in recirculation improves stability. 2. A given increase in recirculation has a much greater effect at low absolute values of recirculation than at higher ones. The influence of factors other than recirculation, on stability, is described.

40|$|In-Situ Combustion (ISC) is a {{very complex}} thermal {{recovery}} process that is strongly affected by the chemical composition and physical properties of reservoir rock and fluids. Stability of the process depends on the amount of heat continuously generated from the chemical reactions between fuel formed during ISC and injected oxygen. Heat generation depends on the amount of fuel formed, which, in turn, is affected by initial oil saturation (IOS). Thus, in this study, ISC process dynamics were investigated at various saturations on 7. 5 ?API Peace River bitumen, under 3. 4 l/min air injection rate. Through one-dimensional <b>combustion</b> <b>tube</b> experiments higher combustion front temperatures were observed for increased IOS. The degree of bitumen upgrading was determined in terms of viscosity and API gravity changes. Correlations for hydrogen-carbon ratio, air requirement, consumed fuel, and combustion front velocity were obtained. Good burning characteristics of Peace River bitumen resulted in stable self-sustained combustion with 26. 01 % IOS. However, an experiment with 13. 39 % IOS failed because of insufficient fuel generation. Furthermore, X-Ray cross-sectional images were taken along the <b>combustion</b> <b>tube</b> after each run to support and enhance the interpretation of experimental results.

40|$|In-situ {{combustion}} (ISC), {{also known}} as fire flooding, {{is not a new}} thermal enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique. It is a potential alternative for heavy oil production when other thermal EOR methods are not adequate in certain reservoir conditions. A number of successful ISC application examples have been amply covered in the literature; however, the technique is still not widely used. Additional research on the influence of heterogeneities on ISC performance is required to improve predictability of this promising EOR technique. To investigate the influence of initial water saturation on ISC performance, seven <b>combustion</b> <b>tube</b> experiments were conducted. The experimental investigations were performed on a Canadian bitumen sample (7. 5 oAPI) from the Peace River region.
