Methods: The uncured resin was polymerized in an experimental composite inlay processing chamber under a pressurized nitrogen atmosphere maintained at 551. 6 KPa and light-activated for one complete cycle at 125 °C for 10 minutes. The resin blocks were sectioned occluso-gingivally into multiple 0. 9 x 0. 9 x 5 mm resin beams, and immersed in 50 % basic, ammoniacal silver nitrate for 24 hours, exposed to a photodeveloping solution and prepared for transmission electron microscopy. The percentage distributions of silver deposits were compared using Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ranks and Dunn's multiple comparison tests.

On the other hand, in situ hybridization (ISH) revealed the appearance of positive cells exhibiting mRNA for the α 1 chain of rat type I collagen {{two to three weeks}} after the onset of PHN in all glomeruli of all rats. Positive cells persisted for at least eight weeks. In many glomeruli, the location of the <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> grains suggested that they were in visceral epithelial cells.

Simultaneous staining with cytochrome c-conjugated anti-H- 1 immunoglobulin G was performed to ensure that cells incorporating [3 H]thymidine (2 - to 60 -min pulses) were H- 1 infected. The sites of H- 1 replicative-form (in ts 1 -infected cells) and progeny (in wild-type-infected cells) DNA synthesis were identical. Immunospecifically labeled nuclei at the earliest stages of infection exhibited dense <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> grains over material extruded from nucleolar fibrillar centers.

In late phases of infection, the heterochromatin became completely marginated, and the nucleoplasm contained only euchromatin that exhibited randomly distributed sites of H- 1 DNA replication. This indicates that H- 1 DNA synthesis begins at localized euchromatic or nucleolar sites and then spreads outward. Immunostained heterochromatin and nucleolar chromatin never incorporated [3 H]thymidine.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{obstacles}} {{in the study of}} gas phase metal clusters is their high temperature. Even cooling in a seeded beam is only of limited used, since the condensation continuously releases energy into the system. As a consequence, spectroscopic studies of free metal clusters typically yield broad structures, which are interpreted as plasma resonances of a free electron gas. An experiment on ionic sodium clusters has shown that low temperatures lead to a narrowing of the absorption bands and the appearance of additional structure, that can not be explained within the free electron model. Thus the need for cold clusters is evident. In principle the deposition of metal clusters into inert matrices eliminates the temperature problem but it can also inflict strong changes on the electronic spectra. Droplets of liquid helium serve as a much more gentle matrix that avoids many of the above problems. In this thesis the new technique of helium droplet spectroscopy is presented as a tool for the study of extremely cold metal clusters. <b>Clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> up to a mass greater than 7000 amu have been produced by pickup of single atoms by a beam of helium droplets. The droplets are formed in a supersonic expansion. The cluster's binding energy is removed by evaporative cooling and the system remains at 0. 4 K. The doped droplets are probed by laser spectroscopy with a depletion technique or resonant two photon ionization. We were able to measure the first UV absorption spectrum of metal atoms (silver) inside helium droplets. Another experiment shows that {{a small fraction of the}} captured silver atoms resides on the surface of the droplet like alkali atoms. In a two photon process previously unobserved s- and d-Rydberg states of the free silver atom (20 left angle n left angle 80) were excited. The silver atoms, initially embedded in the helium droplets, are found to move to the surface and desorb when excited to the broadened 5 p level. This is the first result showing laser induced movement of a foreign atom from the inside to the surface of a nano-droplet of superfluid helium. (orig.) 160 refs.

3000|$|Monolayer-protected quantum {{clusters}} (QCs) {{composed of}} a few atoms show unique properties due to their novel atomic and electronic structure. Their discrete electronic states produce well-defined luminescence in clusters, such as Au 25, Au 23, Au 22, Au 8, etc. [1 – 7]. They have {{attracted the attention of}} various fields such as sensors, biolabels, live cell-targeted imaging [4], single molecule electroluminescence [8], opto-electronics [9], and catalysis [10]. In the case of Au 25, single crystal X-ray analysis has shown that it has an Au 13 core protected with six [Au(SR) 2] units in a core-shell-like pattern. The icosahedral Au 13 core has 20 triangular faces. However, only 12 facets are face-capped by the exterior 12 Au atoms which keep eight facets open [1]. These [...] "hole" [...] sites may be useful as active sites [11] which may participate in catalytic processes. Although the single crystal structures of the most of the clusters are yet to be solved, it is expected that many of them contain active sites. In this study, electron transfer properties of Ag 7 and Ag 8 clusters were explored using a simple reduction reaction, namely, the conversion of nitro to amino group, in different substrates. Catalysis using noble metals has caused great excitement after the initial report of Haruta [12]. It is known that reduction potential of silver nanoparticles change with size and shifts to more negative values with decrease in size, which are in good agreement with previous predictions [13]. QCs have very high negative reduction potential in comparison to bulk, and this makes them useful for the catalysis of electron transfer reactions. Silver is less expensive than other noble metals, and it was reported as an efficient catalyst for several reactions. For example, silver on alumina is a promising catalyst for selective catalytic reduction of NO by hydrocarbons from automobile exhausts [14]. It has been reported that Ag nanoparticles on hydroxyapatite in the presence of water catalyze the selective oxidation of various phenylsilanes into phenylsilanols [15] and also that the same system was found to be a highly efficient catalyst for the selective hydration of nitriles to amides [16]. It has been reported that chloroanilines were produced in large scale by the hydrogenation of chloronitrobenzenes using Ag nanoparticles on SiO 2, and the system also showed the size-dependent catalytic activity [17]. Formation of subsurface oxygen on the catalyst, enhanced in the case of supported silver clusters, {{plays an important role in}} CO oxidation [18]. Ag clusters supported on alumina are better active when compared to platinum supported on alumina for oxidant-free alcohol dehydrogenation to carbonyl compounds, and clusters less than 1 nm show structure-sensitive reactions [19]. It is reported that alumina is the best support for Ag, and it shows better selectivity for oxidation of ammonia to form nitrogen at low temperatures [20]. Silver nanoclusters on TiO 2 enhance the reduction of bis (2 -dipyridyl) disulfide to 2 -mercaptopyridine in the presence of water [21]. It has been reported that the selectivity for hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was very high in the presence of Ag catalyst below 3 -nm diameter; the catalyst was also structure sensitive [22]. Shimizu et al. [23] reported that <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> on alumina catalyze the cross-coupling reactions of alcohols, direct amide synthesis from alcohols and amines [24], and chemoselective reduction of a nitrostyrene with size-dependent catalytic activity [25]. The highest yield was obtained with particles of size ranging from 0.9 to 30 nm for the N-alkylation of anilines with benzyl alcohol for which silver shows high selectivity compared to other catalysts due to less stable metal-hydride bond formation [26]. Several reports are available for the reduction of nitro groups using nanoparticles [27 – 32]. Pal et al. reported the reduction of 4 -nitrophenol (4 -np) using silver nanoshells stabilized with cationic polystyrene beads [27] as well as silver deposited on silica gel [28]. It was reported that gold nanoparticles containing membranes reduce aromatic nitro compounds [29].

It is possible to produce coinage metal clusters dispersed in media such as in organic scaffold, liquid media, or embedded at the surface of some oxide glasses, in oxyfluoride or cavity of zeolites. Recently such dispersed {{clusters of}} coinage metals were prepared including the bimetallic clusters of copper and gold in gas phase in Ar matrix, silver clusters embedded in a oxyfluoride glass and silver clusters encapsulated inside the sodalite cavity of LTA-type zeolite. The optical spectra of some of these clusters have also been experimentally recorded. In this context, we performed quantum chemical calculations to model the experiments in order to obtain a deeper understanding of their photochemical properties. The modeling of the optical properties of coinage clusters was carried out using both the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) method and the multi-configurational complete active space perturbation theory (CASSCF/CASPT 2), that are described in Chapter 2. As for a simple calibration of the theoretical approaches employed, we applied both methods to a few small pure silver clustersAgn whose experimental absorption spectra were available. We started our simulations of the absorption spectra considering the rather small binary clusters of gold and copper metals in gas phase and in Ar matrix, for which the results are presented in Chapter 3. The size selected Cu and Au clusters embedded in Ar inert gas and their optical absorption spectra wereobtained. Such a matrix prevents the clusters from effectively dissociating upon irradiation. Clusters in the gas phase at a fixed size can have different structural arrangements, known as isomers, which may have nearly the same energy. Therefore, at given experimental conditions, a statistic distribution of these isomers can be present. The experimentally observed absorption spectra are expected to be the convolutions of spectra of different isomers. We theoretically identified several lower-lying isomers for each of the small gold-copper binary cation clusters in Ar matrix and determined their absorption spectra and compared them with experiment in order to assign the geometrical motifs of the most stable structures and the electronic structures of theclusters observed. The presence of a dopant is known to affect significantly the optical properties of the host cluster. The near-UV and visible light photodisociation spectra of the mixed Cu - Au tetramerswere investigated in detail both theoretically and experimentally, the latter being obtained by group of professor Peter Lievens, Physics Department, KULeuven. The questions of how the Cu dopant and Ar tagging influence the electronic structure and opticalabsorption spectra of the clusters have now been answered. The observed electronic transitions are markedly blue-shifted with increasing copper content even though the overall electronic structures of theclusters show similar features. The origin of observed bands was assigned to arise from AO(d) to AO(s) and from AO(s) to AO(s) of copper and gold electron transitions. We then performed a modeling for absorption and emission spectra of more complicated cluster-containing systems. That concerns the silver clusters embedded in an oxyfluoride glass. The results of our modeling are described in Chapter 4. The oxyflouride glass is a platform to disperse silver clusters in its whole glass bulk and prevent them from further agglomeration and against oxidation resulting in the extremely small sizes of silver clusters,which represents a novel type of optical property. The corresponding excitation spectra of luminescence were recorded experimentally by the group of professor Victor Moshchalkov, Physics Department, KU Leuven. It is especially difficult in this glass host to evaluate the actual number of Ag atoms includedin the clusters, due to limitations of available experimental techniques, and as far as we are aware, relatively little is known from the literature about interpretation and modeling of the optical spectra of Ag nanoclusters embedded in a solid host consisting of only a few Ag atoms. Therefore, our aim inthis work was twofold. First, we performed TD-DFT and CASPT 2 calculations to model the absorption spectra of silver clusters dispersed in the oxyfluoride aiming at assigning the size, charge and spin states of the luminescent Ag clusters. We concluded that the diamagnetic doubly charged tetramers contribute mostly to the excitation processes, and consequently to the emission spectra of luminescence of Ag clusters in this oxyfluoride glass. Second, in order to draw an effective mechanism for luminescence of dispersed Ag clusters, we established the energy level configuration coordinate diagram for the silver doubly charged tetramersembedded in the oxyfluoride glass. This diagram involving the overlapping singlet and triplet excited states allows us to interpret the observed luminescence of Ag clusters, which was undertaken from nanosecond to microsecond ranges, and distributed over a broad range of emission wavelengths. We subsequently performed quantum chemical calculations to model the optical behavior of silver clusters encapsulated inside the sodalite cavity of LTA-type zeolite. The results of this investigation are reported in Chapter 5. It is known that sometimes the silver cations and silver atoms aggregate to form charged, even highly charged, silver clusters encapsulated inside the sodalite cavity of zeolites, because they can be stabilized by interactions with negatively charged site of zeolites. The energy gaps between the ground and excited electronic states and the optical behavior were shown to be effectively changed with respect to the sizes and charges of the embedded silver clusters. The latterparameters depend on the level of ion exchange and level of reduction/heat treatment or irradiation. While high silver-exchange level results in zeolite containing a larger number of silver ions, high level of reduction results in lesser charged silver clusters. At certain levels of silver-exchange and of reduction, we may have noble gas-like silver clusters encapsulated inside the zeolite cavity. In this context we investigated theoretically the optical properties of some noble gas-like silver clusters encapsulated inside the sodalite cavity of LTA-type zeolite aiming at revealing the role of environment and the results could help us with the designing improved luminescent materials. We thus proposed that the tetradeca silver hexacation and octamer silver neutral can be formed inside the sodalite cavity of LTA-type zeolite, and the former is stabilized by electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged cavity. The electronic configurations of ground electronic state of these silver clusters mimic the electron configuration in the outer shell of noble gas atoms. We also modeled the absorption and emission spectra of these silver clusters. The modeling allow us to conclude that both the tetradeca silver hexacation and octamer silver neutral clusters absorb light intensively in the violet region and emit light in red color. In Chapter 5, we also considered the role of surrounding water molecules on the optical spectra of the embedded Ag clusters. We thus carried out quantum chemical calculations to model the absorption and emission behaviors of some hydrated charged silver clusters containing a few silver atoms. It is known that for zeolites containing silver clusters, high temperature and vacuum treatment leads to the loss of water molecules resulting in zeolite color change. Further heating or illumination of the dehydrated zeolite induces an auto-reduction of silver, and formation of either charged or neutral silver clusters was proposed. The hydrated doubly charged tetramer and hydrated charged hexamer silver clusters encapsulated inside the sodalite cavity of LTA-type zeolite were chosen for our theoretical simulations since they are widely synthesized and their absorption and emission behaviours were recorded experimentally. Theoretical simulations of the optical properties of hydrated charged silver tetramer and hexamer clusters were performed in order to assist in identifying the spectroscopic signatures as well as revealing the role of water environment on the light absorption and emission. Theoretical investigations weredone systematically using DFT and TD-DFT methods, along with CASSCF/CASPT 2 computations. Our modeling showed that the optical behaviors of the embedded hydrated charged silver clusters change very much with respect to the cluster charge, but change little with respect to the numbers of surrounding water molecules. The quadruply charged hexamer exhibits an intensive blue light absorption band and it emits light in red color. The embedded hydrated doubly charged tetramer silver cluster also intensively absorbs blue light but emits the green-yellow light. The ligand field formed by surrounding water molecules tends to split the excited states of the silver clusters, and as the results, the absorption spectra are broadened and the emission shifted to a visible region of much longer wavelengths. In summary, in this doctoral study we endeavored to provide the elements of answers to, andinterpretations of, the numerous questions posed and the observations derived from experimental electro-optical behaviors of the clusters of coinage metals, in particular of silver, dispersed in some inorganic environments. Concerning the methodology, our results tend to confirm the usefulness of time-dependent densityfunctional theory (TD-DFT) in the reliable simulation of absorption spectra of Ag-containing clusters. This method, along with a popular functional such as the hybrid B 3 LYP functional, can be used when the more accurate but more demanding CASPT 2 /CASSCF computations could not be performed, due to the limits of computational resources. Another important point concerns the selection and optimization of appropriate models used in the simulations. Much work however needs to be carried out in future studies on these exciting materials. For the silver tetamer doubly charged embedded in the oxyfluoride, the glassy solid environment of theoptical center is rather flexible. The optical spectra recorded at room temperature have the homogeneous broadening shape while the ones at lower temperature may not be due to the limitation of the thermal population of vibrational states. Therefore, the temperature dependence of luminescence of Ag nanoclusters is also an interesting and challenging case for both theoretical and experimental studies alike. For the silver clusters encapsulated inside the environments of water and zeolite, it is of significantinterest to theoretically investigate the geometrical and electronic structures of both dry and hydrated silver cluster in comparison with the experimental EXAFS and experimental absorption/emission data in order to assign precisely the structures of the clusters generated and their optical signatures.
