Lois refuses {{to sign a}}nd takes Stewie to visit her parents. Before Brian can present the petition to the mayor, Chris burns it because Alyssa has agreed he may touch her breasts if he destroys the document, much to Brian's anger. Brian manages to get 10,000 more signatures on a new petition {{to show it to}} Mayor West, but West still won't <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> Out of desperation, Brian takes a security guard’s gun, and holds the mayor hostage.|$|E
5|$|In Harry Patch's book The Last Fighting Tommy, {{the author}} claims that Allingham planned {{to leave his}} body to medical science. In his own book, Kitchener's Last Volunteer, Allingham {{confirmed}} that he was intending to leave his body to medical science. However he was persuaded by Denis Goodwin to <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> as he {{became a symbol of}} World War I to remind people of the sacrifices made during the conflict. To that end he agreed to a funeral and cremation.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Jon and Sansa {{are only}} able to recruit {{a small number of}} minor houses, only adding a few hundred extra {{soldiers}} to their army. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Jon is adamant that they attack Winterfell as soon as possible before the Boltons rally more forces and before the weather turns on them. Sansa disagrees, insisting that they try and recruit more houses. When Jon refuses to <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> Sansa begins writing a letter to be sent by raven.|$|E

5|$|The US {{government}} {{was aware of}} these activities in Cambodia, but refrained from taking overt military action within Cambodia in hopes of convincing the mercurial Sihanouk to alter his position. To accomplish this, President Lyndon B. Johnson authorized covert cross-border reconnaissance operations conducted by the secret Studies and Observations Group in order to gather intelligence on PAVN/NLF activities in the border regions (Project Vesuvius). This intelligence data would then {{be presented to the}} prince in an effort to <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bart {{explains}} that he knew Homer would probably <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> and decided to send the letter before that could happen. Homer desperately tries to prevent the letter from reaching Mr. Burns, but fails. Mr. Burns becomes furious and demands that Homer be beaten. However, Smithers calls off the beating {{on the grounds that}} is no way to thank the man who saved Mr. Burns' life, and instead convinces Mr. Burns to instead reward the Simpson family. The Simpsons receive an antique Xtapolapocetl, an Olmec head (a massive, Tiki-god-like affair) that Bart, the blood donor, likes, and which Homer hates.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{stressed}} {{that he would}} act as the trustee of the princes' commitment, as he would be serving as India's head of state well into 1948. He engaged in a personal dialogue with reluctant princes, such as the Nawab of Bhopal, who he asked through a confidential letter to sign the Instrument of Accession making Bhopal part of India, which Mountbatten would keep locked up in his safe. It would be handed to the States Department on 15 August only if the Nawab did not <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> before then, which {{he was free to}} do. The Nawab agreed, and did not renege over the deal.|$|E

5|$|The success {{achieved}} by Operation Badr surprised Egyptian commanders, whose confidence soared. Sadat came {{under pressure to}} press the offensive towards the Sinai Passes, but remained unyielding, holding to the original goal of waging a limited war. Ahmed Ismail and Shazly were also on par with Sadat's opinion. However, appeals from the Syrians, whose situation was desperate by October 9, ultimately forced Sadat to <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> for political reasons, against the protests of his commanders. Consequently, Egypt would lose the initiative to Israel when it launched its unsuccessful attack eastwards on October 14.|$|E
5|$|Totti {{intended}} {{to retire from}} international football after the 2006 World Cup, but reneged on his decision and remained undecided on his future for over a year, not being called up in the meantime. He made his retirement official on 20 July 2007, {{at the beginning of}} the 2007–08 Serie A season, due to recurring physical problems and in order to focus solely on club play with Roma. Italy's coach at the time, Roberto Donadoni, attempted to get Totti to <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> for the remaining Euro 2008 qualifiers but was not successful.|$|E

Gopalam and Ammi misunderstand, thinking that Mary is pregnant; they host a party, and Mary is confused. The night before she is due to leave, Rao pretends his leg is broken in an attempt to delay her departure. David arrives in the morning and tells Raju that Mary, a Christian, is posing as a Hindu for the job.

5|$|Brian Bloom (Anton Yelchin), a {{struggling}} 24-year-old writer in New York City, meets a 33-year-old French woman named Arielle Pierpoint (Bérénice Marlohe). They feel powerfully attracted to one another. After their second meeting, Arielle reveals {{that she is}} married to a diplomat, Valéry (Lambert Wilson), and they have two young children. Arielle and Valéry have an agreement that each is permitted to have extramarital affairs {{as long as they are}} limited to the time between 5 and 7 p.m. on weeknights. Brian is perplexed at this information and tells Arielle that he cannot continue the relationship with her, believing it is an unethical affair. Arielle says that, should he <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> she will continue to smoke on Fridays at the same place they met.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's father, Tom Miller (Ken Pogue), tells Black {{about two}} {{friends of his}} whose son was convicted of killing his wife. The father, C. R. Hunziger, is dying of {{pancreatic}} cancer, but maintains his distance from his son over the crime; his wife Adele, however, still believes her son to be innocent. Black visits the terminal Hunziger, hoping to <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> but the elderly man holds his position. Adele gives Black a folder full of documents relating to the case, which Black reviews. His knowledge of offender profiling leads him {{to believe that the}} convicted man, Malcom, is innocent; however the conviction was secured with a substantial level of physical evidence.|$|E
5|$|In 1631 Wiśniowiecki {{returned}} to the Commonwealth and took over from his uncle the management of his father's huge estate, which included {{a large part of}} what is now Ukraine. In 1632 he converted from Eastern Orthodoxy to Catholicism, an action that caused much concern in Ukraine. His decision has been analyzed by historians, and often criticized, particularly in Ukrainian historiography. The Orthodox Church feared to lose a powerful protector, and Isaiah Kopinsky, metropolitan bishop of Kiev and a friend of his mother, unsuccessfully pleaded with him to <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> Jeremi would not budge although he remained on decent terms with the Orthodox Church, avoiding provocative actions, and supported his uncle and Orthodox bishop Peter Mogila and his Orthodox Church collegium.|$|E

5|$|In January Manstein {{was forced}} to retreat further west by the Soviet offensive. Without waiting for {{permission}} from Hitler, he ordered the German XI and XXXXII Corps (consisting of 56,000 men in six divisions) of Army Group South {{to break out of}} the Korsun Pocket during the night of 16–17 February 1944. By the beginning of March, the Soviet forces had driven the Wehrmacht well back of the river. Because of Hitler's directive of 19 March that from that point forward all positions were to be defended to the last man, Manstein's 1st Panzer Army became encircled on 21 March when permission to break out was not received from Hitler in time. Manstein flew to Hitler's headquarters in Lvov to try to convince him to <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> Hitler eventually relented, but relieved Manstein of his command on 30 March 1944.|$|E
5|$|John was incensed {{about what}} he {{perceived}} as an abrogation of his customary right as monarch to influence the election. He complained both about the choice of Langton as an individual, as John felt he was overly influenced by the Capetian court in Paris, and about the process as a whole. He barred Langton from entering England and seized the lands of the archbishopric and other papal possessions. Innocent set a commission in place {{to try to convince}} John to <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> but to no avail. Innocent then placed an interdict on England in March 1208, prohibiting clergy from conducting religious services, with the exception of baptisms for the young, and confessions and absolutions for the dying.|$|E
5|$|To Whistler himself, {{however, the}} {{painting}} was not old-fashioned, but rather an expression of something new and innovative. By naming it Symphony in White, No. 3, Whistler highlighted his emphasis on composition, rather than subject matter. The use of a musical title was also {{an expression of the}} theory of corresponding arts, which was an idea developed by the French poet Charles Baudelaire. These tendencies became more and more dominant in Whistler's art over time. His two earlier paintings Symphony in White, No. 1 and Symphony in White, No. 2 had originally been titled The White Girl and The Little White Girl respectively, and later been renamed by the artist. Whistler had originally intended to call this work Two Little White Girls, but the development of his artistic philosophy made him <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> and from the time of its first exhibition it has been called by its musical title.|$|E

5|$|When he was fifteen, Vainio {{felt sure}} he would become a writer. As a young man he read a book about poetics, and later said that the rules were easy to break once he had learned them. It became {{apparent}} in essays written whilst at the gymnasium that Juha had talent as a writer. However, teachers sometimes had mixed feelings about his writing; at one time he received no grade for a lighthearted column-like text he had written, because the teacher felt {{that it could not}} be graded as an essay. Although essays were his strong point, school was uninteresting for Juha. He considered quitting school, but the principal persuaded him to <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> He was transferred to another school and was later joined there by his friend Risto Warjus. In the end, the only school subjects in which Vainio excelled were singing and sports.|$|E
5|$|Winchelsey was a fearless {{opponent}} of Edward I. When he swore his oath of fealty to Edward, he offended the king {{by adding a}} declaration {{that he was only}} swearing fealty for the temporalities, not the spiritualities. All through his term as archbishop he refused to allow Edward to tax the clergy beyond certain levels, and withstood severe pressure to <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> In August 1295, he offered the king a tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues, less than Edward had hoped to collect from the clergy. Winchelsey did concede though that if the war with France, which was what the money was requested to fund, continued into the following year, then the clergy would be amenable to making further contributions.|$|E
5|$|Available {{evidence}} indicates that the real Lad was born in December 1902, and that unlike his fictional counterpart, Lad was a collie of unknown lineage with no American Kennel Club registration papers. After living five years with a heart tumor, the dog died on September 3, 1918 and his obituary was featured on a multi-page spread of the September 14, 1918 issue of Field and Fancy magazine. Terhune reported that he received hundreds of letters from fans asking him to publish more stories about Lad, and that over 1,700 people visit Lad's grave at Sunnybank. In 1922, he collected together eleven more short stories into a novel; the stories were published earlier in The Ladies' Home Journal, with some new stories and some from other magazines. The new set of stories primarily revolved around the themes of right and wrong, abuse of authority, and justice. Intending {{it to be the}} last book he would write about his late collie, Terhune killed the fictional Lad in the last chapter of the novel. The novel was published by George H. Doran as Further Adventures of Lad. Seven years and twenty other novels later, he would <b>change</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> and release one more Lad novel, Lad of Sunnybank, which was published by HarperCollins.|$|E
