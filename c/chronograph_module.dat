50|$|The <b>chronograph</b> <b>module</b> was {{controlled}} by three round pushers {{on the left side}} of the case and the analogue time and date was adjusted by a crown which could be pulled out to adjust the hour and date and a button within the crown which when pressed advanced the minutes.|$|E
50|$|The calibre 930 was {{relatively}} short lived {{and was not}} originally popular. At the time of introduction quartz watch technology such as the Omega Electroquartz was taking off and there was already a significantly established line of Omega chronographs which was complimented in the early 1970s by a range of automatic Omega Chronographs under calibre 1040, 1041 (the world's first chronometer chronograph used in the Omega Speedmaster 125) and 1045 {{as well as a}} range of electronic chronographs branded as Speedsonic and using a tuning fork movement with additional <b>chronograph</b> <b>module.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the watch was very {{distinctive}} - primarily it was large (51mm wide including the pushers), even in comparison to other watches of the day, constructed in stainless steel and with an integral solid link stainless steel bracelet. The watch has a significant wrist presence. The main reason for the big dimensions {{was the size of}} the movement, which had to accommodate the analogue module (on the right) and the digital <b>chronograph</b> <b>module</b> (on the left). The case back bore the Omega Seamaster hippocampus as well as the Olympic crest in recognition of the event at which it was released.|$|E
