40|$|<b>Carve</b> <b>out</b> {{projects}} have recently become an emerging issue {{in practice and}} theory given the diversity of strategic foci of companies as well as recent merger and acquisition activities. This paper highlights the relevance of IT in such <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> projects. IT depicts their characteristics and specific features with regard to general IT projects as well as success factors {{for the management of}} IT <b>carve</b> <b>outs.</b> Based on a systematic literature review, we conducted 18 exploratory expert interviews with different stakeholders involved in the management of IT <b>carve</b> <b>outs.</b> We show that the perception and acknowledgement of the IT function within the overall <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> project is broadly underestimated. We elaborate on learnings for the successful management of the IT function within a <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> project: the involvement of IT executives in the early phases of contract negotiations; improved IT due diligence processes for a better anticipation of IT costs; early analysis of the target enterprise architecture. Additionally, we identified success factors of managing IT <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> projects. This paper is among the first to shed light into the research field of IT <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> projects including exploratory empirical data and gives recommendations for future research of IT <b>carve</b> <b>outs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Equity <b>carve</b> <b>outs,</b> {{the partial}} listing of a {{corporate}} subsidiary, appear to be transitory arrangements, usually dissolved {{within a few years}} by either a complete sale or a buy back. Why do firms perform expensive listings just to reverse them thereafter? We interpret <b>carve</b> <b>outs</b> as strategic options to attract information from the market over the relative value of a productive unit as an independent entity and thus to improve the decision process on whether to sell out or to retain control. The separate listing is costly, as it reduces coordination of production, but generates valuable information from the market over the optimal allocation of ownership. We compute the optimal timing for the final sale or buy back decisions, the value of the strategic options embedded in the <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> and the optimal shares retained. The model explains the temporary nature of <b>carve</b> <b>outs,</b> and suggests an explanation for many empirical findings. In particular, it explains why <b>carve</b> <b>outs</b> are more common in sectors with high uncertainty and in more informative markets.

The Snake River Plain {{was created by}} a volcanic hotspot which now lies underneath Yellowstone National Park, where {{the headwaters of the}} Snake River arise.

In the northeast the isle shelves to a shore, but otherwise the coast is rugged and much indented; numerous caves have been <b>carved</b> <b>out</b> by rain, streams and sea. There is enough grass to feed a few cattle, and the island has a spring.|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{construction}} has several stages, including making and shaping of the drum body (or shell), preparing the drum skin, and tuning {{the skin to}} the drumhead. Variations in the construction process often occur in the latter two parts of this process. Historically, byō-uchi-daiko were crafted from trunks of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent splitting. A master carpenter then <b>carved</b> <b>out</b> the rough shape of the drum body with a chisel; {{the texture of the}} wood after carving softened the tone of the drum. In contemporary times, taiko are <b>carved</b> <b>out</b> on a large lathe using wood staves or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes. Drumheads can be left to air-dry over a period of years, but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the drying process. After drying is complete, the inside of the drum is worked with a deep-grooved chisel and sanded. Lastly, handles are placed onto the drum. These are used to carry smaller drums and they serve an ornamental purpose for larger drums.|$|E

However, in the late 15th century the Kaqchikel rebelled against their former K'iche' allies and founded a new kingdom to the southeast with Iximche as its capital. In the decades before the Spanish invasion the Kaqchikel kingdom had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the K'iche'. Other highland groups included the Tz'utujil around Lake Atitlán, the Mam in the western highlands and the Poqomam in the eastern highlands.|$|E
