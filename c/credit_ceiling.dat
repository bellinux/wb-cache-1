50|$|As the {{probability}} of default is higher when debt is higher, there exists a level of lending that maximises expected return to the lender, and so the <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling</b> will depend on {{the probability}} of default. If desired lending is higher than the <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling,</b> some countries will not receive funds, and credit rationing will occur. This setting is reminiscent of Stiglitz and Weiss, as the interest rate has an incentive effect, and does not play the standard allocational role prices are supposed to play. As in that case, the allocation mechanism in Eaton and Gersovitz is credit rationing, which is not related to interest rate (the price of credit); at the going rate, countries want to borrow more but credit is denied.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine whether}} credit {{contributes}} to business cycle fluctuations by directly affecting consumption {{rather than through}} the now well-understood investment channel. Examining UK data we argue that consumers face a rising interest rate schedule whereby additional borrowing leads to higher interest rates. At {{a certain level of}} debt this schedule may become vertical and consumers face a <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Using this assumption we find consumption growth depends on the interest rate, the borrowing wedge, and the debt-income ratio, and that we can potentially account for the failings of the rational expectations permanent income hypothesis (REPIH). Risk aversion and the interest rate schedule interact such that agents choose not to hold much debt, however, and so consumers are not much affected by ‘credit crunches’, although the more efficient the capital market, the bigger the impact. Calibrating our model and performing simulations suggests the sharp increases in UK consumption in the late 1980 s were more likely due to income revisions than financial deregulation per se.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} investment policies in regimes undergoing trade liberalization with policy makers of uncertain credibility. We consider an economy producing exportable and importable goods. The economy is liberalized, and tariffs are eliminated. The public views the reform credibility as questionable, and expects the possibility of future policy reversal. The policy maker sets policies and public investment as to maximize the expected utility of a risk averse representative agent. We identify the need to tax private investment in the importable sector, and to subsidize private investment in the outward-oriented sector. We show that the signaling effect of public investment nay generate a positive externality for public investment in the outward sector, and a negative externality for public investment in the inward-oriented activity. We demonstrate that the elimination of sectorial private investment policies call for {{a rise in the}} public/private capital ratio in the outward-oriented activities, and a drop in that ratio in the inward-oriented activities. In the presence of an external <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling,</b> a higher degree of risk aversion increases the magnitude (without changing the nature) of the policies. ...|$|E
40|$|Private {{investors have}} an {{important}} role toplay in the ongoing process of reform in Eastern Europe. So external creditworthiness is crucial to a successful transition. Large government borrowing crowds out the formation of private contracts between international investors and domestic entrepreneurs and firms. Given the overall <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling</b> in international lending, the public sector needs to curtail its external borrowing to leave room for the private sector. This also implies that public debt reduction may be especially desirable in the highly indebted countries of Eastern Europe. Rather than flood the public sector with new loans, international organizations should attempt to improve domestic creditworthiness by supporting debt reduction and borrowing restraints during the transition period. Debt for equity swaps represent an attractive vehicle for debt reduction in the highly indebted countries of Eastern Europe. Such schemes, when tied to the privatization effort, are not inflationary. They simply represent a swap of public liabilities, and they create value to the extent that foreign private investment leads to positive externalities. The challenge will be to create swap mechanisms that will allow the Eastern European countries to retain a large share of those gains.

There is no discernible growth effect of financial repression in the sample studied here. <b>Credit</b> <b>ceilings</b> do not reduce the volatility or the level of nominal interest rates but they succeed in lowering the average real interest rate level.

40|$|This paper models {{a dynamic}} {{bargaining}} game between a highly indebted {{country and its}} commercial bank consortium, to analyze the determinants of the resulting re-scheduling agreements and the net transfer of resources over time. The bargaining game {{is based on the}} simple paradigm that if no agreement is reached for a current payment, the banks would apply default sanctions. The author found that under general conditions settlements would be reached and default sanctions would not be applied in equilibrium. But the default sanctions would be a credible threat underlying the negotiations and determining the equilibrium payments. These equilibrium payments in turn would determine the <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling</b> and the later commercial discounts on the debt market. Unlike other bargaining games, this one explicitly models the debtor country's economic structure, featuring an import-dependent economy subject to foreign exchange and fiscal constraints.

40|$|Previous {{approaches}} to credit {{policy in the}} stabilization and adjustment of developing countries have emphasized either {{the role of the}} availability of credit or the role of its price - that is, the interest rate. The authors argue that effective credit policy in developing countries must take into account both interest rate and credit channels. The authors develop their argument {{in the context of the}} link between credit policy and private investment, using a model of firms'investment behavior in an economy with exogenous, time-varying borrowing constraints. The model incorporates a <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling</b> linked to the firms'net worth and the state of the credit market. The state of the credit market depends on factors such as credit and interest rate policy, regulatory and supervisory practices, and market sentiments that banks consider in making lending decisions. These factors affect banks'decisions independent of a borrower's creditworthiness. Thus, in times of tight money, firms that would otherwise have received loans may be denied them and have to postpone or cut back investment plans. The authors use their model to specify an equation relating aggregate private investment to aggregate output and to two credit market variables. Their findings show that interest rates and credit volume exert a joint influence on the behavior of private investment in the countries examined.

40|$|As {{economic}} reforms are mutually interdependent, a liberal policy package needs internal coherence. How can a coherent reform strategy be achieved for a well-balanced and functional economic system? In this paper, we analyze {{the relationship between}} financial reforms coherence and international capital inflows (foreign direct investments (FDI) and portfolio investments). We consider a package of eight financial reforms, comprising interest rate deregulation, <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling</b> and directed-credit programs liberalization, elimination of banking sector entry barriers, privatization of state owed banks, development of security markets and banking sector supervision measures. Complementarity is measured through the reciprocal of the Herfindahl-Hirschman concentration index. The {{results suggest that the}} manner with which financial reforms are implemented matters. Particularly, complementarity increases FDI inflows by 0. 10 %. Moreover, this effect depends on the location of the countries on the distribution of financial reforms level. Indeed, the countries located above the median value of financial reform level experience larger FDI and portfolio investment inflows than others. Finally, when privatization of state owned banks and the adoption of a capital adequacy ratio based on the Basle I standard occur after other preliminary financial reforms, the returns to complementarity are higher. In others words, a developed and relatively safe domestic financial system attracts more FDI and portfolio investments than a developed but unsafe financial system. [...] ...|$|E

The paper sets out an analytical framework, based on a particular formalization of the government intertemporal budget constraint, which justifies the measures of seigniorage and implicit taxation that are computed for the period 1980 - 1990. The results show that this source of revenue is very significant: its average value for the 1980 s is 1. 71 % of GDP for Spain and 3. 98 % of GDP for Portugal.

30|$|Contemporary finance {{researchers}} have extensively investigated {{the link between}} financial liberalization and other macroeconomics variables, but the role of financial development is not universally accepted. One of the oldest findings {{on the relationship between}} financial development and economic growth is based on Schumpeter (1912) who asserts that, the services provided by the financial intermediaries are important for innovation and development. According to Bagehot (1873) and Hicks (1969), development in the financial system {{played a critical role in}} industrialising England through the facilitation of capital mobilisation. Schumpeter (1912) harnesses the importance of the banking system in economic growth; financial institutions support innovation and creativity and thus enhance future growth by identifying and funding productive investments. Therefore, it facilitates the creation of wealth, trade and the formation of capital (Ahmed 2006). A further step taken by Fry (1978, 1980) and Galbis (1977) suggested that, interventions to impose restrictions on the banking system such as <b>credit</b> <b>ceilings</b> and high reserve requirements have a negative impact on the development of the financial sector, which ultimately reduces economic growth. In addition, (Levine 1997) suggested that aiding risk management, improving liquidity and reducing transaction costs leads to financial system development and thus encourages investments.|$|R
