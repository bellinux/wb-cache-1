5|$|Wild equines {{may spend}} seven {{hours a day}} sleeping. During the day, they sleep {{standing}} up while at night they lie down. They regularly rub against trees, rocks and other objects and roll in around in dust for protection against flies and irritation. Except the mountain zebra, wild equines <b>can</b> <b>roll</b> over completely.|$|E
5|$|Many species <b>can</b> <b>roll</b> {{themselves}} into a ball, a behaviour used in defence that also conserves moisture. Members of the families Ligiidae and Tylidae, commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the woodlice for life on land. They inhabit the splash zone on rocky shores, jetties and pilings, may hide under debris washed up on the shore and can swim if immersed in water.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{previous}} {{titles in the}} Prime series, Metroid Prime Hunters is generally classified as a first-person adventure to highlight the focus on navigation and discovery. However, the game differs from its predecessors with the removal of assisted aiming, more action-oriented gameplay, and the inclusion of an online multiplayer mode. The player controls Samus Aran, who {{is equipped with a}} Power Suit that allows her to access her gunship from anywhere. She can scan almost any object in the game; the gunship will return relevant information retrieved from its database. An Arm Cannon is attached to the Power Suit, which she uses to attack enemies. To enter small tunnels, Samus <b>can</b> <b>roll</b> into a Morph Ball, an alternative form of the Power Suit that decreases her size substantially. In this form, she is given an unlimited supply of bombs but is only allowed to use three at a time. She can use the bombs to defend herself and destroy small objects.|$|E

5|$|Link can {{transform}} at will into different creatures: the Deku Mask transforms Link into a Deku Scrub, the Goron Mask into a Goron, and the Zora Mask into a Zora. Each form features unique abilities: Deku Link can perform a spin attack, shoot bubbles from his mouth, skip on water, and fly {{for a short}} time by launching from Deku Flowers; Goron Link <b>can</b> <b>roll</b> at high speeds (and grow spikes at higher speeds), punch with deadly force, stomp the ground with his massive, rock-like body, walk in lava without taking damage, and weigh down heavy switches; Zora Link can swim rapidly, throw boomerang-like fins from his arms, generate a force field, and walk on the bottoms of bodies of water. Many areas can be accessed only by use of these abilities.|$|E
5|$|The regular {{gameplay}} {{features a}} third-person perspective, where players hold the Wii Remote horizontally. Samus can jump, fire the arm cannon, and {{turn into a}} morph ball, which <b>can</b> <b>roll</b> into narrow passages and drop energy bombs. While gameplay is similar to early Metroid titles, the game's environments are three-dimensional and movement {{is not limited to}} a two-dimensional plane. When the Wii Remote is pointed towards the screen, the angle switches into a first-person perspective, where players can lock onto targets and fire missiles; however, players cannot move in this perspective. There are several instances where players will have to constantly switch between play modes; for example, fighting off a horde of flying enemies in third person, while switching to first person to destroy their spawn points. Additionally, the first-person mode is also used in exploration, such as locating hidden items.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the amphipods, {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} isopods are entirely benthic. This gives them little chance to disperse to new regions and {{may explain why}} so many species are endemic to restricted ranges. Crawling is the primary means of locomotion, and some species bore into the seabed, the ground or timber structures. Some members of the Flabellifera can swim to a limited extent and have their front three pairs of pleopods modified for this purpose, with their respiratory structures limited to the hind pleopods. Most terrestrial species are slow-moving and conceal themselves under objects or hide in crevices or under bark. The semi-terrestrial sea slaters (Ligia spp.) can run rapidly on land and many terrestrial species <b>can</b> <b>roll</b> themselves into a ball when threatened, a feature that has evolved independently in different groups {{and also in the}} marine sphaeromatids.|$|E
60|$|Of course Danny {{had been}} terribly frightened when the <b>can</b> <b>rolled,</b> {{and by the}} noise the claws of Redtail made when they struck his queer hiding-place. But he wisely decided {{that the best thing}} he could do was to stay there for a while. And it was very {{fortunate}} that he did so, as he was very soon to find out.|$|R

25|$|Woodlice in {{the genus}} Armadillidium {{and in the}} family Armadillidae <b>can</b> <b>roll</b> up into an almost perfect sphere as a {{defensive}} mechanism, hence some of the common names such as pill bug, or roly-poly. Most woodlice, however, cannot do this.|$|E
25|$|Another roulette, {{formed by}} rolling {{a line on}} a catenary, is another line. This implies that square wheels <b>can</b> <b>roll</b> {{perfectly}} smoothly on a road made {{of a series of}} bumps in the shape of an inverted catenary curve. The wheels can be any regular polygon except a triangle, but the catenary must have parameters corresponding to the shape and dimensions of the wheels.|$|E
25|$|The {{other major}} {{factory in the}} city is Tata Motors with Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. Ltd, which {{manufactures}} heavy vehicles and construction/earth moving equipment. Tata Motors was previously called The Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (TELCO), as railway locomotives were once manufactured here. The plant spreads over 822 acres, {{is one of the}} largest in the country, and at peak rate <b>can</b> <b>roll</b> out 450 vehicles per day.|$|E

25|$|Cusped {{confinement}} was explored theoretically and experimentally. However, most cusped experiments {{failed and}} disappeared from national programs by 1980. Bussard later called {{this type of}} confinement the Wiffle-Ball. This analogy was used to describe electron trapping inside the field. Marbles can be trapped inside a Wiffle ball, a hollow, perforated sphere; if marbles are put inside, they <b>can</b> <b>roll</b> and sometimes escape through {{the holes in the}} sphere. The magnetic topology of a high-beta polywell acts similarly with electrons.|$|E
25|$|At {{first we}} used a {{character}} {{that looked like a}} rabbit with ears that could extend and pick up objects. As the game got faster and faster, we needed {{to come up with a}} special characteristic to give our character some power over his enemies. I remembered a character I had thought about years ago who could roll himself into a ball and slam into enemies. Hedgehogs <b>can</b> <b>roll</b> themselves into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E
25|$|Hasek roll: The Hasek roll is a desperation {{maneuver}} {{named after}} Czech goaltender Dominik Hašek. In the stacked pad stance {{the lower part}} of the net is protected very well, but the upper third is completely open. In a last-ditch effort to block an incoming high shot the goaltender <b>can</b> <b>roll</b> around his upper back, flailing his pads through the air and stacking them on the other side. If the timing is right the goalie might get his leg up just in time to make the save.|$|E

50|$|Puff-puffs {{are made}} of dough {{containing}} flour, yeast, sugar, butter, salt, water and eggs and deep fried in vegetable oil until a golden brown colour. Variations {{can be made in}} the recipe by using baking powder in place of yeast but yeast is more common. After frying, puff puffs <b>can</b> be <b>rolled</b> in sugar. Like the French beignet and the Italian zeppole, puff-puffs <b>can</b> be <b>rolled</b> in any spices/flavouring such as cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg and for a fusion style of cooking puff-puffs served with a fruit dip such as strawberry or raspberry. Puff puff can be taken with juice as lunch.|$|R
25|$|Other {{gameplay}} sections involve different control {{schemes and}} game mechanics. For example, when wearing the jet pack, Haven can accelerate upwards by expending fuel. When using the glider, {{as well as}} basic maneuverability, he can perform an air brake. In the biplane, he <b>can</b> <b>roll</b> left and right. In the speedboat and quadracer, he can accelerate and brake. When operating a turret or spaceship, he has access to forward and aft missiles and can lock on to enemies. The spaceship Sunsurfer, which Haven acquires {{towards the end of}} the game, also has access to different types of missiles, and can equip a shield.|$|E
25|$|Most dung beetles {{search for}} dung using their {{sensitive}} sense of smell. Some smaller species simply attach {{themselves to the}} dung-providers {{to wait for the}} dung. After capturing the dung, a dung beetle rolls it, following a straight line despite all obstacles. Sometimes, dung beetles try to steal the dung ball from another beetle, so the dung beetles have to move rapidly away from a dung pile once they have rolled their ball to prevent it from being stolen. Dung beetles <b>can</b> <b>roll</b> up to 10 times their weight. Male Onthophagus taurus beetles can pull 1,141 times their own body weight: the equivalent of an average person pulling six double-decker buses full of people.|$|E
25|$|All {{characters}} have {{a light and}} a heavy attack, and all three <b>can</b> <b>roll,</b> block and sprint. Players can also perform critical strikes; when a yellow indicator appears {{over the head of}} an enemy a heavy attack will produce a critical strike, which are extra-strong attacks that often kills the enemy with a single hit. During a single-player game, players may issue orders to their AI companions; ordering them to either seek out enemies and attack, or stay near the player character and defend. Players may also revive fallen allies; if the player character dies, the player must wait to be revived by an AI ally. Another aspect of combat is the player's ability to summon a Great Eagle to aid them. The eagle can target a single foe for a large amount of damage. However, the player is limited in the number of times they can summon him, and he can be summoned only when the player is in an outdoors location.|$|E

50|$|Simple press <b>rolls</b> <b>can</b> be <b>rolls</b> with grooved or blind drilled surface. More {{advanced}} press rolls are suction rolls. These are rolls with perforated {{shell and}} cover. The shell made of metal material such as bronze stainless steel {{is covered with}} rubber or a synthetic material. Both shell and cover are drilled throughout the surface. A stationary suction box is fitted {{in the core of}} the suction roll to support the shell being pressed. End face mechanical seals are used for the interface between the inside surface of the shell and the suction box. For the smooth rolls, they are typically made of granite rolls. The granite <b>rolls</b> <b>can</b> be up to 30 ft long and 6 ft in diameter.|$|R
