5|$|Adding a {{multiple}} of any row to another row, or {{a multiple}} of any column to another <b>column,</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> change the determinant. Interchanging two rows or two columns affects the determinant by multiplying it by −1. Using these operations, any matrix can be transformed to a lower (or upper) triangular matrix, and for such matrices the determinant equals {{the product of the}} entries on the main diagonal; this provides a method to calculate the determinant of any matrix. Finally, the Laplace expansion expresses the determinant in terms of minors, that is, determinants of smaller matrices. This expansion can be used for a recursive definition of determinants (taking as starting case the determinant of a 1-by-1 matrix, which is its unique entry, or even the determinant of a 0-by-0 matrix, which is 1), that can be seen to be equivalent to the Leibniz formula. Determinants can be used to solve linear systems using Cramer's rule, where the division of the determinants of two related square matrices equates to the value of each of the system's variables.|$|E
25|$|Adding a scalar {{multiple}} of one column to another <b>column</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> change {{the value of}} the determinant. This is a consequence of properties 8 and 10 in the following way: by property8 the determinant changes by a {{multiple of}} the determinant of a matrix with two equal columns, which determinant is 0 by property10. Similarly, adding a scalar multiple of one row to another row leaves the determinant unchanged.|$|E

[8] [This [...] "...is {{not exactly}} so; the third <b>column</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> {{seem to have}} ever had a ring, but the traces of these rings are very visible in the two first columns from the entrance, {{although}} the rings have been removed; and on the three last we find the rings still riveted on the darkest side of the pillars where they face the rock, so that the unfortunate prisoners chained there were even bereft of light.... The fifth column {{is said to be}} the one to which Bonivard was chained during four years. Byron's name is carved on the southern side of the third column ... on the seventh tympanum, at about 1 metre 45 from the lower edge of the shaft." [...] Much has been written for and against the authenticity of this inscription, which, according to M. Naef, the author of Guide, was carved by Byron himself, [...] "with an antique ivory-mounted stiletto, which had been discovered in the duke's room."--Guide, etc., pp. 39-42. The inscription was in situ as early as August 22, 1820, as Mr. Richard Edgcumbe points out (Notes and Queries, Series V. xi. 487).] ...|$|E

6000|$|But {{how does}} the flame get hold of the fuel? There is a {{beautiful}} point about that--capillary attraction[4]. [...] "Capillary attraction!" [...] you say,--"the attraction of hairs." [...] Well, never mind the name: it was given in old times, before {{we had a good}} understanding of what the real power was. It is by what is called capillary attraction that the fuel is conveyed to the part where combustion goes on, and is deposited there, not in a careless way, but very beautifully in the very midst of the centre of action which takes place around it. Now, I am going to give you one or two instances of capillary attraction. It is that kind of action or attraction which makes two things that do not dissolve in each other still hold together. When you wash your hands, you wet them thoroughly; you take a little soap to make the adhesion better, and you find your hand remains wet. This is by that kind of attraction of which I am about to speak. And, what is more, if your hands are not soiled (as they almost always are by the usages of life), if you put your finger into a little warm water, the water will creep a little way up the finger, though you may not stop to examine it. I have here a substance which is rather porous--a column of salt--and I will pour into the plate at the bottom, not water, as it appears, but a saturated solution of salt which cannot absorb more; so that the action which you see will not be due to its dissolving anything. We may consider the plate to be the candle, and the salt the wick, and this solution the melted tallow. (I have coloured the fluid, that you may see the action better.) You observe that, now I pour in the fluid, it rises and gradually creeps up the salt higher and higher; and provided the <b>column</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> tumble over, it will go to the top.|$|E
