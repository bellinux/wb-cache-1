50|$|Between 1969 and 1991, TAKRAF built five {{very large}} <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridges</b> {{of the type}} F60 of which four are still in {{operation}} in lignite mines in Lower Lusatia, and one has been preserved as a visitor attraction. These were constructed for removing overburden up to 60 m thick, are 502 m long and span 204 m. They could move originally up to 23000 m3/h, with additional excavators up to 34600 m3/h.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{successful}} completion of the project for measurement of dump heights at <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridges</b> alliances was the start for online digital terrain modelling in real time mode. Important technical equipment of the solution are Laser mirror scanners, GPS in real time kinematic mode, Ethernet based process data networks, ruggedized industry PC and special applications for data handling, storage and visualization. The results are very good and {{turn out to be}} better than expected. On screen applications are practical assistance tools for machine operators. The same view and a couple of special functions were realized for mining engineers. The user front ends were distributed web-based. The application on spreader is presently in progress. ...|$|R
25|$|The McNamara Terminal Parking Structure is an , 10-level facility, {{which opened}} in February 2002. It {{is one of the}} largest parking {{structures}} in the world and includes a ground transportation center, pedestrian bridge, two luggage check-in locations, <b>conveyors</b> and <b>bridges</b> to transport luggage, six restrooms, three offices for parking officials, and two electrical substations. The structure can accommodate 11,489 cars in seven user groups. Parking for the North Terminal is offered in a garage known as the Big Blue Deck. One additional surface lot, named the Green Lot serves as overflow parking. A second surface lot, the Yellow Lot closed April 5, 2012. Four additional, privately owned parking lots are located outside airport grounds (Airlines Parking, Park 'N' Go, Qwik Park, U.S. Park). Motorcycle parking is free at the airport. Motorcycles can be parked in a separate covered area from cars at the McNamara Terminal Parking Structure.|$|R

50|$|The <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> of Espenhain lignite mine with a {{total length}} of 545 m, which started {{operation}} in 1944, could remove an overburden of 45 m thickness.|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> {{was built}} in Plessa lignite mine Agnes {{according}} to plans of mine director Friedrich von Delius. It was scrapped in 1959 after exposure of clay beds made mining in the pit unsafe.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{generally}} present possibilities of the current conveyor use in the well-known active electronic circuits. Current conveyors are able to substitute all known active elements. This claim is supported by the fact, that four basic functional block structures can be realized by use of current conveyors - voltage-controlled voltage source, voltagecontrolled current source, current-controlled current source and current-controlled voltage source. The paper presents particular example of use of functional block structure with current <b>conveyors</b> in Wien <b>bridge</b> oscillator, where it successfully substitutes operational amplifier on the place of active element. Both theoretical formulae and design description are given. Finally, OrCAD PSpice simulation results are presented...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> {{consists}} of girders resting on {{two or three}} supports mounted on rails, or sometimes on crawler tracks. The bridge is set across the pit and moves along the mining face at a few metres per minute. If it runs on rails, the tracks are shifted {{in accordance with the}} progress of the mining. The rock is moved from the excavator to the bridge by connecting conveyors. The dumping support of a <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> may rest on the soil of the seam or on a dumping mound specially poured and packed by the bridge itself, depending on the stability of the rock.|$|E
5000|$|A large <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> with 200 m span and 50 m height, fed by a bucket-wheel excavator, was {{completed}} in 1930 in the Böhlen lignite mine. After it was toppled by a storm in 1937, a replacement went into service in 1939.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{converted}} into a parcels depot which opened on 6 July 1970. Royal Mail constructed a sorting office {{on the opposite side}} of the main line and connected it to Mayfield with an overhead <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> which crossed the throat of Piccadilly Station. The depot closed in 1986 following the decision by Parcelforce, Royal Mail's parcels division, to abandon rail transport in favour of road haulage. The building has remained disused ever since, with the tracks into Mayfield removed in 1989 as part of the remodelling of the Piccadilly Station layout. The sorting office was briefly reused as an indoor karting track, but has now been rebuilt as the Square One development, prestige offices used by Network Rail; the parcel <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> was removed in 2003.|$|E
50|$|The only {{surviving}} structure {{from the}} Tooele smelter site is an ore <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge,</b> which was dismantled and rebuilt into a sky bridge at the Trolley Square mall in Salt Lake City. The bridge passes over 600 South, {{with a small}} informational placard near it in the mall detailing its history.|$|E
50|$|The {{overburden}} <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> of Lichterfeld-Schacksdorf, now shut down, {{was used}} from 1991 until 1992 {{in the brown}} coal mine Klettwitz-Nord near Klettwitz. It is open for visitors today as a project of the Internationale Bauausstellung Fürst-Pückler-Land (International Mining Exhibition Fürst-Pückler-Land) and is an anchor of the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH).|$|E
50|$|Only {{from the}} 1920s {{on the village}} {{developed}} into an industrial location, mainly due to the lignite found in the area. In 1924 {{one of the largest}} lignite mines in the world of its time was opened west of Böhlen. It was equipped with a <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> of 200 m length and 50 m height.|$|E
50|$|Between 2000 and 2010, the Internationale Bauausstellung Fürst-Pückler-Land is {{pursuing}} {{the goal of}} giving new momentum to {{the region and the}} former opencast mine of Klettwitz-Nord has also been integrated into that concept. The mine has been converted into a 'visitors' mine' and the <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> has been accessible since 1998. Various sound and light installations help make the facility an attraction for visitors.|$|E
50|$|Another {{prominent}} {{feature of}} Trolley Square is the sky bridge {{that connects the}} main building to a small parking lot located across the street. The bridge was made from a salvaged ore <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> formerly in use at the International Smelting and Refining Company facility in Tooele, Utah. The bridge goes over 600 South, and it features neon lights shaped {{in the form of}} a trolley.|$|E
5000|$|F60 is {{the series}} {{designation}} of five overburden conveyor bridges used in brown coal (lignite) opencast mining in the Lusatian coalfields in Germany. They were {{built by the}} former Volkseigener Betrieb TAKRAF in Lauchhammer and are the largest movable technical industrial machines in the world. As overburden conveyor bridges, they transport the overburden which lies over the coal seam. The cutting height is 60 m, hence the name F60. With a length of 502 m, it is described as the lying Eiffel tower. In total, the F60 is up to 80 m high and 240 m wide. In operating condition, it weighs 13,600 metric tons. The first <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> was built from 1969 to 1972, being equipped with a feeder bridge in 1977. The second was built from 1972 to 1974, having been equipped with a feeder bridge during construction. The third <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> was built from 1976 to 1978, being provided with a feeder bridge in 1985. The fourth and fifth conveyor bridges were built 1986-1988 and 1988-1991 respectively.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> is a {{piece of}} mining {{equipment}} used in strip mining for the removal of overburden and for dumping it on the inner spoil bank of the open-cut mine. It is used together with multibucket excavators, frequently bucket chain excavators, that remove the overburden which is moved to the bridge by connecting conveyors. Conveyor bridges are used in working horizontally layered deposits with soft overburden rock in areas where mean annual temperatures are above freezing. They are frequently used in lignite mining.|$|E
50|$|Bagger 288 (Excavator 288), {{built by}} the German company Krupp for the energy and mining firm Rheinbraun, is a bucket-wheel {{excavator}} or mobile strip mining machine.When its construction was completed in 1978, Bagger 288 superseded Big Muskie as the heaviest land vehicle in the world, at 13,500 tons. It took five years to design and manufacture, and five years to assemble with total cost reaching $100 million. In 1995, it was itself superseded by the slightly heavier Bagger 293 (14,200 tons). NASA's Crawler-Transporter still remains the largest self-powered land vehicle in the world, since bucket-wheel excavators are powered by an external power source, and the Overburden <b>Conveyor</b> <b>Bridge</b> F60s hold the title of largest land vehicle of any type by physical dimensions.|$|E
50|$|The Bertzit Tower ruin is 35 meters {{high and}} {{located in the}} lowlands, so it is visible from afar. Today it is {{considered}} the oldest investment ruin in the region. The striking shape and resemblance of this building with a Bavarian church tower, and indeed the Lighthouse of Alexandria, was intended and {{can be understood as}} a consequence of industrial heritage. At the turn of the millennium the complex was in danger of being demolished, but instead it was actually placed under conservation. Meanwhile, the complex has been neglected. Many remains of the former brown coal mining industry are located in the region, for example, the Plessa power plant, the Lauchhammer Biotowers (remains of a huge coke oven plant), the briquet company Louise in Domsdorf and the <b>Conveyor</b> <b>Bridge</b> F60.|$|E
50|$|It {{is largely}} unknown why the {{construction}} of this facility was not finished ultimately. Local historians assume the reason to be the technological immaturity of the project, which had never been industrially proven before, and therefore the Bertzit-Tower remained an investment ruin. Brown coal extraction in Kahla was stopped in 1929 due to its unprofitability and the last underground mine {{in the district of}} Liebenwerda, the mine Ada, was shut down the following year. By then brown coal was already being extracted from open-cast mines in Lauchhammer, to which the mine Ada belonged. In 1942 the mining director Friedrich von Delius had the world's first overburden <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> built. The bridge was built according to the director's own plans and was set in the mine Agnes in Plessa, near the mine Ada. It revolutionized the mining process, making it much easier.|$|E
5000|$|Expansion work at Longbridge was {{completed}} in 1979 to allow a new assembly line for the forthcoming new supermini car, which was launched in 1980 as the Austin Metro. The Metro was in production virtually unchanged for 10 years, {{becoming one of the}} most popular cars ever to be produced at the plant. The major part of the expansion was the erection of [...] "New West Works" [...] where the body shells were assembled, with extensive robotic input - a first for British Leyland. The shells were then carried on an enclosed conveyor over the Bristol Road to the Car Assembly Buildings (CAB) in South Works, where the cars were assembled and tested. This arrangement endured until car production at Longbridge ceased in 2005. Indeed, the overhead <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> was one of the first features to go when demolition of the plant began.|$|E
40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} based on {{creation}} of a simulation model of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> between a paint-shop and an assembly hall in the company Škoda Auto, a. s. in Mladá Boleslav. The model {{was created in the}} simulation software Plant Simulation on the grounds of an existing model in simulation software SimPro. Analysis of the existing model in software SimPro as well as a system analysis of conveyors used in the respected production section is carried out in the thesis. Results of simulation experiments accomplished with the newly created model follow. These experiments verify the throughput rate for various production programmes. On the grounds of these results a bottleneck analysis of the conveyor system is carried out and arrangements leading to increase in its throughput rate are made...|$|E
40|$|Within a {{few years}} after the German reunification, most open pit lignite mines in the Central German Lignite Mining District have been shut down leaving more than 200 km" 2 of devastated land in Saxony (Germany) even now. These areas are in demand of short term conceptions for future landuse and {{suitable}} recultivation methods. This thesis investigates, how thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing in particular can provide valuable information, which is required to assist the landuse planning in identifying and classifying critical areas. In order to establish the mining of the lignitic seams the overburden Quaternary and Tertiary sediments had been removed and dumped in <b>conveyor</b> <b>bridge</b> dumps. The Tertiary sediments contain the mineral pyrite, which reacts to sulfuric acid under wet oxidizing conditions. The acidification of the dumps is not only strongly affecting the chemical characteristics of groundwater and residual lakes but also the stability of slopes leaving the risk of slides and subsidences. For a risk assessment of the affected areas the geochemical and mineralogical composition as well as compositional changes of the dumps have to be explored. This is giving strong motivation for the application of remote sensing methods to answer the short term demands of landuse planners. (orig.)
