2500|$|When a {{route is}} set at a {{junction}} that involves the train taking a diverging route that must be passed at less than the mainline speed, a system known as approach release is used. There {{are a number of}} different types of approach release that are used on British railways but the most often used is approach release from red. This system has the signal before the diverging junction held at red until the train approaches it, whereupon it changes to a less restrictive aspect with the appropriate direction feather of five white lights. This is required so that the signals approaching show the correct <b>caution</b> <b>aspects,</b> slowing the train down for the junction. [...] While the junction signal is held at red, the preceding signal will be displaying caution (yellow), and the one before that will display preliminary caution (double yellow) if it is a 4-aspect signal. This system allows for a gradual decrease in speed until a safe speed is reached for the train to move through the junction.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are certain}} high <b>caution</b> <b>aspects</b> of ethical {{marketing}} {{in terms of}} market audience.

Examples of market exclusion or selective marketing are certain company’s attitudes towards the gay, ethnic groups and overweight (plus size) market groups. Customers are treated like this because companies {{think that they are}} unprofitable so they try to deprive them or avoid them altogether. It is often debated amongst the business community that in order to be profitable, often businesses have to be unethical. However, this idea is seemingly outdated as most businesses nowadays follow an ethical business plan. In the United States, plus size apparel is thought to have generated $17.5 billion between May 2013 and April 2014, which is a 5% increase from the previous year, this is to be expected as 65% of American women are plus sized [...] Another example of exclusion from the market is some pharmaceutical industry’s exclude developing countries from AIDS drugs ...|$|R

500|$|In {{the twelve}} seconds between brake {{application}} and brake release, the train {{passed over the}} fixed AWS magnet for signal SN43, which was displaying a single yellow (<b>caution)</b> <b>aspect.</b> This warning was cancelled in time. The train then passed over the TPWS+ overspeed sensor for signal SN45, which was displaying a red (danger) aspect.

40|$|In 1991, 2001, and 2008 {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} to determine pilot perceptions of automated flight decks or “glass cockpits. ” Results from these similar surveys indicated {{that a number of}} factors identified remained the same. However, over time, some changes in perceptions were noted. The 2008 survey provided airline pilots the opportunity to write comments and express their ideas and concerns about aspects of the glass cockpit. This paper provides a qualitative analysis of their comments identified as a number of themes. Their perceptions of themes such as situational awareness, automation and technology, skills, stress, workload, and computer literacy are examined. Overall, the perceptions of the glass cockpit are positive. However, there remains an underlying <b>caution</b> concerning several <b>aspects</b> of piloting including perceived loss of manual flying skills, stress, and extreme workload resulting from the potential over-reliance and pervasiveness of computerized technology on the flight deck...|$|R

50|$|Dwarf {{signals are}} usually {{positioned}} {{on the left}} of the tracks and only apply to that track. In case it is positioned on the right hand side of the track it has an illuminated indicator (arrow) to make clear for which track it is valid. They are set to allow the passage of trains as well as the standard light signals for mainline movements. The last dwarf signal before entering the main line will show a Proceed aspect for a train or a Proceed with <b>caution</b> <b>aspect</b> for a shunting movement.|$|E
50|$|Directional {{indicators}} {{have been}} introduced to resolve the ambiguity that may arise when a medium aspect (green over yellow) can precede either a <b>caution</b> <b>aspect</b> (green over red) {{or one of the}} turnout aspects (yellow over red/yellow). The indicator is provided at the signal(s) in rear of a junction signal. When illuminated it displays a white bar, inclined at 45 degrees to the left or right, placed above the main signal heads. The bar is not lit when the next signal applies to the straight route, but is illuminated when the next signal applies to the turnout. The white indicator is proved to be alight before the yellow is displayed.|$|E
40|$|On June 15, 2005, the Inter-American Court {{issued its}} {{judgment}} in Moiwana Village v.

50|$|Under 'route signalling', {{the aspects}} {{necessary}} to control speed do not exist, so a system known as approach release is employed. This involves holding the junction signal at a restrictive aspect (typically 'stop') {{so that the}} signals on the approach show the correct sequence of caution aspects. The driver brakes {{in accordance with the}} <b>caution</b> <b>aspect,</b> without necessarily being aware that the diverging route has in fact been set. As the train approaches the junction signal, its aspect may clear to whatever aspect the current track occupancy ahead permits. Where the turnout speed is the same, or nearly the same, as the mainline speed, approach release is unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|The next signal, SN45 was {{displaying}} a red (danger) aspect. By {{the time the}} driver saw this, there was insufficient distance available to stop the train, which eventually came to a stand on the junction some 700 yd past the signal. The service train that was being protected by the red signal had already passed through the junction and no collision occurred. As the points had already moved for {{the passage of the}} charter train, no damage was done to the trackwork at Wooton Bassett Jn. The line speed approaching the junction was 70 mph for the service train. Before he was relieved from driving duties, the driver of the charter train claimed that signal SN43 had displayed a green (proceed) aspect. NR investigations showed that a single yellow (<b>caution)</b> <b>aspect</b> was displayed.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1920s, distant signals were {{coloured}} red, with a {{red light}} at night. Given that their meanings were different, it was obviously unsatisfactory to have both home and distant signals showing the same colour, {{but one of the}} problems which delayed a change in the colour of distant signals to yellow was the lack of a suitable yellow glass for the spectacle frame. Some British railway companies used the Coligny-Welch signal lamp to clarify night aspects; this was fitted to distant signals and showed a white vee in addition to the main red or green light. The Ministry of Transport recommended that the colour of distant signal arms and spectacles be altered from red to yellow in the early 1920s, although this was not universally adopted in the UK until the late 1920s. Since this time, the yellow <b>caution</b> <b>aspect</b> has remained a British railway standard.|$|E
5000|$|Due to misting and exhaust obstructing the driver's {{view through}} the window, the driver drove leaning {{out of the}} cab for much of the time. A side effect of this was that it made hearing the AWS sounder harder, as well as {{observation}} of a flashing light fitted in the cab to remind a driver of an AWS warning. Approaching signal SN43, there was a temporary speed restriction of 85 mph, which was warned of by a temporary AWS magnet in advance of the restriction, and indicated by a sign {{at the start of the}} temporary speed restriction. The train approached signal SN43 at 59 mph and passed over the temporary AWS magnet. The driver failed to react to the warning given within the time allowed and the brakes were applied. Because the AWS isolating cock was out of reach of the driver, he instructed the fireman to open it for him. The train's speed had reduced by about 8 mph when the brakes were released. The rules require that the train is brought to a stand and the signaller contacted in the event of an AWS brake application. Additionally the driver must inform the signaller whenever the AWS is isolated;"Driver: If it becomes necessary to isolate the AWS, you must:* stop your train immediately* tell the signaller* not move the train until instructed to do so* carry out the instructions given." [...] The train then passed signal SN43, which was displaying a single yellow (<b>caution)</b> <b>aspect.</b> The driver acknowledged the AWS warning, but did not reduce speed.In the twelve seconds between brake application and brake release, the train passed over the fixed AWS magnet for signal SN43, which was displaying a single yellow (<b>caution)</b> <b>aspect.</b> This warning was cancelled in time. The train then passed over the TPWS+ overspeed sensor for signal SN45, which was displaying a red (danger) aspect. As the train was travelling more slowly than the trigger speed, no brake action was demanded from the train. The train then passed over the second TPWS overspeed sensor for signal SN45, this time at 53 mph, which was in excess of the 45 mph trigger speed. Consequently, a TPWS intervention occurred, but as the AWS isolating cock was open the brakes did not apply. When the driver saw that signal SN45 was at danger, he applied the brakes on the train. Due to there being insufficient distance to stop, the train overran the signal by 550 m and came to a stand across Wootton Basset Junction.|$|E
5000|$|On 31 May 1985, 1D91 09:20 Gatwick Airport to Victoria Gatwick express formed of [...] GLV, [...] 8301, 8203, 8313, [...] 73117 {{collided}} with 2L51 08:51 East Grinstead to Victoria formed of DEMU [...] 1113 and [...] 1309 travelling along the up fast main line from Clapham Junction. Train 1D91 was following 2L51 along the Up Fast line, through Clapham Junction station, {{at which the}} latter train had made a scheduled stop and beyond towards Battersea Park. 1D91 had closed sufficiently on 2L51 that the former passed a series of signals displaying a 'single yellow' <b>caution</b> <b>aspect,</b> at which the driver cancelled the AWS warning and continued, as he was entitled to, at a speed of around 30 mile/h. Train 2L51 was then stopped for 1-2 minutes at signal VC552 displaying a red aspect. When that signal cleared, 2L51 was accelerating past it when it was struck from behind by 1D91 which had passed the protecting signal, VC564, at Danger. A consensus of evidence suggests {{that at the moment}} of collision 2L51 had reached a speed of between 5 and 10 mile/h, whilst ID91 was still travelling at between 25 and 30 mile/h, so that the net collision speed was about 20 mile/h. After the collision the trains separated and came to rest 20m apart. There was no derailment but the shock of collision passing down each train caused damage throughout the length of both. Only one vehicle sustained severe structural damage; this was the leading passenger coach of 1D91, running immediately behind the GLV. This coach sustained a small degree of telescoping at underframe level, and hinging down of its trailing end, so that the saloon floor buckled upwards by about 600mm with consequent displacement of seats in one bay. One window each side was broken when this deformation occurred through the window opening, but the general integrity of the vehicles could be judged by the fact that these were the only external windows broken throughout the two trains. The trains were conveying a large number of passengers, one estimate being as high as 800. In the collision 104 persons suffered injury and were taken to two hospitals by means of ten ambulances, the first of which arrived at 09:58. Most of the injured suffered only cuts and bruises and were discharged after treatment, but eighteen had serious injuries requiring detention in hospital for periods between one and fourteen nights. Twenty other passengers later reported having suffered injury. The uninjured passengers were conveyed forward to Victoria at 10:58 by a special train, the unobstructed Slow lines having been re-energised for electric trains at 10:45 after an initial complete isolation of the conductor rails in the area. During the day the damaged trains were made fit to move and hauled into sidings so that, there being no damage to the track or signalling equipment, normal working was resumed at 16:12.|$|E
40|$|Train drivers {{navigate}} conventionally designed railways using a keen {{awareness of}} their routes and by calculating likelihood predictions of future states.

The paper seeks to describe the train drivers’ experience of interpreting and responding to railway signals, so that the signal engineering community may better understand the implications of introducing new variables and schemes into their signal design language...|$|E
