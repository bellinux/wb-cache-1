5|$|Among the {{buildings}} extant {{at the royal}} city {{during the time of}} King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810), only the original Mahandrihono palace remains intact. The Mahandrihono palace, which served as the home of Andrianampoinimerina before he relocated the political capital of Imerina to Antananarivo, has been preserved in its original state since construction, excepting the replacement of the original roof thatch with wooden shingles. The simple wooden structure is constructed in the traditional style of the aristocracy of Imerina: the walls are made of solid rosewood and topped by a peaked roof that is supported by 10-meter central rosewood pillar, much like the one that had originally supported the roof of the Rova Manjakamiadana of Antananarivo before it was destroyed by fire in 1995. The roof horns (tandrotrano) formed {{at each end of the}} roof peak by the crossing of the gable beams were originally silver-plated, and a silver eagle was affixed in the middle of the roof peak. Silver ornaments were also hung from the corners of the roof in the interior of the house. The building's name is inscribed on a white marble plaque affixed to an exterior wall near one of the building's two entrances. This house contains a number of items that belonged to Andrianampoinimerina, including weapons, drums, talismans and a bed raised on stilts. During Andrianampoinimerina's time, his wives were allowed to visit this building but not allowed to sleep there overnight. The site is highly sacred: Queen Rasoherina and her successors often sat on the stepping stone at its threshold to address their audience, and many pilgrims <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to connect with the spirits of Andrianampoinimerina and his ancestors. Visitors are asked to enter the house by stepping in with their right foot and exiting backwards, according to custom, in order to show respect for the spirit of Andrianampoinimerina.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the acoustic correlates of the semantic phenomenon of focus. Focus By the term focus roughly the following phenomenon is intended. In a normal declarative sentence what is asserted by the sentence can be controlled by a change of stress. Consider the following examples, where the word that is stressed is italicized. (1) Bill <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in a car. (2) Bill <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in a car. (3) Bill <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in a car. The same effect can be achieved syntactically by clefting. (4) It was Bill who <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in a car. (5) It was a car Bill <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in. In (1) we are asserting about Bill that he <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in a car. In (2) and (3) something different is asserted; in (2) we know that someone came here: what is asserted is that it was Bill, in (3) we know that Bill <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in some fashion and assert that it was in a car.
