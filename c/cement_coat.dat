40|$|Sheep {{were used}} {{as a model for}} the {{examination}} of radiological and histological changes in bone tissue following total hip replacement. A unilateral total hip replacement procedure was carried out in sheep with radiological examinations at 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery. After six moths, the sheep were euthanized and the bone tissue was collected for histology. The histological examination was focused on superficial reactive changes, bone reactive changes and type and numbers of the cells present. Radiological examination showed no pathological changes. Histological examination revealed new bone formation and remodelling in all samples, three of them (12. 5 %) exhibiting changes in resorption and new bone formation at the osteoid level. Cellular reaction involving the presence of reactive cells was minimal in all samples (macrophages, fibroblasts). Changes characteristic of the development of completely mature bone with evident bone structures, including the Hawers system, were observed in eleven samples (45. 83 %). Disturbances of intactness of the <b>cement</b> <b>coat</b> resulted in cellular activity and aseptic loosening. In our case, cellular activity was minimal and some samples allowed us to observe signs of mature bones which indicated strong fixation of endoprosthesis in the bone tissue and alterations at cellular level ongoing even at sixth months following the total hip replacement.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Infected {{nonunion}} of long bones is {{a chronic}} and debilitating disorder. It {{is more difficult}} to deal with when the implant used for internal fixation itself becomes a potential media for infection because of bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation.

This study has been undertaken to explore antibiotic <b>cement</b> <b>coated</b> nailing as single stage treatment modality for treating infection and achieving stability at the same time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients (above 18 years age) with infected nonunion of tibia with bone gap less than 2 cm were managed using antibiotic <b>cement</b> <b>coated</b> K-nail. Antibiotic <b>cement</b> nail was prepared using endotracheal tube method. Antibiotics used were a combination of vancomycin and teicoplanin. RESULTS: Infection was controlled in 95...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this research study was to observe {{the changes in the}} physical properties of <b>cement</b> <b>coated</b> secondary aggregates, namely surface roughness and angle of internal friction and how these properties are related to the performance of Open Graded Friction Course asphalt mixtures, OGFC made from these materials under laboratory Uniaxial, deformation and rutting testing simulating the traffic loading and temperature of the materials in service. The secondary aggregates, namely Croxden natural gravel aggregates, which is rejected by road engineers for use in road surfacing was upgraded with a specifically designed <b>cement</b> <b>coating.</b> Asphalt mixtures mechanical properties in terms of stiffness modulus, deformations and rutting were determined and analyzed using state-of-the-art laboratory test equipment and supported by technical literature from different information and resources. Three aggregate types were considered in this study; Arcow rock crushed aggregates(as a control aggregate), Croxden aggregate (as a secondary or low quality aggregates) and <b>cement</b> <b>coated</b> Croxden aggregate (as an upgraded material). One aggregate gradation was designed for all mixture types and the adopted aggregate gradation had a nominal maximum aggregate size (NMAS) of 14 mm. Two binder types were selected, 100 / 150 pen binder and 40 / 60 pen binder to represent the soft and hard binders respectively that are commonly used by road engineers. This research also documents a survey of literature review that led to the design of a novel machine that is eagerly needed by the pavement industry to boost the knowledge and understanding of real tyre-road interaction. Computer software, SOLIDWORKS, was used to create a 3 -dimentional model of the machine that was jointly named by the Highway Agency and Tarmac ltd., as Low Cost Asphalt Tasting Equipment (LoCATE). The machine was designed for use {{and for the first time}} to investigate the performance of the said mixtures under real traffic loading and environmental conditions and to correlate its results with those obtained using Repeated Load Indirect Tensile Test (RLIT) and Repeated Load Axial Test (RLAT), which were carried out at 10 °C, 20 °C, 30 °C and 45 °C. At an advanced stage of this research work and when the cost of fabricating LoCATE was found impossible to be met by LJMU, wheel tracking tests were done on the materials studied as a replacement of LoCATE and this part of the research program was achieved at Wolverhampton's bituminous testing laboratories in collaboration with Tarmac Ltd. In general, the results of this research investigation indicate that the introduction of <b>cement</b> <b>coated</b> aggregates to OGFC led to an outstanding improvement in the chemical properties of the coated natural aggregates and the stiffness and deformation properties/resistance of the road mixtures containing them. This was in comparison with that made from the uncoated aggregates in all the tests that have been carried out within this research study. Also, the effects of elevated temperature were investigated and it was found to have significant influence on the engineering properties, Indirect Tensile Stiffness Moduli (ITSM) and permanent deformation/rutting characteristic of the mixtures were also investigated. Outstanding new results were achieved, using LJMU <b>cement</b> <b>coating</b> paste for coating the waste natural aggregate and as thus this will hopefully eliminate the restriction imposed by road engineers on the use of natural gravel aggregates in road pavement surfacing layers. This is an outstanding knowledge extension in this field and marks a starting point for more research in this ever growing industry i. e. the use of waste and recycled aggregates in construction industry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Tool wear/tool life of PVD <b>cemented</b> <b>coated</b> carbide {{material}} in machining superalloy In 718 {{has been studied}} by different methods. Self-organization theory {{is one of the}} effective ways to explain tool wear/tool life. In this paper, worn and fractured surfaces of the cutting tools were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Self-organization of cutting tools during wear process was analyzed through SEM and EDS analysis. The results revealed that built-up edge and oxygen-containing surface film were two forms of tool self-organization in high speed turning of In 718 with PVD cemented carbide inserts. Self-organization of the cutting tools took place with all kinds of wear mechanism during cutting. They affected the cutting tools in opposite directions with tool wear mechanisms, reducing the tool wear, protecting the loss of the tool materials effectively.
