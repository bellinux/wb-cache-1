At the July 2007 SA International <b>Convention</b> a <b>survey</b> was conducted of 176 SA members. Asked the object of their sexual fantasy and acting out, 23% nominated same-sex and a further 7% indicated both genders. [...] Topic meetings on same-sex issues are held at SA International Conferences and personal stories of same-sex recovery appear in Essay, the official SA quarterly publication. There also exist other organizations which serve such individuals; see Ex-gay.|$|R

While perceptual ambiguities are resolved with prior constraints, artistic ambiguities are resolved by conventions. Is there a relationship between priors and <b>conventions?</b> This review <b>surveys</b> recent work related to these ambiguities in composition, spatial scale, illumination and color, three-dimensional layout, shape, and movement. While most conventions seem to have their roots in perceptual constraints, those conventions that differ from priors may help us appreciate how visual arts differ from everyday perception...|$|R

They {{have a significant effect}} upon the global safety of the civil air transportation system. This dissertation aims at describing the existing regulations in the field of pilot licensing. Its scope is narrowed down to the highest category of licence applicable to professional pilots and known as the airline transport pilot licence. The thesis depicts and analyses the process of creation and the contents of licensing standards and recommended practices as developed by various ICAO bodies and incorporated in Annex 1 to the Chicago <b>Convention.</b> The <b>survey</b> of pilot licensing system currently in force in Canada provides the example of domestic legislation applicable in this respect.

This study evaluated the attributes of a possible reward program for convention attendees. Attendees at a large international <b>convention</b> completed a <b>survey</b> on which they rated potential reward program attributes and benefits. Benefits were classified into four primary dimensions: monetary, redemption, functional, and recognition; and two secondary categories: tangible–intangible and direct–indirect. Attendees prefer tangible, monetary rewards directly related to the convention. Suggestions are provided for creating effective reward programs that could increase loyalty for conventions...|$|R

40|$|Communicating how class content can satisfy students’ {{personal}} interests and goals—referred to as content relevance—is an important teaching behavior {{that has been}} linked to numerous indices of student success in school. However, no known studies have examined teachers’ communication of content relevance in K- 12 physical education. The {{purpose of this study was}} two-fold: (a) to determine the extent to which physical education teachers report communicating content relevance, based on their status as either elementary or secondary teachers, years of teaching experience (3 ̆c 5 years vs. 3 ̆e 10 years) and level of expertise (expert vs. novice), and (b) to identify ways in which the teachers apply this communication behavior when teaching. One hundred and three K- 12 physical education teachers attending a state physical education <b>convention</b> were <b>surveyed</b> using an established scale from classroom research. Additionally, participants provided written examples of how they communicated content relevance in their physical education classes. Between-group differences in self-reported communication behavior were analyzed using three separate one-way Analyses of Variance (ANOVA). The teachers’ examples were categorized and organized into themes. Results indicated the only factor accounting for significant differences in teacher communication was teacher expertise, with experts reporting higher frequency of using content relevance strategies than novices. Themes identified in the teachers’ examples served to illustrate multiple ways relevance can be infused into physical education instruction...|$|R
40|$|Convention travel {{has been}} growing rapidly {{throughout}} the world {{in recent years and}} becoming a critical component of the hospitality and travel industry. Hosting of conventions, especially international conventions, can be used by host countries as part of a strategic marketing plan to publicize modern development, traditional culture, and tourism resources. It also stimulates economic growth in the hosting country. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the differences between the expenditures of delegates staying in hotels and delegates not staying in hotels in each category. It was expected that most of delegates staying in hotels were foreigners and most of delegates not staying in hotels were local people. A questionnaire was developed by using the categories of the 1993 IACVB <b>Convention</b> Income <b>Survey</b> as a base and executed in Taiwan. The subsequent data allowed the comparison between expenditures of the delegates staying in hotels and the delegates not staying in hotels. Overall, the average spending per delegate was US$ 621. 62 in this sample study. The delegate staying in a hotel spent an average of 6. 79 times the amount the delegate not staying in a hotel in this 4 day meeting. Recommendations for further studies were suggested. Additional research would help Taiwan determine the economic impact of the convention industry on the local economy in the future. Such research would also serve as a base for the convention industry positioning itself to receive future government support...|$|R

40|$|Class of 2014 AbstractSpecific Aims: To {{increase}} {{the use of}} best practices by pharmacy preceptors within their own settings and to identify if live continuing education presentations are considered superior {{to other forms of}} CE presentation. Subjects: Pharmacists attending the “Quest for the Best: Best Practices for Pharmacy Preceptors” CE program at the Arizona Pharmacy Alliance 2013 Annual <b>Convention.</b> Methods: <b>Surveys</b> administered before, after, and 6 months following the CE program collected data concerning the use of syllabi for rotations, the type and quantity of expected projects, frequency of student oversight, and feedback opportunities. Follow-up surveys assessed preferred forms of CE delivery. A survey administered six months following the CE’s conclusion identified changes made at the subjects’ sites {{as a result of the}} CE. Main Results: Surveys were completed by 20 pharmacy preceptors (mean years of experience = 5. 95; SD = 5. 36). 86 % of the subjects preferred the live CE; 5 % would have preferred the CE be delivered as a webinar. Chi-square testing found no statistically significant difference between pre-CE use of syllabus, frequency of student monitoring, and frequency of given feedback compared to 6 -months post-CE (p = 0. 59, 0. 57, 0. 30 respectively). Conclusion: The CE program did not demonstrate a difference among attending pharmacy preceptors in incorporating a syllabus at their site, altering monitoring of student, or time provided for feedback. Live CE was found to be the most desired at imparting best practices to pharmacy preceptors. 86 % of responders reported changing their site practices as a result of the CE presentation...|$|R
30|$|The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) of 1979 and its eight {{protocols}} {{are aimed}} at limiting and reducing air pollutants. Under the LRTAP convention, the European monitoring and evaluation programme (EMEP) gathers information on emission from its parties, collects data on air and precipitation quality and models atmospheric transport and deposition of air pollutants [1]. Beyond this, biomonitoring programmes provide data on concentrations in various biological matrices potentially correlated with atmospheric deposition of heavy metals (HM). Within the LRTAP <b>convention,</b> European Moss <b>Survey</b> (EMS) is conducted using naturally growing mosses as biomonitors of atmospheric deposition of air pollutants. Since 1990, moss specimens have been sampled every 5  years at up to 7300 sampling sites in up to 35 countries [2 – 4] to determine the concentrations of heavy metals (HM), nitrogen (N, since 2005) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs, since 2010) [4, 5]. The EMS is coordinated by the ICP Vegetation, an international cooperative programme (ICP) reporting on impacts of air pollution on vegetation to the LRTAP convention [3].|$|R

The results indicated that policy PR had positive influences on policy efficacy and policy support, and that policy efficacy had positive influences on policy support. Especially, providing policy information and policy efficacy directly related on regional convention industry influenced on policy support. The study also found that policy efficacy mediate the relation of policy PR and policy support. Thus, it is important to make policy publics better understand policy efficacy to gain policy support. The study suggested policy PR strategies be based on balanced communication through policy efficacy to get policy support in regional convention industry policy...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the impact of housemothers in an all-male national Greek fraternity. Specifically, it asked if the link established between Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) and Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) in the workplace is also present in organizational settings on college campuses, an important question because the housemother is an organizational leader whose voice is missing in both the college and leadership literature and because the housemother is often overlooked {{as a source of}} support in helping counteract fraternity problems like alcohol abuse and hazing. ^ This study used LMX 7 and OCB measures to establish that there was a correlation between the LMX of a housemother and fraternity member and his organizational citizenship behaviors. A survey that included Likert scales and demographic questions was used to measure perceptions of satisfaction with various aspects of fraternity living and to determine if fraternity chapters experience fewer problems with alcohol abuse and hazing if a housemother is present. ^ The preliminary study surveyed 218 undergraduate and alumni members of the fraternity at its biennial national <b>convention.</b> The <b>survey</b> was replicated with 204 undergraduate members of the same fraternity in four Midwestern chapters (two with housemothers and two without). The researcher personally administered the surveys at all locations. The researcher also traveled to five Midwestern chapters of the fraternity where she interviewed five housemothers to explain the outcomes of the quantitative studies. ^ In addition to establishing that there was a correlation between the LMX of a housemother and fraternity member and that member 2 ̆ 7 s organizational citizenship behaviors, important findings included fraternity members reporting a higher incidence of chapters forbidding alcohol in their houses if a housemother was present and the members 2 ̆ 7 reported belief that a housemother was one of the factors that makes a positive difference in the fraternity. ...|$|R
40|$|Response rates can be {{calculated}} by various means, allowing the researchers the usage of different disposition codes, which in turn can result in vastly different response rates for the same survey. One of the most comprehensive reporting conventions is the ‘Standard Definitions’ by the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), which describes specific definitions of disposition codes and various outcome rates in great detail, allowing for only a marginal variance of results. In this inquiry, {{we aim to document}} the reporting of response rates and other survey characteristics in recent publications of scientific journals. Our analyses are based on two sample of articles, which allow a comparison with earlier reviews as well as between different scientific disciplines. Our findings show, that while there is an overall increase in the reporting of response rates and other defining survey characteristics, these improvements are from universal. While the AAPOR standard might be considered an established <b>convention</b> within the <b>survey</b> research community, other disciplines of the social sciences can be considered far more heterogeneous in their reporting styles. A comparison between social sciences and public health journals reveals further a mostly similar reporting pattern, with only specific details underreported in the latter...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{perceived}} health status, health behaviors, family values and relationships of a select group of Nepalese in the US. Nepalese are a small minority group most often categorized in the U. S. under the Asian and Pacific Islanders cluster. A modified BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) survey was used to facilitate comparison with U. S. national data. One hundred and ten people attending an annual Nepalese <b>convention</b> completed the <b>survey.</b> Results indicated that although smoking behavior of Nepalese was similar to that of Americans, cancer screening and exercise behaviors varied significantly. Several methodological issues with regard to data collection were encountered. Most notably, the respondents skipped many BRFSS questions. This raises some significant questions about the representation of Nepalese Americans and other Asian and Pacific Islander groups in the national BRFSS data. Under-representation of Nepalese may be masking significant health problems among members of this so-called “model minority”, and in effect limiting their representation in the national health care agenda. Different and varied methodologies need to be employed to better understand the health care needs of this and other Asian and Pacific Islander groups...|$|R
40|$|Europe has the {{greatest}} concentration of botanic gardens in the world, they cultivate extensive collections of plants that include samples of European threatened plant species. This study looks at {{the effectiveness of these}} collections in supporting species conservation. A three part study is presented: (1) the results of a survey and assessment of threatened plants in botanic gardens, as defined by the Bern Convention; (2) case studies illustrating current issues in the ex situ management of European threatened plant species; and (3) presentation of policy recommendations on further improving botanic garden contributions to European plant conservation. The survey indicated that of 119 European botanic gardens in 29 European countries, 105 are cultivating 308 of the 573 threatened plant species listed by the Bern <b>Convention.</b> The <b>survey</b> identified 25 botanic gardens in 14 countries undertaking 51 conservation projects focused on 27 Bern listed species. In particular this survey has established that the majority of taxa are held in a small number of collections, dominated by non-wild origin accessions, and are not adequately documented. The majority of specimens in botanic gardens are cultivated out of the range country and not contributing to a specific conservation project. We review the genetic representation and documentation of origin in collections. Existing plant collections contain representatives of populations, now lost in the wild and maintain samples of at least nine European plant taxa identified as 'Extinct in the Wild'. However, inadequate standards of record keeping has compromised the conservation value of many collections. We highlight the dangers of hybridisation and disease in ex situ collections. The results suggest that botanic garden collections are skewed towards horticulturally robust and ornamental species and do not fully reflect priorities as defined by the Bern Convention. Recognising the limitations of traditional botanic garden collections we propose that botanic gardens more effectively utilise their two core competencies, namely scientific horticulture and public display and interpretation. The unique horticultural skills resident in European botanic gardens could be more effectively utilised through the application of horticulture to the management of wild populations...|$|R
40|$|The aimof {{this article}} is threefold: first, {{a brief history of}} drama {{translation}} as exchange of dramatic texts will be outlined. Throughout the history of theatre, texts have crossed boundaries and helped to establish new systems, or have given new blood to old systems. Second, a terminological clarification will be given in order to dispel the confusion which has sometimes surrounded terms such as “drama translation”, “dramatic text”, “theatre translation” and “theatre text”. These terms have often been used interchangeably, but “drama translation” is not synonymous with “theatre translation”, as “dramatic text” is not with “theatre text”. Dramatic texts and theatre texts, in fact, function as objects or elements in different systems and are governed by different systemic <b>conventions.</b> Third, a <b>survey</b> of themajor theoretical contributions will be presented. Interest in drama translation from a theoretical point of view started in the late 1970 s, with contemporary translation scholars initially highly influenced by semiotics. More recently, however, they have turned their attention to new, and perhapsmore profitable,means of investigation. From a cultural perspective, they have categorised specific translation strategies and used themto study {{the ways in which the}} discourse of foreign source texts is integrated in translation into the discourse of the target society...|$|R

40|$|It {{has often}} been claimed that it is {{impossible}} to measure human capabilities but within the methodological <b>conventions</b> of household <b>survey</b> design, this chapter shows that some non-financial capability indicators do already exist and this chapter demonstrates how similar indicators, covering a wide range of life domains, can be constructed. This chapter draws on a continuing research project which contributes to the operationalization of the capabilities approach by devising over sixty capability indicators which can be used to extend coverage of indices such as HDI, illustrating different ways in which such indicators may be analysed, and discussing some of the associated methodological issues that have emerged in the process. Based on usable observations from a national UK sample of 1, 000 adults, this chapter uses latent class analysis to identify an impoverished group of respondents with low capabilities across the board, builds models of experienced violence and subjective wellbeing as a function of experienced and anticipated violence, and explores the relationship between capability indicators and subjective wellbeing. Substantive findings include: the identification of a group with low all round capabilities associated with low health and low income; evidence that fear of future violence can be a more significant determinant of subjective wellbeing than past experience of violence; and evidence which supports the view that a large diverse set of non-financial dimensions of capability have a detectable impact on subjective wellbeing. The chapter concludes by discussing some of the econometric issues that have emerged in the course of this work...|$|R
40|$|Teacher {{turnover}} {{is high in}} schools, {{identifying the}} factors may possibly lead to solutions to reduce this problem. Factors of teacher turnover in private and public schools were researched through the literature review and factors were identified. The goal of this descriptive study is to provide information on teacher turnover for administrators in a state association of Christian schools. A research table was developed through the literature review, {{which led to the}} pilot survey where a team of experts, the coordinator of the state association of Christian schools, one high school principal, two elementary principals, and three headmasters, made recommendations. This pilot study was conducted in two Christian schools not affiliated with the association studied. Following the pilot study, the final survey was published in the state association of Christian school’s booklet prepared for the convention. This dissertation is unique in that all who attended the state association of Christian school’s <b>convention</b> received a <b>survey</b> as they walked into the main auditorium. The coordinator of the association encouraged the participants to complete the <b>survey</b> at the <b>convention</b> by announcing the survey at the main session. The surveys were collected as the participants exited the main auditorium. The surveys were tallied and statistical analysis was conducted through descriptive statistics and reported to participating administrators. The results from the survey identified the school control factors in teacher turnover in the association of Christian schools as finances/low pay, lack of administrative support and lack of quality administration. Stress/burnout contributes to both school control factors and outside school control factors. The outside school control factors that contribute to teacher turnover in the association of Christian schools include spouse relocation and God’s calling...|$|R

The editing {{of writing}} is {{included}} {{as part of}} the writing process; however, this component of the process is problematic and often is not discussed. The editing of writing is often included {{as part of the}} revision process, when in actuality, they are two separate processes. For this reason, students struggle with how to edit which leads to the teacher editing the writing instead of the student. The purpose of the use of an editing protocol is to create independent self-editors during the writing process. Sources of Data 	A pre and post writing assessment was administered to both the experimental and control group. Writing convention errors were calculated on three samples between the pre and post writing assessments for the experimental group. Rubric scores measured improvement in the area of content and <b>conventions.</b> 	A student <b>survey</b> was administered to the experimental group, which consisted of 30 fourth grade students prior to the treatment period {{as well as at the}} conclusion of the treatment to ensure metalinguistic awareness development. Conclusions Reached 	The editing protocol allowed students to edit a peers writing as well as served as a reference tool when composing their own writing. The editing cards enabled students to edit their own work. The editing intervention treatment successfully reduced the number of editing errors in writing conventions in the experimental group. 	The results of the surveys indicated that students see the editing cards as a resource as well as a strategy in producing a well-written piece of writing. Following this intervention students also appeared to have a better, more realistic definition of what it takes to be a good writer and editor. Education (Language and Literacy...|$|R
