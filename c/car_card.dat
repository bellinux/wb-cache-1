5000|$|Eastern New England English {{encompasses}} Boston and Maine accents, and, {{according to}} some sources, the distinct Rhode Island accent. All Eastern New England English is famous for non-rhoticity, meaning it drops the r sound everywhere except before a vowel: thus, in words like <b>car,</b> <b>card,</b> fear, and chowder (...) [...] The phrase Park the car in Harvard Yard - dialectally transcribed [...] - is commonly used as a shibboleth, or speech indicator, for the non-rhotic Eastern New England dialect running from Boston north to Maine, which contrasts with the generally rhotic dialects elsewhere in North America. In all of Eastern New England, except Rhode Island, words like caught and cot are pronounced identically (both are often rounded, thus: [...] ), because those two vowel sounds have fully merged. A phenomenon called Canadian raising occurs throughout Eastern New England, causing writer {{to have a different}} stressed vowel sound than rider, and for the verb house to have a different vowel sound than the noun house. [...] and [...] have relatively back starting positions. The horse-hoarse distinction is still present to some extent in some areas, as well as the Mary-marry-merry distinction in many speakers.|$|E

40|$|Sociophonetic {{variation}} presents us with {{challenges and}} opportunities. This paper focuses on {{an area of}} phonetic variation which is particularly rich and informative about the social exploitation of {{the complexities of the}} acoustics-articulatory relationship – namely fine-grained variation and change in Scottish English coda /r/. Scottish English is typically thought to be 'rhotic' (e. g. Wells 1982), such that postvocalic /r/ in words such as <b>car,</b> <b>card,</b> and better are realized with some kind of articulated rhotic consonant (approximant, tap, and exceptionally a trill). This paper presents historical and more recent sociophonetic data from the Central Belt of Scotland (from Edinburgh to Glasgow), which show auditory/impressionistic, acoustic, and articulatory evidence of derhoticisation (e. g. Stuart-Smith 2003; Stuart-Smith et al 2007; Lawson et al 2011 a; Lawson et al 2011). Derhoticisation is especially evident in working-class speakers, whilst middle-class speakers are developing auditorily 'stronger' rhotics and merging vowels before /r/. We consider the geographical and social distribution of the rhotic-derhotic continuum in these varieties and the linguistic and sociolinguistic factors involved, and the evidence to date that exists from speech perception and social evaluation of speech. We conclude by considering how sociophonological detail and abstraction are encoded in mental representations (cf e. g. Johnson 2006) ...|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the main game, players are dealt four train <b>car</b> <b>cards</b> as their playing hand.

The player must keep at least two of these destination cards and discard unwanted tickets {{to the bottom of the}} stack, if any. Once kept, a destination ticket may not be discarded for the rest of the game. Each player also selects a group of 45 colored train pieces with a matching scoring marker.|$|R
50|$|Each {{player is}} also given three Train Stations, which allow {{a player to}} {{sacrifice}} points to use a route already claimed by another player.
