5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1993, the Swiss Confederation {{commissioned}} the BLS to provide a “piggyback” corridor along its line for road vehicles with a width of 2.5 m and a <b>corner</b> <b>height</b> of 4 m. The construction work began in January 1994 and the opening was delayed, due to geological problems on the southern side of the Simplon, until 11 June 2001. Since opening, the [...] "rolling highway", the transportation of trucks by rail from Germany to Italy via Lötschberg, has made a considerable contribution towards transferring transit traffic from road to rail.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{a project to}} {{implement}} the rolling highway system of piggyback operations for transalpine freight on the Lötschberg-Simplon axis was implemented. Such operations were possible under the previous profile of the Simplon Tunnel, but capacity would have been heavily restricted because its height was too low to carry trucks at the permitted maximum <b>corner</b> <b>height</b> of four metres. The clearance in the tunnel was therefore increased by lowering the rail trackbed. This work began in 1995 and lasted eight years. At the same time, the tunnel vault was rehabilitated, while the drainage tunnel was rebuilt. A total of 200,000 m³ of rock was removed with pneumatic breakers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} complex visual tasks, such as position- and size-invariant shape {{recognition}} and navigation in the environment, can be tackled with simple architectures {{generated by a}} coevolutionary process of active vision and feature selection. Behavioral machines equipped with primitive vision systems and direct pathways between visual and motor neurons are evolved while they freely interact with their environments. We describe the application of this methodology in three sets of experiments, namely, shape discrimination, car driving, and robot navigation. We show that these systems develop sensitivity {{to a number of}} oriented, retinotopic, visual-feature-oriented edges, <b>corners,</b> <b>height,</b> and a behavioral repertoire to locate, bring, and keep these features in sensitive regions of the vision system...|$|R

50|$|The Swiss Federal Office of Transport {{has granted}} a permit for the {{construction}} of a new Bözberg railway tunnel, to parallel the existing one, at a cost of SFr 350m. The new tunnel will form part of a scheme to increase the loading gauge on the freight route between Basle and Chiasso via the new Gotthard Base Tunnel, and will be large enough to accommodate piggyback trains carrying road vehicles with a <b>corner</b> <b>height</b> of 4 m. It will have double tracks and will replace the existing tunnel, which will be converted into a service and rescue tunnel and linked to the new tunnel by five cross-shafts.

40|$|A novel hybrid finite-element/finite-volume {{numerical}} {{method is}} developed {{to determine the}} capillary rise of a liquid with a free surface (under surface tension and gravitational forces). The few known exact analytical solutions are used to verify the numerical computations and establish their accuracy {{for a range of}} liquid contact angles. The numerical method is then used to ascertain the limitations of a number of theoretical approximations to solutions for the capillary rise in the linearized limit, for special geometries such as plane walls, concentric cylinders and in a wedge of arbitrary included angle. The existence of a critical wedge angle for a given contact angle is verified. However, the effect of slight practical rounding of wedge corners dramatically reduces the theoretical <b>corner</b> <b>height.</b> © Oxford University Press 2005; all rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} for hybrid matching based on polynomial models is proposed. Polynomial {{plays a key}} role in matching process; while the Efficiency Index measures the accuracy of the matching result. Airborne laser and aerial photograph are two data sources for this study. Even those sources perform in different projections, one can be transformed to another projection based on purposed transformation model and finally represented in the same projection as parallel. Both manual and automatic functions were employed to assist and improve modes of gathering and increasing number of tie points. Apart from edges and <b>corners,</b> <b>height</b> constraint and buildings configuration are employed. By result of this study, it was found that an accuracy of matching at checked points, when polynomial transformation was executed, was 0. 99 of EI, and in the meantime the correlation (R 2) of resampling was about 0. 99. Furthermore, height constraint was very important when various height of buildings were involved. It was found that dense buildings area with homogeneous height gave the highest accuracy of matching when polynomial transformation was applied.
