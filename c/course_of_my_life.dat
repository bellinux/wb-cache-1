500|$|Former United States President John Quincy Adams, who at {{the time}} {{represented}} Massachusetts in Congress, backed Michigan's claim. In 1833, when Congress rejected Michigan's request for a convention, Adams summed up his opinion on the dispute: [...] "Never in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> have I known a controversy of which all the right was so clearly on one side and all the power so overwhelmingly on the other." ...|$|E

I can and will ask no less of myself. For this reason, I am resigning from the office of governor." ...|$|R

2500|$|Heath's autobiography, The <b>Course</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life,</b> {{appeared}} in 1998. According to his Daily Telegraph obituary this [...] "had involved dozens of researchers and writers (some {{of whom he}} never paid) over many years".|$|E
2500|$|In Canada, Lee's parents {{gave him}} a Jewish education, with a bar mitzvah at age 13. His father was a skilled musician, but died the year before from medical {{problems}} resulting from his imprisonment. This forced his mother to find outside work to support three children. Lee feels that not having parents at home during those years was probably a factor in his becoming a musician: [...] "It was a terrible blow that I lost him, but the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> changed because my mother couldn't control us." [...] He said that losing his father at such an early age made him aware of how [...] "quickly life can disappear", which inspired him from then on {{to get the most}} out of his life and music.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his speech}} Scientific and Religious Truth (1974) while {{accepting}} the Romano Guardini Prize, Heisenberg affirmed:"In {{the history of}} science, ever since the famous trial of Galileo, it has repeatedly been claimed that scientific truth cannot be reconciled with the religious interpretation of the world. Although I am now convinced that scientific truth is unassailable in its own field, I have never found it possible to dismiss the content of religious thinking as simply part of an outmoded phase in the consciousness of mankind, a part we shall {{have to give up}} from now on. Thus in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> I have repeatedly been compelled to ponder on the relationship of these two regions of thought, for I {{have never been able to}} doubt the reality of that to which they point." [...] (Heisenberg 1974, 213)"Where no guiding ideals are left to point the way, the scale of values disappears and with it the meaning of our deeds and sufferings, and at the end can lie only negation and despair.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{there is}} nothing like having these affairs over,' said Cadurcis; 'and to confess the truth, my dear Scrope, I should not much care if Monteagle were to {{despatch}} me to my fathers; for, in the whole <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> miserable <b>life,</b> and miserable, whatever the world may think, it has been, I never felt much more wretched than I have during the last four-and-twenty hours. By Jove! do you know I was going to leave England this morning, and I have ordered my horses, too.' ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the release}} of his 2000 album, When Somebody Loves You, Jackson {{reflected}} on the album on Arista's website:" [...] I guess the last album I made -- not the cover-song album, Under the Influence, but High Mileage was {{a little on the}} dark side. Laughs I love that album, but some of it's a little heavy. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> was a little dark at that time, and that's probably why it ended up that way. I guess this one reflects a little more of what I feel today. [...] " ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I cannot {{allow for}} my private failings {{to disrupt the}} people's work," [...] Spitzer {{said at a news}} conference in Manhattan. [...] "Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> public <b>life,</b> I have insisted – I believe {{correctly}} – that people take responsibility for their conduct. I can and will ask no less of myself. For this reason, I am resigning from the office of governor." [...] Spitzer's lieutenant governor, David Paterson, succeeded him as governor of New York State and served the remaining 2 3/4 years of Spitzer's four year term.|$|R

60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Nothing {{seems to}} make sense here. All I {{can tell you is}} that she was the most impenetrably stupid woman I have ever met in the whole <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't {{imagine how}} sorry I am to hear it," [...] she said. [...] "I don't know when, {{in the whole}} <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> I have met with such a {{delightful}} adventure or spent such a perfect morning!" ...|$|E

His affairs, like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson's hands. In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers. These are mere {{business}} relations, miss; there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like sentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> business <b>life,</b> just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere machine.

60|$|I cannot say, however, that Rupert Hardinge {{was ever}} a boy to give his father the delight that a studious, well-conducted, {{considerate}} and industrious child, has it so much {{in his power to}} yield to his parent. Of the two, I was much the best scholar, and had been pronounced by Mr. Hardinge fit to enter college, a twelvemonth before my mother died; though she declined sending me to Yale, the institution selected by my father, until my school-fellow was similarly prepared, it having been her intention to give the clergyman's son a thorough education, in furtherance of his father's views of bringing him up to the church. This delay, so well and kindly meant, had the effect of changing the whole <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> subsequent <b>life.</b>|$|R
60|$|Such was <b>my</b> notion <b>of</b> a pirate's life. I {{would kill}} nobody; the very sight <b>of</b> <b>my</b> black flag would be {{sufficient}} {{to put an end}} to all thought of resistance on the part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> victims, who would no more think of fighting me, than a fat bishop would have thought of lifting his hand against Robin Hood and his merry men; and I truly believe that I expected my conscience to have a great deal more to do in the way <b>of</b> approval <b>of</b> <b>my</b> actions, than it had found necessary in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> ordinary school-boy <b>life.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Crowder; [...] "you {{may think}} it amazing {{that a very}} {{ordinary}} remark should connect 'The Parents' Assistant' {{with the city of}} Babylon, but so it was.

6000|$|... "Thank you, my dear cousin, but I did {{not come}} to see your father, of whom I have seen plenty in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and shall doubtless see more; I came to see you, of whom I can never see enough." ...|$|E

'Oh!' she said, as she fervently kissed Valetta, 'it is {{the most}} {{delightful}} evening I ever spent in the whole <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> except at Lady Merrifield's Christmas-tree! And now to go home in a carriage! I never went in one since I can remember!' ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1853 Brahms went on {{a concert}} tour with Reményi. In late May the two visited the violinist and {{composer}} Joseph Joachim at Hanover. Brahms had earlier heard Joachim playing the solo part in Beethoven's violin concerto and been deeply impressed. Brahms played {{some of his own}} solo piano pieces for Joachim, who remembered fifty years later: [...] "Never in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> artist's <b>life</b> have I been more completely overwhelmed". This {{was the beginning of a}} friendship which was lifelong, albeit temporarily derailed when Brahms took the side of Joachim's wife in their divorce proceedings of 1883. Brahms also admired Joachim as a composer, and in 1856 they were to embark on a mutual training exercise to improve their skills in (in Brahms's words) [...] "double counterpoint, canons, fugues, preludes or whatever". Bozarth notes that [...] "products of Brahms's study of counterpoint and early music over the next few years included [...] "dance pieces, preludes and fugues for organ, and neo-Renaissance and neo-Baroque choral works." ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is a great}} {{pleasure}} to be able to honor Sandy Levinson, my very dear friend, who has done so many things for me in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> academic <b>life.</b> He discovered me, when I was an assistant professor toiling in the vineyards at the University of Missouri- Kansas City, and he and Scot Powe persuaded the members of the faculty at the University of Texas School of Law to bring me there, and give me a job, perhaps against their better judgment. He was incredibly generous to me during my years there, and since then. He took me under his wing, and I learned an enormous amount from him, so much so, that as I describe the themes of his work to you in this essay, it strikes me how much these same themes have also become central to my own work as well. That is the depth and significance of his influence...|$|R
50|$|Full Collapse was {{a record}} that changed the <b>course</b> and shape <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> We began touring for it in basements and VFW halls, continued, opening for bands like the Murder City Devils and Rival Schools and ended up as a {{full-time}} touring band meeting {{hundreds of thousands of}} people with whom we formed deep and lasting connections. Time passes and we embrace new music and different goals but, ten years later, Full Collapse continues to move people and for that we are very grateful. This tour is a celebration of those times and the end of a chapter in the life of Thursday.|$|R
60|$|I {{have had}} many a ducking in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> {{and in general}} cared little about it: but the {{accumulated}} horrors of that night, the death-like coldness of the place, the appalling darkness and the dismal sense of our forlorn condition, almost unmanned me.|$|E
60|$|We {{had one or}} two persons at home {{in great}} wretchedness to dinner. Lockhart's looks showed the misery he felt. I {{was not able to}} make any fight, and the evening went off as heavily as any I ever spent in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
60|$|LORD DARLINGTON. Don't say that, Duchess. As {{a wicked}} man I am a {{complete}} failure. Why, {{there are lots}} of people who say I have never really done anything wrong in the whole <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Of course they only say it behind my back.|$|E
60|$|In the {{relating}} what {{is already}} past <b>of</b> <b>my</b> story, {{this will be the}} more easily believed, when I shall add, that through all the variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me, I never had so much as one thought of it being the hand of God, or that it was a just punishment for my sin, my rebellious behaviour against my father, or my present sins, which were great; or so much as a punishment for the general <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> wicked <b>life.</b> When I was on the desperate expedition on the desert shores of Africa, I never had so much as one thought of what would become of me; or one wish to God to direct me whither I should go, or to keep me from the danger which apparently surrounded me, as well from voracious creatures as cruel savages: but I was merely thoughtless of a God, or a Providence, acted like a mere brute from the principles of nature, and by the dictates of common sense only, and indeed hardly that.|$|R
60|$|I {{ran through}} an Italian grammar {{on my way}} across the Atlantic, and from <b>my</b> {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> Latin, Spanish, and French, I soon had a reading acquaintance with the language. I had really {{wanted to go to}} Germany, that I might carry forward my studies in German literature, and I first applied for the consulate at Munich. The powers at Washington thought it quite the same thing to offer me Rome; but I found that the income of the Roman consulate would not give me a living, and I was forced to decline it. Then the President's private secretaries, Mr. John Nicolay and Mr. John Hay, who did not know me except as a young Westerner who had written poems in the Atlantic Monthly, asked me how I would like Venice, and promised that they would have the salary put up to a thousand a year, under the new law to embarrass privateers. It was really put up to fifteen hundred, and with this income assured me I went out to the city whose influence changed the whole <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> literary <b>life.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would be}} out of your element in England, Meinik. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> there will be very {{different}} from what it is here. I shall go away from home to business, every morning, and not get back until perhaps seven o' clock in the evening. As a consequence, there would be nothing for you to do for me, and we should see very little of each other. You know I should like to have you with me, and would do all that I could to make you comfortable; but I am sure that you would not like the life. Here you have always been on the move, and there is always something for you to do, and think of.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold your peace, fool! I {{tell you}} that your poor dwarfish spirit cannot measure the scope of mine. I tell thee I would have the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> a torrent--I am weary of easy achievements, and wish for obstacles, that I can sweep before my irresistible course." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have kept}} one secret in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I am a bashful man. Nobody would suppose it, nobody ever does suppose it, nobody ever did suppose it, but I am {{naturally}} a bashful man. This {{is the secret}} which I have never breathed until now.|$|E
60|$|In {{all these}} things I have not erred; neither have I acted or done {{anything}} in the whole <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> either {{in the service of}} her majesty or of her ministry, that any one can say has the least deviation from the strictest regard to the protestant succession, and to the laws and liberties of my country.|$|E
5000|$|... "Here, then, is {{the crucial}} {{question}} which we have been leading up to. Have we ever opened our door to Christ? Have we ever invited him in? This was exactly the question which I needed to have put to me. For, intellectually speaking, I had believed in Jesus all <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> {{on the other side}} of the door. I had regularly struggled to say my prayers through the key-hole. I had even pushed pennies under the door in a vain attempt to pacify him. I had been baptized, yes and confirmed as well. I went to church, read my Bible, had high ideals, and tried to be good and do good. But all the time, often without realising it, I was holding Christ at arm's length, and keeping him outside. I knew that to open the door might have momentous consequences. I am profoundly grateful to him for enabling me to open the door. Looking back now over more than fifty years, I realise that that simple step has changed the entire direction, <b>course</b> and quality <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b>|$|R
6000|$|July 14.—After two partial examinations, a {{thorough}} examination [...] <b>of</b> <b>my</b> throat (larynx versus pharynx) {{has been made}} to-day by Dr. [...] Semon {{in the presence of}} Sir A. Clark, and the result is rather [...] bigger than I had expected. It is, that I have a fair chance of [...] real recovery provided I keep silent almost like a Trappist, but [...] all treatment would be nugatory without this rest; that the other [...] alternative is nothing dangerous, but merely the constant passage [...] of the organ from bad to worse. He asked what demands the H. of C. [...] would make on me. I answered about three speeches of about five [...] minutes each, but he was not satisfied and wished me to get rid of [...] it altogether, which I must do, perhaps saying instead a word by [...] letter to some friend. Much time has almost of necessity been [...] lost, but I must be rigid for the future, and even then I shall be [...] well satisfied if I get back before winter to a natural use of the [...] voice in conversation. This imports a considerable change in the [...] <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> daily <b>life.</b> Here it is difficult to organise it [...] afresh. At Hawarden I can easily do it, but there I am at a [...] distance from the best aid.

But I was merely thoughtless of a God or a Providence, acted like a mere brute, from the principles of nature, and by the dictates of common sense only, and, indeed, hardly that. When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not the least thankfulness in my thoughts. When, again, I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning on this island, I was as far from remorse, or looking on it as a judgment. I only said to myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be always miserable.|$|R
