50|$|In an {{internal}} combustion engine, a choke valve modifies the air {{pressure in the}} intake manifold, thereby altering the ratio of fuel and air quantity entering the engine. <b>Choke</b> <b>valves</b> are generally used in naturally aspirated engines with carburetors to supply a richer fuel mixture when starting the engine.

This work demonstrates the effect of adjusting <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> sizes on thermodynamic parameters of fluid flowing in a vertical well. Our simulation results revealed optimum <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> sizes that could keep producing vertical wells away from Asphaltene precipitation. The results of this study were implemented on a well in Darquin Reservoir that had been experiencing asphaltene precipitation. Experimental analysis of reservoir fluid, Asphaltene tests and thermodynamic simulations of well column were carried out and the most appropriate size of <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> was determined.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{experimental}} study of robust ant-slug control strategies for riser systems. The main objective of this thesis {{was to develop a}} robust anti- slug control scheme to increase the stability of riser systems. Similar research has been done previously, but is repeated in this thesis using a new closed loop tuning method by Skogestad et al. [24]. Using this systematic approach ensures that the results from the different experiments are comparable. A number of experiments have been carried out using a small scale two phase flow riser loop. The robustness of the different control schemes was compared by slowly increasing the <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening (setpoint) of the closed loop system until instability was reached. Since the inflow is depended on the system pressure, the control scheme with highest robustness was the one which was stable at the largest <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening. Mainly, single loop control schemes were tested successfully. The general trend was that the best controllable variables, with respect to robustness, are measurements upstream the riser low point. The best control scheme was able to stabilize the riser system until a <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening of 27 %. Top side measurements were in general found to be difficult to use in anti-slug control schemes. Density measurements using an optical slug sensor was able to stabilize the riser system, but no tuning method could be implemented. Measuring the topside flow rate using a venture tube and a DP-cell installation was tested with no success. The equipment used in the experiments was oversized and resulted in no signal output. Since no systematic tuning method could be implemented to the topside control schemes, no cascade anti-slug schemes were tested. Inspired by the density valve action, a square wave signal was used as an input to the <b>choke</b> <b>valve.</b> The experiments proved that the riser system stability region was extended when using a square wave as input...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the best}} {{suggested}} solutions for prevention of severe-slugging flow conditions at offshore oilfields is the active control of the production <b>choke</b> <b>valve.</b> This thesis is a study of robust control solutions for stabilizing multiphase flow inside the riser systems; through S-riser experiments and OLGA simulations. ?Nonlinearity? as the important characteristic of slugging system poses some challenges for control. Focus of this thesis is on online tuning rules that take into account nonlinearity of the slugging system. The main objective has been to increase the stability of riser systems at higher levels of valve openings with more production rates. Similar {{research has been done}} previously, but is repeated in this thesis using new systematic tuning methods. Three different tuning methods have been applied in this thesis. One is Shams?s set-point overshoot method developed by Shamsozzhoha (Shamsuzzoha and Skogestad 2010). The other is IMC- (Internal Model Control) based tuning method with respect to the identified model of the system from closed-loop step test. The last tuning method is simple PI tuning rules with gain scheduling for the whole operating range of the system considering the nonlinearity of the static gain. The two latter methods have been developed very recently by Jahanshahi and Skogestad (Jahanshahi and Skogestad 2013). Two series of experiments have been carried out using a medium-scale two-phase flow S-riser loop. A single loop control scheme with riser-base pressure as the measurement was used. The robustness of different tuning methods was compared by slowly decreasing the set-point of the closed-loop system, which was the inlet pressure, until instability was reached. The <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening was increasing gradually by decreasing the set-point. A control with a robust tuning method can maintain system stability in a large range of conditions. The <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> was then replaced with a quicker valve after the first set of experiments. The same experiments were repeated and the effect of control valve dynamics was investigated thereafter. The experiments were simulated in OLGA and the same control tests were performed. The OLGA case was constructed based on the first series of tests with valve 1 and the designed controllers with different tuning strategies were applied. Results of the experiments verified those of the simulations. The tuning method with the highest robustness was thus the one which could stabilize the system at the largest <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening (the lowest inlet pressure). The best tuning method, with respect to robustness is the simple PI tuning rules with gain scheduling for the whole operating range of the system. With this method, it was possible to stabilize the experimental riser system up to a <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening of 37 % from an open-loop stability of 16 %. It was also able to stabilize the simulated riser system until a <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening of 75 % from an open-loop stability of 26 %. Top side measurements were in general difficult to use in anti-slug control. Measurement of the topside density using a conductance probe installation was not successful. Therefore, no cascade anti-slug control schemes could be tested. </p...|$|R

50|$|The IsoGen turbine, with an {{electrical}} generator, captures the pressure energy released by pipelines when fluids flow downhill. When oil or gas travels downhill in a pipeline, it builds pressure, and pipelines use <b>choke</b> <b>valves</b> to release that excess pressure.

50|$|<b>Choke</b> <b>valves</b> are {{important}} for naturally-aspirated gasoline engines because small droplets of gasoline do not evaporate well within a cold engine. By restricting the flow of air into the throat of the carburetor, the choke valve reduces the pressure inside the throat, which causes a proportionally-greater amount of fuel to be pushed from the main jet into the combustion chamber during cold-running operation. Once the engine is warm (from combustion), opening the choke valve restores the carburetor to normal operation, supplying fuel and air in the correct stoichiometric ratio for clean, efficient combustion.|$|E
5000|$|In heavy {{industrial}} or {{fluid engineering}} contexts, a choke valve {{is a particular}} design of valve that raises and lowers a solid cylinder (called a [...] "plug" [...] or [...] "stem") which is placed around or inside another cylinder that has holes or slots. The design of a choke valve means fluids flowing through the cage are coming from all sides and that the streams of flow (through the holes or slots) collide with {{each other at the}} center of the cage cylinder, thereby dissipating the energy of the fluid through [...] "flow impingement". The main advantage of <b>choke</b> <b>valves</b> is that they can be designed to be totally linear in their flow rate.|$|E
40|$|When oil is {{produced}} under high water-cut conditions, oil in water emulsions can be formed. The break-up of oil droplets predominantly {{takes place in}} the <b>choke</b> <b>valve.</b> We have conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the effect of flow through a <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> on the oil-droplet-size distribution in the emulsion. In these experiments the choke is modeled as a circular orifice in a pipe. The droplet sizes after break-up can be correlated to the mean energy dissipation rate per unit mass in the orifice. The experiments have been conducted with two set-ups on a different scale. The relation, which we have derived for the maximum stable droplet diameter downstream of the orifice can be applied to both scales. Furthermore the effect of oil viscosity on the droplet sizes after break-up has been investigated.

40|$|For oil {{production}} under high water cut conditions the efforts needed for de-oiling {{of the production}} water are mainly determined by the oil-droplet-size distribution of this water. This distribution is predominantly the result of droplet breakup in the <b>choke</b> <b>valve.</b> To {{determine the effect of}} the <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> on the droplet-size distribution, we have conducted laboratory experiments in which we used a circular orifice in a circular pipe. With the help of theory on droplet break-up in turbulent flow and with knowledge of the flow field inside an orifice, a prediction of the distribution after break-up can be made. It is shown that the droplets increase in size with increasing oil viscosity and furthermore it appears that, for the description of the break-up process, the distribution of the turbulence over the orifice zone is an important factor.

40|$|In {{offshore}} production, the two-phase {{mixture of}} oil and gas is transported from the seabed oil wells to the surface facilities by pipelines and risers. The two-phase flow can have different flow regimes, where severe slugging is one undesirable flow regime and an effective solution is needed to prevent it. The recommended solution is active control of the top-side <b>choke</b> <b>valve.</b> Previously, controllability analysis is done of two-phase flow in a 4 -state pipeline-riser model. This analyze concludes {{that the best way to}} control the <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> is by using the subsea pressure measurement combined with topside flow measurement. However, the subsea pressure might be difficult to measure correctly because the pipeline is placed under tough conditions, hundredth or even thousands of meters under sea level.

50|$|In oil production, co-produced {{water is}} mixed with the oil in <b>choke</b> <b>valves</b> and process {{equipment}} producing water-in-oil emulsions. The amount of water increases during the production life of the reservoir. The emulsions are destabilized using gravitational separators, and the settling rates are increased by applying heat, demulsifiers, and AC electric fields. The AC electric field gives rise to attractive forces between water droplets and increases the probability of coalescence at contact. According to Stokes law, the settling rate increases proportionally with {{the square of the}} drop diameter. By promoting coalescence of small water droplets, the settling rate can be greatly increased. The water content is normally reduced to <0.5 vol% if this is the final treatment stage before the crude oil is exported.|$|E
30|$|Based on {{the local}} {{resistance}} computation model for a choke valve and using the flow characteristics of <b>choke</b> <b>valves,</b> we studied {{the relationships between the}} back pressure of a parallel choke assembly and the opening extent of <b>choke</b> <b>valves</b> and developed a model to characterize the pressure regime of the manifold assembly. A comparison of pressure characteristic curves shows that a parallel choke manifold assembly has obvious advantages over the conventional serial type including high linearity of pressure-regulating characteristics curves, the elimination of the overshoot interval, wider effective regulating interval and the higher system security. Laboratory hydraulic experiments have validated the capability of a back pressure control model for the parallel choke assembly to accurately control pressure. This study is of great theoretical and practical significance to further improve the performance of chokes used in managed pressure well drilling.|$|E
40|$|<b>Choke</b> <b>valves</b> {{are widely}} used in the oil&gas {{industry}} to control the fluid flowing in the system. Some of these valves rely on a "cage and sleeve" functioning, in which an outer, sliding sleeve controls the flow rate by overlapping the holes of an inner, fixed cage. The regulation characteristic of <b>choke</b> <b>valves</b> is typically quantified by the opening curve, which is {{the plot of the}} flow coefficient versus the valve opening. Experimental tests performed on a ???cage and sleeve??? choke valve revealed that the orientation of the holes of the cage affects significantly the flow coefficient. This work focuses on the worst situation encountered, in which an anomalous decreasing trend in the opening curve for large valve openings is accompanied by strong vibrations of the device. CFD simulations were run to provide a physical interpretation of this unexpected result. Due to the complexity of the flow field structure at the origin of this behavior particular attention was paid in properly defining the CFD model; the turbulence model and the differencing scheme for the convective fluxes were found to be the most significant parameters. The CFD runs allowed attributing the anomalous trend of the opening curve to the peculiar interactions of the jets within the cage. At last, a modification of the trim design is suggested for avoiding the malfunctioning of the valve and the abnormal vibrations...|$|E

40|$|The valve flow {{coefficient}} {{is commonly used}} as a parameter to assess the erosion state of <b>choke</b> <b>valves</b> in offshore oil platforms. In particular, {{the difference between the}} theoretical value of the valve {{flow coefficient}} and its actual value calculated during operation is retained as the valve health indicator. The actual valve flow coefficient is analytically calculated from the oil, water and gas mass flow rates. These quantities, which are allocated on a daily basis based on the measured total production from a number of wells, on physical parameters (pressures and temperatures) related to the specific well, and on a physical model of the process, can be affected by large uncertainties. Based on such values, the evaluation of the health indicator becomes unreliable and undermines the possibility of using it for prognostic purposes. Similar situations arise every time health monitoring rely on unreliable measurement taken by sensors subject to hard working condition, as often happen in the nuclear industry. This paper proposes a method to obtain more accurate daily estimates of the actual values of the oil, water and gas flow rates, from which improved estimates of the flow coefficient will follow. In this respect, an hybrid ensemble aggregating the physical model with data-driven models built using the Kernel Regression (KR) method has been used. Ensemble diversity is ensured by using different training sets;a local procedure based on the historical performance of the models is adopted to aggregate their predictions.

40|$|Oil and gas {{separators}} {{were one}} of the first pieces of production equipment {{to be used in the}} petroleum industry. The different stages of separation are completed using the following three principles: gravity, centrifugal force, and impingement. The sizes of the oil droplets, in the production water, are based mainly on the <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> pressure drop. The <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> pressure drop creates a shearing effect; this reduces the ability of the droplets to combine. One of the goals of oil separation is to reduce the shearing effect of the choke. Separators are conventionally designed based on initial flow rates; as a result, the separator is no longer able to accommodate totality of produced fluids. Changing fluid flow rates as well as emulsion viscosity effect separator design. The reduction in vessel performance results in recorded measurements that do not match actual production levels inducing doubt into any history matching process and distorting reservoir management programs.

40|$|Multiphase flow is {{associated}} with concurrent flow {{of more than one}} phase (gas-liquid, liquid-solid, or gas-liquid-solid) in a conduit. The simultaneous flow of these phases in a flow line, may initiate a slug flow in the pipeline. Hydrodynamic slug flow is an alternate or irregular flow with surges of liquid slug and gas pocket. This occurs when the velocity difference between the gas flow rate and liquid flow rate is high enough resulting in an unstable hydrodynamic behaviour usually caused by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Active feedback control technology, though found effective for the control of severe slugs, has not been studied for hydrodynamic slug mitigation in the literature. This work extends active feedback control application for mitigating hydrodynamic slug problem to enhance oil production and recovery. Active feedback Proportional-Integral (PI) control strategy based on measurement of pressure at the riser base as controlled variable with topside choking as manipulated variable was investigated through Olga simulation in this project. A control system that uses the topside <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> to keep the pressure at the riser base at or below the average pressure in the riser slug cycle has been implemented.
