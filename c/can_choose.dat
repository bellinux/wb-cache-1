40|$|AbstractIt {{is known}} that any square matrix A over any field is {{congruent}} to its transpose: AT=STAS for some nonsingular S; moreover, S <b>can</b> be <b>chosen</b> such that S 2 =I, that is, S <b>can</b> be <b>chosen</b> to be involutory. We show that A and AT are ∗congruent over any field F of characteristic not two with involution a↦ā (the involution can be the identity) : AT=STAS for some nonsingular S; moreover, S <b>can</b> be <b>chosen</b> such that SS=I, that is, S <b>can</b> be <b>chosen</b> to be coninvolutory. The short and simple proof is based on Sergeichuk's canonical form for ∗congruence [Math. USSR, Izvestiya 31 (3) (1988) 481]. It follows that any matrix A over F can be represented as A=EB, in which E is coninvolutory and B is symmetric...|$|R
