50|$|As {{it turns}} out, the chroma {{amplitude}} (when considered {{together with the}} Y signal) represents the approximate saturation of a color, and the <b>chroma</b> <b>phase</b> against the subcarrier as reference, approximately represents the hue of the color. For particular test colors found in the test color bar pattern, exact amplitudes and phases are sometimes defined for test and trouble shooting purposes only.|$|E
5000|$|Although, in {{response}} to changing U and V values, the <b>chroma</b> sinewave changes <b>phase</b> {{with respect to the}} subcarrier, it's not correct to say that the subcarrier is simply [...] "phase modulated". That is because a single sine wave U test signal with QAM produces only one pair of sidebands, whereas real phase modulation under the same test conditions would produce multiple sets of sidebands occupying more frequency spectrum.|$|R
5000|$|Flat fields, {{a signal}} {{consisting}} {{of nothing but}} a specific color (typically white, black, a shade of gray, {{or one of the}} primary colors (red, green, and blue) at maximum saturation). A red field is especially important in PAL applications, as it is the [...] "red difference" [...] portion of the <b>chroma</b> signal whose <b>phase</b> alternates every line; the red field should appear as a solid block of color, with no visible [...] "bands" [...] going across the screen.|$|R
50|$|Before {{encoding}} {{video to}} MPEG-1, the color-space is transformed to Y'CbCr (Y'=Luma, Cb=Chroma Blue, Cr=Chroma Red). Luma (brightness, resolution) is stored separately from <b>chroma</b> (color, hue, <b>phase)</b> and even further separated into {{red and blue}} components. The chroma is also subsampled to 4:2:0, meaning it is reduced by one half vertically and one half horizontally, to just one quarter {{the resolution of the}} video.This software algorithm also has analogies in hardware, such as the output from a Bayer pattern filter, common in digital colour cameras.|$|R
