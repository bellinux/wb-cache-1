The areal, layerwise ablation process is separated into its elements which are represented by intersection zones between single and multiple laser vectors. Thus two mechanisms of roughness formation are identified and described by model functions.

In case of turning, unbroken chips pose a major hindrance during operation and hence appropriate control of the chip shape becomes a very important task for maintaining reliable machining process. The continuous chip generated during turning operation deteriorates the workpiece precision and causes safety hazards for the operator. In particular, effective chip control is necessary for a CNC machine or automatic production system because any failure in chip control can cause the lowering in productivity and the worsening in operation due to frequent stop. Chip control in turning is difficult in the case of mild steel because chips are continuous. Thus the development of a <b>chip</b> <b>breaker</b> for mild steel is an important subject for the automation of turning operations. In this study, the role of different parameters like speed, feed and depth of cut and <b>chip</b> <b>breaker</b> height and width are studied. Response surface methodology was used to analyze the relationship between several explanatory variables and one or more response variables. The chips obtained were found to have greater thickness at low feed and depth of cut, and gradually decreased as feed and depth of cut increases. From the analysis of chip reduction coefficient ξ, lead to the conclusion that cutting speed and depth of cut are most significant factors along with their higher order terms. ...|$|E

In this study chip characteristics were tested for changing tool flank wear values. Response surface methodology was used to analyze the relationship between several explanatory variables and two predecided response variables.

The analysis lead to the conclusion that cutting speed and depth of cut are the most significant factors along with their higher order terms and interactions between variables...|$|E

For the tests, the used tool was a noncoated carbide tool (TNMA 160412) without <b>chip</b> <b>breaker.</b> The cutting material is a chrome molybdenum alloy type (ASI 4140). The cylindrical test tubes have a diameter of 120 mm and a length of 30 mm. For the first time, we present an analysis of forces and moments for different depths of cut and different feed rates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As {{machining}} technology develops toward the unmanned and automated system, {{the prediction of}} chip breaking is considered increasingly important, especially in continuous machining such as in cutting aluminum alloys. In this paper, chip breakers with different parameters are designed to produce chips that can be evacuated easily and reliably from the working zone. The formulation of chip up-curl radius is constructed through analyzing the chips subject to <b>chip</b> <b>breaker.</b> The predictive model of chip breaking is developed based on chip breaking conditions. Chip breaking strain is obtained by using backward-deducing method and cutting experiments. In order to verify the model, PCD tools with chip breakers are used to cut LY 12, chip breaking areas are compared with those obtained from the predictive model. Results show the chip breaking predictive model is reasonable...|$|E
