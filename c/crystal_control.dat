Comparisons with stability measure-ments made on <b>crystal</b> <b>controlled</b> oscillators indicate that noise in the electronics of the oscillators very seriously degrades the inherent stability of the quartz resonators for times less than 1 s. A simple model appears to describe the noise mechanism in <b>crystal</b> <b>controlled</b> oscillators and points the way to design changes which should im-prove theu short-term stability by two orders of magnitude. Calcula-tions are outlined which show that with this improved short-term stability it should be feasible to multiply a <b>crystal</b> <b>controlled</b> source to 1 THz and obtain a linewidth of less than 1 Hz.

5000|$|These motors are {{relatively}} costly, {{and are used}} where exact speed (assuming an exact-frequency AC source) as well as rotation with a very small amount of fast variations in speed (called 'flutter" [...] in audio recordings) is essential. Applications included tape recorder capstan drives (the motor shaft could be the capstan), and, {{before the advent of}} <b>crystal</b> <b>control,</b> motion picture cameras and recorders. Their distinguishing feature is their rotor, which is a smooth cylinder of a magnetic alloy that stays magnetized, but can be demagnetized fairly easily as well as re-magnetized with poles in a new location. Hysteresis refers to how the magnetic flux in the metal lags behind the external magnetizing force; for instance, to demagnetize such a material, one could apply a magnetizing field of opposite polarity to that which originally magnetized the material. These motors have a stator like those of capacitor-run squirrel-cage induction motors. On startup, when slip decreases sufficiently, the rotor becomes magnetized by the stator's field, and the poles stay in place. The motor then runs at synchronous speed as if the rotor were a permanent magnet. When stopped and restarted, the poles are likely to form at different locations. For a given design, torque at synchronous speed is only relatively modest, and the motor can run at below synchronous speed. In simple words, it is lagging magnetic field behind magnetic flux.|$|E

50|$|The {{station was}} started in 1923 by the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with a call sign of 9CC on an {{experimental}} basis until 1928. Regular daytime transmission began under the callsign of VE9OB in January 1929 on a wavelength of 40.8 metres (about 7.353 MHz). Continuous transmission at 90 metres began {{at the end of}} 1929, with other wavelengths being used experimentally. Time signals were generated from the observatory's own pendulum clocks. The transmitter oscillators were condenser-tuned and so frequency stability was not high until quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>control</b> was implemented in 1933. In 1938 the call was changed to CHU, operating on frequencies of 3.33, 7.335 and 14.670 MHz, at a transmitter power of only 10 W. The 1,000 Hz tone imposed on the carrier was derived from the quartz oscillator that determined transmit frequency, but the seconds pulses were still derived from the observatory pendulum clocks. The station automatically sent its call sign in Morse code once per hour, and pulses were coded to identify the time of day. Since the CHU power was not high enough to cover much of Canada, including survey parties working in the North, observatory time signals were also transmitted by a Department of Transport station with 2 kW power. In 1947 three new transmitters with 300 W power were installed for the three frequencies. In 1951, a Collins transmitter rated for 3 kW was put in service on 7.335 MHz.|$|E
