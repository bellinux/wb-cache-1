2500|$|Albini's lyrics drew {{criticism}} for apparent racism and homophobia. Racism {{was a frequent}} theme in Big Black songs, influenced partly by the sharp racial divisions present in Chicago at the time. The word [...] "darkie" [...] appeared in {{the first line of}} the Lungs EP, but Albini defended its use as a comical term, saying [...] "in a way that's a play on the concept of a hateful word. Can a word that's so inherently hilarious be hateful? I don't know." [...] He similarly defended his use of gay jokes and the word [...] "fag": [...] "Given how intermingled the gay and punk subcultures were, it was assumed by anyone involved that open-mindedness, if not free-form experimentation, was the norm. With that assumption under your belt, joke all you like. The word 'fag' isn't just a gay term, it's funny on its own — phonetically — like the words 'hockey puck,' 'mukluks,' 'gefilte fish,' and 'Canada. Some critics viewed these defenses as mere justifications for actual deep-seated racism, homophobia, and misogyny on Albini's part, given his level of familiarity with the subject matter, but he insisted that he was not a prejudiced person and was merely satirizing those impulses that rational, civilized persons normally suppress in the course of social interaction: [...] "So once that's given, once you know what you think, there's no reason to be ginger about what you say. A lot of people, they're very careful not to say things that might offend certain people or do anything that might be misinterpreted.

40|$|The {{questions}} about 'why radical innovations in the agri-food domain are needed' and 'how one {{can develop a}} realistic innovation strategy', next to a strong support of fundamental science projects, are today largely debated. First, the translation of societal challenges and trends into research & innovation strategies is not straightforward. Herein, {{the understanding of the}} innovation funnel is important, i. e. on one side numerous marketing opportunities are existing and on the other a long list of scientific ideas are created of which only a few pass the funnel. The ones passing the funnel are depending on various factors among which the full spectrum of competences of a team. Hence for all individuals, recognizing and respecting complementary competences of other participants is crucial. Next, the transition from science to impact versus impact to science requires another mind-set. The first starts with what you know; the second with understanding the outside world via posing questions. It also <b>changes</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> are organizing your project, from a business case towards a full research-innovation action plan with appropriate investment funds and common goals.

40|$|Virtual tourism {{has been}} through at least three {{generation}}s. The first is a special form of e-commerce, and no doubt it has much <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> plan your travel. Second generation of virtual tourism has exploited georeference: the user can know the services offered nearby and, with appropriate apps and augmented reality, receive information about places. An important contribution {{has been made in}} this field by social media (see Flickr, as well as Tripadvisor). The third generation of virtual tourism even replaces the travel experience: first proposing visits in virtual worlds, then in the real world. That allows tourism to social classes that are excluded. The goal is to send in the real place an "avatar", that can perform what tourist wants. Some experiments have been recently performed with robots, here a visit by drones is proposed. In particular, indoor visits are difficult because it is necessary to re-create a microgeodetic reference system in a closed and confined environment, to allow remote control and to ensure the protection of the cultural property. It has also to be considered the issue {{of the size of the}} drone, its autonomy and shooting video (which must be 360 degrees and high definition). The real experience is irreplaceable, but this form of tourism can find many interesting applications and strengthen real tourism. In conclusion, we believe that not only this performances are now within the reach of our technical capabilities, but  they also represent an effective response to certain social and cultural issues.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Time doesn’t {{wait for}} anyone. It always <b>changes</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> look at {{something}}, or <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it looks. This is something I {{learned from a}} young age, and have tried to battle against {{it in order to}} preserve memories I’ve made. I started out collecting family photos, then I moved on to taking my own, but as I got older I realized there is no real way to preserve a memory, it’s always changing. As years pass little moments are forgotten even physical relics from the past deteriorate and age with you. Because of this, I soon realized there’s no pure way to stay connected and felt saddened when looking back. It was like a layer of separation was formed between me and the memories. It’s a longing to connect to something, some person, some memory that is no longer present. This is what I’m interested in, the layer of separation felt from the past after time takes its course. Since my work is inspired by my memories, I use photographs from my childhood, furniture to amplify the imagery of the home, fabrics and other relics from my past. By using materials strongly tied to my past the work becomes a reproduction of my memories. I create artificial stand-ins for things I’ve experienced like… love/loss/home/joy/death/dissociation/bliss/pride/nostalgia/want/grief/playfulness/ innocence/depression/comfort/intimacy/longing/freedom/security/hope/peace/ through installations set up to allude to the image of home. In doing this a weird inbetween atmosphere is created as the work resembles something familiar, something that could be found in a home, but each piece is altered in a way so that it doesn’t just mimic a home. This could be through the use of sound, video, or lighting to distort <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> piece is viewed. This alter in reality helps to amplify the separation felt when trying {{to hold on to the}} past. By doing this I hope I can recreate this feeling. I hope the person viewing it might connect to this and reflect on their personal experiences. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Music {{making and}} {{technological}} development {{has always been}} connected. The digital revolution has made advanced music production, writing and distribution tools universally accessible. New intelligent tools built on machine learning are entering the market potentially changing how we create music and interact with creative content.   The aim of this thesis project has been to find alternatives to existing interaction models manifested in modern DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations). Ideas developed through rough sketches and simple prototypes—the outcome consists of three concept videos proposing changes to three moments in the workflow of songwriters and producers. This thesis started with an idea of exploring the borderland between computer generated music and human creativity. Through desk research and interviews I learned that computational creativity exist {{and that there is}} a lot of different ways of defining creativity and art. Creating creative computers should not aim to replace humans creative abilities—it is rather about automating and creating tools that enhance our creative abilities.   To understand how songwriters and producers work the subject were investigated through semi-structured contextual interviews. <b>The</b> different <b>ways</b> of working and using tools were mapped out and potential opportunity areas were identified. This thesis have been a project that through sketching, mock-ups and simple prototypes questions how we use digital tools in music production. These concepts and sketches were continuously brought back to experts for feedback. The outcome consists of three concepts. They are presented through three short videos. These videos are now shared with a bigger audience and will act as an conversation starter for people interested in tools for digital music production.   1. Automating parts of the songwriting process and create a collaborative workflow between a you and a computer, through a conversational user interface.   2. A pressure sensitive touch surface that let you manipulate sound. It is an adaptive system that automatically detects active controls in your DAW—it maps these active controls from your computer screen down to a touch pad.   3. <b>The</b> third concept <b>changes</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> organise and look for sound files.
