Graham saw the aperture of the ventilator with ghostly snow whirling above it and dark figures moving hastily. Three knelt on the fan. Some dim thing--a ladder was being lowered through the opening, and a hand appeared holding a fitful yellow light.|$|R
50|$|With clear {{windows on}} all four sides, the cathedral is flooded with light {{at any time of}} the day. This, {{together}} with the white walls and stone floor, combines to give a translucent effect which uplifts the spirit and conveys its own sense of the presence of God. The cathedral is lit by brass English Classical chandeliers (one of which was formerly in the church at Epping) and, above the <b>cornice,</b> concealed <b>lighting.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is a vaulted ceiling 65 ft high. Beneath {{the vault}} is an entablature whose <b>cornice</b> hides {{indirect}} <b>lighting</b> which illuminates and reflects off the ceiling. There {{is also a}} catwalk where the vault of the ceiling meets {{the top of the}} walls. The total enclosed volume is over , which gives a reverberation time of 4 seconds when the hall is empty.|$|R
5000|$|Ryan was {{in charge}} of {{lighting}} for the New York Hudson-Fulton Celebration of 1909, and for this lighted up all the major buildings, East River bridges, public places, and some stretches of the coastline of Manhattan. He installed colored searchlights on the Singer Building. The tower was reportedly visible from 40 miles away, and made a great impression:What every one of the visitors paused to gaze at was the Singer Building tower ... The main building was dark and gloomy, but from its center sprang a terra-cotta shaft set off with pale green pilasters rising to a golden <b>cornice.</b> The <b>lights</b> which illuminated it could not be seen, but it glowed against the sky.|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} the New York Historic Districts Council {{replaced}} a rotted out <b>cornice</b> made of <b>light</b> gauge metal sheets with one composed of molded fiberglass. The new cornice projected {{from the top}} of the building in a stepped design, with ornamental blocks (dentrils) arranged in a prominent row. The original third floor arches were also rebuilt. The arches were lost in 1903, a year in which three floors were added to the structure.|$|R

5000|$|Meiser Drug Store is a {{historic}} building located in the West End of Davenport, Iowa, United States. It was built in 1888 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. [...] Amielius Meiser built this structure to house his drug store. He had previously operated an apothecary across the street, and he resided on the upper floors of both buildings. This building is noteworthy for the brick and metal <b>cornice</b> and the <b>light</b> colored stone used in the details.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper level}} {{contains}} ten bedrooms, some of original dimensions, some divided by hardboard partitions, reusing in places, original panelled doors. Original walls are rendered, several with <b>cornices</b> and <b>light</b> surrounds matching the ground level rooms. The fireplace {{in the southwest}} bedroom is painted. The adjoining small bedroom is an exception, having window joinery painted internally. A sitting area above the ground level vestibule has a corrugated iron ceiling and moulded cornice. The door, and sashes to floor level, leading on to the southern verandah, are not early. Earlier glazed panels are in place above. The eastern door from hallway to verandah is of timber and glazed panels, with twin-paned fanlight of yellow patterned glass, and side lights of blue, above green bubble glass. The verandah is floored with 4 inch 100mm shot edged boarding. The roof is unlined.|$|R
5000|$|Located on 9th Street between Market Street and [...] "C" [...] Court. The {{rectangular}} {{theater is}} 120 ft along 9th Street and 90 ft on Market Street and [...] "C" [...] Court. The Ninth Street front presents a trapezoid appearance as the street rises a full {{story from the}} east corner on [...] "C" [...] Court to the west corner on Market Street. Originally, three storefronts were located along 9th street with doors on the incline.The walls are patterned, buff-toned stucco with a muted backdrop for the classical decorative features. The decorative features are glazed, white terra cotta and applied around the main entrance. The roof above the auditorium is gabled and flat, abutting the parapets. It is brick and hollow clay tile construction with a steel truss roof system over the auditorium. Reinforced concrete beams support the proscenium arch and balcony.The main entrance is rounded at the northeast corner and sheathed in the terra cotta. The classical decorative features are concentrated around the entrance. Three arched openings form a semi-circular arcaded entry with a ticket window, a double leaf glass door, and terrazzo flooring and marble kickplating. A replicated three-part flower petal marquee projects out over the entranceway. The second story is enclosed and capped with decorative parapet with lighted finials. The fenestration on the upper facade of the turret-like corner mirrors the arcaded entry below and features three sets of segmented arch windows. The remainder of the primary facade is less ornamented. The stuccoed wall surface is divided into six bays along the length by terra cotta piers of classical design. The decorative terra cotta parapet extends the entire length with lighted finials where the piers abut the cornice line. Adjacent to the main entry, the upper story {{of the first three}} bays features fenestration and an ornamented <b>cornice.</b> <b>Lighted</b> finials smaller than the pier finials adorn the parapet. Storefronts occupied the first bays along the second level from the northwest corner. [...] The Market Street front has a replicated storefront on the corner and a stairwell from an emergency exit serving the auditorium below.|$|R

The design was {{reflective}} of [...] in the 1960s. The station featured a wide, sloping canopy over the glass entrance. The front façade was divided into the glassed area and an open brickwork lattice with alternating vertical and horizontal holes. The pylons of the platform hall, which sloped and widened near the top, were lined with light-colored marble. Above the posts were <b>cornices,</b> where the <b>lighting</b> fixtures were mounted. Tiled walls of black and white lined the track and the flooring was tiled with gray and red granite.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear of the}} {{building}} has been substantially altered, with {{only one of the}} original masonry two-storeyed toilet blocks remaining, and a large television studio and communication equipment have been added. Sections of the rear verandah remain as internal corridor, off which french doors with fanlights open. The rear of the site contains carparking. Internally, {{the building}} has been substantially altered. The entrance hall contains a carved cedar staircase with a twin return, two figurine lamps on the bottom balusters and leadlight sash windows at the landing. This space has a raised ceiling with plaster mouldings including a deep <b>cornice</b> with recessed <b>lighting,</b> laurel relief, ornamental ventilation panels and a centre glazed skylight, which no longer admits natural light.

5000|$|The W.T.S. White House and Carriage House are {{historic}} buildings located in Clarinda, Iowa, United States. White created his fortune {{as president of}} the Clarinda Poultry Butter and Egg Company. He hired local architect William W. Welch to design his house. It and the carriage house were completed in 1906, and White moved to Chicago the following year. He sold the property to A.U. and Agnes Hunt for $8,000. The house and carriage house were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. [...] Both structures are Colonial Revival in style. The 2½-story frame house features Tuscan columns on the front porch, dentil <b>cornice,</b> and diamond <b>lights</b> in the second floor windows. The two story carriage house measures 25 by 30 ft, and is located behind the main house. It originally housed a horse and buggy, and has been transformed into an automobile garage.|$|R
6000|$|... § X. Very often, in {{the farther}} {{treatment}} of the profiles e or f, another limb is added to their curve in order to join it to the upper or lower members of the cornice or capital. I do not consider this addition as forming another family of cornices, because the leading and effective part of the curve is in these, as in the others, the single ogee; and the added bend is merely a less abrupt termination of it above or below: still this group is of so great importance in the richer kinds of ornamentation that we must have it sufficiently represented. We shall obtain a type of it by merely continuing {{the line of the}} Matterhorn side, of which before we took only a fragment. The entire line e to g on Plate VII., is evidently composed of three curves of unequal lengths, which if we call the shortest 1, the intermediate one 2, and the longest 3, are there arranged in the order 1, 3, 2, counting upwards. But evidently we might also have had the arrangements 1, 2, 3, and 2, 1, 3, giving us three distinct lines, altogether independent of position, which being applied to one general dotted slope will each give four cornices, or twelve altogether. Of these the six most important are those which have the shortest curve convex: they are given in light relief from k to p, Plate XV., and, by turning the page upside down, the other six will be seen in dark relief, only the little upright bits of shadow at the bottom are not to be considered as parts of them, being only admitted in order to give the complete profile of the more important <b>cornices</b> in <b>light.</b>|$|R
