40|$|Commercially {{available}} computer-controlled SQUID electronics {{are usually}} delivered with software providing a basic user interface for adjustment of SQUID tuning parameters, such as bias current, flux offset, and feedback loop settings. However, {{in a research}} context it would often be useful {{to be able to}} modify this code and/or to have full control over all these parameters from researcher-written software. In the case of the STAR <b>Cryoelectronics</b> PCI/PFL family of SQUID control electronics, the supplied software contains modules for automatic tuning and noise characterization, but does not provide an interface for user code. On the other hand, the Magnicon SQUIDViewer software package includes a public application programming interface (API), but lacks auto-tuning and noise characterization features. To overcome these and other limitations, we are developing an "open-source" framework for controlling SQUID electronics which should provide maximal interoperability with user software, a unified user interface for electronics from different manufacturers, and a flexible platform for the rapid development of customized SQUID auto-tuning and other advanced features.

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in nanotechnology has stimulated interest in mesoscopic superconductors as components for quantum computing and <b>cryoelectronics.</b> The critical parameters for superconductivity (current and field) of a mesoscopic sample {{are determined by}} the pattern of vortices in it, which in turn is controlled by the symmetry imposed by the shape of the sample (see ref. 1 and references therein). Hitherto it has been unclear what happens when the number of vortices is not consistent with the natural symmetry. Here we show that additional vortex-antivortex pairs nucleate spontaneously so as to preserve the symmetry of the sample. For example, in a square with three vortices, the spontaneously generated pair, along with the original three vortices, distribute themselves so that the four vortices sit in the four corners, with the antivortex in the centre. The measured superconducting phase boundary (of superconducting transition temperature T-c versus magnetic field strength) is in very good agreement with the calculations, giving direct experimental evidence for these symmetry-induced vortex-antivortex pairs. Vortex entry into the sample is also changed: vortices enter a square in fours, with antivortices generated to preserve the imposed vorticity. The symmetry-induced nucleation of antivortices is not restricted to superconductors, but should also apply to symmetrically confined superfluids and Bose-Einstein condensates. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of our developments {{in the fields of}} cryotechnology and <b>cryoelectronics</b> for managing biological samples stored over liquid nitrogen, fields that are essential to a central cryostorage facility for AIDS related material used in worldwide collaborative research. As a fundamental part of this project we have developed new electronic cryovials and carrier plates attached to Flash memory chips, so that a redundant and portable set of data is present with each sample. The recovery of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after cryopreservation in the new cryosubstrates showed, especially for small sample volumes (0. 1 ml), an increased viability in comparison to the preservation in standard cryovials. The electronic cryosubstrates interface with a dedicated laboratory workflow management system for reproducible and standardized sample processing. This system can read standard operating procedures (SOPs) stored on each sample's memory chip. Finally, we have developed a polymorphic cryoelectronic infrastructure for sample storage tanks. This cryoelectronic system has been integrated in a hermetic storage and semiautomatic handling environment. The new technologies provide state-of-the-art sample identification, documentation and tracking that brings added value to each sample. The first application of these technologies is in a worldwide collaborative research towards the production of an AIDS vaccine.

40|$|The major steps before {{utilizing}} high-Tc superconductivity in <b>cryoelectronics</b> are: 1. {{the fabrication}} {{of high quality}} thin films, 2. their patterning without degrading the thin film properties, 3. the microfabrication of Josephson junctions and the proof of their correct function, and 4. the demonstration of {{the applicability of the}} developed technology by realizing a complete cryoelectronic circuit. These four steps have been investigated under the guidance that the processes and methods to be employed are closely related to establish thin film techniques that have proven their value in conventional cryoelectronic technology. Thus a quick turn-over to industrial application may be possible. Under this spirit a novel sputter deposition technique has been developed involving a linear hollow cathode discharge that can be combined with an orthogonal substrate movement. Ar-plasma etching has been employed with good results for micropatterning of YBCO (typical etch rate 20 nm/min). Particularly the potential of both methods to be scaled up to large area processing exploiting only standard technologies makes them highly attractive. Step-edge junctions have been developed with a good yield utilizing only standard technologies (foto resist masks, Ar-plasma etching for step fabrication). To demonstrate the maturity of these developments a simple cryoelectronic circuit for a realistic practical application has been designed, fabricated and tested. On the level of single layer technolgy a YBCO-dc-SQUID planar gradiometer device working at 77 K has been realized that is already more sensitive than commercial non-superconducting magnetometers (gradient noise level 2. 2 nT/m/sqrtHz).

40|$|Micro-Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (μ-SMES) {{technology}} {{has emerged as}} a method for mitigating voltage sags for smaller scale applications using energy storage capacities of less than 100 kJ. These units are designed to mitigate low frequency (3 ̆c 1 kHz) voltage sags in power distribution systems extending the lifetime of electronic loads by reducing voltage fluctuations and reducing load outages due to under-voltage trips. Improvements in cryogenic and switching technologies indicates that μ-SMES are becoming a competitive alternative to other medium voltage sag mitigation devices such as Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) in terms of both efficiency, reliability and economics. This thesis details the work performed in the design, implementation and testing of a prototype High transition Temperature Superconductor (HTS) SMES device. The design and construction of the prototype includes development of the energy storage medium, cooling system and the Power Conditioning Circuit (PCC). The energy storage medium for the SMES prototype is designed using theoretical and Finite Element Modelling (FEM) tools and the initial design fabricated using HTS BSCCO- 2223 tape manufactured by Australian Superconductors. The refrigeration system to cool the HTS coil comprises of a gaseous helium cold head cryocooler used to maintain the coil at a temperature of 30 K, via the onduction cooling method, with a maximum heat load of 25 W when mounted in the prototype vacuum sealed cryostat. This design improves the Ic characteristic of the coil compared to that at 77 K by a factor of 4. 7, and hence improves the energy storage by a factor of 22. The prototype SMES PCC is capable of supplying a three phase load, accurately maintaining the current flowing in the energy storage medium during the steady state and reacting almost instantaneously to deliver energy to the load during voltage sags; successfully maintaining the load voltage at a specified level. The PCC has been constructed {{as a part of the}} process of developing a larger 20 kJ system aimed at industrial applications, with reference to a particular power quality study performed that represents the typical application. Further, to improve the efficiency of μ-SMES systems, an in-depth investigation into incorporating alternative switching technologies, such as <b>cryoelectronics</b> and Persistent Mode Current Switches (PMCS), into various size μ-SMES systems is presented...|$|E
