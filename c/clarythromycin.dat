40|$|Introduction: Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) root, {{a member}} of the pea family has been used since ancient times as both food and medicine. Licorice has been used as an antioxidant, {{antimicrobial}} and anti inflammatory in researches. Extraction of this medical plant is used as the basis of anti-ulcer medicine for treatment of peptic ulcer. Patients and Methods: In the present study, licorice decoction (20 gr/dl, 33 gr/dl) was prepared and anti microbial activity on helicobacter pylori growth was studied by disk diffusion method and cup plate method. Results: The results showed that licorice decoction 33 gr/dl by disk diffusion method inhibited growth of helicobacter pylori in vitro the same as metronidazole. (P value= 0. 709) However, it does not have anti bacterial activity against helicobacter pylori like amoxicillin and <b>clarythromycin</b> (Pvalue~ 0. 000). Conclusion: Decoction licorice (20 gr/dl, 33 gr/dl) can not be used as an alternative to choice antibiotics (amoxicillin, <b>clarythromycin)</b> in vitro...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTSeventy one {{patients}} were enrolled to an opened, comparative and randomized study to evalute {{the safety and}} efficacy of azitbromycin administered during 3 days versus clarithromycin during 10 days in the out treatment of lower respiratory tract infections. Azithromycin was given 500 mg once daily and clarithromycin 250 mg twice daily. A total of 51 patients (25 to azithromycin and 26 to <b>clarythromycin)</b> were eligible for efficacy assessment. Mean age was 42. 3 years (19 - 25), 29 (57 %) {{patients were}} male and diagnosis were the following: 40 (78 %) exacerbations of COPD and 11 (22 %) pneumonia. Both groups were similar in terms obasic details. Clinical success or improvement on final evaluation was noted in 92 % of patients in the azithromycin group and in 85 % in the claritbromycin group. There were no clinical failures on the azithromycin group and there were 3 on the clarithromycin group (on one of these patients there was a superinfection with E. coil). Safety was assessed in all patients randomized to the treatment groups (71 patients; 40 received azitbromycin and 31 received <b>clarythromycin).</b> One azitbromycin treated patient with lung cancer died with fulminating haemoptysis {{on the second day}} of treatment which was norelated to the study drug. Adverse events were reported in 3 patients all treated with <b>clarythromycin.</b> Regarding laboratory values there was an hematologic change related with infection resolution (leucocytes and neutrophils reduction and limphocytes increase) and there was no significant chemistry changes. Thirteen patients (8 of azithromycin group and 5 of clarithromycin group) showed laboratory abnormalities with no attributable clinical significance. In conclusion, Ibis study showed a high effectiveness of both azithromycin and clarithromycin in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections. The study was inconclusive about the superiority of one drug over the other. REV PORT PNEUMOL 1999; V (2) : 216 - 22...|$|E
40|$|A {{cell culture}} {{technique}} {{was used to}} test the in-vitro susceptibility of the type strain of Chlamydia pneumoniae to 23 antibiotics including macrolides, tetracyclines and quinolones. The activity of the antibiotics tested was similar to previous findings with C. trachomatis. <b>Clarythromycin</b> had the lowest MIC overall (0 - 007 mg/ 1). Other macrolides were found to have similar MICs to erythromycin (0 ̂ 36 mg/ 1). Both the macrolides and the tetracyclines were more active than the quinolones. It is proposed that the tetracyclines and erythromycin should be the drugs of choice for treating infections with C. pneumoniae; however several other antibiotics need to be evaluated...|$|E

40|$|Background & Objectives:  Helicobacter pylori (Hp) {{is related}} to gastritis, gastric ulcer, {{duodenal}} ulcer, and mucosal carcinoma. Emergence of multidrug resistant Hp strains encouraged the researchers to find new effective drugs. Especially medicinal herbs and plants which usually shows less side effects. The {{aim of this study}} was in vitro assessment of anti Hp activity of total extract of Tribulus terrestris (T. terrestris Benzoxacin, a local Iranian medicinal plant and its fraction Benzoxacin. Methods : total aqueous extract of aerial parts of the plant was prepared and liquid extraction with petroleum ether was used to separate its components. LC/MS system proved the existence of Benzoxazine derivative in the water fraction and the third's fraction. Anti (Hp) effects of total extract and its third fraction were examined by cup plate method and using standard MacFarland. 50 biopsy samples of antrum were detected from patients who were endoscopic candidates in Milad and Fayazbakhsh  hospitals of Tehran during 2011. All samples were isolated, diagnosed based on standard methods and biochemical tests and confirmed by PCR method for ureC gene, too.   Different dilutions (250, 500, 750 and 1000 mg/ml) of total extract were prepared. <b>Clarythromycin</b> (Cl r) E-test strips and an identified Hp OC 1096 was used, simultaneously. Results: Of 50 biopsy samples, 12 Hp strains were isolated. Rapid urease test were positive in all expect one biopsy sample. Existence of ureC gene in all isolates were confirmed expect one strain by PCR. By cup plate method, resistant to concentrations of 1000 and 750 mg/ml were detected in 50 % of Hp isolates and 66. 6 % of them were resistant to concentrations 250 and 500 mg/ml. Also, 83. 3 % of Hp strains were resistant to Benzoxacin fraction. <b>Clarythromycin</b> sensitivity detected in 83 % of Hp isolates, simultaneously. Conclusion: This study was done as a pilot study for in vitro evaluation of antibacterial effect of total extract of T. terrestris by cup plate method. Existence of high resistant rate (≥ 50 %) to different concentrations T. terrestris aqueous extract seems doing test on more Hp strains  in future studies is highly  recommended.   In contrast of the similarity of Benzoxazin structure to Ofloxacin, existence of 83. 3 % of resistance among tested isolates showed no anti Hp effectiveness of this fraction.   </ul...|$|E
40|$|Validation of an {{analytical}} method {{is a necessary}} step in controlling the quality of quantitative analysis. Method validation is an established process which provides documentary evidence that a system fulfils its pre-defined specification, or shows that {{an analytical}} method is acceptable for its intended purpose. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to develop and validate analytical procedures for the quantitative determination in surface water of substances selected in the First Watch List. Two different methods were developed and validated: •	A multi-residual method based on SPE-LC-MS/MS analysis, using OASIS HLB as sorbent material for the extraction of 1 litre water samples and quantitative determination of EE 2, E 2, E 1, diclofenac, azithromycin, <b>clarythromycin,</b> methiocarb acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thiametoxam and oxadiazon. •	A multi-residual method based on LLE-GC-MS, using hexane as extraction solvent for the extraction of 0. 01 litre water samples and quantitative determination of BHT, EHMC and Triallate.

40|$|The {{potential}} of ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) for the screening and confirmation of antibiotics in water samples {{is illustrated in}} this paper. UHPLC presents several advantages over conventional liquid chromatography as it generates narrow peaks (increasing peak height and improving sensitivity) and reduces chromatographic runs. Regarding QTOF-MS, its increased mass resolution, high sensitivity in full-spectrum acquisition mode and mass accuracy, in both MS and MS/MS modes, make this technique ideal for the detection and reliable confirmation of organic contaminants in environmental samples. After a solid-phase extraction using Oasis HLB cartridges, UHPLC-QTOF-MS has been applied in this work to several types of water samples (surface water and influent and effluent wastewaters). Several antibiotics {{were found in the}} samples, such as ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, <b>clarythromycin</b> or erythromycin, among others. Moreover, the full spectrum data provided by TOF-MS acquisition has enabled searching for many other pharmaceuticals that could be present in the samples in a "post-target" way. This approach has allowed the detection and confirmation of paracetamol, omeprazole and codeine, among others. UPLC-QTOF-MS has been shown as an attractive and efficient hyphenated technique for the rapid detection and confirmation of pharmaceuticals in water with very little sample handling. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Objective: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) {{is a most}} {{frequent}} cause of invasive diseases such as meningitis, septic arthritis and pneumonia in children under 5 years old. Asymptomatic oropharyngeal colonization is an origin of distribution of microorganism to others and probable bacteremia in the same child. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine antibiotic susceptibility of Hib in Tehran day care centers. Material & Methods: Hib was isolated from oropharynx of 1000 children visiting 25 day care centers selected randomly in different parts of Tehran city during second half of year 2005. For antibiotic susceptibility determination we used disk diffusion test. Findings: Ampicillin resistance was 32. 3 % and Beta lactamase production was seen in 23. 6 %. Cephalosporins resistance except for cefixime was between 10 % to 20 % and in cefixime was 58. 8 %. Rifampin resistance was 17. 6 %. Resistance to studied macrolids including azythromycin and <b>clarythromycin</b> was 19. 6 % and 35. 3 %. Conclusion: On the base of high antibiotic resistance to Hib in our study and other similar studies in Iran, we recommend to use optimal effective and proper antibiotics to decrease the high rate of antibiotics resistance to Hib colonization and its invasive diseases...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the rate of Helicobacter pylori (HP) recurrence and duodenal ulcer relapse in patients of a hospital in Singapore {{over a period of}} at least one year from the time of eradication. Ninety-six consecutive duodenal ulcer patients with biopsy-proven HP eradication and healed ulcer were seen at 3 -month intervals, and follow-up endoscopy was performed when dyspepsia recurred, {{at the end of one}} year after eradication, or at the time of recall if the patient had been lost to follow-up. HP status was determined by antral and corpus biopsies and by antral cultures. Sixty-five had been given triple therapy, and 31 received dual therapy with omeprazole + amoxycillin or <b>clarythromycin.</b> Median time to follow-up endoscopy was 12 months. Six patients (6. 25 %) were positive for HP infection after eradication. Recurrence of HP infection was detected at 9 and 10 months after confirmation of HP eradication in two patients, and at between 13 and 20 months in the remaining four. Two of these had recurrent duodenal ulcer; all but one had erosive duodenitis. Two other patients had recurrent duodenal ulcer despite absence of HP reinfection; they admitted to taking low-dose aspirin. It was concluded that the recurrence of HP infection is low at the end of one year after successful eradication therapy in this urban East Asian population. Ulcer relapse occurred in 4. 17 % (4 / 96) of patients, and was associated with recurrent HP infection or NSAID exposure...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} a probiotic, Lactobacillus acidophilus LB (LB), or a synbiotic, Saccharomyces boulardii plus inulin (SbI), on Helicobacter pylori (Hp) colonization in children. Subjects and methods: A clinical trial was carried out in a school from a low socio-economic area of Santiago. Two hundred and fifty-four asymptomatic children (8. 40 +/- 1. 62 y) were screened for Hp by the C- 13 -Urea Breath Test (C- 13 -UBT). Hp-positive children were randomly distributed into three groups to receive either antibiotic treatment (lanzoprazole, <b>clarythromycin</b> and amoxicillin) for 8 cl, or SbI or LB daily for 8 wk. A second C- 13 -UBT was carried out at this time. Spontaneous clearance was evaluated in the same way in 81 infected, untreated children. The differences in the delta(13) CO(2) over baseline values before and after treatments (Delta DOB) were evaluated. Results: 182 subjects (71. 7 %) were colonized by Hp, and 141 of them completed their treatment (22. 5 % dropout). Hp was eradicated in 66 %, 12 % and 6. 5 % of the children from the Ab, SbI and LB groups, respectively, while no spontaneous clearance was observed in the children without treatment. A moderate but significant difference in Delta DOB was detected in children receiving living SbI (- 6. 3 1; 95 % CI: - 11. 84 to - 0. 79), but not in those receiving LB (+ 0. 70) - 95 % CI: - 5. 84 to +/- 7. 24). Conclusion: S. boulardii seems promising as an agent that interferes with Hp in colonized individuals. More studies are needed to confirm these results and to elucidate the mechanisms by which Sb inhibits Hp...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Viriato Study is a nationwide, prospective, multicenter {{surveillance}} {{study of}} the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens commonly associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Portugal. In 2003 and 2004 a total of 2945 isolates was recovered in the 29 laboratories that participated in the study. Testing was undertaken in a central laboratory. Of the 513 Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from patients with acute tonsillitis all were susceptible to penicillin and other beta-lactams but 18. 9 % were resistant to erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin. The M phenotype dominated (67 %), conferring resistance to erythromycin (MIC 90 = 16 mg/L), <b>clarythromycin</b> and azithromycin, but susceptibility to clindamycin (MIC 90 = 0. 094 mg/L). From patients with lower respiratory tract infection 1, 300 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 829 of Haemophilus influenzae, and 303 of Moraxella catarrhalis were studied. Among S. pneumoniae isolates 18. 4 % were resistant to penicillin (3. 5 % showing high-level resistance), 7. 1 % to cefuroxime, 0. 5 % to amoxicillin and amoxicillin/ clavulanate, 18. 8 % to erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin, 14. 9 % to tetracycline, 16. 5 % to co-trimoxazol, and 0. 4 % to levofloxacin. Beta-lactamases were produced by 10. 0 % of H. influenzae and 96. 4 % of M. catarrhalis. In H. influenzae resistance to clarithromycin was 5. 5 % and to cotrimoxazole was 13. 4 %. Most strains were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime, azithromycin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. In M. catarrhalis resistance to co-trimoxazole was 27. 1 % and to tetracycline 1. 0 %. All strains were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime, clarithromycin, azithromycin and ciprofloxacin. Penicillin was the most active antimicrobial agent against S. pyogenes and amoxycillin / clavulanate and the quinolones the most active in vitro simultaneously against S. pneumoniae, H. influenza and M. catarrhalis.
