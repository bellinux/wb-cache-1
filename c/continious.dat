40|$|In {{the thesis}} we present the {{calculation}} of deflections of reinforced concrete beams. We describe the factors that cause the deflections. These deflections can damage or disable {{the function of the}} construction in different ways. Rheology of concrete includes the influence of formation of deformations, due to shrinkage and creep. We take this into account with reduction of material parameters. We also emphasize the influence of cracking of reinforced concrete sections. The cracking influences the reduction of bending stiffness of the construction and consequently increased deformation. We present the most common criteria and problems which occur due to too much deflection of reinforced concrete constructions. With the help of self-made Excel program which computes the deflections of <b>continious</b> beams, we describe the procedure of calculating the deflections, simplification of the computation and accuracy of the computed deflection values. Standard SIST EN 1992 - 1 - 1 gives the ratios between static height and span where deflection computation is not even required.

As a rare karst and natural phenomenon, Homoljska Potajnica was a subject of interest for numerous researchers and geomorphologists in Serbia.
