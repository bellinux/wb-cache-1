25|$|The {{theory for}} this kind of {{avalanche}} transistor is described completely in the paper , which also shows that this semiconductor device structure is well suited for microwave power amplification. It can deliver several watts of radio frequency power at a frequency of several gigahertz and it also has a control terminal, the base. However, it is not widely used since it requires voltages exceeding 200 volts to work properly, while gallium arsenide or other <b>compound</b> <b>semiconductor</b> FETs deliver a similar performance while being easier to work with. A similar device structure, proposed more or less in the same period in the paper , was the IMPISTOR, being a transistor with IMPATT collector-base junction.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difference}} between the photon-emitting semiconductor laser and a conventional phonon-emitting (non-light-emitting) semiconductor junction diode lies {{in the type of}} semiconductor used, one whose physical and atomic structure confers the possibility for photon emission. These photon-emitting semiconductors are the so-called [...] "direct bandgap" [...] semiconductors. The properties of silicon and germanium, which are single-element semiconductors, have bandgaps that do not align in the way needed to allow photon emission and are not considered [...] "direct." [...] Other materials, the so-called compound semiconductors, have virtually identical crystalline structures as silicon or germanium but use alternating arrangements of two different atomic species in a checkerboard-like pattern to break the symmetry. The transition between the materials in the alternating pattern creates the critical [...] "direct bandgap" [...] property. Gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, gallium antimonide, and gallium nitride are all examples of <b>compound</b> <b>semiconductor</b> materials {{that can be used to}} create junction diodes that emit light.|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen and/or helium implantation-induced surface {{blistering}} and layer splitting in <b>compound</b> <b>semiconductors</b> such as InP, GaAs, GaN, AlN, and ZnO are discussed. The blistering phenomenon {{depends on}} many parameters {{such as the}} semiconductor material, ion fluence, ion energy, and implantation temperature. The optimum values of these parameters for <b>compound</b> <b>semiconductors</b> are presented. The blistering and splitting processes in silicon have been studied in detail, motivated by the fabrication of the widely used silicon-on-insulator wafers. Hence, {{a comparison of the}} blistering process in Si and <b>compound</b> <b>semiconductors</b> is also presented. This comparative study is technologically relevant since ion implantation-induced layer splitting combined with direct wafer bonding in principle allows the transfer of any type of semiconductor layer onto any foreign substrate of choice-the technique is known as the ion-cut or Smart-Cut (TM) method. For the aforementioned <b>compound</b> <b>semiconductors,</b> investigations regarding layer transfer using the ion-cut method are still in their infancy.
