6000|$|But {{even the}} {{break-up}} of 8,000,000 acres, {{though it may}} make us safe for food, will only increase our country population by 250,000 labourers and their families (a million souls)--a mere beginning towards the satisfaction of our need. We want in operation, before demobilisation begins, a great national plan {{for the creation of}} good small holdings run on co-operative lines. And to this end, why should not the suggestion of tithe redemption, thrown out by Mr. Prothero, on pages 399 and 400 of [...] "English Farming: Past and Present," [...] be adopted? The annual value of tithes is about £5,000,000. Their extinction should provide the Government with about 2,500,000 acres, enough at one stroke to put three or four hundred thousand soldiers on the land. The tithe-holders would get their money, landlords would not be prejudiced; the Government, by virtue of judicious choice and discretionary compulsion, would obtain the sort of land it wanted, and the land would be for ever free of a teasing and vexatious charge. The cost to the Government would be £100,000,000 (perhaps more) on the best security it could have. [...] "Present conditions," [...] I quote from the book, [...] "are favourable to such a transaction. The price of land enables owners to extinguish the rent charge by the surrender of a reasonable acreage, and the low price of Consols enables investors to obtain a larger interest for their money." [...] For those not familiar with this notion, the process, in brief, is this: The Government pays the tithe-holder the <b>capitalised</b> <b>value</b> of his tithe, and takes over from the landlord as much land as produces in net annual rent the amount of the tithe-rent charge, leaving the rest of his land tithe-free for ever. There are doubtless difficulties and objections, but so there must be to any comprehensive plan for obtaining an amount of land at all adequate. Time is of desperate importance in this matter. It is already dangerously late, but if the Government would turn-to now with a will, the situation could still be saved, and this unique chance for re-stocking our countryside would not be thrown away.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{literature}} in both the US (for example Haurin and Brasington 1996, and Black 1999) and the UK (for example Gibbons & Machin, 2003) that estimates {{the way in which}} school quality is capitalised into house prices. Cheshire and Sheppard 1995 and 1999 estimated hedonic models in which the quality of the secondary school to which a household was assigned was a significant variable which provided evidence that secondary school quality was being capitalised into the price of houses. In contrast Gibbons and Machin concluded that primary schools were more significant. Each of these analyses is predicated {{on the assumption that the}} value of local schools should be reflected in the value of houses. We argue here that this is rather too simple. We should expect variation in the capitalised price of a given school quality at either primary or secondary level according to the elasticity of supply of ‘school quality’ in the local market, the certainty with which that quality can be expected to be maintained over time and the suitability of the dwelling to accommodate children. These factors will vary systematically between and perhaps within cities. This paper explores the sources and the impact of such variations as well as the impact of model specification. The results provide new evidence on the complex and subtle ways in which housing markets <b>capitalise</b> the <b>value</b> of local public goods such as school quality and perhaps most importantly suggest that this is highly non-linear: houses in the catchment areas of only the best state schools command substantial premiums but such <b>capitalised</b> <b>values</b> can be very substantial indeed. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} simulation of property sales revealed {{that in a}} mildly optimistic market, auction prices returned premiums to the rational <b>capitalised</b> <b>values,</b> whereas tender sale did not. Results suggest that auction premiums may tend to peak near {{the middle of the}} auction, however, the properties were sold in order of diminishing value, so further research may be necessary in order to distinguish between these two factors. The paper relates the experiment to the developing literature on the behavioural study of property auctions that tends to use analysis of actual auctions. One advantage of the experimental environment is that unlike actual auctions, the rational value of the property can be perfectly visible to all subjects. The shortcoming of experimental simulations appears to be that subjects may be less risk conscious. The discussion raises several issues for future experimental design, including the manipulation of market sentiment and the sensitivity of the experimental situation to rewards and punishments in order to achieve external validity. The paper concludes with a summary of the usefulness of this type of property research and makes suggestions for its future direction.

40|$|Carbon {{sequestration}} {{has emerged}} as one of the only ecosystem services with a market that allows forest owners to capture the value of the service. However, since the focus of forest-based systems for sequestering carbon has largely been on creating permanent stores of carbon on defined areas of land and with a single initial payment to the forest owner for the carbon, this has limited participation of many forest owners in carbon markets. The reasons for this are twofold. The first is that the only forest owners who can realistically participate in current markets are those with a forest area that is sufficiently large to create an effectively permanent carbon pool while continuing production of timber or those who have chosen to stop harvesting. The second is that the payment system for carbon is generally based on matching a specific buyer and seller of carbon using a single payment to the forest owner. The combined effect of both of these factors is to create a carbon market that is too inflexible to attract anything but the largest land or forest owners. This paper presents an alternative carbon market – carbon banking. Carbon banking treats sequestered carbon in the same way that a financial institution treats capital, with forest owners ‘depositing ’ carbon in exchange for an annual payment, and those who need carbon offsets ‘borrowing ’ carbon by making an annual payment. The role of the carbon bank is to aggregate deposits of carbon and use these to meet various demands for carbon. The key benefits of this system are that it provides an opportunity for small forest owners with different types of forest, age classes and management strategies to participate in carbon markets because payments are based on current carbon sequestered. It also removes some uncertainty about locking into the wrong value for carbon by allowing participants in the carbon market to receive current value for carbon rather than what effectively represents the <b>capitalised</b> <b>value</b> of the future benefits of sequestering carbon...|$|E

40|$|Current UK lease {{accounting}} regulation {{does not}} require operating leases to be capitalised in the accounts of lessees, although {{this is likely to}} change with the publication of FRS 5. This study conducts a prospective analysis of the effects of such a change. The potential magnitude of the impact of lease capitalisation upon individual users' decisions, market valuations, company cash flows, and managers' behaviour can be indicated by the effect on key accounting ratios, which are employed in decision-making and in financial contracts. The <b>capitalised</b> <b>value</b> of operating leases is estimated using a method similar to that suggested by Imhoff, Lipe and Wright (1991), adapted for the UK accounting and tax environment, and developed to incorporate company-specific assumptions. Results for 1994 for a random sample of 300 listed UK companies show that, on average, the unrecorded long-term liability represented 39 % of reported long-term debt, while the unrecorded asset represented 6 % of total assets. Capitalisation had a significant impact (at the 1 % level) on six of the nine selected ratios (profit margin, return on assets, asset turnover, and three measures of gearing). Moreover, the Spearman rank correlation between each ratio before and after capitalisation revealed that the ranking of companies changed markedly for gearing measures in particular. There were significant inter-industry variations, with the services sector experiencing the greatest impact. An analysis of the impact of capitalisation over the five-year period from 1990 to 1994 showed that capitalisation had the greatest impact during the trough of the recession. Results were shown to be robust with respect to key assumptions of the capitalisation method. These findings contribute to the assessment of the economic consequences of a policy change requiring operating lease capitalisation. Significant changes in the magnitude of key accounting ratios and a major shift in company performance rankings suggest that interested parties' decisions and company cash flows are likely to be affected...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study aims to empirically {{investigate}} the mechanisms through which absorptive capacity (AC), trust and information systems jointly influence product innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes a research model {{to examine the}} mediating role of AC on the impacts of trust and information systems on product innovation and the moderating roles of trust and information systems {{on the relationship between}} AC and product innovation. The hypotheses are empirically tested using regression and bootstrapping methods and data collected from 276 manufacturing firms in China. Findings: This study finds that trust and information systems positively affect product innovation and the effects are fully mediated by AC. AC also significantly enhances product innovation and the effect is amplified by trust as well as information systems. In addition, the results show that trust and information systems improve AC both individually and interactively. Originality/value: The findings extend existing knowledge on the antecedents of AC and the contingent conditions under which a manufacturer’s AC is more effective than that of its rivals. The results also clarify the mechanisms through which trust and information systems improve product innovation. This study provides insights into the complex relationships among a manufacturer’s sociotechnical systems, knowledge management processes and new product development, and reveals how to design organisational systems to fully <b>capitalise</b> the <b>value</b> of AC on product innovation...|$|R

This paper seeks to highlight a current disconnect between physical activity and sport management research, and identify opportunities for collaboration. To date, the sport management literature has predominantly focused on sport {{as a form of}} entertainment with spectatorship outcomes, where professional codes are a commonly used setting of research inquiry. There has been less focus on organisational issues related to participation in sport and recreation. This is identified as a gap, given the current push towards increasing focus on sport and recreation promotion for community wellbeing. The present paper sought to examine physical activity and sport management research, to identify commonalities and potential for integration and co-operation. The outcome of this review is a conceptual framework, integrating socio-ecological models, taken from physical activity research, and sport development concepts derived from sport management theory. The proposed conceptual framework seeks to provide sport management researchers with direction in their efforts to promote participation in sport, recreation and physically active leisure domains, particularly for community wellbeing purposes. Furthermore, such direction may also enhance the capacity of researchers to capitalise on opportunities for collaboration and integration across domains of inquiry...|$|R
40|$|Accessibility is a {{fundamental}} concept in theories of metropolitan spatial structure. Urban economic models explain urban structure {{as a function of}} access to jobs; accessibility is <b>capitalised</b> into land <b>values,</b> which in turn explain the population distribution. Studies of residential land values show that many factors contribute to the value of a given location: the characteristics of the housing unit, its location with respect to social and environmental amenities, as well as access to jobs, services and other economic opportunities. Empirical studies typically use job access as a proxy for more generalised access to economic activities. However, jobs represent many different activities, from retail shopping to heavy manufacturing, and the value of access to these activities may be positive or negative. In this paper, accessibility measures based on industry sectors have been developed, allowing the separating out of possible different effects. Their impacts are tested on residential land values using data from the Los Angeles region. A multilevel modelling approach is used in order to control for neighbourhood-level attributes common to multiple properties. It is found that the various access measures have different and significant effects on land values, but attributes of the dwelling unit, together with access to the coast, explain most of the variation. The multilevel model is confirmed; there is significant correlation among properties within the same neighbourhood. ...|$|R

The author considers the day-to-day work of the classroom teacher by asking the questions: how can classroom teaching contribute to ensuring that schools and society does not produce 'clever devils' - such as those produced in the Holocaust? For a Christian school, how can reflection on Christian values be systematically promoted through classroom teaching? How can schools capitalise on the potential offered by 'values moments' - those time when questions of value and meaning force themselves through the academic content of the lesson to become {{the focal point of}} the pupils' attention? In order to illustrate how to develop an effective Christian value-added curriculum, the author discusses the Charis Project, which was set up in the wake of legislation in the UK that required schools to promote the spiritual and moral development of their pupils through the curriculum. He then suggests five practical actions for implementing a values-added approach to the curriculum in the Anglican school: (1) develop and <b>capitalise</b> on informal <b>values</b> moments; (2) be strategic in the values that are promoted; (3) plan the curriculum as a biblical 'fifth act' enterprise, which means being aware of the bigger story that the subject is promoting; (4) design teaching methods that promote reflection and response; (5) develop specific topics with a strong values base...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine current {{approaches}} to interpretation of student evaluation data and present an innovative approach to developing benchmark targets for the effective and efficient use of these data. Design/methodology/approach: This article discusses traditional approaches to gathering and using student feedback across the tertiary sector. The limitations of the customary use of the statistical mean as a quality measure of performance are presented and examined. An alternative method of interpreting student evaluation data is proposed and examples given. Findings: The traditional use of the statistical mean to interpret student evaluation data has limitations. Focusing on data at the macro level provides subject teaching staff and managers with a clearer indication of student satisfaction. The use of a percentage satisfied and percentage dissatisfied metric to classify and rank subjects is presented as an efficient alternative to the traditional approach, while recognising the value of the statistical mean to interpret data at the micro level. Originality/value: In light of the important role student feedback plays in determining university ranking, prioritising staff development and its potential function as an academic performance indicator, the effective interpretation of student evaluation data is critical. As economic factors become increasingly important to higher education providers, the role of evaluation data obtained from students will continue to gain traction.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, 2002. This thesis {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the measurement of consumer brand equity outcomes. The approach links financial performance with consumer behaviour to acknowledge the true source of a brand's strength. The methodology developed can be used to value brands for a variety of purposes ranging from corporate accounting, to taxation, to trademark protection and to capital market analysis. Its most significant application might well become the re-positioning of marketing as the leader of a company-wide activity that contributes to and protects shareholder wealth. The study concludes that the function of marketing has become too introspective and is in danger of allowing its essential role of building and maintaining brands to be taken over by the company as a whole. Brands today are becoming the responsibility of the board and marketing is increasingly seen as a function that deals with certain extemal agencies and buys their services. The author has studied the extant valuation methodologies and has found that they avoid incorporating consumer perceptions of brands: the main reason why brands exist and thrive. The explanation for this is to avoid what the financial community call the "soft issues". And yet it is these so called "soft issues" that determine the value of the brand. Brand equity is defined as the value a brand adds to a non-branded, or commodity, version. This value is invested in the brand by its users and to ignore this in a valuation methodology is to omit a key variable. The methodology presented in this thesis deals with this fundamental requirement and departs from the conventional approaches in four substantive ways: • It uses the Capital Asset Pricing Model to estimate the cost of capital which acts as a proxy for the commodity or non-branded version. • An adapted Delphi approach iteration survey isolates the super profits attributable to the brand from the other profit generating resources. • By analysing the category in which the brand sells according to four defining variables - longevity, leadership, barriers to entry, and vulnerability - time markers are set for notional category dominant and marginal brands. • Survey based consumer data provides quantitative statistics that are reduced to Brand Knowledge Structure (BKS) scores. These are substituted for the dominant and marginal brand markers to establish the Brand Expected Life. The brand value, captured by this approach, is the <b>capitalised</b> present <b>value</b> of the future cash flows. In developing a valuation approach that incorporates consumer behaviour a metric has been developed that links marketing activities directly with shareholder value; which raises the status of the marketing function and which provides the company with a tool to measure return on marketing investment and monitor the value of what in many cases is the firm's most important asset...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to report on the factors {{perceived}} to influence the turnover intent of Generation X public servants The problem: The researcher investigated the factors that Generation X public servants in South Africa perceive as influencing their turnover intent. Design: The problem was studied by way of a case study. The data were collected by means of semi -structured interviews. A total of eight purposively selected Generation X public servants participated in this study. Findings: The findings of the study show that the factors influencing the turnover intent of the Generation X public servants correspond to some of those proposed in the literature, including the nature of the job, traditional attitudes, and organisational context, both on the macro - and the micro-levels.. Furthermore, these factors are also congruent with the drivers of engagement as set out in the literature, specifically content, coping, compensation, community and career. One of the implications of the findings of this study is that although the value of employees to organisations were established as long ago as the Renaissance, organisations still do not capitalise on their most important asset. It is in particular the direct (line) manager that plays a crucial role in optimising the value -add of employees. Value: This study is original as it was the first to investigate the turnover intentions of Generation X public servants. Generation X employees are important as they are deemed to be the knowledge repositories of organisations and they are next in line to support the organisation when the Baby Boomers retire. The perceived turnover intentions correspond to some of the components of the generic turnover model proposed by Holtom et al. (2008). The question that arises is whether the turnover intentions of Generation X are any different from other generations. Conclusions: Given their unique characteristics, Generation X is a turnover risk, which is facilitated by employee mobility. The line manager has control over all the components influencing turnover intent, while engagement is omnipresent in these components. It is the role and responsibility of the line manager to facilitate engaged employees, which would equate to affectively committed employees, by attending to these components. In so doing the line manager can prevent the costly implications of employee turnover while <b>capitalising</b> on their <b>value</b> to the organisation. Business Managemen...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The bequest of a {{usufruct}} {{to one or}} more interim usufructuaries for {{a limited}} period after the decease of the first usufructuary is often utilised by estate planners to reduce the value of the ceasing limited interest and thus to effect a saving in respect of estate duty. The saving in respect of estate duty is effected {{due to the fact that}} - the value of the ceasing limited interest in the estate of the first usufructuary is calculated only over the duration of the period during which the interim usufructuary is entitled to the limited interest and not also over the life expectancy of the ultimate beneficiary, and - that, on the cessation of the interim usufruct due to the efflux of time. no estate duty is payable. The very first reference to this method appeared in an article published in The Taxpayer during 1965. Other authors like Meyerowitz, Silke and Stein and Davis, Beneke and Jooste also referred to this method without analysing it or investigating the legality thereof. All the aforementioned authors relied to a certain extent for their views on a judgment of acting judge Warner in Bassett v Commissioner for Inland Revenue (1 961 4 SA 769 (D)). This dissertation is therefore aimed at investigating the legality of the method and to focus on a few practical aspects regarding the application thereof as an estate planning instrument. An analysis of the wording of the charging clause (section II (a) (1) of the Estate Duty Act and the valuation clause (section 5 (1) of the act) has led to the belief that, in considering the validity of the method, it is extremely important to bear in mind the principles applicable to the vesting of testamentary rights. In terms of the valuation clause of the Estate Duty Ad the value of a ceasing limited interest for estate duty purposes is determined by <b>capitalising</b> the annual <b>value</b> of the right of enjoyment of the properly in which the deceased held any such limited interest to the extent to which the person who, upon the cessation of the said interest of the deceased in consequence of the death of the deceased, becomes entitled to any right of enjoyment of such properly. In terms of the charging clause "the person to whom any advantage accrues by the death of the deceased" is liable for the payment of estate duty in respect of the cessation of a limited right. In order to calculate the value of a ceasing limited interest and to determine the liability for payment of estate duty in respect thereof it is necessary to determine (a) the extent to which a successor in title of a deceased in consequence of the death of the deceased has become entitled to any right of enjoyment, and (b) to which person any advantage has accrued by the death of the deceased. After analysing the wording of section 5 (1) (b) and section 11 (a) (1) the writer has come to the following conclusions: (a) In the case of an interim usufruct the right of enjoyment of the first usufructury has to be capitalised only over the period of currency of the interim usufruct and not also over the life expectancy of the owner of the nuda proprietas. (b) Subsection 5 (l) (b) does not make provision for the valuation of an interim usufruct at the termination them due to the efflux of time. (c) Upon the decease of the first usufructuary an advantage as contemplated in section 11 (a) (1) accrues to the interim usufructury but not to the owner of the nuda proprietas. (d) On the cessation of an interim usufruct due to the efflux of time there is no person to whom any advantage accrues by the death of a deceased as contemplated in subsection 11 (a) (1), and consequently the owner of the nuda proprietas does not at that stage incur any liability for estate duty. In view of the aforegoing considerations the writer has come to the conclusion that the utilisation of this method does not constitute a contravention the provisions of the Estate Duty Ad. The artificiality of the valuation method prescribed in terms of subsection 5 (1) (b) lends itself to reducing the value of a limited interest by interposing a successor for a short period between the deceased and the ultimate beneficiary. It follows therefore that the utilisation of this method does not constitute tax evasion. Where the main consideration for the appointment of an intermediary usufructuary is not so much the possible benefit that may acme to the intermediary as the limitation of estate duty, the application of the method may constitute an avoidance of estate duty. The Estate Duty Act, however, does not contain any general anti-avoidance provision similar to section 103 of the lncome Tax Act. In utilising this method estate planners should therefore bear in mind the possibility that the fiscus may sooner or later introduce an amendment to the Estate Duty Act to close this loophole.
