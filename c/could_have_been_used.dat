5|$|The arms of I. bernissartensis {{were long}} (up to 75% {{the length of}} the legs) and robust, with rather {{inflexible}} hands built so that the three central fingers could bear weight. The thumbs were conical spikes that stuck out away from the three main digits. In early restorations, the spike was placed on the animal's nose. Later fossils revealed {{the true nature of the}} thumb spikes, although their exact function is still debated. They <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> for defense, or for foraging for food. The little finger was elongated and dextrous, and <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> to manipulate objects. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-3-2-4, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, etc. The legs were powerful, but not built for running, and each foot had three toes. The backbone and tail were supported and stiffened by ossified tendons, which were tendons that turned to bone during life (these rod-like bones are usually omitted from skeletal mounts and drawings).|$|E
5|$|A {{pathology}} {{has been}} identified on the tail of Apatosaurus, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might {{have been caused by}} the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> in combat, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.|$|E

5|$|At Winterfell, Ramsay Bolton mourns {{the death}} of Myranda, but {{commands}} that her corpse be fed to the hounds. Roose Bolton warns him that, despite their victory, they could be facing {{the wrath of the}} Lannisters in the future, and as such, they must secure the loyalty of the North's other nobles. Roose blames Ramsay for losing Sansa Stark, who, as a child of Eddard Stark, <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> as a figure-head for the North. As such, Roose implies that he will disinherit Ramsay if he cannot retrieve her and his unborn child is a son.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to minor {{issues with the}} art, some reviewers, including Entertainment Weeklys Tom Russo, felt that more fiction <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> in the mostly non-fiction writing. Due to the historical background of the book, Bone Sharps {{has been used in}} schools, as part of a study testing the effects of using comic books to educate young children. Since the release of the graphic novel, Ottaviani has published other slightly fictionalized historical stories, including Levitation: Physics and Psychology in the Service of Deception and Wire Mothers: Harry Harlow and the Science of Love.|$|E
5|$|Longrich et al. {{pointed out}} that the robust forelimbs and {{enlargement}} of a single finger in ingeniine oviraptorids is similar to that seen in modern animals that eat ants and termites, such as anteaters and pangolins, but the morpholology of ingeniine jaws does not support them being insectivorous. The researchers found that the function of ingeniine forelimbs was unclear, but suggested that they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> for scratching, tearing, or digging, though not prey capture.|$|E

5|$|The {{airborne}} forces made several mistakes, most notably when pilot error caused paratroopers from the 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment, a regiment of the U.S. 17th Airborne Division, to miss their drop zone and {{land on a}} British drop zone instead. However, the operation was a success, with both divisions capturing Rhine bridges and securing towns that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> by Germany to delay the advance of the British ground forces. The two divisions incurred more than 2,000 casualties, but captured about 3,500 German soldiers. The operation was the last large-scale Allied airborne operation of World War II.|$|E
5|$|The coin was {{probably}} struck at Canterbury {{in the late}} 6th century, most likely between 578 and 589. Although it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> as a coin, it was more likely made as a medallion to proclaim the wearer's conversion to Christianity. The coin is the oldest surviving example of Anglo-Saxon coinage. The design of the figured side has some affinities with Merovingian and Visigothic coins, but the side with the cross has few known predecessors in coinage, and is the first northern European depiction of a patriarchal cross in any medium.|$|E
5|$|The quatrefoil gunports in {{the lower}} levels <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> for both hand cannons and crossbows, with {{overlapping}} fields of fire. The roof was reinforced with large timber joints, and could have supported heavier bombards, possibly on wheeled carriages; the tower's considerable height would have allowed the bombards to reach across the river onto the higher ground overlooking the city. Getting the bombards onto the roof may have required them to be hoisted up on a winch; one such hoist formed part of the accounts for the tower's construction in 1398 and 1399.|$|E

5|$|Despite these successes, {{there was}} {{criticism}} of Dragoon by some Allied generals and contemporary commentators such as Bernard Montgomery, Arthur R. Wilson, and Chester Wilmot in the aftermath, {{mostly because of}} its geo-strategic implications. It was argued that Dragoon diverted highly-experienced men and much-needed material away from the continuing fighting at the Western front that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used,</b> instead, to bolster the Italian front or to hasten the advance towards the Rhine by the Overlord forces. The resulting loss of momentum gave Stalin on the Eastern Front a free hand to pursue his offensive efforts with more determination, allowing him to win the race towards Berlin and occupy the Balkans. Dragoon therefore had consequences reaching into the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|In July 1995, Slovenian {{archaeologist}} Ivan Turk {{discovered a}} bone carving {{in the northwest}} region of Slovenia. The carving, named the Divje Babe Flute, features four holes that Canadian musicologist Bob Fink determined <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> to play four notes of a diatonic scale. Researchers estimate the flute's age at between 43,400 and 67,000 years, making it the oldest known musical instrument and the only musical instrument associated with the Neanderthal culture. However, some archaeologists and ethnomusicologists dispute the flute's status as a musical instrument. German archaeologists have found mammoth bone and swan bone flutes dating back to 30,000 to 37,000 years old in the Swabian Alps. The flutes {{were made in the}} Upper Paleolithic age, and are more commonly accepted as being the oldest known musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|Other {{aspects of}} feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The {{shape of the}} skull of Allosaurus limited {{potential}} binocular vision to 20° of width, slightly {{less than that of}} modern crocodilians. As with crocodilians, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks. The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close, and the articulation of the claws suggests that they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> to hook things. Finally, the top speed of Allosaurus has been estimated at 30 to 55kilometers per hour (19 to 34miles per hour).|$|E

5|$|The oldest known tetrapodomorph is Kenichthys from China, dated {{at around}} 395 million years old. Two of the {{earliest}} tetrapodomorphs, dating from 380 Ma, were Gogonasus and Panderichthys. They had choanae and used their fins to move through tidal channels and shallow waters choked with dead branches and rotting plants. Their fins <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> to attach themselves to plants or similar while they were lying in ambush for prey. The universal tetrapod characteristics of front limbs that bend forward from the elbow and hind limbs that bend backward from the knee can plausibly be traced to early tetrapods living in shallow water. Pelvic bone fossils from Tiktaalik shows, if representative for early tetrapods in general, that hind appendages and pelvic-propelled locomotion originated in water before terrestrial adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Umbrella: In all written records, {{the oldest}} {{reference}} to a collapsible umbrella dates to the year 21 AD, when Wang Mang (r. 9–23) had one designed for a ceremonial four-wheeled carriage. The 2nd-century commentator Fu Qian added that this collapsible umbrella of Wang Mang's carriage had bendable joints which enabled them to be extended or retracted. A 1st century collapsible umbrella has since been recovered from the tomb of Wang Guang at Lelang Commandery in the Korean Peninsula, illustrated in a work by Harada and Komai. However, the Chinese collapsible umbrella is perhaps a concept that is yet centuries older than Wang's tomb. Zhou Dynasty bronze castings of complex bronze socketed hinges with locking slides and bolts—which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> for parasols and umbrellas—were found in an archeological site of Luoyang, dated to the 6th century BC.|$|E
5|$|Various {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that several individuals would gather eggs in a single nest, and arrange them so they could be protected by one individual, possibly a male. In 2010 David J. Varricchio and colleagues found that the relatively large clutch-size of oviraptorids and troodontids is most similar to those of modern archosaurs (birds and crocodilians, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs) that practice polygamous mating and extensive male parental care (as seen in paleognaths such as ostriches and emus). This reproductive system pre-dates the origin of birds and would therefore be the ancestral condition for modern birds, with biparental care (where both parents participate) being a later development. Many oviraptorosaurs are known to have had pygostyles on the end of their tails, which suggests the presence of feather-fans; these <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> for intraspecific communication such as courtship rituals.|$|E

5|$|Douglas Trumbull was {{the visual}} effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi {{designed}} the aliens. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget, at $3.3million, <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> {{to produce an}} additional film. His work helped lead to advances in motion control photography. The mother ship was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. The look of the ship was inspired by an oil refinery Spielberg saw at night in India. Instead of the metallic hardware look used in Star Wars, the emphasis was on a more luminescent look for the UFOs. One of the UFO models was an oxygen mask with lights attached to it, used because of its irregular shape. As a subtle in-joke, Dennis Muren (who had just finished working on Star Wars) put a small R2-D2 model onto {{the underside of the}} mothership. The model of the mothership is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at Washington Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In Barden and Grimaldi's article, {{the authors}} could not {{sufficiently}} identify the ant with enough confidence {{to place it}} in a subfamily. Instead, it was incertae sedis within the Formicidae. Although a recent published morphological study provided useful information on the mouthparts of basal ants, placing Cretaceous taxa is still difficult. However, synapomorphies (key diagnostic traits) <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> to attempt to place Zigrasimecia. Key synapomorphies for Sphecomyrmine ants include scape (the base segment of the antenna) length; petiole (narrow waist between the thorax and abdomen); and the metapleural gland (secretory glands), as indicated by Barry Bolton's diagnosis. The morphology of Z. tonsora shows a variety of autapomorphies (derived traits) not seen in any other ant species, particularly {{the structure of the}} mandibles and mesosomal sculpturing. Another issue in placing Z. tonsora is that the status of Sphecomyrminae had rarely ever been evaluated (perhaps once) via phylogenetic methodology. Due to this, it was possible that the subfamily was not monophyletic.|$|E
5|$|Many brick {{structures}} {{have been}} located at Kaveripumpattinam during on-shore, near shore and off-shore explorations; these provide proof for building construction during Sangam age. The on-shore structure include an I-shaped wharf and {{a structure that}} looks like a reservoir. The wharf has a number of wooden poles planted in its structure to enable anchorage of boats and to facilitate the handling of cargo. Among other structures, there is a Buddhist vihara with parts of it decorated using moulded bricks and stucco. Near shore excavations yielded a brick structure and a few terracotta ring wells. Off-shore explorations located a fifteen course brick structure, three courses of dressed stone blocks, brick bats and pottery. At Arikamedu, there were indications of a structure built substantially of timber, possibly a wharf. Conical jars that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> for storing wine and oil have been found near structures that could have been shops or storage areas. Evidence of continued building activity are present at this site, with the most distinctive structures being those of a possible warehouse, dyeing tanks and lined pits.|$|E
