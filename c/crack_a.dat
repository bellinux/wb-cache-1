25|$|When a {{new edition}} was released, the cryptographers were forced to start again. The {{original}} JN-25A system replaced the 'Blue' code (as Americans called it), and used five-digit numbers, each divisible by three (and so usable as a quick, and somewhat reliable, error check, as well {{as something of a}} 'crib' to cryptanalysts), giving a total of 33,334 legal code values. To make it harder to <b>crack</b> <b>a</b> code value, meaningless additives (from a large table or book of five-digit numbers) were added arithmetically to each five-digit cipher element. JN-25B superseded the first release of JN-25 at the start of December 1940. JN-25B had 55,000 valid words, and while it initially used the same additive list, this was soon changed and the cryptanalysts found themselves entirely locked out again.|$|E

25|$|Improvements in {{computing}} technology keep {{increasing the}} rate at which guessed passwords can be tested. For example, in 2010, the Georgia Tech Research Institute developed a method of using GPGPU to crack passwords much faster. Elcomsoft invented the usage of common graphic cards for quicker password recovery in August 2007 and soon filed a corresponding patent in the US. As of 2011, commercial products are available that claim the ability to test up to 112,000 passwords per second on a standard desktop computer using a high-end graphics processor. Such a device will <b>crack</b> <b>a</b> 6 letter single-case password in one day. Note that the work can be distributed over many computers for an additional speedup proportional to the number of available computers with comparable GPUs. Special key stretching hashes are available that take a relatively long time to compute, reducing {{the rate at}} which guessing can take place. Although it is considered best practice to use key stretching, many common systems do not.|$|E

Nerissa tells Gregor she believes Sandwich purposely made it [...] "difficult to read" [...] in order to emphasize {{how difficult it is to}} understand, and Gregor later hypothesizes that Sandwich forced the humans to read it using mirrors so that, as a person read, [...] " [...] would see [...] ". Ripred similarly points out that an [...] "annoying little dance" [...] Boots makes up to go along with the prophecy's refrain echoes this theme, by forcing the questers to turn and see themselves before they realize that the plague originated with the humans.
