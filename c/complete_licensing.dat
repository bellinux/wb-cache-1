40|$|This {{is a case}} of {{effective}} and efficient e-Governance where the licenses are issued electronically by using of IT for web based delivery service in the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT). Now a days <b>complete</b> <b>licensing</b> procedure is dealing through electronically i. e. Exporter/Importer apply electronically to get the Importer Exporter Code(IEC), submitting the fees as well as necessary documents electronically and received the IEC electronically. Trading Community is also availing the Online facility to submit the application for any licensing scheme, depositing the licensing fees, enclosing the required document from their end. The official procedure is also automated like initiating the note sheet, generating the ecom number, consolation of license fees and issuing the license to the exporter. There is fifty percent role of customs involved in trading. So that Electronic Data Interchange(EDI) facility is also established with Customs. In addition to above services, Bank Realization Certificate(BRC) is also integrated with this system. Henceforth an Exporter/Importer is equipped with electronic services without visiting to the office of DGFT, Customs and Bank. The web has been strategically leveraged for reengineering and transformation of trade processes for an economic trade facilitation...|$|E

40|$|Commercial codes {{usually come}} with a {{licencing}} mechanism in order to restrict their use. The lack of license management schemes is becoming a major obstacle for the commercial exploitation of existing Grid infrastructures. In this paper we present a <b>complete</b> <b>license</b> management architecture that enables a pay per use license management, which can be deployed together with an on-demand computing scenario. In order to cover the entire license management process, a <b>complete</b> Grid-friendly <b>license</b> management architecture was implemented and is presented here. The license management architecture we present {{is based on the}} re- quirements we collected from 18 real buisness applications. The Grid-friendly solution that we developed has various bene ts that we believe will lead to a fast adoption by independent software vendors (ISVs) and their clients and hence pave the way for commercial applications in grid environments...|$|R

In return, it rewards the SUs with an incentive time during which they can use the <b>complete</b> <b>licensed</b> bandwidth to transmit their own data, {{without the need for}} spectrum sensing. With the objective of maximizing the time incentive, we develop a MAC layer resource allocation strategy and a corresponding routing technique.

Simulation results are provided, which are indicative of the effectiveness of the proposed design...|$|R

Races vary from short beginner events to multi-hour endurance races and also rallying events against an opponent. In addition, the car shops are now organized by country and then by manufacturer, which some find to be more intuitive than the East/West City method used in its predecessor.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} how much cell phones and just speaking (similar to speaking to someone in the car vs a hands-free cell phone task) interfere with visual attention skills as might be required in a driving situation. Influence of cell phones on attention has been noted but little research has been <b>completed.</b> <b>Licensed</b> adult drivers were divided into three groups (ns = 15) with all subjects taking the Connors Continuous Performance Test II. Group 1 performed without any distractions: those in Group 2 performed with someone in the same room talking to them: Group 3 engaged in a cell phone conversation during the task. Overall, there were substantial differences among groups on all variables, but primarily between the control group and the two experimental groups. While the cell phone group had lower mean scores than the talking group overall, the differences were not significant. Thus, while cell phones were distracting to visual attention functions on the Connors task, they were not more distracting than a similarly active conversation without a cell phone...|$|R
