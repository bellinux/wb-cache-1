5000|$|Baisao's {{method of}} {{preparing}} tea {{was referred to}} as sencha, or [...] "simmered tea". In this method, whole tea leaves would be tossed into a pot of boiling water and simmered {{for a short period of}} time. This style of tea differed from matcha, the most <b>common</b> <b>tea</b> in Japan at the time, which consists of tea leaves ground into a fine powder. The method of brewing tea by grinding it into a powder and whisking it with hot water was popular in China in the Song dynasty, during which Zen Buddhist monks first brought the practice to Japan. By contrast, the Obaku school of Zen specialized in brewing loose leaf green tea, a style that had gradually become popular in China during the Ming dynasty. Sencha partisans of the time opposed the rigid, elaborate formalism of the traditional chanoyu tea ceremony, which uses matcha. The comparative simplicity of adding tea leaves to water appealed to many Japanese monks and intellectuals (among them Baisao and much of his social circle) who admired the carefree attitude advocated by the ancient Chinese sages. Baisao himself saw tea as a path to spiritual enlightenment, a point he made repeatedly in his poetry.|$|E

40|$|Sensors {{capable of}} in-liquid {{operation}} are of primary importance {{not only for}} biosensors applications but also for liquid monitoring. Thin film electroacoustic (TEA) devices have emerged as promising choice for such applications. The most <b>common</b> <b>TEA</b> devices are the thin film bulk acoustic wave resonator (FBAR) and the Lamb wave resonator (LWR). FBAR operating on the shear mode have been widely studied in view of biosensors applications. A theoretical framework describing the in-liquid sensitivity features of LWR employing the S- 0 mode (S- 0 -LWR) has been experimentally proven recently. However, a comparison between both devices has not been performed yet. Here we theoretically and experimentally compare AlN-based S- 0 -LWR and FBARs on their solidly mounted modality (SMR), {{in terms of their}} in-liquid sensitivity features at similar frequencies. S- 0 -LWR prove to be slightly more sensitive to the density and viscosity of the liquids. Moreover, if a metallic bottom electrode is not deposited on their backside they can also sense variations in the dielectric permittivity of the liquid, which cannot be done with common SMRs...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{combination}} of levodopa (L-DOPA) and carbidopa {{is the most}} commonly-used treatment for symptom management in Parkinson’s disease. Studies have shown that concomitant use of a COMT inhibitor is highly beneficial in controlling the wearing-off phenomenon by improving L-DOPA bioavailability as well as brain entry. The present study sought to determine whether (-) -epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG), a <b>common</b> <b>tea</b> polyphenol, {{can serve as a}} naturallyoccurring COMT inhibitor that also possesses neuroprotective actions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using both in vitro and in vivo models, we investigated the modulating effects of EGCG on L-DOPA methylation as well as on chemically induced oxidative neuronal damage and degeneration. EGCG strongly inhibited human liver COMT-mediated O-methylation of L-DOPA in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro, with an average IC 50 of 0. 36 mM. Oral administration of EGCG moderately lowered the accumulation of 3 -O-methyldopa in the plasma and striatum of rats treated with L-DOPA + carbidopa. In addition, EGCG also reduced glutamate-induced oxidative cytotoxicity in cultured HT 22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells through inactivation of the nuclear factor kB-signaling pathway. Under in vivo conditions, administration of EGCG exerted a strong protective effect against kainic acid-induced oxidative neuronal death in the hippocampus of rats. Conclusions/Significance: These observations suggest that oral administration of EGCG may have significant beneficia...|$|E

40|$|Tea is a {{beverage}} made by steeping {{leaves in}} boiling water. The <b>common</b> <b>tea</b> plant is the evergreen shrub Camellia sinensis. There are several varieties {{of this species}} of plant, a well known one being the Indian Assam tea (C. sinensis var. assamica Kitamura). Although {{there is a growing}} number of countries producing teas, in a multiplicity of blends, there are in fact only three main types of Camellia tea, green, ‘oolong’, and black. The difference lies in the ‘fermentation’. A brewed cup of tea contains a moderate amount of caffeine, volatile oils, tannin and several B-complex vitamins. The flavor of tea is produced by these volatile oils, while astringency and color come from tannin. Tea is the most popular and cheapest beverage, next to water, in the world. It is consumed by a range of age groups in all levels of society. Some three billion cups of tea are consumed daily worldwide. However, 50 - 60 % of the production cost is in the labor cost. The tea industry makes a vital contribution to the economy of the producing countries. The countries that produce tea are largely developing countries with large pools of low-cost labor.

40|$|Two {{biological}} antioxidant capacity assays, {{based on}} a reactive oxygen species inducible E. coli strain, were described. The strain harbored fusion genes sodA::gfp, and these genes measure oxidative stress by quantitatively responding to superoxide anions. The system measures ascorbate and Trolox antioxidant capacity in response to free radical generation by paraquat. Antioxidant capacity {{was measured by the}} degree of inhibition of induced fluorescence. At a fixed oxidant concentration, specific fluorescence decreased as the concentration of the antioxidant increased. Both assays were validated for their reproducibility of the calibration curves, their precision and their accuracy. In both assays, the limit of detection and the limit of quantitation were 2. 50 mM and 5. 00 mM, respectively. The hydrophilic antioxidant capacity assay was also correlated with the currently used standard assays, ORAC (r = 0. 981) and DPPH assays (r = 0. 841). By utilizing the autofluorescent green fluorescent protein (GFP) as the reporter gene and a multi-well plate reader as the screening tool, the method was noninvasive and cost effective. Compared to other available antioxidant capacity assays, most of which need further dilution of the test samples, this assay {{is one of the few}} assays that is able to assess samples with high antioxidant concentrations. Furthermore, since living cells are employed, actual bio-availability is assessed.
