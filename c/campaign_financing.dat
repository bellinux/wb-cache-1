5|$|At the {{expiration}} {{of his term}} as lieutenant governor in 1995, Patton announced his candidacy for governor. The 1995 gubernatorial election was novel in several ways, following a 1992 constitutional amendment. It was the first election in Kentucky history in which the governor and lieutenant governor were elected as a ticket. Another new provision stated that if no candidate received at least 40percent {{of the vote in}} his or her party's primary, a runoff election would occur between the top two candidates. Most significantly, {{for the first time in}} Kentucky history the winners of each race would be allowed to succeed themselves in office and serve another term. Also, as a result of campaign finance reform passed under Governor Jones, candidates would receive public <b>campaign</b> <b>financing</b> and would have their campaign spending capped, negating the advantage of wealthy candidates.|$|E
5|$|Cordray {{announced}} his 2008 candidacy for Ohio {{state attorney general}} on June 11, 2008. He was endorsed by Ohio Governor Ted Strickland. The vacancy {{in the office of}} the attorney general was created by the May 14, 2008, resignation of Marc Dann who was embroiled in a sex scandal. Several leading Republican party contenders such as Montgomery, Jim Petro, DeWine, Maureen O'Connor, and Rob Portman declined to enter the race. Cordray's opponents in the race were Michael Crites (Republican), and Robert M. Owens (Independent). Cordray had a large financial advantage over his opponents with approximately 30 times as much <b>campaign</b> <b>financing</b> as Crites. Crites' campaign strategies included attempts to link Cordray with Dann—an association The Columbus Dispatch called into question—and promoting himself as having more years of prosecutorial experience. Cordray asserted that he managed the state's money safely despite the turbulence of the financial crisis of 2007–2008.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} seen to have {{promoted}} anti-incumbency, a scandal regarding campaign finance followed allegation that the Centre Party's Timo Kalli's, who was also {{the head of the}} party's parliamentary group, admission in early May 2009 that he violated the law on reporting electoral <b>campaign</b> <b>financing</b> by not disclosing financial contributions he received for his election campaign during the previous election in 2007. When the media then delved further into the issue, stories started to emerge of common practice with a multitude of MPs not disclosing their financial benefactors, a practice which was not punishable under Finnish law. The media investigations focused on a group of entrepreneurs called Kehittyvien Maakuntien Suomi (Finland of Developing Provinces) who financed the electoral campaigns of numerous high-profile government and opposition candidates. Further investigations revealed that many recipients of their financial support did not register or even mention the amounts they received from the group. Then Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen was {{at the core of the}} accusations after the investigations showed he had also been among the beneficiaries of the groups' financing; this was despite one of the members of the group who had planned to build the biggest shopping mall in the country received Vanhanen's support for the plans against the grain of public opinion, thus eliciting accusations that he could have been influenced by the individual. Blame was also put on the Centre Party's secretary Jarmo Korhonen. This was said to have helped the True Finns.|$|E

40|$|Proposed <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> {{reforms and}} critiques of current <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> {{jurisprudence}} are incomplete because <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reformers overlook social and historical realities related to race. This Article uses race as an analytical factor {{to develop a}} more comprehensive understanding of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance.</b> Past state-sanctioned discrimination has contributed to current racial disparities in property. Under the current <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> system, these disparities in property shape the racial distribution of political influence no less than poll taxes, literacy tests, or at-large electoral districts. Further, seemingly neutral <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> doctrine threatens to lead to future racial disparities in the political distribution of societal resources. The consideration of race also allows for an examination of other critical issues ignored by reformers, such as racially selective enforcement of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> regulations and the adverse impact of some reform provisions on minority political participation...|$|R

40|$|This Essay {{seeks to}} provide a {{theoretical}} framework for conceptualizing this relationship and considering reforms. Part I traces the variation of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> regimes across several political eras and several jurisdictional scales. Strikingly, although similar six-figure <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> scandals prompted the reforms of each era, federal lawmakers in each era have drawn progressively lower one-size-fits-all contribution limits and disclosure thresholds. Meanwhile, state <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> laws have been more carefully calibrated to reflect the electoral and financial circumstances of particular electoral contests. Part II considers the currently permissible means and ends of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> law and how they constrain the calibration of contribution limits and disclosure thresholds. Part III explains how a recalibration of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> laws in some jurisdictions might bring these regulations into alignment with the constitutional justifications for-and policy goals of-our system of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> laws. Recalibration offers an important opportunity for both opponents and proponents of regulation to ensure a better fit between the means and ends of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> law...|$|R

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} Tillman Act of 1907, Congress has imposed {{a growing number}} of {{restrictions}} on elections and <b>campaign</b> <b>financing.</b> The most significant piece of legislation has been the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act. It was this legislation that was at issue in the Supreme Court's seminal decision, Buckley v.

500|$|In Everson v.

Speech rights were expanded significantly {{in a series of}} 20th and 21st-century court decisions which protected various forms of political speech, anonymous speech, <b>campaign</b> <b>financing,</b> pornography, and school speech; these rulings also defined a series of exceptions to First Amendment protections. The Supreme Court overturned English common law precedent to increase the burden of proof for defamation and libel suits, most notably in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). Commercial speech, however, is less protected by the First Amendment than political speech, and is therefore subject to greater regulation.|$|E

However, the Court struck down the [...] "choice of expenditure" [...] rule, which required that parties could either make coordinated expenditures for all its candidates, or permit candidates to spend independently, but not both, which the Court agreed [...] "placed an unconstitutional burden on the parties' right to make unlimited independent expenditures."
