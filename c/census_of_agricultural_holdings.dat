40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to show and assess {{the changes in the}} {{organizational}} structures in Bulgaria during the period 1998 - 2004 and to analyze the problems of the market-oriented structures in Bulgarian agriculture in the period leading to EU accession. The evaluation of the changes in the distribution and characteristics of the pro-ductive structures is based on the <b>census</b> <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>holdings</b> carried out in Bulgaria in 2003 and the results of two scientific projects done by the authors. The paper encompasses the following parts: • Results of organizational restructuring during the period 1998 - 2004; • Agricultural producers ’ problems in adapting to agricultural policy requi-rements; • Expected changes in the characteristics of organizational structures. The paper defends the thesis that the organizational restructuring of the agricul-tural sector is not yet completed although the changes initiated after 2000 are similar to those in the EU. Gradually, in the pre-accession period, the characteris-tics of the organizational structures will come to resemble those of the developed EU countries...|$|E
40|$|Between the 1998 and 2000 <b>agricultural</b> <b>censuses,</b> {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>holdings</b> fell from one million to 664   000. This fall {{resulted}} in {{a slight increase in}} the relative concentration <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> production, with the smallest holdings decreasing in size and the largest holdings becoming larger. There are two explanatory variables which today have a greater influence on holding size than in the past: the age of the manager <b>of</b> the <b>agricultural</b> holding, with younger managers coming to increasingly larger holdings, and the legal form. The starting size has little incidence on the growth of holdings: the concentration of production occurs more due to a rise in economic size thresholds than the cornering of the market by the largest holdings. The slight movement towards concentration observed over the last 15 years is essentially linked to the development of corporate farming, which is better suited to larger holdings than the individual farmer.
