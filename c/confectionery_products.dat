25|$|Various tactics {{adopted to}} work around {{inflation}} include decreasing the quantity of an item within a set (such as removing a pencil within a larger pack) to reduce the production costs and replacing third-party brands with their own-brand alternatives. Examples of branded products being replaced include After Eights and Toblerone, both being <b>confectionery</b> <b>products.</b> Poundland planned to launch a Toblerone replacement in July 2017, by offering a closely resembling own-brand product named Twin Peaks, though following a legal battle from Toblerone's manufacturer, the product had to be redesigned to be distinctly different. The retailer dismisses concerns about a weaker pound, as this reduces freight costs which counteracts the impact.|$|E
