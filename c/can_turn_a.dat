25|$|Blood doping {{is often}} used by athletes, drug addicts or {{military}} personnel for reasons such as to increase physical stamina, to fake a drug detection test or simply to remain active and alert during the duty-times respectively. However {{a lack of knowledge}} and insufficient experience <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> blood transfusion into a sudden death. For example, when individuals run the frozen blood sample directly in their veins this cold blood rapidly reaches the heart, where it disturbs the heart's original pace leading to cardiac arrest and sudden death.|$|E
25|$|Resistance {{thermometers}} and thermistors {{are generally}} used in two ways. First, {{they can be}} used as thermometers: By measuring the resistance, the temperature of the environment can be inferred. Second, {{they can be used}} in conjunction with Joule heating (also called self-heating): If a large current is running through the resistor, the resistor's temperature rises and therefore its resistance changes. Therefore, these components {{can be used in a}} circuit-protection role similar to fuses, or for feedback in circuits, or for many other purposes. In general, self-heating <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> resistor into a nonlinear and hysteretic circuit element. For more details see Thermistor#Self-heating effects.|$|E
25|$|All manned {{landings}} {{happened during}} the lunar daytime. Thus, the stars were outshone by the sun and by sunlight reflected off the Moon's surface. The astronauts' eyes were adapted to the sunlit landscape around {{them so that they}} could not see the relatively faint stars. Likewise, cameras were set for daylight exposure and could not detect the stars. Camera settings <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> well-lit background to black when the foreground object is brightly lit, forcing the camera to increase shutter speed so that the foreground light does not wash out the image. A demonstration of this effect is here. The effect is similar to not being able to see stars from a brightly lit car park at night – the stars only become visible when the lights are turned off. The astronauts could see stars with the naked eye only when they were {{in the shadow of the}} Moon.|$|E

500|$|The {{leaves of}} the red maple offer {{the easiest way to}} {{distinguish}} it from its relatives. As with nearly all North American maple trees, they are deciduous and arranged oppositely on the twig. They are typically [...] long and wide with 3-5 palmate lobes with a serrated margin. The sinuses are typically narrow, but the leaves can exhibit considerable variation. When 5 lobes are present, the three at the terminal end are larger than the other two near the base. In contrast, the {{leaves of the}} related silver maple, A. saccharinum, are much more deeply lobed, more sharply toothed and characteristically have 5 lobes. The upper side of A. rubrums leaf is light green and the underside is whitish and can be either glaucous or hairy. The leaf stalks are usually red and are up to [...] long. Furthermore, the leaves <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> brilliant red in autumn, but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals.|$|E
500|$|Writing in The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—described by a Fleming biographer, John Pearson, as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—was damning in his review, {{saying that}} From Russia, with Love was Fleming's [...] "longest and poorest book". Boucher further {{wrote that the}} novel {{contained}} [...] "as usual, sex-cum-sadism with a veneer of literacy but without the occasional brilliant setpieces". The critic for the New York Herald Tribune, conversely, wrote that [...] "Mr Fleming is intensely observant, acutely literate and <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> cliché into a silk purse with astute alchemy". Robert R Kirsch, writing in the Los Angeles Times, also disagreed with Boucher, saying that [...] "the espionage novel has been brought up to date by a superb practitioner of that nearly lost art: Ian Fleming." [...] In Kirsch's opinion, From Russia, with Love [...] "has everything of the traditional plus the most modern refinements in the sinister arts of spying".|$|E

2500|$|In music, an {{electronic}} tuner is {{a device that}} detects and displays the pitch of musical notes played on a musical instrument. [...] "Pitch" [...] is the highness or lowness of a musical note, which is typically measured in Hertz. Simple tuners indicate—typically with an analog needle-dial, LEDs, or an LCD screen—whether a pitch is lower, higher, or equal to the desired pitch. In the 2010s, software applications <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> smartphone, tablet, or personal computer into a tuner. More complex and expensive tuners indicate pitch more precisely. Tuners vary in size from units that fit in a pocket to 19" [...] rack-mount units. Instrument technicians, piano tuners, and violin-family luthiers typically use more expensive, accurate tuners.|$|E

2500|$|... "Researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a Department of Energy lab in Tennessee, have {{discovered}} a mechanism for converting carbon dioxide into ethanol. Their method takes advantage of nanotechnology, creating a catalyst that produces ethanol from a solution of carbon dioxide in water. 'We discovered somewhat by accident that this material worked,' said Adam Rondinone, the lead {{author of a new}} study in the journal ChemistrySelect. 'We were trying to study the first step of a proposed reaction when we realized that the catalyst was doing the entire reaction on its own.' The discovery may change {{the way we think about}} carbon dioxide. If it could be captured and turned into a fuel, then carbon dioxide – the earth-polluting byproduct of global dependence on fossil fuels – could help high-energy societies work toward energy independence. Repurposing carbon dioxide could be invaluable for the environment, the researchers say. Converting it into ethanol <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> greenhouse gas into a gasoline-like fuel source. Ethanol contains one-third less energy than gasoline but produces far fewer byproducts when burned in engines, which can limit further carbon emissions. 'Closing the carbon cycle by utilizing CO2 as a feedstock for currently used commodities, in order to displace a fossil feedstock, is an appropriate intermediate step towards a carbon-free future,” the researchers wrote in the study." ...|$|E

[...] He was {{referred}} to in 1919 as [...] "the best all around athlete Yale has produced, having won his varsity letter when at Yale, in three branches of sport -- football, baseball and crew." [...] In addition to football and basketball, Sharpe was also a fine baseball player and a skilled gymnast. [...] In 1900, The New York Times noted that [...] "Sharpe of Yale {{is as good a}} first baseman as he is a halfback, which is saying a good deal." [...] In 1915, Dr. A.C. May, a noted athletic trainer, rated Sharpe as [...] "the greatest living all round athlete today." [...] May supported his selection as follows:"Look at him once and you will see the reason for his success. [...] He is 6 feet, 1 inch tall and weights 196 pounds. [...] He is evenly proportioned and owes his build, not to athletics, but in gymnastics, and he owed his athletic success not to his build so much as his ability to handle his body, which he developed in the gymnasium. [...] He can handle himself on the bars and rings and other apparatus with as much skill as he can play football or other sports. [...] He <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> backward and forward flip and he knows the other tricks of a gymnast. ...

[...] In the liner notes to Essential George Jones: The Spirit of Country Rich Kienzle states, [...] "Jones sings of people and stories that are achingly human. He <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> ballad into a catharsis by wringing every possible emotion from it, making it a primal, strangled cry of anguish". [...] In 1994, country music historian Colin Escott pronounced, [...] "Contemporary country music is virtually founded on reverence for George Jones. Walk through a room of country singers and conduct a quick poll, George nearly always tops it." [...] In the wake of Jones's death, Merle Haggard pronounced in Rolling Stone, [...] "His voice was like a Stradivarius violin: [...] one of the greatest instruments ever made." [...] Emmylou Harris wrote, [...] "...when you hear George Jones sing, you are hearing a man who takes a song and makes it a work of art - always," [...] a quote that appeared on the sleeve of Jones' 1976 album The Battle. In the documentary Same Ole Me, several country music stars offer similar thoughts. Johnny Cash: [...] "When people ask me who my favorite country singer is, I say, 'You mean besides George Jones?'"; [...] Randy Travis: [...] "It sounds like he's lived every minute of every word that he sings and there's very few people who can do that"; Tom T. Hall: [...] "It was always Jones who got the message across just right"; and Roy Acuff: [...] "I'd give anything if I could sing like George Jones".
