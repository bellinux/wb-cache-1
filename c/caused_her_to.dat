5|$|As a child, Douglas {{was very}} close with her mother after her parents' separation. She {{witnessed}} her mother's emotional unraveling that <b>caused</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be institutionalized, and even long after her mother returned to live with her, she exhibited bizarre, childlike behaviors.

5|$|Internet venues {{unrelated}} to medical issues {{have also been}} the audience for such cases. A member of an online fan club for the musical Rent divulged numerous illnesses that <b>caused</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> slip {{in and out of}} comas, prompting some cast members to send sympathy cards. When other fan club members expressed their concern, even purchasing airline tickets to visit the sick woman, she reported that she had immediately improved.|$|E
5|$|Lovato {{also stated}} that her struggles with addictions not only <b>caused</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> nearly {{overdose}} several times, but later began to impact her ability to perform and promote her third studio album Unbroken, referencing a 2012 performance on the eleventh season of American Idol where she was severely hungover.

The ship was renamed Vrystaat in South African service and made many overseas port visits before corrosion problems <b>caused</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be reduced to reserve in 1963. Vrystaat was sunk as a target by a South African submarine in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Berry dated Chicago dentist John Ronan from March 1989 to October 1991. In November 1993, Ronan sued Berry for $80,000 in what {{he claimed}} were unpaid loans to help launch her career. Berry contended that the money was a gift, and a judge {{dismissed}} the case because Ronan did not list Berry as a debtor when he filed for bankruptcy in 1992. According to Berry, a beating from a former abusive boyfriend during the filming of The Last Boy Scout punctured her eardrum and <b>caused</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> lose eighty percent of her hearing in her left ear. Berry has never named the abuser but {{has said that he}} is someone well known in Hollywood.|$|E

5|$|Courbet became {{flagship}} of Vice-Amiral Charlier between 6 June 1919 and 20 October 1920. The {{following year}} {{she became a}} gunnery training ship at Toulon, but she suffered a serious boiler fire in June 1923 that <b>caused</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be repaired and given the first of her upgrades between July and April 1924 at La Seyne-sur-Mer. She had another boiler fire in August 1924 and remained under repair {{for the rest of}} the year, but resumed her duties as a gunnery training ship upon her return from the dockyard. She was refitted again between January 1927 and January 1931. She was transferred from the gunnery school to the navigation school in 1937, before her final prewar refit between April 1937 to September 1938. By 1939 she reverted to her role as a gunnery training ship, but she was ordered to Brest and Quiberon with her sister Paris upon the outbreak of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Despite her 50 guns, Centurions {{armament}} {{left her}} vulnerable as most were carronades, short-range heavy cannon that were useless {{in the face}} of the long-range gunnery from Marengo. Centurion consequently suffered severe damage and by 13:15 had been holed, with her rigging wrecked and her anchor cable shot through, which <b>caused</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> slowly drift away from the shore, out of control. Seeing that his opponent was disabled, Linois decided not to press the attack and issued orders for his squadron, accompanied by their prize, to sail away. Lind gradually regained control of his ship and even managed to raise some sail in pursuit, but the French were too far ahead. After some final parting shots, Centurion anchored as her crew set about repairing the damage. Linois remained within sight for the rest of the day, but showed no sign of renewing the action; he disappeared on the north-east horizon at dusk.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 14â€“15 April 1809, contact was {{maintained}} with the French squadron by Recruit, Captain Charles John Napier firing on the rearmost ship Hautpoult and coming under fire from the French stern-chasers, guns situated {{in the rear of}} a ship to fire on pursuers. Shortly after 04:00, Pompee came within range and began to fire her bow-chasers, the chase continuing westwards into the Caribbean Sea. Frustrated by her inability to escape Recruit, Hautpoult eventually turned and fired a broadside at 10:45, causing severe damage but failing to dissuade Napier, who immediately counter-attacked. Hautpoults manoeuvre <b>caused</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> lose ground to her pursuers and throughout the day the squadrons exchanged shots, neither causing significant damage but the French being driven deeper into British held waters and unable to drive off their opponents.|$|E
