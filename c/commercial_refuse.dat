5000|$|Travellers {{continue}} {{to engage in}} informal and self-employed labour, particularly metal recycling and car scrapping, as this type of employment supports [...] "an independent and nomadic way of life." [...] During the 1980s Travellers increasingly gravitated toward casual labour that allowed for greater autonomy than formal labour, motivated {{in part by the}} racist conditions of formal labour markets in Ireland. For employment, Travellers scavenged from the Galway city dump as well as industrial and <b>commercial</b> <b>refuse</b> bins for scrap metal. Work in the scrap metal trade at the Galway City dump has been described by Helleiner as being exclusively performed by women, working in unsanitary conditions amidst piles of garbage.

50|$|In the 1870s, St Peters was an {{important}} brickmaking centre with a large brickworks on the site now known as Sydney Park, {{on the corner of}} Mitchell Road (now Sydney Park Road) and the Princes Highway, close to St Peters railway station. The brickworks closed after World War II and for most of the 1960s and 1970s the site was used as a rubbish tip with the vast clay pits eventually filled by domestic and <b>commercial</b> <b>refuse.</b> After the tip closed in the 1980s, Sydney Park was created on the site. The area was covered, landscaped and revegetated so that several large artificial hills were created with sweeping views south to Botany Bay and north to the city. Four towering chimneys that carried exhaust from the brick kilns remain standing and have been incorporated into the Sydney Park site along with some of the kilns and various pieces of large brickworks machinery. The remains of the brickworks were heritage-listed.|$|E

40|$|This section {{includes}} the volume reduction, by combustion, {{of domestic and}} <b>commercial</b> <b>refuse</b> (often referred to as ‘Municipal Solid Waste ’ (MSW)). Principally this section {{includes the}} emissions from chimneys and duct work because {{of the availability of}} measurement data. The combustion of hazardous or chemical waste is covered in the chapter on SNAP 090202. 2 CONTRIBUTION TO TOTAL EMISSIONS The relative proportion of emissions contributed by waste incineration varies between pollutants. The emissions of compounds such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and particulate matter (Table 2. 3) from waste incineration are unlikely to contribute significantly to total emissions. However waste incinerators have been a major source of emissions of PCDD/Fs, other persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and some heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury (Leech 1993). MSW incinerators in many countries now apply extensive abatement techniques and comply with emission limits, and in these cases the contribution of MSW incinerators to total emissions of PCDD/Fs and heavy metals has greatly decreased. The CORINAIR 90 inventory indicates the contribution of emissions released from the incineration of domestic/municipal waste to total emissions in countries (Table 1).

The study showed that household and commercial Refuses are the most Refuses collected by the Refuse worker at 98. 1 % is household refuse and 97. 1 % is <b>commercial</b> <b>refuse,</b> per in mind that same workers deal with deferent type of refuse. It also showed that most Refuse workers do not wear face mask (98. 6 %), overall (85. 5 %), rubber boot (78. 9 %), and protective gloves (45 %). The study also showed that Refuse workers suffered from different types of diseases and symptoms, such as sore throat, cough, and high temperature (55. 3 %), diarrhea or bloody stool (27. 9 %), shortness of breath (25 %), and skin disease (20. 2 %). Refuse workers were prone to different injuries, such as hit by any hard or sharp objects (61. 1 %), lift more than their capacity (37. 4 %), and fall while pulling or pushing the Refuse trolley (35. 6 %). The study also showed that Refuse workers whom were stuck with hard object (21. 6 %), pricked by hypodermic needles (20. 2 %), twisted ankle while on duty (34. 1 %), and suffered from a muscle tear (22. 1 %). It showed that (93. 8 %) of Refuse workers were not vaccinated for tetanus and (85. 6 %) were not vaccinated for hepatitis. In conclusion, Refuse workers face a tremendous health challenges. Refuse workers with middle age and with low level of education were at higher risk. Refuse workers should be provided with the necessary protective measures (face mask, protective gloves, overall, and rubber boot). Education and training programs should be provided to all, and routine medical checkup program should be implemented and maintained, to keep them safe and secure...|$|E
40|$|This report aims {{to provide}} the Christchurch Civic Pride Organization with a base set of {{information}} to enable planning and co-ordination of its future activities. The report describes residents' attitudes to city beautification, present council services, recycling and litter. A section is included on communications, and profiles are developed which describe respondents from each section. The majority of Christchurch residents do take pride in their city however, there are some areas of concern. Ensuring {{that the cost of}} future shopping area development is apportioned fairly between those commercial organizations who benefit and the rate payer. When designing future developments such as malls, it is necessary to take account of access problems such as parking. This is particularly relevant considering the aging population. Most residents appear satisfied with the gate collection of household refuse. The increasing use of commercial rubbish removal organizations by higher income groups may be in response to the population's lack of understanding and acceptance of transfer stations. Those who are reluctant to use metro refuse stations tend to be older people or those on lower incomes. Of those who have visited, the majority consider the charges too high and this may contribute to the move to <b>commercial</b> <b>refuse</b> removal. There appear to be strong economic considerations which motivate residents' behaviour in rubbish disposal and hence there is an increasing level of acceptance of burning rubbish. Although the skip schemes seem reasonably well patronized there is concern about adequate communication about this facility. Recycling of products could be improved through developing co-ordinated and on-going programmes. One such financially viable option is to provide a facility for the collection of recycled engine oil. It would appear that should there be a market for recyclable material then gate collection would be the system supported most by the public. Most residents perceive there to be a greater 'city-wide' problem than one pertaining to specific areas. However, there were some suburbs which were considered to have a litter problem. Paper, food containers and cans seem to be the most commonly perceived littered items. Although air pollution is considered a form of litter, restricting the burning of rubbish, or wood or coal for heating seems to be an economic consideration. It was noticeable that those on lower incomes support burning. It is considered, by the majority who visit them, that a litter problem exists on local beaches. The majority of residents {{would like to see more}} rubbish bins around the city and are prepared to accept commercial sponsorship to achieve this. Less than half the local population identify hygene as being a basic reason for rubbish disposal. There is a low awareness of Civic Pride in Christchurch, however, there was a greater level of recognition of Civic Pride statements. There appears to be a communication problem between the public and various authorities which hopefully may be solved through the more efficient use of appropriate media. Those who are conscious of the environment do not vary greatly by age, occupation or income. However, those who are either apathetic or careless about their surroundings do have distinguishing characteristics. This group are between 22 000 and 38 000 in number and there is a predominance of them in certain suburbs. These are explained in more detail in Chapter 7. In order that programmes are planned and implemented with a greater level of success it is important to understand the characteristics of various target segments. One of the key functions in such programmes, and one which to date seems to have been less than effective, is communication. In order to assist in this area it is even more important to identify target segments and design and implement the most appropriate communications campaign...|$|E
