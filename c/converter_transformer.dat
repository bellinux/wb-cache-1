This paper presents an approach integrated with a two-dimensional cloud model and an entropy-based weight model to evaluate the condition of HVDC <b>converter</b> <b>transformers.</b> The integrated approach can describe the complexity of HVDC <b>converter</b> <b>transformers</b> and achieve an effective assessment of their condition.

50|$|Although at HVDC {{converter}} stations connected {{directly to}} power stations {{some of the}} reactive power may be provided by the generators themselves, {{in most cases the}} reactive power consumed by the converter must be provided by banks of shunt capacitors connected at the AC terminals of the converter.

5000|$|The <b>converter</b> <b>transformers</b> step up {{the voltage}} of the AC supply network. Using a star-to-delta or [...] "wye-delta" [...] {{connection}} of the <b>transformer</b> windings, the <b>converter</b> can operate with 12 pulses for each cycle in the AC supply, which eliminates numerous harmonic current components. The insulation of the transformer windings must be specially designed to withstand a large DC potential to earth. <b>Converter</b> <b>transformers</b> can be built as large as 300 megavolt-amperes (MW) as a single unit. It is impractical to transport larger transformers, so when larger ratings are required, several individual transformers are connected together. Either two three-phase units or three single-phase units can be used. With the latter variant only one type of transformer is used, making the supply of a spare transformer more economical.|$|R

50|$|Cahora Bassa {{was one of}} {{the first}} HVDC schemes built with {{thyristor}} valves from its inception. Unusually, the thyristor valves are outdoor mounted. In the original installation they were oil filled for both cooling and electrical insulation. The only other HVDC scheme in the world equipped in this way from the outset was the first phase - now decommissioned - of the Shin Shinano frequency converter in Japan. Each valve tank contains two valves, forming a double-valve connecting the two DC terminals to one single-phase, two-winding <b>converter</b> <b>transformer.</b> Each six-pulse bridge contains three such tanks and hence each station contains 24 double-valves.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the first}} bipole was {{completed}} in 1985, it became the world's largest HVDC system by both power transmission capacity and voltage, titles which it would hold for 25 years until the completion, in 2010, of the ±800 kV, 6400 MW HVDC link from Xiangjiaba Dam to Shanghai in China. It also contained important innovations in real-time control systems, {{being one of the}} first HVDC schemes to use digital control equipment using microprocessors. Nevertheless it suffered reliability problems in its first few years of operation, with numerous <b>converter</b> <b>transformer</b> failures and one serious converter fire, although reliability is now reported to be much improved.|$|E

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) {{behaviors of}} oil-paper insulation is distinctive in AC and DC combined electric fields in <b>converter</b> <b>transformers</b> from PD behaviors in pure AC or DC electric fields. The present study {{focuses on the}} PD developing processes and characteristics of oil-paper insulation systems with needle-plane defects under different AC/DC proportions. The degradation of oil-paper insulation can be accelerated by PD pulses incurred by needle-plane defects. AC-DC combined voltages are applied to the needle-plane defect model simultaneously in the established experimental platform, and the proportions of AC/DC voltages are decided according to the cases in actual <b>converter</b> <b>transformers.</b> The developing processes from the initiation of partial discharge until final breakdown were observed for each AC/DC proportion. PD parameters and patterns were acquired by a detector using the pulse current method. The test {{results indicate that the}} inception and breakdown voltages increase with the increase of the DC component in AC-DC combined voltages. However, pulse repetition rate and amplitude of PD shows a descending trend when AC/DC proportion decreases. Meanwhile, the PD recurrence rate in the phase between 180 ° and 360 ° becomes higher than that in the phase between 0 ° and 180 ° at the initial stage as the DC proportion increases; high-amplitude discharges mainly occur in the phase range between 180 ° and 360 ° when the pressboard is close to breakdown. The current study is useful in further research on fault diagnosis in <b>converter</b> <b>transformers...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{three-phase}} {{alternating current}} switch gear of a converter station {{is similar to}} that of an AC substation. It will contain circuit breakers for overcurrent protection of the <b>converter</b> <b>transformers,</b> isolating switches, grounding switches, and instrument transformers for control, measurement and protection. The station will also have lightning arresters for protection of the AC equipment from lightning surges on the AC system.|$|R
50|$|Line-commutated {{converters}} {{have some}} limitations {{in their use}} for HVDC systems. This results from requiring the AC circuit {{to turn off the}} thyristor current and the need {{for a short period of}} 'reverse' voltage to effect the turn-off (turn-off time). An attempt to address these limitations is the Capacitor-Commutated Converter (CCC) which has been used in a small number of HVDC systems. The CCC differs from a conventional HVDC system in that it has series capacitors inserted into the AC line connections, either on the primary or secondary side of the <b>converter</b> <b>transformer.</b> The series capacitors partially offset the commutating inductance of the converter and help to reduce fault currents. This also allows a smaller extinction angle to be used with a converter/inverter, reducing the need for reactive power support.However, CCC has remained only a niche application because of the advent of voltage-source converters (VSC) which completely eliminate the need for an extinction (turn-off) time.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} realize the {{industrialization}} of the new <b>converter</b> <b>transformer,</b> {{one of the important}} preconditions is to make matched protection scheme for the new <b>converter</b> <b>transformer.</b> The principle of differential protection for the new <b>converter</b> <b>transformer</b> is studied. Based on the analysis on the special windings wiring mode and turns ration relation of the new <b>converter</b> <b>transformer,</b> the relationship between bilateral currents of the new <b>converter</b> <b>transformer</b> are obtained, and two differential protection wiring schemes are thus proposed. The differential protection principle for the new converter transformers is tested under all operation conditions so as to compare the protection action characteristics. The results show that the differential protection scheme composed by subtraction of each two phase currents is better than the differential protection scheme based on the phase currents of primary side. The results can provide theoretical guide to the differential protection wiring scheme for the new <b>converter</b> <b>transformer</b> for actual engineering applications...|$|E

The valve winding of <b>converter</b> <b>transformer</b> needs to withstand the voltage that consist of DC voltage and serious distortion of AC voltages (harmonic bound) which are similar to the AC sine waveform compound voltage, so in the design and manufacture of the valve side of <b>converter</b> <b>transformer,</b> bushing is much more complex and difficult than alternating current casing. Valve bushing is weak spot of <b>converter</b> <b>transformer</b> insulation. Through the anatomy of failure bushing, the reason of bushing failure is analyzed.

50|$|<b>Converter</b> <b>transformers</b> for LCC HVDC schemes {{are quite}} {{specialised}} {{because of the}} high levels of harmonic currents which flow through them, and because the secondary winding insulation experiences a permanent DC voltage, which affects the design of the insulating structure (valve side requires more solid insulation) inside the tank.

The presence of homo-charges in the pressboards bulk and hetero-charges at the two interfaces between oil gap and pressboards leads to the electric field enhancement in the pressboards but reduction in the oil gap.
