50|$|In a 2010 media release, the Malaysian logging company Samling Global Ltd. was {{excluded}} from the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG). This decision was made on the recommendations from the Council of Ethics’ assessment that Samling Global, and two other companies, “are contributing to or are themselves responsible for grossily &#91;sic&#93; unethical activity”. The committee documented “extensive and repeated breaches of the licence requirements, regulations and other directives {{in all of the}} six concession areas that have been examined. Some of the violations constitute very serious transgressions, such as logging outside the concession area, logging in a protected area that {{was excluded}} from the <b>concession</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> in order to be integrated into an existing national park, and re-entry logging without Environmental Impact Assessments.” If more investors, finance institutions and timber traders worldwide follow suit and cut business ties with Samling Global, this could also make the Penan’s future a little brighter.|$|E

The mayor of the city of Aoujeft, Mohamed El Moctar Ould Ehmeyen Amar, resigned from the ruling party to politically support what he called [...] "the just cause of youngsters". In addition to the capital Noukchott, cities such as Atar, Zouerate, and Aleg also organised sporadic protests.

40|$|A history seminar {{paper on}} the {{political}} economy of the then Southern Rhodesia during the period 1898 to 1923. The role of the settlers has usually been overlooked or underestimated. The granting of the franchise to qualified persons in 1898 was in fact the outcome of a series of demands, public meetings, and representations to Rhodes, requesting the vote. Such demands had been ignored before 1896. The circumstances after the risings of 1896, {{in the face of the}} possible revocation of the Charter, caused Rhodes to propose settler representation on the Legislative Council to the Colonial Office, whose assent can be taken as recognition of the check this would provide on the Company's government, (l) The increases in the number of elective seats in the Council in 1902, 1907, and 1912 were similarly the outcome of popular demand, rather than gratuitous <b>concessions</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities.</b> In <b>the</b> elections of 1920, the success of the candidates supporting responsible government led to the referendum of 1922, and the earlier termination of Company rule than might otherwise have been expected at the end of its ten year period in 1924 or even later. These political demands and achievements, cannot, however, be seen in a purely political light, and can only be understood in terms of the economic situation in the country...|$|R
5000|$|In Prime Minister Olmert's own proposal, Israel would annex 6.3% [...] of the West Bank. The land in Olmert's map {{included}} the four settlements of Gush Etzion (with Efrat), Ma'ale Adumim, Giv'at Ze'ev, and Ariel, {{in addition to}} all settlements in East Jerusalem (Har Homa). In exchange for those <b>concessions</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Palestinian <b>Authority,</b> Olmert offered 5.8% [...] of Israeli land as part of the swap.

When Mahmoud Abbas asked to keep a copy of the map for further consideration, Ehud Olmert refused to comply. Mahmoud Abbas was forced to sketch Ehud Olmert's map by hand on a napkin to have a copy for further consideration. This map was then later referred to as the Napkin map.|$|R
50|$|The British had to {{deal with}} a {{conflicting}} demand that was rooted in Ottoman rule. Agreements for the supply of water, electricity, and the construction of a tramway system — all under <b>concessions</b> granted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman <b>authorities</b> — had been signed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> city of Jerusalem and a Greek citizen, Euripides Mavromatis, on 27 January 1914. Work under these concessions had not begun and, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of the war the British occupying forces refused to recognize their validity. Mavromatis claimed that his concessions overlapped with the Auja Concession that the government had awarded to Rutenberg in 1921 and that he had been deprived of his legal rights. The Mavromatis concession, in effect despite earlier British attempts to abolish it, covered Jerusalem and other localities (e.g., Bethlehem) within a radius of 20 km around the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.|$|R
2500|$|The {{language}} {{issue in}} the Transcaucasian republics revealed {{the sensitivity of the}} national problem in the region. The upsurge of the national movement in Georgia proper led to tensions between minorities as well, in particular with the Abkhaz, who interpreted <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Soviet <b>authorities</b> as a retreat in the face of Georgian nationalism and saw {{this as an opportunity to}} secede from Georgia. In May 1978, several thousands of Abkhaz nationalists assembled in the village of Lykhny to support 130 Abkhaz Communists, who had signed the letter to Moscow, demanding that the Abkhaz ASSR be allowed to be transferred from Georgia to the Russian SFSR. The Kremlin dispatched I.V. Kapitonov, secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee, to Sukhumi and installed a new party leader, , in Abkhazia. Kapitonov declared that secession was impermissible, but the government acknowledged the seriousness of <b>the</b> Abkhaz problem <b>by</b> decreeing a costly plan [...] "for the development of the economy and culture of the Abkhaz ASSR". An extra 500 million rubles were appropriated over seven years for economic investments such as a road-building program for infrastructure-poor Abkhazia, and cultural benefits such as the creation of an Abkhaz State University (with Abkhaz, Georgian, and Russian sectors), a State Folk Dance Ensemble in Sukhumi, and Abkhaz-language television broadcasting. Besides, ethnic quotas were established for certain bureaucratic posts, giving the Abkhaz a degree of political power that was disproportionate to their minority status in the autonomous republic.|$|R
40|$|The {{arrival of}} the Austro-Hungarian forces in Elbasan was not opposed <b>by</b> most of <b>the</b> patriots of the region, {{and those who had}} emigrated abroad for various reasons. Patriots in the region of Elbasan benefited from <b>the</b> <b>concessions</b> made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Austrian <b>authorities</b> in <b>the</b> {{interest}} of national movement. The economic situation in the region of Elbasan was still difficult. Besides the lack of grain, the biggest problem that existed at this time was speculations by some people who benefited from this difficult situation to be enriched by increasing grain prices. Poverty and economic collapse made it difficult living in this period, this condition had a negative impact on social morality, the health of the population and increasing mortality among the poor population. Austro-Hungarian authorities during this time took several actions to improve the situation but the misery was still present and food prices were not lowered. Austro-Hungarian authorities established in Elbasan and in several other cities military offices, which recruited Albanian soldiers, who were led by Austrian officers. Austro-Hungarian authorities undertook action to disarm <b>the</b> local population <b>by</b> collecting all <b>the</b> weapons in the region of Elbasan. During this time the Austro-Hungarians built a post office in the city of Elbasan, also raises an Austrian trading agency in the city of Elbasan to promote trade in this region...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{comprises}} an introduction, four parts, and conclusions. The introduction char- acterizes {{the fundamental}} notions {{discussed in the}} paper, namely kin selection, nepotism, cronyism and political capitalism. The {{first part of the}} paper concerns kin selection and reciprocal altruism, which are deemed to be the fundamental mechanisms of socialization. This part indicates that nepotism has a biological justification (and in R. Dawkins’ interpretation – a genetic justification). The mechanisms of kin selection and reciprocal altruism raise the question of whether nepotism is not a natural phenomenon in humans. If so, this means that the negative assessment of these phenomena of public life goes against natural human inclinations. The second part of the paper refers to the origins of the notion of nepotism and to a particu- lar understanding of the public realm in modern democracies. The development of democracy has been related to the transformation of the mechanisms of governance which consisted in <b>concessions</b> made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> to those demanding changes. Political struggle has been minimized as it was directed at competition among citizens. The struggle for the change of power has been replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> struggle for access to positions and goods in the public realm. Axiological justification has been provided by social justice as a claim for equal access to goods by virtue of principles of transparency. The third part of the paper discusses the issue of nepotism and cronyism in public opinion. It refers to the results of public opinion surveys concerning, among other things, favoritism, ways of looking for jobs, unequal opportunities on account of social status, and the social sta- tus of the family. Additionally, selected examples of nepotism and favoritism in political life are presented. The fourth part deals with the issue of political capitalism both in the interpretation of M. Weber and as a phenomenon of the transition of the Polish socio-political system. Political capitalism can be defined in a nutshell as using state structures or political positions for an un- fair distribution of goods and is expressed by muddy links between the representatives of state with the private business sphere...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of buildings holding baths along the Spanish seashore, not only supposed an enjoyment for affluent people but {{was a way of}} generating a new tourist landscape. The golden age of Spanish balneotherapy took place around the last third of the nineteenth century. Many sea bath structures were built at the Spanish Levante, but they have all now disappeared. Inside these constructions there were coffee-shops, theaters and casinos. People used to go there looking for therapeutic or medicinal healing, and also to find a place where they could forget their problems and daily routine. This research paper is part of a project conducted at the University of Alicante, and its main target has been to find historical documentation about these Mediterranean seashore buildings (Alicante and Murcia) in order to accomplish a cataloging that allowed us to study these architecture typologies. All the historical maps and plans, drawings and photographs used in our paper, not only offer us a romantic vision, they also convey a whole process of systematized execution. The construction system can be divided into permanent and removable structures. This removable feature and the simplicity of assembly were achieved thanks to the precarious <b>concession</b> carried out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> at <b>the</b> maritime area. This paper shows the study of different architectural, structural and constructive solutions implanted in each one of these typologies characterized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> use of fixed and removable lightweight structures and the evolution of piling systems...|$|R
