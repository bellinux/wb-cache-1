40|$|Deterioration or need to {{increase}} the load bearing capacity of bridge decks requiresthe strengthening of the decks {{by the addition of}} new elements. Placing reinforcedconcrete layers to strengthen or repair and strengthen concrete bridge decks on the compressionor the tension side of the element is a normal construction practice. However, there aremany unresolved issues regarding the capacity and the interface behaviour between the existingdeck and the new layer of the strengthened elements especially under seismic actions. Thenew deck created is a reinforced concrete composite member. In the present study an analyticalmodel has been developed for the estimation of the ultimate strength of such a compositedeck. The shear stress at the interface of the function results from experimental data and dependson the <b>connecting</b> <b>means.</b> The influence of cyclic loading on the behaviour of the interfacebetween the new concrete layer and the existing deck is considered. The model iscomplemented by a computer program in order to facilitate the relative calculations. Finally,an analytical procedure for the structural design and detailing of strengthened or repairedand strengthened bridge decks by the addition of new concrete is proposed. Moreover the inducedshear stresses and forces at the interface can be assessed to design the necessary connectionmeans, in order {{that there will be no}} failure of the contact interface, before theretrofitted deck reaches its flexural capacity...|$|E
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} stochasticity of {{gene expression}} {{can lead to}} large variability in protein levels for genetically identical cells. Such variability in protein levels can arise from infrequent synthesis of mRNAs which in turn give rise to bursts of protein expression. Protein expression occurring in bursts has indeed been observed experimentally and recent studies have also found evidence for transcriptional bursting, i. e. production of mRNAs in bursts. Given that there are distinct experimental techniques for quantifying the noise {{at different stages of}} gene expression, it is of interest to derive analytical results connecting experimental observations at different levels. In this work, we consider stochastic models of gene expression for which mRNA and protein production occurs in independent bursts. For such models, we derive analytical expressions connecting protein and mRNA burst distributions which show how the functional form of the mRNA burst distribution can be inferred from the protein burst distribution. Additionally, if gene expression is repressed such that observed protein bursts arise only from single mRNAs, we show how observations of protein burst distributions (repressed and unrepressed) can be used to completely determine the mRNA burst distribution. Assuming independent contributions from individual bursts, we derive analytical expressions <b>connecting</b> <b>means</b> and variances for burst and steady-state protein distributions. Finally, we validate our general analytical results by considering a specific reaction scheme involving regulation of protein bursts by small RNAs. For a range of parameters, we derive analytical expressions for regulated protein distributions that are validated using stochastic simulations. The analytical results obtained in this work can thus serve as useful inputs for a broad range of studies focusing on stochasticity in gene expression...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{calculate}} {{the mean number}} of metastable states for spin glasses on so called random thin graphs with couplings taken from a symmetric binary distribution ± J. Thin graphs are graphs where the local connectivity of each site is fixed to some value c. As in totally <b>connected</b> <b>mean</b> field models we find that the number of metastable states increases exponentially with the system size. Furthermore we find that the average number of metastable states decreases as c in agreement with previous studies showing that finite connectivity corrections of order 1 /c increase the number of metastable states with respect to the totally <b>connected</b> <b>mean</b> field limit. We also prove that the average number of metastable states in the limit c→∞ is finite and converges to the average number of metastable states in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. An annealed calculation for the number of metastable states N_MS(E) of energy E is also carried out giving a lower bound on the ground state energy of these spin glasses. For small c one may obtain analytic expressions for. Comment: 13 pages LateX, 3 figures. ep...|$|R
