25|$|In {{addition}} to the plastic card, each holder of a Bulgarian driving licence is in a possession of a second document, named check <b>counterfoil</b> (контролен талон). It is made of blue paper, is filled in by hand and is stamped. When a driver is fined for road violation, the <b>counterfoil</b> is taken by the authorities and is replaced by а breech act (акт за нарушение). The driver may continue driving for a limited period of time, stated in the document. The check <b>counterfoil</b> is returned back only after the fine is paid.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with his beliefs, {{he and his}} wife also ran a small temperance hotel above the office. Their business model was refined by the introduction of the 'hotel coupon' in 1868. Detachable coupons in a <b>counterfoil</b> book were issued to the traveller. These were valid for either a restaurant meal or an overnight hotel stay provided they were on Cook's list.|$|E

He added that the characters' {{relationship}} would be tense and complex; their background and the reasoning behind Ziva's animosity towards the new Mossad director would be explained in the final scenes. Sirtis described her character's relationship with Ziva as electric, explaining that she saw Orli as a <b>counterfoil</b> to Ziva's intensity and drive for vengeance. Their history, she believed, is [...] "kind of mind-blowing"; it provides an explanation for subplots introduced earlier in the episode. She clarified that Director Elbaz would not be a [...] "shrinking flower": [...] "She's kickass. She's strong. She's manipulative. She uses every weapon in her female arsenal. These parts for middle-aged women in Hollywood do not come along very often. I'm thrilled that the producers of the show were brave enough to cast a woman in this role. They're prepared to take risks. It's a big gamble." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1954, Steve Roper artist Pete Hoffman {{was leaving}} {{to do his}} own strip, Jeff Cobb. Overgard [...] "had {{been trying to get}} a {{syndicated}} gig, and when the Roper job opened up, he was invited to compete with other candidates for the assignment. 'Fortunately,' he wrote, 'I managed to scoot by and win, and {{that was the beginning of}} my career as a strip cartoonist.'" [...] The first strip he drew for Steve Roper was for July 12, 1954. When the writer, Allen Saunders, was considering a <b>counterfoil</b> pal for [...] "straight-arrow" [...] Roper, Overgard suggested a character he had been working on and described as [...] "a realistic working-man kind of guy who was not beyond taking any opportunity that presented itself". Thus appeared on June 19, 1956, Mike Nomad, who would ultimately become the protagonist of the strip.|$|E

60|$|At {{the end of}} {{that time}} our {{fortnightly}} pass-book came in from the bank in London. It is part of my duty, as the millionaire's secretary, to make up this book once a fortnight, and to compare the cancelled cheques with Sir Charles's <b>counterfoils.</b> On this particular occasion I happened to observe what I can only describe as a very grave discrepancy,--in fact, a discrepancy of 5000 pounds. On the wrong side, too. Sir Charles was debited with 5000 pounds more than the total amount that was shown on the <b>counterfoils.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Lagune {{produced}} some keys {{and got out}} his cheque book. He turned over the <b>counterfoils.</b> [...] "There's nothing wrong here," [...] he said, and handed the book to Lewisham.|$|R

6000|$|... “Of course, I {{have thought}} of that,” said Egbert; “every present that was sent off would be {{accompanied}} by a ticket bearing the date of dispatch and the signature of the sender, and some conventional hieroglyphic to show that it was intended to be a Christmas or New Year gift; there would be a <b>counterfoil</b> with space for the recipient’s name and the date of arrival, and all you would have to do would be to sign and date the <b>counterfoil,</b> add a conventional hieroglyphic indicating heartfelt thanks and gratified surprise, put the thing into an envelope and post it.” ...|$|E

6000|$|He handed {{back the}} book to Lagune, open at the blank <b>counterfoil</b> of a cheque that had been removed. Lagune stared and passed {{his hand over his}} {{forehead}} in a confused way. [...] "I can't see this," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Weatherley {{remained}} {{for a moment}} in the chair where she had left him, gazing idly at the <b>counterfoil</b> of the cheque. Then he rose and from a safe point of vantage watched the car drive off. With slow, leaden footsteps he returned to his seat. It was past his own regular luncheon hour, but he made no movement to leave the place.|$|E
40|$|The {{records of}} death {{that had been}} {{certified}} by general practitioners in one practice over 18 years were assessed {{in the light of}} the recent joint publications of the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Pathologists. Over this period roughly 30 % of the deaths in the practice population occurred outside hospital and a total of 262 certificates were issued. A review of 262 <b>counterfoils</b> of records of death certification showed that 12 <b>counterfoils</b> (4. 6 %) had no age and sex mentioned, and three <b>counterfoils</b> did not describe the place of death. The average age at death outside hospital was 71. 6 years [...] the age of women being 75. 1 years compared with that of men of 68. 2 years. Only 2 % of patients had had a necropsy. The common causes of death stated in the certificates were: cardiovascular 41 %, carcinoma 35 %, respiratory 15 %, and stroke 8 %. All contributory causes are also mentioned. Ninety seven per cent of the patients were seen after death by the doctors in the practice and 68 % had been seen in the two days preceding death. We emphasise the importance of keeping accurate records of deaths in general practice for audit and research as well as for planning services for terminally ill and recently bereaved patients...|$|R
50|$|Individuals or firms {{wishing to}} use a carnet to move goods {{in and out of}} foreign {{countries}} must submit an application and the necessary collateral to their home national guaranteeing organization. The application, among other things, lists all countries of intended transit and all applicable goods with their assigned values. If the application is properly completed and submitted with the applicable fees the national guaranteeing organization will issue a carnet specifically tailored to that itinerary. The carnet document has two green cover pages denoting country of origin with instructions. Within the covers are <b>counterfoils</b> and vouchers for each country to be visited or transited. The vouchers act as receipts for entry and re-export in foreign countries and are kept by foreign customs officials. The <b>counterfoils</b> are stamped by the foreign customs services and act as the carnet holders receipt.|$|R
60|$|There {{was only}} one little thing {{at the back of}} her mind that alloyed her sense of happy and {{complete}} living that night, and that was the ghost of an addition sum.

6000|$|... "No, no; {{not quite}} so. It isn't like that. You mistake the situation. We're both cheques equally, {{and neither is}} a <b>counterfoil.</b> Cyril and I depend for our characters, as {{everybody}} else does, upon our father and mother and our remoter progenitors.

50|$|At {{the time}} of the Sweepstake's inception, lotteries were {{generally}} illegal in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.

60|$|THE JUDGE. [Bending {{a little}} towards the jury, and {{speaking}} in a business-like voice] Gentlemen, you have heard the evidence, and the comments on it. My only business is to make clear to you the issues you have to try. The facts are admitted, {{so far as the}} alteration of this cheque and <b>counterfoil</b> by the prisoner. The defence set up is that he was not in a responsible condition when he committed the crime. Well, you have heard the prisoner's story, and the evidence of the other witnesses--so far as it bears on the point of insanity. If you think that what you have heard establishes the fact that the prisoner was insane {{at the time of the}} forgery, you will find him guilty, but insane. If, on the other hand, you conclude from what you have seen and heard that the prisoner was sane--and nothing short of insanity will count--you will find him guilty. In reviewing the testimony as to his mental condition you must bear in mind very carefully the evidence as to his demeanour and conduct both before and after the act of forgery--the evidence of the prisoner himself, of the woman, of the witness--er--COKESON, and--er--of the cashier. And in regard to that I especially direct your attention to the prisoner's admission that the idea of adding the 'ty' and the nought did come into his mind at the moment when the cheque was handed to him; and also to the alteration of the <b>counterfoil,</b> and to his subsequent conduct generally. The bearing of all this on the question of premeditation [and premeditation will imply sanity] is very obvious. You must not allow any considerations of age or temptation to weigh with you in the finding of your verdict. Before you can come to a verdict of guilty but insane you must be well and thoroughly convinced that the condition of his mind was such as would have qualified him at the moment for a lunatic asylum. [He pauses, then, seeing that the jury are doubtful whether to retire or no, adds:] You may retire, gentlemen, if you wish to do so.|$|E

All this country that I passed over to-night is as flat and clean as the palm of your hand, and the man we are following is no fool, as he very clearly showed to-night. I have wired to Overton to let us know any fresh London developments at this address, and in the meantime we can only concentrate our attention upon Dr. Armstrong, whose name the obliging young lady at the office allowed me to read upon the <b>counterfoil</b> of Staunton's urgent message. He knows where the young man is--to that I'll swear, and if he knows, then it must be our own fault if we cannot manage to know also. At present it must be admitted that the odd trick is in his possession, and, as you are aware, Watson, it is not my habit to leave the game in that condition." ...|$|E
