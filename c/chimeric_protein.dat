40|$|All {{retrovirus}} glycoproteins have a cytoplasmic domain {{that plays}} several roles in virus replication. We have determined {{whether and how}} the cytoplasmic domains of oncoretrovirus glycoproteins modulate their intracellular trafficking, by using <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> that combined the α-chain of the interleukin- 2 receptor with the glycoprotein cytoplasmic domains of five oncoretroviruses: human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1), Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), bovine leukemia virus (BLV), murine leukemia virus (MuLV), and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV). All of these proteins were synthesized and matured {{in the same way}} as a control protein with no retrovirus cytoplasmic domain. However, the amounts of all <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> at the cell surface were smaller than that of the control protein. The protein appearing at and leaving the cell surface and endocytosis were measured in stable transfectants expressing the chimera. We identified two groups of proteins which followed distinct intracellular pathways. Group 1 included <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> that reached the cell surface normally but were rapidly endocytosed afterwards. This group included the <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> with HTLV- 1, RSV, and BLV cytoplasmic domains. Group 2 included <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> that were not detected at the cell surface, despite normal intracellular concentrations, and were accumulated in the Golgi complex. This group included the <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> with MuLV and MPMV cytoplasmic domains. Finally, we verified that the MuLV envelope glycoproteins behaved {{in the same way as}} the corresponding chimeras. These results indicate that retroviruses have evolved two distinct mechanisms to ensure a similar biological feature: low concentrations of their glycoproteins at the cell surface...|$|R

More recently, with the use of genetic engineering tools developed for these organisms, this use has expanded for the production of nonnative heterologous proteins. In this review, an overview is given of examples describing the production of a special class of these <b>proteins,</b> namely <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins.</b> The production of two types of <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> have been explored: (a) proteins grafted for a specific substrate-binding domain and (b) fusion proteins containing two separate enzymatic activities.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a strategy for the identification of peptides able to functionally replace a zinc finger domain in a transcription factor. This strategy could have important ramifications for basic research on gene regulation and {{for the development of}} therapeutic agents. In this study in yeast, we expressed <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> that included a random peptide combinatorial library in association with two zinc finger domains and a transactivating domain. The library was screened for <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> capable of activating transcription from a target sequence in the upstream regulatory regions of selectable or reporter genes. In a screen of approximately 1. 5 × 107 transformants we identified 30 <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> that exhibited transcriptional activation, some of which were able to discriminate between wild-type and mutant DNA targets. <b>Chimeric</b> library <b>proteins</b> expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusions bound to double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the target sequence, suggesting that the chimeras bind directly to DNA.

40|$|Membrane-tethered {{proteins}} (mammalian surface display) {{are increasingly}} being used for novel therapeutic and biotechnology applications. Maximizing surface expression of <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> on mammalian cells is important for these applications. We show that the cytoplasmic domain from the B 7 - 1 antigen, a commonly used element for mammalian surface display, can enhance the intracellular transport and surface display of <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> in a Sar 1 and Rab 1 dependent fashion. However, mutational, alanine scanning and deletion analysis demonstrate the absence of linear ER export motifs in the B 7 cytoplasmic domain. Rather, efficient intracellular transport correlated {{with the presence of}} predicted secondary structure in the cytoplasmic tail. Examination of the cytoplasmic domains of 984 human and 782 mouse type I transmembrane proteins revealed that many previously identified ER export motifs are rarely found in the cytoplasmic tail of type I transmembrane proteins. Our results suggest that efficient intracellular transport of B 7 <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> is associated with the structure rather than to the presence of a linear ER export motif in the cytoplasmic tail, and indicate that short (less than ~ 10 - 20 amino acids) and unstructured cytoplasmic tails should be avoided to express high levels of <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> on mammalian cells...|$|R
40|$|Transport of yeast {{alkaline}} phosphatase (ALP) to the vacuole {{depends on the}} clathrin adaptor-like complex AP- 3, but {{does not depend on}} proteins necessary for transport through pre-vacuolar endosomes. We have identified ALP sequences that direct sorting into the AP- 3 -dependent pathway using <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> containing residues from the ALP cytoplasmic domain fused to sequences from a Golgi-localized membrane protein, guanosine diphosphatase (GDPase). The full-length ALP cytoplasmic domain, or ALP amino acids 1 - 16 separated from the transmembrane domain by a spacer, directed GDPase <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> from the Golgi complex to the vacuole via the AP- 3 pathway. Mutation of residues Leu 13 and Val 14 within the ALP cytoplasmic domain prevented AP- 3 -dependent vacuolar transport of both <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> and full-length ALP. This Leucine-Valine (LV) -based sorting signal targeted <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> and native ALP to the vacuole in cells lacking clathrin function. These results identify an LV-based sorting signal in the ALP cytoplasmic domain that directs transport into a clathrin-independent, AP- 3 -dependent pathway to the vacuole. The similarity of the ALP sorting signal to mammalian dileucine sorting motifs, and the evolutionary conservation of AP- 3 subunits, suggests that dileucine-like signals constitute a core element for AP- 3 -dependent transport to lysosomal compartments in all eukaryotic cells...|$|R

50|$|Prions {{are formed}} by portable, {{transmissible}} prion domains that are enriched in asparagine, glutamine, tyrosine and glycine residues. When a reporter protein is fused with a prion domain, {{it forms a}} <b>chimeric</b> <b>protein</b> that demonstrates the conformational switching that is characteristic of prions. Meanwhile, removing this prion domain prevents prionogenesis. This suggests that these prion domains are, in fact, portable and are the sole initiatior of prionogenesis.

40|$|Complexes {{comprised}} of IGF-I, IGF-binding proteins and the ECM protein vitronectin (VN) stimulate cell migration and growth and can replace {{the requirement for}} serum for the ex vivo expansion of cells, as well as promote wound healing in vivo. Moreover, {{the activity of the}} complexes is dependent on co-activation of the IGF-I receptor and VN-binding integrins. In view of this we sought to develop <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> able to recapitulate the action of the multiprotein complex within a single molecular species. We report here the production of two recombinant <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins,</b> incorporating domains of VN linked to IGF-I, which mimic the functions of the complex. Further, the activity of the <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> is dependent on co-activation of the IGF-I- and VN-binding cell surface receptors.

40|$|Polyclonal {{antibodies}} (PAb) {{were raised}} against an aflatoxigenic strain of Aspergillus parasiticus by using two different sources for antibody elicitation: (i) filtrate {{of a culture}} on which the fungus had been grown (ii) and two <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins,</b> expressed in Escherichia coli as separate products, of the genes ver- 1 and apa- 2, which are involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis. The gene products were amplified by PCR, and each was cloned into the E. coli expression vector pGEX 2 T. Upon induction, the bacteria overexpressed 38 - and 33 -kDa <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> corresponding to the N-terminal domains of the genes ver- 1 and apa- 2, respectively. The <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> were isolated and affinity purified for use as antigens. The specificity of the raised antibodies was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The PAbs raised against the culture filtrate reacted with all the species of Aspergillus and Penicillium tested but not with Fusarium species or corn gain. However, the PAbs elicited against the <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> were highly specific, showing significantly higher ELISA absorbance values (A 405) against A. parasiticus and A. flavus than against the other fungi tested and the corn grain. The approach of utilizing gene products associated with aflatoxin biosynthesis for antibody production therefore appears to be feasible. Such a multiantibody system combined with the PCR technique, could provide {{a useful tool for}} the rapid, sensitive, and accurate detection of aflatoxin producers present in grains and foods...|$|R

50|$|Affinity tags {{have been}} widely used to purify {{recombinant}} proteins, as they allow the accumulation of recombinant protein with little impurities. However, the affinity tag must be removed by proteases in the final purification step. The extra proteolysis step raises the problems of protease specificity in removing affinity tags from recombinant protein, and the removal of the digestion product. This problem can be avoided by fusing an affinity tag to self-cleavable inteins in a controlled environment. The first generation of expression vectors of this kind used modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae VMA (Sce VMA) intein. Chong et al. used a chitin binding domain (CBD) from Bacillus circulans as an affinity tag, and fused this tag with a modified Sce VMA intein. The modified intein undergoes a self-cleavage reaction at its N-terminal peptide linkage with 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), or cystine at low temperatures over a broad pH range. After expressing the recombinant protein, the cell homogenate is passed through the column containing chitin. This allows the CBD of the <b>chimeric</b> <b>protein</b> to bind to the column. Furthermore, when the temperature is lowered and the molecules described above pass through the column, the <b>chimeric</b> <b>protein</b> undergoes self-splicing and only the target protein is eluted. This novel technique eliminates the need for a proteolysis step, and modified Sce VMA stays in column attached to chitin through CBD.|$|E
40|$|Human {{heat shock}} factor 1 (HSF 1) stimulates {{transcription}} from {{heat shock protein}} genes following stress. We have used <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> containing the GAL 4 DNA binding domain to identify the transcriptional activation domains of HSF 1 and a separate domain {{that is capable of}} regulating activation domain function. This regulatory domain conferred heat shock inducibility to <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> containing the activation domains. The regulatory domain is located between the transcriptional activation domains and the DNA binding domain of HSF 1 and is conserved between mammalian and chicken HSF 1 but is not found in HSF 2 or HSF 3. The regulatory domain was found to be functionally homologous between chicken and human HSF 1. This domain does not affect DNA binding by the <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> and does not contain any of the sequences previously postulated to regulate DNA binding of HSF 1. Thus, we suggest that activation of HSF 1 by stress in humans is controlled by two regulatory mechanisms that separately confer heat shock-induced DNA binding and transcriptional stimulation...|$|R

Dorfin is a ubiquitin ligase (E 3) that degrades mutant SOD 1 proteins, which are responsible for familial ALS. Although Dorfin has potential as an anti-ALS molecule, its life in cells is short. To improve its stability and enhance its E 3 activity, we developed <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> containing the substrate-binding hydrophobic portion of Dorfin and the U-box domain of the carboxyl terminus of Hsc 70 -interacting protein (CHIP), which has strong E 3 activity through the U-box domain.

Whole-cell T. cruzi extracts or recombinant proteins have shown variation in the performance and cross-reactivity. Synthetic <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> comprising fragments of repetitive amino acids of several different proteins have been shown to improve assay performances to detect Chagasic infections. Here, we describe the production of four <b>chimeric</b> T. cruzi <b>proteins</b> and the assessment of their performance for diagnostic purposes. Circular Dichroism spectra indicated the absence of well-defined secondary structures, while polydispersity evaluated by Dynamic Light Scattering revealed only minor aggregates in 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate (pH 9. 6), demonstrating that it is an appropriate buffering system for sensitizing microplates. Serum samples from T. cruzi-infected and non-infected individuals were used to assess the {{performance of}} these antigens for detecting antibodies against T. cruzi, using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a liquid bead array platform.

5000|$|Many <b>chimeric</b> <b>protein</b> {{drugs are}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies whose specificity for a target molecule was developed using mice and hence were initially [...] "mouse" [...] antibodies. As non-human proteins, mouse antibodies tend to evoke an immune reaction if administered to humans.

For example, human constant domains can be introduced, thereby eliminating most of the potentially immunogenic portions of the drug without altering its specificity for the intended therapeutic target. Antibody nomenclature indicates this type of modification by inserting -xi- into the non-proprietary name (e.g., abci-xi-mab). If parts of the variable domains are also replaced by human portions, humanized antibodies are obtained. Although not conceptually distinct from chimeras, this type is indicated using -zu- such as in dacli-zu-mab. See the list of monoclonal antibodies for more examples.|$|E
40|$|Targeting of transmembrane {{proteins}} to lysosomes, endosomal compartments, or the trans-Golgi {{network is}} largely dependent upon cytoplasmically exposed sorting signals. Among {{the most widely}} used signals are those that conform to the tyrosine-based motif, YXXO (where Y is tyrosine, X is any amino acid, and O is an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic group), and to the di-leucine (or LL) motif. Signals conforming to both motifs have been implicated in protein localization to similar post-Golgi compartments. We have exploited the saturability of sorting to ask whether different YXXO or LL signals use shared components of the targeting machinery. <b>Chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> containing various cytoplasmic domains and/or targeting signals were overexpressed in HeLa cells by transient transfection. Endogenous transferrin receptor and lysosomal proteins accumulated at the cell surface upon overexpression of <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> containing functional YXXO targeting signals, regardless of the compartmental destination imparted by the signal. Furthermore, overexpression of these <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> compromised YXXO-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal delivery. These activities were ablated by mutating the signals or by appending sequences that conformed to the YXXO motif but lacked targeting activity. Interestingly, overexpression of <b>chimeric</b> <b>proteins</b> containing cytoplasmic LL signals failed to induce surface displacement of endogenous YXXO-containing proteins, but did displace other proteins containing LL motifs. Our data demonstrate that: (a) Protein targeting and internalization mediated by either YXXO or LL motifs are saturable processes; (b) common saturable components are used in YXXO-mediated protein internalization and targeting to different post-Golgi compartments; and (c) YXXO- and LL-mediated targeting mechanisms use distinct saturable components...|$|R
