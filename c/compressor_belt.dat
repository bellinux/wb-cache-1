40|$|Particle therapy (PT) {{has shown}} {{positive}} therapeutic results in local control of locally advanced pancreatic lesions. PT effectiveness is highly influenced by target localization accuracy both in space, since the pancreas {{is located in}} proximity to radiosensitive vital organs, and in time as it is subject to substantial breathing-related motion. The purpose of this preliminary study was to quantify pancreas range of motion under typical PT treatment conditions. Three common immobilization devices (vacuum cushion, thermoplastic mask, and <b>compressor</b> <b>belt)</b> were evaluated on five male patients in prone and supine positions. Retrospective four-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging data were reconstructed for each condition and the pancreas was manually segmented on each of six breathing phases. A k-means algorithm was then applied on the manually segmented map {{in order to obtain}} clusters representative of the three pancreas segments: head, body, and tail. Centers of mass (COM) for the pancreas and its segments were computed, as well as their displacements with respect to a reference breathing phase (beginning exhalation). The median three-dimensional COM displacements were in the range of 3 mm. Latero-lateral and superior-inferior directions had a higher range of motion than the anterior-posterior direction. Motion analysis of the pancreas segments showed slightly lower COM displacements for the head cluster compared to the tail cluster, especially in prone position. Statistically significant differences were found within patients among the investigated setups. Hence a patient-specific approach, rather than a general strategy, is suggested to define the optimal treatment setup in the frame of a millimeter positioning accuracy...|$|E
5000|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} National Transportation Safety Board and attributed {{to the failure of}} a <b>compressor</b> drive <b>belt</b> supplying air to the brakes on the aging vehicle and inexperience and negligence {{on the part of the}} bus driver. Various aspects of the ramp itself, including the severe radius of the curvature of the ramp and lack of warning signs, were also cited as contributing factors. [...] The NTSB also noted that the {{accident was}} at that time the worst school bus crash and the worst highway disaster since the agency was created in 1967.|$|R
40|$|An {{end-of-life}} prediction system {{developed for}} electric machines and their loads {{could be used}} in integrated vehicle health monitoring at NASA and in other government agencies. This system will provide on-line, real-time condition assessment and end-of-life prediction of electric machines (e. g., motors, generators) and/or their loads of mechanically coupled machinery (e. g., pumps, fans, <b>compressors,</b> turbines, conveyor <b>belts,</b> magnetic levitation trains, and others). In long-duration space flight, the ability to predict the lifetime of machinery could spell the difference between mission success or failure. Therefore, the system described here may be of inestimable value to the U. S. space program. The system will provide continuous monitoring for on-line condition assessment and end-of-life prediction as opposed to the current off-line diagnoses...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{to evaluate the}} energy consumption of an automotive air conditioning is presented. In this study, these refrigerants will be tested using the experimental rig which simulated the actual cars as a cabin complete with a cooling system component of the actual car that is as the blower, evaporator, condenser, radiators, electric motor, which acts as a vehicle engine, and then the electric motor will operate the <b>compressor</b> using a <b>belt</b> and pulley system, {{as well as to}} the alternator will recharge the battery. The compressor working with the fluids HFC- 134 a and HC- 134 a and has been tested varying the speed in the range 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 rpm. The measurements taken during the one hour experimental periods at 2 -minutes interval times for temperature setpoint of 20 Â°C with internal heat loads 0, 500, 700 and 1000 W. The final results of this study show an overall better energy consumption of the HFC- 134 a compared with the HC- 134 a...|$|R
40|$|The {{refrigeration}} units currently used in road transport vehicles are predominantly of the vapour com-pression refrigeration (VCR) type. In such a unit, the compressor requires an input {{of energy in}} the form of work. Although in smaller systems, the <b>compressor</b> can be <b>belt</b> driven from the main propulsion engine, in large systems, it is normally driven by a dedicated internal combustion (IC) engine. In order to obtain re-frigeration, the use of vapour absorption refrigeration (VAR) systems utilising the waste heat in the exhaust gases from the main propulsion unit of the vehicle was experimentally investigated and proved possible. Hence, {{there is no need for}} the IC engine and compressor of the VCR system. Money can therefore be saved, and there is a reduction in the weight of the unit. Additionally, the VAR system runs quietly and is almost maintenance-free, and the primary energy used to drive the independent engine of the VCR system can be saved. The study included and experimental investigation into the eect on the performance of the IC engine of introducing the VAR system into the exhaust system and also the provision of appropriate o-road/slow running cooling systems, in order to take account of the reduction in exhaust gas flow in slow running trac or stationary situations or when the vehicle is parked and cooling is still required...|$|R
40|$|Coal fired {{power plants}} {{are one of}} the main {{contributors}} in power generation in the world and it is nearly 40 % of global power generation. When considering power generation in Sri Lanka, Puttalam Coal Power Plant is the largest and one and only coal fired power plant. Presently 900 MW is produced by three units of this power plant. Coal fired power plants consume a considerable amount of energy as the home load. For example, many auxiliary systems such as pumping, cooling, coal handling, compressed air, HVAC and lighting. In the coal fired power plants in Sri Lanka, they account for 90 MW, which results in the supply of only 810 MW to the grid out of the produced 900 MW. The majority of auxiliary systems consist of electric motors as prime movers for pumps, <b>compressors,</b> conveyor <b>belts</b> and coal mills. The electricity generator is coupled with a steam turbine that uses the generated steam in the boilers. This system needs prime movers and that consumes the most amount of electricity, which is generated. By reducing the home load in an efficient and a strategic manner, the power plant efficiency could be increased and more power can be supplied to the grid. However, the implementation of these changes for a power plant, which has already been constructed and operational, is difficult. Although it is a difficult attempt, it is worthwhile to explore the possibility to implement changes in the existing coal power plants. It could potentially yield positive results and incur savings. This study has looked into ways to minimise the home load and propose alternative renewable energy options for the coal power plants. The research goes on to develop a method to recommend alternative energy options to address the home load needs of coal power plants. In order to evaluate this method, it has been applied to the Norochcholai power plant and to recommend the most suitable energy option to account for the home load. The results suggest that the developed method provides guidance to practitioners to decide the energy efficiency and renewable energy options to address the home load of coal fired power plants. It is suggested to further develop this method as a computer based software program in the future...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of natural}} {{coloring}} essence {{has been replaced by}} sintetic coloring. Since the result of the natural coloring is in the liqud form that makes it difficult to be applied and it is less practice. This liquid coloring is dryed into powder with a spray dryer. The aim of this final asigment is to design and to make a coloring spray dryer and to know how this tool works.
