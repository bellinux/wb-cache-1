That is, whenever an {{email address is}} presented for subscription to the list, the list software should send a <b>confirmation</b> <b>message</b> to that address. The <b>confirmation</b> <b>message</b> contains no advertising content, {{so it is not}} construed to be spam itself — and the address is not added to the live mail list unless the recipient responds to the <b>confirmation</b> <b>message.</b> See also the Spamhaus Mailing Lists vs. Spam Lists page.|$|E

Such cancellation messages pose no security risk to the regular EMV payment application, but can be cryptographically verified and are generated by an EMV card only after the correct PIN has been entered.

40|$|The {{dissemination}} of disaster early warning messages {{has a significant}} role in the effectiveness and serviceability in an Early Warning System (EWS). Providing the community in a disaster area with an adequate dissemination and communication of early warning messages will improve people's awareness and reaction to a natural hazard. People who live in a disaster area play a crucial role in the success of EWS. Malaysian, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi and Indonesian authorities employ mobile phone applications, such as text messages (SMS), as a tool for disaster warning messages. However, there are many challenges in methods for disseminating early warning messages. One of the challenges is the dissemination method in which only notification messages are sent. In this paper, we propose <b>confirmation</b> or verification <b>messages,</b> as part of disaster early warning messages, by using text <b>messages.</b> <b>Confirmation</b> <b>messages</b> are messages that use a verification channel to provide up-to- date official information about the latest natural disaster conditions.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{selective}} aperiodic checkpointing approach for VLR (Visitor Location Register) failure restoration in wireless mobile networks. In this approach, the VLR data are backed {{up in the}} non-volatile storage whenever the location update counter for that VLR exceeds the pre-determined threshold. It restores the backed up VLR data after {{the failure of the}} VLR and sends location <b>confirmation</b> request <b>messages</b> only to the selected Registration Areas (RAs) whose information is updated between the time period of back up and failure of the VLR. This is necessary as this information is obsolete in the backed up VLR for this reason and needs to be updated in the restored VLR. However, previous work on aggressive restoration based on periodic and aperiodic checkpointing also provide solutions for VLR database failure recovery. But these solutions are not feasible as they broadcast the location <b>confirmation</b> request <b>messages</b> to the RAs whose location information is found to be obsolete during the restoration. The analytical model and experimental results also show that the proposed method outperforms other previous approaches as it selectively sends the location <b>confirmation</b> request <b>messages</b> instead of broadcasting to the RAs during VLR restoration process...|$|R

The absence of central authorization facility in dynamic and distributed environment requires collaboration among nodes. When a source searches for a route to a destination, an intermediate node can reply with its cached entry. To strengthen correctness of such routing discovery process, we propose a method in which the intermediate node requests its next hop to send a <b>confirmation</b> <b>message</b> to the source. After receiving both route reply and <b>confirmation</b> <b>message,</b> the source determines the validity of path according to its policy.

30|$|Previous {{studies have}} used various ways of {{providing}} incentives to respondents and compensate {{them for their}} participation (Navratil et al. 1994). With an increasing reliance on ICT-based communication, it has become less feasible to send gifts or vouchers to respondents directly. Different from the conventional face-to-face interview, incentives {{may need to be}} transmitted electronically, such as electronic coupons, prepaid mobile phone cards, and credits for online games and services. This panel study provided prepaid mobile phone cards of around RMB 30 – 50 yuan (≈ 4.8 - 8.0 USD) to compensate respondents, and this amount could be deposited directly to their phone numbers. As with the strategy of sending gift vouchers together with a change-of-address card (Laurie and Scott 1999), this study also used this chance to update contact information by sending <b>confirmation</b> <b>messages</b> to their phone numbers. However, such economic incentives may not be big enough to persuade some to participate, and for others, the exchange relationship may cause discomfort since they do not like the instrumental feeling of “selling information.” In both situations, the research team worked on the emotional aspects of how respondents felt about the survey in various ways.|$|R

30|$|SAT [17] i.e., Secure Aggregation Tree is {{a method}} that detects and {{prevents}} cheating in the network. This method does not use any cryptographic operation; however, detection of cheating {{is based on the}} topological constraints in the aggregation tree. This method is different from other proposed methods as it is based on cheating detection instead of persistent data authentication. With topological constraints in SAT, each node can hear all messages sent to its father node and message sent by a father node to its grandfather node, that help to check whether father node performs the Data Aggregation correctly or not. If the father node sends aggregated value which is different from the correct aggregation value, then the node will raise an alert. On receiving the alert message by neighbouring nodes they all check whether the cheating node is its father node or not. If yes, then weighted confidence is evaluated. If the weighted confidence value is larger than a predefined threshold value, then the father node is assigned to be cheating node and a detection <b>confirmation</b> <b>message</b> is broadcasted within a given hop limit. After that, the node receiving the detection <b>confirmation</b> <b>message</b> will use recovery mechanism to avoid using the compromised node. During Data Aggregation, a metric to represent the degree of belief is generated for defining the uncertainty in the aggregated result. This framework effectively measures the uncertainty in both data and aggregation result.|$|E
