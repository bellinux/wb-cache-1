50|$|ICAO {{codes are}} {{separate}} and different from IATA codes, which are generally used for airline timetables, reservations, and baggage tags. For example, the IATA code for London's Heathrow Airport is LHR and its ICAO code is EGLL. ICAO codes are commonly seen by passengers {{and the general}} public on flight-tracking services such as FlightAware, though passengers will more often see the IATA <b>codes,</b> on their <b>tickets</b> and their luggage tags. In general IATA codes are usually derived from the name of the airport or the city it serves, while ICAO codes are distributed by region and country. Far more aerodromes (in the broad sense) have ICAO codes than IATA codes, and to add to the confusion IATA codes are sometimes assigned to railway stations.|$|R

5000|$|The League {{was founded}} in 1930 as the [...] "League of New York Theatres and Producers".

5000|$|Despite initial {{opposition}} from the Chinese Ministry of Railways, train tickets were upgraded in late 2009 to accommodate QR <b>codes</b> on a <b>ticket,</b> thus enabling personal information to be stored. This would link the ticket with its legal purchaser, {{paving the way for}} a [...] "real name and ID" [...] requirement to be implemented. Such a policy went into effect on a trial basis beginning early 2010 (for the duration of the Chunyun period on all non high-speed trains). In 2011, the [...] "real name and ID" [...] requirement expanded to more cities in China, and was made permanent for the Wuhan-Guangzhou High-Speed Railway even after the Chunyun period. The requirement became mandatory for all CRH high speed trains with effect from June 1, 2011 and was expanded to nearly all passenger trains on January 1, 2012. It is now policy for station staff and rail police to check all riders against their document of identity and to deny boarding to those without a ticket or with no linked ID.|$|R
5|$|The {{tickets were}} first {{available}} {{to members of}} Gaga's social network website, Littlemonsters.com. They were provided with a unique <b>code</b> for ordering <b>tickets</b> from online, but were limited to four tickets per member. According to Live Nation, the first batch of tickets for the tour went on sale from December 9, 2013, and sell-out shows were reported from Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, Los Angeles and Edmonton within hours. This led to two new dates being added to the itinerary: June 26 at Milwaukee's Marcus Amphitheater, and June 28 at Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall. On January 29, 2014, Gaga released the dates for the European leg of the tour, which would begin September 23, 2014, from Belgium. The singer partnered with British mobile network O2, for a deal which would enable the company's customers to avail tickets for the tour three days prior to the general release. The deal included Gaga being featured in a new advertisement, for promoting the UK leg of the tour and showed her wearing a dress with large, glittering shoulder pads while running towards a concert stage. This {{was the second time}} Gaga partnered with O2, first in November 2013, for exclusive access to the tracks from Artpop, ahead of its UK release. Upon release, Ticketmaster reported that the UK venues sold out within five minutes, prompting the singer to add another two dates in London. In April and May 2014, she released more floor tickets for sale, after ensuring larger crowd capacity for all the UK venues and a total of eight new dates.|$|R
