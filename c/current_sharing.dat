40|$|Abstract—For the {{converter}} parallel operation, the <b>current</b> <b>sharing</b> between modules {{is important for}} the reliability of the system. Among several <b>current</b> <b>sharing</b> schemes, the droop method needs no interconnection between modules, which implies true redundancy. But the droop method has poor voltage regulation and poor <b>current</b> <b>sharing</b> characteristics. In this paper, a novel droop method is proposed for {{the converter}} parallel operation, which adaptively controls the reference voltage of each module. This greatly improves the output voltage regula-tion and the <b>current</b> <b>sharing</b> of the conventional droop method. The analysis of the proposed method and design procedure are pro-vided and experimental results verify the excellent performance of the proposed method.

40|$|The {{integration}} {{of renewable energy}} sources in modern electric grids have drawn increasing attention nowadays. In order to effectively manage large-scale renewable energy sources and achieve flexible and efficient operation, the concept of microgrids have been proposed. Considering the nature of DC outputs in many distributed energy resources (DERs), DC microgrids have been extensively studied in the past years. Among the operational issues in DC microgrids, <b>current</b> <b>sharing</b> issues have become an important topic since it is highly relevant to the operation of DC microgrids. By adopting a proper design of <b>current</b> <b>sharing</b> strategy in DC microgrids, the current rating violations in each interface converter can be successfully avoided. In this paper, a looped-chain-based active <b>current</b> <b>sharing</b> strategy is proposed to realize high accuracy <b>current</b> <b>sharing</b> in DC microgrids. In particular, the output current is shared between the neighboring interface converters. Hence, following a clockwise or counter-clockwise order, a looped-chain-based control diagram can be established to share the reference value of the output current. A final status in the whole DC microgrid is that the output current of every interface converter is equalized. Hence, the desired <b>current</b> <b>sharing</b> objective can be satisfied. A MATLAB simulation model is established to verify the proposed looped-chain-based active <b>current</b> <b>sharing</b> strategy in DC microgrids...|$|E
