50|$|Millen, Sundog and Adams, {{joined by}} Hazel with his <b>tracker</b> <b>dogs,</b> set {{off into the}} frozen {{wilderness}} after Johnson. The case has made front page news across the country, and many trappers join in the chase, attracted by the $1,000 bounty that {{has been placed on}} Johnson's life. Captain Hank Tucker (Scott Hylands), a Royal Canadian Air Force pilot, is sent by the government to join the hunt, which is causing a national embarrassment. He reveals that Johnson {{was a member of a}} United States Army special intelligence unit during World War I.|$|R
5|$|Ranson {{suspected}} a suicide, but {{a thorough}} search of Newhaven Downs was judged impossible. A partial search was made, using <b>tracker</b> <b>dogs,</b> {{but all that}} was found were the skeletal remains of a judge who had disappeared years earlier. Police divers searched the harbour, and a partial search using infra-red photography was undertaken the following year, to no avail. A warrant for Lucan's arrest, to answer charges of murdering Sandra Rivett, and attempting to murder his wife, was issued on Tuesday 12November 1974. Descriptions of his appearance, already issued to police forces across the UK, were then issued to Interpol.|$|R
50|$|During a stealth {{practice}} the next day, Walker brings in the <b>tracker</b> <b>dog.</b> They test the dog's sniffing power by having Jones {{pretending to be}} a Nazi parachutist. They remove Jones' jacket and allow the dog to pick up his scent. As they head up the church hall stairs, Mrs Pike arrives to remind Wilson about their téte-a-téte supper. As the platoon, Jones and the dog come charging down the stairs, they knock down Mrs Pike, revealing her underwear. Walker remembers that he sold the last pair of knickers to Mrs Pike, and they're white: it was a British parachute.|$|R

50|$|To {{provide a}} high level of {{protection}} for the wildlife, especially the endangered wildlife, as well as the people on Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, it is essential to have an extremely effective security system. Lewa's security operation includes a well-trained and highly motivated ranger force, both armed and unarmed; a <b>tracker</b> <b>dog</b> team; and reliable communications network with its neighbours, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), local government agencies, community conservancies affiliated to the Northern Rangelands Trust and private wildlife conservation projects and conservancies in the area. Regular aerial surveillance is carried out and the boundary electric game fence is maintained.|$|R
5000|$|Michelle and Henriette {{are waiting}} for the false airmen (Herrs Flick and Von Smallhausen) to land and are joined by Crabtree, {{disguised}} as a resistance girl with a mackintosh and huge false ears. In one of the aeroplanes, the two of them get ready to jump and soon do so, with Herr Flick pushing Herr Von Smallhausen out of the plane. Meanwhile, general Von Klinkerhoffen, colonel Von Strohm and Helga are waiting on the ground and are soon joined by lieutenant Gruber, who has the <b>tracker</b> <b>dogs</b> with him. In another aeroplane, captain Bertorelli and his four men are also preparing themselves to jump. His men are reluctant, since it is a long way down, but he [...] "drops" [...] them by opening a trap door in the floor.|$|R

25|$|However, U.S. pilots claimed 6,600 trucks {{destroyed}} {{along the}} trail during the same period. This mismatch in numbers, combined with a sensor surveillance program begun in late 1967, {{cast doubt on the}} accuracy of the road watch teams. More importantly, the February 1968 advent of AC-130 Spectre gunships with all their onboard electronic surveillance rendered ground observation largely obsolete. A new military intelligence processing center called Task Force Alpha opened at Nakhon Phanom to collate all sources of information from the trail. By Summer 1969, the road watch teams were dwindling away. The ever-increasing countermeasures of enemy foot patrols and use of <b>tracker</b> <b>dogs</b> also had its effect. In any event, the U.S. air effort against PAVN trucks had reached its limit; it became obvious that no matter the true truck count, air strikes were not going to halt the infiltration.|$|R
50|$|It is {{eighteen}} {{months since the}} outbreak of World War II began and Captain Mainwaring is giving a lecture {{on the progress of}} the war, and admits that they have thrown the Allies out of Greece and Crete, but reminds them that Rudolf Hess surrendered not too long ago, so the rats are leaving the sinking ship. However, he tells the platoon that the enemy are dropping empty parachutes to confuse the people, and if they spot one, they must report it to GHQ. Jones wonders what the difference is between British parachutes and Nazi parachutes. Mainwaring's memo tells him that British parachutes are white, while Nazi parachutes are a dirty, creamy, off-white. Frazer points out that the parachutist may be miles away by the time they find the parachute, so Walker decides to bring a <b>tracker</b> <b>dog</b> to the next parade.|$|R
5000|$|Lucky was posthumously {{awarded the}} Dickin Medal by the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals on 6 February 2007 at a {{ceremony}} at the Imperial War Museum in London alongside another dog, Sadie. It {{is considered to be}} the animal's equivalent to the Victoria Cross. The medals were awarded by Princess Alexandra, and Lucky's was received by Corporal Beval Austin Stapleton, who said [...] "Every minute of every day in the jungle we trusted our lives to those four dogs, and they never let us down, Lucky {{was the only one of}} the team to survive our time in the Malayan jungle and I'm so proud of the old dog today. I owe my life to him." [...] It was on behalf of the four RAF <b>tracker</b> <b>dogs</b> posted to the Malaysian campaign between 1949 and 1952.|$|R
50|$|At the German headquarters, general Von Klinkerhoffen is {{very glad}} that the Gestapo's plan has been revealed. He tells Helga, colonel Von Strohm and captain Bertorelli that, {{in order for the}} credit for {{discovering}} the resistance headquarters not to go to the Gestapo, they will adpot their plan and put it into operation first. The colonel points out that their faces are familiar and {{that they will not be}} able to pass themselves off as British airmen. However, captain Bertorelli points out, that the faces of his men are not known and thus, the task of jumping out of a captured British aeroplane while the Germans are firing blanks at them, goes to Bertorelli's men. In order for the Germans not to lose them when the resistance have picked them up, they will be outfitted with aniseed balls, which they will drop every ten meters. Then, the Germans will have <b>tracker</b> <b>dogs</b> that will be able to find them that way.|$|R
50|$|Other units {{listed in}} the Kenya Regiment history as being in Kenya from 1952-56 include the Battle School, Tracker School, Kenya Regiment TF, Kenya Regiment Training Centre, and Heavy Battery.

5000|$|When {{he failed}} to return, {{hundreds}} of sailors and local police scoured the Aiea Mountains looking for him. [...] <b>Trackers</b> with <b>dogs</b> were brought in from Schofield Barracks but no trace of Latimore was ever found. A Naval investigation into his disappearance was launched in 1941. [...] His disappearance was never explained and {{was the subject of}} much local news coverage and rumor before being overshadowed by the Pearl Harbor attack.|$|R
40|$|Significant {{levels of}} {{antibodies}} {{indicative of a}} variety of zoonotic infections were demonstrated in sera collected from 64 U. S. military scout and <b>tracker</b> <b>dogs</b> after service in the Republic of Vietnam (RVN). Scrub typhus antibodies were found in 45 % of the specimens, melioidosis in 19 %, group B arbovirus in 49 %, and leptospirosis in 62 %. Only 38 % of the seropositive reactions for leptospirosis could be related to overseas infections. Tests were conducted on paired sera obtained from 32 of the dogs before service in RVN. Significant increases in titer were demonstrated with scrub typhus, melioidosis, leptospirosis, plague, group B arbovirus, and Rickettsia canada antigens. After 2 to 6 months of service in RVN, 8 of 19 dogs developed antibody titers to at least one of four zoonotic diseases. Only 3 of 45 dogs with 7 or more months of service failed to develop antibodies to {{one or more of the}} agents. The serological findings pose questions on the potential epidemiological importance and veterinary significance of scrub typhus, group B arbovirus, leptospirosis, and melioidosis infections in dogs...|$|R
2500|$|The police search {{operation}} was headed by Detective Superintendent Doug Smith of Cleveland Police and involved door-to-door inquiries, <b>tracker</b> <b>dogs,</b> and local volunteers. Warehouses, industrial buildings, and disused buildings around the adjacent docks were searched while HM Coastguard, a police helicopter, and a Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat searched {{the sea and}} shore. Police first called at Armstrong's flat on 1 July while conducting initial door-to-door inquiries during which residents were asked to answer a questionnaire aimed at tracing her last movements. On 2 July they returned while carrying out [...] "cursory searches" [...] of houses in the area. On 3 July two detectives spoke to Armstrong; they noticed that his previously [...] "co-operative, friendly and helpful" [...] demeanour had changed, and that he then appeared [...] "very shifty, on edge and looking very worried". Acting on suspicion, the detectives arrested Armstrong and a second search of his first-floor flat was conducted. Palmer's mutilated {{body was found in}} a bin liner inside an airing cupboard in the flat. Her shorts and underwear were found nearby in a separate bag. Armstrong denied any involvement in the crime and claimed that [...] "someone else must have put the body there".|$|R
2500|$|Retired Lieutenant Colonel George Hulse, {{president}} of the Australian Defence Force <b>Trackers</b> and War <b>Dogs</b> Association, stated he and many others had [...] "abandoned any hope" [...] of finding Sarbi. On her return, Hulse described Sarbi as [...] "an exceptionally good worker, very gritty dog and has found improvised explosive devices and she's saved quite a few lives in her work." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Doctor {{intends to}} get to the Space Defence Station and contact UNIT. The soldier finds Sarah and {{questions}} her; Morgan suggests that Sarah might be part of [...] "the test" [...] and tells her to go. She observes that behind the visor of the white-suits are nothing but plastic and electronics. While examining one of the pods which she has found near to the TARDIS, the time machine dematerialises without her. Sarah is attacked by a man lying in the pod, but breaks free.At the defence station, Senior Defence Astronaut Guy Crayford is addressed by the voice of Styggron, who orders him to check for an intruder. The Doctor enters Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart's office, but it is empty. Discovered by Crayford, the Doctor introduces himself as UNIT's scientific advisor, but is placed in detention. Sarah arrives and frees the Doctor from his cell, but is unaware that an alien — a Kraal — is observing them. When the Doctor tells Sarah about Crayford, she reveals that he vanished in deep space, presumed dead, during testing of a craft. The Doctor and Sarah are able to escape despite the efforts of Crayford's men, including their friends Sergeant Benton and Harry Sullivan, and are pursued by <b>tracker</b> <b>dogs.</b> When Sarah twists her ankle, the Doctor hides her in a tree. He is able to throw the dogs off his own trail, but when the soldiers turn back they capture Sarah. Styggron tells Crayford to locate, but not seize, the Doctor; he has other plans for him. In an alien-looking room, Sarah is strapped to a table and scanned by Harry. In the village, the Doctor finds that the telephones are not working. Styggron speaks to another Kraal, Chedaki, to discuss their experiments and plans to conquer Earth and other worlds. Styggron contacts Crayford and tells him to commence the final test.|$|R
5000|$|On its {{original}} release, the film made little impact at the box-office and its press was mainly negative. This was partly {{because at the}} time the issue of paedophilia and child sexual abuse was a great taboo, rarely referred to or spoken about, and merely to produce a film dealing openly with the issue was deemed sordid and distasteful. Another hindrance to commercial success was that the film was far from easy to categorise, so it was difficult to market to any specific film audience demographic. In terms of genre it had elements of suspense, horror, courtroom drama and social commentary, but did not fit neatly into any general classification. In addition some of the publicity chosen for the film [...] - [...] such as a promotional poster with an image of armed police with <b>tracker</b> <b>dogs,</b> and the tagline [...] "A nightmare manhunt for maniac prowler!" [...] - [...] was misleading as it implied a fugitive-on-the-run chase thriller. Hammer Studios boss James Carreras later commented: [...] "Message pictures? I tried one [...] - [...] Never Take Sweets from a Stranger. Nobody bought it. I'm not an artist. I'm a businessman." [...] The film did garner some positive reviews, with Variety for example saying: [...] "Gwen Watford and Patrick Allen, as the distraught parents, and Alison Leggatt, as a wise, understanding grandmother, lead a cast which is directed with complete sensitivity by Cyril Frankel. Both Watford and Allen are completely credible while Leggatt, well-served by John Hunter's script, is outstanding. Aylmer, who doesn't utter a word throughout the film, gives a terrifying acute study of crumbling evil." [...] The film quickly disappeared from view, and for many years remained little-known and rarely screened. Indeed no indication can be found that it was ever shown on British television.|$|R
50|$|With the {{imminent}} {{threat of the}} Dominator looming, she goes with Croaker to see the White Rose, to form an alliance against their common foe. Goblin, One-Eye, <b>Tracker</b> and Toadkiller <b>Dog</b> return shortly afterwards. They all gather in front of Old Father Tree, who recognizes them, especially the latter two. Unmasked as the escaped servants of the Dominator, they try to kill the White Rose and the Lady, but Toadkiller Dog is driven off and Tracker converted into Old Father Tree's slave. Scorn and Blister, two of the new Taken, try to assassinate their mistress but fail and pay the ultimate price for their treachery.|$|R
