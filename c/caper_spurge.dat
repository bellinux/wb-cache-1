50|$|Euphorbia lathyris (<b>caper</b> <b>spurge</b> {{or paper}} spurge) is {{a species of}} spurge native to {{southern}} Europe (France, Italy, Greece, northwest Africa, and eastward through southwest Asia to western China.|$|E
50|$|Where mole-hills are not desired, the moles may {{be killed}} or, preferably, {{deterrent}} plants like <b>caper</b> <b>spurge</b> or the related castor bean plant can be planted. The fresh molehills {{can also be}} removed carefully {{as soon as they}} appear. This leaves the animals and their galleries undamaged and thus reduces the need for the moles to make further molehills when they clear earth out of the tunnels.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature park}} has Mediterranean climate. Dominant {{vegetation}} {{in the park}} are the trees red pine (Pinus resinosa) and jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) {{as well as the}} shrubs topped lavender (Lavandula stoechas), marjoram (Origanum) and <b>caper</b> <b>spurge</b> (Euphorbia lathyris). Tne sandy beach of the nature park is an ovulation site for the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta). The Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus), living in the coastal sea of Anamur, may be also observed at site.|$|E
5000|$|Under his direction, {{the colony}} began {{cultivating}} peanuts, potatoes, sweet potatoes, beans, onions, sugar beets, maize, and tobacco. Peyret also introduced superior techniques for growing wheat and he lobbied Urquiza for new {{land on which}} to establish an experimental station for growing cotton. He experimented with <b>caper</b> <b>spurge</b> and the adaptability of silkworms to the local climate. He built a factory for the manufacture of peanut oil. For his work with potato farming, he received an honorable mention [...] at the National Exposition of Córdoba [...] held between October 15 and January 21, 1872. On January 3 he sent the chief commissioner of the Exposition {{a report on the}} state of Colonia San José and Villa de Colón and the prospect of future colonization of Entre Ríos Province.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe macrocyclic lathyrane {{polyester}} Euphorbia factor L 10 (1 a) {{has been}} {{obtained from the}} seeds of the <b>caper</b> <b>spurge</b> (E. lathyris). The interaction of L 10 (1 a) and its acetyl derivative (1 b) with P-glycoprotein, a multidrug transporter overexpressed in cancer cells and responsible for resistance to chemotherapy, was investigated. The results established lathyrane diterpenoids as a novel chemotype for P-glycoprotein inhibitors.

40|$|<b>Caper</b> <b>spurge</b> (Euphorbia lathyris L.) {{seed oil}} {{contains}} {{a series of}} diterpenoids known as Euphorbia factors, or L-factors, L 1 -L 9. They are esters of several polyols (lathyrol, epoxylathyrol, hydroxylathyrol and ingenol) and account for about 3 - 5 % of the oil. The percentage of ingenol-based L-factors is very low, less than 5 % of the diterpenoid fraction, {{but some of them}} (factors L 5 and L 6) are responsible for the irritant and co-carcinogenic activities of the oil. This paper reports an HPLC-UV and HPLC-positive-ESI-MS analysis of the diterpenoid fraction of <b>caper</b> <b>spurge</b> seed oil before and after selective hydrolysis of ingenol-based L-factors. Separation of lathyrane polyols and esters, and ingenol and its esters was achieved using a chromatographic system consisting of a C 18 stationary phase and acetonitrile: water as mobile phase. A new macrocyclic constituent, the deoxy Euphorbia factor L 1, was identified in the oil...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction We {{report the}} case of a patient with extreme pain {{following}} accidental exposure to the latex of Euphorbia lathyris. Case presentation A 76 -year-old Caucasian woman attended the ophthalmology department with acute severe bilateral eye pain. This occurred immediately after having pulled a weed out of her garden with her bare hands. She recalled having subsequently rubbed her eyes. The offending plant, was brought into hospital and was identified as the <b>Caper</b> <b>Spurge</b> (Euphorbia lathyris). Her ocular pH was alkaline (pH 9). After copious irrigation, the pH normalised. She was treated with topical steroids, cycloplegics, lubricants and opioid oral analgesia. Three days later, she was symptom-free and her vision had returned to normal. Conclusion Exposure to <b>Caper</b> <b>spurge</b> latex is a rare cause of keratoconjunctivitis. It can, however, potentially lead to corneal ulceration, anterior uveitis and rarely blindness. Treatment remains largely empirical. Exposure to the milky latex can result in extreme pain requiring prompt treatment. The use of goggles and gloves is recommended when handling this plant. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEuphorbia lathyris (<b>Caper</b> <b>spurge)</b> is a toxic and potent Chinese materia medica (T/PCMM). This study {{sought a}} method for {{identifying}} five diterpenoids (Euphorbia factors L 1 −L 3, L 7 a and L 8) with the spectra of UV and mass, quantifying three diterpenoids L 1, L 2, and L 8 in crude extracts of unprocessed and processed E. lathyris seeds by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC–ESI-MS). The analysis was achieved on an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C 18 column (4. 6 mm× 150 mm i. d., 5 μm) with an isocratic elution with a mobile phase consisting of water and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0. 25 mL/min at column temperature of 30 °C and UV detection was set at 272 nm. An ESI source was used with a positive ionization mode. The calibration curve was linear in the ranges of 9. 9 – 79 μg/mL for Euphorbia factor L 1, 3. 8 – 30. 5 μg/mL for Euphorbia factor L 2, and 1. 0 – 20. 6 μg/mL for Euphorbia factor L 8. The average recoveries (n= 6) of three diterpenoids were 98. 39 %, 91. 10 % and 96. 94 %, respectively, with RSD of 2. 5 %, 2. 4 % and 2. 1 %, respectively. The contents of the three diterpenoids in processed E. lathyris seeds were 3. 435, 1. 367 and 0. 286 mg/g, respectively, which decreased more sharply than those in unprocessed E. lathyris seeds which were 4. 915, 1. 944 and 0. 425 mg/g, respectively. The method is simple, accurate, reliable and reproducible, {{and it can be}} applied to control the quality of unprocessed and processed E. lathyris seeds...|$|E
