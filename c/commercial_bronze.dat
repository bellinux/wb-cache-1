Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance.

5000|$|In the US, zinc is used {{predominantly}} for galvanizing (55%) and for brass, {{bronze and}} other alloys (37%). [...] The relative reactivity of zinc {{and its ability}} to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water from corrosion.Zinc is also used as an anode material for batteries such as in zinc-carbon batteries or zinc-air battery/fuel cells.A widely used alloy which contains zinc is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, depending upon the type of brass.

40|$|Copper {{and copper}} alloys {{are widely used}} in {{architectural}} applications {{to take advantage of}} their inherent range of colors. While these metals may be used in their natural color, as fabricated, it is sometimes desirable to chemically color pure copper (C 11000 *), <b>commercial</b> <b>bronze</b> (C 22000), architectural bronze (C 38500) or other alloys referred to as “bronze ” in architectural parlance. The most common colors to be produced are referred to as brown or statuary finishes for bronze and green or patina finishes for copper. This data sheet outlines procedures and formulations for producing both. While the chemical solutions described are those generally accepted in the metal finishing trade, many variations exist. The wide range of colors and shades which may be achieved are largely a matter of craftsmanship and experience. Chemical coloring techniques depend upon time, temperature, surface, preparation, mineral content of the water, humidity and other variables which influence the ultimate result.

40|$|The {{effect of}} iron {{addition}} to Cu-Al-Ni alloys (in {{the zone of}} the chemical composition of <b>commercial</b> aluminium <b>bronze)</b> has been studied. The quaternary alloys were melted from a base Cu-Al-Ni alloy with iron additions up to ~ 6 at. %. Simultaneous Differential Thermal Analysis and Termogravimetry (DSC/TGA) and isothermal homogenisation with rapid cooling have been employed to determine the equilibrium phases at different temperatures and the existing invariant reactions. The alloys were observed by Optical Microscopy (OP) and by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The chemical analysis of the phases has been determined by Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The results obtained allow {{the determination of the}} effect of the iron content in the sequence of phase formation. The chemical compositions of the phases obtained are compared with the same phases in the commercial alloys, with other alloying elements being present.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this work}} a {{formulation}} {{of a new}} organic compound, namely 3 -phenyl- 1. 2. 4 -triazole- 5 -thione, was tested as a bronze corrosion inhibitor. This formulation (FPTS) {{has proven to be}} environmentally friendly, cheap and easy to use. The inhibitory effect of this formulation has been studied on <b>commercial</b> <b>bronze</b> (B 66) with chemical composition,metallurgical features and micro-chemical structure {{similar to that of the}} ancient alloys installed in museumof Rabat (capital ofMorocco) near the atlantic ocean, in order to be successfully employed and used for testing corrosion inhibitor validating cleaning and conservation techniques. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potentiodynamic polarization, Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with chemical analysis (SEM and EDAX) and X-ray photoelectron Spectroscopy were used to study the inhibition action of FPTS in 3 % NaCl. The obtained results show that the FPTS formulation has a significant effect against corrosion of B 66 bronze in 3 % NaCl solution, reaching an efficiency of 99 % at 5. 10 - 3 M. This result encouraged us to test this formulation on real archaeological objects. The evaluation of the protective effect of FPTS on archaeological bronzes shows that it provides good protection of the Bronze artefacts against atmospheric corrosion for a long duration of exposure.  2013 Trade Science Inc. - INDI...|$|E

5000|$|By 1160 bronze coins {{had become}} a rarity, and became largely an {{abstract}} measurement of value rather than a tangible currency, the most important attribute of bronze coins after this year was as a measurement {{for the value of}} other currencies, by 1161 a shortage in wén coins had forced the Southern Song government to halve the salary of their soldiers and rather than pay them 50% in Huizi, 30% in silver, and only 20% in bronze coins. After 1170 the Song court established Huizi paper money on a permanent basis based on the [...] "Pinda" [...] (...) formula that mandated that taxes were only half paid in coin and the other half in Huizi notes. This formula would prove successful as it increased the value of Huizi in circulation, while also increasing the demand for the uncommon wén coins. Huizi notes were increasingly used for <b>commercial</b> purposes while <b>bronze</b> coins were often being hoarded up as savings, although the Huizi notes were also hoarded up as savings, the government had set up a 3 year expiry term so people would have to constantly renew their banknotes at government offices to stop them from hoarding the value up like what happened with bronze coinage.|$|R
40|$|Wire and Arc based Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) {{processes}} are novel {{technologies that are}} seen as promising candidates for fabricating complex 3 -Dimensional large scale components. These processes offer avenues to locally tailor metallurgy of the melt pool and thus produce functionally and compositionally graded components for improved performance in extreme conditions. This thesis explores in-situ alloying of <b>commercial</b> Manganese Aluminium <b>Bronze</b> (MAB) with copper rich Cu 3 Si filler wire during deposition, as a microstructure control strategy for designing components that are resistant against selective phase corrosion. Evolution of microstructure during WAAM processing of MAB and during in-situ alloying with Cu 3 Si wire is investigated using optical and electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and fluorescence. The microstructure of the as-deposited MAB bead is observed to change from continuous connected dual phase to cellular single phase upon controlled addition of Cu 3 Si in a MAB melt pool. Corrosion tests showed reduced severity of surface attack and an improvement {{in the rate of}} corrosion by 3 times for the new alloy. Thus this technique can be used in industries to improve corrosion resistance as an energy efficient alternative of conventional high temperature aging treatments. Additionally, the possibilities of improving mechanical behaviour of the new alloy (cellular single phase) are explored using the principles of grain refinement in the context of WAAM...|$|R
40|$|Examining the {{background}} of the exceptional genetic improvement attained in turkeys during the last three decades the main aim of the present research was to assess the contribution of genetic merit (genetic factor) and that of the feeding management (environmental factor) to the realised improvement. BUT Big 6 turkeys and their currently used <b>commercial</b> diet, traditional <b>Bronze</b> type turkeys and their reconstructed diet used in the 1960 s were set to a three factorial (G = genotype, I = sex, T = type of diet) trial, carried out in climatized and windowless houses and lasted till 20 weeks of age. Based on the results it could be concluded that the influence of feeding on the turkeys performance was variable with the changing age nevertheless it was substantially less (7 - 13 %) than that of the genotype. The performance of the modern hybrid using the current diet was 3. 1 - 3. 2 times more compared it to that of the Bronze type turkeys however, applying the diet used in the 1960 s the advantage over the to the Bronze type turkeys performance was decreased to 3. 0 - 3. 1 times. Test slaughters in turkey showed radical anatomical changes. The 13 - 18 % improvement in dressing percentage resulted in a highly favourable 10 % breast fillets (due to the ratio changes of different body regions) increase on the other hand the 55 - 65 % relative heart ratio is critical from the aspect of an unstable circulatory system...|$|R
