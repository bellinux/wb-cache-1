50|$|The Range Rover Long-Wheelbase Autobiography Black is {{a limited}} version of the 2014 Range Rover Long-Wheelbase for the US market, with the first 25 units in Valloire White {{pearlescent}} body colour. Changes include front grille and side vents and badging in black enamel and chrome, signature rear lamps, a chrome accent finish to the tailgate and auxiliary vents to the front, new exclusive 7-spoke 21-inch wheels with a high gloss polished finish, individualized front and rear seating package (bespoke seat cover design, front and rear leather seats with seat memory and climate control and massage function, adjustable 18-way front seat including upper seat articulation, two individual fully adjustable rear seats with lumbar massage and powered recline, new rear center console (electrically deployable tables covered in black leather with integrated USB charging sockets and cup holders, a <b>chiller</b> <b>compartment,</b> a ski hatch), 10.2-inch rear seat entertainment screens with navigation displays, a powered recliner calf rest at rear right seat), 10-colour configurable LED mood lighting (door handles and stowage compartments, {{along the lines of}} the veneered surfaces on the center console), leather-wrapped rear cargo trim, A-, B- and C-pillar trim, a perforated leather finish on the door insert, leather-wrapped seat backs, ski hatch, cargo trim and upper D-pillar; tread plates with an illuminated 'Autobiography Black' script, a brushed stainless steel tailgate trim, a choice of 3 interior colour schemes (Ebony/Lunar, Espresso/Tan, Dark Cherry/Ivory (with a unique dual-tone seat)).|$|E
40|$|Climatic {{conditions}} {{in countries like}} India vary throughout the year. The summer will be {{three to four months}} with varying temperatures, depending on the location. The refrigerator manufacturers have a design irrespective of the region to cater for all regions. A sample survey shows that the <b>chiller</b> <b>compartment</b> is mainly used only for making ice, and sparingly used. Frosting occurs in the chiller because of low temperature design. The bottom plate of the chiller is found to be major place for accumulation of frost. In the present work an experimental investigation is taken up to find the effect on frosting characteristics for a domestic refrigerator chiller by removing the bottom plate of the chiller and compare them with that of the four sided <b>chiller</b> <b>compartment.</b> The results support the idea that removal of bottom plate nevertheless rises temperature in the <b>chiller</b> <b>compartment</b> but definitely effects power savings by reducing frost formation...|$|E
40|$|Open {{refrigerated}} display cabinets {{are becoming}} more widespread since they are believed to enhance sales by providing {{easy access to the}} chilled products. Air curtains are used as a barrier between the warm ambient air and the <b>chilled</b> <b>compartment</b> of the fridge. The effectiveness of the air curtain depends on many parameters. The objective of this work is to study the effect of jet velocity, turbulence intensity and temperature on the performance of a commercial refrigerated display cabinet aiming at minimizing energy usage. A 2 -D numerical model suing double precision was solved using the computational software “Fluent ” that include the full buoyancy effect and radiation between surfaces. Results include temperature variations, estimation of the entrainment of air into the fridge and heat exchanged with the ambient air in the room. The numerical results indicate that jets with lower velocities at colder temperature enhance the efficiency of the open fridge. A reduction of 19. 5 % in the air entrainment and 23 % in the heat gain was observed in comparison with the current setting. Temperature measurements and flow visualization using smoke were conducted to validate the numerical simulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to monitor the operational conditions of the transport of chilled and frozen foods during delivery within cities and to evaluate {{the impact of the}} door openings on the alteration of the internal temperature of the refrigerated environment. Several temperature and pressure sensors were used in a refrigerated container with two compartments and they were installed in the refrigeration system unit and on the internal and external surfaces of the container. After the monitoring tests, it was verified that door openings during deliveries resulted in a disturbance that raised the internal temperature of the refrigerated container above values recommended for adequate conservation of the products transported. Moreover, increasing the number of door openings promoted a cumulative effect on the internal temperature, mainly in the <b>chilled</b> food <b>compartment</b> of the container. It was concluded that the refrigeration system unit presented serious limitations with regard to the maintenance of the container's internal temperature during the actual distribution routine, since it does not possess enough instantaneous capacity to restore the temperature set-point between deliveries...|$|R
