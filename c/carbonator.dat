50|$|In addition, {{the cost}} of CO2 {{emissions}} avoided through Ca-looping is lower than {{the cost of}} emissions avoided via an oxyfuel combustion process (~$23.8USD/t). This {{can be explained by the}} fact that, despite the capital costs incurred in constructing the <b>carbonator</b> for Ca-looping, CO2 will not only be captured from the oxy-fired combustion, but also from the main combustor (before the <b>carbonator).</b> The oxygen required in the calciners is only 1/3 that required for an oxyfuel process, lowering air separation unit capital costs and operating costs.|$|E
50|$|CaL {{is usually}} {{designed}} using a dual fluidised bed system to ensure sufficient {{contact between the}} gas streams and the sorbent. The calciner and <b>carbonator</b> are fluidised beds with associated process equipment for separating the gases and solids attached (such as cyclones). Calcination is an endothermic process and as such requires the application of heat to the calciner. The opposite reaction, carbonation, is exothermic and heat must be removed. Since the exothermic reaction happens at about 650 °C and the endothermic reaction at 850-950 °C, {{the heat from the}} <b>carbonator</b> cannot be directly used to heat the calciner.|$|E

5000|$|Flue gas {{containing}} CO2 is fed to {{the first}} vessel (the <b>carbonator),</b> where carbonation occurs. CaCO3 formed is passed to another vessel (the calciner). Calcination occurs at this stage, and the regenerated CaO is quickly passed back to the <b>carbonator,</b> leaving a pure CO2 [...] stream behind. As this cycle continues, CaO sorbent is constantly replaced by fresh (reactive) sorbent. The highly concentrated CO2 from the calciner is suitable for sequestration, and the spent CaO has potential uses elsewhere, most notably in the cement industry. The heat necessary for calcination can be provided by oxy-combustion of coal below.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the heat}} from the <b>carbonator</b> is not at a high enough {{temperature}} {{to be used in the}} calciner, the high temperatures involved (>600 °C) mean that a relatively efficient Rankine cycle for generating electricity can be operated.|$|E
50|$|The {{fluidisation}} of {{the solid}} bed in the <b>carbonator</b> is achieved by passing the flue gas through the bed. In the calciner, some of the recovered CO2 is recycled through the system.

50|$|Also, {{the calcium}} looping process is energy efficient. The heat {{required}} for the endothermic calcination of CaCO3 and the heat required to raise the temperature of fresh limestone from ambient temperature, can be provided by in-situ oxy-fired combustion of fuel in the calciner. Although additional energy is required to separate O2 from N2, {{the majority of the}} energy input can be recovered because the <b>carbonator</b> reaction is exothermic and CO2 from the calciner can be used to power a steam cycle. A solid purge heat exchanger can also be utilized to recover energy from the deactivated CaO and coal ashes from the calciner. As a result, a relatively small efficiency penalty is imposed on the power process, where the efficiency penalty refers to the power losses for CO2 compression, air separation and steam generation. It is estimated at 6-8 % points, compared to 9.5-12.5 % from post combustion amine capture.|$|E

Experimental validation of this concept is provided through a comparative analysis of the results obtained in two laboratory-scale dual fluidized bed (DFB) installations located at INCAR-CSIC (Spain) and IFK (Germany). The analysis {{is focused on the}} performance of the CFB <b>carbonator</b> reactors operated with continuous solid circulation of CaO. A reasonable closure of the carbon balances (i) between the CO 2 that has disappeared from the gas phase, (ii) the CaCO 3 circulating between the reactors and (iii) the CaCO 3 that is formed within the <b>carbonator</b> bed has been established. A necessary condition for the capture of a given molar flow of CO 2 is experimentally demonstrated and requires that a slightly over-stoichiometric molar flow of active CaO is supplied to the <b>carbonator.</b> The deactivation behavior of the sorbents during continuous looping conditions has been measured. The key parameter to interpret the <b>carbonator</b> reactor results has been the active space time, that is indicative of the CaO inventory per molar flow of CO 2 participating in the carbonation reaction and of the reaction rate of the solid inventory in the reactor. Two different approaches have been utilized in order to find a suitable expression for this parameter, thus achieving its correlation with the CO 2 capture efficiency.

Moreover, the tar cracking ability of CaO is demonstrated using thermogravimetric analyzer coupled to Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (TGA-FTIR) experiments. As part of the thermodynamic analysis, sensitivity analyses of the key process parameters, such as the calcium/biomass (Ca/B) ratio, steam/biomass (S/B) ratio, <b>carbonator</b> temperature, and calciner temperature, and their effects on net thermal-to-electricity efficiency have been studied in detail.

40|$|AbstractPostcombustion CO 2 capture by Calcium Looping (CaL) {{has been}} {{successfully}} carried out for more than 700 hours in a 1. 7 MWth continuous pilot facility in La Pereda (Spain). The pilot is equipped with two interconnected circulating fluidized bed reactors: a CO 2 <b>carbonator,</b> where CaCO 3 is formed when CO 2 is captured from a combustion flue gas in contact with fine particles of CaO, and an oxy-fired calciner, where a highly concentrated stream of CO 2 is generated by decomposing the CaCO 3 formed in the <b>carbonator.</b> CaL is a technology {{that has the potential}} to achieve a substantial reduction in the cost of CO 2 capture because of the capability to recover waste heat and generate more power from the additional fuel fired in the calciner. However, one of the weaknesses of CaL systems is the rapid deactivation of the sorbent. The EU “ReCaL” project ([URL] aims to develop a robust and simple reactivation process to stabilize sorbent activity in CaL systems, based on the thermodynamic and kinetic ability of the sorbent to increase its CaCO 3 conversion under enhanced carbonation conditions. This paper presents a first attempt to demonstrate the concept at the scale of the La Pereda 1. 7 MWth pilot plant.

40|$|In calcium looping (CL), {{calcium oxide}} (CaO) {{is used as}} a sorbent for carbon dioxide (CO 2). The CO 2 reacts with CaO to produce calcium {{carbonate}} (CaCO 3) in a <b>carbonator</b> operating at about 650 °C. The CaCO 3 is then sent to another reactor, a calciner operating at about 900 °C, where the CaCO 3 is calcined, producing CaO (which is returned to the <b>carbonator</b> for another cycle) and more or less pure CO 2, which is removed from the system. The calcination is an endothermic process, so a significant flow of thermal energy must be supplied to the calciner for the reaction to occur. In conventional CL the heat is transferred directly by oxy-combustion in the calciner; pure oxygen is required as the oxidizer to avoid mixing CO 2 with nitrogen. Even though most of the thermal energy supplied in the calciner can be recuperated in the <b>carbonator,</b> the oxy-combustion gives an unwanted energy penalty of the CL technology. However, if the heat could be transferred indirectly to the calciner, then then energy penalty associated with oxy-combustion could be avoided, and this would make CL a much more attractive alternative for the thermal power industry. The low energy penalty of CL with indirect calciner heat transfer is due to high-temperature integration between the CO 2 capture plant and the power plant. In this work, Aspen Plus is used to simulate the CL process with indirect heat transfer.

The technology is applied in Dual Fluidized Bed (DFB) systems and offers CO 2 capture rates of 90 % and above with low electric efficiency penalty. Early process feasibility studies for Calcium Looping {{were performed to}} identify the process potential by means of simplified process simulations based on assumptions and experimental data from lab scale. Now, existing experimental data from pilot scale investigations provide a substantial data base for reliable calculation of process efficiency and efficiency penalty for CO 2 capture. Therefore the results of parametric investigations at pilot scale were incorporated into the simulations and new findings like the process improvement potential by natural flue gas water vapor considered. Moreover, the process simulation model was extended with a flue gas recycle for a more realistic process design and a CO 2 capture model to predict CO 2 capture efficiencies based on the operated process parameters. These novelties were used to identify optimum process operating points and further process optimization potential and process efficiency penalty calculated, considering expenditures for oxygen production by an air separation unit and CO 2 compression for storage. The process simulation model is capable {{to be used as}} a design tool for process scale-up. Besides efficiency improvement, load flexibility is a major challenge for CCS plants of the future. In the second part of this publication, concepts to increase load flexibility of Calcium Looping CO 2 capture systems are presented.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} a CO 2 capture {{system based}} on calcium looping, designed for power plants that operate with very low capacity factors and large load fluctuations, including shut-down and start-up periods. This {{can be achieved by}} decoupling the operation of the <b>carbonator</b> and calciner reactors and connecting them to piles filled with CaO or CaCO 3. When the power plant enters into operation, calcined solids are fed into the <b>carbonator</b> to provide the necessary flow of CaO for capturing CO 2 and storing the carbonated solids. An oxy-CFB calciner designed to have a modest thermal capacity and operate continuously refills the CaO pile. Mass and energy balances of the entire system, combined with state-of-the-art performance criteria for reactor design, have been solved to identify suitable operating windows. An analysis of the effect of the CaO reactivity of the material stored in the piles indicates that temperatures of around 500 – 600 °C in the <b>carbonator</b> are compatible with the storage of solids at low temperature (< 250 °C). This, together with the low inherent cost of the material, allows large piles of stored material. Electricity costs between 0. 13 – 0. 15 per kWhe are possible for the system proposed in contrast to standard CaL systems where the cost would increase to above 0. 19 per kWhe when forced to operate at low capacity. The proposed concept could be integrated into existing power plants operating as back-ups in renewable energy systems in preference to other CO 2 capture technologies that are heavily penalized when forced to operate under low capacity factors.
