25|$|The SDA {{attempts}} {{to have a}} relatively positive relationship with retail employers, {{with the idea that}} it allows it to negotiate better outcomes for its members than a more confrontational approach because of the reluctance of SDA members to take industrial action, which rarely if ever occurs in the SDA.

Positive wage growth was recorded between 1993 / 94 and 2004 / 05 for all sixteen employment groups analyzed. (The sixteen groups are rural male/rural female/urban male/urban female cross-classified by regular/casual and agriculture/non-agriculture.) Between 1993 / 94 and 2004 / 05, real wages grew at {{only about half the}} rate of growth of the economy as a whole; but between 2004 / 05 and 2009 / 10, real wages grew at about the same rate as the economy as a whole. Moreover, these wage increases were at about the same rate in regular wage <b>employment,</b> <b>casual</b> wage <b>employment,</b> and the informal sector; the only important group whose wages rose at a slower rate is formal sector workers.|$|R

25|$|The {{urbanisation}} of the Isle of Dogs {{took place}} in the 19th century following the construction of the West India Docks, which opened in 1802. This heralded the area's most successful period, when it became an important centre for trade. The East India Docks were subsequently opened in 1806, followed by Millwall Dock in 1868. By the 1880s, the <b>casual</b> <b>employment</b> system caused Dock workers to unionise under Ben Tillett and John Burns. This led to a demand for 6d per hour (2.5p), and an end to casual labour in the docks. After a bitter struggle, the London Dock Strike of 1889 was settled with victory for the strikers, and established a national movement for the unionisation of casual workers.|$|E
25|$|The Industrial Training Act 1964 {{set up an}} Industrial Training Board to {{encourage}} training for people in work, and within 7 years there were “27 ITBs covering employers with some 15 million workers.” From 1964 to 1968, the number of training places had doubled. The Docks and Harbours Act (1966) and the Dock Labour Scheme (1967) reorganised the system of employment in the docks {{in order to put}} an end to <b>casual</b> <b>employment.</b> The changes made to the Dock Labour Scheme in 1967 ensured a complete end to casual labour on the docks, effectively giving workers the security of jobs for life. Trade unions also benefited from the passage of the Trade Dispute Act 1965. This restored the legal immunity of trade union officials, thus ensuring that they could no longer be sued for threatening to strike.|$|E

40|$|Like most {{management}} ideologies, New Public Management, is paradoxical in practice.

The line management of casual academics is informally delegated to subject coordinators.

60|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the present censorship should be supplemented by a board of experts, who should deal, not with the whole mass of plays sent up for license, but only those which the Examiner of Plays refuses to pass. As the number of plays which the Examiner refuses to pass is never great enough to occupy a Board in permanent session with regular salaries, and as <b>casual</b> <b>employment</b> is not compatible with public responsibility, this proposal would work out in practice as an addition to the duties of some existing functionary. A Secretary of State would be objectionable as likely to be biased politically. An ecclesiastical referee might be biassed against the theatre altogether. A judge in chambers would be the proper authority. This plan would combine the inevitable intolerance of an enlightened censorship with the popular laxity of the Lord Chamberlain.|$|E

Newbery was a worthy, intelligent, kind-hearted man, and a seasonable though cautious friend to authors, relieving them with small loans when in pecuniary difficulties, though always taking care to be well repaid by the labor of their pens. Goldsmith introduces him in a humorous yet friendly manner in his novel of the Vicar of Wakefield. [...] "This person was no other than the philanthropic bookseller in St. Paul's Churchyard, who has written so many little books for children; he called himself their friend; but he was the friend of all mankind. He was no sooner alighted but he was in haste to be gone; for he was ever on business of importance, and was at that time actually compiling materials for the history of one Mr. Thomas Trip. I immediately recollected this good-natured man's red-pimpled face." ...|$|E

There is also some evidence of a widening wage gap between regular workers with graduate and primary education that could possibly be a consequence of trade liberalization and other reforms pursued during the 1990 s.

6000|$|So far as {{the second}} defect, [...] "lack of information," [...] is concerned, a system of Labour Exchanges {{promises}} {{to be of the}} highest value. In proportion as they are used, they will give absolutely contemporary information upon the tendencies of the demand for labour, both in quality and in quantity, as between one trade and another, as between one season and another, as between one cycle and another, and as between one part of the country and another. They will tell the worker where to go for employment. They will tell him, what is scarcely less important, where it is useless to go in search of employment. Properly co-ordinated and connected with the employment bureaux of the various education authorities, which are now coming into existence in Scotland and in England, they will afford an increasing means of guiding the new generation into suitable, promising, and permanent employment, and will divert them from overstocked or declining industries. They will put an end to that portion of unemployment that is merely local or accidental in character. They are the only means of grappling with the evils of <b>casual</b> <b>employment,</b> with all its demoralising consequences. They are capable of aiding the process of dovetailing one seasonal trade into another. A system of Labour Exchanges, dispensing with the need for wandering in search of work, will make it possible, for the first time, to deal stringently with vagrancy. And, lastly, Labour Exchanges are indispensable to any system of Unemployment Insurance, as indeed to any other type of honourable assistance to the unemployed, since they alone can provide an adequate test of the desire for work and of the reality of unemployment. The authority of both Reports of the Poor Law Commission may be cited upon these points; and I shall present this Bill to the House as an important piece of social and industrial machinery, the need for which has long been apparent, and the want of which has been widely and painfully felt.|$|E
60|$|At the garden-door of {{the house}} there appears {{presently}} {{a man who is}} clearly no barbarian, being in fact a less agreeable product peculiar to modern commercial civilization. His frame and flesh are those of an ill-nourished lad of seventeen; but his age is inscrutable: only the absence of any sign of grey in his mud colored hair suggests that he is at all events probably under forty, without prejudice to the possibility of his being under twenty. A Londoner would recognize him at once as an extreme but hardy specimen of the abortion produced by nature in a city slum. His utterance, affectedly pumped and hearty, and naturally vulgar and nasal, is ready and fluent: nature, a Board School education, and some kerbstone practice having made him a bit of an orator. His dialect, apart from its base nasal delivery, is not unlike that of smart London society in its tendency to replace diphthongs by vowels (sometimes rather prettily) and to shuffle all the traditional vowel pronunciations. He pronounces ow as ah, and i as aw, using the ordinary ow for o, i for a, a for u, and e for a, with this reservation, that when any vowel is followed by an r he signifies its presence, not by pronouncing the r, which he never does under these circumstances, but by prolonging and modifyinq the vowel, sometimes even to the extreme degree of pronouncing it properly. As to his yol for l (a compendious delivery of the provincial eh-al), and other metropolitan refinements, amazing to all but cockneys, they cannot be indicated, save in the above imperfect manner, without the aid of a phonetic alphabet. He is dressed in somebody else's very second best as a coast-guardsman, and gives himself the airs of a stage tar with sufficient success to pass as a possible fish porter of bad character in <b>casual</b> <b>employment</b> during busy times at Billingsgate. His manner shows an earnest disposition to ingratiate himself with the missionary, probably for some dishonest purpose.|$|E

A wage subsidy of 50 % of wage costs could thus establish up to 500 000 new jobs for previously unemployed or non-working low skilled workers.

30|$|The reason I suggest {{looking for}} lessons from {{countries}} at similar levels of development, wherever {{in the world}} they might be, is {{that the level of}} development is a central determinant of which policy issues are important in which places. Research on India should be focused on the 85 % of workers who are self-employed or casual wage employees: how {{to get them out of}} self-employment and <b>casual</b> wage <b>employment</b> and how to raise their earnings within their present job statuses if they have no choice but to remain there. But most of the labor market research I have seen on India concerns the other 15 % of workers, those who are regular wage employees. In China, on the other hand, the balance should be different; because the country is now half-urban, half-rural, so the attention of the Chinese government, development organizations, and the research community should be divided roughly equally between urban issues and rural ones.|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{of labor}} force survey (LFS) data {{since the early}} 1990 s reveals several {{important}} changes {{in the structure of}} the Philippine labor force. One is the movement from self-employment to wage employment across a wide range of production sectors. To evaluate this change in terms of workers’ earnings, we combine information on household incomes from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey with information on household members’ employment-related activities from the LFS. We also examine broad structural trends for employment, wages, and earnings. The findings indicate high variance in the earnings of the self-employed and their earnings and educational profiles resemble those of casual wage employees. Both are surpassed by those of permanent wage employees even when observable worker characteristics are controlled for. As self-employment gives way to wage <b>employment,</b> especially <b>casual</b> wage <b>employment</b> in the services sector, the key policy challenge is tackling the slow growth of wages and earnings.

40|$|In Britain, {{the world}} of paid {{employment}} has undergone considerable change over the last twenty years. After the de-industrialisation of the 1980 s, it was increasingly argued not only that economic growth (and thus high levels of employment) was unsustainable, but also {{that the nature of}} paid work had changed irrevocably (Handy, 1984). Jobs were increasingly characterised by apparent insecurities, deriving from managerial practices such as organisational ‘delayering’ (for example, removing supervisory and managerial positions) and ‘outsourcing’ (subcontracting catering, cleaning and other tasks once carried out ‘in-house’). It was suggested that self-employment would rise {{to meet the needs of}} outsourcing, as would non-permanent forms of employment such as fixed term contracts.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{evolution}} {{and structure of}} wage inequality among adult male workers engaged in regular and <b>casual</b> wage <b>employment</b> in India {{during a period of}} radical economic change. The analysis exploits data from nationally representative employment surveys and uses decomposition techniques to examine the role played by educational achievement and industry affiliation. This paper finds that there are striking differences for the two groups of workers. Wage inequality rose between 1983 and 1999 among regular workers but fell among casual workers. While human capital (as embodied in age and education) {{is one of the major}} factors explaining both the level of and change in regular wage inequality, geographic location is the key determinant of casual wage inequality. Industry affiliation plays an equally important role for both sets of workers. These are also consistently the most important contributors to changes in inequality though the directional effects differ among the different sets of workers. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. Between May 1978 and December 1983 the sociologist Ray Pahl conducted seven extensive interviews with a couple from Sheppey that he called 'Linda' and 'Jim'. The interviews evolved into an intensive, profoundly human story of how a family used to 'getting by' (though never 'affluent') coped with the hardships and indignities of long-term reliance on welfare benefits. Perhaps inevitably, fascinating aspects of Linda and Jim's testimony were left unused in Divisions of Labour, primarily because they were marginal to Pahl's principal areas of interest. These edited extracts from the interview transcripts focus on questions of identity and the emotional experience of unemployment. Changing the lens through which we study Linda and Jim does not invalidate Pahl's earlier arguments, but it can offer different insights into {{what it meant to}} be unemployed in Thatcher's Britain.
