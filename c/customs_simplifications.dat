40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} the OECD indicators for assessing the economic and trade impact of specific trade facilitation measures in OECD countries. Twelve trade facilitation indicators (TFIs) have been constructed, corresponding to the main policy areas under negotiation at the WTO, with the aim to estimate the impact of addressing specific facilitation hurdles in the trade procedures of a given country. For OECD countries, the policy areas that seem to have the greatest impact on trade volumes and trade costs are advance rulings, information availability, formalities and procedures and inter-agency cooperation. If all TFIs are added their cost reduction potential would reach almost 10 % of trade costs, which is an estimate consistent with existing literature. The use of individual trade facilitation indicators should enable countries to better assess which trade facilitation dimensions deserve priority. The OECD TFI project is now expanded to cover countries outside the OECD area. transparency, trade facilitation, WTO, trade flows, trade costs, <b>simplification,</b> <b>customs...</b>|$|R

Rete Autostrade Mediterranee (RAM), lead partner of the project, has implemented apilot action focused on the analysis of technical and legislative characteristics of the Directive 2010 / 65 /EU on “Reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from ports of the Member States”, its status of implementation in Italy, possible scenarios for integrating and upscaling existing Port Management Information System (PMIS) and National Single Window (NSW) prototyping in Italy, Cost-Benefit analysis (CBA) for re-engineering existing Port Community Systems (PCSs) in the port of Venice and Levante (Bari) to fulfil reporting formalities according with the EU Directive. In the analysis {{carried out in the}} two ports (the selected case studies), the CBA evidenced the huge amount of potential benefits for the logistic chain triggered by the decrease of dwell time for containers in ports, through reengineering of the existing PCSs within the envisage NSW framework. Dwell time is then crucial for the definition of scenarios of port competitiveness and benchmarking, since it may be largely reduced by the implementation of pre-clearing procedures. Pre-clearing (“anticipated electronic customs clearance”) is able to speeding up of formalities and the consequent relieving of port traffic congestion. The <b>simplification</b> of <b>customs</b> procedures may result in significant benefits for the door-to-door transport time and costs. This aspect has clearly emerged together with lack of top-down information by the two Port Authorities on dwell time. CBA indicators are very positive for both ports and demonstrate how the re-engineering of PCSs in Venice and Bari is expected to lead to abig amount of net benefits. Dwell time is astrategic Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for ports (both for public and private stakeholders), often very difficult to calculate due to confidentiality issues as well as being pre-clearing procedure just testing in some ports in Italy. Nevertheless, acustomized survey at the two ports among local stakeholders (e. g. customs forwarders, freight forwarders, etc.) is deemed necessary and recommended. Despite of the information and data gathering activities implemented at the two Port Authorities, the aforementioned integrative survey should enable to boost CBA results. Key recommendations for ensuring the Italy's NSW compliance with the Directive 2010 / 65 /EU: a) Setting enabling legal framework for the NSW development; b) Setting functional and technical specifications and testing for the NSW development; c) Identification of core business processes for the NSW development; d) National consultation and working groups activities with public and private stakeholders; e) Reengineering and upscaling of PCSs for their interoperability with the NSW; f) Setting high-level (medium-long timeframe) master plan for the NSW full deployment...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that it is once again a shift within the world trade market, {{companies}} tend to have production closer to their end market. For a Swedish company this means to have less production in Asia to the favour for Europe. The forwarders transporting goods from Europe to Sweden will have a higher impact on companies turn over than before and the importance of a good partner in the forwarder is of vital interest. The company SportAlot faces many problems with their present forwarder performing the transports from Europe to Sweden. This thesis is research in a deeper understanding of how SportAlots background problems, bad communication, price reduction possibilities, lack of quality, lack of trust and bad data, will affect a coming negotiation. The research question is: How can a retail company prepare for transport negotiation? The sub-question, Which are the drivers for change in transportation at a retail company?, will partly help to answer the main question. The writer of this thesis uses the hermeneutic view when performing the empirical oriented research with an inductive approach. The research is descriptive in the presentation of the literature review and empirical part, as well as partly explanative in the analysis part where the literature and empirical findings are put together. The research is performed by gathering qualitative data through semi-structured in-depths interviews, observations and a case study at the company SportAlot. The writer of the thesis works for SportAlot and there is therefore a risk that the objectivity is biased, even if that is tried to eliminate. The research measures what it is intended to do, and if it is done once again it will most likely give the same result again. Within another context the result will not be exactly the same, but the method will provide the practitioner with the same validity and reliability in his or her result. The research is possible to generalize for companies within the retail business having the same type of cargo as well as the same transportation costs/volume from Europe to Sweden. It is hard to find literature showing how to prepare for transportation negotiation. Instead there are much more about organizational change, change management and the negotiation itself. Literature within these fields will support the thesis and set the theoretical framework within which the empirical data is gathered. The present problems found at the case company, SportAlot, is bad delivery precision, inadequate information, a lot of non-value-adding-time is spend on unnecessary things, the employees lacks trust in the forwarder, the informational lead times are long and the transports can be too expensive compared to other forwarders. The needs SportAlot has is better delivery precision, they require information, regular statistics, possibilities to track their goods and possibility to give the forwarder penalties when it does not act as agreed. The empirical part also presents statistical data from 2010 which is a base for the request for quotation sent to the forwarders. The thesis resulted in the importance of good management that supports changes and employees that are willing to improve their work. It is important for the negotiators to have knowledge about the negotiation itself so they are prepared when they come to the negotiation and can give a well informed impression to the other party. It is also important for negotiators to be well informed about other criteria which are up for discussion within transportation at the present time. Examples of that are ISO certificates, routing order and <b>customs</b> clearance <b>simplifications.</b> By using the weighted linear model the result from the literature and the answers on the request for quotation was that forwarders DSV and NH Logistics did perform well in the analysis and are recommended for SportAlot to meet for further negotiations based on the drivers for change. The drivers for change are: decrease price, improve lead times, improve delivery precision, improve communication, improve trust and set a good base for the relationship.

40|$|AbstractWithin the MEDNET project “Mediterranean Network for <b>Custom</b> Procedures and <b>Simplification</b> of Clearance in Ports” {{funded by}} the MED {{programme}} (2007 – 2013), Taranto Port Authority (TPA) in Italy has designed and developed newly automatic system (prototype) for an effective and seamless management of port operators enrolment and access in the port area. Taranto Port Authority developed and tested an effective Information Technologies (IT) based on a multi-user management tool with a single interface for all port operators. The interface is based on functionalities coming from the integration and re-engineering of two different procedures managed by TPA: 1) enrolment in the TPA's Register foreseen in art. 68 of the Italian Navigation Law, mandatory for all private companies and individuals operating in the port; 2) the procedure of issuing of passes for vehicles and people to enter in the port area. The scope of this initiative was to re-engineer the two aforementioned procedures into a single IT based procedure with a single management interface. It enables to accelerate the process for passes release {{as well as to}} improve port accessibility by reducing the number of potential errors and transforming the nature of the procedure from “preventive” to “fact-finding”. In this way, the port community of Taranto will be able to provide relevant services in less time. The prototype is able to speed up the issuing of passes for persons and vehicles entering in the port area by reducing the time needed to check documents provided by companies as well as informing relevant authorities. The developed prototype enables to automatically manage different categories of passes for entering in the port of Taranto: annual passes, provisional passes as well as visitors passes. The combined effect of the new local regulation (TPA's Ordinance no. 04 / 14 of April 28 th 2014) and the prototype enables to issue passes in 7 – 8 days against the previous 60 days required to complete (annual) pass request procedure. The benefits in terms of time saving have been also achieved for the other categories of passes (provisional and visitors). The prototype leads to seamless procedures management as well as to simplification of checks in entering in the port area. Streamlining procedures enables not only a reduction in terms of needed time for regular control of requests, but also a real-time control of the handled requests in parallel with the traditional ways (paper protocols). Taranto Port Authority {{as well as the other}} competent bodies are now able to check each single person and vehicle accessing in the port of Taranto, improving actual procedure and related controls, through an efficient check-in/check-out reporting. Seamless administrative formalities related of both companies’ enrolment and passes requests enable to reach an overall improvement of port accessibility and transit of vehicles and goods in the area, positively affecting its competiveness as well as quality of provided added-value services. The prototype is able to significantly reduce relevant administrative and bureaucratic aspects. Simplification of the procedures is expected to positively influence the door-to-door transport time and costs for business accessing and circulating in the port area and beyond...|$|R
