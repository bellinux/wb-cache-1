It is about fifteen feet long, high and pointed at both ends, is {{a foot and a half}} or two feet deep, and so narrow that if you wedged a fat man into it you might not get him out again. It sits on top of the water like a duck, but it has an outrigger and does not upset easily, if you keep still. This outrigger is formed of two long bent sticks like plow handles, which project from one side, and to their outer ends is bound a <b>curved</b> <b>beam</b> composed of an extremely light wood, which skims along the surface of the water and thus saves you from an upset on that side, while the outrigger's weight is not so easily lifted as to make an upset on the other side a thing to be greatly feared. Still, until one gets used to sitting perched upon this knifeblade, he is apt to reason within himself that it would be more comfortable if there were just an outrigger or so on the other side also. I had the bow seat, and Billings sat amidships and faced the Kanaka, who occupied the stern of the craft and did the paddling. With the first stroke the trim shell of a thing shot out from the shore like an arrow. There was not much to see. While we were on the shallow water of the reef, it was pastime to look down into the limpid depths at the large bunches of branching coral--the unique shrubbery of the sea. We lost that, though, when we got out into the dead blue water of the deep. But we had the picture of the surf, then, dashing angrily against the crag-bound shore and sending a foaming spray high into the air.|$|E

40|$|Most dynamic {{analyses}} of planar curved beams {{found in the}} literature are carried out based on a <b>curved</b> <b>beam</b> model which assumes that the neutral axis coincides with the centroidal axis of the <b>curved</b> <b>beam.</b> This assumption leads to governing equations of motion which are relatively simple with analysis results that have acceptable accuracy for shallow curved beams. However, when a <b>curved</b> <b>beam</b> is not shallow and/or its cross section is not doubly symmetric, the offset distance between the neutral and centroidal axes may be large enough to influence the in-plane dynamics of the <b>curved</b> <b>beam</b> even for small motion. In this paper, the validity of this underlying assumption for modeling a linear <b>curved</b> <b>beam</b> is examined. To this end, two sets of equations of motion governing the in-plane dynamics of a planar <b>curved</b> <b>beam</b> are derived, in a consistent manner for comparison, based on the linear strain–displacement relations and Hamilton’s principle. The first set of equations is derived from the displacement components measured with reference to the neutral axis of the <b>curved</b> <b>beam</b> while the second set is derived with respect to the centroidal axis of the cross section. The <b>curved</b> <b>beam</b> is considered extensional and the effects of rotary inertia and radial shear deformation are included. In addition to the curvature parameter that characterizes the wave motion for both <b>curved</b> <b>beam</b> models, an eccentricity parameter is introduced in the first model to account for the offset between the neutral and centroidal axes. The dynamic behavior predicted by each <b>curved</b> <b>beam</b> model is compared in terms of the dispersion relations, frequency spectra, cutoff frequencies, natural frequencies and modeshapes, and frequency responses. In order to ensure that the comparison is accurate, the wave propagation technique is applied to obtain exact wave solutions.

First, the governing equations are derived for linear elastic <b>curved</b> <b>beams</b> with uniformly loaded based on the Timoshenko-Reissner-Mindlin hypotheses. Then, standard and mixed variational problems are formulated. A new norm, equivalent to H¹- type norm, is introduced. By making use of this norm, sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the above problems are established for both continuous and discrete cases. The estimates of the optimal order and minimal regularity are then derived for errors in the generalised displacement vector and the internal force vector. These analytical findings are compared with numerical results, verifying the role of reduced integration and {{the accuracy of the}} methods...|$|R

As doubly ruled surfaces, they {{can be made with}} a lattice of straight beams, hence are easier to build than curved surfaces that do not have a ruling and must instead be built with <b>curved</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|R
