Indeed, it appears that no rigorous and definitive study has yet been published in this field. Several such investigations with well conceived research designs {{are known to be}} in process at the Institute of Developmental Studies in New York City, in the public school systems of Baltimore and Detroit, and elsewhere. Currently available, however, are only a few careful and substantial—but largely inconclusive—studies, together with a much larger number of investigations which are more on the order of surveys than of hypothesis-testing research. This review discusses reports of 10 investigations directed toward assess-ment of the effects of <b>compensatory</b> <b>educational</b> programs and practices.

It was a descriptive and exploratory approach where the PRECEDE component of the PRECEDE/PROCEDE Model was used as the framework to systematize and analyze the information obtained from the focus group sessions.

In the first phase, a self-developed survey instrument {{was mailed to}} a stratified random sample of 1, 000 Presbyterian ministers. The survey instrument contained items relating to demographics, <b>educational</b> <b>strategies,</b> and techniques used when participating in continuing professional education. The data from 439 completed surveys was analyzed to determine if any significant relationships existed between gender, career choice and <b>educational</b> <b>strategies</b> and techniques used by Presbyterian ministers. The second phase consisted of telephone interviews with 12 Presbyterian ministers from the overall sample population. The interview consisted of questions relating to overall satisfaction with quality of available education strategies and techniques. Based on the data analysis and telephone interviews completed during this study, 4 conclusions were made. First, Presbyterian ministers are satisfied with the continuing professional education strategies and techniques that are available for their use. Second, {{there is no difference}} between gender, career choice and <b>educational</b> <b>strategies</b> and techniques of Presbyterian ministers in this study.

40|$|Although {{the growth}} of Islamic banking assets is still high, the market share of Islamic banking reached only ± 4, 92 % {{by the end of}} May 2014. Islamic banks should {{implement}} an appropriate strategy to face dynamic changes in the business environment. The education strategy is one of the business strategies of Islamic banks that remain a priority today. It provides information and understanding for society about the function, role, activities, and products as well as services of Islamic banks. This study examines the impact of fit between the education strategy and contingency variables (known as strategic-fit) on performance. The contingency variables include efficiency of input, organizational competency, CEO tenure, and composition of shariah supervisory board. The performance of Islamic banks consists of both financial and social performances. Using the data from 1997 to 2012 of 10 fully-fledge Islamic banks in Indonesia and least squares method, this study shows that the efficiency of input has a positive effect on the <b>educational</b> <b>strategy</b> implementation. On the other hand, the composition of shariah supervisory board and organizational competency negatively affect the implementation of the <b>educational</b> <b>strategy.</b> Nevertheless, there is no strong evidence that CEO tenure influences the implementation of the <b>educational</b> <b>strategy.</b> Adopting the method of Van de Ven and Drazin (1985) to determine the degree of strategic misfit, this study finds that the misfit between <b>educational</b> <b>strategy</b> and its contingency variables has a negative effect on financial performance, but no significant effect of misfit on social performance...|$|R
40|$|Educational {{practice}} and educational research are not aligned with each other. Current educational practice heavily relies on information transmission or content delivery to learners. Yet {{evidence shows that}} delivery is only a minor part of learning. To illustrate the directions we might take to find better <b>educational</b> <b>strategies,</b> six areas of educational evidence are briefly reviewed. The flipped classroom idea is proposed to shift our expenditure and focus in education. All information delivery could be web distributed, thus creating more time for other more expensive <b>educational</b> <b>strategies</b> to support the learner. In research our focus should shift from comparing one curriculum to the other, to research that explains why things work in education and under which conditions. This may generate ideas for creative designers to develop new <b>educational</b> <b>strategies.</b> These best practices should be shared and further researched. At the same time attention should be paid to implementation and the realization that teachers learn in a way {{very similar to the}} people they teach. If we take the evidence seriously, our educational practice will look quite different to the way it does now...|$|R

Teachers from specialized schools for gifted pupils have a stronger tendency to label them.
