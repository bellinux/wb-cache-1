An {{analytic}} pair of dimension n and <b>center</b> <b>V</b> {{is a pair}} (V,M) where M is {{a complex}} manifold of (complex) dimension n and V ⊂ M is a closed totally real analytic submanifold of dimension n. To an analytic pair (V,M) we associate the class U (V,M) of the functions u: M → [0,π/ 4 [which are plurisubharmonic in M and such that u(p) = 0 for each p ∈ V. If U (V,M) admits a maximal function u, the triple (V,M,u) {{is said to be}} a maximal plurisubharmonic model. After defining a pseudo-metric EV,M on the <b>center</b> <b>V</b> of an analytic pair (V,M) we prove (see Theorem 4. 1, Theorem 5. 1) that maximal plurisubharmonic models provide a natural generalization of the Monge-Ampère models introduced by Lempert and Szöke in [16]. 1...|$|R
