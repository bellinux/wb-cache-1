50|$|Traditionally, customs {{records are}} {{the main source of}} {{statistical}} data on international trade.

This agreement between the Czechoslovak State Railways (ČSD) and Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR) provided that the handover of all cross-border trains would take place in Bad Schandau and so the station became a border station handling frontier and <b>customs</b> <b>formalities</b> for cross-border freight and passenger traffic.|$|R

At the Pakistani frontier post, travelers were advised not to wander away from the road, as the location was a barely controlled Federally Administered Tribal Area. Then, after <b>customs</b> <b>formalities,</b> a quick daylight drive through the Pass was made. Monuments left by British Army units, as well as hillside forts, could be viewed from the highway.|$|R
5000|$|Tiraspol {{has raised}} the {{restoration}} {{of its ability to}} export Transnistrian goods without supervision by Moldova as a precondition. At present, Chisinau allows companies in Transnistria to export goods subject to <b>customs</b> <b>formalities</b> in Chisinau, charging only a token fee for doing so. This procedure was introduced under EU influence, in order to ensure the transparency of commercial operations. At the same time, Tiraspol has openly declared that it will negotiate with Moldova only in order to “normalise” bilateral relations and not to reintegrate Transnistria with Moldova. The tactic employed by Tiraspol (and Russia, which supports it) is to make a mere formal concession (agreement to enter formal negotiations) in exchange for extracting a real concession from Moldova (granting Transnistria the right to conduct foreign economic relations).|$|R

50|$|Even where consent {{is given}} for {{humanitarian}} operations, {{there are often}} problems with visas and travel restrictions. Disaster personnel are often granted entry on tourist or other temporary visas, which can cause subsequent problems with renewal and efforts to obtain work permits. <b>Customs</b> <b>formalities</b> are also a frequent problem, with relief goods held up {{for long periods of}} time waiting for clearance. The recognition of domestic legal status is another common problem for international relief providers, particularly for NGOs and foreign Red Cross or Red Crescent societies. The processes are often too slow or difficult to negotiate in emergency settings. Unregistered organisations face various problems, including difficulty opening bank accounts, hiring staff, obtaining visas for workers and tax exemptions. Bilateral agreements, negotiated in advance of an emergency, can be of significant assistance in addressing these issues. Without an agreement is in place, there is little guidance at the international level beyond the general obligation to facilitate aid.|$|R
5000|$|In Basel {{and between}} Erzingen and Thayngen the line {{runs through the}} Swiss cantons of Basel and Schaffhausen. Construction and {{operation}} of these routes is governed by an international treaty between Switzerland and Baden and later Germany. It treats {{the operation of the}} line as a [...] "single continuous main line". Thus it was possible for the Baden State Railways to operate through the fringes of Switzerland {{in the same way as}} on Baden territory, which was not normal at that time. Switzerland agreed not to impose tariffs on freight in transit or to subject trains on the line to <b>customs</b> <b>formalities.</b> The treaty of 1852 also makes a provision for Switzerland to acquire the line, but Switzerland has never used this provision. The tracks in Switzerland largely are operated under German regulations, so that the trains run on the right and the tracks are—with the exception of Schaffhausen station—controlled by signals of German design.|$|R
5000|$|On 15 December 1846, {{passenger}} services were extended to Hamburg and freight traffic {{began in the}} new year. Originally, the station in Wendisch Warnow served only for the carrying out of <b>customs</b> <b>formalities,</b> but it was released after a short time, probably as early as 1847, for public transport. In passenger transport, passengers were checked on the train between Wendisch Warnow and Wittenberge and their luggage had to be stowed in the baggage car {{with the exception of}} hand luggage before reaching Wendisch Warnow. Freight traffic was checked at the stations in Wendisch Warnow, Wittenberge and Berlin. Wendisch Warnow was primarily responsible for the control and taxation of cattle imported into Prussia. In 1855, 16,019 head of cattle were checked in Wendisch Warnow; a year earlier, only 5,678 head of cattle had been handled. It was said in relation to this significant increase at Wendisch Warnow and the adjacent border crossing on the road: ...|$|R

Considering the many situations that arise in carrying out intra-Community commercial transactions, that are aimed at the differentiated tax procedures from the value added tax perspective, we considered appropriate, to address below the tax features related to intra-Community acquisitions and supplies of new means of transport and excisable products, because these are two important categories of goods that generate differential tax treatments, so that after the tax analysis we should be able to draw some relevant conclusions...|$|R
