Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection has been observed in male mice making mate choices of females with different MHCs and thus demonstrating sexual selection. Also, at least for MHC I presentation, there has been evidence of antigenic peptide splicing which can combine peptides from different proteins, vastly increasing antigen diversity.|$|E

The inheritance of electrophoretically detectable enzymatic variation was studied by means of laboratory culture of Pileolaria pseudomilitaris and Janua brasiliensis. These variants are inherited as simple Mendelian <b>codominants</b> in single-pair matings. A small percentage of progeny from single-pair matings of each species are produced by self-fertilization in these hermaphroditic worms. Isolated individuals of P. pseudomilitaris produced reduced numbers of progeny with genotypes that confirmed self-fertilization by the parent. Isolated individuals of J. brasiliensis did not reproduce in culture. The high degree of polymorphism at several loci suggests that self-fertilization is not a common occurrence in natural populations...|$|R

A genome with three linkage groups simulated, each one with 11 molecular marks which were multi-allelic, <b>codominants,</b> with saturation of 10 cM. Starting from this genome, two situations were simulated: one with informative genitors, and other with genitors formed randomly. Once all the recombination frequencies were estimated, it was found out that in completely informative loci, the recombination frequency can be calculated among equal pairs of loci starting from the gametic frequency of each genitor, or starting from the genotipic frequency of the progeny. For partially informative loci, the recombination frequency starting from the united genotipic frequency is more appropriate...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Six {{stands of}} Eucalyptus regnans and E. delegatensis with {{significantly}} contagious or clumped spatial patterns, were observed between either ages 4 and 12 or ages 30 and 41 years. The effects of aggregation {{on the development}} of these stands are described. The prediction of growth and mortality responses of individual trees is demonstrated in these stands where average stand density measures are not good indicators of the competitive conditions which individual trees face. Results show that clumping intensifies competition, producing a high proportion of suppressed stems and substantial mortality even in regions of low average density. Average tree size is reduced. The bimodal diameter distribution illustrates the distinct separation of the suppressed class from the dominants and <b>codominants.</b> Individual tree growth differs significantly between crown classes. Basal area growth of the suppressed stems which survive averages near zero. In all crown classes variables which reflect competitive conditions such as distance to the nearest neighbouring tree and the basal area in larger trees are more successful predictors of individual tree growth than average stand density variables. Mortality is largely confined to the suppressed class and within any stand can be predicted by tree size and local density variables. The concentration of mortality in the densest parts of the stands is changing the spatial pattern, so that the degree of contagion is decreasing through time. A high degree of contagion results in increased variability of conditions within a stand and high local densities around some trees. The associated intensification in competition in these areas of the stand produces responses which are similar to those we would expect under an increase in general density...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{for the maintenance}} of coexistence of Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir in subalpine forests of the Colorado Front Range were examined by comparing age, size, and spatial distributions of spruce and fir in two adjacent, previously logged sites of differing moisture availability. Adult tree ages were calculated from stem cores, while seedling ages were calculated from a multiple regression equation based on diameter, height, and number of branch whorls. Tree size was measured by height and diameter; spatial distributions were described by Morisita 2 ̆ 7 s index of dispersion. Cumulative age and size distributions were significantly different in the two species, with greater longevity and a larger overall size in spruce than fir. Both species showed a significant linear relationship between size and age, while fir showed a faster height growth rate than spruce. The linear relationship between age and size was much closer in seedlings than in adults. Seedling spatial distribution was highly clumped in both species, but mature trees showed little or no clumping. Because both species are mainly wind dispersed, the greater clumping in spruce than in fir seedlings suggests that spruce have more specific establishment requirements than fir. Colonization patterns indicated that spruce seedlings were primarily found in forest gaps or associated with fir canopy trees, while fir seedlings were more commonly found in the forest, associated with either spruce or fir canopy trees. Tree density, growth rates, and mortality rates were higher in the wet site, with spruce showing the largest between site differences. These data suggest a new hypothesis for coexistence stating that Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir are maintained as <b>codominants</b> because the greater longevity and size of spruce is balanced by the faster height growth and more flexible seedling establishment requirements of fir...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{quantified}} {{the effects}} of local neighbourhood competition, light availability, and proximity to skid trails on the growth of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) trees following selection harvest. We hypothesized that growth would increase with decreasing competition and increasing light availability, but that proximity to skid trails would negatively affect growth. A total of 300 sugar maples were sampled ∼ 10 years after selection harvesting in 18 stands in Témiscamingue (Québec, Canada). Detailed tree and skid trail maps were obtained in one 0. 4 ha plot per stand. Square-root transformed radial growth data were fitted to a linear mixed model that included tree diameter, crown position, a neighbourhood competition index, light availability (estimated using the SORTIE light model), and distance to the nearest skid trail as explanatory variables. We considered various distance-dependent or -independent indices based on neighbourhood radii ranging from 6 to 12 m. The competition index that provided the best fit to the data was a distance-dependent index computed in a 6 m search radius, but a distance-independent version of the competition index provided an almost equivalent fit to data. Models corresponding to all combinations of main effects were fit to data using maximum likelihood, and weighted averages of parameter estimates were obtained using multimodel inference. All predictors had an influence on growth, {{with the exception of}} light. Radial growth decreased with increasing tree diameter, level of competition and proximity to skid trails, and varied among crown positions with trees in suppressed and intermediate positions having lower growth rates than <b>codominants</b> and dominants. Our results indicate that in selection managed stands, the radial growth of sugar maple trees depends on competition from close (≤ 6 m) conspecific neighbours, and is still affected by proximity to skid trails ∼ 10 years after harvesting. Such results underscore the importance of minimizing the extent of skid trail networks by careful pre-harvest planning of trail layout. We also conclude that the impact of heterogeneity among individual-tree neighbourhoods, such as those resulting from alternative spatial patterns of harvest, can usefully be integrated into models of post-harvest tree growth...|$|R
40|$|The large-crowned {{emergent}} tree Microberlinia bisulcata dominates {{rain forest}} groves at Korup National Park, Cameroon, {{along with two}} <b>codominants,</b> Tetraberlinia bifoliolata and T. korupensis. M. bisulcata has a pronounced modal size frequency distribution around 110 cm stem diameter: its recruitment potential is very poor. It is a long-lived light-demanding species, one of many found in African forests. Tetraberlinia species lack modality, are more shade tolerant, and recruit better. All three species are ectomycorrhizal. M. bisulcata dominates grove basal area, {{even though it has}} similar numbers of trees (≥ 50 cm stem diameter) as each of the other two species. This situation presented a conundrum that prompted a long-term study of grove dynamics. Enumerations of two plots (82. 5 and 56. 25 ha) between 1990 and 2010 showed mortality and recruitment of M. bisulcata to be very low (both rates 0. 2 % per year) compared with Tetraberlinia (2. 4 % and 0. 8 % per year), and M. bisulcata grows twice as fast as the Tetraberlinia. Ordinations indicated that these three species determined community structure by their strong negative associations while other species showed almost none. Ranked species abundance curves fitted the Zipf-Mandelbrot model well and allowed “overdominance” of M. bisulcata to be estimated. Spatial analysis indicated strong repulsion by clusters of large (50 to < 100 cm) and very large (≥ 100 cm) M. bisulcata of their own medium-sized (10 to < 50 cm) trees and all sizes of Tetraberlinia. This was interpreted as competition by M. bisulcata increasing its dominance, but also inhibition of its own replacement potential. Stem coring showed a modal age of 200 years for M. bisulcata, but with large size variation (50 – 150 cm). Fifty-year model projections suggested little change in medium, decreases in large, and increases in very large trees of M. bisulcata, accompanied by overall decreases in medium and large trees of Tetraberlinia species. Realistically increasing very-large-tree mortality led to grove collapse without short-term replacement. M. bisulcata most likely depends on climatic events to rebuild its stands: the ratio of disturbance interval to median species' longevity is important. A new theory of transient dominance explains how M. bisulcata may be cycling in abundance over time and displaying nonequilibrium dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The indices found are {{analysed}} as a {{whole and}} general conclusions are drawn from them which may be of use in understanding many of the problems offered by the local flora (Ilhéus). The first column of the tables presented indicates the biological form of the species, showing the nature of the flora and the constitution of the climax. A total of 200 species of phanerophyta were found; 69 macrophanerophyta (trees), 54 are mesophanerophyta (treelets) and 77 are nanophanerophyta (shrubs). The macrophanerophyta are consequently considered as dominants and the meso-and nanophanerophyta as <b>codominants</b> (the biological forms: chamaephyta, hemicriptophyta, criptophyta, geophyta, therophyta, epiphyta and hydrophyta are subdominants), the more so as the first cover 80 % and the others more or less 50 %. This points to a climax of trees and a local vegetation mainly composed of trees also. The smaller forms are left out as they are beyond the present scope of this sort of wort in Brazil. The third column of ecological formulae indicates the reaction of the constituent species to light (C = sciophilous, F = photophilous and I = indifferents), the biological types of vegetation (H = hygrophytes, X = xerophytes and M = mesophytes) and the fidelity of the species to the climax. Of the species studied: 25 are pioneers (P. Table I), 63 are accidentals (A. Table II), 35 are companion species (O. Table III), 19 show preferences (E. Table with vitality Vn), 44 are selective (S. Table V) and 13 exclusive species (L. Table VI). This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} vegetation of the region is in full reconstitution. As to the ecological characteristics of the 200 species studied, 89 are either pioneers (a class separated by the author) or accidentals; this means that the devastated zones are being reconstituted in the subsere both with members of the prisere and alien species. Of the remaining species, 54 are companion, or accompanying species, which appear in most subclimax, serclímax and quasiclimax associations, and 57 are real constituents of the local climax. As all the species except the pioneers, selectives and exclusives (xerophytes and mesophytes) may be considered as hygrophytes this type evidently predominantes in the region and may constitute a hygrophilous serclimax and quasiclímax. In regard to light 101 are sciophilous, 32 indiferents and 67 photophilous. This leads to the conclusion that the vegetation comprises mainly tolerant species, showing the hygrophilous and mesophilous character of the region with a vegetation composed mostly of trees. The presence a large number of sciophilous species is easy to understand as the hygrophilous and mesophilous habitats and the dominance of trees favour the germination and growth of tolerant species. The last two columns analyse the percentage of individuals present and the occurrent classes to which they belong: 92 species vary between 1 and 9 %; 50 between to 10 and 19 %; 36 between 20 and 29 %; 14 between 30 and 39 %; and 8 between 40 and 49 %. Only 8 species belong to occurrence class V; 14 to classe IV; 36 to class III; 50 to class II; and 92 to class I. This leads to the conclusion that the local formation is very unsociable and very complex, though the median coverture is 80 % and the number of species is very large. The analysis of the data also shows that the climax is being reconstituted in the subsere with elements drawn from the prisere and alien species introduced either by man (following desvastation) or by other consequent factors (such as brusque changes of microclimates due to total or partial destruction). This modifies the subclimax appreciably and apparently also the climax of the local regional subsere. As a final conclusion it is suggested that as in the subsere the pioneer formation is xerophilous, the prisere also beging as a xerosere; but as there are and probably always were hydrophilous formation evolving in the same climate, the local climax is composed of species with medium exactions, that is of relative mesophites...|$|R
