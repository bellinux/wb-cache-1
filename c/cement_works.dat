5|$|Tourism is {{the major}} local {{employment}} for park residents (24%), with manufacturing industries (19%) and quarrying (12%) also being important. 12% are employed in agriculture. The <b>cement</b> <b>works</b> at Hope is the largest single employer within the park. Tourism is estimated to provide 500 full-time jobs, 350 part-time jobs and 100 seasonal jobs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main Victorian rail network of the Victorian Railways and successors, a number of narrow gauge private railways and tramways have also existed for logging and mining purposes. These included the Yallourn 900mm Railway in the Latrobe Valley open cut coal mines, the Fyansford <b>Cement</b> <b>Works</b> Railway near Geelong, the Tyers Valley Tramway at Mount Baw Baw, and the Powelltown Tramway from Yarra Junction.|$|E
5|$|Few railway tunnels {{exist in}} Victoria, with the {{exception}} of the Melbourne City Loop. The longest tunnel before the opening of the loop was on the Fyansford <b>Cement</b> <b>Works</b> Railway (near Geelong), where a 1300 metre long tunnel existed on a narrow gauge quarry railway. Of those open today the longest is the single track 422 metre long Geelong Tunnel, followed by the double track 385 metre Elphinstone and the 390 metre long Big Hill Tunnels on the Bendigo line. A 154 metre long tunnel also exists on the Healesville line, as well as three tunnels on the suburban Hurstbridge line, and another on the freight lines under Footscray station.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1904 {{he built}} the Chalet de Catllaràs, in La Pobla de Lillet, for the Asland cement factory, owned by Eusebi Güell. It has a simple {{structure}} though very original, {{in the shape}} of a pointed arch, with two semi-circular flights of stairs leading to the top two floors. This building fell into ruin when the <b>cement</b> <b>works</b> closed, and when it was eventually restored its appearance was radically altered, the ingenious original staircase being replaced with a simpler metal one. In the same area he created the Can Artigas Gardens between 1905 and 1907, in an area called Font de la Magnesia, commissioned by the textile merchant Joan Artigas i Alart; men who had worked the Park Güell were also involved on this project, similar to the famous park in Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|The Triassic rocks {{consist of}} red marls, sandstones, breccias and {{conglomerates}} which {{spread over the}} older rocks. The Dolomitic Conglomerate is an old shingle beach of Keuper Marl age. The Rhaetic Beds are full of fossils due to invasion of the Jurassic Sea. The Lias consists of clays and limestones, the latter being quarried and are famous for their fossils. Blue Lias was burnt locally to provide a source of lime for making lime mortar. It is still used as a decorative building stone. Blue Lias {{is believed to have}} been quarried on the Polden Hills as early as the 15th century and was quarried in Puriton from the early 19th century until 1973, when the local <b>cement</b> <b>works</b> closed.|$|E

It can reach excellent properties if mixing the two materials with each other. The <b>cement</b> <b>worked</b> as filler in PVC, as shown the mechanical tests. The oxygen index was determined, accordingly the result show higher oxygen index value. That means the blend shows higher fire resistance comparing to neat PVC. The <b>cement</b> <b>worked</b> as a structural modifier, it caused modification in the blends structure and properties. From the mechanical tests, such as impact-, tensile-, flexural- and hardness tests the blend gives similar mechanical properties to neat PVC.

The site was taken over by the British Portland Cement Company in 1900 and works continued until 1920. In 1910 the Alpha <b>Cement</b> <b>Works</b> was constructed by the Thames Portland Cement Company. The site was exhausted by 1950 and was flooded as quarrying activities exceeded the depth of the water table. A second quarry was begun to the north of Salt Lane on the edge of the marshes.|$|E
