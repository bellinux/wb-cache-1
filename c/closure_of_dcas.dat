40|$|The {{relations}} between the concentration <b>of</b> deoxycholic acid (<b>DCA),</b> the cholesterol saturation index, and the nucleation time in gall bladder bile were measured to determine the role <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> in bile in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gall stone disease. Bile was obtained from patients with cholesterol gall stones (n = 30), subjects without gall stones (n = 35), and patients with pigment gall stones (n = 9). Three of 30 cholesterol gall stone patients and 10 of 35 gall stone free subjects were treated with antibiotics by mouth to decrease the concentration <b>of</b> bile <b>DCA</b> and determine the effect <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> on biliary lithogenecity. Both the percentage and concentration <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> in bile were similar in patients with and without cholesterol gall stones despite significant differences in their cholesterol saturation indices and nucleation times. Neither the percentage nor the concentration <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> in bile correlated with either the cholesterol saturation index or the nucleation time. Analysis of subgroups with matching cholesterol saturation indices showed no correlation between the proportion <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> in the bile and the cholesterol nucleation time. The proportion <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> in bile was decreased by antibiotic treatment, but this {{had no effect on}} the cholesterol saturation index or nucleation time. These results suggest that DCA in bile is not responsible for biliary cholesterol saturation or cholesterol nucleation time...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Evidence that {{indicates}} bile acid is a promoter {{of colon cancer}} exists. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) modifies apoptosis or proliferation by affecting intracellular signaling and gene expression. However, because previous studies {{have been based on}} studies on colon cancer cell lines, the effect <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> on normal colonocytes is unknown. Methods: Normal colonocytes and Caco- 2 and HCT 116 cells were treated with 20 μM and 250 μM <b>of</b> <b>DCA,</b> and the effect of different concentrations <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> was measured based on the expression of cell-cycle-related proteins by using Western blots. Results: The expressions of CDK 2 and cyclin D 1 for different concentrations <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> in normal colonocytes and colon cancer cells were similar, but the expressions of cyclin E and A were significantly different. In HCT 116 colon cancer cells, the expression of cyclin E increased regardless <b>of</b> the <b>DCA</b> concentration, but in normal colonocytes and Caco- 2 cells, the expression of cyclin E was not changed or decreased. In HCT 116 colon cancer cells, the expression of cyclin A was not changed or decreased regardless <b>of</b> the <b>DCA</b> concentration, but in normal colonocytes and Caco- 2 cells, the expression of cyclin A was increased at a <b>DCA</b> concentration <b>of</b> 20 μM. Conclusion: The effect <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> on stimulating cell proliferation suggests that DNA synthesis is stimulated by an increased expression of cyclin E in colon cancer cells. Our results suggest that a low dose <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> induces cellular proliferation through increased expression of cyclin A and that a high dose <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> induces decreased expression of cyclin E and CDK 2 in normal colonocytes...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of dynamic channel {{allocation}} (DCA) in cellular network is discussed. We draw the conclusion about it that the system performance improvement by DCA is that DCA increases the trunking efficiency and a simple but useful method is developed to calculate the lower limit of call blocking probability <b>of</b> <b>DCA.</b> By using this method, we can compare the performance of Fixed Channel Allocation (FCA) with any kinds <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> schemes easily and clearly.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{pharmacokinetics}} <b>of</b> dichloroacetate (<b>DCA)</b> in naive rats and rats depleted of glutathione S-transferase-zeta (GST-zeta), at doses approaching human daily exposure levels. We also compared in vitro metabolism <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> by rat and human liver cytosol. Jugular vein-cannulated male Fischer- 344 rats received graded doses <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> ranging from 0. 05 to 20 mg/kg (intravenously or by gavage), and we collected time-course blood {{samples from the}} cannulas. GST-zeta activity was depleted by exposing rats to 0. 2 g/L DCA in drinking water for 7 days before initiation of pharmacokinetic studies. Elimination <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> by naive rats was so rapid that only 1 - 20 mg/kg intravenous and 5 and 20 mg/kg gavage doses provided plasma concentrations above the method detection limit of 6 ng/mL. GST-zeta depletion slowed DCA elimination from plasma, allowing kinetic analysis of doses as low as 0. 05 mg/kg. DCA elimination was strongly dose dependent in the naive rats, with total body clearance declining with increasing dose. In the GST-zeta-depleted rats, the pharmacokinetics became linear at doses {{less than or equal}} to 1 mg/kg. Virtually all of the dose was eliminated through metabolic clearance; the rate of urinary elimination was < 1 mL/hr/kg. At higher oral doses ({{less than or equal to}} 5 mg/kg in GST-zeta-depleted and 20 mg/kg in naive rats), secondary peaks in the plasma concentration appeared long after the completion of the initial absorption phase. Oral bioavailability <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> was 0 - 13 % in naive and 14 - 75 % in GST-zeta- depleted rats. Oral bioavailability <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> in humans through consumption of drinking water was predicted to be very low and < 1 %. The use of the GST-zeta-depleted rat as a model for assessing the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> in humans is supported by the similarity in pharmacokinetic parameter estimates and rate of in vitro metabolism <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> by human and GST-zeta-depleted rat liver cytosol...|$|R
40|$|Conflicting {{data have}} been {{published}} related to the formation <b>of</b> dichloroacetate (<b>DCA)</b> from trichloroethylene (TRI), chloral hy-drate (CH), or trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in B 6 C 3 F 1 mice. TCA is usually indicated as the primary metabolic precursor to DCA. Model simulations based on the known pharmacokinetics <b>of</b> TCA and <b>DCA</b> predicted blood concentrations <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> that were 10 - to 100 -fold lower than previously published reports. Because DCA {{has also been shown}} to form as an artifact during sample process-ing, we reevaluated the source <b>of</b> the reported <b>DCA,</b> i. e., whether it was metabolically derived or formed as an artifact. Male B 6 C 3 F 1 mice were dosed with TRI, CH, trichloroethanol (TCE), or TCA and metabolic profiles of each were determined. DCA was not detected in any of these samples above the assay LOQ of 1. 9 fiM of whole blood.

40|$|Mineralization of {{free and}} of humus-bound 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (DCA) by a Pseudomonas putida strain {{isolated}} by analog enrichment was greatly enhanced {{in the presence}} of aniline. The addition of aniline to soil that contained 0. 2 to 100 micrograms <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> per g in free or in humus-bound form increased the mineralization rates <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> severalfold. Within the concentration ranges tested, absolute mineralization <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> per unit time was positively correlated with both increasing DCA and increasing aniline concentrations. The specific enrichment of microbial populations and the induction of pathways that can co-metabolize DCA are the most plausible explanations for the effect of aniline.

40|$|Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a {{synthetic}} compound that promotes {{the activity of}} pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) by inhibiting its repressor protein called pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK). The activation of PDH leads {{to a reduction in}} ambient cellular lactate concentrations both in vitro and in vivo which contributes to the therapeutic use <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> in the treatment of systemic lactic acidosis in humans. The therapeutic potential <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> is now being explored in disorders that are accompanied by elevations of lactate concentration such as in hypoxic cancer cells. Yet conflicting evidence regarding its mutagenic potential has been a major setback in its clinical trials. Hence, docking and descriptor analysis <b>of</b> halogen substituted <b>DCA</b> analogues were performed to find out a drug candidate with less toxicity and better binding affinity than DCA. The Docking analysis was carried out using human PDHK isozyme 2, the physiological receptor for DCA.

A drug-eluting stent was subsequently implanted, and the procedure was completed successfully without any complications. The extracted plaques and artificial materials were pathologically examined, and no inflammatory changes were detected on plaques adjacent to the material. Assessing pathological findings and structure <b>of</b> the <b>DCA</b> catheter, the obtained artificial materials were considered as peeled guidewire, possibly resulting from the friction between the guidewire and metallic bearing in the housing <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> catheter. <b>Of</b> note, this phenomenon has been recognized even in other DCA cases in which guidewires of the other kind are used. We report this phenomenon for the first time, warning of theoretically possible distal embolization of artificial materials caused by any debulking devices...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric dicarboxylic acids (DCA) are a {{ubiquitous}} {{water-soluble component}} of secondary organic aerosols (SOA), which {{can act as}} cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), affecting the Earth's climate. Despite the high abundances of oxalic acid and related compounds in the marine aerosols, {{there is no consensus}} on what controls their distributions over the open ocean. Marine biological productivity could {{play a role in the}} production <b>of</b> <b>DCA,</b> but there is no substantial evidence to support this hypothesis. Here we present latitudinal distributions <b>of</b> <b>DCA,</b> oxoacids and -dicarbonyls in the marine aerosols from the remote Pacific. Their concentrations were found several times higher in more biologically influenced aerosols (MBA) than less biologically influenced aerosols. We propose isoprene and unsaturated fatty acids as sources <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> as inferred from significantly higher abundances of isoprene-SOA tracers and azelaic acid in MBA.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that the administration <b>of</b> desoxycorticosterone acetate (<b>DCA)</b> {{to a wide variety}} of species including man may lead to the development of hypertension (1, 2). Because of the obvious possible implications of this finding in essential hypertension in man, a considerable body of literature has accumulated concerning both the mechanism <b>of</b> action <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> and the conditions under which the steroid exerts its characteristic effects. Despite a considerable parallel between the effects <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> and the findings in the human disease, only indirect evidence links essential hypertension to the DCA-induced condition (3). A distinct barrier to a direct linkage between the two conditions still remains in the fact that there is little proof of adrenal cortical hypersecretion in most instances of essential hypertension. In studying this problem we noted that there was little information concerning the course <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> hypertension once treatment with the steroid was discontinued. It seemed to us that, under certain circumstances, exposure to DCA might well be followed by irreversible changes and a sustained hypertension...|$|R
40|$|The effect <b>of</b> {{desoxycorticosterone}} acetate (<b>DCA)</b> on the granulation tissue of healing and healed linear laparotomy wounds was studied in young adult male guinea pigs maintained on a complete diet {{and on a}} known intake <b>of</b> ascorbic acid. <b>DCA</b> induces the production of an excessive amount of granulation tissue, as evidenced by a relatively great number of fibroblasts and by a larger amount of ground substance. This effect {{was accompanied by a}} slight to moderate lag in the maturation process of both cellular and intercellular elements. These changes were observed when DCA administration was begun 5 days prior to operation, but were less obvious or absent if DCA was injected, beginning on the 5 th or 10 th postoperative day. The results indicate that the action <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> on immature, proliferating connective tissue is marked, and is considerably less or absent when connective tissue elements have reached partial or almost complete maturity. The effect <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> on connective tissue does not appear to rest on the basis of an altered nutritional status. Chemical and histochemical studies of the adrenals suggest that the action <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> on connective tissue is probably mediated through a disturbance of adrenocortical function, namely an imbalance between hormones of the zona glomerulosa (excess <b>of</b> <b>DCA)</b> and those <b>of</b> the zona fasciculata (deficiency of glucocorticoids). The presence of changes in granulation tissue and the lack of them in mature resting connective tissue of DCA-treated guinea pigs confirm the view that a profound difference in the response mechanism exists between resting and actively proliferating connective tissue...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} implicates prolonged intestinal transit (slow transit constipation) in {{the pathogenesis}} of conventional gallbladder stones (GBS), and that of gallstones induced by long term octreotide (OT) treatment. Both groups of GBS patients have multiple abnormalities in the lipid composition and physical chemistry of their gallbladder bile - associated with, and possibly due to, an increased proportion <b>of</b> deoxycholic acid (<b>DCA)</b> (percentage <b>of</b> total bile acids). In turn, this increase in the percentage <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> {{seems to be a}} consequence of prolonged colonic transit. Thus, in acromegalic patients OT treatment significantly prolongs large bowel transit time (LBTT) and leads to an associated increase of the percentage <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> in fasting serum (and, by implication, in gallbladder bile). LBTT is linearly related to the percentage <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> in fasting serum and correlates significantly with DCA input (into the enterohepatic circulation) and DCA pool size. However, these adverse effects of OT can be overcome by the concomitant use of the prokinetic drug cisapride, which normalizes LBTT and prevents the rise in the percentage <b>of</b> serum <b>DCA.</b> Therefore, in OT-treated patients and other groups at high risk of developing stones, {{it may be possible to}} prevent GBS formation with the use of intestinal prokinetic drugs...|$|R

40|$|Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a {{potential}} environmental hazard and an investigational drug. Repeated doses <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> result in re-duced drug clearance, probably through inhibition of glutathi-one transferase 1 (GSTZ 1), a cytosolic enzyme that converts DCA to glyoxylate. DCA {{is known to be}} taken up by mitochon-dria, where it inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, its major pharmacodynamic target. We tested the hypothesis that the mitochondrion was also a site <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> biotransformation. Im-munoreactive GSTZ 1 was detected in liver mitochondria from humans and rats, and its identity was confirmed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the tryptic peptides. Study of rat submitochondrial fractions re-vealed GSTZ 1 to be localized in the mitochondrial matrix. The specific activity of GSTZ 1 -catalyzed dechlorination <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> was 2. 5 - to 3 -fold higher in cytosol than in whole mitochondria and was directly proportional to GSTZ 1 protein expression in the two compartments. Rat mitochondrial GSTZ 1 had a 2. 5 -fold higher AppKm for glutathione than cytosolic GSTZ 1, whereas the AppKm values for DCA were identical. Rats administered DCA at a dose of 500 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks showed reduced hepatic GSTZ 1 activity and expression of 10 % of control levels in both cytosol and mitochondria.

50|$|Dollar cost {{averaging}} {{is not the}} same thing as continuous, automatic investing. This confusion of terms is perpetuated by some articles (AARP, Motley Fool) and specifically noted by others (Vanguard). The argued weakness <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> arises in the context of having the option to invest a lump sum, but choosing to use DCA instead. If the market is expected to trend upwards over time, DCA can conversely be expected to face a statistical headwind: the investor is choosing to invest at a future time rather than today, even though future prices are expected to be higher. But most individual investors, especially in the context of retirement investing, never face a choice between lump sum investing and DCA investing with a significant amount of money. The disservice arises when these investors take the criticisms <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> to mean that timing the market is better than continuously and automatically investing a portion of their income as they earn it. For example, stopping one's retirement investment contributions during a declining market on account of the argued weaknesses <b>of</b> <b>DCA</b> would indicate a misunderstanding of those arguments.|$|R
