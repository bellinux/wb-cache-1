40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{important}} parameter in {{a liquid}} scintillation (LS) event is {{the ratio of}} the number of electrons released at the cathode of a photomultiplier tube divided by the energy lost by the electron causing the fluorescence scintillation. We term this ratio the “scintillation figure of merit ” (SFM), and it depends both on the scintillation cocktail and the system used. High values enhance the counting efficiency of low-energy beta emitters and the energy resolution of alpha spectra. When the SFM is known, the counting efficiency of a dissolved beta emitter with a known energy spectrum can be calculated. It is difficult to measure this parameter using the modern 2 -tube <b>coincidence</b> <b>systems,</b> but easy with the flexible, single-phototube system described. A simple method is outlined to determine the SFM with useful accuracy for any LS system based on the energy res-olution of the pulse-height spectrum of 222 Rn and its decay products.

40|$|Gamma ray {{spectroscopy}} {{is routinely}} {{used to measure}} radiation {{in a number of}} situations. These include security applications, nuclear forensics studies, characterisation of radioactive sources, and environmental monitoring. For routine studies of environmental materials, the amount of radioactivity present is often very low, requiring spectroscopy systems which have to monitor the source for up to 7 days to achieve the required sensitivity. Recent developments in detector technology and data processing techniques have opened up the possibility of developing a highly efficient Compton Suppressed system, that was previously the preserve of large experimental collaborations. The accessibility of Monte-Carlo toolkits such as GEANT 4 also provide the opportunity to optimise these systems using computer simulations, greatly reducing the need for expensive (and inefficient) testing in the laboratory. This thesis details the development of such a Compton Suppressed, planar HPGe detector system. Using the GEANT 4 toolkit in combination with the experimental facilities at AWE, Aldermaston (which include HPGe detection systems, scintillator based detector systems, advanced shielding materials and gamma-gamma <b>coincidence</b> <b>systems),</b> simulations were built and validated to reproduce the detector response seen in the 'real-life' systems. This resulted in several improvements to the current system; for the shielding materials used, terrestrial and cosmic radiation were minimised, while reducing the X-ray fluorescence seen in the primary HPGe detector by an order of magnitude. With respect to the HPGe detector itself, an optimum thickness was identified for low energy (< 300 keV) radiation, which maximised the efficiency for the energy range of interest while minimising the interaction probability for higher energy radionuclides (which are the primary cause of the Compton continuum that obscures lower energy decays). A combination of secondary detectors were then optimised to design a Compton Suppression system for the primary detector, which could improve the performance of the current Compton Suppression system by an order of magnitude. This equates to a reduction of the continuum by up to a factor of 240 for a nuclide such as Co- 60, which is crucial for the detection of low-energy, low-activity emitters typically swamped by such a continuum. Finally, thoroughly optimised acquisition and analysis software has also been written to process data created by future high sensitivity gamma <b>coincidence</b> <b>systems.</b> This includes modules for the creation of histograms, coincidence matrices, and an ASCII to binary converter (for historical data) that has resulted in an analysis speed increase of up to 20000 times when compared to the software originally used for the extraction of coincidence information. Modules for low-energy time-walk correction and the removal of accidental coincidences are also included, which represent a capability that was not previously available...|$|R
