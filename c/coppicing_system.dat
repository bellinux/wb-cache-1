40|$|When {{eucalyptus}} {{trees are}} felled, new stems often grow from the stumps to produce another crop of trees. This new crop {{is called the}} coppice crop to distinguish it from the seedling crop. Coppice crops can be important in growing eucalypts profitably. Replanting costs are saved and coppice crop rotations are usually shorter than those of seedling crops, because coppice stems grow faster than seedlings. Several successive coppice crops are possible, but getting a coppice crop depends on planting the right species in the right environment and harvesting with the right method. PLAN FOR COPPICE The time to plan for a coppice crop is before planting the seedling crop. Not all eucalyptus species coppice. Choose a species that coppices vigorously and predictably, that grows well, and has the desired wood qualities. Eucalypts For Planting (FAO 1979) describes coppicing ability of species commonly used for wood production. However, relying on a species ' reputation for good coppicing is risky, because it might not coppice reliably everywhere. Also, the species may coppice well on average, but some seed sources may not. Before planting a new species in a new environment on a large scale, establish enough experimental plantings to determine coppicing ability at different seasons and ages by periodic fellings. Spacing and harvesting methods need to be carefully considered in developing a <b>coppicing</b> <b>system.</b> The spacing pattern must allow harvesting equipment to move about without damaging stumps. In irrigated plantations the harvesting plan must include protection of the irrigation system...|$|E

The New York based Salix Consortium project is a multi-partner endeavor, implemented in three stages. Phase-I, Final Design and Project Development, will conclude with the preparation of construction and/or operating permits, feedstock production plans, and contracts ready for signature. Field trials of willow (Salix) have been initiated at several locations in New York (Tully, Lockport, King Ferry, La Facette, Massena, and Himrod) and co-firing tests are underway at Greenidge Station (NYSEG). Phase-II of the project will focus on scale-up of willow crop acreage, construction of co-firing facilities at Dunkirk Station (NMPC), and final modifications for Greenidge Station. There will be testing of the energy crop as part of the gasification trials expected to occur at BED`s McNeill power station and potentially at one of GPU`s facilities. Phase-III will represent full-scale commercialization of the energy crop and power generation on a sustainable basis. Willow has been selected as the energy crop of choice for many reasons. Willow is well suited to the climate of the Northeastern United States, and initial field trials have demonstrated that the yields required for the success of the project are obtainable. Like other energy crops, willow has rural development benefits and could serve to diversify local crop production, provide new sources of income for participating growers, and create new jobs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Coppicing {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} forest management systems in Europe documented in prehistory as well as in the Middle Ages. However, coppicing was gradually abandoned by the mid- 20 (th) century, which has altered the ecosystem structure, diversity and function of coppice woods. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our aim was to disentangle factors shaping the historical growth dynamics of oak standards (i. e. mature trees growing through several coppice cycles) in a former coppice-with-standards in Central Europe. Specifically, we tried to detect historical coppicing events from tree-rings of oak standards, to link coppicing events with the recruitment of mature oaks, and to determine the effects of neighbouring trees on the stem increment of oak standards. Large peaks in radial growth found for the periods 1895 - 1899 and 1935 - 1939 matched with historical records of coppice harvests. After coppicing, the number of newly recruited oak standards markedly grew in comparison with the preceding or following periods. The last significant recruitment of oak standards was after the 1930 s following the last regular coppicing event. The diameter increment of oak standards from 1953 to 2003 was negatively correlated with competition indices, suggesting that neighbouring trees (mainly resprouting coppiced Tilia platyphyllos) partly suppressed the growth of oak standards. Our results showed that improved light conditions following historical coppicing events caused significant increase in pulses of radial growth and most probably maintained oak recruitment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our historical perspective carries important implications for oak management in Central Europe and elsewhere. Relatively intense cutting creating open canopy woodlands, either as in the <b>coppicing</b> <b>system</b> or in the form of selective cutting, is needed to achieve significant radial growth in mature oaks. It is also critical for the successful regeneration and long-term maintenance of oak populations...|$|E

40|$|<b>Coppice</b> <b>systems</b> are {{amongst the}} {{earliest}} forms of woodland management known and on some sites their use {{has been documented}} for centuries. Distinctive assemblages {{of plants and animals}} are associated with such systems and are highly valued in nature conservation terms. The richness of such assemblages, and conversely, the species that do not thrive under coppice, are linked to the alternation of relatively short light and dark phases and the juxtaposition of stands at different stages in the coppice cycle. We review how and why the biodiversity of former coppice woods changes in response to abandonment and conversion to high forest. We focus on the situation in the UK, based on recent published literature searches and the authors’ extensive experiences of the practical issues involved in the conservation of <b>coppice</b> woodland <b>systems.</b> Vascular plants in the ground flora, invertebrates of open glades and scrub, and small birds of the understorey may have become more abundant in coppice than they would have been under ‘natural’ forest conditions. By contrast epiphytes dependent on mature trees and species of large-sized deadwood are less favoured by <b>coppice</b> management. <b>Coppice</b> <b>systems</b> developed to meet the local community needs. As social and economic conditions changed, so coppicing declined and the woods were transformed into high forest through neglect or deliberate management. High forests differ from coppice stands in their spatial and temporal dynamics and consequently in their wildlife particularly with respect to their vertical structure pattern; extent of open space and young growth; spatial heterogeneity; tree and shrub composition; and browsing levels. Three issues for the conservation of biodiversity arise from these changes: • What priority and resources should be given to halting further decline, by maintaining coppice compared to allowing sites to develop with more ‘natural’ high forest structures and dynamics; will associated high-forest species recolonise? • If we restore <b>coppice</b> <b>systems,</b> will the species assemblages present in the past also recover, under current and future changes in environmental conditions; i. e is the transformation reversible under current environmental conditions? • Are there other ways in which ‘coppice-associated’ species might be maintained?

40|$|Though the {{importance}} of coppicing {{for the conservation of}} forest biodiversity is acknowledged, little is known about flora diversity and how it may be affected by the perceptions, constraints and regulations governing how loggers choose to exploit forest resources. Building on previous research on coppiced forests in the central Italian Apennines, unstructured and structured social surveys were performed along with structural and compositional vegetation sampling to determine how the ecology of the understory flora, where most of the biodiversity is found, may be affected by direct and indirect interactions between formal rules, namely Marche Region prescriptions, and informal rules applied in coppicing management. We identified economic/logistical and ecological variables that influence change in understory plant communities, particularly focusing on specialist forest species, and we explored how commercial, private and group property (Comunanza Agraria) loggers are influenced by these variables in deciding whether a forest is suitable for coppicing. Our insights on the relationships between the human and the ecological dimensions of the <b>coppicing</b> <b>system</b> suggest that the users prefer specific forest conditions because they facilitate efficient harvesting. These conditions also happen to be compatible with the life cycle of the specialist forest species in the ground flora. The stand attributes considered to be indicators of productivity drive decision making almost independently from (but largely compatibly with) formal rules. This is true across the three groups of loggers. These attributes seem to act as determinants of the conservation of the functional diversity of understory plant species, at plot and forest patch scale. We conclude that economically viable coppicing can occur after the stumps have been allowed to regenerate and grow beyond a certain diameter. This enables understory conditions favorable to forest specialist plants to re-establish and makes the present coppicing regime compatible with conservation of the diversity of these species in the forest landscape. © 2016 Elsevier B.

40|$|Onsite {{wastewater}} treatment systems {{play a vital}} role in the protection of surface waters, groundwater and drinking water supplies. In areas of low subsoil permeability, where traditional onsite systems are not appropriate, attention has turned to the use of zero-discharge willow {{wastewater treatment}} systems (ZDWS). In this thesis, field-scale, meso-scale and lab-scale experimental trials, in combination with field observational studies were carried out, towards the development of a novel ZDWS. Field studies on the use of a polytunnel-covered wetland system found that while evapotranspiration from covered willow systems decreased, the overall efficiency of wastewater removal increased, due to the prevention of incident rainfall from entering the wetland. The development of a novel, polytunnel-covered willowfree wetland system also showed promise, with evaporation rates approaching the evapotranspiration rates achieved by the wetlands containing willows. The use of a winter-active species, P. fragrans, to increase winter evapotranspiration was proposed and investigated. Trials found that, due to the inability of the species to tolerate short-duration waterlogging, the distribution of the species in free-draining soils and the low winter evapotranspiration, the use of P. fragrans in a zero-discharge system is not effective. In lysimeter trials, willows undergoing an annual <b>coppicing</b> <b>system,</b> necessary for a covered ZDWS, were found to have lower evapotranspiration rates than willows that were not coppiced. Soil clay percentage did not generally affect growth or evapotranspiration for trees undergoing the annual coppicing cycle. Willow crop factors, for use in the sizing of ZDWS in the south of Ireland, were established as part of this trial. Inoculation of the willow trees with a commercial mixed-species mycorrhizal fungal inoculum increased willow biomass growth. Furthermore, the development of a willow-selected mycorrhizal fungal inoculum led to increased willow shoot biomass and total leaf area compared to treatment with the commercial inoculum. Molecular analysis revealed a change in the relative proportions of the mycorrhizal species, with increased abundances of the disturbance-tolerant species Glomus mosseae and G. intraradices in the willowselected inoculum relative to the original commercial inoculum. Overall, despite some modifications and improvements to system efficiency, the achievement of true zero-discharge operation, combined with practical operation, remains difficult in the Irish setting...|$|E
40|$|A 7. 1 ha {{agroforestry}} {{field experiment}} located in south-western Germany demonstrates, how to combine short rotation coppicing for fuel wood production with poultry {{keeping with the}} production of eggs. This combined system offers additional ecosystem services and gives multifarious benefits. The agroforestry system has been established since 2009 by an organic farmer (certified) in close cooperation with the University of Applied Forest Sciences Rottenburg. While changing from indoor to outdoor housing required {{by the standards of}} organic farming the owner of the farmland wanted to meet not only with the standards, but additionally he wanted to fulfill objectives like: * Raising and keeping hens in a close-to–nature environment, * Finding a way, that hens exploit all the terrain available and not only those areas close to the chicken-coop, * Improving the conditions of the vegetation, soil and hygiene of the hens. The agroforestry system has been implemented based on two components: The first component consists of the construction of mobile chicken-coops (patent of the farmer). The mobile coops can be moved in their position over the experimental plots several times per year without much effort. The second component consists of strips of willows and poplars, which are managed by short rotation coppicing. Trees are harvested every 4 to 7 years and will be marketed as woodchips for energy production. The rootstocks will sprout again after harvesting. The trees offer several additional services in the agroforestry system: * Protection of the hens against hawks, sun and wind (animal health and survival) * Production of renewable resources (renewable energy) * Absorption of nitrogen from the excrements (nutrient cycling in the ecosystem) * Field integration into the country side (aesthetics and landscape planning) The whole experimental field was subdivided into 18 tracts of 0. 4 ha. Strips of willow and poplar trees have been established along the tracts. Between the tree strips there is enough space for moving the mobile chicken-coops. Every chicken-coop offers space for 1000 – 1200 hens. In total six coops are installed on the experimental field. The establishment of the trees and the selection of appropriate tree species and provenances have been difficult due to challenging site conditions and standards of organic farming: shallow soil depths, a high clay content and the prohibition of herbicides. Different techniques of non-herbicide-establishment of the short rotation <b>coppicing</b> <b>system</b> have been tested during the last years. For instance the use of mulch foil has emerged as the essential factor for a successful establishment and reduced mortality of trees under such difficult soil conditions. Willows and poplars helped quickly to create a structured field already after two years setting up the agroforestry experiment. In addition the hens indeed use the whole area for grazing and pawing. However the main aim of the adding trees to poultry keeping for egg production is not raising the financial yield with the fuel wood production, but the keeping of the hens in a close-to-nature environment...|$|E

On the contrary, the species assemblage of the forests historically grazed by sheep and that experienced <b>coppice</b> selective <b>system</b> or both coppice-with-standards and timber forestry treatment reflected a lower disturbance context. Finally, the forest historically grazed by both cattle and sheep and treated as coppice-with-standard revealed an intermediate level of disturbances. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

5000|$|Many {{species of}} fruit, e.g., fig, filbert, olive, and pomegranate, are {{commonly}} grown {{on their own}} roots, as {{there may be no}} great advantages to using a special rootstock, or suitable rootstocks may not be readily available. However, even for fruit trees that usually are grown grafted on a rootstock, there can be advantages in growing them on their own roots instead, particularly in the traditional <b>coppicing</b> <b>systems</b> advocated in both sustainable agriculture and permaculture. Disadvantages of using own-root trees can include excessive size and excessive production of wood (thus very long times until the start of fruit production), although training branches horizontally and limiting pruning to summer only may help encourage fruit production at an earlier age. There is a lack of research {{on the use of the}} own root method in large-scale systems. British horticulturalist Hugh Ermen was a prominent advocate of own root fruit trees, particularly Apple trees, following his work at the Brogdale research centre in Kent. [...] The research undertaken at Brogdale did not continue but there has been renewed academic interest in own root fruit trees since the turn of the century.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} harvest on European forest net {{ecosystem}} exchange (NEE) of carbon and its photosynthetic and respiratory components (GPP (gross primary production) and TER (total ecosystem respiration)) were examined by comparing four pairs of mature/harvested sites in Europe via {{a combination of}} eddy covariance measurements and empirical modeling. Three of the comparisons represented high coniferous forestry (spruce in Britain, and pines in Finland and France), while a coppice-with-standard oak plantation was examined in Italy. While every comparison revealed that harvesting converted a mature forest carbon sink into a carbon source of similar magnitude, the mechanisms by which this occurred were very different according to species or management practice. In Britain, Finland, and France the annual sink (source) strength for mature (clear-cut) stands was estimated at 496 (112), 138 (239), and 222 (225) g C m− 2, respectively, with 381 (427) g C m− 2 for the mature (coppiced) stand in Italy. In all three cases of high forestry in Britain, Finland, and France, clear-cutting crippled the photosynthetic capacity of the ecosystem – with mature (clear-cut) GPP of 1970 (988), 1010 (363), and 1600 (602) g C m− 2 – and also reduced ecosystem respiration {{to a lesser degree}} – TER of 1385 (1100), 839 (603), and 1415 (878) g C m− 2, respectively. By contrast, harvesting of the <b>coppice</b> oak <b>system</b> provoked a burst in respiration – with mature (clear-cut) TER estimated at 1160 (2220) gC m− 2 – which endured for the 3 years sampled postharvest. The harvest disturbance also reduced GPP in the <b>coppice</b> <b>system</b> – with mature (clear-cut) GPP of 1600 (1420) g C m− 2 – but to a lesser extent than in the coniferous forests, and with near-complete recovery within a few years. Understanding the effects of harvest on the carbon balance of European forest systems is a necessary step towards characterizing carbon exchange for timberlands on large scales...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Ash-sycamore {{secondary}} forest {{is an important}} forest type that it is increasingly spreading in northern Italy. Nowadays, these forests are not managed with high forest system as they are left in natural evolution and subsequently managed with <b>coppice</b> <b>system</b> without improvement in timber quality. Remarkable potentiality and strong dynamism of these new spontaneous forests, able to colonize in short time fertile lands once used by agricultural activities, have been underlined in many sites. Research activities have shown interesting results in terms of high quality timber production by applying the target tree system. This management approach permits to improve the timber quality concentrating forest practices and production on a restricted number of trees (70 - 150 per hectare). This practice allows a considerable cost reduction and a good growth improvement. First thinning has to be realized at about 15 - 20 years when the dominant trees have average dbh of 9 - 12 cm, height of 12 – 16 m., and crowns deep enough and able to react to thinning and to maintain diameter growth about 1 cm. Remarkable socio-economic difficulties, land propriety fragmentation, lack of tradition and knowledge in high stand broadleaved forest management, hamper strongly the application of this method. In {{order to make the}} best use of Ash-sycamore {{secondary forest}} is therefore necessary to undertake actions focused on land properties association, forest owners training and financial support...|$|R
40|$|In European {{mountain}} regions, forests play {{an important}} role in the mitigation of risk due to natural hazards such as landslides, rockfalls, floods and avalanches. Conifer species usually provide a protective effect at higher altitude, while at lower altitudes broadleaf species are dominant. These forests are or were often managed as <b>coppice</b> <b>systems.</b> The high stem density of coppice stands, their rapid growth and the permanence of root systems in the soil can be considered as assets in terms of protective function. However, these considerations are poorly researched and there is generally a lack of studies investigating the suitability of coppice as protection forests. The issue is relevant, considering that many coppice stands in mountain regions have become uneconomic and are now abandoned and overaged. Whether and how to manage these forests stands is a key question for practitioners. In this contribution we analyze the implications of coppice management for slope stability and in particular to mitigate shallow landslides, focusing on root reinforcement, the main mechanism by which vegetation can reinforce slopes. We review available studies concerning root distribution and dynamics in coppice stands to formulate hypotheses about their contribution in terms of root reinforcement. Finally we highlight the lacks of knowledge and the further steps needed to properly evaluate the effectiveness of the coppices in protecting against shallow landslides...|$|R
40|$|Aspen {{management}} in the Intermountain West has conventionally relied {{on its ability to}} vegetatively reproduce, and has long been used to guide silviculture (e. g., <b>coppice</b> <b>systems).</b> Aspen is prolific in its sprouting response to overstory removal, capable of producing thousands of shoots per hectare. The successful reproduction of aspen is of considerable {{management in}}terest. Without intervention, current threats to the persistence of aspen communities may lead to the continued decline of aspen in the Intermountain West. Successful regeneration is defined as the timely recruitment of a new cohort of aspen stems such that they are no longer susceptible to herbivory or other detrimental factors associated with juvenility. In the broader context of aspen ecology, we can postulate three important drivers of successful aspen regeneration: (1) stand vigor, (2) disturbance history (e. g., management actions), and (3) climatic conditions. A multitude of interactions between these drivers likely ultimately determines the timing, quantity, and quality of aspen regeneration. We measured sites with known management histories on Cedar Mountain and southwestern Utah in order to quantify the success of regeneration based on a comparison of unique pre-treatment versus post-treatment stand conditions. By simultaneously exploring a multitude of factors that possibly affect aspen regeneration, this research: (1) sampled across multiple stand conditions (N= 103), elucidating a diversity of regeneration drivers; (2) identified multiple management scenarios for successful aspen regeneration; and (3) incorporated state-of-the-art knowledge regarding aspen regeneration ecology into a management guide...|$|R

Even more, elevated [CO 2] will increase the net energy production and greenhouse gas balance of a SRC system with 18 %.

30|$|Species and hybrids of {{the genus}} Populus (poplar) are {{important}} examples of trees used in erosion control and remediation programmes in many {{regions of the world}} (Wu et al. 1994; Lammeranner et al. 2005; Licht and Isebrands 2005; Reisner et al. 2007; Blanco and Lal 2008). The advantages of using poplar for erosion control include rapid growth, high evapotranspiration rates, extensive lateral root systems, abundant fine root production, and rapid tree establishment from vegetative material. There continue to be many above-ground attributes of poplars assessed, including in Europe (Pulkkinen et al. 2013; Toillon et al. 2013; Verlinden et al. 2013), China (Fang et al. 2013), and North America (Hart et al. 2013; Kaczmarek et al. 2013), mainly with respect to the rapidly developing use of short-rotation <b>coppice</b> <b>systems</b> for biofuels and other products. In contrast, fewer below-ground investigations have been conducted recently (Benomar et al. 2013; Berhongaray et al. 2013; Hajek et al. 2014; Phillips et al. 2014), and this imbalance needs addressing because root characteristics and their spatial and temporal changes are particularly important in determining efficacy for soil stabilisation (Stokes et al. 2009). Furthermore, in view of the many natural and bred poplar genotypes available (Eckenwalder 1996), variation in root characteristics between species/hybrids of poplar in the field has received scant attention (Al Afas et al. 2008; Benomar et al. 2013; Berhongaray et al. 2013; Phillips et al. 2014). Consequently, there is limited knowledge of the genetic variation in root attributes of populations of poplar which hinders identifying the most appropriate clones for stabilising soil.|$|R
