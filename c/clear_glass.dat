5|$|The {{library is}} a modern looking {{rectangular}} structure with orange brick and <b>clear</b> <b>glass</b> which is adjacent to Glenn Jackson Plaza and Hudson's Bay, with the Mill Race flowing by on the north side. The north and south faces are <b>clear</b> <b>glass,</b> while the other two sides are brick. The exterior walls taper slightly outward on the brick sides of the building. Bricks on these sides were laid horizontally, while the overhanging roof line contains bricks that were laid vertically. A glass-enclosed stairwell and the main entrance near the northwest corner are the only parts that jut out from the primarily rectangular building.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, {{the main}} floor will feature {{transparent}} cornered project fascades and <b>clear</b> <b>glass</b> street level views. The multiple structures will feature approximately 400,000square feet(40,000m²) of retail, entertainment and dining space; 200,000 to 450,000square feet(42,000m²) of office space; a 354-room hotel; a 200- to 300-unit residential tower; and a state-of-the-art CTA transit station providing service to and from Chicago’s O’Hare and Midway airports.|$|E

5|$|Glittery {{bands of}} mica {{decorated}} some balls {{while others were}} silk screened with seasonal motifs such as snowy scenes, sleigh rides, carolers, and poinsettias. Some balls featured silvery indents on their surfaces that reflected the surrounding light. In the early 1950s, <b>clear</b> <b>glass</b> balls appeared decorated with bands of color or glittering sparkles. Molded plastic Santa Clauses, angels, snowmen, and other holiday icons were inexpensive, mass-produced, and readily available.|$|E
5|$|Little of {{the early}} stained glass remains. In the west window of St John's Chapel, for instance, the medieval glass barely survived the {{destruction}} (said to {{have been caused by}} Oliver Cromwell's men). Most of the higher portions went untouched, but others were severely damaged. In some cases the windows were impossible to repair, and <b>clear</b> <b>glass</b> was eventually introduced to replace the missing scenes. The Victorian stained-glass windows were created by some of the finest studios of that period.|$|E
5|$|Among Gaudí's {{largest and}} most {{striking}} works is the Casa Batlló (1904–1906). Commissioned by Josep Batlló i Casanovas to renovate an existing building erected in 1875 by Emili Sala Cortés, Gaudí focused on the façade, the main floor, the patio and the roof, and built a fifth floor for the staff. For this project he was assisted by his aides Domènec Sugrañes, Joan Rubió and Josep Canaleta. The facade is of Montjuïc sandstone cut to create warped ruled surfaces; the columns are bone-shaped with vegetable decoration. Gaudí kept the rectangular shape of the old building's balconies—with iron railings {{in the shape of}} masks—giving the rest of the facade an ascending undulating form. He also faced the facade with ceramic fragments of various colours ("trencadís"), which Gaudí obtained from the waste material of the Pelegrí glass works. The interior courtyard is roofed by a skylight supported by an iron structure {{in the shape of a}} double T, which rests on a series of catenary aches. The helicoidal chimneys are a notable feature of the roof, topped with conical caps, covered in <b>clear</b> <b>glass</b> in the centre and ceramics at the top, and surmounted by <b>clear</b> <b>glass</b> balls filled with sand of different colours. The facade culminates in catenary vaults covered with two layers of brick and faced with glazed ceramic tiles in the form of scales (in shades of yellow, green and blue), which resemble a dragon's back; on the left side is a cylindrical turret with anagrams of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and with Gaudí's four-armed cross.|$|E

25|$|From {{approximately}} 1400 AD, in {{an effort}} to compete with the quality of Venetian glass, it was found that calcium oxide (CaO) added as flux to the sand-potash mix in the form of shells, limestone, or marble gave a <b>clearer</b> <b>glass,</b> by virtue of reducing the amount of potash required along with its attendant colorants.|$|R
5|$|Another {{close friend}} of SpongeBob is Sandy Cheeks, a {{squirrel}} from Texas. She is a scientist and an expert in karate. She lives in an oak tree entrapped in a <b>clear</b> <b>glass</b> dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal. When outside of her dwelling, she wears an astronaut-like suit because she cannot breathe underwater. Mr. Krabs, a miserly crab obsessed with money, {{is the owner of}} the Krusty Krab restaurant and SpongeBob's boss. Krabs has a teenage whale daughter named Pearl, whom he values equally with his riches. His rival, Plankton, is a small green copepod who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called the Chum Bucket, located {{across the street from the}} Krusty Krab. Plankton spends most of his time planning to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers, so as to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business. The majority of Plankton's plans come from his intelligent yet sarcastic computer wife Karen, who is more competent and less conceited than him. When SpongeBob is not working at the Krusty Krab, he can often be found at Mrs. Puff's boating school (the underwater equivalent of a driver's education course). SpongeBob is perpetually unable to pass Mrs. Puff's exams, which is why he almost always walks around town.|$|E

50|$|Franklin's glass armonica {{design was}} {{reworked}} yet again without patent credit by master glassblower and musician, Gerhard B. Finkenbeiner (1930-1999) in 1984. After {{thirty years of}} experimentation, Finkenbeiner's imitative prototype consisted of <b>clear</b> <b>glasses</b> and glasses later equipped with gold bands mimicking late 18th-century designs. The historical instruments with gold bands indicated {{the equivalent of the}} black keys on the piano, simplifying the multi-hued painted bowl rims with white accidentals as specified by Franklin. Finkenbeiner Inc., of Waltham, Massachusetts, continues to produce versions of these instruments commercially , featuring glass elements made of scientific formulated fused-silica quartz.|$|R

25|$|Photosensitive {{glass is}} a <b>clear</b> <b>glass</b> in which {{microscopic}} metallic particles can be formed into a picture or image {{by exposure to}} short wave radiations such as ultraviolet light. Photosensitive glass was invented in November 1937 by S. Donald Stookey of Corning Glass Works.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{available}} for use in injectable form (IV) in Europe, {{but not in the}} U.S. The injection pack is a combination pack consisting of a vial and a separate ampule of reconstituting solution. Each 10-ml <b>clear</b> <b>glass</b> vial contains a white to off-white lyophilised powder consisting of omeprazole sodium 42.6mg, equivalent to 40mg of omeprazole.|$|E

40|$|The He, Ne, and. Ar {{contents}} of nineteen Apollo- 11 glasses and four Apollo- 12 glasses were measured massspectrometrically. The glasses were variously colored particles: amber, clear, green, and brown, and were approximately 500 microns in size. We {{have found that}} these glassy fragments contain much smaller quantities of trapped gas (solar wind) than lithic fragments the same size. The color of the glass particles is indicative of their chemical composition. The elemental and isotopic ratios {{are similar to those}} for lunar bulk soil. It has been shown that the amber and green glasses, and possibly the brown glasses, contain a cosmogenic component of Ne 21 which can be attributed to solar cosmic ray interactions with Mg 24 and probably with Al 27. Similarly, the <b>clear</b> <b>glasses</b> contain a cosmogenic component of Ar 38 which can be attributed to solar cosmic ray interactions with Ca 40. The Ne 21 radiation ages of three green glasses and one amber glass are older than the average Ne 21 radiation age for bulk soil. Three <b>clear</b> <b>glasses</b> show an 38 radiation age older than the average Ar 38 radiation age for the bulk soil...|$|R

Software converts the two images to an integrated anaglyph 3D image, for viewing with plastic red/cyan glasses, or to the cross converged process for <b>clear</b> <b>glasses</b> and somewhat better color accuracy. The results are viewable by a group wearing the glasses. More typically, a camera attached {{to one of the}} eyepieces will record conventional 2D images.|$|R

25|$|In some cases, {{the cost}} of {{recyclable}} materials also exceeds {{the cost of}} raw materials. Virgin plastic resin costs 40 percent less than recycled resin. Additionally, a United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study that tracked the price of <b>clear</b> <b>glass</b> from 15 July – 2 August 1991, found that the average cost per ton ranged from $40 to $60 while a USGS report shows that the cost per ton of raw silica sand from years 1993 to 1997 fell between $17.33 and $18.10.|$|E
