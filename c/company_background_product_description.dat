40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} the {{application}} of function oriented <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> in <b>product</b> development is outlined and extended towards factory planning. Therefore the information sources for building up a function oriented <b>product</b> <b>description</b> are identified and described. Correspondingly, it is shown how the function oriented <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> may be exploited by subsequent activities such as: defining subsystems {{or in the case}} of factories deriving layouts, processes and selecting equipment. Moreover this work describes how the functional requirements that are contained in such a function oriented <b>product</b> <b>description</b> may be managed and how a performance measurement system can be linked in order to assess the fulfillment of the requirements or to monitor the current state...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{main task}} of product {{developers}} {{is to meet}} the ever increasing demands on quality, cost and functionality of technical products by setting the appropriate characteristics in order to realize the product properties desired by the customer. The overall objective of the authors {{is to develop a}} suitable procedure model for property-based product development, which guides the developers purposefully through the development process. An essential part of this procedure model is the matrix-based <b>product</b> <b>description,</b> which is in the focus of this paper. The matrix-based <b>product</b> <b>description</b> is basically a so-called multi domain matrix. By using this matrix-based <b>product</b> <b>description,</b> dependencies between requirements, behaviors of the product and the product's properties and characteristics can be mapped and analyzed systematically during the product development process. Thereby, for example, the effects of characteristic changes on product properties become visible and traceable and also differential requirements are set into relationship with properties and characteristics of the product. However, {{it has been shown that}} the manual filling of the matrix-based <b>product</b> <b>description</b> is very time-consuming. Hence, a computer-aided support is indispensable. For this reason, the software Loomeo is used in this paper to investigate its potential for IT support for the matrix-based <b>product</b> <b>description.</b> The interaction of dependencies between characteristics, properties and the resulting behavior is demonstrated in this paper through the matrix-based <b>product</b> <b>description</b> using the example of a front wheel suspension of a car. Thus, the strengths and weaknesses as well as opportunities and risks of Loomeo regarding the suitability of the IT-based matrix-based <b>product</b> <b>description</b> can be determined. The findings from both the application as well as from the evaluation of the software are the basis for the improvement and extension of the matrix-based <b>product</b> <b>description...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Future {{manufacturing}} {{systems are}} required to be adaptable and react quickly on changes in markets and demands. Additionally, {{they should be able}} to support individualized products that are tailored to customer needs. Flexibility can be increased through decoupling <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> from manu-facturing systems. Production processes are no longer described based on available resources. Instead, a generic description with all required parameters is defined once and later used with different factory setups. We propose a list of parameters and information that should be included in such a generic <b>product</b> <b>description.</b> Afterwards, we define possible structures for <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> that can typically occur in manufacturing systems.

A case-by-case reviewing of each <b>product</b> <b>description</b> is a laborious and time-consuming task that fails to deliver a condensed view of a product line. This paper introduces MatrixMiner: a tool for automatically synthesizing product comparison matrices (PCMs) from a set of <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> written in natural language. Ma-trixMiner is capable of identifying and organizing features and values in a PCM – despite the informality and absence of structure in the textual <b>descriptions</b> of <b>products.</b> Our empirical results of products mined from BestBuy show that the synthesized PCMs exhibit numerous quantitative, comparable information. Users can exploit MatrixMiner to visualize the matrix through a Web editor and review, refine, or complement the cell values thanks to the traceability with the original <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> and technical specifications...|$|R

Strong biases assumed in many existing systems are weakened {{so that the}} real stores with reasonably complex document structures can be handled.

This method is capable of analyzing <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> that comprise multiple logical lines, and even those with extra or missing attributes. Experimental tests on over 60 sites show that it successfully constructs correct wrappers for most real stores. 1 Introduction A shopping agent is a mediator system that extracts the <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> from several online stores on a user's behalf.

40|$|International audienceIn {{product line}} engineering, domain {{analysis}} {{is the process}} of analyzing related products to identify their common and variable features. This process is generally carried out by experts on the basis of existing <b>product</b> <b>descriptions,</b> which are expressed in a more or less structured way. Modeling and reasoning about <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> are error-prone and time consuming tasks. Feature models (FMs) constitute popular means to specify product commonalities and variabilities in a compact way, and to provide automated support to the domain analysis process. This paper aims at easing the transition from <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> expressed in a tabular format to FMs accurately representing them. This process is parameterized through a dedicated language and high-level directives (e. g., products/features scoping). We guarantee that the resulting FM represents the set of legal feature combinations supported by the considered products and has a readable tree hierarchy together with variability information. We report on our experiments based on public data and characterize the properties of the derived FMs...|$|R
