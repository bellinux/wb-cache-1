This article presents a systematic study of the role played by the changes in the translation and rotation of the Earth in spacecraft launching. Neglecting these changes, which inevitably arise in the interaction between the Earth and the spacecraft, there is an obvious conflict with the conservation laws of momentum and angular momentum. Nevertheless, this flaw in principle is not accompanied by any technically erroneous answers when college students solve the often-encountered exercise problems, thanks to the special reference frames students use. It is pointed out that the technical validity of the Earth-in-constant-motion approximation cannot be generalized to arbitrary reference frames. For example, the correct values of the second and third <b>cosmic</b> <b>velocities</b> cannot be found in an arbitrary reference frame if the velocity of the Earth is treated as a constant. In an arbitrary reference frame, the increase in the translational kinetic energy of the Earth, which is caused by the work done by the gravitational pull by the spacecraft, is not negligible if compared with the increase in the kinetic energy of the spacecraft. It is also demonstrated that the disparity in the energy consumed in launching a spacecraft from the ground along different directions cannot be well interpreted if the angular velocity of the Earth is treated as a constant. When the spacecraft is launched eastwards, the increase in its kinetic energy is partly gained, either directly or indirectly, at the expense of a decrease in the rotational kinetic energy of the Earth...|$|R

As a result, CvB observatories may measure anisotropies in the <b>cosmic</b> neutrino <b>velocity</b> and spin distributions by polarizing the tritium targets. A small dipole anisotropy in the CvB is expected due to the peculiar velocity of the lab frame with respect to the cosmic frame and due to late-time gravitational effects.

40|$|In their {{approach}} to Earth dynamics the authors consider the fundamentals of Jacobi Dynamics (1987, Reidel) for two reasons. First, because satellite observations have proved that the Earth does not stay in hydrostatic equilibrium, which is the physical basis of today’s treatment of geodynamics. And secondly, because satellite data have revealed a relationship between gravitational moments and {{the potential of the}} Earth’s outer force field (potential energy), which is the basis of Jacobi Dynamics. This has also enabled the authors {{to come back to the}} derivation of the classical virial theorem and, after introducing the volumetric forces and moments, to obtain a generalized virial theorem in the form of Jacobi’s equation. Thus a physical explanation and rigorous solution was found for the famous Jacobi’s equation, where the measure of the matter interaction is the energy. The main dynamical effects which become understandable by that solution can be summarized as follows: • the kinetic energy of oscillation of the interacting particles which explains the physical meaning and nature of the gravitation forces; • separation of the shell’s rotation of a self-gravitating body with respect to the mass density; difference in angular velocities of the shell rotation; • continuity in changing the potential of the outer gravitational force field together with changes in density distribution of the interacting masses (volumetric center of masses); • the nature of the precession of the Earth, the Moon and satellites; the nature of the rotating body’s magnetic field and the generation of the planet’s electromagnetic field. As a final result, the creation of the bodies in the Solar System having different orbits was discussed. This result is based on the discovery that all the averaged orbital velocities of the bodies in the Solar System and the Sun itself are equal to the first <b>cosmic</b> <b>velocities</b> of their proto-parents during the evolution of their redistributed mass density.   Audience The work is a logical continuation of the book Jacobi Dynamics and is intended for researchers, teachers and students engaged in theoretical and experimental research in various branches of astronomy (astrophysics, celestial mechanics and stellar dynamics and radiophysics), geophysics (physics and dynamics of the Earth’s body, atmosphere and oceans), planetology and cosmogony, and for students of celestial, statistical, quantum and relativistic mechanics and hydrodynamics...|$|R

I find {{there is a second}} universe, {{resulting}} in “new physics ” that finally explains how gravity, EM waves and permittivity operate in a vacuum. It is an excerpt of Chapters 8 and 20 of the volume “Dual Space”[1]. Some principles of Dual Space are: 1. There is a larger Euclidean universe (“Espace”) that includes time as its 4 th dimension. 2. Our 3 -dimensional universe was extracted from Espace and does not “join ” with time. 3. Our universe moves at <b>cosmic</b> <b>velocity</b> c in the 4 th dimension (ergo, ‘time passes’). 4. Gravity reduces cosmic speed, clock speed and the velocity of light. 5. Time is absolute. This extract is intended for anyone seeking an alternative to relativity’s gravity. Dual Space readily explains the GPS corrections, gravitational redshift, failure of Michelson Morley, and is so far, the only solution to the Pioneer 10 anomaly. The gravity equation of Dual Space is Newton’s equation with two terms added that define the slowing of both light and <b>cosmic</b> <b>velocity,</b> reminiscent of time dilation. A simple time-arrow velocity diagram vividly demonstrates these effects. Our model is Euclidean, and <b>cosmic</b> <b>velocity</b> agrees with our notion of time passing.

40|$|Cosmological {{analysis}} {{based on}} currently available observations {{are unable to}} rule out a sizeable coupling among the dark energy and dark matter fluids. We explore a variety of coupled dark matter-dark energy models, which satisfy cosmic microwave background constraints, in light of low redshift and near universe observations. We illustrate the phenomenology of different classes of dark coupling models, paying particular attention in distinguishing between effects that appear only on the expansion history and those that appear {{in the growth of}} structure. We find that while a broad class of dark coupling models are effectively models where general relativity (GR) is modified - and thus can be probed by a combination of tests for the expansion history and the growth of structure -, there is a class of dark coupling models where gravity is still GR, but the growth of perturbations is, in principle modified. While this effect is small in the specific models we have considered, one should bear in mind that an inconsistency between reconstructed expansion history and growth may not uniquely indicate deviations from GR. Our low redshift constraints arise from <b>cosmic</b> <b>velocities,</b> redshift space distortions and dark matter abundance in galaxy voids. We find that current data constrain the dimensionless coupling to be vertical bar xi vertical bar < 0. 2, but prospects from forthcoming data are for a significant improvement. Future, precise measurements of the Hubble constant, combined with high-precision constraints on the growth of structure, could provide the key to rule out dark coupling models which survive other tests.

They study the propagation of cosmic rays in the different phases of the I. S.
