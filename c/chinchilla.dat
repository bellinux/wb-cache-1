5|$|A {{greenway}} and/or connecting trail along Leggetts Creek {{was proposed}} in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan in the early 2000s. The greenway would {{be known as the}} Leggetts Creek greenway. It could link to the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail and could be extended to link to the Tunkhannock greenway. The South Abington Park and the Leggetts Creek Trail are in <b>Chinchilla</b> and the creek flows though the latter. Trestle Hole Park is also along the creek's lower reaches. The Dutch Gap Little League Field is located at Wells Street.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a <b>chinchilla</b> and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa {{mentions}} he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E
5|$|Four {{species have}} been {{recovered}} from Pleistocene cave deposits from Mount Etna Caves National Park near Rockhampton in central Queensland. Remains of the tiger quoll and the northern quoll, and a species either identical or {{very similar to the}} eastern quoll, as well as a prehistoric species as yet undescribed, all lived in what was a rainforest climate. The northern quoll is still found in the region. The fossil species D. dunmalli, described by Bartholomai in 1971, is the oldest species recovered to date. Its remains were found in Pliocene deposits near <b>Chinchilla</b> in southeastern Queensland. Known only from a lower jaw and some teeth, it was a relative of the tiger quoll.|$|E
50|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{infections are}} widely {{distributed}} {{in nature and}} can affect <b>chinchillas</b> like many other animals. They can cause wide deaths in populations of <b>chinchillas</b> and spontaneous abortion in pregnant <b>chinchillas.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Chinchillas</b> {{are easily}} distressed {{and when they}} are unhappy they may have {{physical}} symptoms. In protecting their health, care should be taken not to disturb them, and lots of things disturb them. Humans who monitor the <b>chinchillas</b> can often have intuitive ideas about recent changes which might be disturbing <b>chinchillas</b> who exhibit new symptoms, as <b>chinchillas</b> are sensitive enough to physically react when something new is bothering them. It is not appropriate to suddenly change a <b>chinchilla's</b> regular diet, especially when they are sick, as this upsets them. Sick <b>chinchillas</b> may quit eating if they are stressed, which can make them even more weak.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chinchillas</b> {{have been}} used in {{research}} since the 1950s. Since the 1970s, the prime interest in <b>chinchillas</b> by researchers is their auditory system. Other research fields in which <b>chinchillas</b> are used as an animal model include the study of Chagas disease, gastrointestinal diseases, pneumonia, and listeriosis, as well as of Yersinia and Pseudomonas infections.|$|R
5|$|L. ahuacaense was {{the fourth}} species of the genus Lagidium to be described, after L.peruanum, L.viscacia, and L.wolffsohni of the central and {{southern}} Andes, although more species may eventually be recognized within L.peruanum and L.viscacia, and L.wolffsohni is poorly differentiated from L.viscacia. Together with the plains viscacha (Lagostomus maximus) and the chinchillas (<b>Chinchilla),</b> Lagidium forms the rodent family Chinchillidae. Within Lagidium, L.ahuacaense differs by at least 7.9% from all other species in DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. A cladistic analysis placed the Ecuadorian species as the sister group to all other Lagidium species, but support for this placement was not strong. Morphometric analysis also confirmed the Ecuadorian population is different from other Lagidium species.|$|E
5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot {{is found}} {{in the foothills of the}} Great Dividing Range and surrounding areas. The northern limit of its range is 26° south in southeastern Queensland, around Cooloola, Blackbutt and <b>Chinchilla,</b> extending westwards to the vicinity of St George. Before 1945, it had been recorded as far north as the Suttor River and Mackay. In New South Wales, it {{is found in}} a broad band across the central and eastern parts of the state, with its western limits delineated by Moree, Quambone, Hillston, Narrandera and Deniliquin. There have been unconfirmed sightings in the far west of the state. In Victoria it {{is found in the}} vicinity of Wangaratta as well as East Gippsland and around Mallacoota. Sightings in South Australia are likely to have been the scarlet-chested parrot, the similar appearance of the females leading to confusion and misidentification.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Leggetts Creek sometimes exceeds its total maximum daily load, especially during low flow conditions and the summer months. There are some mine drainage issues on the creek between Rockwell Avenue and Charles Street. It experiences some flow loss to underground mine voids. In 1978, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (now known as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection) estimated that the creek lost 20 to 30 percent of its flow to mines during dry weather. However, the creek is large enough that this does not cause aquatic habitat to be lost. The <b>Chinchilla</b> sewage treatment plant discharges into the creek {{in the vicinity of}} Leggetts Gap. In its lower reaches, the creek is impacted by past mining, urban development, and debris. Stormwater also flows into the Lackawanna River via the creek and it is affected by fine sediment. There is one stormwater detention facility in the watershed, at Leggett's Creek Estates.|$|E
50|$|Las <b>Chinchillas</b> National Reserve is {{a nature}} reserve {{located in the}} Choapa Province, Coquimbo Region, Chile. The reserve gives shelter to the last colonies of Long-tailed <b>Chinchillas</b> in the wild.|$|R
50|$|In {{their native}} habitats, <b>chinchillas</b> live in burrows or crevices in rocks. They are agile jumpers and can jump up to 6 ft. Predators {{in the wild}} include birds of prey, skunks, felines, snakes and canines. <b>Chinchillas</b> {{have a variety of}} {{defensive}} tactics, including spraying urine and releasing fur if bitten. In the wild, <b>chinchillas</b> have been observed eating plant leaves, fruits, seeds, and small insects.|$|R
5000|$|Because of the {{impending}} extinction of short-tailed <b>chinchillas,</b> conservation measures were implemented in the 1890s in Chile. However, these measures were unregulated. The 1910 treaty between Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, and Peru brought the first international efforts to ban hunting and commercialization of <b>chinchillas.</b> Unfortunately, this effort led to great price increases, thus led to the further decline of the remaining populations. The first successful protection law passed in Chile was not until 1929. Today, both the short-tailed and long-tailed <b>chinchillas</b> are listed as “endangered” both in Chile and by the IUCN. [...] Because of successful reproduction in captive environments, <b>chinchillas</b> are less hunted in the wild.|$|R

40|$|Behavioral {{responses}} {{obtained from}} <b>chinchillas</b> trained to discriminate a cosine-phase harmonic tone complex from wideband noise {{indicate that the}} perception of ‘pitch’ strength in <b>chinchillas</b> is largely influenced by periodicity information in the stimulus envelope. The perception of ‘pitch’ strength was examined in <b>chinchillas</b> in a stimulus generalization paradigm after animals had been retrained to discriminate infinitely iterated rippled noise from wideband noise. Retrained <b>chinchillas</b> gave larger behavioral responses to test stimuli having strong fine structure periodicity, but weak envelope periodicity. That is, <b>chinchillas</b> learn to use {{the information in the}} fine structure and consequently, their perception of ‘pitch’ strength is altered. Behavioral responses to rippled noises having similar periodicity strengths, but large spectral differences were also tested. Responses to these rippled noises were similar, suggesting a temporal analysis can be used to account for the behavior. Animals were then retested using the cosine-phase harmonic tone complex as the expected signal stimulus. Generalization gradients returned to those obtained originally in the naïve condition, suggesting that <b>chinchillas</b> do not remain “fine structure listeners,” but rather revert back to being “envelope listeners” when the periodicity strength in the envelope of the expected stimulus is high...|$|R
40|$|Otitis media {{developed}} in 67 % of <b>chinchillas</b> inoculated intranasally with type 7 Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza A virus. Only 4 % of <b>chinchillas</b> inoculated with influenza alone and 21 % of <b>chinchillas</b> inoculated with S. pneumoniae alone developed otitis media. Among the <b>chinchillas</b> that developed otitis media after inoculation with both pneumococcus and influenza, 73 % {{of the affected}} ears contained effusion, and 27 % of the affected ears showed tympanic membrane inflammation without middle ear effusion obtained on paracentesis. Although {{a majority of the}} ears with effusion yielded S. pneumoniae on culture, one-third of the effusions were sterile for aerobic bacteria. This model resembles conditions accompanying otitis media in humans and suggests that respiratory viral infection contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of acute otitis media...|$|R

25|$|PETA sends {{its staff}} {{undercover}} into research laboratories, factory farms, and circuses {{to document the}} treatment of animals. Investigators may spend many months as employees of a facility, making copies of documents and wearing hidden cameras. By 2007, it had conducted 75 such investigations. It has also produced videos based on material collected during ALF raids. Some undercover efforts have led to lawsuits or government action against companies and universities. PETA itself faced legal action in April 2007 after the owners of a <b>chinchilla</b> ranch in Michigan complained about an undercover inquiry there, but the judge ruled in PETA's favor that undercover investigations can be legitimate.|$|E
5000|$|Many <b>chinchillas</b> are bred {{in captivity}} for their fur, {{which is very}} fine and dense, and is in high demand in the fur industry. Commercial hunting began in 1829 and {{increased}} every year, by about half a million skins annually, as fur and skin demand increased in the United States and Europe. “The continuous and intense harvesting rate, however, was not sustainable {{and the number of}} <b>chinchillas</b> hunted declined until the resource was considered economically extinct by 1917". [...] Hunting <b>chinchillas</b> became illegal in 1929, but laws were not effectively enforced until 1983.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Chinchillas</b> {{project is}} a silver-lead-zinc deposit, located in the Puna region of northwestern Argentina, in Jujuy Province. <b>Chinchillas</b> is {{approximately}} 42 kilometers by road from the Pirquitas property. The 2017 pre-feasibility study on the <b>Chinchillas</b> project evaluates the development and construction of an open-pit mine and supporting infrastructure, which will supply ore to the Pirquitas processing facilities over an eight-year active mining period. <b>Chinchillas</b> will be mined by conventional drill, blast, truck, and loading open pit mining methods. A fleet of 35-tonne road haul trucks will transport ore approximately 42 kilometers to the Pirquitas processing facilities. Over the life of mine, the Pirquitas processing facility is expected to produce a silver-lead concentrate and a zinc concentrate. The two concentrates will be shipped internationally to smelters for processing.|$|R
