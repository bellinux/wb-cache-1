25|$|Brazing is the {{preferred}} method for joining pipe and tube copper alloys. Copper metal sections are joined with a non-ferrous filler material with a melting point above 800 degrees Fahrenheit but below the melting point of the base metals. Blind or <b>concealed</b> <b>joints</b> are recommended since the color match of silver filler material is fair to poor.|$|R
50|$|The {{pseudonym}} {{entered into}} use on Doctor Who only after Read had become that show's script editor. Read and producer Graham Williams used the pen name hurriedly to assemble The Invasion of Time in 1978. A year later the name <b>concealed</b> the <b>joint</b> work of Douglas Adams, Williams and David Fisher on City of Death.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{foundation}} {{can trace}} its roots to Carl Baudin of the Leipziger Stadt theatre in Germany. He is {{the inventor of}} greasepaint. He wanted to <b>conceal</b> the <b>joint</b> between his wig and forehead, so he developed a flesh-coloured paste made of zinc, ochre and lard. This formulation was so popular with other actors that Baudin began producing it commercially, and, as such, {{gave birth to the}} first theatrical makeup.|$|R
50|$|Some rock {{gardens are}} {{designed}} and built to look like natural outcrops of bedrock. Stones are aligned to suggest a bedding plane, and plants are often used to <b>conceal</b> the <b>joints</b> between said stones. This type of rockery was popular in Victorian times and usually created by professional landscape architects. The same approach is sometimes used in commercial or modern-campus landscaping but can also be applied in smaller private gardens.|$|R
50|$|A strong joint, {{the tongue}} and groove joint is widely used for {{re-entrant}} angles. The effect of wood shrinkage is <b>concealed</b> when the <b>joint</b> is beaded or otherwise moulded. In expensive cabinet work, glued dovetail and multiple {{tongue and groove}} are used.|$|R
50|$|This type {{of joint}} {{can be made}} with a V-shaped jointer or a trowel soon after the bricks are laid. Ornamental and highly visible, the <b>joint</b> <b>conceals</b> small {{irregularities}} and is highly attractive. Like the concave joint, the V-joint is water-resistant because its formation compacts the mortar and its shape directs water away from the seal.|$|R

In our proposal, {{the relationship between}} motion vectors and disparity vectors is exploited first. Based on the parallelogram-like motion relationship, the motion vectors of error frames can be indirectly derived by projecting the disparity vectors from the counterpart view. In addition, to further improve the <b>concealing</b> results, a <b>joint</b> sum of the absolute difference (SAD) minimization approach is also proposed to find the block {{for the purpose of}} concealing the current error block by jointly considering motion vectors and disparity vectors. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm provides better video quality than previous work and reduces error propagation.|$|R
40|$|By {{controlling}} {{a robotic}} arm, autistic children can learn the movements associated with social interactions. The goals of my invention are that autistic children would safely {{interact with the}} robotic arm and mimic the robotic arm to replicate movements associated with social interactions. The results from my Peter J. Eloranta Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship suggest that all autistic children successfully learned social movements by mimicking a robotic arm. A more effective robotic arm would better replicate human motion than currently available commercial products. Additionally, a protective sleeve that <b>conceals</b> wiring and <b>joints</b> would make this product safer for young children, the main client of the invention. by Devanie DuFour. Thesis (S. B.)

Rekonstrukcijom građevine godine 1990. obnovljen je prostorni ambijent pa se pristupilo i restauraciji zdenca na izvornu mjestu. Tom su prilikom provedena istraživanja dijelova starokršćanske piscine i svih elemenata romaničkoga zdenca. Autor opisuje njihov izvorni oblik s osvrtom na funkciju dijelova te visoku zanatsku kulturu i tehnička rješenja u postavljanju i međusobnu povezivanju elemenata romaničkoga zdenca. The author {{publishes the}} {{architectural}} sketches {{of the early}} Christian baptistery in Zadar {{on the basis of}} research and the remains. and the original sketches of the baptistery dating from 1916. Furthermore, he considered the early Christian and Romanesque font. The latest research has determined that the basin has two long and two short extensions. The steps were probably in the long one, which was destroyed with the construction of the foundations of the Romanesque font. According to typological characteristics, the early Christian extension may be said to date from the 5 th century, which is when the baptistery was done. The structure of the Romanesque font was placed on the above mentioned foundations reaching {{to the bottom of the}} early Christian baptistery, its height reaching beyond the floor level by the height of the round stylobate. The font consists of two octagonal rings. While the inner one functions as holy water stone basin, the outer one is its decorative screen, made as enclosure. Between these two rings there used to be a four-leaf "shell", that is, a small font basin made for individual baptisms. The font was damaged in World War Il, and the elements of the outer ring were put togather only in 1974 for the Permanent exibition of church art in Zadar. Elements of the inner ring were deposited as archaeological material, while the damaged font foundation, its stylobate and the baptistery floor, remained in situ. The entire font was reconstructed in 1991. A scheme, according to which it was possible to restore the entire baptistery was carved in the foundation. Iron spikes and cooper hooks, stopped by molten lead, were important parts of the structure. Another important technical solution in putting up the structure were <b>concealed</b> <b>joints</b> made of waterproof mortar, which was also used to make the bottom of the stone basin. In the restored interior of the nave stands the Romanesque font, erected in a splendid symbiosis of architectural form and liturgical act, which was established as early as in the 5 th century, when the baptistery with the crossshaped basin, buried in the floor, was built, and then in the 12 th century, when, at the site of the early Christian basin, a new one, in the shape of an octagonal wreath raised on the stylobate of circular steps, was constructed...|$|R
