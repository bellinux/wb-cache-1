40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{analyzed}} {{the recognition of}} local residents surrounding farmland conversion area. The details of the survey on the residents included recognition of farmland conversion, the usage and reason of farmland conversion in the surrounding area, impacts of farmland conversion on the local region and agricultural production, and change in farmland prices. According to the analysis, {{the aging of the}} local residents progressed, and the ratio of farming population was high in the case study area. There were many warehouse facilities and small scale factories in terms of farmland conversion in the case study area, due to the surrounding area characteristics of industrial complex and relatively cheaper land prices. The farmland conversion affected the local area and residents both positively and negatively, and the surrounding area's land prices rose. The policy implications, based on the findings in this study, indicate the following need to be carried out: the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> on farmland pollution upon farmland conversion, review of planned collective conversion mode, and return of the land price hike profits to the affected local area an...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe basal ganglia, and the {{striatum}} in particular, {{are critical}} for action reinforcement [1, 2]. The dorsal striatum, which can be further subdivided into dorsomedial (DMS) and dorsolateral (DLS) striatum, is mainly composed of two subpopulations of striatal medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs) : dopamine D 1 receptor-expressing MSNs that constitute the striatonigral or direct pathway (dMSNs); and dopamine D 2 receptor-expressing MSNs that constitute the striatopallidal or indirect pathway (iMSNs) [3]. It {{has been suggested that}} each pathway has opposing roles in reinforcement, with dMSNs being important to learn positive reinforcement and iMSNs to learn to avoid undesired actions (Go/No-Go) [1]. Furthermore, optogenetic self-stimulation of dMSNs in DMS leads to reinforcement <b>of</b> <b>actions,</b> while self-stimulation <b>of</b> iMSNs leads to avoidance <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> [2]. However, in DLS, which has been implicated in the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> well-trained <b>actions</b> and habits in mice [4, 5], both pathways are active during lever-pressing for reward [6]. Furthermore, extensive skill training leads to long-lasting potentiation of glutamatergic inputs into both dMSNs and iMSNs [4]. We report here that, in DLS, both dMSNs and iMSNs are involved in positive reinforcement, but support different action strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of free market in Poland entails {{a number of}} social and economic reforms, including banking, which is the foundation of economy. In this respect the most important legal acts are the Act on Banking Law and the Act on the National Bank o f Poland, which comprehensively regulate the functioning and supervision of the Polish banking system. Well organised and effectively operated banking supervision guarantees the stability of the whole national banking sector and consequently also the whole economy. The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision is one of the bodies which have raised this point. This influential advisory committee comprising banking supervision organs from several dozens of states has issued „The Fundamental Principles of an Effective Banking Supervision”, a document including 25 „commandments” designating the aims of legal regulations involved. The article present those of them which concern the standards of holding and executing banking supervision by proper organs. The presentation is accompanied by an analysis of the Polish banking law regulations and their conformity with the Basle Committee proposals, in particular: continuous supervision methods, <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> supervisory <b>actions,</b> and the ways o f ensuring that banks execute the supervisory recommendations issued by supervisory organs...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedThis thesis reports two {{contributions}} {{that have been}} prompted by a quest to better understand self-assembly.; Motivated by theoretical investigations of self-assembly, Adleman, Huang, Moisset, Reishus and I have investigated the mathematics of the "law <b>of</b> mass <b>action.</b> " We believe that the law <b>of</b> mass <b>action</b> is <b>of</b> intrinsic mathematical interest, and may have deep connections to research in non-linear differential equations as well as algebraic geometry. One of our goals {{is to make the}} law <b>of</b> mass <b>action</b> available beyond chemistry. This has led us to a dynamical theory of sets of binomials over the complex numbers. A second goal is to present a mathematical <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> mass <b>action</b> chemistry. We have provided precise definitions, elucidated what can now be proved, and indicated what is only conjectured. This aspect of our work addresses the mathematical foundations <b>of</b> mass <b>action</b> chemistry.; My second contribution is to the emerging field of DNA self-assembly. It has been suggested that DNA self-assembly may lead to the manufacture of novel materials and computational devices. Chelyapov, Brun, Reishus, Shaw, Adleman and I have reported DNA complexes in the shape of triangles and in the pattern of hexagonal, planar tilings. Nikhil Gopalkrishnan, Adleman and I have reported DNA complexes in the shape of cylinders and Mobius strips. The prevalent practice in the DNA self-assembly community appears to be to model DNA double helices as rigid cylinders and DNA lattices as rigid sheets. In contrast, our nanostructures were designed to avail of residual flexibilities in DNA double helices and DNA lattices...|$|R

To include the perspectives of young people in the climate change and adaptation debate, we conducted a Photovoice and draw-and-write project with 29 school students in Ethiopia, through which students were given a platform to explore their social representations of the environment. Thematic analysis of our findings suggested that young people have a deep appreciation of the moral, health-related and economic importance of the environment, a commitment to preserving it and a sense of responsibility and agency in relation to contributing to this preservation. Students saw environmental degradation as reversible, through a combination of commitment by themselves, local government and the global community. We conclude by discussing ways our findings might best be taken up in school-level programmes to strengthen youths’ existing social networks for the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> ‘green’ identities, <b>action</b> and activism...|$|R

Nuclear weapons material production {{began in the}} early 1950 s, utilizing five production reactors. In the early 1990 s all SRS production reactor operations were terminated. The first reactor closure end state declaration was recently institutionalized in a Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) Early <b>Action</b> Record <b>of</b> Decision. The decision for the final closure of the 318, 000 square foot 105 -P Reactor was determined to be in situ decommissioning (ISD). ISD is an acceptable and cost effective alternative to off-site disposal for the reactor building, which will allow for <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> remedial <b>action</b> wastes generated from other cleanup activities within the P Area. ISD is considered protective by the regulators, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC), public and stakeholders as waste materials are stabilized/immobilized, and radioactivity is allowed to naturally decay, thus preventing future exposure to the environment. Stakeholder buy-in was critical in the upfront planning in order to achieve this monumental final decision. Numerous public meetings and workshops were held in two different states (covering a 200 mile radius) with stakeholder and SRS Citizens Advisory Board participation. These meetings were conducted over an eight month period as the end state decision making progressed. Information provided to the public evolved from workshop to workshop as data became available and public input from the public meetings were gathered.

Specifically, section 3 of the 1888 clarified that a newspaper proprietor {{could not be found}} liable for a [...] "fair and accurate report" [...] of court proceedings, although whether this amounted to qualified or absolute privilege was not made clear at the time. Section 4, building on the vaguer language of the 1881 Act, gave an enumerated list of cases when the defence of qualified privilege could now be used, including [...] "any meeting of a vestry, town council, school board, board of guardians, board or local authority formed or constituted under the provisions of any Act of Parliament, or of any committee appointed by any of the above-mentioned bodies". An additional requirement placed upon proprietors wishing to claim immunity was that they be responsive to demands for a printed correction or the error in subsequent issues of the newspaper, the definition of which was inherited from the 1881 Act. Exemptions in both sections 3 and 4 existed for blasphemous libel. Section 5 allowed for the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> libel <b>actions</b> involving the same libel against different defendants, saving on legal costs and preventing inconsistency of ruling, whilst section 8 repealed section 3 of the 1881 Act ("No prosecution for newspaper libel without fiat of Attorney General") replacing it with the condition that no [...] "proprietor, publisher, editor or any person responsible for the publication of a newspaper" [...] (not including journalists) be sued (or indeed tried) for libel without the order of a High Court judge.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> {{services}} {{is a widely}} accepted technique for IaaS Cloud providers to reducing energy consumption and improving the utilization of their resources. This technique is based on distributing all services in the minimum amount of servers. This way, the overall energy consumption of the datacenter is reduced, as less servers are needed to be active. Traditionally, {{research has focused on}} strategies for <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> Virtual Machines (VMs), but containers are changing the landscape of Cloud services. Containers are expected to optimize the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> services by reducing the amount of needed resources, thus allocating more services using less servers. However, while multiple research works have been produced in the Energy Efficiency (EE) achieved through <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> VMs, there is yet no experimental work on how <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers affects EE, when assuming a given Quality-of-Service (QoS) to the user.

Consecutively, we analyze how the degradation of the service is produced both in QoS and EE, and we show how QoS is the variable which is more affected by consolidation.

40|$|Introduction: Occupational therapists, {{throughout}} the history, faced {{the need to}} offer actions pertaining to socio-cultural issues in different populations with whom they interact, being required to develop actions relevant to these contexts. In addition, interventions specifically {{within the scope of}} culture have also been understood as the scope of this work. Objective: To report the METUIA experience of the ‘Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo’, illustrating, from the perspective of social occupational therapy, cultural workshops and individual and territorial follow-ups during six months, in the cultural context of a suburb neighborhood in the city of Vitoria, ES, Brazil. Method: The activities collective development aimed at expanding the support of social networks, the empowerment of children and youth participants and the joint construction of processes of autonomy, social participation and life projects to their own cultural identities. Results: The cultural workshops provided the identification of different demands by the children, adolescents and young people, based on the articulation between different views and reflections that were placed in shock through the recognition of alterity between the groups and occupational therapists. Conclusion: It is hoped that the experiments described here can contribute to the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> occupational therapists <b>actions</b> in culture, bringing elements that can promote reflections for a field that still needs to be systematized as a producer of professional practice and research, especially in the social area...|$|R

Global Settings, Comparative Perspectives, that will come out during 2013 {{published}} by Sidestone Press, Leiden, the Netherlands. This book and the present chapter are a major product from the project “Archaeology in Contemporary Europe”, funded by the Culture Program of EU, and lead by INRAP, in which Incipit and Leiden University participated from 2007 to 2012 For the last ten years, the Institute of Heritage Sciences of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and the University of the Republic in Uruguay (Universidad de la República, UdelaR) have had cooperation links. These began as research projects, but have now led {{to the establishment of}} a joint scientific research and work unit. The recent creation of the Landscape Archaeology and Heritage Laboratory (in Spanish, LAPPU), as a scientific unit of the UdelaR, is the final and most outstanding result of this international cooperation. The LAPPU mainly carries out activities in the field of the integrated management of cultural heritage. Its focus is on the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> lines <b>of</b> <b>action</b> aimed at the integration of cultural heritage within public policies, institutional enforcement, knowledge transfer, local development and the socialization and participative construction of heritage through different projects and inter-institutional agreements. In this paper we will present the epistemological basis and the path towards the cooperation we have maintained, exemplified by one of our main projects: The Archaeological Landscape of Lowlands in Uruguay, which took place in the rural areas of Tacuarembó. This archaeological and anthropological project has its foundations in the research-project Situated in Place and in the dialogical interaction between local and global, rural and urban, and traditional and modern, as a way of generating practical knowledge and instruments for local community empowerment. The specific act of researching “other heritages” that represent groups of indigenous peoples and those of African origin who have been marginalized culturally and historically {{in the construction of the}} Uruguayan Nation -State has made it possible to create a platform for multi-vocal and postcolonial articulation on different levels (such as academics, politicians, urban public, rural communities and African descendants). But it has also led us to deal with new ways of approaching heritage (not only in academic practices but also in social processes) involving new actors and including inter-generational dialogues. As a result, participative methodologies emerged as something engaged in the very nature of heritage understood as a social resource. From these experiences, the challenge for the LAPPU will be to de-centralise and create more platforms for the articulation of these multi-vocal approaches to heritage. This project has been funded with support from the European Commission. Peer reviewe...|$|R
