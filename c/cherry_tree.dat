5|$|Another legend {{tells of}} the digging of the church into the ground after the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria (14th–15th centuries), so that the Ottomans would not desecrate it. According to that story, the church was buried and {{forgotten}} about by the villagers until the mid-19th century, when a local coincidentally rediscovered it while tying his donkey to a nearby <b>cherry</b> <b>tree.</b> A different version places the <b>cherry</b> <b>tree</b> {{on top of the}} hill under which the church stood. Reportedly, that <b>cherry</b> <b>tree</b> was struck by a thunderbolt, which enabled the villagers to reach the buried gate through the now-hollow trunk. The church was reconsecrated soon thereafter and dedicated to the 4th-century military saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki.|$|E

British accounts have confirmed that his corpse was found hung upside down after the surrender and this has been repeated in a number of authoritative texts on the Malayan campaign.|$|E

It passes the Uniontown Hospital before ending at US Route 40 Business (Main St.).|$|E
5|$|Albert Benjamin Chandler {{was born}} in the farming {{community}} of Corydon, Kentucky in 1898. He was the eldest child of Joseph Sephus and Callie (Saunders) Chandler. Chandler's father allegedly rescued his mother from an orphanage and married her when she was fifteen, though no record of their marriage has ever been found. In 1899, Chandler's brother Robert was born. Two years later, their mother, still in her teens and unable to cope with raising two young children, abandoned the family. She fled the state and left her sons with their father. In his autobiography, Chandler said his mother leaving them was his earliest memory. Years later, he sought his mother and found her living in Jacksonville, Florida. She had married again and he had three half-siblings. His full brother, Robert Chandler, died when he fell from a <b>cherry</b> <b>tree</b> when he was 13 years old.|$|E
5|$|Grossman and Schafer brainstormed {{regularly}} to devise the time travel puzzles, and collaborated {{with members of}} the development team as well as other LucasArts employees. They would identify puzzle problems and work towards a solution similar to how the game plays. Most issues were addressed prior to programming, but some details were left unfinished to work on later. The staff conceived puzzles involving the U.S.'s early history based on their memory of their compulsory education, and using the more legendary aspects of history, such as George Washington cutting down a <b>cherry</b> <b>tree</b> to appeal to international audiences. To complete the elements, Grossman researched the period to maintain historical accuracy, visiting libraries and contacting reference librarians. The studio, however, took creative license towards facts to fit them into the game's design.|$|E
