2500|$|Millikin's art often {{includes}} self-portraits {{as well as}} {{portraits of}} celebrities and political figures. His work often incorporates mixed media and [...] found objects, such as packages of <b>candy,</b> <b>paper</b> currency, and spiders. His large-scale artwork takes {{full advantage of the}} internet's formal possibilities, and has incorporated animation and winding [...] "infinite canvas" [...] designs, going beyond the limited sizes and shapes of conventional printed pages. Millikin's works range from those made almost completely of text (including [...] calligraphy, typography, anagrams, ambigrams, free verse, and cut-up technique poetry) to those that are optical illusions or completely abstract. Millikin's artwork has been published in books, serialized in newspapers, and displayed in art museums.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to cooking, Cantu had {{a passion for}} inventing. He filed more than 100 patents applications, and signed deals with NASA and Whirlpool for use of his inventions. [...] A 2006 Food & Wine article by Pete Wells declared {{that if he could}} put one dish in a time capsule to explain the food trends of the past year, it would be Cantu's cotton <b>candy</b> <b>paper,</b> not because of its taste, but rather because of the copyright notice on the paper. He explained: [...] "If chefs in the future call their lawyers every time they change their menus, we'll be able to look back on this two-dimensional treat and say, 'This is where it all began.'" ...|$|E
40|$|A data {{processing}} method for hyperspectral images is presented. Each image contains the whole diffuse reflectance spectra of the analyzed material {{for all the}} spatial positions along a specific line of vision. This {{data processing}} method is composed of two blocks: data compression and classification unit. Data compression is performed by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the spectral interpretation algorithm for classification is the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM). This strategy of classification applying PCA and SAM has been successfully tested on the raw material on-line characterization in the tobacco industry. In this application case the desired raw material (tobacco leaves) should be discriminated from other unwanted spurious materials, such as plastic, cardboard, leather, <b>candy</b> <b>paper,</b> etc. Hyperspectral images are recorded by a spectroscopic sensor consisting of a monochromatic camera and a passive Prism- Grating-Prism device. Performance results are compared with a spectral interpretation algorithm based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) ...|$|E
50|$|One crucial {{distinction}} between the two types of Frango chocolates is the packaging. Midwestern Frango chocolates are sold in traditional flat candy boxes, with the chocolates set in <b>candy</b> <b>papers.</b> By contrast, Northwest Frango chocolates are individually wrapped and sold in distinctive hexagon-shaped boxes.|$|R
30|$|The {{child is}} so clever that he’s learned from early {{on when he}} should go to his {{grandparents}} and when he should go to his parents. He goes to the grandpa for candies and roasted sunflower seeds because the grandpa will give him what he wants. He likes candies and chocolates, and {{for quite a while}} sneaked a few every day, which I was not aware of. But he did not know to throw away the <b>candy</b> <b>papers</b> and left them in the drawer. One day I happened to open the drawer and was astonished to see a full drawer of <b>candy</b> <b>papers.</b> I asked my mom about it, who then told me the child ate one piece each day.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Candy</b> {{wrapping}} <b>paper</b> {{and twisting}} paper are thin 30-40 g/m2 kraft papers and are mostly flexo or offset printed. These papers require a good strength, with highly oriented fibers. Twisting paper is mostly opaque and often supercalendered.|$|R
50|$|There {{are some}} unique dishes {{originating}} in Vinh {{and the surrounding}} areas in Nghe An and Ha Tinh, including cháo lươn (spicy eel soup), bánh mướt (steamed rice rolls), kẹo Cu Đơ (peanut rice <b>paper</b> <b>candy),</b> Vinh orange.|$|R

50|$|Finnish people clean {{their homes}} well before Christmas and prepare special treats for the festive season. A sheaf of grain, nuts and seeds are tied on a pole, which {{is placed in}} the garden for the birds to feed on. Spruce trees are cut or bought from a market and taken to homes on or a few days before Christmas Eve and are decorated. Candles are lit on the Christmas tree, which is {{traditionally}} decorated using apples and other fruit, <b>candies,</b> <b>paper</b> flags, cotton and tinsel, in addition to Christmas ornaments such as stars or baubles. Actual candles are no longer used, being replaced by incandescent or LED lamps. A star symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem is placed {{at the top of the}} tree. Just before the Christmas festivities begin, people usually take a Christmas sauna. The tradition is very old; unlike on normal days, when one would go to the sauna in the evening, on Christmas Eve it is done before sunset. This tradition is based on a pre-20th century belief that the spirits of the dead return and have a sauna at the usual sauna hours.|$|R

50|$|In December 1997, Rocco {{introduced}} {{legislation in the}} Assembly that would ban public school students from selling candy and other fundraising items door to door, as well as prohibit programs that offered students incentives for higher sales figures. The bill, which would make New Jersey the second {{in the nation to}} implement such a ban, was proposed following the rape and murder of an 11-year-old boy from Jackson Township while selling <b>candy</b> and wrapping <b>paper</b> to residents near his home.|$|R

25|$|Like {{the rest}} of Mexico, Day of the Dead is celebrated in the state. Two aspects which feature {{prominently}} on altars in this state are mole with turkey and large wax candles. Other items can include black candelabras, incense burners, <b>candy</b> skulls, decorative <b>paper</b> cutouts, oranges and other fruits in season. Leading to these altars often are a line of small candles to guide the returning spirits. One municipality which is particularly known for its events is Huaquechula. Here, altars constructed in homes can be of multiple levels and are usually covered in white paper. On the first level, food and drink are usually placed, with religious objects and objects related to the deceased on the second level.|$|R
5000|$|According to Jackie Hague, Necco's vice {{president}} of marketing, switching to all-natural flavors and colors [...] "would draw young mothers concerned about their children's diet." [...] The new cinnamon flavor is [...] "less like Red Hots", the new lemon, [...] "less like <b>paper</b> <b>candy</b> dots and more like lemon meringue pie filling." [...] The chocolate flavor - previously a vanilla flavor [...] "with a hint of chocolate flavoring" [...] - switches to a more intense all-cocoa flavor. The traditional eighth Necco flavor, lime (green), was dropped in the move to all-natural flavors. [...] In addition, the Necco Chocolate assortment changed from 100% of the standard Necco chocolate wafers into a four-flavor chocolate assortment.|$|R
40|$|Rather than {{represent}} the world merely by photographic means, handmade moving-image artists seek {{to create new}} ways of seeing by staging a variety of interventions into the material makeup of celluloid. Handmade artists tattoo film’s skin not only with scratches and paint, but also with blood, dirt, <b>paper,</b> <b>candy,</b> sand, nail polish remover, and seawater. Seeking media not normally found in a filmmaker or artist’s studio, they mine their own bodies and backyards for things to make into moving images. This program highlights rarely-seen works of artisanal film production from the Coop’s collection. Some of the works are wonderfully constructive, building up the visual surface of the film by combining found footage with painterly abstraction. Others are destructive, subjecting film {{to a variety of}} elemental and material stresses. Taken together, these films not only exhibit the diversity of handmade practices and concerns, they also provide a framework for rethinking how cinema can be made through its unmaking. In other words, handmade cinema—in concept, material, and execution—is counter-cinema...|$|R
60|$|It was {{in all respects}} an {{ordinary}} carful of human beings, and it was perhaps the more worthy to be studied on that account. As in literature the true artist will shun the use even of real events if they are of an improbable character, so the sincere observer of man will not desire to look upon the heroic or occasional phases, but will seek him in his habitual moods of vacancy and tiresomeness. To me, at any rate, he is at such times very precious; and I never perceive him {{to be so much}} a man and a brother as when I feel the pressure of his vast, natural, unaffected dullness. Then I am able to enter confidently into his life and inhabit there, to think his shallow and feeble thoughts, to be moved by his dumb, stupid desires, to be dimly illumined by his stinted inspirations, to share his foolish prejudices, to practice his obtuse selfishness. Yes, it is a very amusing world, if you do not refuse to be amused; and our friends were very willing to be entertained. They delighted in the precise, thick-fingered old ladies who bought sweet apples of the boys come aboard with baskets, and who were so long in finding the right change, that our travellers, leaping in thought with the boys from the moving train, felt that they did so at the peril of their lives. Then they were interested in people who went out and found their friends waiting for them, or else did not find them, and wandered disconsolately up and down before the country stations, carpet-bag in hand; in women who came aboard, and were awkwardly shaken hands with or sheepishly kissed by those who hastily got seats for them, and placed their bags or their babies in their laps, and turned for a nod at the door; in young ladies who were seen to places by young men the latter seemed not to care if the train did go off with them, and then threw up their windows and talked with girl-friends, on the platform without, till the train began to move, and at last turned with gleaming eyes and moist red lips, and panted hard in the excitement of thinking about it, and could not calm themselves to the dull level of the travel around them; in the conductor, coldly and inaccessibly vigilant, as he went his rounds, reaching blindly for the tickets with one hand while he bent his head from time, to time, and listened with a faint, sarcastic smile to the questions of passengers who supposed {{they were going to get}} some information out of him; in the trainboy, who passed through on his many errands with prize <b>candies,</b> gum-drops, pop-corn, <b>papers</b> and magazines, and distributed books and the police journals with a blind impartiality, or a prodigious ignorance, or a supernatural perception of character in those who received them.|$|R
