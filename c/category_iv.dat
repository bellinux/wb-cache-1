40|$|The {{seroprevalence}} of IgG {{antibodies to}} Helicobacter pylori was determined using a standard enzyme linked immunosorbent assay {{in a population}} of 749 randomly selected men, aged 30 - 75 years, from Caerphilly, South Wales. The overall prevalence of H pylori was 56. 9 %, increasing sharply in middle age from 29. 8 % in those aged 30 - 34 to over 59 % in those aged 45 or older (p less than 0. 0001). Age standardised seroprevalence rates were lowest in combined social class categories I and II (49. 2 %), intermediate in categories IIIN and M (57. 5 %), and highest in <b>categories</b> <b>IV</b> and V (62. 2 %) (p = 0. 01). In those aged 30 - 34 years, the prevalence rate for those in combined social class <b>categories</b> <b>IV</b> and V was 57. 9 % - double the rate for social class categories IIIM and N (28. 3 %) and five times the prevalence rate in those in social class categories I and II (11. 1 %).

500|$|The {{restricted}} {{draft and}} fairway is compounded with meandering {{of the river}}'s course—limiting length of vessels—and low bridge clearance. Further problems are incurred through poor transport infrastructure along the route, including poor navigation markings, and presence of sunken vessels and unexploded munitions. Navigation along further [...] of the river upstream to Rugvica near Zagreb is possible for vessels with tonnage below , and {{the section of the}} river belongs to the AGN's Category II. There are plans for restoration of the <b>Category</b> <b>IV</b> compliant waterway downstream of Sisak and betterment of navigation infrastructure between Sisak and Rugvica, as well as upgrading of the waterway between Brčko and Belgrade to Category Va, matching that of the Danube, with uninterrupted navigation through the year. The plan is planned to be supported by the European Union and , an agreement to implement the plan was signed by Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, while Serbia is invited to join the project. The plan aims to increase safety and volume of river transport, which declined by about 70% since the breakup of Yugoslavia, largely because of poor maintenance of the route. The ISRBC is tasked with establishment of an international regime of navigation on the river since 2005.|$|E

2500|$|These {{data are}} {{measured}} through spectrophotometry reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. Higher absorbances imply {{greater levels of}} crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, and thus a greater colouring potential and therefore strength per gram. The absorbance reading of crocin {{is known as the}} [...] "colouring strength" [...] of that saffron. Saffron's colouring strength can range from lower than 80 (for all <b>category</b> <b>IV</b> saffron) up to 200 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive colouring strengths in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than <b>category</b> <b>IV</b> saffron. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO categories. Sargol and coupé saffron would typically fall into ISO 3632 category I. Pushal and mancha would probably be assigned to category II. On many saffron packaging labels, neither the ISO 3632 category nor the colouring strength (the measurement of crocin content) is displayed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{definition}} of conservation targets is strategic {{for the protection}} of biodiversity and must ensure the representativeness and persistence of biodiversity components. This is especially critical in fast-disappearing ecosystems, such as in the Cerrado, where opportunities for conservation are rapidly diminishing. We evaluate how different categories of protected areas (PAs) in the Cerrado contribute to achieve the 17 % conservation target defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Deforestation rates in sustainable use PAs (IUCN <b>categories</b> <b>IV</b> to VI) are similar to those outside PAs, indicating they are not adequate to ensure the protection of biodiversity. Conversely, strict PAs exhibit significantly less deforestation and should form most of the target content. Because strict PAs represent only 3 % of the Cerrado, Brazil is far from achieving the 17 % target defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity. Urgent measures toward the creation of strict PAs in the Cerrado are needed, to ensure the representativeness and persistence of its conspicuous biodiversity...|$|R
