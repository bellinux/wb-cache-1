5|$|From 118 BC to 5 AD, the {{government}} minted over 28,000,000,000 coins, {{with an annual}} average of 220,000,000 coins minted (or 220,000 strings of 1,000 <b>coins).</b> <b>In</b> comparison, the Tianbao period (天寶) (742–755 AD) of the Tang dynasty produced 327,000,000 coins every year while 3,000,000,000 <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> 1045 AD and 5,860,000,000 <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> 1080 AD {{were made in the}} Song dynasty (960–1279 AD). Coin cash became the common measure of wealth during Eastern Han, as many wages were paid solely in cash. Diwu Lun (第五倫) (fl. 40–85 AD), Governor of Shu Province (modern Sichuan), described his subordinate officials' wealth not in terms of landholdings, but in the form of aggregate properties worth approximately 10,000,000 coin cash. Commercial transactions involving hundreds of thousands of coins were commonplace.|$|E

5000|$|Reform coinage was {{introduced}} in 1965 in denominations of 5, 10, 20, and 50 centavos. A 1 peso boliviano <b>coin</b> {{was introduced}} <b>in</b> 1968, a 25-centavo <b>coin</b> <b>in</b> 1971, and a 5 peso boliviano <b>coin</b> <b>in</b> 1976.

25|$|In 2008, the Ministry of Finance and the Royal Thai Mint {{announced}} the 2009 coin series, which included changes in materials to reduce production costs {{as well as}} an update of the image on the obverse to a more recent portrait of the king. The two-baht <b>coin,</b> confusingly similar <b>in</b> color and size to the one-baht coin, was changed from nickel-clad low-carbon steel to aluminium bronze. New two-baht coin {{was the first of the}} new series released on February 3, 2009, followed by a satang <b>coin</b> <b>in</b> April, a five-baht <b>coin</b> <b>in</b> May, a ten-baht <b>coin</b> <b>in</b> June, and a one-baht <b>coin</b> <b>in</b> July 2009.|$|R

5|$|La Cotte de St Brelade is a Palaeolithic site {{inhabited}} before {{rising sea}} levels transformed Jersey into an island. Jersey was a centre of Neolithic activity, {{as demonstrated by}} the concentration of dolmens. Evidence of Bronze Age and early Iron Age settlements can be found in many locations around the island. In June 2012 it was announced what could be Europe's largest hoard of Iron Age coins had been found in Grouville by two persons using metal detectors. The hoard may be worth up to £10 M. People had been searching for this treasure for 30 years. It was reported that the hoard weighed about three quarters of a tonne and could contain up to 50,000 Roman and Celtic <b>coins.</b> <b>In</b> 2012 the same two men had found 60 Iron Age <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> the same area.|$|E
5|$|Public {{dissatisfaction with}} the newly-issued Morgan dollar led the Mint's {{engravers}} to submit designs for the smaller silver <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> 1879. Among those who called for new coinage was editor Richard Watson Gilder of The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Sometime in the early 1880s, he, along {{with one of his}} reporters and sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens visited Mint Director Burchard to argue for the creation of new designs. They brought along classic Greek and Roman <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to persuade Burchard that the coinage could easily be made more beautiful. The visitors left disappointed, after learning that Burchard considered the much-criticized Morgan dollar as beautiful as any of them.|$|E
5|$|The author Jim Butcher {{uses the}} <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> his Dresden Files series, {{in which each}} coin {{is the focal point}} of a fallen angel. This group of angels is known as the Order of the Blackened Denarius, or the Denarians.|$|E

50|$|The New Zealand two-dollar coin is the largest-denomination coin of the New Zealand dollar. It was {{introduced}} {{along with the}} one-dollar <b>coin</b> <b>in</b> 1990. Both are made from an alloy of aluminium and brass. It is the largest and heaviest <b>coin</b> <b>in</b> circulation, weighing ten grams and measuring 26.5 millimetres in diameter. Its thickness is 2.7 mm, only 0.4 mm thinner than the one-dollar coin, thus it is the second-thickest <b>coin</b> <b>in</b> the country's circulation.|$|R
2500|$|In contrast, {{ideographic}} compounds {{are common}} among characters <b>coined</b> <b>in</b> Japan. Also, a few characters <b>coined</b> <b>in</b> China in modern times, such as [...] platinum, [...] "white metal" [...] (see chemical elements in East Asian languages) belong to this category.|$|R
5|$|The coins were minted {{under three}} dynasties of Roman emperors. The {{earliest}} are the successors of the Constantinian dynasty, {{followed by the}} Valentinianic emperors, and finally the Theodosian emperors. The collegiate system of rule (or Consortium imperii) meant that imperial partners would mint <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> each other's names at the mints under their jurisdiction. The overlapping reigns of Eastern and Western emperors often allow changes of type to be dated to within part of a reign. So the latest <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> the hoard, of Western ruler Honorius (393–423) and his challenger Constantine III (407–11), can be demonstrated {{to belong to the}} earlier parts of their reigns as they correspond to the lifetime of the Eastern Emperor Arcadius, who died in 408. Thus, the coins provide a terminus post quem or earliest possible date for the deposition of the hoard of 408.|$|E
5|$|The {{constant}} {{width of}} these shapes allows their use as coins {{that can be}} used in coin-operated machines. For instance, the United Kingdom has made 20-pence and 50-pence <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> the shape of a Reuleaux heptagon. The Canadian Loonie dollar coin uses another Reuleaux polygon with 11 sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{huge number}} of clipped <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> the Hoxne Hoard has made it {{possible}} for archaeologists to observe the process of coin-clipping in detail. The coins were evidently cut face-up to avoid damaging the portrait. The average level of clipping is roughly the same for coins dating from 350 onwards.|$|E

5|$|The medalet {{is part of}} {{the only}} late-6th or early-7th century find of gold {{jewellery}} in a grave in a churchyard. All of the <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> the hoard were probably part of a necklace that was buried in a woman's grave. The medalet itself is the earliest surviving Anglo-Saxon coin.|$|E
5|$|The {{possible}} {{reasons for the}} clipping of coins are controversial. Possible explanations include fraud, a deliberate attempt to maintain a stable ratio between gold and silver coins, or an official attempt to provide {{a new source of}} silver bullion while maintaining the same number of <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> circulation.|$|E
5|$|A {{platform}} {{running game}} titled Chennai Express: Escape from Rameshwaram, {{based on the}} film and featuring Shahrukh Khan & Deepika Padukone, was developed by Disney UTV's digital wing, and launched on 24 July 2013 for Android systems.

5|$|By 1935, the <b>coins,</b> <b>in</b> uncirculated condition, {{sold for}} about $2, a price {{increased}} by fifty cents during the commemorative coin boom of 1936. They had subsided to the $2 level by 1940, but thereafter increased steadily in value, peaking at $825 {{during the second}} commemorative coin boom in 1980. The 2018 edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2017, lists the coin for between $250 and $750, depending on condition. An exceptional specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $7,344.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{proposed}} that the U.S. dollar should have fractional coins using decimals, rather than eighths like the Spanish coinage. This innovation was originally suggested by Superintendent of Finance Robert Morris, with whom Hamilton corresponded after examining one of Morris's Nova Constellatio <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> 1783. He also desired the minting of small value coins, such as silver ten-cent and copper cent and half-cent pieces, for reducing {{the cost of living}} for the poor. One of his main objectives was for the general public to become accustomed to handling money on a frequent basis.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{the approval of the}} new five-cent coin, the Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, had begun preparing designs and pattern <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> 1865. After rejecting pieces showing deceased presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch decided on a design similar to Longacre's two-cent piece, with a shield on the obverse and a numeral 5 surrounded by stars and rays on the reverse. This {{has come to be known}} as the Shield nickel.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the origin and early years of Jakub Świnka, except for his mention in a {{document}} issued by Bolesław the Pious. As Archbishop of Gniezno, the cooperation between him and Przemysł II was excellent. One example of this was the fact that he appeared as witness in 14 diplomats issued by the Duke of Greater Poland, including the confirmation of all his existing privileges and the permission to mint his own <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> Żnin and the castellany of Ląd.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bronze and}} silver coins have mainly {{been found in}} Aksum territory, with very few pieces found in Judea, Meroë and Egypt. They are based roughly {{on the size of}} older Roman As and Sestertius in shape and thickness. The design also {{developed}} like Roman <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> first being good but then the pictures turn archaic and non recognisable. The name is unknown so it is referred to as an Æ diameter in mm Unit, like Æ17 for a coin of 17mm.|$|E
5|$|Some 5,000,000 half dollars were struck, {{far beyond}} the actual demand, and half of them were melted. The {{appropriation}} did not cure the fair's financial woes, as fewer than 400,000 were sold at the premium price, and some 2,000,000 were released into circulation, where they remained {{as late as the}} 1950s. The pieces can be purchased in circulated condition for less than $20; <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> near-pristine state sell for about $1,000, far less than the $10,000 the makers of the Remington Typewriter paid as a publicity stunt in 1892 for the first specimen struck.|$|E
