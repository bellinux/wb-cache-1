25|$|Residents were {{subjected}} to a mix of mandatory and voluntary evacuations, depending on the projected path of a fire. Hundreds of thousands of residents were notified of evacuations via a computerized Reverse 911 phone <b>call</b> <b>system.</b> While this alert system was mostly effective, many residents in Rancho Bernardo received the calls after they had been driven from their homes. On the other hand, in Carmel Valley, only the northern half was officially evacuated, but a computer error mistakenly sent Reverse 911 calls to the southern half as well. Law enforcement officers also notified residents by driving through evacuation areas. On October 24, 2007, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Kolender stated {{that the number of}} people evacuated in San Diego county had exceeded the number evacuated from New Orleans, Louisiana during Hurricane Katrina.|$|E

25|$|The {{launch of}} the Stock Exchange Automated Trading System (SEATS). It {{was a far cry}} from the {{original}} system which dated back over 100 years. During that time there had been three different forms of trading on the Australian stock exchanges. The earliest was the auction-based <b>call</b> <b>system,</b> which saw a stock exchange employee (the caller) call the name of each listed security in turn while members bid, offered, sold or bought the stock at each call. This system proved inadequate to handle the increased volume of trading during the mining booms. It was replaced by the 'post' system in the early 1960s, which involved stocks being quoted on 'posts' or 'boards'. 'Chalkies' were employed by the Stock Exchange and it was their function to record in chalk the bids and offers of the operators (employees of stockbrokers) and the sales made. This system stayed in place until 1991.|$|E

We propose a novel <b>system</b> <b>call</b> interposition <b>system</b> <b>called</b> Paladin. In Paladin <b>system</b> <b>call</b> accesscontrol decisions are made by policy handlers, i. e. reference monitor procedures, built into applications. This represents a fundamental perspective shift from previous <b>system</b> <b>call</b> interposition work.

In contrast, previous <b>system</b> <b>call</b> interposition <b>systems</b> attempt to protect computers from untrusted application binaries.
