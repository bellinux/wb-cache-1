5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) {{is asked}} to visit the Dunder Mifflin {{branches}} to lecture about his success in Scranton. He and Pam (Jenna Fischer), who is <b>coming</b> <b>along</b> as his assistant and driver, plan to visit every branch except Nashua because Michael {{is not ready to}} face his ex-girlfriend Holly, who works there. They first visit the Utica branch, where former Scranton employee Karen (Rashida Jones) is now regional manager. Pam, who is engaged to Karen's ex-boyfriend Jim (John Krasinski), fears the encounter will be awkward. But Karen is now married and pregnant, and the two get along very well – when Pam reveals her and Jim's engagement, Karen even offers genuine congratulations. Michael's lecture in Utica proves to be a disaster when he tries to teach the employees a trick for how to memorize names and ends up insulting everybody. Nevertheless, Pam is ecstatic to have found closure with Karen. Later, on the road, Michael tells Pam that he never found closure with Holly and, at Pam's suggestion, they decide to blow off the other lectures and drive to Nashua to find Holly.|$|E
5|$|North Korean troops {{continued}} {{attacking the}} 24th Infantry all across its line, probing for weaknesses. On August 25 and 26, C Company beat off several more North Korean attacks on Battle Mountain <b>coming</b> <b>along</b> the long ridge extending from Tundok. At {{one point in}} these fights, a flight of US Air Force aircraft caught about 100 North Korean soldiers in the open and immediately napalmed, bombed, and strafed them. The North Korean force was destroyed with few survivors. Task Force Baker, comprising C Company and a platoon of E Company, 24th Infantry with an ROK police company, defended Battle Mountain at this time. The special command was established because of the isolated Battle Mountain area and the extended regimental battle front. For the next two days, air strikes continued to rack North Korean counterattacks and {{to prevent them from}} forming into any serious attack on Battle Mountain.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{continued}} to prosper through the 1920s and 1930s with a toll of one quarter {{to cross the}} bridge, with drivers of State Highway Route 6 <b>coming</b> <b>along</b> the bridge from the junction with State Highway Route 8 coming across the bridge since 1927. During the 1920s and 1930s, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to buy out bridges along the Delaware River under the Joint Commission for the Elimination of Toll Bridges. The reconstructed bridge at Belvidere was bought by the commission for $60,000 (1920s USD) and the covered bridge at Columbia for only $50,000. Although the commission tried to buy the second-hand railroad bridge for a lower, unspecified amount, Darlington used his strong bargaining skills to raise the amount to $275,000, {{a far cry from}} the other local bridges. Residents of Knowlton Township, New Jersey rejoiced at the fact of when the bridge was bought, tolls were eliminated from the crossing. The new generation of people prospered at the thought that the crossing the Delaware would be forever free.|$|E

25|$|Oh, I'm now {{fully aware}} of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My {{awareness}} was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set in 1990.

The whole thing is about passing it on, because that's how it was done for me when I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly records. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone carries the flame on.|$|E

25|$|Plasma screens on the {{platforms}} show passengers {{when the}} next two trains are <b>coming,</b> <b>along</b> with advertisements and public service announcements. The subway cars contain LCD screens showing advertisements and on some lines, the next stop, while above-ground trains have LED screens showing the next stop. The LED screens are being phased in on Line 1 and are also included in lines 7 and 9, two underground lines. There are recorded messages stating the next stop in Mandarin, English, and (on line 16 only) Shanghainese, but the messages stating nearby attractions or shops for a given station (a form of paid advertising) are in Mandarin only. The metro operating company is resistant to expanding use of Shanghainese for announcing stops, on the basis that, on most lines, the majority of passengers can understand either Mandarin or English.|$|E

25|$|The second notable action {{occurred}} on 17 August {{off the coast}} of Cuba. At 1 p.m. Racoon sighted a brig <b>coming</b> <b>along</b> shore and that met up with a schooner that had been avoiding the British all day. At 3 p.m. the two came up together, but Racoon held back. Then at 4:15 the brig hoisted French colours and opened fire on Racoon. Racoon and the brig exchanged broadsides, with Racoons fire bringing down most of the brigs rigging. The brig ran on shore on the rocks in a small bay, where she struck her colours. After some maneuvering, Racoon fired a broadside from her other side to try to destroy the brig. After about half an hour, the brig raised her colours again. Racoon made several passes, firing on the brig, which lost her mainmast near sunset, and fell on her side. The brig sent her crew ashore in boats while Racoon watched all night. In the morning {{it was clear that the}} brig was a complete wreck, having lost her masts and being full of water. Bissell decided not to permit Racoons master to take a boat and some men to the brig to burn her because there were too many armed men on shore who would fire on any boarding party. Also, Racoon had her two lieutenants and 42 men away in the prizes she had taken the previous month.|$|E
