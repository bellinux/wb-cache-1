40|$|YAG:Ce {{transparent}} ceramics {{with high}} luminous efficiency and <b>color</b> <b>render</b> index were prepared via a solid state reaction-vacuum sintering method. Cr 3 + and Pr 3 + {{were applied to}} expand the spectrum of YAG:Ce transparent ceramics. As prepared ceramics exhibit luminescence spectrum ranging from 500 nm to 750 nm, which almost covers full range of visible light. After the concentration optimization of Ce 3 +, Pr 3 + and Cr 3 +, high quality white light was obtained by coupling the YAG:Ce,Pr,Cr ceramics with commercial blue LED chips. Color coordinates of the YAG:Ce,Pr,Cr ceramics under 450 nm LED excitation vary from cold white light to warm white light region. The highest luminous efficiency of WLEDs encapsulated by transparent YAG:Ce,Pr,Cr ceramic was 89. 3 Im/W, while its <b>color</b> <b>render</b> index can reach nearly 80. Energy transfers between Ce 3 + -> Pr 3 + and Ce 3 + -> Cr 3 + were proved in co-doped ceramic system.

25|$|The {{correlated}} {{color temperature}} of factory installed automotive HID headlamps is between 4100K and 5000K while tungsten-halogen lamps are at 3000K to 3550K. The spectral power distribution (SPD) of an automotive HID headlamp is discontinuous and spikey while the SPD of a filament lamp, {{like that of the}} sun, is a continuous curve. Moreover, the <b>color</b> <b>rendering</b> index (CRI) of tungsten-halogen headlamps (98) is much closer than that of HID headlamps (~75) to standardized sunlight (100). Studies have shown no significant safety effect of this degree of CRI variation in headlighting.|$|E
25|$|The {{spectrum}} of light emitted from a fluorescent lamp {{is the combination}} of light directly emitted by the mercury vapor, and light emitted by the phosphorescent coating. The spectral lines from the mercury emission and the phosphorescence effect give a combined spectral distribution of light {{that is different from}} those produced by incandescent sources. The relative intensity of light emitted in each narrow band of wavelengths over the visible spectrum is in different proportions compared to that of an incandescent source. Colored objects are perceived differently under light sources with differing spectral distributions. For example, some people find the color rendition produced by some fluorescent lamps to be harsh and displeasing. A healthy person can sometimes appear to have an unhealthy skin tone under fluorescent lighting. The extent to which this phenomenon occurs is related to the light's spectral composition, and may be gauged by its <b>color</b> <b>rendering</b> index (CRI).|$|E

2500|$|Rea and Freyssinier have {{developed}} another index, the Gamut Area Index (GAI), {{in an attempt}} to improve over the flaws found in the CRI.

[...] Proponents of using GAI claim that, when used in conjunction with CRI, this method of evaluating <b>color</b> <b>rendering</b> is preferred by test subjects over light sources that have high values of only one measure. [...] Researchers recommend a lower and an upper limit to GAI.

2500|$|CFLs emit {{light from}} a mix of phosphors, each {{emitting}} one band of colour with some bands still in the ultraviolet range {{as can be seen}} on the light spectrum. This is the reason why additional UV filtering, for example double-envelope, is required to reduce damage to the retina. [...] Modern phosphor designs balance the emitted light color, energy efficiency, and cost. Every extra phosphor added to the coating mix improves <b>color</b> <b>rendering</b> but decreases efficiency and increases cost. Good quality consumer CFLs use three or four phosphors to achieve a [...] "white" [...] light with a <b>color</b> <b>rendering</b> index (CRI) of about 80, where the maximum 100 represents the appearance of colors under daylight or other sources of black-body radiation such as an incandescent light bulb (depending on the correlated color temperature).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Color</b> <b>rendering</b> index (CRI) is {{a measure}} of how well colors can be {{perceived}} using light from a source, relative to light from a reference source such as daylight or a blackbody of the same color temperature.

Skin appears less pink, and hence [...] "unhealthy" [...] compared with incandescent lighting. Colored objects appear muted.
