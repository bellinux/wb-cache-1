2500|$|Each Morse <b>code</b> <b>symbol</b> {{represents}} {{either a}} text character (letter or numeral) or a prosign and {{is represented by}} a unique sequence of dots and dashes. The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in code transmission. The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot. Each dot or dash {{is followed by a}} short silence, equal to the dot duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots (one dash), and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots. To increase the speed of the communication, the code was designed so that the length of each character in Morse is approximately inverse to its frequency of occurrence in English. Thus the most common letter in English, the letter [...] "E", has the shortest code, a single dot.|$|E

3000|$|We {{note that}} the code [...] C {{is nothing but a}} [7, 3, 4] Simplex code which we study in Section 7. It follows from the {{analysis}} presented in Section 7 that this code has (r= 3,ℓ= 2)-cooperative locality, i.e., any set of ℓ= 2 failed <b>code</b> <b>symbols</b> can be recovered by contacting r= 3 other <b>code</b> <b>symbols.</b> Let us assume that the <b>code</b> <b>symbols</b> a and a+b are in failure. In this case, we can recover both the failed <b>code</b> <b>symbols</b> from the set of r= 3 <b>code</b> <b>symbols</b> (b,b + c,a + b + c). In other words, (a,a + b,b,b + c,a + b + c) form a punctured code of the original code [...] C at r+ℓ= 5 indices. However, this punctured code does not have minimum distance at least ℓ+ 1 =δ= 3. This can easily be observed {{from the fact that the}} punctured sub-code does not allow the repair of two <b>code</b> <b>symbols</b> b + c and a + b + c from the remaining set of three <b>code</b> <b>symbols</b> (a,a + b,b). Moreover, there is no punctured codes of the original code at at most r+ℓ= 5 indices which has minimum distance at least ℓ+ 1 = 3. Therefore, [...] C is an example of a code with (r= 3,ℓ= 2)-cooperative locality which does not have (r= 3,δ=ℓ+ 1 = 3)-locality as defined in [16].|$|R

In AFC, {{the number of}} generated <b>coded</b> <b>symbols</b> is potentially limitless. In contrast to the conventional binary rateless <b>codes,</b> each <b>coded</b> <b>symbol</b> in AFC is a real-valued symbol, generated as a weighted sum of $d$ randomly selected information bits, where $d$ and the weight coefficients are randomly selected from predefined probability mass functions. The <b>coded</b> <b>symbols</b> are then directly transmitted through wireless channels. We analyze the error probability of AFC and design the weight set to minimize the error probability. Simulation results show that AFC achieves {{the capacity of the}} Gaussian channel {{in a wide range of}} signal to noise ratio (SNR). Comment: To appear in IEEE Communications Letter...|$|R

5000|$|A full Aztec <b>code</b> <b>symbol</b> has, in {{addition}} to the core, a [...] "reference grid" [...] of alternating black and white pixels occupying every 16th row and column. These known pixels allow a reader to maintain alignment with the pixel grid over large symbols. For up to 4 layers (31×31 pixels), this consists only of single lines extending outward from the core, continuing the alternating pattern. Inside the 5th layer, however, additional rows and columns of alternating pixels are inserted ±16 pixels from the center, so the 5th layer is located ±17 and ±18 pixels from the center, and a 5-layer symbol is 37×37 pixels.|$|E

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the short dot and dash signals and their ever-present adjacent dot duration silent periods, Morse <b>code</b> <b>symbols</b> are of longer duration than signals and are composed of unique dot/dash sequences of Morse signals and silent periods. Morse <b>code</b> <b>symbols</b> are separated from each other by at least a three dot duration inter-symbol silent period. Morse <b>code</b> <b>symbols</b> represent alpha-numeric, punctuation and prosign characters. Each such long duration symbol consists of a unique sequence {{of two or more}} of the three basic elements (dot, dash, silent period), e.g. the unique sequence for the English letter [...] "C" [...] is (...)

50|$|The {{thick black}} border around the symbol {{is called the}} Bearer Bar. The purpose of a Bearer Bar is to equalise the {{pressure}} exerted by the printing plate over the entire surface of the symbol, and to enhance reading reliability by helping to reduce the probability of misreadsor short scans that may occur when the scanner is held to a bar code at too large an angle. Such instances of skewed scanning cause the scanning beam to enter or exit the bar <b>code</b> <b>symbol</b> through the Bearer Bar at its top or bottom edge, forcing the scanner to detect an invalid scan since Bearer Bars are much wider than a legitimate black bar.|$|E
