40|$|Abstract: The paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which indicated Premium Risk Factors (PRFs) and Reserve Risk Factors (RRFs) are related to <b>ceded</b> <b>reinsurance</b> usage. Prior DCWP work found that company insurance impairment probabilities generally increase as <b>ceded</b> <b>reinsurance</b> usage increases. 1 In this report, we show that that PRFs and RRFs are higher for companies with an elevated reinsurance usage for all-lines combined, for nearly all lines of business (LOBs) and generally across LOB-sizes than for companies with lower usage. This result allows us to connect the earlier impairment rate findings, which did not imply particular capital charges to mitigate the increased risk, to the indicated risk charges for the RBC formula. This is one of several papers being issued by the Risk Based Capital (RBC) Dependencies and Calibration Working Party...|$|R

40|$|The {{fluctuations}} of {{the foreign}} exchange (FX) rates {{are a source of}} additional risk, but also an opportunity for further profits for internationally operating reinsurers. A DFA model that includes FX rates can be a means for measuring the potential impact of FX rate fluctuations on portfolios of <b>ceded</b> <b>reinsurance</b> and internationally invested assets. Moreover, such a DFA model can also be a means for testing different strategies for managing FX risk. We start by surveying the empirical properties of FX rate data and introduce some simple approaches for generating FX scenarios. We then study the different ways in which reinsurers are exposed to FX risk, and possible strategies for managing these risks. The emphasis is on so-called on-balance sheet currency hedging techniques, i. e. on offsetting FX risks on reinsurance contracts by investing appropriate amounts of money in the respective foreign currency. The theoretical reasonings are accompanied by a DFA study on an international loss portfolio. This study shows that FX fluctuations can {{have an impact on the}} reinsurer's business, and that the optimal strategy may not be a full hedge depending on the type of business and on the economic circumstances.

40|$|Risks {{management}} means identifying them, assessing, quantifying {{and strategy}} to counter them, and finding solutions to some levers to diminish or even eliminate {{the possibility of}} developing or their consequences. Hung everywhere, risk is associated with uncertain situations and opportunities. The consequences of risk can result in adverse or positive effects related to {{the activity of the}} insurance undertaking or of the <b>reinsurance</b> <b>undertaking.</b> The risk has a pronounced randomly character, and its presence in the field of insurance undertakings and reinsurance. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that the risks are taken by these companies and have direct effects on their financial results during the period of validity of the contractual relations. The results of risk effects have an impact on the results of activity of insurance companies. The financial impact of a negative event, exceed the sum of the individual loss, leading in some cases to bankruptcy. The financial impact is due to the positive opportunities, which have not made an appearance, and the first event to transform into income. An important role is the responsibility of the information system, providing solutions based on scenarios, by electronic data processing, consider all types of consequences of a hazard and allow insurance companies and reinsurance, on the other hand, to calculate all the possible consequences of a given event and the ultimate financial impact on them, and finally, to make decisions to base decisions for various insurance products and reinsurance.

In practice the scenario method is only used to make specific estimates for different scenarios depending on the circumstances, which has a certain probability of realization, for the favorable; for the neutral and negative and gives solutions for each individual, taking into account certain criteria.

First, we show how the optimal reinsurance design for the <b>ceding</b> company, the <b>reinsurance</b> company and the social planner can be formulated in the same way. Second, by introducing the marginal indemnification functions, we characterize the optimal reinsurance contracts. We show that, for an optimal policy, the associated marginal indemnification function only takes the values zero and one.

50|$|Probable Maximum Loss (PML) is a {{term used}} in the {{insurance}} industry as well as Commercial Real Estate. Although the definition is not consistent in the insurance industry, it is generally defined as {{the value of the}} largest loss that could result from a disaster, assuming the normal functioning of passive protective features (e.g. firewalls, nonflammable materials, flood defences etc.) and proper functioning of most (perhaps not all) active suppression systems (e.g. sprinklers). This loss estimate is always less than (or in rare cases, equal to) the Maximum Foreseeable Loss, which assumes the failure of all active protective features. Underwriting decisions can be influenced by PML evaluations, and the amount of <b>reinsurance</b> <b>ceded</b> on a risk can be predicated on the PML valuation.|$|R

We divided the roughly 5 trillion yen of risk that is currently retained by Japan’s earthquake insurance program into 21 layers, starting with four successive layers in the 200 billion yen to 1 trillion yen group and ending with four successive layers in the 4. 2 to 5 trillion yen group. We then compared the price of risk (reinsurance premiums necessary for reducing one unit of risk) for the different layers. Our analysis indicated that the four layers in the 1. 4 to 2. 2 trillion yen group could be reinsured for the lowest price per unit risk. Hence, if these successive four layers were <b>ceded,</b> the <b>reinsurance</b> premiums to be paid under the base case would be 42. 5 billion yen (a 5. 31 % reinsurance premium rate is applied for ceding 800 billion yen risk), thereby making possible risk reduction {{on the order of}} 698. 5 billion (99 % Tail VaR) ...|$|R
40|$|Discriminant {{analysis}} is a supervised learning technique {{that can be}} used in order to determine which variables are the best predictors of the classification of objects belonging to a population into predetermined classes. At the same time, discriminant analysis provides a powerful tool that enables researchers to make predictions regarding the classification of new objects into predefined classes. The main goal of discriminant {{analysis is}} to determine which of the N descriptive variables have the most discriminatory power, that is, which of them are the most relevant for the classification of objects into classes. In order to classify objects, we need a mathematical model that provides the rules for optimal allocation. This is the classifier. In this paper we will discuss three of the most important models of classification: the Bayesian criterion, the Mahalanobis criterion and the Fisher criterion. In this paper, we will use discriminant analysis to classify the insurance companies that operated on the Romanian market in 2006. We have selected a number of eigth (8) relevant variables: gross written premium (GR_WRI_PRE), net mathematical reserves (NET_M_PES), gross claims paid (GR_CL_PAID), net premium reserves (NET_PRE_RES), net claim reserves (NET_CL_RES), net income (NE—_INCOME), share capital (SHARE_CAP) and gross written premium <b>ceded</b> in <b>Reinsurance</b> (GR_WRI_PRE_CED).

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of {{reinsurance}} networks in an insurer’s reinsurance purchase decision. Drawing on network theory, we develop a framework that delineates how the pattern of linkages among reinsurers determines three reinsurance costs (loadings, contagion costs, and search and monitoring costs) and characterizes an insurer’s optimal network structure. Consistent with empirical evidence based on longitudinal data from the U. S. property and casualty insurance industry, our model predicts an inverted U-shaped relationship between the insurer’s optimal percentage of <b>reinsurance</b> <b>ceded</b> {{and the number of}} its reinsurers. Moreover, we find that a linked network may be optimal ex ante even though linkages among reinsurers may spread financial contagion, supporting the model’s prediction regarding social capital benefits associated with network cohesion. Our theoretical model and empirical results have implications for other networks such as loan sale market networks and over-the-counter dealer networks...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – In the USA, private {{insurance}} companies {{serve as an}} integral part of the delivery and risk sharing of the federal crop insurance program. Governed by the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA), private crop insurance companies must designate an eligible crop insurance contract to the assigned risk, developmental, or commercial funds. While the SRA restricts the private sector delivery system in a number of ways, the assignment of contracts to crop insurance funds, however, is left solely to the discretion of individual crop insurance companies. Thus, as to the companies' profitability viewpoint, the optimal selection of the crop insurance funds is the most important task. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide a decision framework for crop insurance companies to make optimal decisions regarding the purchases of crop reinsurance. This information and framework may also be useful for crop insurance firms in China when considering crop reinsurance decisions. Design/methodology/approach – The paper studied three commonly used parametric loss distributions and presented a general guideline to choose the most profitable fund within the company's risk bearing level. Findings – The paper finds many important features in the commonly used loss distributions, which are useful to maximize the company's underwriting returns. Originality/value – The paper provides a general decision framework for optimally <b>ceding</b> risks to <b>reinsurance.</b> While this paper focused on agricultural insurance decisions by firms, the concept could be applied to general reinsurance decisions.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the joint impact of earnings management incentives (i. e., income smoothing, solvency management and tax management) and reinsurance, {{together with other}} institutional factors, on the magnitude and direction of claim (loss) reserves errors in the UK’s property-liability insurance industry. Two reserve error definitions, found in literature, are employed to conduct the analysis. Furthermore, a panel data generalised methods of moments (GMM) estimator is employed to incorporate the dynamic nature of current and past loss reserving errors. Using the GMM estimator in a panel of 151 firms over a period from 1991 and 2005, the study finds support for the conclusions of some prior studies but also inconsistencies with other previous research. The present study finds that the inferences drawn from empirical analyses can {{be influenced by the}} definition of loss reserving errors and to some extent how other incentive variables are defined. The {{results of this study suggest}} that discretionary loss reserving behaviour tends to persist from one year to another. Therefore, ignoring the dynamic nature of loss reserving errors could lead to biased and unreliable conclusions. The empirical results of this study also find that property-liability insurance managers manipulate claims reserves in order to smooth company’s earnings across accounting periods. Furthermore, empirical evidence is found which indicates that high levels of <b>reinsurance</b> <b>ceded</b> help to reduce the incidence of error in loss reserves. Contrary to expectations, the evidence presented in this thesis suggests that highly solvent insurers under-estimate their claims liabilities. However, no empirical support is found to indicate that insurers over-reserve in order to reduce and/or postpone period tax liabilities. The study also produced mixed results regarding the relation between the type of reinsurance cover used and claim reserve errors. Nevertheless, the empirical results show that firm-specific effects, such as company size and product mix, can have effect on the accuracy of insurers’ reserves. Finally, as this study gives an important insight on discretionary loss reserve manipulation, its conclusions could be of interest and relevance to the business decisions of investors, policyholders, regulators, and other interested parties (e. g., credit rating agencies and accounting standard settlers) ...|$|R
