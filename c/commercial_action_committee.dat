40|$|The {{presented}} bachelor thesis <b>Action</b> <b>Committees</b> of the National Front and the Culture aims {{to present}} <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> {{as an institution}} that acted as a gearing-lever of the communist regime after February 1948. The thesis places great emphasis on their cathartic function - {{that is the way}} in which the society got rid of artists with a hostile look at the newly-built socialistic-democratic state. On the basis of specific cases not only penalty criteria are assessed, but also the selection of victims, political manipulation, and also a measure of the impact on personal and professional life of artists. Attention is also paid to the rising tide of protests against decisions of the <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> during the first half of 1948 and its suppression by a new law that re-legalized the activities of <b>action</b> <b>committees.</b> In the last part of the thesis activities of <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> in the second half of 1948 are depicted. This is the period when the main task of cleansing the society has already been achieved, therefore <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> slowly began to lose their status. My goal was to show the transformation of <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> from an institution, which society formed and reformed, into an organization that society merely tolerated...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{public choice}} {{literature}} and casual observation {{suggest that the}} behavior of political <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> is remarkably unsophisticated, meaning that political <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> give to those legislators who would support their interests anyway. Thus, {{it is suggested that}} contributor behavior deviates from rational behavior, which is a cornerstone of economic analysis. In this paper, a switching regression model is estimated that allows for strategies of political <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> to vary for different contribution recipients. The author analyzes the behavior of farm political <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> over three election cycles. In contrast to previous findings, he finds that contributor behavior is not inconsistent with rational behavior. Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|R

Two related equations derived from the theoretical model [...] a probit equation for political <b>action</b> <b>committee</b> sponsorship and a disbursements equation [...] are estimated using pooled data on 226 government (primarily defense) contracting firms during the 1979 - 80 and 1981 - 82 election cycles.
