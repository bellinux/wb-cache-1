5|$|The crowd {{moved away}} from the {{immediate}} area of the custom house, but continued to grow in nearby streets. Captain Preston immediately called out most of the 29th Regiment, which adopted defensive positions in front of the state house. Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson was summoned to the scene, and was forced by the movement of the <b>crowd</b> <b>into</b> the council chamber of the state house. From its balcony he was able to minimally restore order, promising there would be a fair inquiry into the shootings if the crowd dispersed.|$|E
5|$|The next day, on Christmas, Aya and her partner, Daniel, {{go to see}} a {{scientist}} at the Museum of Natural History named Dr. Klamp. He teaches the protagonists about mitochondria, {{but they do not}} find his information useful since it does not explain the previous night's events. Later that day, they hear that Eve is in Central Park, and to make matters worse, an audience has gathered at the park's theater intending to see a performance that Melissa Pearce was to give. Aya enters Central Park alone as Daniel is unable to pass through the entrance without spontaneously combusting. She makes it to the theater, but is too late to stop Eve, who causes the theater audience's mitochondria to rebel against their hosts and turns the <b>crowd</b> <b>into</b> a slimy orange mass. Aya chases after Eve and is knocked unconscious after a fight with her aboard a horse-drawn carriage. Daniel discovers that his son, Ben, was at the park, but had left the audience at the Central Park theater when he began to feel ill and when his mother began to act strange. He also learns that Manhattan is being evacuated due to the threat that Eve poses.|$|E

The poorer residents <b>crowd</b> <b>into</b> downtown areas or large slums, many without running water or basic services. The more wealthy live in beachside mansions in the city's northern districts.|$|E
25|$|At the courthouse, {{the crowd}} had swollen to nearly 2,000, many of them now armed. Several local leaders, {{including}} Reverend Charles W.

Gustafson, later claimed {{that he tried to}} talk the <b>crowd</b> <b>into</b> going home.|$|E

25|$|After {{defeating}} Cambridge United 4–0 at {{home and}} Blyth Spartans 1–3 away, Torquay were drawn against Leeds United, away, {{in the third round}} of the Cup. Torquay were not expected to go to Elland Road and get any kind of favourable result, yet they managed to hold the Yorkshire club to a 2–2 draw; the scene was thus set for over 11,000 fans to <b>crowd</b> <b>into</b> Plainmoor on the afternoon of Wednesday, 12 January.|$|E
25|$|The Near East University {{annually}} holds {{a spring}} fest, during which famous Turkish Cypriot, Turkish and international singers and bands perform, dance festivals, sports and board game competitions are held. In 2014, the university built the Park Near East on {{an area of}} 220,000 thousand square metres, and the concerts of Deep Purple and Turkish bands such as Yüksek Sadakat drew {{tens of thousands of}} spectators from Cyprus and Turkey. During the festival, the Moscow State Ballet also performed in the university. It also hosts the annual Rock 'n Cyprus festival, at which bands from Turkey perform, and organizes the NEU Nicosia Carnival at the Dereboyu region of the city, at which the students display their culture and the locals <b>crowd</b> <b>into</b> the streets.|$|E
25|$|By 1 August {{the route}} {{had been pushed}} as far as Camp VIII, {{at the base of}} the Shoulder at around 7800m, and the next day the whole team {{assembled}} there to prepare for the final push for the summit. However, the weather had been gradually deteriorating for several days, and soon a severe storm broke. At first it did not dispirit the team, and a secret ballot was held to decide which climbers should make the first summit attempt. However, as the storm continued for day after day their position became more serious. One of the tents collapsed on the fourth night, forcing Houston and Bell to <b>crowd</b> <b>into</b> other, already cramped tents. On August the 6th, with weather forecasts offering little hope of improvement, the party for the first time discussed retreating.|$|E

25|$|Not a {{trace of}} the tower or mound of the motte and bailey castle remains now. Henry II {{replaced}} it with a rectangular stone keep, which was built between 1172 and 1177 at a cost of £1,444. A stone bailey, {{in the form of a}} triangle, replaced the previous wooden one. The great outer gateway to the castle, called 'the Black Gate’, was built later, between 1247 and 1250, in the reign of Henry III. There were at that time no town walls and when attacked by the Scots, the townspeople had to <b>crowd</b> <b>into</b> the bailey for safety. It is probable that the new castle acted as a magnet for local merchants because of the safety it provided. This in turn would help to expand trade in the town. At this time wool, skins and lead were being exported, whilst alum, pepper and ginger were being imported from France and Flanders.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match was}} the triple threat {{hardcore}} match between Raven, Kane and The Big Show for the Hardcore Championship. During the match, the three wrestlers fought {{their way out}} of the ring and through the <b>crowd</b> <b>into</b> the backstage area. Big Show tried to lock himself, Raven and the referee in a security cage but Kane broke the padlock and afterwards threw Raven through a glass window. Big Show and Kane continued to brawl ending with the two throwing each other through a wall. Raven tried to escape by driving off in a golf cart, but Big Show stopped him and caused him to crash. Kane shortly followed with another golf cart, accompanied by the referee, and ran into Raven. The fight headed back into the stadium with Big Show attempting to press slam Raven off the entrance stage but both were kicked off it by Kane. Kane followed this with a diving leg drop off the stage onto Big Show, pinning him to become the new Hardcore Champion.|$|E
25|$|Their {{match at}} the 2012 Wimbledon Championships {{was one of}} the most highly {{anticipated}} Wimbledon finals in the history of The Championships. Federer was in the midst of a twenty-nine month drought in Grand Slam titles, then the longest of his career since first winning Wimbledon in 2003. Meanwhile, Murray had become the first British man to reach the Wimbledon final since Bunny Austin in 1938. Many in the United Kingdom were excited that Murray could become the first British man since Fred Perry in 1936 to win Wimbledon. Murray sent the British <b>crowd</b> <b>into</b> utopia by winning the first set (the first set he had ever won in four finals). Federer fought off four break points in the second set before employing consecutive drop volleys to win the set. The third set featured a 20-minute game at 2–2 where Federer eventually broke Murray and took command of the match. The Swiss superstar would go on to win the match in four sets. This was a historic win as it was Federer's seventh Wimbledon tying him for most ever with William Renshaw and Pete Sampras. It also was Federer's 17th major title which extended the all-time record of the most coveted achievement in the sport. The victory also saw Federer return to world No. 1 for the first time since June 2010, allowing him to break Sampras' record of 286 weeks at World no. 1.|$|E

25|$|The winning ways {{continued}} for United with three home games {{to start the}} month. In the first, United defeated the Columbus Crew 2–0, with two first half goals. The first came on a shot by Espindola that finished off a play that began with a 40-yard run by Rolfe, who got the assist on a perfectly weighted pass through the Crew defense. Espindola had the assist on the second goal with a corner kick to the far post when Sean Franklin volleyed for the goal. Back in goal for this game, Hamid earned yet another shutout. United's impressive home unbeaten streak continued a week later, with a 1–1 draw against Sporting Kansas City. A long pass from Perry Kitchen found Pontius, who chested {{the ball into the}} path of Jairo Arrieta, and Arrieta's shot found the back of the net. United gave away the lead about a minute later, just before halftime, as a cross by Sporting's Roger Espinoza found the foot of Dom Dwyer for the tying goal. Four nights later, United again defended Fortress RFK, against MLS debutantes, Orlando City SC. Missing star striker Espindola due to injury, United started slowly and Orlando capitalized as rookie Cyle Larin, the first pick in the 2015 MLS Superdraft, pounced on a loose ball in the box and beat goalie Bill Hamid. However, United was able to rally with two goals over the final 20 minutes to come away with a 2–1 win and regain the lead in the Supporters Shield race. A free kick by Taylor Kemp found the head of Opare, who was starting in place of the injured Birnbaum. Rolfe got the game-winner, stretching his leg out to get {{on the end of a}} cross by Arrieta, and tipping it in for the goal that sent the <b>crowd</b> <b>into</b> a frenzy.|$|E

The two set out to find the Blue Fairy, whom David remembers from The Adventures of Pinocchio and believes can turn him into a human, allowing Monica to love him and take him home.|$|E
500|$|The {{set list}} {{contained}} songs from Beyoncé's four studio albums {{as well as}} [...] "Jumpin', Jumpin'", which she recorded with Destiny's Child.

[...] Caryn Ganz of Spin magazine noted that Beyoncé's up-tempo songs were performed {{at the beginning of}} the concert. Fallik of The Wall Street Journal noted that the show [...] "relied too much on lesser-known, slower songs that lulled the <b>crowd</b> <b>into</b> their seats instead of bringing them to their feet" [...] and added that [...] "only a couple songs called for much movement".|$|E

500|$|In {{the next}} three years, Cousy firmly {{established}} himself {{as one of the}} league's best point guards. Leading the league in assists all 3 seasons, and averaging 20 points and 7 rebounds, the versatile Cousy earned himself three more All-NBA First Team and All-Star honors, and was also Most Valuable Player of the 1954 NBA All-Star Game. In terms of playing style, Cousy introduced an array of visually attractive street basketball moves, described by the NBA as a mix of ambidextrous, behind-the-back dribbling and [...] "no-look passes, behind-the-back feeds or half-court fastbreak launches". Cousy's modus operandi contrasted {{with the rest of the}} NBA, which was dominated by muscular low post scorers and deliberate set shooters. Soon, he was called [...] "Houdini of the Hardwood" [...] after the magician Harry Houdini. Cousy's crowd-pleasing and effective play drew the <b>crowd</b> <b>into</b> the Boston Garden and also won over coach Auerbach, who no longer saw him as a liability, but as an essential building block for the future.|$|E
500|$|Dave Zinkoff, {{the public}} address announcer, began announcing Chamberlain's point total after {{each of his}} baskets. With ten minutes {{to play in the}} game, Warriors forward Tom Meschery sensed the team concept {{breaking}} down. The team's offense had shifted to getting Chamberlain the ball and then stopping and watching instead of cutting and moving without the ball. Chamberlain needed 25points with eight minutes remaining to reach 100, a rate equivalent to 150points in a full game. He scored his 79th point with 7:51 left, breaking his own record and sending the <b>crowd</b> <b>into</b> a frenzy. The 4,124 spectators screamed, [...] "Give it to Wilt! Give it to Wilt!" [...] After he reached 80, the crowd yelled for 100. Chamberlain thought, [...] "Man, these people are tough. I'm tired. I've got 80 points and no one has ever scored 80." [...] The Warriors continued giving Chamberlain the ball. Warrior Al Attles later explained, [...] "We wanted that Wilt got the record, because we all liked him." [...] Attles himself led by example, passing up on an easy layup so that Chamberlain could score points 88 and 89, five minutes before the end.|$|E
500|$|The use of fake weapons {{generated}} controversy. After {{the concert}} in Colorado, Madonna was criticised {{over the use}} of fake weapons, since the public was sensitized by the 2012 Aurora shooting, which occurred at the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises. Peter Burns, a radio broadcaster in the region, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "You could see people kinda looking at each other. I heard the word 'Colorado', you know, 'Aurora', 'shooting'. You could hear people talking about it, and it was little bit unsettling. I saw two or three people get up and grab their stuff and actually leave their seats". Ray Mark Rinaldi from Reverb website said that Madonna was [...] "dancing with guns and shooting up bad guys during 'Revolver'. It was a bloody scene, particularly tasteless in Colorado these days, but all cartoon; if folks got upset, they were supposed to". Daniel Brokman from The Phoenix said: [...] "Madonna took the capacity <b>crowd</b> <b>into</b> a dark place that few were expecting minutes earlier from this queen of '80s pop music". In a review of the concert, Ross Raihala from Twin Cities mentioned that there was [...] "darkness hung over much {{of the first half of}} the show" [...] because of the performances of [...] "Revolver" [...] and [...] "Gang Bang." ...|$|E
