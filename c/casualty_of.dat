5000|$|During {{the pledge}} drive for <b>Casualties</b> <b>of</b> Cool, {{a number of}} {{different}} bonuses were made available to anyone that pledged a certain amount of money. One of those bonuses included a [...] "bone-shaped" [...] USB drive that contained two bonus tracks from the <b>Casualties</b> <b>of</b> Cool sessions, along with an alternate track sequence of disc 1 <b>of</b> <b>Casualties</b> <b>of</b> Cool. This also included a text document that included a message from Townsend explaining the alternate track sequence for disc 1. He explains that each track is extended with new ambiance and instrumentals that allow the newly numbered sequence to mesh more fluidly. Among these extended [...] "alternate sequence" [...] tracks is [...] "Gone Is Gone" [...] from <b>Casualties</b> <b>of</b> Cool disc 2, which was originally meant to be included in disc 1 (following [...] "Forgive Me" [...] and prefacing [...] "Broken"). However, due to the data restraints of the CD, the song was unable to make the cut. [...] "Cold Feet" [...] {{is said to be a}} by-the-numbers <b>Casualties</b> <b>of</b> Cool B-side, while [...] "Thing" [...] is reminiscent of the Ki sessions, fused with the production quality <b>of</b> <b>Casualties</b> <b>of</b> Cool. While the song explores a certain [...] "outer space" [...] ambiance relative to discs 1 and 2 <b>of</b> <b>Casualties</b> <b>of</b> Cool, it is heavier and more classic Townsend than any other <b>Casualties</b> <b>of</b> Cool song. Dorval is absent from both [...] "Cold Feet" [...] and [...] "Thing". There are also two commentary tracks included covering both discs 1 and 2, totaling out to over 2 hours of commentary. These bonuses were also included in the pledge box set.|$|R

5|$|The {{notes were}} handed to two {{horsemen}} who were standing by. The Manchester and Salford Yeomanry were stationed {{just a short}} distance away in Portland Street, and so received their note first. They immediately drew their swords and galloped towards St Peter's Field. One trooper, in a frantic attempt to catch up, knocked down a woman in Cooper Street, causing the death of her son when he was thrown from her arms; two-year-old William Fildes was the first <b>casualty</b> <b>of</b> Peterloo.|$|E
5|$|KFN was {{an early}} <b>casualty</b> <b>of</b> the {{subprime}} mortgage crisis and in September 2007, Henry Kravis and George Roberts injected $270 million into the company.

In April, KFN sold a controlling interest in a real estate subsidiary to an investment firm to raise cash and entered an agreement with the noteholders of certain secured commercial paper issued by two asset-backed entities. Following the transaction, KFN converted from a REIT to a LLC.|$|E
5|$|L'Hermite's {{force had}} {{been caught in the}} same {{hurricane}} that had dispersed Willaumez, and as a result his ships were scattered and damaged on 20 August, one frigate joining the remains of Willaumez's squadron in the United States and the others limping back to France. Most succeeded in slipping through the British blockade independently, including Régulus, which arrived at Brest on 5 October, but one ship was less successful: on 27 September 1806 the frigate Président became the final French <b>casualty</b> <b>of</b> the campaign when it was trapped in the Bay of Biscay by Louis' squadron. Closed in from all sides, the approach of Louis' flagship Canopus convinced Captain Labrosse that continued resistance was impossible and he struck his colours without a fight.|$|E

5|$|Realising {{that his}} advance {{was going to}} be contested, Bowen {{requested}} reinforcements. Consequently, as an interim measure, 59men from Warrego and Yarra were landed under Lieutenant G.A.

Meanwhile, Bowen pushed on and the Australians were again fired upon by the well concealed Germans and their Melanesian troops, as well as by snipers in the treetops.

5|$|Phoenix has {{maintained}} a growth streak in recent years, growing by 24.2% before 2007. This made it the second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, surpassed only by Las Vegas. In 2008, Squaw Peak, the second tallest mountain in the city, was renamed Piestewa Peak after Army Specialist Lori Ann Piestewa, an Arizonan and the first Native American woman to die in combat while serving in the U.S. military, {{as well as being}} the first American female <b>casualty</b> <b>of</b> the 2003 Iraq War. 2008 also saw Phoenix as one of the cities hardest hit by the subprime mortgage crisis, and by early 2009 the median home price was $150,000, down from its $262,000 peak in 2007. Crime rates in Phoenix have gone down in recent years, and once troubled, decaying neighborhoods such as South Mountain, Alhambra, and Maryvale have recovered and stabilized.

5|$|Rhys tries {{unsuccessfully to}} get Robbie O'Brien (Shaun Goss) {{to quit the}} {{surgical}} program. He then turns his attention to Erin Salisbury (Elise Jansen) and plots to take her spot on the program instead. He pursues Erin romantically and tries to distract her away from her work, so she will be kicked off the program and he can take her place. Barber said the scheme sees Rhys at his manipulative best, he realises Erin is vulnerable and he strikes. Jansen told a writer for TV Week that Erin is a bit reluctant to accept when Rhys asks her out. She thinks that someone like Rhys would not normally be interested in her, but she is flattered by the attention. Jansen added Erin is unaware it is all an act. Kate realises what Rhys is doing and interferes with his plan. Barber explained that Kate's feelings about the matter means nothing to Rhys as his sole objective is {{to get into the}} program. He does not mind that Kate is appalled at Erin becoming a <b>casualty</b> <b>of</b> his scheme.|$|E
5|$|The {{highest ranking}} <b>casualty</b> <b>of</b> this {{engagement}} was Gen. Heth, who {{was struck by}} a bullet in the head. He was apparently saved because he had stuffed wads of paper into a new hat, which was otherwise too large for his head. But there were two consequences to this glancing blow. Heth was unconscious for over 24 hours and had no further command involvement in the three-day battle. He was also unable to urge Pender's division to move forward and supplement his struggling assault. Pender was oddly passive during this phase of the battle; the typically more aggressive tendencies of a young general in Lee's army would have seen him move forward on his own accord. Hill shared the blame for failing to order him forward as well, but he claimed illness. History cannot know Pender's motivations; he was mortally wounded the next day and left no report.|$|E
5|$|At 22:56 on 5June, 1944, the six gliders towed by Halifax bombers {{took off}} from RAF Tarrant Rushton. Horsa number one, {{the first of the}} three headed for the Caen Canal, carried Howard with Lieutenant Den Brotheridge's platoon, number two bore Lieutenant David Wood's platoon, and number three carried Lieutenant Smith's platoon. Priday with Lieutenant Hooper's platoon made for the river bridge aboard number four. Horsa number five {{carrying}} Lieutenant Fox's platoon was followed by number six bearing Tod Sweeney's platoon. Each glider also carried five Royal Engineers. Flying over the English Channel at , the bombers crossed the Normandy coast at 00:07 on 6June, 1944 and released their towed gliders. With Wallwork at the controls, the number one glider crashed into the barbed wire surrounding the canal bridge defences at 00:16. The other two gliders followed at one-minute intervals. The number two glider broke in half and came to halt {{at the edge of a}} large pond. One of the men fell into the water and drowned, becoming the first <b>casualty</b> <b>of</b> the operation. Brotheridge and Smith's platoons headed for the bridge, while Wood's platoon moved towards the trenches on its north east side.|$|E
