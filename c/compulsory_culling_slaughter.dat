40|$|We {{argue that}} the {{strategy}} of culling infected dogs {{is not the most}} efficient way to control zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) and that, in the presence of alternative control strategies with better potential results, official programs of <b>compulsory</b> <b>culling</b> adopted by some countries are inefficient and unethical. We base our arguments on a mathematical model for the study of control strategies against ZVL, which allows the comparison of the efficacies of 5, alternative strategies. We demonstrate that the culling program, previously questioned on both theoretical and practical grounds is the less effective control strategy. In addition, we show that vector control and the use of insecticide-impregnated dog collars are, by far, more efficient at reducing the prevalence of ZVL in humans...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The age {{structure}} of the dog population is essential for planning and evaluating control programs for zoonotic diseases. We analyzed data of an owned-dog census in order to characterize, for the first time, {{the structure of a}} dog population under <b>compulsory</b> <b>culling</b> in a visceral leishmaniasis endemic area (Panorama, São Paulo State, Brazil) that recorded a dog-culling rate of 28 % in the year of the study. Data on 1, 329 households and 1, 671 owned dogs revealed an owned dog:human ratio of 1 : 7. The mean age of dogs was estimated at 1. 73 years; the age pyramid indicated high birth and mortality rates at the first year of age with an estimated cumulative mortality of 78 % at the third year of age and expected life span of 2. 75 years. In spite of the high mortality, a growth projection simulation suggested that the population has potential to grow in a logarithmic scale over the years. The estimated parameters can be further applied in models to maximize the impact and minimize financial inputs of visceral leishmaniasis control measures...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 This study {{expresses the}} {{hypothesis}} that historical patterns of national beef cow herd accumulation and liquidations (the cattle cycle) have been related to investment incentive differences across cow ages through time, resulting each year in changes in herd age structure, performance and potentials for adjustment in subsequent years. A review of national cattle cycle literature reveals the common assumption of variable heifer recruitment levels through time to the mature cow herd. A review of firm level cattle cycle stategy studies shows that most which considered heterogeneous herds (distinguishing performance by cow age) ironically assumed constant recruitment in proportion to cow numbers. Farmer interviews indicated that heifer recruitment may vary widely in proportion to cow numbers {{from year to year}} and that there are strong tendencies to cull non-pregnant and unsound cows from the herd at any age. The present study assumes both variable recruitment and age heterogenity. A search and synthesis of the biological literature allowed expression of economically important attributes as point estimates from continuous functions of cow age. These attributes are conception rates, health rates, cow survival rates, cull cow body weights, calf survival rates and weaning weights. Based on these biological parameters, and on the assumption that non-pregnant and unsound cows would be culled, retainment and culling rates are defined as management expectation parameters. These biological and expectation parameters are the building blocks of a simulation model designed to make value comparisons between cows of different ages and pregnancy status and to trace out changes in the national cow herd age structure through time. A budget generator produces estimates of expected net annual revenues for each of the 26 discrete age and pregnancy classes of heifers and cows, in each year from 1950 through 1978, based on exogenous price and cost series. These estimates are used to project the present values of expected future net revenues for each class of breeding animals. The ratio of future breeding value to present <b>cull</b> <b>slaughter</b> value is calculated for each of the 26 classes, each year. These V-ratios, in turn, are decision variables for determining the proportions of animals in each class to be retained in the herd, simulated by a national beef cow demography model. Annual summations from the demography model are compared with objective historical series of January 1 inventories of beef cows and replacement heifers, and annual numbers of <b>cull</b> cows <b>slaughtered</b> and beef calves born. The model's simplicity, ignoring related livestock sectors, is one of its significant features. With its few exogenous price and cost variables, simple biological relationships and management assumptions, the model is able to track the historical numbers of beef cows and calves born quite well. Mean proportional absolute deviations (MPAD) of the simulated series from the objective historical series were computed in addition to simple correlation coefficients and Theil's coefficients of inequality. In a display run, the tracking behavior of the model was best for cow inventories and calves born, and worst for heifer recruitment and cull cows, with MPAD's of. 029,. 036,. 172, and. 261, respectively. Theil's coefficients of inequality were. 405,. 587,. 962, and. 842, respectively. In an alternative run, with parameters set to reflect the assumption that all cows have the same performance characteristics across ages, the tracking behavior of the model was in several aspects about as good as the display run. Thus, the null hypothesis that performance differences across cow ages are of no importance in explaining investment behavior could not be rejected. Simulated national beef cow herd age structure changes through cattle cycles are shown from 1950 through 1978...|$|R

40|$|M. avium {{subspecies}} paratuberculosis, hereafter {{referred to}} as MAP, is a significant veterinary pathogen that causes Johne’s dis-ease in ruminants, including cattle, sheep, and goats. This chronic intestinal disease is distributed worldwide and exacts a heavy eco-nomic toll on animal producers. For example, the dairy industry incurs substantial economic losses due to reduced milk produc-tion, premature <b>culling,</b> and reduced <b>slaughter</b> value (Raizman et al., 2009). It takes years for clinical signs to appear in animals after initial infection. The bacterium is shed in high numbers in the feces during this clinical phase of disease.

40|$|Cull {{cows are}} often {{overlooked}} {{as an important}} source of income to the cow-calf enterprise. Depending upon the relationships between cull cow and calf prices, and the herd culling rate, cull cow receipts generally account for 15 - 30 percent of income from the cow-calf enterprise. However, some producers give little attention to this source of income and ways of enhancing it. For many producers, cull cows are sold at the time culling takes place, and much of this culling is done in the late fall soon after calves are weaned. Is it most profitable to sell cows when they are culled, or should they be fed for a period of time? Several factors need to be considered to properly answer that question and that is {{the purpose of this paper}} and presentation. Cows are culled from a herd for a number of reasons and the reason for culling will most likely affect the time culling takes place and could alter the most profitable marketing strategy. Reproductive failure, problems resulting from old age, and unsatisfactory performance are the most common reasons for culling an animal. While reproductive failure is generally diagnosed in the fall of the year, culling for other reasons could take place at other times. Three factors of importance regarding the decision to sell cows when culled versus feeding them and selling at a latter time are: (1) the seasonality of cull cow prices, (2) the price difference between <b>cull</b> cow <b>slaughter</b> grades and the percentage of cull cows in each grade, and (3) the cost of feeding cull cows. Each of these factors will be discussed in some detail...|$|R
40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} direct production losses (milk loss, premature voluntary <b>culling</b> and reduced <b>slaughter</b> value, mortaliy loss, and abortion and reproductive loss) and treatmetn costs (veterinary services, medication cost, and extra farm labour cost) due to four infectious diseases in the maritime provinces of Canada: bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD), enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), Johne's Disease (JD), and neosporosis. We used a partial-budget model, and incorporated risk and sensitivity analyses to identify the effects of uncertainty on costs. Total annual costs for an average, infected, 50 cow herd were: JD$ 2472; BVD$ 2421; neosporosis $ 2304; EBL$ 806. The stochastic nature of the proportion of infected herds and prevalence of infection within a herd were used to estimate probability distributions for these ex post costs. For all diseases, these distributions were right skewed. A sensitivity analysis showed the largest effect on costs was due to milk yield effects. For example, changing milk production loss from 0 to 5 % for BVD increased the costs for the disease by 266 %. LR: 20031114; PUBM: Print; JID: 8217463; ppublishSource type: Prin...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{cellular}} automata model, we simulate the British Government Policy (BGP) in the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic in Great Britain. When clinical {{symptoms of the}} disease appeared on a farm, there is mandatory <b>slaughter</b> (<b>culling)</b> of all livestock on an infected premise (IP). Those farms that neighbor an IP (contiguous premise, CP), are also culled, aka nearest neighbor interaction. Farms where the disease may be prevalent from animal, human, vehicle or airborne transmission (dangerous contact, DC), are additionally culled, aka next-to-nearest neighbor iteractions and lightning factor. The resulting mathematical model possesses a phase transition, whereupon if the physical disease transmission kernel exceeds a critical value, catastrophic loss of animals ensues. The non-local disease transport probability can be as low as. 01 % per day and the disease can {{still be in the}} high mortality phase. We show that the fundamental equation for sustainable disease transport is the criticality equation for neutron fission cascade.

This project was designed to determine whether properties infected with ovine Johne’s disease (OJD) could be identified by routine monitoring of cull sheep at abattoirs for lesions of OJD or the presence of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Trained inspectors were stationed in abattoirs to examine not less than 50 % and up to 95 % of the abdominal viscera from all lines of adult sheep slaughtered during each kill shift (about 10 to 15 lines per shift at the two major export abattoirs). Where visible lesions suggestive of OJD were observed, fixed tissue samples were taken for confirmatory histopathology from up to three suspect sheep in each suspect line. Inspectors were not told {{the identity of the}} trial lines, but were aware that there was a trial line to be killed during the particular shift. Tied-off loops of terminal ileum were also taken from 10 randomly selected sheep in each line of sheep killed during the shift for pooled intestinal culture (PIC).

The current strategy for scrapie in Great Britain requires that all genetically susceptible livestock in affected flocks be <b>culled</b> (<b>Compulsory</b> Scrapie Flock Scheme or CSFS). However, {{this results in}} the removal of many healthy sheep, and a recently developed pre-clinical test for scrapie now offers a strategy based on disease detection. We explore the flock level cost-effectiveness of scrapie control using a deterministic transmission model and industry estimates of costs associated with genotype testing, pre-clinical tests {{and the value of}} a sheep culled. Benefit was measured in terms of the {{reduction in the number of}} infected sheep sold on, compared to a baseline strategy of doing nothing, using Incremental Cost Effectiveness analysis to compare across strategies. As market data was not available for pre-clinical testing, a threshold analysis was used to set a unit-cost giving equal costs for CSFS and multiple pre-clinical testing (MT, one test each year for three consecutive years). Assuming a 40 % within-flock proportion of susceptible genotypes and a test sensitivity of 90 %, a single test (ST) was cheaper but less effective than either the CSFS or MT strategies (30 infected-sales-averted over the lifetime of the average epidemic). The MT strategy was slightly less effective than the CSFS and would be a dominated strategy unless preclinical testing was cheaper than the threshold price of (sic) 6. 28, but may be appropriate for flocks with particularly valuable livestock.

Cattle bTB reactor rates increased in DNP despite <b>compulsory</b> testing and <b>culling</b> of infected animals. In this study, 124 European wild boar, 95 red deer, and 97 fallow deer were sampled from April 2006 to April 2007 and analyzed for M. bovis infection. Modelling and GIS were used to identify risk factors and intra and inter-species relationships. Infection with M. bovis was confirmed in 65 (52. 4 %) wild boar, 26 (27. 4 %) red deer and 18 (18. 5 %) fallow deer. In the absence of cattle, wild boar M. bovis prevalence reached 92. 3 % in the northern third of DNP. Wild boar showed more than twice prevalence than that in deer (p, 0. 001). Modelling revealed that M. bovis prevalence decreased from North to South in wild boar (p, 0. 001) and red deer (p, 0. 01), whereas no spatial pattern was evidenced for fallow deer.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the role of sheep in the {{agricultural}} systems from the analysis of situations and Andean Mediterranean, characterized by a strong association between sheep farming and agriculture in the Mediterranean since antiquity, and the introduction of sheep following the Spanish colonization in the Andes. Compared to other domestic animal species in these regions as cattle or Andean camelids, sheep have several advantages (docile, small frame and able to graze difficult areas) that facilitate their livestock. However, their fragility, particularly from predators, forces farmers to collect them at night and invest {{a lot of work to}} monitor grazing and lambing. This investment was justified in work until the 19 th century by the fact that sheep produced wool, which was often the only monetary income of the family, sometimes milk for family consumption, and realized fertility transfers between space travel (saltus) and cultivated areas (ager, hortus), essential for the production of cereals and tubers, staples of these human populations. The sheep was then a byproduct of this breeding. Only older animals were <b>slaughtered</b> (<b>culls)</b> or very young (animals not kept for herd rebuilding). The opening of the world wool market in the late 19 th century signaled the end of this outlet in Western Europe, the development of artificial textiles after World War II led to the decline of the wool industry worldwide and the end of the specific function of sheep as a source of wool. The transfer function of fertility is compromised north of the Mediterranean from 1950 through the use of fertility treatments but continues to play a key role for farmers who can not afford them. Therefore, the question is: under what conditions are sheep, reduced to its function as meat production, viable...|$|R

The use of beef semen to mate cattle not destined to breed replacement represent an interesting {{source of income for}} dairy farmers particularly due to the greater price and value of crossbreed calves respect purebred calves at sale. Unfortunately this practice has been decreasing in the last years in the more specialized herds of the Po valley mainly due to fertility and longevity problems of the high productivity dairy cattle. However, on the mountain area, were farms are characterized by less productivity but high longevity and fertility of their cattle, the low replacement rate permitted each year the use of beef sire to mate a considerable number of cattle not destined to breed replacement. In the Trentino area (North of Italy) every week the breeding federation collected calves from associated dairy herds and the best of these for beef traits, following weaning at specialized farms, were fattened at local associated fattening farms. After fattening, young bulls and heifers are slaughtered at the same abattoir and the meat are sold at the central butchers and to the entire cooperative wire markets of the Province. This meat is sold with a certified mark that guarantee birth, fattening and slaughtering of the animals in the same area. Moreover, weekly, the breeding Federation of Trento province collected cull cows from associated dairy herds too and these cattle are sold to an associated abattoir. The aim of the present thesis were to study production and economic traits from the whole beef output from dairy herds in mountain area; the first contribute of the thesis analyzed production and economic traits of <b>slaughtered</b> <b>cull</b> cows while the second and the third contributes analyzed production and selling traits of calves at sale (average 24 days of age). Finally the last contribute studied production and economic traits of young bulls and heifers at slaughter respect the purchase beginning value of calf. Results of first contribute evidenced that the value of <b>cull</b> cows at <b>slaughter</b> represents a significant source of income for the dairy farm and the large differences among different breeds for cull cow value suggests its possible inclusion in the selection objectives of these breeds. Holstein-Friesian cows were younger at slaughter, yielded lighter carcasses and received a lower price and total value than Brown Swiss cows while dual purpose breeds were older, heavier and received a greater price and value at slaughter than both dairy breeds. Results from the study that analyzed calves traits had evidenced that the dual-purpose purebred calves received, on average, greater price and value at sale than purebred dairy calves. Furthermore, among crossbreed calves, the progeny from Belgian Blue sire and Simmental dam evidenced the greatest live weight and selling values. Moreover, results evidenced that the majority of purebred calves from dairy dams were most likely destined for veal production while many dual-purpose calves were most likely destined for beef production as well as the vast majority of beef crossbreed calves. Results from the final contribute evidenced that crossbred young bulls and beef heifers from Belgian Blue sires and Simmental dam achieved the highest carcass weight and the best daily gain and carcass value. The best economic revenue was achieved by Simmental bulls among purebred animals, and by Belgian Blue sire x Holstein Friesian dams, among crossbreed animals. This is mainly related to less purchase value of calves {{at the beginning of the}} fattening period.

The residues persist longer at higher doses, and a withdrawal period of 30 days is needed to ensure penicillin residue depletion in the kidney at 15, 000 IU/lb IM SID for three consecutive days. There is no evidence for environmental transfer of penicillin G residues from treated sows to untreated sows. Ampicillin trihydrate is metabolized quickly by the sow, with residues only detected in the kidney at one day following treatment. Residues persisted at high concentrations at the injection sites for 40 days following treatment {{at the conclusion of the}} study. Injection site withdrawal times were estimated at 89 days for a 12 mg/kg IM SID dose for three consecutive days. Urine and plasma are potential ante-mortem screening matrices for penicillin G or ampicillin. Environmental samples and oral fluids are not good samples for beta-lactam residue analysis. Charm MRL™ test kits are a fairly sensitive and specific urine screening method for residue detection in urine. Further research is needed to determine withdrawal times of ampicillin trihydrate in sows in edible tissues, and to evaluate the efficacy of alternative screening methods. Available research describes a metabolism of procaine penicillin G and ampicillin trihydrate based on absorption, which is rapid once drug enters circulation. Original research supports this, but shows an extended residue of both drugs at injection sites following treatment. This information may be applied to establish recommendations for withdrawal times on extra-label beta-lactams and used clinically as a guide for the protection of meat from violative residues entering the consumer supply...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research on}} the dynamics and control of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV) in the pig population of Great Britain (GB). The roles of the metapopulation of pig herds (metaherd) and individual herd characteristics are examined, and different control and intervention strategies assessed. A novel stochastic model of a metaherd was created, incorporating the births, deaths, <b>slaughter,</b> <b>culls</b> and movement of pigs within and between herds. The metaherd was structured to have characteristics representative of the GB metaherd: the distribution of herd sizes, ‘source’ herds per herd, and numbers of pigs moved per movement. The metaherd was arranged into a typical pyramidal structure. A stochastic infectious process of PRRSV was included. Herd size {{was found to be}} key to within herd persistence of PRRSV, with infection failing to persist in smaller (250 sow) herds. Fadeout did not occur in larger herds once infection established in the rearing herd. PRRSV reduces productivity of herds and the metaherd. There was variability in productivity both between herds and within herds over time. The number of source herds did not influence the dynamics, persistence or prevalence of infection within a herd. Breeding herd production was further decreased by PRRSV when the herd also had a rearing herd (breeder finisher). The model was extended to test the effects of control and intervention strategies. Vaccination effect increased with herd size, and reduced variability in production. Vaccination in small herds was ineffective in increasing production due to PRRSV failing to persist regardless of vaccination. Vaccination of the breeding herd produced higher gains per vaccine dose than vaccination of the rearing herd only. Vaccination of the rearing herd only resulted in higher total herd and metaherd gains, with less variability. Partial de-population combined with vaccination increased the probability of increasing herd performance unless the herd was small (1000 sows). Results highlighted the value of modelling to support the decisions of individual farmers to vaccinate and partially depopulate, showing that the optimal decision is influenced by the herd size. Results also demonstrated that the decision to introduce interventions is different for individual farmers...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine/PathobiologyDaniel U. ThomsonA {{series of}} studies were {{conducted}} in order to develop, test, implement, and utilize an objective and comprehensive gross pathology scoring system for cattle at slaughter. Individual lung, liver, and rumen gross pathology data was collected from 19, 229 head of cattle and corresponding individual pre-harvest and carcass data for a subset of 13, 226 head [...] Across the entire population 22. 6 % and 9. 8 % of cattle displayed mild and severe lesions, respectively. Severe lung lesions {{at the time of}} slaughter were associated with a decreased ADG of 0. 07 kg/ day and a carcass weight 7. 1 kg less than that of their cohorts with no visible signs of pulmonary BRDC lesions (P < 0. 01). Overall, 68. 6 % of cattle observed had normal livers, free from abscesses and other abnormalities. Cattle with a severe liver abscess at the time of slaughter were associated with a 0. 10 kg/day during the feeding period (P < 0. 01). Of cattle severely affected by liver abscesses (A+, 4. 6 %), 14. 9 % also displayed severe BRDC lung lesions and 28. 3 % of cattle displayed mild BRDC lung lesions. Rumenitis lesions were observed in 24. 1 % of the overall study population. Severe rumenitis lesions were associated with a significant decrease in average daily gain and carcass weight (0. 03 kg/day and 2. 20 kg, respectively, P < 0. 01). The system was also implemented on a population of cull cows at a commercial abattoir in the Great Lakes region of the U. S. (n= 1, 461; 87 % Holstein, 13 % other cows). Severe liver abscesses, were observed in 18. 5 % of <b>cull</b> cows at <b>slaughter.</b> Severe rumenitis lesions or rumenitis scars were observed in 10 % and severe BRDC lesions were observed in 10. 3 % o of the population. A prospective study of a commercially available, direct fed microbial oral drench of Megasphaera elsdenii (NCIMB 41125) was conducted in 4, 863 head of yearling feeder cattle. No significant effects of treatment were detected for final live weight (599 vs. 601 kg; P= 0. 79) or hot carcass weight (386 vs. 387 kg P= 0. 81) for Con and M. e., respectively. Fourteen point two percent and 14. 0 % of Con and M. e., respectively displayed a liver abscess of varying severity at the time of slaughter. Overall, 8. 27 and 7. 96 % % of Con and M. e. cattle were observed with an altered rumen epithelial health status. The ordinal odds ratio of a M. e. treated animal having a more severe liver abscess score or rumen health score was not significant (Estimate: 0. 96, 95 % C. L. 0. 733 - 1. 259, P= 0. 771; Estimate: 1. 01, 95 % C. L. 0. 625 - 1. 63 P= 0. 96, respectively.) Comprehensive monitoring of gross pathology at slaughter is commercially plausible and provides valuable data for veterinarians, nutritionists and management personnel...|$|R
