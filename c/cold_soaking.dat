This study was motivated by the need to assess risks associated with incorporating acoustic testing capability in wind tunnels with semicryogenic high Reynolds number aerodynamic and/or low pressure capabilities. The study consisted of three phases: 1) measurement of acoustic properties of selected liner materials at subatmospheric pressure conditions, 2) periodic <b>cold</b> <b>soak</b> and high pressure exposure of liner materials for 250 cycles, and 3) determination of the effect of periodic <b>cold</b> <b>soak</b> on the acoustic properties of the liner materials at subatmospheric conditions and the effect on mechanical resiliency. The selected liner materials were Pyrell foam, Fiberglass, and Kevlar. A vacuum facility was used to create the subatmospheric environment in which an impedance tube was placed to measure acoustic properties of the test materials. An automated cryogenic cooling system was used to simulate periodic <b>cold</b> <b>soak</b> and high pressure exposure. It was found that lower ambient pressure reduced the absorption effectiveness of the liner materials to varying degrees. Also no significant change in the acoustic properties occurred after the periodic <b>cold</b> <b>soak.</b> Furthermore, mechanical resiliency tests indicated no noticeable change...|$|R

40|$|Rice {{production}} {{is a key}} component in the Sri Lankan economy. Paddy is processed to produce raw or parboiled rice. In parboiling process, <b>cold</b> <b>soaking</b> uses about 1, 300 liters of water per tonne of paddy. About 70 % of the water used in parboiling with biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) ranging from 950 to 1300 mg/L is discharged as effluent into the surface waters, causing environmental damage. Anaerobic condition in the <b>cold</b> <b>soaking</b> process is considered {{the primary reason for}} high BOD of the effluent. Maintaining aerobic conditions would reduce the effluent strength. Study of dissolved oxygen (DO) profile, in the soaking water, is important in the design of an aerobic <b>cold</b> <b>soaking</b> system. An experiment was conducted to study the DO profile in conventional and aerated soaking processes using 12 month old small grain paddy. Soaking tests were 48 hour duration and DO concentration was measured intermittently. When DO reduced to about 1. 0 mg/L, water was aerated by circulation through a shower, Aeration was stopped when increased to about 8 mg/L. This cycle was repeated for 48 hours. Moisture content of paddy, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and pH of effluent were measured during the experiment. Initially, it took about 9 hours of soaking for DO to deplete to lower limit and aeration to upper limit took only 25 minutes. As the experiment progressed time for DO depletion decreased and time for aeration increased. After about 21 hours, the depletion-aeration cycle stabilized at about 3 hour total cycle time.

40|$|CD-ROM included; A thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Chemical and Process Engineering for the MSc in Chemical and Process EngineeringParboiling is a widely used paddy processing method where paddy is soaked in water to hydrate before the subsequent steaming, drying and milling operations. A significant amount of water is used in this soaking operation which is then discharged as wastewater. The continuous discharge of this wastewater has become an environmental concern in the paddy parboiling industry in Sri Lanka. In this study important characteristics of the effluent generated from two existing paddy soaking operations practiced in Sri Lanka namely hot soaking and <b>cold</b> <b>soaking</b> were initially determined. This analysis was done for wastewater resulting from soaking two rice varieties available locally, namely LD 356 a red rice and BG 300 which is a white rice. Characterization study showed pollutant levels higher in paddy soak wastewater than the stipulated local discharge standards (Appendix C). Wastewater generated from both hot soaking and <b>cold</b> <b>soaking</b> of red rice variety showed relatively higher COD and BOD values compared to those of wastewater from white rice variety. Hot soaking wastewater had higher COD and BOD values than <b>cold</b> <b>soaking</b> wastewater. The wastewater generated from hot soaking of red rice which showed higher pollutant strength is further studied for pollutant removalmethods. Biological treatment methods such as aerobic, anaerobic and physical treatment methods such as coagulation and adsorption were investigated. Removal of pollutants by aquatic plants and biological treatment using various microbial seeding sources such as cow dung, rice straw, pond water and paddy field soil were also studied. Results show that microbial sources from pond water and paddy field soil were able to reduce COD in soak wastewater by 96 % and 94 % respectively at pH 8 under aerobic and dark conditions. Combined treatment of anaerobic digestion and coagulation was able to reduce 94 % COD while the combination of adsorption and coagulation reduced COD by 92 %.

40|$|Rice is {{the most}} popular food in Sri Lanka where {{approximately}} 70 % of the paddy production goes through the parboiling process. Parboiling process is a hydrothermal treatment method. This treatment process consumes energy, water and other environmental resources and adds air and solid emissions, effluents and wastages back to environment which cause adverse environmental impacts. Total environmental input and output emissions of the parboiling process depend on the selected treatment method and the type of equipment used. Therefore the total environmental effects of each and every step in the life cycle of the production process needs to be considered in order to identify the most environmental friendly paddy parboiling method. The overall objective of this work is to assess environmental impacts of different parboiled paddy production methods adopted in Sri Lanka by using life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. LCA is a methodological context to estimate the environmental effects caused by the life cycle of a product, service or process. Goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory analysis, life cycle impact assessment and interpretation are the four major steps in LCA methodology. The environmental performance of three parboiling methods named as modern method with hot soaking and mechanical drying, modern method with hot soaking and sun drying and semi modern method with <b>cold</b> <b>soaking</b> and sun drying were assessed and compared quantitatively and qualitatively. Processes from paddy harvesting to rice cooking are included in the system boundary. According to the results, highest impact of parboiled rice production is given by the cooking step.
