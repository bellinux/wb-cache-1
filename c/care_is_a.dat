5|$|Continuous <b>Care</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> service {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day. Because the criteria for continuous care is similar to general inpatient care, and due to the challenges a hospice can face with staffing extended day care in the home, continuous care {{is intended to be}} used for short periods of time.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> crucial part of healthcare in developing countries, {{and it may be}} difficult to budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E

25|$|In many {{healthcare}} systems, prolonged ventilation as part {{of intensive}} <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> limited resource (in {{that there are only}} so many patients that can receive care at any given moment). It is used to support a single failing organ system (the lungs) and cannot reverse any underlying disease process (such as terminal cancer). For this reason, there can be (occasionally difficult) decisions to be made about whether it is suitable to commence someone on mechanical ventilation. Equally many ethical issues surround the decision to discontinue mechanical ventilation.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, health <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{responsibility}} of the provinces. In the province of Ontario, the price of hearing aids is partially reimbursed through the Assistive Devices Program of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, up to $500 for each hearing aid. Like eye appointments, audiological appointments are no longer covered through the provincial public health plan. Audiometric testing can still easily be obtained, often free of charge, in private sector hearing aid clinics and some ear, nose and throat doctors offices. Hearing aids may be covered to some extent by private insurance {{or in some cases}} through government programs such as Veterans Affairs Canada or Workplace Safety & Insurance Board.|$|E

25|$|This breed {{requires}} expert veterinary {{attention in}} areas such as birthing and dental care. Dental <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> must for these small dogs, whose jaw size makes for weaker teeth. Although daily brushing provides the best preventative measure, feeding a dental diet or using dental chews for dogs is an effective approach pet owners can take to help prevent and control accumulation of plaque and tartar to avoid consequences of severe periodontal disease. The best physical characteristics of dog food to contribute to cleaning a dog's teeth would be food that is large and dense, that way there is more time spent chewing which leads {{to the surface of the}} teeth being cleaned.|$|E
25|$|The Pauline and Stanley Foster Pavilion for Cancer <b>Care</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 108-bed {{facility}} {{affiliated with}} Moores Cancer Center and {{dedicated to the}} treatment of advanced cancers.

Patients will have access to over 100 cancer subspecialists working at Moores Cancer Center. The sixth floor of the hospital, jointly operated with Sharp HealthCare, is the only open floor in California with full-unit air filtration, allowing blood and marrow transplant patients and those undergoing chemotherapy to socialize and roam throughout the floor. Procedures such as laser ablation of brain tumors are handled downstairs in the Vassiliadis Pavilion.|$|E
25|$|Hospice <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> type of {{care and}} {{philosophy}} of care {{that focuses on the}} palliation of a chronically ill, terminally ill or seriously ill patient's pain and symptoms, and attending to their emotional and spiritual needs. In Western society, the concept of hospice has been evolving in Europe since the 11th century. Then, and for centuries thereafter in Roman Catholic tradition, hospices were places of hospitality for the sick, wounded, or dying, as well as those for travelers and pilgrims. The modern concept of hospice includes palliative care for the incurably ill given in such institutions as hospitals or nursing homes, but also care provided to those who would rather spend their last months and days of life in their own homes. The first modern hospice care was created by Cicely Saunders in 1967.|$|E

Though he voted for the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act that created the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, nearly a decade later Ryan said Medicare is on an [...] "unsustainable path".|$|E
500|$|Andrews found Cardozo's {{reasoning}} too narrow, {{and felt}} that the focus {{should be on the}} unreasonable act: driving down Broadway at high speed is negligent whether or not an accident occurs. Such an act is wrong to the public at large, not only to those who might be injured. [...] "Due <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> duty imposed on each one of us to protect society from unnecessary danger, not to protect A, B or C alone... In an empty world, negligence would not exist. It does involve a relationship between man and his fellows. But not merely a relationship between man and those whom he might reasonably expect his act would injure. Rather, a relationship between him and those whom he does in fact injure. If his act has a tendency to harm some one, it harms him a mile away as surely as it does those on the scene." ...|$|E
