5|$|Lettuce {{appears in}} many medieval writings, {{especially}} as a medicinal herb. Hildegard of Bingen mentioned {{it in her}} writings on medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179, and many early herbals also describe its uses. In 1586, Joachim Camerarius provided descriptions of the three basic modern lettuces– head lettuce, loose-leaf <b>lettuce,</b> and <b>romaine</b> (<b>or</b> <b>cos)</b> <b>lettuce.</b> Lettuce was first brought to the Americas from Europe by Christopher Columbus in the late 15th century. Between the late 16th century and the early 18th century, many varieties were developed in Europe, particularly Holland. Books published in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries describe several varieties found in gardens today.|$|R
30|$|Nile Tilapia and <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> {{can grow}} well {{together}} in aquaponic {{system in this}} study. <b>Romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> growth in T 2 (nile tilapia and <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce)</b> and T 3 (nile tilapia. <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce,</b> and addition of bacteria) was well recorded by color of fresh green leaves, {{and there were no}} signs of nutritional deficiency. <b>Romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> could utilize nutrient originating from fish culture. This nutrient was a result of decomposition of fish excreta and uneaten food. Best growth of nile tilapia was shown by T 3 in terms of FCR, proportional to better water quality in this treatment. Thus, <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> could, to some extent, purify water quality of fish culture media to be reused in the fish culture. Aquaponic system (nile tilapia and <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce)</b> without water exchange can maintain the quality of the water suitable for fish and plant growth, without having to replace the water regularly like in conventional cultivation system. Further research on optimization of the number of plant incorporated in fish culture in aquaponic system is required.|$|R

30|$|<b>Romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> {{growth in}} terms of DGR and RGR between T 2 and T 3 has no {{significant}} difference (p >  0.05) (Table  3). <b>Romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> growth indicated the absorption of nutrients during the experiment. When plants are growing quickly, nutrient needs are high, and nutrient uptake will be greater (Buzby and Lin 2014). Lennard and Leonard (2006) research results also showed that lettuce grown in gravel as hydroponic media was efficient at removing nutrients. The RGR of <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> in this study (0.30 – 0.035) {{is better than the}} result of research by Buzby and Lin (2014), where RGR of lettuce on aquaponic system at the end of experiment only reached 0.01. Similarly, <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> growth {{in terms of}} DGR in this study is higher than result of Effendi et al. (2015 b) namely 0.04  cm/day, and lower than the research by Endut et al. (2011) namely 1.91  cm/day (water spinach) and 1.32  cm/day (mustard green).|$|R
30|$|In the {{recirculation}} aquaponic system (RAS), {{fish farming}} waste was utilized as a nutrient for plant, minimizing the water need, reducing the waste disposal into the environment, and producing {{the fish and}} plant as well. The study aimed to examine the growth of <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Lactuca sativa L. var. Longifolia) in aquaponic system without the addition of artificial nutrient. The nutrient relies solely on wastewater of nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) cultivation circulated continuously on the aquaponic system. The results showed that tilapia weight reached 48.49  ±  3.92  g of T 3 (tilapia, <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce,</b> and inoculated bacteria), followed by T 2 (tilapia and <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce)</b> and T 1 (tilapia) of 47.80  ±  1.97 and 45.89  ±  1.10  g after 35  days of experiment. Tilapia best performance in terms of growth and production occurred at T 3 of 3.96  ±  0.44  g/day, 12.10  ±  0.63  %/day, 96.11  ±  1.44  % and 1.60  ±  0.07 for GR, SGR, SR, and FCR, respectively. It is also indicated by better water quality characteristic in this treatment. <b>Romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> harvests of T 2 and T 3 showed no significant difference, with the final weight of 61.87  ±  5.59 and 57.74  ±  4.35  g. Overall, the integration of tilapia fish farming and <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> is potentially a promising aquaponic system for sustainable fish and horticulture plant production.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O 157 :H 7 is {{the causal}} agent {{for more than}} 96, 000 cases of diarrheal illness and 3, 200 infection-attributable hospitalizations {{annually}} in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We defined a confirmed case as a compatible illness in a person with the outbreak strain during 10 / 07 / 2011 - 11 / 30 / 2011. Investigation included hypothesis generation, a case-control study utilizing geographically-matched controls, and a case series investigation. Environmental inspections and tracebacks were conducted. RESULTS: We identified 58 cases in 10 states; 67 % were hospitalized and 6. 4 % developed hemolytic uremic syndrome. Any romaine consumption {{was significantly associated with}} illness (matched Odds Ratio (mOR) = 10. 0, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) = 2. 1 - 97. 0). Grocery Store Chain A salad bar was significantly associated with illness (mOR = 18. 9, 95 % CI = 4. 5 - 176. 8). Two separate traceback investigations for <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> converged on Farm A. Case series results indicate that cases (64. 9 %) were more likely than the FoodNet population (47 %) to eat <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> (p-value = 0. 013); 61. 3 % of cases reported consuming <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> from the Grocery Store Chain A salad bar. CONCLUSIONS: This multistate outbreak of STEC O 157 :H 7 infections was associated with consumption of <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce.</b> Traceback analysis determined that a single common lot of <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> harvested from Farm A was used to supply Grocery Store Chain A and a university campus linked to a case with the outbreak strain. An investigation at Farm A did not identify the source of contamination. Improved ability to trace produce from the growing fields to the point of consumption will allow more timely prevention and control measures to be implemented...|$|R

The organic leafy greens were thoroughly washed and inoculated with a three-strain cocktail of E. coli O 157 :H 7 (6 log CFU ml- 1). Antimicrobial treatments of the extracts, prepared in phosphate buffered saline, at 1, 3, and 5 % concentrations {{were used to}} wash contaminated leafy greens which were then stored for 3 days at 4 ºC. Surviving E. coli O 157 :H 7 populations were enumerated on days 0, 1, and 3 of storage. Significant reductions (P< 0. 05) in pathogen populations were observed in all the leafy greens following treatment with the plant extracts. Between 2. 9 - 5. 3 log CFUg- 1 reductions in E. coli O 157 :H 7 population were observed with all three concentrations (1 %, 3 % and 5 %) of olive extract by day 3, for all the leafy greens.

40|$|Noroviruses (NoV) {{annually}} cause {{millions of}} cases of gastrointestinal disease in the United States. NoV are associated with raw shellfish outbreaks, particularly oysters, which are thought to bioaccumulate NoV particles during the filter-feeding process. NoV outbreaks, however, have also been known to occur from other common-source food-borne vehicles, such as lettuce, frozen raspberries, and salad. In this study, we evaluated <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> as a potential vehicle for NoV transmission by testing the binding and distribution of NoV {{to the surface of}} romaine. Recombinant Norwalk virus-like particles (rNVLP) applied to the surface of <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> localized as large clusters primarily on the leaf veins. An extract of <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> leaves in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (romaine extract [RE]) bound rNVLP in a dose-dependent manner. RE did not bind rNVLP by histo-blood group antigens (HBGA), nor was RE competitive with rNVLP binding to porcine gastric mucin. These results suggested that non-HBGA molecules in RE bind rNVLP by a binding site(s) that is different from the defined binding pocket on the virion. Extracts of cilantro, iceberg lettuce, spinach, and celery also bound rNVLP. Samples of each of the vegetables spiked with rNVLP and tested with anti-NVLP antibody revealed by confocal microscopy the presence of rNVLP not only on the veins of cilantro but also throughout the surface of iceberg lettuce...|$|R

40|$|Increase in {{consumption}} of fresh cut produce {{over the past}} decade has resulted in a rise in incidents of food borne outbreaks due to pathogens. Conventional techniques of sanitizing washes may not be effective since the organic matter released from the fresh produce use up the free chlorine thus reducing the sanitizing potential of wash water just when it is needed most and a heat treatment step to kill pathogens cannot be applied if the purpose is to consume fresh produce. Electron beam (e-beam) irradiation was used to treat cut cantaloupe, cut roma tomatoes, baby spinach, <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> which were surface inoculated with a cocktail of Salmonella and E. coli O 157 :H 7. Results showed that irradiation reduced Salmonella and E. coli O 157 :H 7 significantly with increasing doses at 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, and 1. 0 kGy. The D 10 -value for Salmonella on irradiated cut cantaloupe, cut roma tomatoes, baby spinach, and <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> was found to be 0. 71 kGy, 0. 64 kGy, 0. 19 kGy, and 0. 23 kGy respectively. The D 10 -value for E. coli O 157 :H 7 on the produce listed above was found to be 0. 73 kGy, 0. 54 kGy, 0. 18 kGy, and 0. 20 kGy respectively. Low dose e-beam irradiation was found to be an excellent tool for ensuring the reduction of spoilage organisms and extending shelf life in cut cantaloupe, cut roma tomatoes, baby spinach, <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce,</b> strawberries, and green onion. The produce were tested for 12 days of storage for aerobic plate count, yeast and mold, lactic bacteria, color, texture, and respiration rate as a function of irradiation doses 0, 1, 3, and 5 kGy. Aerobic plate counts, yeast counts, and lactic acid bacteria were reduced appreciably at all doses tested on all commodities. Molds did not grow on any samples including control for cut cantaloupe, cut tomatoes, and green onion but for the other commodities, mold was reduced {{at the same rate as}} yeasts and vegetative bacteria. Lactic acid bacteria were reduced at all doses while the reduction was highest with 5 kGy in all commodities. When irradiated with 5 kGy, during storage, strawberries, spinach, and green onion displayed wet, soggy and mushy appearance, <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce</b> leaves were wilted, had a translucent midrib and brown pigmentation. E-beam irradiation increased respiration rate for all samples on day 0 compared to non-irradiated control irrespective of the commodity type and the effect was dose dependent. Firmness reduced appreciably for cut roma tomatoes, baby spinach, strawberries, <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce,</b> and green onion with increasing doses. Cut cantaloupe was low in firmness but the effect was not dose dependent. Irradiation at low doses is a promising tool to reduce pathogens and enhance keeping quality of cut cantaloupe, cut tomatoes, baby spinach, <b>romaine</b> <b>lettuce,</b> strawberries, and green onion. Irradiation is to be implemented as part of an overall HACCP plan and is not meant to replace existing control measures...|$|R
