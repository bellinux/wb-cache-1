5000|$|Cloth of gold or {{gold cloth}} is a fabric woven with a gold-wrapped or spun weft—referred to as [...] "a spirally spun gold strip". In most cases, the <b>core</b> <b>yarn</b> is silk wrapped (filé) {{with a band}} or strip of high content gold. In rarer instances, fine linen and wool {{have been used as}} the core.|$|E
50|$|Zari is {{basically}} a brocade of tinsel thread meant for weaving and embroidery. It is manufactured by winding or wrapping (covering) a flattened metallic strip made from pure gold, silver or slitted metallised polyester film, on a <b>core</b> <b>yarn,</b> usually of pure silk, viscose, cotton, nylon, polyester, P.P., mono/multi filament, wire, etc. Nowadays, it can broadly be divided into three types. Real zari, imitation zari, and metallic zari.|$|E
50|$|In machine {{spinning}} bouclé can {{be created}} in a single step, using a hollow spindle. It is made by differing the feed rate of the effect yarn {{with respect to the}} <b>core</b> <b>yarns.</b> The <b>core</b> <b>yarns</b> are wrapped around the effect yarn either loosely or tightly, depending on the difference in feed rates and amount of twist used. The regularity of the loops is controlled by varying the distance between the point where the <b>core</b> <b>yarns</b> come together and the guide.

50|$|Strategic analysis:1. The {{group has}} a unique {{business}} model with presence in entire value chain from Fibre to Fabric this gives it the company the flexibility to reorganize their business effectively during down turns and ramp up faster than competitors {{when the economy is}} buoyant.2. The group has a large cotton inventory holding capacity thus helping it to control its supply chain operations and thereby absorb fluctuations in market demand.3. In order to build a competitive advantage, the group has been continuously working on improving its capabilities continuously and diversifying from its <b>core</b> <b>Yarn</b> and fabric business.

50|$|The inactivated {{specification}} {{describes the}} requirements for the manufacture of compliant cords. The fibers for the outer sheath must be colored using an approved dye; the dye cannot compromise {{the structure of the}} fibers or the finished product. The undyed fibers are twisted tightly to make the inner yarns—3 bundles of fiber per <b>core</b> <b>yarn.</b> The sheath is then plaited over the yarns. The number of yarns are determined by cord type; type III would have 7-9 yarns. The cord is steamed to tighten the cord. This step is crucial for parachute use since the extra bit of stretch helps absorb the shock when the parachute is deployed.|$|E
30|$|There were Persian velvets {{in which}} the metal threads had pink core yarns. Also there were two <b>core</b> <b>yarn</b> samples of an Indian velvet whose current colors are yellow but from which Ct {{components}} (markers of safflower) [44] were detected (Figure  7 B, acc. no. 1983.494. 7 b yellow <b>core</b> <b>yarn</b> of metal thread, as an example). This may suggest that the original color of the <b>core</b> <b>yarn</b> of the metal thread might have been pink. They were all dyed {{with a combination of}} safflower and turmeric (Figures  6 A and 7 A, and B). Turmeric, a characteristic of Indian production, was used for the pink <b>core</b> <b>yarn</b> in both Persian and Indian velvets.|$|E
40|$|Owing {{to growing}} demand for {{comfortable}} clothes, elastane filament yarns are being used in fabrics for several garments. In this study, <b>core</b> spun <b>yarns</b> were produced with cotton fibres and PBT/elastane filament yarns (cotton as sheath material, PBT yarn and elastane as <b>core</b> <b>yarns).</b> Twill woven (1 / 3 Z) fabrics were produced by using <b>core</b> spun <b>yarns</b> (30 tex) and cotton yarns (30 tex) as weft, and 100 % cotton yarn (59 tex) as warp yarns. The fabrics consisting of PBT were washed at 100 °C for 30 minutes to gain the elasticity. The woven fabrics’ weight, thickness, elongation, permanent elongation, dimensional stability, air permeability, thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity characteristics were tested and statistically evaluated. According to the results, the fabrics containing PBT and elastane filaments had similar elongation and shrinkage values. PBT filament yarns have a great potential to produce lightweight elastic fabrics...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the <b>core</b> spun <b>yarn</b> used to impart {{elasticity}} to fabrics and their usage {{has recently been}} increasing. Most significantly, {{in the production of}} denim fabrics when the <b>core</b> spun <b>yarn</b> and the paper yarn are used properly as weft, it is found that the disadvantages of the paper denim fabric’s heaviness, roughness, and wrinkles caused by low stretchability, can be greatly improved.|$|R
30|$|The three Persian velvets and two Indian velvets had <b>core</b> <b>yarns</b> {{of metal}} thread that {{appeared}} to be dyed with the same type of dye: a combination of safflower and turmeric. Although the dye used on both sets of metal thread is the same, the metal composition of the two cultural types follows a similar tendency as was observed by the metal thread analyses. The metal composition of the Indian velvet metal thread consisted of nearly pure silver, but that of the Persian velvet metal thread was slightly less pure, containing some additional copper.|$|R

40|$|In this research, bamboo charcoal/spandex (BC/S) complex yarn was {{fabricated}} using spandex as the <b>core</b> <b>yarn,</b> {{which was}} then wrapped with bamboo charcoal nylon textured yarn. The <b>core</b> <b>yarn</b> was first expanded and then wrapped with the wrapping yarn on a ro-tor twister machine at speeds of 4000, 6000, 8000, 10000, and 12000 r. p. m. The wrapping amount of the BC/S complex yarns were 2, 3, and 4 turns/cm. In order to evaluate the physical properties of the BC/S complex yarn, the maximum breaking strength, elongation, and elas-tic recovery rate were tested. We fabricated BC/S fabrics using circular knitting based on optimal manufacturing parameters. The BC/S complex yarn had an optimum elastic recov-ery rate of 98. 89 % when the rotor speed was 10000 r. p. m and the wrap number 4 turns/cm.

30|$|Another fire {{blocking}} technology uses <b>core</b> spun <b>yarn</b> {{to produce}} barrier materials. <b>Core</b> spun <b>yarn</b> (also known as core-sheath yarn) {{begins with an}} inherently fire resistant fiber core (e.g., glass). This core is then coated with a less expensive material (e.g., polyester) that is primarily responsible for the aesthetic and comfort properties. The thermally stable core maintains the structural integrity and provides a woven framework (grid) for the char layer (lattice) formed by the thermal decomposition of the sheath fiber. This type of “grid/lattice” structure ([[URL] 2999]) provides the physical barrier that prevents flame penetration into the more flammable cushioning layer as discussed earlier. The composition of the core and sheath can be tailored to satisfy fabric performance requirements. For example, to further improve fire resistance the sheath layer may contain FR, and to improve strength and durability a polyester or polyamide sheath may be used instead of a cotton or polypropylene. Beside barrier fabrics, the <b>core</b> spun <b>yarn</b> may {{also be used as}} sewing thread in upholstery.|$|R
30|$|In general, {{yarn count}} of the weft for {{commonly}} used cotton denim fabrics in summer and winter are respectively about 15 and 10  Ne. Taking this into consideration when calculating the count of final Hanji combination yarn, a single paper yarn {{count of the}} summer and winter usage is appropriate with the count of 30 and 15  Ne respectively based on the <b>core</b> spun <b>yarns</b> 30  Ne. Thus, when weaving with the paper <b>yarn</b> and the <b>core</b> spun <b>yarn</b> in the weaving process, according to the season, it is also advised to select each weft yarn within a similar yarn count range compared to the preferred cotton yarn count.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to produce hollow yarn knitted fabrics with improved thermal comfort properties. Thermal comfort properties and utility properties determine the wearing comfort of textiles and the suitability of a new textile product for a particular application. Both, Thermal comfort properties such as thermal absorptiveness, thermal conductivity, air permeability and utility properties like percent stretch, spirality, bursting strength of <b>core</b> <b>yarn</b> knitted fabrics and hollow yarn knitted fabrics were assessed. A new method was proposed and discussed for producing hollow yarns at fabric stage (in this case knitted fabric) which involved the following steps: - a) Production of ring spun yarns, comprising nylon as a core and cotton as a sheath, using Ring Spinning System. b) Production of knitted fabrics of different knit structures viz., single jersey, rib and interlock using above mentioned yarn. c) Dissolution of core element i. e. Nylon into formic acid to obtain hollow yarn knitted fabrics and this hollow yarn knitted fabrics can be tailored for specific end use.

30|$|Therefore, in this study, {{we aim to}} {{manufacture}} the Hanji denim fabric by using either of these two yarn types for the weft: of the Hanji combination yarn (combined Hanji paper <b>yarn</b> with <b>core</b> spun <b>yarn)</b> or by inserting the Hanji paper <b>yarn</b> and the <b>core</b> spun <b>yarn</b> in a 1 : 1 ratio. In the warp, we plan to use two kinds of existing yarns dyed with a chemical indigo dyestuff and a natural indigo dyestuff (blue color).

30|$|With {{regard to}} the {{physical}} properties of yarns, the breaking stress of Hanji paper yarn was {{lower than those of}} the cotton <b>yarn</b> and the <b>core</b> spun <b>yarn,</b> but the paper yarn maintained a relatively high breaking strain. The Hanji combination yarn has been improved the weaving ability by complementing the tensile strength of Hanji paper yarn. In the surface structure of the yarn, the rope-dyed cotton yarn showed a rather bulky structure while the cheese-dyed cotton yarn showed a compact structure. The structure of Hanji combination yarns showed that the Hanji single <b>yarn</b> and <b>core</b> spun <b>yarn</b> were tightly combined resulting in a stable form. The optimal weft inserting speed for the Hanji paper yarn was approximately 90 % of the cotton yarn with the same yarn count. Also, the appearance of most Hanji denim fabrics produced showed no significant difference from the existing stretchable denim fabrics indicating commercialization of Hanji denim fabrics as highly possible.|$|R
40|$|In this work, a {{spinning}} metal wire collector {{was employed to}} continuously collect polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers produced by a disc fiber generator and coil them around a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) yarn. The obtained composite yarns exhibited a core/shell structure (PET yarn/PAN nanofibers) with nanofibers orderly arranged {{on the surface of}} the PET yarn. The electric field analysis showed that the position of metal wire had insignificant effect on the formed electric field and high intensity electric field was formed at the disc circumferential area, which provided a constant electric field for the production of uniform nanofibers. The spinning solution, spinning speed of metal wire, and winding speed were found to play an important role in producing good quality nanofiber yarns, in terms of morphology, strength, and productivity. Pure nanofiber yarns were obtained after dissolving the <b>core</b> <b>yarns</b> in a proper solvent.

The study was made on cotton covered/nylon filament <b>core</b> <b>yarn</b> of 25 tex linear density produced at different twists. The load-extension curves showed three types ofbreakages. At low twist, the fibers slip along the filament core and mainly the filament yarn supports the effort. The breakage of this nature was named high elongation breakage. At medium twist, the sheath destroys first, and then the core filament breakage occurs too. The breakage of this nature was named structural breakage. At high twists, a simultaneous breakage of cotton fibers and nylon multifilament occurs...|$|E
