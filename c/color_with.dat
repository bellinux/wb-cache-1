Reinforcements will join the side of whoever last visit Gate Rooms. If no one entered a Gate Room before the man-at-arms appears, they will join the King's Guard.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats {{are covered}} with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or black in <b>color,</b> <b>with</b> the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the age increases, it turns a partly gray in color. The fur has two layers, which helps {{protect them from the}} cold water. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are {{slightly}} flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique to them. When they walk on land, their tails drag on the ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize.|$|E
5|$|Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{has a small}} (an {{average of}} 20.9mm in length in adult individuals), delicate, ovate shell of 3¼ whorls, with deep sutures. The shell is almost translucent, and varies in color from a chalky pale yellow to white, with a glossy surface. Several {{internal}} organs of the animal can be distinguished through the shell's outer surface.

5|$|Potassium is {{the second}} least dense metal after lithium. It is a soft solid with a low melting point, and can be easily cut with a knife.

In this system, both the milk snakes and the deadly coral snakes are mimics, whereas the false coral snakes are the model. It has also been suggested that this system could be an instance of pseudomimicry, the similar colour patterns having evolved independently in similar habitats.|$|E
5|$|Sutorius eximius, {{commonly}} known as the lilac-brown bolete, is a species of fungus in the family Boletaceae. This bolete produces fruit bodies that are dark purple to chocolate brown in <b>color</b> <b>with</b> a smooth cap, a finely scaly stipe, and a reddish-brown spore print. The tiny pores on the cap underside are chocolate to violet brown. It is widely distributed, having been recorded on North America, South America, and Asia, where it grows in a mycorrhizal relationship with both coniferous and deciduous trees.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We study online {{interval}} <b>coloring</b> problems <b>with</b> bandwidth. We {{are interested}} in some variants motivated by bin packing problems.

We construct competitive algorithms for each of the variants. Additionally, we present a lower bound of 24 / 7 for interval <b>coloring</b> <b>with</b> bandwidth, which holds for all the above models, and improves the current lower bound for the standard interval <b>coloring</b> <b>with</b> bandwidth problem. ...|$|R

5|$|The antbirds are a {{large family}} of small {{passerine}} birds of subtropical and tropical Central and South America. They are forest birds which tend to feed on insects {{at or near the}} ground. A sizable minority of them specialize in following columns of army ants to eat small invertebrates that leave their hiding places to flee from the ants. Many species lack bright <b>color,</b> <b>with</b> brown, black, and white being the dominant tones.|$|E
5|$|The ascospores {{produced}} by Polytolypa are , yellow to yellow-orange in <b>color,</b> <b>with</b> dimensions of 2.5–5 by 3–4μm. Viewed {{with a light}} microscope their surfaces appear to be smooth, but under scanning electron microscopy, they are revealed to be densely marked with punctures and small, hard, sharp projections. The structures that produce the ascospores are called asci. In Polytolypa they are numerous, spherical, and measure 9–10 by 12–13μm. Each ascus contains eight ascospores, which are released when the ascus dissolves away at maturity. The anamorph (asexual form of the fungus) resembles the genus Chrysosporium.|$|E

5|$|Two other Chroogomphus {{species with}} a {{morphology}} and coloration similar to C.vinicolor include C.rutilus and C.ochraceous. C.vinicolor is most reliably distinguished from these {{on the basis}} of having thick-walled cystidia (up to 5–7.5μm at the widest part). The other two species have been separated {{on the basis of}} <b>color,</b> <b>with</b> C.ochraceous having brighter colors (yellowish-orange to ochraceous) than C.rutilus. Molecular analyses of European and North American collections suggest that C.rutilus is restricted to Europe, C.ochraceous only occurs in North America, and that cap coloration cannot be reliably used for species determination.|$|E
5|$|Various {{chemical}} color {{tests can}} be used to help identify fruit bodies suspected to be S.amygdalinus. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) will turn the cap flesh dingy orange, while it turns the cap cuticle red, or darker. Ammonia (as ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH) produces a dingy yellow on the flesh, and brown on the cap. Iron sulphate (FeSO4) produces either no change to a pale grey <b>color</b> <b>with</b> both the flesh and the cuticle. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) causes the flesh to turn orange or pink, but has no color reaction with the cuticle.|$|E
