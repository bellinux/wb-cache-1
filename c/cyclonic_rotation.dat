5|$|The system {{originated}} {{from one of}} several powerful tropical waves that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa {{in the second half of}} August.

Late on August 21, it formed a low-level circulation and was declared Tropical Depression Nine. The system quickly matured and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Humberto early on August 22. Beginning on a west-northwest track, it was clear from the outset that Humberto would not affect land, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge to the north which would eventually turn the storm northward. Favorable outflow and distinct banding pattern quickly formed in a very conducive environment, with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. Humberto intensified into a high-end tropical storm on the afternoon and evening of August 22. Early on August 23, the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Humberto.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} effect of the {{background}} rotation on the radiative instability of a columnar Rankine vortex in a strongly stratified fluid. We show that a <b>cyclonic</b> background <b>rotation</b> strongly stabilizes the radiative instability. The modes become neutral when the Rossby number Ro is below a critical value which depends on the azimuthal wavenumber of the wave. In the limit of small Rossby number, there exist fast neutral waves that are not captured by the quasi-geostrophic theory. In the presence of anticyclonic background rotation, the centrifugal instability dominates the radiative instability only when - 400 less than or similar to Ro < - 1. The numerical stability analysis is completed by asymptotic analyses for large wavenumbers which explain the properties and mechanisms of the waves and the instabilities. The stability of a continuous smoothed Rankine vortex is also investigated. The most amplified azimuthal wavenumber is then finite instead of infinite for the Rankine vortex.

40|$|Abstract: Particle image {{velocimetry}} (PIV) is used {{to study}} the turbulent flow over the rib-roughened wall of a cooling channel model in rotation. The aspect ratio is 0. 9, the blockage ratio is 0. 1 and the rib pitch-to-height ratio is 10. The flow direction is outward, with a Reynolds number of 1. 5 104 and a rotation number of 0. 3 in both rotational directions. The PIV system rotates with the channel, allowing to directly measure the relative flow velocity with high spatial and temporal resolution. Coriolis forces affect {{the stability of the}} shear layers: <b>cyclonic</b> (anticy-clonic) <b>rotation</b> inhibits (enhances) the turbulent motion, influencing velocity, vorticity, and turbulence intensity of the flow. The time-resolved measurements show the effect of rotation on the shear layer instability and on the consequent formation of spanwise vortices, {{as well as on the}} time trace of the reattachment point. Turbulent energy spectra suggest that all temporal scales are affected by rotation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{strongly}} stratified fluids, an axisymmetric vertical columnar vortex is unstable {{because of}} a spontaneous radiation of internal waves. The growth rate of this radiative instability is strongly reduced {{in the presence of}} a <b>cyclonic</b> background <b>rotation</b> f/ 2 and is smaller than the growth rate of the centrifugal instability for anticyclonic rotation, so it is generally expected to affect vortices in geophysical flows only if the Rossby number Ro = 2 Omega/f is large (where Omega is the angular velocity of the vortex). However, we show here that an anticyclonic Rankine vortex with low Rossby number in the range - 1 <= Ro < 0, which is centrifugally stable, is unstable to the radiative instability when the azimuthal wavenumber vertical bar m vertical bar is larger than 2. Its growth rate for Ro = - 1 is comparable to the values reported in non-rotating stratified fluids. In the case of continuous vortex profiles, this new radiative instability is shown to occur if the potential vorticity of the base flow has a sufficiently steep radial profile. The most unstable azimuthal wavenumber is inversely proportional to the steepness of the vorticity jump. The properties and mechanism of the instability are explained by asymptotic analyses for large wavenumbers...|$|R
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on June 12. It tracked westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean with minimal convection, and subsequent to moving through the southern Windward Islands it crossed northern Central America. Convection increased on June 20 as the wave entered the southwestern Caribbean. Under the influence of southeasterly flow from developing Hurricane Celia in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the south-southwesterly flow from a mid- to upper-level trough over the Gulf of Mexico, the area of disturbed weather tracked generally north-northwestward through the Caribbean Sea while spreading across Cuba and southern Florida. On June 24, a mid-level circulation developed near the Yucatán Channel, and shortly thereafter satellite image loops indicated deep convection with some <b>cyclonic</b> <b>rotation</b> near the western tip of Cuba. A reconnaissance aircraft flight was dispatched late on June 24 into the system to determine if it developed into a tropical cyclone, though the flight did not observe evidence of a closed low-level circulation. Subsequent to the flight, satellite imagery indicated a low-level circulation was forming, and on June 25 ship and buoy data confirmed the system developed into Tropical Depression One while located about 235miles (375km) west-southwest of Key West, Florida. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center incorrectly classified the system as Tropical Depression Two due to an earlier subtropical storm.|$|E
5|$|In early August, an extratropical trough {{moved off}} the coast of South Carolina and Georgia, with a {{stationary}} front extending from it. A weak low-pressure area began to develop {{at the southern end of}} the front just offshore of Jacksonville, Florida. Initially, the storm had an open center of circulation and remained a frontal low as it moved southwestward across Florida, and thus was not considered a fully tropical system at the time. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, however, observations indicated that the disturbance developed a closed center of circulation. As a result, the storm was analyzed to have developed into a tropical depression off the western coast of Florida at 1200UTC on August3. At the time, weather reports revealed a definite <b>cyclonic</b> <b>rotation,</b> though the depression had a shallow minimum barometric pressure of 1012.5mbar (hPa; 29.90inHg). Moving west-southwest, the depression steadily intensified and attained tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC on August4. Late that evening, the tropical storm executed a slight northward curve. Strengthening continued into the following day, and ships in the storm's vicinity began to report a much stronger storm than was previously suggested. A ship reported the first gale-force winds associated with the storm at 2100UTC on August4. The S.S. Connecticut observed force11 winds, the strongest wind measurement associated with the storm as recorded by vessel. A minimum pressure of 995mbar (hPa; 29.39inHg) was analyzed for the system at 0600UTC on August5 based on an observation from a nearby ship.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{generation}} of large-scale vortices in rotating turbulent convection by means of Cartesian direct numerical simulations. We find that for sufficiently rapid <b>rotation,</b> <b>cyclonic</b> structures on a scale large in comparison {{to that of the}} convective eddies, emerge, provided that the fluid Reynolds number exceeds a critical value. For slower <b>rotation,</b> cool <b>cyclonic</b> vortices are preferred, whereas for rapid rotation, warm anti-cyclonic vortices are favored. In some runs in the intermediate regime both types of cyclones co-exist for thousands of convective turnover times. The temperature contrast between the vortices and the surrounding atmosphere is of the order of five per cent. We relate the simulation results to observations of rapidly rotating late-type stars that are known to exhibit large high-latitude spots from Doppler imaging. In many cases, cool spots are accompanied with spotted regions with temperatures higher than the average. In this paper, we investigate a scenario according to which the spots observed in the temperature maps could have a non-magnetic origin due to large-scale vortices in the convection zones of the stars.

40|$|Exceptionally {{saline water}} with the mean volume flux of about 10 km/d passed the Danish straits during the winter 1997 - 98 to spread towards the Baltic Proper. The {{released}} inflow event is discussed by means of different hydrographic data sets. For the first time, its influence on the deep circulation of the Eastern Gotland Basin was continuously documented. Time series of temperature and current with a length {{of more than one}} year precisely determined the duration of that inflow. It started over the eastern topographic flank of this basin and lasted 130 days. Once in the basin, the spreading of dense deep water formed a wedge-shaped frontal zone rotating anticlockwise with the background velocity of about 3 cm/s. Beneath 170 m depth, associated currents roughly followed the isobaths. Adjacent intrusions intensified this <b>cyclonic</b> deep water <b>rotation</b> by a factor of two while rhythmically occurring inflow pulses with a quasi-period of about 20 days additionally accelerated the circulation by a factor of about three. A total of six pulses induced a high temporal variability in mass and current fields. They were accompanied by linearly increasing temperatures within near bottom layers. Each new inflow pulse started on the thermal level of previous pulses. Finally, the net intrusion of warm, saline, but weakly oxygenated dense water completely fulfilled the closed basin volume of 38 km. The associated mean volume flux was about 0. 3 km/d. Released upward motions well integrated vertical changes of the topographic volume. This follows from the comparison of two eddy resolving data sets, which were obtained from hydrographic surveys carried out during the pre-inflow and post-inflow situation...|$|R
40|$|The Adriatic Sea surface {{circulation}} for {{the period}} 1990 – 1999 is studied using the data of more than 200 satellite-tracked drifters.

Maps of mean currents, subtidal velocity variance and mean kinetic energies were produced using a 40 -km averaging scale. The mean flow map confirms that the global cyclonic circulation in most of the Adriatic basin is broken into three Žre-circulation cells in the northern, central and southern sub-basins the latter two being controlled by the bathymetry of the.

50|$|Hurricane Katrina was a {{category}} 3 cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale indicating {{that it was}} only a moderate level storm.

For several days prior to landfall of Katrina, wave set up was generated by the persistent winds of the <b>cyclonic</b> <b>rotation</b> of the system. This prolonged wave set up coupled with the very low central pressure level meant massive storm surges were generated. Storm surges overtopped and breached the levees and flood walls intended to protect the city from inundation. Unfortunately New Orleans is inherently prone to coastal flooding for a number of factors. Firstly, much of New Orleans is below sea level and is bordered by the Mississippi River therefore protection against flooding from both the sea and the river has become dependent on engineered structures. Land use change and modification to natural systems in the Mississippi River have rendered the natural defences for the city less effective.

As the wave distanced itself from the islands, development of thunderstorms and showers in its proximity continued to remain scarce, and it became rather broad in appearance. On August 19, the convective structure began to show signs of organization as the associated atmospheric pressure lowered, and with a progressively favorable environment situated ahead of the wave its chances of undergoing tropical cyclogenesis markedly increased. The strong thunderstorm activity continued to become more pronounced around the main low-pressure feature. By August 20, the National Hurricane Center noted that tropical cyclone formation was imminent as the wave neared the Lesser Antilles, and a reconnaissance aircraft confirmed the presence of a small surface circulation center just southwest of a burst of vigorous convection and unusually high sustained winds, indicating sufficient organization for the cyclone to be upgraded into Tropical Storm Irene at 23:00 UTC that day.|$|E
