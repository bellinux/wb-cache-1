5|$|Historical {{records for}} Gardner Carpenter's life are sparse in detail, but the Vital records of Norwich, 1659-1848 Part II provide some information. Gardner <b>Carpenter</b> married Mary Huntington, {{daughter}} of Benjamin Huntington Jr., on October 29, 1791. <b>Carpenter</b> {{was a local}} business man who operated his mercantile business in a shop that was shared with his brother, Joseph <b>Carpenter,</b> the silversmith.

In 1793, the house which is now known as the <b>Carpenter</b> House was constructed on the property after a previous house on the land was removed. Gardner and Mary <b>Carpenter</b> would have six children together; their first son, George, was born in 1795 and their first and only daughter, Mary Elizabeth, in 1797. Another son, Gardner <b>Carpenter,</b> was born in 1802 and was followed by Henry in 1804, John in 1807 and Charles in 1810. Gardiner <b>Carpenter</b> served as a pay master in the 17th Connecticut Regiment in the American Revolutionary War and he was the postmaster of Norwich from 1799 to 1814, shortly before his death in 1815. His wife, Mary <b>Carpenter,</b> died in 1838. The house was sold to Joseph Huntington after Carpenter's death, who would add a third story around 1816. The house was sold again to Reverend Hiram P. Arms in 1841.|$|E
