40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The <b>crista</b> galli {{is part of}} the ethmoid bone and, as such, {{it could}} be {{expected}} that aeration of the <b>crista</b> would come from ethmoid cells. After observing <b>crista</b> pneuma-tization from the frontal sinuses in several cases, we undertook this study to establish how often <b>crista</b> galli pneumatization came from the frontal sinuses rather than from the ethmoid complex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred consecutive CT scans of the paranasal sinuses were studied in adult patients to obtain the incidence of <b>crista</b> galli pneumatization and the cell of origin for this phenomenon. A second group of 132 children, 0 – 7 years of age, was studied to see if any <b>crista</b> galli pneumatization occurred before frontal sinus development. A third group of 79 children, 7 – 12 years of age, was also studied to see when <b>crista</b> pneumatization occurred in children whose frontal sinuses had already extended into the squamosal portion of the frontal bone. RESULTS: Of the 200 adult cases, there were 26 patients (13 %) with <b>crista</b> galli pneumatization, all from either the left or right frontal sinuses. In the second group of children 0 – 7 years of age, there were no cases of <b>crista</b> pneumatization. In the third group of children 7 – 12 years of age, there were 4 cases of <b>crista</b> galli pneumatization, all from well-developed frontal sinuses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that <b>crista</b> galli pneumatization is virtually exclusively from eithe...|$|R

25|$|The {{structure}} of the inner mitochondrial membrane is extensively folded and compartmentalized. The numerous invaginations of the membrane are called <b>cristae,</b> separated by crista junctions from the inner boundary membrane juxtaposed to the outer membrane. <b>Cristae</b> significantly increase the total membrane surface area compared to a smooth inner membrane and thereby the available working space.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cristae</b> and {{the inner}} {{boundary}} membranes are separated by junctions. The end of <b>cristae</b> are partially closed by transmembrane protein complexes that bind head to head and link opposing crista membranes in a bottleneck-like fashion. For example, deletion of the junction protein Mitofilin/Fcj1 leads to a reduced inner membrane potential and impaired growth and to dramatically aberrant inner membrane structures which form concentric stacks instead of the typical invaginations.|$|E

40|$|Background: Amyloidosis, {{oxidative}} stress and inflammation have been strongly implicated in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer′s disease. Traditionally, Caesalpinia <b>crista</b> and Centella asiatica leaf extracts {{are used to}} treat brain related diseases in India. C. <b>crista</b> {{is used as a}} mental relaxant drink as well as to treat inflammatory diseases, whereas C. asiatica is reported to be used to enhance memory and to treat dementia. Objective: The present study is aimed to understand the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of C. asiatica and C. <b>crista</b> leaf extracts. Materials and Methods: Phenolic acid composition of the aqueous extracts of C. <b>crista</b> and C. asiatica were separated on a reverse phase C 18 column (4. 6 x 250 mm) using HPLC system. Antioxidant properties of the leaf extracts were determined by 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay and the reducing potential assay. The anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous extracts of C. <b>crista</b> and C. asiatica were studied using 5 -lipoxygenase assay. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) were isolated from blood by Ficoll-Histopaque density gradient followed by hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes. Results: Gallic, protocatechuic, gentisic, chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids were the phenolic acids identified in C. <b>crista</b> and C. asiatica leaf aqueous extracts. However, gallic acid and ferulic acid contents were much higher in C. <b>crista</b> compared to C. asiatica. Leaf extracts of C. asiatica and C. <b>crista</b> exhibited antioxidant properties and inhibited 5 -lipoxygenase (anti-inflammatory) in a dose dependent manner. However, leaf extracts of C. <b>crista</b> had better antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity compared to that of C. asiatica. The better activity of C. <b>crista</b> is attributed to high gallic acid and ferulic acid compared to C. asiatica. Conclusions: Thus, the leaf extract of C. <b>crista</b> can be a potential therapeutic role for Alzheimer′s disease...|$|R

40|$|The impulses {{coming from}} the sinus node synchronically {{penetrate}} the A V node via the <b>crista</b> terminalis and inter-atrial septum. Studies in superfused rabbit A Vpreparations suggest that the <b>crista</b> terminalis is a more effective input than the inter-atrial septum, and that the summation of both inputs facilitates A V nodal conduction. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify the hypothesis in a more physiological model, such as the whole rabbit heart perfused by a Langendorff system. Fifteen rabbit hearts were studied in a Langendorffperfusion system with six bipolar extracellular electrodes: two for stimulating (<b>crista</b> terminalis and inter-atrial septum) and four for recording (<b>crista</b> terminalis, inter-atrial septum, His bundle electrogram and right ventricle). Seven hearts (Group I) were consecutively paced at the <b>crista</b> terminalis, inter-atrial septum and both sites simultaneously, to determine the A V nodal Wenckebach cycle length and effective refractory period under basal conditions and after acetylcholine (0 - 75 x 10 6 ı).

There were no basal differences in AV nodal parameters during <b>crista</b> terminalis pacing, inter-atrial septum pacing or simultaneous stimulation in both sites in Group I; after acetylcholine, the AV nodal Wenckebach cycle length and effective refractory period tended to be shorter during <b>crista</b> terminalis pacing (<b>crista</b> terminalis = 188 ± 33 and 147 ± 34; inter...|$|R
5000|$|This {{gene product}} is a nuclear-encoded {{mitochondrial}} protein with similarity to dynamin-related GTPases. It is {{a component of}} the mitochondrial network. The OPA1 protein localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it regulates mitochondrial fusion and <b>cristae</b> structure. OPA1 mediates mitochondrial fusion in cooperation with mitofusins 1 and 2 and participates in <b>cristae</b> remodeling by the oligomerization of two L-OPA1 and one S-OPA1, which then interact with other protein complexes to alter <b>cristae</b> structure. Its <b>cristae</b> regulating function also contributes to its role in oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis, as it is required to maintain mitochondrial activity during low-energy substrate availability. Moreover, stabilization of mitochondrial <b>cristae</b> by OPA1 protects against mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome c release, and reactive oxygen species production, thus preventing cell death. Mitochondrial SLC25A transporters can detect these low levels and stimulate OPA1 oligomerization, leading to tightening of the <b>cristae,</b> enhanced assembly of ATP synthase, and increased ATP production. [...] Stress from an apoptotic response can interfere with OPA1 oligomerization and prevent mitochondrial fusion.|$|E
