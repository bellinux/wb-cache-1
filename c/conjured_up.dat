5|$|James Device {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murders by {{witchcraft}} of Anne Townley and John Duckworth. However he, like Chattox, had earlier made a confession to Nowell, which was read out in court. That, and the evidence presented against him by his sister Jennet, who said that she had seen her brother asking a black dog he had <b>conjured</b> <b>up</b> to help him kill Townley, was sufficient to persuade the jury to find him guilty.|$|E
5|$|No {{drawings}} or {{paintings of}} Sherwood exist, but contemporary accounts describe her as attractive and tall and possessing {{a sense of}} humor. Sherwood wore trousers instead of a dress while working on her farm. This was unusual for the time, as was her herb growing. The combination of clothing and good looks was said to attract men and upset their wives. Sherwood biographer and advocate Belinda Nash suggests that Sherwood's neighbors may have been jealous of Sherwood, and that the witchcraft tales may have been <b>conjured</b> <b>up</b> {{in an effort to}} remove her from, and subsequently get, her property. Sherwood was a party to at least a dozen lawsuits, in which she had to defend against accusations of witchcraft, or in which she sued her accusers for slander.|$|E

500|$|After a {{month in}} Los Angeles with no results, the band opted to return to England. They rented Clearwell Castle in The Forest of Dean. [...] "We rehearsed in the dungeons {{and it was really}} creepy but it had some atmosphere, it <b>conjured</b> <b>up</b> things, and stuff started coming out again." [...] While working in the dungeon, Iommi {{stumbled}} onto the main riff of [...] "Sabbath Bloody Sabbath", which {{set the tone for the}} new material. Recorded at Morgan Studios in London by Mike Butcher and building off the stylistic changes introduced on Volume 4, new songs incorporated synthesisers, strings, and complex arrangements.

500|$|While Shonen Knife's usual {{sound is}} Ramones-inspired pop punk, the band {{branched}} out musically {{and listened to}} harder rock bands for Overdrive, such as such as Black Sabbath, Thin Lizzy, Bad Company, Deep Purple, Judas Priest, Boston, ZZ Top, and The Doobie Brothers—for inspiration. IAmTunedUp.com described the album's sound as a combination of [...] "edgy guitar riffs with psychedelic 70s-esque enchanting nostalgia". Naoko Yamano reasoned that because Free Time (2010) was heavily influenced by punk rock, and Pop Tune (2012) explored a more pop-oriented sound, Overdrive represented {{an opportunity for the}} band to explore harder rock. Because of the band's exploration, the album's name references the overdrive pedal, which, in Yamano's mind, <b>conjured</b> <b>up</b> images of 1970s rock music.|$|E

500|$|The {{introduction}} of midi-chloriansmicroscopic organisms that mediate {{use of the}} Forcein the film has been controversial among fans. Some viewed it as a concept that negates the Force's spiritual quality, although the film still portrays the Force as a mysterious entity using the midi-chlorians to communicate with living beings. Film historian Daniel Dinello says [...] "Anathema to Star Wars fanatics who thought they reduced the Force {{to a kind of}} viral infection, midi-chlorians provide a biological interface, the link between physical bodies and spiritual energy."

500|$|In 2005, Vulović's {{fall was}} recreated by the American {{television}} program MythBusters, which concluded that surviving such a plunge was unlikely but plausible. Four years later, Peter Hornung-Andersen and Pavel Theiner, two Prague-based journalists, claimed that Flight 367 had been mistaken for an enemy aircraft and {{shot down by}} the Czechoslovak Air Force {{at an altitude of}} [...] The two claimed that the Czechoslovak State Security had <b>conjured</b> <b>up</b> Vulović's record fall as part of a cover-up. They hypothesized that the call received by the Kvällsposten, claiming responsibility for the aircraft's downing, was a hoax. The Czech Civil Aviation Authority dismissed the journalists' claim, calling it a conspiracy theory. Hornung-Andersen conceded that the pair's evidence was only circumstantial. Vulović said that she was aware of the journalists' claims, but stated that because she had no memory of the event, she could not confirm or deny the allegations. Guinness World Records continues to list her as the record-holder for surviving the highest fall without a parachute.|$|E
500|$|A recent {{nickname}} for Town is [...] "The Tractor Boys", which was coined during the club's brief {{period in the}} Premiership (2000–01 and 2001–02) when the team regularly competed against more fashionable clubs. The nickname {{is an example of}} self-deprecating humour referring to Ipswich's agricultural heritage. The origins of the nickname are not certain, but the first generally accepted use of the nickname was created whilst playing at Leeds United in 2000–2001: Ipswich were winning the game 2–1 and the Leeds fans started chanting, 'We're being beaten by a bunch of tractor drivers.' Barracking by supporters of more established Premiership clubs during Town's spell in the Premiership lent the ironic chant '1–0 to the Tractor Boys' increased potency and publicity, and the nickname is commonly used by the media. Former Town manager Jim Magilton commented, in the local press, that he disliked the nickname and said that it <b>conjured</b> <b>up,</b> 'images of carrot-crunching yokels', while players such as Matt Holland accepted the chant with good humour.|$|E

500|$|However, Disney {{found that}} the new Pinocchio was too {{helpless}} and was far too often led astray by deceiving characters. Therefore, {{in the summer of}} 1938 Disney and his story team established the character of the cricket. Originally the cricket was only a minor character that Pinocchio killed by squashing him with a mallet and that later returned as a ghost. Disney dubbed the cricket Jiminy, and made him into a character that would try to guide Pinocchio into the right decisions. Once the character was expanded, he was depicted as a realistic cricket with toothed legs and waving antennae, but Disney wanted something more likable. Ward Kimball had spent several months animating a [...] "Soup Eating Sequence" [...] in Snow White, which was cut from the film due to pacing reasons. Kimball was about to quit until Disney rewarded him for his work by promoting him to the supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket. Kimball <b>conjured</b> <b>up</b> the design for Jiminy Cricket, whom he described as a little man with an egg head and no ears. [...] "The only thing that makes him a cricket is because we call him one," [...] Kimball later joked.|$|E
500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{started its}} closing speech by {{drawing attention to}} the [...] "cool and calculating" [...] {{manner in which the}} children were killed. [...] Knight also argued that the accused could not have shared the same delusion, and only brought it up during the trial. [...] The [...] "cunning and deliberation" [...] displayed in the acts could not have been done by a deluded person. [...] Tan helped Lim because [...] "she loved [...] ", and Hoe was simply misled into helping the crimes. [...] Urging the judges to consider the ramifications of their verdict, Knight said: [...] "My Lords, to say that Lim was less than a coward who preyed on little children because they could not fight back; killed them in the hope that he would gain power or wealth and therefore did not commit murder, is to make no sense of the law of murder. [...] It would lend credence to the shroud of mystery and magic he has <b>conjured</b> <b>up</b> his practices and by which he managed to frighten, intimidate and persuade the superstitious, the weak and the gullible into participating in the most lewd and obscene acts." ...|$|E
500|$|After its release, [...] "This Used to Be My Playground" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , called the track a [...] "melancholic performance". Michelle Morgan, {{author of the}} book Madonna, described it as a [...] "beautiful ballad". Similarly, Humberto Quiroga Lavié called it one of Madonna's best ballads in his essay Secretos y Misterios de Hombres y Mujeres. Author Rikky Rooksby wrote in his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, that the song was appropriate for the film and its nostalgic moment towards the end, showing the characters grown up and reuniting at a museum opened for themselves and the titular league. He called it [...] "one of Madonna's very best recordings and most expressive single". While reviewing Something to Remember, author Chris Wade wrote in his book The Music of Madonna, that the song <b>conjured</b> <b>up</b> a [...] "strangely sad, nostalgic feel, reminding ourselves of memories from yesteryear". He commended Madonna's vocals calling it as the song's [...] "premier sound" [...] and adding that the way [...] "she sings and captures the melancholic melody is heartbreaking [...] it's one of her finest ever ballads." [...] Encyclopedia Madonnica writer and journalist Matthew Rettenmund noted in the book that the song's rise {{to the top of the}} charts was aided by its [...] "honest delivery and aching sense of loneliness, regret and nostalgia for friendship lost." ...|$|E

500|$|Stevenson {{suggested}} an alternative cover. He instructed the Polydor art department to design artwork using four statues from the Guards Memorial, from a photo session the band had recently done {{in front of}} the monument which commemorates the war dead of the First World War. Four of the soldier statues were cut out from the shot of the band. Siouxsie found the sleeve a workable solution, as she was drawn in by the imagery <b>conjured</b> <b>up</b> by the words for [...] "In Flanders Fields", which inspired [...] "Poppy Day". For her, it was the linchpin for the album. The poppy reproduced on the album cover is a symbol of Remembrance Day. The designer, Rob O'Connor, said about the layout: [...] "The wreath of poppies was devised to help add colour and create a graphic device". An embossed sleeve was planned, with the four soldiers inked in the card, but was not used because the band did not receive the proofs in time. Morris and McKay blamed Stevenson, Siouxsie and Severin, although it was Polydor that refused the extra expense at the last minute. Nevertheless, Severin succeeded in pushing for a gatefold cover: [...] "We wanted it all white because you were supposed to do it all black, and you were supposed to have blackmail lettering on it and so we had it nice and classic", he stated. Maybury's drawings of the band were used on the inner spread; it was {{the only part of the}} original design that survived.|$|E
