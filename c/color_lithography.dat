25|$|The {{development}} of <b>color</b> <b>lithography</b> {{in the late}} 1870s allowed the companies to create attractive images to better present their products. This led to the printing of pictures onto the cigarette cards, previously only used to stiffen the packaging but now turned into an early marketing concept.|$|E

By 1900 the medium in both color and monotone was an accepted part of printmaking.|$|E
50|$|Svensson {{sought out}} his motifs among the islets and skerries around the summer cottage and studio at Stora Tornö, across the Långvik strait on Möja in the Stockholm archipelago. He also wrote books {{describing}} the seasonal {{changes in the}} arcepelago with deep and vivid animation. His style was forceful and impressionistic but not without a strong feeling for decorative elements. He preferred to draw with coal. His views on Swedish nature and Swedish characteristics is close to that of Karl Nordström and Albert Engström. He became much noted through his <b>color</b> <b>lithography's.</b>|$|R
25|$|Aloys Senefelder, the {{inventor}} of lithography, introduced the subject of <b>colored</b> <b>lithography</b> in his 1818 Vollstaendiges Lehrbuch der Steindruckerey (A Complete Course of Lithography), where he told of his plans to print using color and explained the colors he wished {{to be able to}} print someday. Although Senefelder recorded plans for chromolithography, printers in other countries, such as France and England, were also trying to find a new way to print in color. Godefroy Engelmann of Mulhouse in France was awarded a patent on chromolithography in July 1837, but there are disputes over whether chromolithography was already in use before this date, as some sources say, pointing to areas of printing such as the production of playing cards.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually, {{his style}} came to {{strongly}} feature late period Japanese elements and techniques, evoking the “floating world” of the 18th and 19th centuries. His highly recognizable, occasionally “militaristic” approach was developed over decades {{to its current}} status {{as a point of}} reference for the genre. [...] He was considered a master of abstract <b>color</b> relief <b>lithography</b> with a considerable following among those knowledgeable in this field. His earliest works featured landscape vistas fused with broadly martial representations, alternatively peaceful, then vaguely soldierly and even bellicose in composition.|$|R

50|$|Sometimes {{the exact}} {{form of a}} dot gain curve is {{difficult}} to model {{on the basis of}} geometry, and empirical modeling is used instead. To a certain extent, the models described above are empirical, as their parameters cannot be accurately determined from physical aspects of image microstructure and first principles. However, polynomials, cubic splines, and interpolation are completely empirical, and do not involve any image-related parameters. Such models were used by Pearson and Pobboravsky, for example, in their program to compute dot area fractions needed to produce a particular <b>color</b> in <b>lithography.</b>|$|R
50|$|Readership {{increased}} dramatically. Circulation totals {{showed that}} in 1980, the Democrat was the fastest growing newspaper in the United States. Innovations continued, {{including the use of}} <b>color</b> with offset <b>lithography</b> printing presses. The Democrats revenues increased from $6.7 million in 1979 to $18.4 million in 1984. The Democrat increased its daily circulation from 53,671 to 76,119. Its Sunday circulation leaped from 98,237 to 140,642 over the same period. Distraught The Gazette management filed a federal antitrust suit, accusing Hussman of trying to put The Gazette out of business. On March 26, 1986, a federal jury exonerated Hussman in a verdict rendered in the Little Rock courtroom of U.S. District Judge William R. Overton.|$|R
50|$|In 1940, the by then vacant brownstone {{building}} {{was selected as}} the site for the planned community art center and was purchased for about $8,000 with funds raised by the community. The building is sometimes referred to as the Comiskey Mansion, and it was described as the former home of Charles Comiskey by Eleanor Roosevelt in her newspaper column after she took part in the dedication of the South Side Community Art Center. According to UNCAP, the Uncovering New Chicago Archives Project, the house belonging to Comiskey was further south on Michigan Avenue. The community paid for the lease and purchase of the building, for utilities, and for art supplies. The federal government helped to stimulate the establishment of the center via support from the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project. They provided administrative funds for staff and faculty and funds for the remodeling of the building. The interior was remodeled in the New Bauhaus-style by Hin Bredendieck and Nathan Lerner and the centre opened unofficially for its first classes on December 15, 1940. The opening was accompanied by an inaugural exhibition of paintings by local black artists including Charles Davis, Charles White, Bernard Goss, William Carter, Eldzier Cortor, Charles Sebree, Archibald Motley, Jr., amongst others. The interracial faculty of art instructors included Davis, White, Goss, Carter, Morris Topchevsky, Si Gordon, Max Kahn, and Todros Geller. Lessons were free and included oil painting, drawing, composition, water <b>color,</b> sculpture, <b>lithography,</b> poster design, fashion illustration, interior decoration, silk screen, weaving, and hooked rug-making. By March 1941, 13,500 people had attended classes, exhibitions, and events at the center. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt dedicated the facility May 7, 1941, in a ceremony that broadcast nationwide on CBS Radio.|$|R

50|$|Technical {{developments}} like <b>color</b> <b>lithography</b> in 1930 propelled the manufactured greeting card industry forward. Humorous greeting cards, {{known as}} studio cards, became {{popular in the}} late 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
40|$|Reproduction {{of pastel}} <b>colors</b> by offset <b>lithography</b> {{produces}} images that have less color saturation than their continuous tone counterparts. This problem is primarily {{attributable to the}} halftone structure which approximates continuous tone pastels with large amounts of white paper and small amounts of chromatic ink. This thesis investigates the effect of screen frequency upon pastel color saturation. Single and two color overprint tints of nominal five, 10, and 15 percent printing dot areas were printed in 85, 100, 120, 133, 150, and 200 lines screen rulings. The reflectances of these colors were measured with a colorimeter and converted to CIEL*a*b* color notation to provide metric lightness and the chromatic co-ordinates from which chroma was calculated. Physical dot area was calculated by the Yule- Nielson equation for each single color patch. A more complicated graphical technique was used to find this data for the overprint colors of the same physical dot areas. For both single and overprint colors, as screen ruling becomes progressively finer, pastel saturation increased with physical dot area held constant. For this experiment, the average chroma difference at the 10 percent physical dot area between the coarsest and finest line screen ruling is 2 chroma units. This difference could also be achieved by changing physical dot area by one percent. The amount of saturation increase is dot area and hue dependent. The yellow printer showed the greatest saturation increase. The saturation increase increased with dot area for a given screen frequency. 2 Lightness decreased whenever saturation increased. When the saturation associated with the different screen rulings were compared at equal darknesses, an increase in saturation could not be statistically determined. The saturation increase from increased screen ruling at equal physical dot areas occurs because of the increased ink/light/paper interaction. Optical dot area is calculated by the Murray·Davies equation which does not compensate for this change in optical interaction. The experiment shows that at equal optical dot areas, chroma {{will be the same}} regardless of screen ruling...|$|R

5000|$|While {{also being}} a muralist and sculptor, Glenny's {{work as a}} graphic artist {{consisted}} of American Art Nouveau posters. With the development of <b>color</b> <b>lithography,</b> the production of posters was elevated worldwide from what H.C. Bunner had called a [...] "primitive system" [...] in which woodblocks were harshly carved allowing for an imprecision of color and shape. <b>Color</b> <b>lithography</b> provided American advertisers with the means of creating eye-catching and beautifully rendered pictures, often of fashionable women. Poster design in America was influenced {{by a number of}} emerging styles from countries such as France and Britain. French poster design, largely influenced by woodblock printing in Japan, was well received in the United States when Harper's Magazine commissioned Franco-Swiss artist Eugène Grasset to create covers in 1889, 1891, 1892, and in April 1893. Exposure to these international styles ignited a [...] "poster craze" [...] in which American graphic designers developed a style commonly [...] "depicting bourgeois scenes" [...] and utilizing more stylized lines filled with blocks of color, similar to the designs of artists such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Alphonse Mucha.|$|E

50|$|The {{graphic arts}} {{flourished in the}} Art Nouveau period, thanks to new {{technologies}} of printing, particularly <b>color</b> <b>lithography</b> which allowed the mass production of color posters. Art was no longer confined to galleries, museums and salons; it could be found on Paris walls, and in illustrated art magazines, which circulated throughout Europe and to the United States. The most popular theme of Art Nouveau posters was women; women symbolizing glamour, modernity and beauty, often surrounded by flowers.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the advent}} of printing, the sale of reproductions of pious works {{has been a major}} element of popular Christian culture. In the 19th century, this {{included}} genre painters such as Mihály Munkácsy. The invention of <b>color</b> <b>lithography</b> led to broad circulation of holy cards. In the modern era, companies specializing in modern commercial Christian artists such as Thomas Blackshear and Thomas Kinkade, although widely regarded in the fine art world as kitsch, have been very successful.|$|E
50|$|Guérin's {{work as a}} book {{illustrator}} came as {{a result}} of magazine commissions. Articles in The Century by Maria Hornor Lansdale resulted in her 1906 travel book, The Chateaux of Touraine, which supplements its many photographs with Guérin's paintings. From 1909 to 1911 the painter traveled with Robert Hichens to create similar illustrations for his popular books on Egypt, the Holy Land, and the Near East. The superb <b>color</b> <b>lithography</b> in these books, as well as two he published with Maxfield Parish, has made them highly collectible today.|$|E
