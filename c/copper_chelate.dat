40|$|<b>Copper</b> <b>chelate</b> of L-lysinate-HCl, {{provided}} as powder and as granulate, {{is intended for}} use as a copper source in animal nutrition. Tolerance studies with chicken for fattening and weaned piglets, allowed the FEEDAP Panel to conclude that <b>copper</b> <b>chelate</b> of L-lysinate-HCl is a safe source of copper for all animal species, provided that the maximum copper contents authorised in feed are respected. The supplementation of feeds with copper from <b>copper</b> <b>chelate</b> of L-lysinate-HCl up to the maximum authorised copper levels is not expected to result in a different copper deposition in edible tissues/products than the standard inorganic source cupric sulphate pentahydrate. No concerns for consumer safety will arise from the use of the additive in animal nutrition, provided that the maximum copper contents authorised in feed are respected. The powder form of <b>copper</b> <b>chelate</b> of L-lysinate-HCl should be considered as a risk by inhalation; exposure by inhalation should be minimised.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} of direct copper precipitation from a loaded chelating extractant using hydrogen in an autoclave (pressure hydrogen stripping) was studied. In its simplest form, {{the reaction is}} given by{CuL(, 2) }(,org) + H(, 2) (g) ( [...] ->) 2 {HL}(,org) + Cu(s). Kelex 100 (Sherex Chemical Co. - commercial solvent extraction reagent), an alkylated derivative of 8 -hydroxyquinoline {{was used as the}} basis of the present investigation and represents HL in the above equation. Two types of experiments were carried out: (a) those designed to study the chemical and thermal response of the extractant at high temperature and hydrogen pressures and (b) those which describe the chemistry and kinetics of hydrogen stripping. The extractant was found to exhibit excellent chemical stability up to 573 K (300 (DEGREES) C) and 2. 76 MPa (400 psi) hydrogen in the absence of copper. Its chemical stability was somewhat reduced when loaded with copper. In the latter case, some limited hydrogenation of the quinoline nucleus of the extractant and some of the impurities present (furoquinolines) was observed. The chemical stability of the extractant was found to be enhanced when at least 0. 52 M of a long-chain alcohol (decanol) was added to the organic solvent (0. 4 M Kelex/kerosene). A slow thermal dissociation of the <b>copper</b> <b>chelate</b> was found to take place within the experimental temperature range studied (443 to 488 K). This resulted in copper precipitation and organic regeneration. Copper in a powder form was found to precipitate rapidly from loaded Kelex 100 /decanol/kerosene solvents by reaction with hydrogen at pressures between 0. 52 and 4. 00 MPa (75 and 580 psi) and temperatures from 443 to 488 K (170 to 215 (DEGREES) C).

30|$|Bishop and Rodgers (2012) found copper {{formulations}} elicited {{significantly different}} responses independent of total sorbed copper amounts. Copper sulfate has a sorption and depuration profile {{that is expected}} to rapidly move to the algae but not effectively internalize for algaecidal effects (Bishop 2016). The sorption kinetics observed by Bishop et al. (2017) in short exposures indicate Captain XTR to have increased ability to penetrate into nuisance algae and achieve internal control thresholds, and are not solely driven by active transport from externally sorbed copper. Interactivity of copper from copper sulfate with water chemistry (e.g., alkalinity; Meyer 1999) and algal cells (Crist et al. 1990) is predicted to rapidly remove copper mass. This would limit the travel distance down a canal, and copper sulfate may not continue to enter the cell to attain internal control thresholds (Bishop et al. 2018). Murray-Gulde et al. (2002) found copper half-lives to be lower with <b>copper</b> sulfate than <b>chelated</b> <b>copper</b> in some natural waters.

40|$|This {{investigation}} studied polarographic {{results obtained}} in the electroreduction of <b>copper</b> <b>chelate</b> derivatives of 2, 4 -pentanedione, 1 -phenyl- 1, 3 butanedione, and 1, 3 -diphenyl- 1, 3 -propanedione in several solvents. This study produced the following results: (1) Polarographic investigations of bis (2, 4 -pentanediono) -copper (II), bis (1, 3 -butanedino) copper (III), and bis (1, 3 -diphenyl- 1, 3 -propanediono) copper (II) were made in water, fifty percent alcohol, fifty and seventy-five percent dioxane, and fifty percent pyridine solutions. (2) The half-wave potentials of these compounds decrease with increasing size of chelating group and {{are affected by the}} solvent. (3) The diffusion current constants in water and alcohol solutions decrease with increasing size of the chelating group. Variations in the trend occur in dioxane solutions. (4) Pyridine solutions of these compounds are believed to give two waves. The first wave is difficult to evaluate because it merges with the anodic wave of mercury. Values are included, therefore, for the second waves only. (5) Electroreduction of these compounds is an irreversible process. Advisor: H. F. Holtzclaw, Jr...|$|E
40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{effect of}} 5 -Aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA) on copper-mediated LDL oxidation was followed {{either by the}} emitted chemiluminiscence (CL) or by UV-vis spectroscopy. 5 -ASA addition extends the lag phase in a concentration-dependent manner without changes {{in the rate of}} the process in the autoaccelerated phase. The antioxidant behavior of 5 -ASA was very similar to that of Trolox, a very efficient water soluble antioxidant. The copper-binding capacity of 5 -ASA was evaluated by UV-visible spectroscopy. The addition of copper to a 5 -ASA solution increases the absorbance at 332 nm and generates a new band at 298 nm. These changes in the UV-vis spectra indicate formation of a complex between 5 -ASA and copper. However, LDL protection by 5 -ASA is unrelated to its <b>copper</b> <b>chelating</b> capacit...|$|R
40|$|Restricted Access. The {{synthesis}} {{and liquid}} crystalline properties of thirty nine compounds are reported. These include a homologous series of N-(2 -hydroxy- 4 -n-alkoxybenzylidene) - 4 ''-n-dodecylphenylanilines and their corresponding copper(II) and palladium(II) complexes. Differential scanning calorimetry and optical microscopy {{were used to}} characterise the mesophases. The Schiff's bases exhibit polymesomorphism while their metal chelates basically show smectic A (SA) and smectic C (Sc) phases {{except for a few}} derivatives. The transition temperatures of the metal chelates are considerably higher than the ligands from which they are derived. A comparison of the mesomorphic properties of the <b>copper</b> <b>chelates</b> with those of bis[4 -(4 -alkoxybcnzoyloxy) -N-(4 -ethoxyphenyl) salicylaldiminato]copper(II) complexes have also been made. Though the melting points of copper(II) and their corresponding palladium(II) chelates of many homologues are comparable, the clearing points of the latter are consistently higher...|$|R
40|$|A {{search in}} a {{database}} of potential bioactive short sequences in food proteins reveals that bioactive peptides {{with a variety of}} beneficial effects for cardiovascular health are present in the sequence of common bean proteins, including bioactive sequences with antioxidant properties. A protein isolate, the storage protein phaseolin and a lectin extract from Phaseolus vulgaris L. var. Jamapa, were hydrolyzed by treatment with pepsin and pancreatin in order to investigate the possible release of peptides with antioxidant and metal chelating properties. Antioxidant activity was determined in Caco- 2 cells exposed to a free radical generator, and iron and <b>copper</b> <b>chelating</b> activities were determined using colorimetric methods. The highest antioxidant activity, 71 % inhibition, was found in the hydrolyzed protein isolate. <b>Copper</b> and iron <b>chelating</b> activities were highest in the lectin and phaseolin hydrolysates, 53 % and 81 %, respectively. Thus, experimental data indicates, as suggested by the database search, that antioxidant peptides are abundant in pepsin-pancreatin hydrolysates, which may represent a valuable health-promoting property in common bean. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
