40|$|Galaxy {{clusters}} can efficiently convert axion-like particles (ALPs) to photons. We {{propose that}} the recently claimed detection of a 3. 55 [...] 3. 57 keV line in the stacked spectra {{of a large number}} of galaxy clusters and the Andromeda galaxy may originate from the decay of either a scalar or fermionic 7. 1 keV dark matter species into an axion-like particle (ALP) of mass m_a≲ 6 · 10 ^- 11 eV, which subsequently converts to a photon in the cluster magnetic field. In contrast to models in which the photon line arises directly from dark matter decay or annihilation, this can explain the anomalous line strength in the Perseus cluster. As axion-photon conversion scales as B^ 2 and cool core clusters have high central magnetic fields, this model can also explains the observed peaking of the line emission in the cool cores of the Perseus, Ophiuchus and <b>Centaurus</b> <b>clusters,</b> as opposed to the much larger dark matter halos.

50|$|The ICM is {{composed}} primarily of ordinary baryons (mainly ionised hydrogen and helium). This plasma is enriched with heavy elements, such as iron. The amount of heavy elements relative to hydrogen, known as metallicity in astronomy, is roughly {{a third of}} the value in the sun. The metallicity rises from the outer region towards the center and in some clusters (e.g. the <b>Centaurus</b> <b>cluster)</b> the metallicity of the gas can rise above that of the sun. Due to the strong gravitational field of clusters, metal-enriched gas ejected during supernovae can remain gravitationally bound to the cluster and become part of the ICM.

Our sample is drawn from a flux-limited catalogue but excludes the Fornax, Coma and <b>Centaurus</b> <b>clusters,</b> owing to their large angular size compared to the Chandra field-of-view. We describe a quantitative measure {{of the impact of}} central cooling, and find that the sample comprises 9 clusters possessing cool cores and 11 without. The properties of these two types differ markedly, but there is a high degree of uniformity amongst the cool core clusters, which obey a nearly universal radial scaling in temperature of the form T ∝ r^ 0. 4, within the core. This uniformity persists in the gas cooling time, which varies more strongly with radius in cool core clusters (t_cool ∝ r^ 1. 3), reaching t_cool < 1 Gyr in all cases, although surprisingly low central cooling times (< 5 Gyr) are found in many of the non-cool core systems. The scatter between the cooling time profiles of all the clusters is found to be remarkably small, implying a universal form for the cooling time of gas at a given physical radius in virialized systems, in agreement with recent previous work.

A distance difference of 0. 48 +/- 0. 21 mag is found between the central galaxies NGC 4696 (Cen 30) and NGC 4709 (Cen 45) of both components, supported by the different turn-over magnitudes of their respective globular cluster systems.

40|$|We present {{analysis}} of local large scale flows using the Surface Brightness Fluctuation (SBF) Survey for the distances to 300 early-type galaxies. Our {{models of the}} distribution function of mean velocity and velocity dispersion at each point in space include a uniform thermal velocity dispersion and spherical attractors whose position, amplitude, and radial shape are free to vary. Our fitting procedure performs a maximum likelihood fit of the model to the observations. We obtain a Hubble constant of Ho = 77 +/- 4 +/- 7 km/s/Mpc, but a uniform Hubble flow is not acceptable fit to the data. Inclusion of two attractors, one of whose fit location coincides with the Virgo cluster and the other whose fit location is slightly beyond the <b>Centaurus</b> <b>clusters</b> nearly explain the peculiar velocities, but {{the quality of the}} fit can be further improved by the addition of a quadrupole correction to the Hubble flow. Although the dipole and quadrupole may be genuine manifestations of more distant density fluctuations, we find evidence that they are more likely due to non-spherical attractors. We find no evidence for bulk flows which include our entire survey volume (R < 3000 km/s); our volume is at rest with respect to the CMB. The fits to the attractors both have isothermal radial profiles (v ~ 1 /r) over a range of overdensity between about 10 and 1, but fall off more steeply at larger radius.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{detection}} of hard X-ray emission components in the spectra of six nearby, giant elliptical galaxies observed with the ASCA satellite. The systems studied, which exhibit strong dynamical evidence for supermassive black holes in their nuclei, are M 87, NGC 1399 and NGC 4696 (the dominant galaxies of the Virgo, Fornax and <b>Centaurus</b> <b>clusters,</b> respectively) and NGC 4472, 4636 and 4649 (three further giant ellipticals in the Virgo cluster). The ASCA data for all six sources provide clear evidence for hard emission components, which can be parameterized by power-law models with photon indices in the range Γ = 0. 6 - 1. 5 (mean value 1. 2) and intrinsic 1 - 10 keV luminosities of 2 × 10 ^ 40 - 2 × 10 ^ 42 erg/s. Our results imply the identification of {{a new class of}} accreting X-ray source, with X-ray spectra significantly harder than those of binary X-ray sources, Seyfert nuclei or low luminosity AGN, and bolometric luminosities relatively dominated by their X-ray emission. We discuss various possible origins for the hard X-ray emission and argue that it is most likely to be due to accretion onto the central supermassive black holes, via low-radiative efficiency accretion coupled with strong outflows. In the case of M 87, our detected power-law flux is in good agreement with a previously-reported measurement from ROSAT High Resolution Imager observations, which were able to resolve the jet from the nuclear X-ray emission components. We confirm previous results showing that the use of multiphase models in the analysis of the ASCA data leads to determinations of approximately solar emission-weighted metallicities for the X-ray gas in the galaxies. We also present results on the individual element abundances in NGC 4636. Comment: MNRAS in press. 15 pages, 3 figures in MNRAS LaTex style. Minor modifications.

40|$|As {{part of our}} {{programme}} to map {{the large-scale}} distribution of galaxies behind the southern Milky Way, we observed 314 optically-selected, partially-obscured galaxies in the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA) in the Crux and Great Attractor (GA) regions. The observations were conducted with the Parkes 64 m radio telescope, in a single-pixel pointed mode, reaching an rms noise level of typically 2 - 6 mJy over the velocity search range of 400 <v< 10500 km/s. A total of 162 galaxies were detected. This {{can be explained by}} the prominence of the GA overdensity in the survey regions, which leads to a relatively higher fraction of nearby galaxies. It is also evident from the quite narrow velocity distribution (largely confined to 3000 - 6000 km/s) and deviates significantly from the expectation of a uniform galaxy distribution for the given sensitivity and velocity range. No systematic differences were found between detections and non-detections, in terms of latitude, foreground extinction, or environment, except for the very central part of the rich Norma cluster, where hardly any galaxies were detected. A detailed investigation of the HI content of the galaxies reveals strong HI deficiency at the core of the Norma cluster (within about a 0. 4 Abell radius), similar to what has been found in the Coma cluster. The redshifts obtained by this observing technique result in a substantial reduction of the so-called redshift ZOA. This is obvious when analysing the large-scale structure of the new HI data in combination with data from optical ZOA redshift surveys. The lower latitude detections provide further evidence of the extension of the Norma Wall, across the ZOA, in particular its bending towards the Cen-Crux clusters above the Galactic plane at slightly higher redshift, rather than a straight continuation towards the <b>Centaurus</b> <b>clusters.</b> Comment: 30 pages, 11 figures, including aa. cls; accepted by A...|$|R
