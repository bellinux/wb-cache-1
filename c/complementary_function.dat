50|$|The usual {{method is}} {{to assume that the}} optical path through the {{instrument}} is optically perfect, convolved with a point spread function (PSF), that is, a mathematical function that describes the distortion in terms of the pathway a theoretical point source of light (or other waves) takes through the instrument. Usually, such a point source contributes a small area of fuzziness to the final image. If this function can be determined, it is then a matter of computing its inverse or <b>complementary</b> <b>function,</b> and convolving the acquired image with that. The result is the original, undistorted image.|$|E
5000|$|While most {{acoustic}} tweezers {{are able}} to manipulate {{a large number of}} objects at once, a <b>complementary</b> <b>function</b> is to selectively manipulate one object within a cluster of identical ones. This requires specific acoustic fields. Single beam tweezers have been developed in this aim, based either on highly focused acoustic beams [...] or bessel beams. Alternatively, nanosecond-scale pulsed fields can be used to selectively generate localized acoustic standing waves. Manipulation of small objects in aqueous solutions is achieved by dipping the transducer in the fluid. Non-invasive methods using spiral-shaped interdigitated transducers have also been proposed. In this case, the transducer is flat and is placed below the sample. This type of device allows patterning dozens of microscopic particles on a microscope slide.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study the second-order {{statistical}} moment functions that characterizes complex-valued harmonizable processes. A real-valued harmonizable process has four Hermitian second-order functions. These functions are equivalent {{representations of the}} second-order statistical quantities of the process. For a complex-valued harmonizable process, however, we need the <b>complementary</b> <b>functions</b> {{in addition to the}} Hermitian functions to completely describe the second-order statistical behavior of the process. We define and discuss the Hermitian and the <b>complementary</b> <b>functions</b> of complex-valued harmonizable processes. Exact expressions for the Hermitian and <b>complementary</b> second-order moment <b>functions</b> for some important sub-classes of complex-valued harmonizable processes are derived and discussed. We introduce, test, and characterize numerical estimators of these functions. Numerically generated data, and a real-world earthquake data set, are employed to demonstrate that the estimators work in practice. Based on the concept of widely linear mean square estimation, we propose a novel generalized measure of coherence for harmonizable random processes. This measure generalizes a recently proposed measure of coherence based on linear mean square estimation. Finally, we argue that our alternative coherence measure may in fact be beneficial for most nonstationary processes, even for real-valued harmonizable processes...|$|R
