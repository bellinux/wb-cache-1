5|$|After {{the devastating}} bombing of Rotterdam by the Luftwaffe, the Germans {{threatened}} to bomb other Dutch cities if the Dutch forces refused to surrender. The General Staff knew it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> the bombers {{and ordered the}} Dutch army to cease hostilities. The last occupied parts of the Netherlands were liberated in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their strong}} first half {{up to that}} point, Bolton went a goal behind in the 37th minute. Liverpool midfielder Steve McManaman {{received}} the ball from John Barnes, he ran past Bolton defender Alan Stubbs, then past Scott Green. His subsequent shot was not powerful, but Bolton goalkeeper Keith Branagan <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> the ball from going into the goal, giving Liverpool a 1–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactic of}} {{continuous}} forward patrolling {{was so successful}} that the advancing force's every move was known to the defenders, but the light horsemen were substantially outnumbered and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> the advance. By daylight on 3 August, the German, Austrian and Ottoman force had occupied Katia and were {{within striking distance of}} Romani, Dueidar, Hill 70 and the Suez Canal. Their line ran north-east and south-west from the Bardawil Lagoon to east of Katia, with their left flank thrown well forward.|$|E

5|$|Irish {{merchant}} shipping {{saw to it}} that vital imports continued to arrive and exports, mainly food supplies to Great Britain, were delivered. Irish ships sailed unarmed and usually alone, identifying themselves as neutrals with bright lights and by painting the Irish tricolour and EIRE in large letters on their sides and decks. Nonetheless twenty percent of seamen serving in Irish ships perished, victims of a war not their own: attacked by both sides, though predominantly by the Axis powers. Often, Allied convoys <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> to pick up survivors, while Irish ships always answered SOS signals and stopped to rescue survivors, irrespective of which side they belonged to. Irish ships rescued 534 seamen.|$|E
5|$|Penelo {{is usually}} {{trying to keep}} Vaan out of trouble, but she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> Vaan from intruding into the palace grounds. She {{encountered}} Vaan, who was arrested along with Balthier and Fran. This encounter forced her {{into a series of}} events, when she was kidnapped by Bangaa headhunter Ba'gamnan and held as hostage in exchange for Balthier. When she managed to escape, she met with Larsa Solidor, one of the sons of Archadian Emperor Gramis, who took care of her and convinced her he wished to make peace with Dalmasca. When she is finally reunited with Vaan, she made him promise not to leave her side, and ever since traveled with Vaan, furthering their relationship as sky pirate and partner.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their best}} efforts to control Viet Cong {{activities}} across the river in the Thu Thiem area, the South Vietnamese military and police <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> Viet Cong agents from operating there. So Viet Cong members of the 65th Special Operations Group were able to watch U.S. and South Vietnamese military activities at the port, while they were preparing to attack American targets. Lam Son Nao, a commando of the 65th Special Operations Group, was also an employee at the port facility. As his unit was assigned with the mission to attack the American escort carrier, Nao took advantage of his position as an employee at the port facility, to reconnoitre Card to design the best strategy to sabotage the ship and all the military hardware on board. Nao’s father had previously worked at the port facility as a tradesman, so he memorised all the underground tunnels and sewerage systems which ran {{in and out of}} the facility. He advised Nao that the best way to enter the area where the American ships normally anchored, was via the sewer tunnel opposite Thu Thiem.|$|E

5|$|During the 2006–07 season, manager Colin Todd {{had been}} sacked {{because of a}} poor run of results. Club captain David Wetherall was {{originally}} appointed Todd's successor on a caretaker basis, before being handed the role {{until the end of}} the season, during the following month. Wetherall <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> City's run of poor form, and the club were relegated to League Two on 28 April 2007 after a 3–0 defeat at Chesterfield. It was the club's third relegation in seven seasons, and meant the 2007–08 season would be their first season in the fourth division of English football in 25years. On 22 May 2007, former City player Stuart McCall, who had played more than 400games for the club during two previous spells, was announced as the club's new manager to take over on 1 June 2007. Although the club had just 13players with first-team experience, the bookmakers made City second favourites to win the League Two title.|$|E
5|$|Kieftenbeld {{was twice}} shortlisted for the Eredivisie's annual Maatschappelijk Speler (Community Player) award, which {{brings with it}} a €50,000 prize to be donated to a social project of the winner's choice. He was {{actively}} involved with Kids United, a football team for children with disabilities. Although he did not win on either occasion, his charity still benefited when the 2015 winner, Jeroen Zoet, shared the prize money {{with the other two}} nominees. In late July 2015, English club Birmingham City made a bid for Kieftenbeld's services that triggered the release clause in his contract. Although Groningen accepted they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> him leaving, they were disappointed not just at losing their captain so soon {{before the start of the}} new season, but at losing a player who did so much for the club in the community.|$|E
5|$|Sivanandam interrogates Usha, {{who tells}} him {{how she and}} Rajan fell in love. Sivanandam tricks Usha into using a leaky {{fountain}} pen in order to collect her fingerprints. That evening, he and Naidu meet all of the suspects at Rajan's house. Sivanandam carries out an exercise in which the suspectsincluding Ushamust pretend he is Rajan and shoot him using revolvers loaded with fake bullets. All the suspects shoot him except Usha, who bursts into tears. Sivanandam then demands to have Pattabi and Hema arrested, until Usha reveals the truth: Rajan was a radio engineer who wanted to sell radios to the poor at an affordable price. Unable to get any support from the government, he went to Japan where his work was appreciated. He became a spy selling India's military secrets to Japan. Usha learnt about this and tried unsuccessfully to reform him. She <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> him and attempted to shoot him. She changed her mind but pulled the trigger accidentally, killing him. After revealing the truth, Usha commits suicide.|$|E

5|$|In {{his senior}} season, the Vols {{opened the season}} with {{victories}} against Texas Tech and UCLA, but {{for the third time}} in his career, Manning fell to Florida 33–20. The Vols won the rest of their regular season games, finishing 10–1, and advanced to the SEC Championship game against Auburn. Down 20–7 in the second quarter, Manning led the Vols to a 30–29 comeback victory. Throwing for four touchdowns, he was named the game's MVP, but injured himself in the process. The #3 Vols were matched-up with #2 Nebraska in the Orange Bowl; if Tennessee won and top-ranked Michigan lost to Washington State in the Rose Bowl, the Vols would have won the national championship. However, the Vols' defense <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> Nebraska's rushing attack, giving up over 400rushing yards in a 42–17 loss. As a senior, Manning won numerous awards; he was a consensus first-team All-American, the Maxwell Award winner, the Davey O'Brien Award winner, the Johnny Unitas Award winner, and the Best College Player ESPY award winner, among others. In 2005, Tennessee retired Manning's number (No. 16). One of the streets leading to Neyland Stadium has been renamed Peyton Manning Pass. While at the University of Tennessee, Manning excelled academically and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa Society in 1997 and awarded the National Football Foundation National Scholar-Athlete Award.|$|E
5|$|On January 18, 2001, the Jets {{announced}} Herman Edwards {{as the new}} coach. Edwards, {{a former}} defensive back who had {{worked his way up}} through the NFL coaching system, had never served as head coach at any level. He was the first African-American Jets head coach. Edwards lost his first game, two days before the September 11 attacks. In the wake of 9/11, the NFL had to decide whether to play its games the following weekend. Testaverde and the Jets spoke out against playing on the weekend after 9/11, and the Jets were prepared to forfeit the game rather than fly. The NFL decided to move that week's games {{to the end of the}} regular season. The Jets needed to win that game, in Oakland against the Raiders, to reach the playoffs, and John Hall kicked a last-minute 53-yard field goal for a 24–22 victory and a playoff berth. Edwards was the first coach to lead the Jets to the playoffs in his first year with the team. In the playoffs, the Jets again played at Oakland. New York <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> the Raiders' passing game, and Oakland won, 38–24.|$|E
5|$|While {{three of}} the four Ju 87 groups reached and bombed their targets without interception, the 28 Stukas of I./StG 77 were {{attacked}} by No. 43 and 601 Squadron sporting a force of 18 Hurricanes. The escorting Bf 109s from II./JG 27 were flying too far away and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> the Hurricanes making an attack before the Ju 87s made their dives. Three Ju 87s were shot down in exchange for a damaged Hurricane, hit by return fire. The Bf 109s soon came under attack themselves and could not assist the dive-bombers effectively. Still, some Ju 87s made attacks. While they were doing so, some of the German crews saw No. 235 Blenheims taking off to defend their base. Some hangars were hit by the Ju 87s and much damage done. As the Bf 109 escorts turned to meet the two engaging RAF Squadrons, around 300 aircraft filled a patch of sky 25 miles long, from Gosport to Bognor Regis. No. 152, 235 Squadrons engaged the Germans over Thorney Island. No. 602 engaged the Ju 87s that attacked Ford but III./JG 27 bounced No. 602 Squadron, claiming four Spitfires destroyed. Spitfires from No. 234 and Hurricanes from 213 Squadron each destroyed one Bf 109.|$|E

5|$|In the {{northern}} {{section of the}} fort, similar actions were taking place, as the airborne troops raced to destroy or otherwise disable the fortifications housing artillery pieces. Objective No. 13 was a casemate housing multiple machine-guns whose arcs of fire covered {{the western side of}} the Fort; to destroy the casemate, the airborne troops used a flamethrower to force the Belgian soldiers manning the weapons to retreat, and then detonated shaped charges against the fortification to disable it. Another observation cupola fitted with machine-guns, Objective No. 19, was destroyed, but two further objectives, Nos. 15 and 16 were found to be dummy installations. Unexpected complications came from Objective No. 23, a retractable cupola housing two 75mm artillery pieces. It had been assumed that the weapons in this fortification <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> the airborne assault, but this assumption was found to be false when the weapons opened fire, forcing the airborne troops in the area to go to cover. The rapid fire of the weapons led to air support being summoned, and a Stuka squadron bombed the cupola. Although the bombs did not destroy the cupola, the explosions did force the Belgians to retract it {{throughout the rest of the}} fighting. Any exterior entrances and exits located by the airborne troops were destroyed with explosives to seal the garrison inside the Fort, giving the garrison few opportunities to attempt a counter-attack. The airborne troops had achieved their initial objective of destroying or disabling the artillery pieces that the fort could have used to bombard the captured bridges, but they still faced a number of small cupolas and emplacements that had to be disabled. A number of these included anti-aircraft weapons and machine-guns.|$|E
