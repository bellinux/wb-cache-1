5|$|Twenty-two {{amino acids}} are {{naturally}} incorporated into polypeptides and are called proteinogenic or natural amino acids. Of these, 20 are encoded by the universal genetic code. The remaining 2, selenocysteine and pyrrolysine, {{are incorporated into}} proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms. Selenocysteine is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes a SECIS element, which causes the UGA <b>codon</b> to encode selenocysteine instead of a stop <b>codon.</b> Pyrrolysine is used by some methanogenic archaea in enzymes that they use to produce methane. It is coded for with the <b>codon</b> UAG, which is normally a stop <b>codon</b> in other organisms. This UAG <b>codon</b> {{is followed by a}} PYLIS downstream sequence.|$|E
5|$|Given the non-random genetic triplet coding scheme, a tenable {{hypothesis}} for {{the origin}} of genetic code could address multiple aspects of the <b>codon</b> table, such as absence of codons for D-amino acids, secondary <b>codon</b> patterns for some amino acids, confinement of synonymous positions to third position, the small set of only 20 amino acids (instead of a number approaching 64), and the relation of stop <b>codon</b> patterns to amino acid coding patterns.|$|E
5|$|This was {{followed}} by experiments in Severo Ochoa's laboratory that demonstrated that the poly-adenine RNA sequence (AAAAA...) coded for the polypeptide poly-lysine and that the poly-cytosine RNA sequence (CCCCC...) coded for the polypeptide poly-proline. Therefore, the <b>codon</b> AAA specified the amino acid lysine, and the <b>codon</b> CCC specified the amino acid proline. Using various copolymers {{most of the remaining}} codons were then determined.|$|E
50|$|This method removes {{redundant}} <b>codons</b> {{and stop}} <b>codons.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{frequencies}} of 2 -aminopurine- and 5 -bromouracil-induced A:T → G:C transitions were compared at nonsense sites throughout the rII region of bacteriophage T 4. These frequencies are influenced both by adjacent base pairs within the nonsense <b>codons</b> and by extracodonic factors. Following 2 AP treatment, they {{are high in}} amber (UAG) and lower in opal (UGA) <b>codons</b> than in allelic ochre (UAA) <b>codons.</b> In general, 5 BU-induced transitions are more frequent in both amber and opal <b>codons</b> than in the allelic ochre <b>codons.</b> 2 AP- and 5 BU-induced transition frequencies {{in the first and}} third positions of opal <b>codons</b> are correlated with those in the corresponding positions of the allelic ochre <b>codons.</b> Similarly, the {{frequencies of}} 2 AP-induced transition in the first and second positions of amber <b>codons</b> and their ochre alleles are correlated. However, there is little correlation between the frequencies of 5 BU-induced transitions in the first and second positions of allelic amber and ochre <b>codons...</b>|$|R
50|$|The helicase domains A, B and C {{are found}} between <b>codons</b> 1460 and 1575. The 3C {{protease}} domains span <b>codons</b> 2183 to 2327. The usual eight RdRp domains are located between <b>codons</b> 2493 and 2828.|$|R
5|$|H. Murakami and M. Sisido {{extended}} some codons to {{have four}} and five bases. Steven A. Benner constructed a functional 65th (in vivo) <b>codon.</b>|$|E
5|$|In as {{different}} groups as animals and trypanosomes, the mitochondria contain both stabilising and destabilising poly(A) tails. Destabilising polyadenylation targets both mRNA and noncoding RNAs. The poly(A) tails are 43 nucleotides long on average. The stabilising ones {{start at the}} stop <b>codon,</b> and without them the stop <b>codon</b> (UAA) is not complete as the genome only encodes the U or UA part. Plant mitochondria have only destabilising polyadenylation, and yeast mitochondria have no polyadenylation at all.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has led to}} <b>codon</b> assignments of {{the genetic}} code that minimize the effects of mutations. A recent hypothesis suggests that the triplet code was derived from codes that used longer than triplet codons (such as quadruplet codons). Longer than triplet decoding would increase <b>codon</b> redundancy and would be more error resistant. This feature could allow accurate decoding absent complex translational machinery such as the ribosome, such as before cells began making ribosomes.|$|E
50|$|There are 2 open reading frames: ORF1—770 <b>codons</b> in length—and ORF2—202 <b>codons</b> in length.|$|R
40|$|The {{precision}} {{with which}} individual termination <b>codons</b> in mRNA are recognized by protein release factors (RFs) has been measured and {{compared with the}} decoding of sense <b>codons</b> by tRNA. An Escherichia coli system for protein synthesis in vitro with purified components was used to study the accuracy of termination by RF 1 and RF 2 in {{the presence or absence}} of RF 3. The efficiency of factor-dependent termination at all sense <b>codons</b> differing from any of the three stop <b>codons</b> by a single mutation was measured and compared with the efficiency of termination at the three stop <b>codons.</b> RF 1 and RF 2 discriminate against sense <b>codons</b> related to stop <b>codons</b> by between 3 and more than 6 orders of magnitude. This high level of accuracy is obtained without energy-driven error correction (proofreading), in contrast to codon-dependent aminoacyl-tRNA recognition by ribosomes. Two <b>codons,</b> UAU and UGG, stand out as hotspots for RF-dependent premature termination...|$|R
5000|$|Although these stop <b>codons</b> are {{triplets}} {{just like}} ordinary <b>codons,</b> {{they are not}} decoded by tRNAs. It was discovered by Mario Capecchi in 1967 that, instead, tRNAs do not ordinarily recognize stop <b>codons</b> at all, and that what he named [...] "release factor" [...] was not a tRNA molecule but a protein. Later, it was demonstrated that different release factors recognize different stop <b>codons.</b>|$|R
5|$|Some {{of these}} {{differences}} {{should be regarded as}} pseudo-changes in the genetic code due to the phenomenon of RNA editing, which is common in mitochondria. In higher plants, it was thought that CGG encoded for tryptophan and not arginine; however, the <b>codon</b> in the processed RNA was discovered to be the UGG <b>codon,</b> consistent with the standard genetic code for tryptophan. Of note, the arthropod mitochondrial genetic code has undergone parallel evolution within a phylum, with some organisms uniquely translating AGG to lysine.|$|E
5|$|Surprisingly, {{variations}} {{in the interpretation of}} the genetic code exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying the translation of malate dehydrogenase found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the stop <b>codon</b> is naturally used to encode the amino acids tryptophan and arginine. This type of recoding is induced by a high-readthrough stop <b>codon</b> context and it is referred to as functional translational readthrough.|$|E
5|$|The Crick, Brenner et al. {{experiment}} first {{demonstrated that}} codons consist of three DNA bases. Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrich J. Matthaei {{were the first}} to reveal the nature of a <b>codon</b> in 1961.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, a [...] "start codon", {{and three}} [...] "stop codons" [...] {{indicate}} {{the beginning and}} end of the protein coding region. There are 64possible <b>codons</b> (four possible nucleotides at each of three positions, hence 43possible <b>codons)</b> and only 20standard amino acids; hence the code is redundant and multiple <b>codons</b> can specify the same amino acid. The correspondence between <b>codons</b> and amino acids is nearly universal among all known living organisms.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 {{the group}} of Jason W. Chin {{presented}} a further optimized version of the orthogonal ribosome. The Ribo-Q is a 16S rRNA optimized to recognize tRNAs, which have quadruplet anti-codons to recognize quadruplet <b>codons,</b> instead of the natural triplet <b>codons.</b> With this approach the number of possible <b>codons</b> rises from 64 to 256. Even accounting {{for a variety of}} stop <b>codons,</b> more than 200 different amino acids could potentially be encoded this way.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, a [...] "start codon", {{and three}} [...] "stop codons" [...] {{indicate}} {{the beginning and}} end of the protein coding region. There are 64 possible <b>codons</b> (four possible nucleotides at each of three positions, hence 43 possible <b>codons)</b> and only 20 standard amino acids; hence the code is redundant and multiple <b>codons</b> can specify the same amino acid. The correspondence between <b>codons</b> and amino acids is nearly universal among all known living organisms.|$|R
5|$|The DNA <b>codon</b> {{table is}} {{essentially}} {{identical to that}} for RNA, but with U replaced by T.|$|E
5|$|The code defines how {{sequences}} of nucleotide triplets, called codons, specify which amino acid {{will be added}} next during protein synthesis. With some exceptions, a three-nucleotide <b>codon</b> in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid. The vast majority of genes are encoded with a single scheme (see the RNA <b>codon</b> table). That scheme {{is often referred to}} as the canonical or standard genetic code, or simply the genetic code, though variant codes (such as in human mitochondria) exist.|$|E
5|$|Translation is {{the process}} by which a mature mRNA {{molecule}} is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein. Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds. The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the <b>codon</b> it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary <b>codon.</b> When the tRNA binds to its complementary <b>codon</b> in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus. During and after synthesis, most new proteins must fold to their active three-dimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{genetic code}} is {{composed}} of three-nucleotide <b>codons,</b> thus producing 64 different <b>codons.</b> Since only 20 amino acids are used, multiple <b>codons</b> code for the same amino acids. This structure is arbitrary and shared by all eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Archaea and mitochondria use a similar code with minor differences.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Sample {{sequence}} showing {{three different}} possible reading frames. Start <b>codons</b> are highlighted in purple, and stop <b>codons</b> are highlighted in red.|$|R
5000|$|The first ancient <b>codons</b> were GGC and GCC {{from which}} the other <b>codons</b> have been derived by series of point mutations. Nowadays, {{we can see it}} in modern genes as [...] "mini-genes" [...] {{containing}} a purine at the middle position in the <b>codons</b> alternating with segments having a pyrimidine in the middle nucleotides.|$|R
5|$|Since 2001, 40 non-natural {{amino acids}} {{have been added}} into protein by {{creating}} a unique <b>codon</b> (recoding) and a corresponding transfer-RNA:aminoacyl– tRNA-synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties {{in order to be}} used as a tool to exploring protein structure and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins.|$|E
5|$|Stereochemical {{affinity}}: {{the genetic}} code {{is a result of}} a high affinity between each amino acid and its <b>codon</b> or anti-codon; the latter option implies that pre-tRNA molecules matched their corresponding amino acids by this affinity. Later during evolution, this matching was gradually replaced with matching by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.|$|E
5|$|They used a {{cell-free}} {{system to}} translate a poly-uracil RNA sequence (i.e., UUUUU...) {{and discovered that}} the polypeptide that they had synthesized consisted of only the amino acid phenylalanine. They thereby deduced that the <b>codon</b> UUU specified the amino acid phenylalanine.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a foolproof method to substitute a stretch of residues by alanines. After the introduction of aPstI site by IPCR, thus creating two alanine <b>codons,</b> additional <b>codons</b> are introduced at this site {{through the use of}} an 'alanine-stretch cartridge'. These cartridges comprise an antibiotic resistance gene flanked on both sides by alanine <b>codons.</b> Excision of the resistance gene byPvuII then yields the correct insertion of <b>codons.</b> The method is both highly reliable and flexible and should be of general use...|$|R
50|$|Further, {{there may}} be a bias in which certain <b>codons</b> are {{preferred}} in a gene, as a certain combination of <b>codons</b> may improve translational efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Mitochondrial {{genes in}} some {{vertebrates}} (including humans) have incomplete stop <b>codons</b> ending in U or UA, which become complete termination <b>codons</b> (UAA) upon subsequent polyadenylation.|$|R
5|$|Transfer RNA (tRNA) {{is a small}} RNA {{chain of}} about 80 {{nucleotides}} that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation. It has sites for amino acid attachment and an anticodon region for <b>codon</b> recognition that binds to a specific sequence on the messenger RNA chain through hydrogen bonding.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{that share}} the same biosynthetic pathway tend {{to have the same}} first base in their codons. This could be an {{evolutionary}} relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids. It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the <b>codon</b> during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{replication}} is for {{the most}} part extremely accurate, however errors (mutations) do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10−3. This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a <b>codon</b> to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop <b>codon).</b> Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when repairing physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, is more important to survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing double-strand breaks.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{numerous}} <b>codons</b> within an mRNA transcript, {{and it is}} very common for an amino acid to be specified by more than one codon; this phenomenon is called degeneracy. [...] In all, there are 64 <b>codons,</b> 61 of each code for one of the 20 amino acids, while the remaining <b>codons</b> specify chain termination.|$|R
40|$|Thus, a {{rapid rate}} of change alone does not explain why change at the set of {{positively}} selected <b>codons</b> appears to be adaptive. Conclusion We have identified a small set of rapidly evolv-ing <b>codons</b> in the HA 1 domain of the hemag-glutinin gene of human influenza A subtype H 3 in which replacement substitutions in the past {{appear to have been}} selectively advantageous. Strains with more mutations in these <b>codons</b> {{were more likely to be}} the progenitors of suc-cessful new lineages in 9 of 11 influenza sea-sons. The probability of obtaining a successful test by chance varied across years. However, our method produced successful tests in many years, such as 1993 – 1994, when it was highly unlikely to do so. A causal explanation for our results is suggested by the significant overlap between the positively selected <b>codons</b> and the <b>codons</b> in or near antibody combining sites A or B and, to a lesser extent, <b>codons</b> associated with the sialic acid receptor binding site. However, <b>codons</b> associated with these sites of known function that are not under positive selection perform poorly in the prediction tests. The pos-itively selected <b>codons</b> are among the most quickly evolving in the HA 1 domain of hem-agglutinin, but this characteristic also is not a sufficient explanation for our results. It appears that we have identified a subset of rapidly evolving <b>codons</b> in known functional sites for which change in the past has been associated with a clear selective advantage. Whether addi-tional changes in these <b>codons</b> will confer a selective advantage in the future remains to be seen. Our retrospective tests indicate that, had these data been available in the past, monitoring change in the positively selected <b>codons</b> might have provided potentially useful information about the course of influenza evolution. These methods can be used to examine the evolution of the hemagglutinins of influenza B and influ-enza A H 1 viruses circulating in humans to identify sets of positively selected <b>codons</b> that may have predictive value for these important pathogens...|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{the entire}} field of {{synthetic}} biology began with researchers such as Erik T. Kool, where bases other than A, C, T and G {{are used in}} a synthetic DNA. In addition to synthetic DNA there are also attempts to construct synthetic <b>codons,</b> synthetic endonucleases, synthetic proteins and synthetic zinc fingers. Using synthetic DNA, instead of there being 43 <b>codons,</b> if there are n new bases there could {{be as many as}} n3 <b>codons.</b> Research is currently being done to see if <b>codons</b> can be expanded to more than 3 bases. These new <b>codons</b> can code for new amino acids. These synthetic molecules can be used not only in medicine, but in creation of new materials.|$|R
