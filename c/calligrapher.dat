5|$|Bembo's italic is {{not based}} {{directly}} {{on the work of}} Griffo, but on the work of <b>calligrapher</b> and handwriting teacher Giovanni Antonio Tagliente (sometimes written Giovannantonio). He published a writing manual, The True Art of Excellent Writing, in Venice in 1524, after the time of Manutius and Griffo, with engravings and some text set in an italic typeface presumably based on his calligraphy. (Tagliente did not only publish on handwriting, but also self-help guides on learning to read, arithmetic, embroidery and a book of model love letters.) It too was imitated in France, with imitations appearing from 1528 onwards. Another influential italic type created around this time was that of Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi, also a <b>calligrapher</b> who became involved in printing. His almost upright italic design was also imitated in France and would also become influential to twentieth-century font designs.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{was buried}} {{according}} to her wishes, but her tombstone was moved from the floor to a wall of Ara Coeli during works on {{the interior of the}} church in 1590. The original epitaph was destroyed at that time, but the Roman <b>calligrapher</b> Giovanni Battista Palatino had recorded it in 1545 and published two years later. It was uniquely bilingual and digraphic, written both in Latin language and script and in Bosnian language and Cyrillic. Only the Latin epitaph was restored, and can be found on her tombstone today.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, THSRC co-organized the “One Word Maxim– Trustworthiness” {{exhibition}} {{together with}} renowned <b>calligrapher</b> Dong Yang-zi at the THSR Taichung Station. On public display {{was an enormous}} 2 meter tall by 3 meter wide calligraphy sculpture created by Ms. Dong using naturally weathered wood from Taiwan. This is the first calligraphy sculpture in Taiwan that allows the spirit of calligraphy and the connotation of words to transcend {{the constraints of the}} writing brush, and its cultural and artistic significance enriched Taichung Station as well as the journeys of passengers transiting through the station.|$|E
50|$|On his {{influences}}, Alhabeeb states: “My strong {{influences and}} inspirations were the towering talents of {{several generations of}} magnificent <b>calligraphers</b> and their distinct styles. The {{most important of these}} influences have been the <b>calligraphers</b> of the contemporary Baghdadi School spearheaded by Hashim Muhammad Al-Khattat Al-Baghdadi, and the earlier Ottoman School, represented by Sheikh Hamadullah Al-Amasi and a bunch of innovative star <b>calligraphers</b> who followed him.|$|R

5|$|Mercator {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the Flemish school of {{cartography}} and is widely considered as the most notable representative of the school in its golden age (16th and 17th centuries). In his own day he was the world's most famous geographer but, in addition, he had interests in theology, philosophy, history, mathematics and magnetism as well as being an accomplished engraver, <b>calligrapher</b> and maker of globes and scientific instruments.|$|E
5|$|Monotype created Bembo {{during a}} period of renewed {{interest}} in the printing of the Italian Renaissance, under the influence of Monotype executive and printing historian Stanley Morison. It followed a previous more faithful revival of Manutius's work, Poliphilus, whose reputation it largely eclipsed. Monotype also created a second, much more eccentric italic for it to the design of <b>calligrapher</b> Alfred Fairbank, which also did not receive the same attention as the normal version of Bembo.|$|E
5|$|Ray {{directed}} 36 films, including feature films, documentaries and shorts. He {{was also}} a fiction writer, publisher, illustrator, <b>calligrapher,</b> music composer, graphic designer and film critic. He authored several short stories and novels, meant primarily for young children and teenagers. Feluda, the sleuth, and Professor Shonku, the scientist in his science fiction stories, are popular fictional characters created by him. He was awarded an honorary degree by Oxford University.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} National Treasures {{writings}} {{that do not}} fit {{in any of the}} above categories, all originating in China. Two are 7th century works: a copy of the Thousand Character Classic by Zhi Yong both in formal and cursive scripts, and a tracing copy of a letter by the famous Chinese <b>calligrapher</b> Wang Xizhi. The former work {{is said to have been}} imported to Japan by the legendary scholar Wani in ancient times. One is a 13th-century set of large-scale letters (2 or 3 each) to be displayed on walls or above doorways.|$|E
5|$|An emaki of Murasaki Shikibu's diary is {{mentioned}} in the Meigetsuki ("Record of the clean moon"), the diary of the poet and scholar Fujiwara no Teika. According to this document, in 1233 several aristocrats close to cloistered Emperor Go-Horikawa planned {{to create a new}} emaki of The Tale of Genji (after the 12th century Genji Monogatari Emaki, the best known of these works), accompanied by another of Murasaki's diary. However, there is no conclusive evidence that the extant scrolls correspond to those mentioned by Fujiwara no Teika, even though the consistency of manufacturing dates suggests that this is the case. The paintings of the emaki have been attributed to the painter Fujiwara Nobuzane and the captions to the excellent <b>calligrapher</b> Gokyōgoku (後京極良経, 1169–1206), despite definitive evidence.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} notable for {{borrowing}} extensively from East Asian art and mythology for its universe, and employed cultural consultants Edwin Zane and <b>calligrapher</b> Siu-Leung Lee {{to help determine}} its art direction and settings. Its character designs are influenced by Chinese art and history, Hinduism, Taoism and Buddhism, and Yoga. The series' music and sound were composed by Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn, who experimented {{with a wide range}} of different instruments, including the guzheng, pipa, and duduk, to create music and sounds that matched the Asiatic-influenced setting of the show. The art style of the various fictitious locations visited throughout the series are based on real locations in Asia. Notably, sites such as the Forbidden City and the Great Wall of China in Beijing were inspirations for the Earth Kingdom city of Ba Sing Se in the show.|$|E

25|$|Japanese {{calligraphy}} {{was influenced}} by, and influenced, Zen thought. For any {{particular piece of}} paper, the <b>calligrapher</b> has but one chance to create with the brush. The brush strokes cannot be corrected, and even a lack of confidence {{shows up in the}} work. The <b>calligrapher</b> must concentrate and be fluid in execution. The brush writes a statement about the <b>calligrapher</b> at a moment in time (see Hitsuzendō, the Zen way of the brush). Through Zen, Japanese calligraphy absorbed a distinct Japanese aesthetic often symbolised by the ensō or circle of enlightenment.|$|E

25|$|How {{the brush}} is held {{depends on the}} <b>calligrapher</b> and which calligraphic genre is practiced. Commonly, the brush is held {{vertically}} straight gripped between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger lightly touches {{the upper part of}} the shaft of the brush (stabilizing it) while the ring and little fingers tuck under the bottom of the shaft, leaving a space inside the palm. Alternatively, the brush is held in the right hand between the thumb and the index finger, very much like a Western pen. A <b>calligrapher</b> may change his or her grip depending on the style and script. For example, a <b>calligrapher</b> may grip higher for cursive and lower for regular script.|$|E
