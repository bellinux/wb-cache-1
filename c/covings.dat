And he streamlined the throat, or in his words [...] "rounded off the breast" [...] so as to [...] "remove those local hindrances which forcibly prevent the smoke from following its natural tendency to go up the chimney..." ...|$|E

The nave roof has a ceiling, the painted imitation-plasterwork in the <b>covings</b> being of interest, believed to be 18th century work. During the last restoration, the plaster ceilings in the chancel and the remaining south transept were removed, exposing roof timbers from the 15th century.|$|E

Let X be a regular proper arithmetic surface and let Y be the support of divisor on X. Let CH_ 0 (X,Y) denote the relative Chow group of zero cycles and let π̃_ 1 ^t(X,Y) ^ ab denote the abelianized modified tame fundamental group of (X,Y) (which classifies finite etale abelian <b>covings</b> of X-Y which are tamely ramified along Y and in which every real point splits completely). THEOREM: There exists a natural reciprocity isomorphism rec: CH_ 0 (X,Y) [...] > π̃_ 1 ^t(X,Y) ^ab. Both groups are finite. Comment: 32 page...|$|E
