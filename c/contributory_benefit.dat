40|$|The basic state {{retirement}} pension is payable irrespective of means {{but it is a}} <b>contributory</b> <b>benefit,</b> not a universal benefit. Individuals who do not have enough National Insurance contributions when they reach state pension age are not entitled to a full state pension. They may receive a proportion of the pension or just the dependant’s addition to a spouse’s pension. This reflects the fact that the pension system in the UK, and the system of unemployment and sickness benefits, were designed around the contributory principle. As Dilnot, Kay and Morris (1984) pointed out in their comprehensive review of social security policy, ‘The Beveridge report took the contributory principle extremely seriously. Contributions were to be levied on an actuarially calculated basis to reflect the benefits received’. But ‘the retreat from this principle has been comprehensive [...] . The National Insurance fund was reduced to meaningless accounting and the actuarial link between contributions and benefits abandoned’. In this strong sense, we have never operated a contributory principle. ...|$|E

30|$|Non <b>contributory,</b> non means-tested <b>benefits</b> are {{generally}} redistributive but their contribution is small. They reduce inequality most in Luxembourg and Hungary {{and have an}} above average impact on inequality in the UK, Slovakia, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden and Austria. Finally, <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> have the least potential to affect inequality. Their effect at the margin is closest to zero (Denmark, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands are exceptions). This is perhaps not surprising given they generally replace market incomes in special contingencies.|$|R
30|$|Contrary to the {{literature}} on regime types (Esping-Andersen 1990; Korpi and Palme 1998), {{there appears to be}} no systematic relationship between the various types of non-pension benefit instruments. The country-level correlation between the size of means-tested benefits and other non-pension benefits (as a percentage of disposable income) is low and actually positive (0.15). Similarly, there is no systematic pattern linking the relative size of means-tested benefits to that of <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits.</b> The country level correlation between the sizes of these two elements of the tax benefit system is 0.03. However, there appears to be a mild and positive correlation between contributory and non-contributory non means-tested benefits (the country level correlation is 0.33) suggesting that countries with higher <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> also have higher non-contributory non-means-tested ones, possibly due to a higher general generosity of the welfare system.|$|R
50|$|The Spanish {{unemployment}} benefits system {{is part of}} the Social security system of Spain. Benefits are managed by the State Public Employment Agency (SEPE).The basis for entitlement is having contributed for a minimum period during the time preceding unemployment, with further conditions that may be applicable. The system comprises <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> and non-contributory benefits.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} correct these problems; {{individuals}} who were simulated to receive assistance benefits but not eligible under the precise rules were given eligibility for <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> and a corresponding number of those with insurance benefits were given eligibility for assistance benefits. A second iteration of the tax-benefit system was then {{used to calculate the}} value.|$|R
30|$|EUROMOD simulates policy {{instruments}} in detail. They {{can be classified}} into four types of policies, namely social insurance contributions, direct income taxes and their sub-components, means-tested benefits and some types of non-means-tested benefits. With some exceptions, pensions and other <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> are not simulated due to absence of information on contribution histories in the input dataset. Instead, the values of these income variables are taken directly from the data.|$|R
30|$|The largest cross-national {{variation}} in {{the values of the}} progressivity index is found in the case of contributory and non-contributory non-means-tested benefits. For example, in the case of <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits,</b> progressivity ranges from 0.84 in Netherlands and 0.78 in Denmark to 0.23 In Lithuania and 0.29 in Latvia. This suggests that despite being generally related to previous earnings, the impact of <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> on the income distribution may vary a lot depending on their actual design as well as the features of the wider tax-benefit system they are embedded in. Similarly, non-contributory benefits range in progressivity from 0.63 in Hungary and 0.59 in Sweden to 0.11 in Lithuania and 0.18 in Portugal and Bulgaria. Given that by design they are not related to market incomes, we would expect this category of tax-benefits instruments to be generally progressive. However, non-contributory benefits are usually categorical benefits. Depending on the ranking in the income distribution of the groups they target, non-contributory benefits may have a larger or smaller effect on inequality.|$|R
30|$|Finally, non-pension and non-means-tested {{benefits}} {{appear to}} play a less important role for the bottom quintile. Particularly <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> are unlikely to contribute much to incomes in the lowest quintile with a few notable exceptions-Denmark, Netherlands, and Belgium. There is more diversity in the relative size of non means-tested non-contributory benefits. They are clearly very important to households in the bottom quintile in Hungary but also in a few other countries such as Luxembourg, Slovakia, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, Romania, Denmark, or Austria.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{developments}} of the system have meant that National Insurance provides {{a significant part of}} the government's revenue (21.5% of the total collected by HMRC.) National Insurance has also become more redistributive over time as its structure has changed to remove the fixed upper contribution limits, albeit with a much lower rate payable by employees on income above a certain level. It has been discussed that the link between an individual's contribution record and the remaining <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> will be weakened further.|$|R

In this article, we specifically examine how Canada’s Compassionate Care Benefit (CCB) - a <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> social program aimed at informal P/EOL caregivers - operates {{as a public health}} response in sustaining informal caregivers providing P/EOL care, and whether or not it adequately addresses known aspects of caregiver burden that are addressed within the population health promotion (PHP) model...|$|R
30|$|Actually, we {{distinguish}} between three {{different types of}} income: labour income, non-labour income, and transfers from the government. Labour income includes gross wages from a main and second job, income from self-employment, income from company shares, and income from agreement contracts (temporary employment contracts). Information on fringe benefits, severance and termination payments, and a company car is also available. Non-labour income covers income from the rental of property or land, interest, dividends, and profit from capital investments. Transfers involve pensions (old age and disability), means-tested benefits (such as the material needs <b>benefit),</b> <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> (unemployment and maternity), and family-related benefits.|$|R

30|$|The Slovak {{benefits}} system comprises three components, {{and every}} component consists of several programmes. <b>Contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> cover various pensions (e.g. for senior citizens, the disabled, the bereaved, and orphans), the sickness benefit, maternity benefit, and unemployment insurance benefit. The {{social assistance programme}} includes the material needs benefit, which is a means-tested transfer provided to families {{to provide them with}} a basic living standard if their income is below the minimum subsistence level. The third component is the state social support programme, which includes several family-related benefits (e.g. a child-birth grant, child benefit, and parental allowance). Eligibility for these transfers does not depend on the contribution history and is not means-tested.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} avoid the {{potentially}} confounding role of changes in worker characteristics, in Sect.  4 we estimate state-of-the-art duration models. To account for selection, we estimate similar models for the outflow from both employment and unemployment, and we allow for worker unobserved heterogeneity. To take into account the dual nature of the Spanish labor market, we model flows to and from temporary and open-ended, or permanent, jobs. And, lastly, to properly capture the impact of the unemployment benefit system, we use workers’ full employment history to measure their entitlement to <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits.</b> Most of these refinements are absent from the recent literature on long-term unemployment, as described in Sect.  2.|$|R
30|$|Reservation {{wages are}} higher for male {{workers who are}} older, more educated, and married or cohabiting. They are also larger the higher are the household’s size and income. Real assets are not significant, {{which may be the}} net outcome of a {{positive}} wealth effect and a negative lock-in effect stemming from homeownership. Financial assets, which are more liquid, do exert a positive impact on reservation wages, and debt attracts a positive sign, so that it is not net wealth that matters. Receipt of <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> is significant for the full sample but not for males, and assistance benefits are not significant for any sample.|$|R
30|$|Not surprisingly, among benefits, {{pensions}} are {{the largest}} component. They are particularly important in Romania, Hungary and Italy. They are least important in the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands where private and/or occupational pension schemes (here included in original income) feature prominently. With {{the exception of a}} few countries -Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, Belgium and Slovenia - <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> (other than pensions) are a relatively small income component totalling less than 5 % of equivalised disposable income. Similarly, non <b>contributory</b> non means-tested <b>benefits</b> account for between 0 and 7 percent of disposable income. They are most important in Hungary, Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg. In most countries, means-tested benefits amount to less than 5 % of disposable income. There are some exceptions such as the UK and Ireland where the prevalence of means-testing has been well documented. Other countries where means-tested benefits also play a more prominent role are France, the Netherlands, Malta and Finland.|$|R
50|$|<b>Contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> are {{payable to}} those {{unemployed}} persons {{with a minimum}} of 12 months contributions over a period of 6 years preceding unemployment. The benefit is payable for 1/3 of the contribution period. The benefit amount is 70% of the legal reference salary plus additional amounts for persons with dependants. The benefit reduces to 60% of the reference salary after 6 months. The minimum benefit is 497 euros per month and the maximum is 1087,20 euros per month for a single person. The non-contributory allowance is available to those persons who are no longer entitled to the contributory pension and who do not have income above 75% of the national minimum wage.|$|R
5000|$|The National Insurance Funds {{are used}} to pay for certain types of welfare {{expenditure}} and National Insurance payments cannot be used directly to fund general government spending. However, any surplus in the funds is invested in government securities, and so is effectively lent to the government at low rates of interest. National Insurance contributions are paid into the various National Insurance Funds after deduction of monies specifically allocated to the National Health Services (NHS). However a small percentage is transferred from the funds to the NHS from certain of the smaller sub-classes. Thus the four NHS organisations are partially funded from NI contributions but not from the NI Fund. [...] Less than half of benefit expenditure (42.1%) now goes on <b>contributory</b> <b>benefits,</b> compared with over 65% in 1978-79 because of the growth of means-tested benefits since the late 1970s.|$|R
