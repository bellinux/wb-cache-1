40|$|Although {{the fact}} that {{high-frequency}} sound waves (9, 000 to 800, 000 cycles per second) disrupt living cells is now well established (Bergmann, 1938), few quantitative data are available, and the data now existing are difficult to compare because of variations {{in the way the}} experiments were conducted. Two types of high-frequency sound generators have been used: the magneto-striction oscillator, which produces vibrations at about 9, 000 cycles per second, and the quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>generator,</b> in which the frequency of the sound depends upon the crystal and can be as high as 800, 000 cycles per second. There are insufficient data at the present time to permit the selection of one sonic fre-quency as superior to all others. As a matter of fact, Stumpf, Green, and Smith (1946) have stated that the degree of disintegration of bacteria by ultrasonic waves is related to the amplitude of intensity of the wave rather than to the frequency, but they do not give any experimental data to support this statement. The present report deals with experiments using a quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>generator</b> of ultrasonic waves...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} the {{realization}} of on-demand reconfigurable arbitrary arrays of microscopic optical vortex generators in chiral liquid <b>crystals.</b> These <b>generators</b> are optically inscribed in frustrated cholesteric films {{by means of the}} laser-induced local winding of the chiral liquid crystal mesophase. This leads to the storage of microscopic, metastable, topological defect structures endowed with space-variant birefringent properties. Such structures are shown to produce optical vortices with a well-defined orbital state {{as a result of a}} spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion process...|$|R
40|$|A {{femtosecond}} laser at 800 nm {{was used to}} create micro-fluidic circuits on lithium niobate (LiNbO 3) substrates by means of laser ablation, using different scanning velocities (100 - 500 μm/s) and laser pulse energies (1 - 20 μJ). The T-junction geometry was exploited to create on y-cut LiNbO 3 <b>crystals</b> a droplet <b>generator,</b> whose microfluidic performance was characterized {{in a wide range}} of droplet generation frequencies, from few Hz to about 1 kHz...|$|R
5000|$|The second design {{consists}} of a wireless system of lighting that will use tiny generators with components designed to resonate at the same frequency of surrounding vibrations. The resonance will then either move a tiny magnet relative to a coil of wire looped around it or apply pressure to a <b>crystal</b> inside the <b>generator</b> to create current. Light-emitting diodes or LEDs connected to such vibration harvesters {{could be used to}} illuminate areas where constant heavy vibration is present, such as train or metro stations, airports or highways. [...] This system will enable lighting without any cables or wires connected to the power grid.|$|R
40|$|A high {{brightness}} electron beam injector system {{is being developed}} for light source R&D at NSRRC. Recently, a test stand for testing the photo-cathode rf gun system is being constructed. The photo-cathode rf gun cavity has been modified from the BNL 1. 6 -cell structure for 2998 MHz operation. A 798 nm Ti:Saphire laser seeded 3 mJ amplifier is employed to produce 300 microjoules UV pulses at 266 nm wavelength from a third harmonic <b>generator</b> <b>crystal</b> for emission of photo-electrons from the Cu-cathode in the rf gun. First operation of this system with Gaussian laser pulses is scheduled in this summer. Electron beam dynamics in the photo-cathode rf gun test stand has been studied with PARMELA. The {{results showed that the}} normalized emittance can be as low as 0. 75 mm-mrad for a 10 psec flattop beam with emittance compensation solenoid...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} carried out {{preliminary}} investigations into coherent imaging using Optical Parametric Oscillators (OPO) for wavelength conversion of near IR images to visible spectrum. A nonlinear <b>crystal,</b> second harmonic <b>generator</b> (SHG), {{was used for}} degenerate optical parametric up-conversion. A Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (KTP) doubling crystal was used to convert incident 1, 540 nm flux to 772 nm. Experiments included investigation of spatial resolution and responsivity of the OPO. Spatial resolution of 1. 3 1 p/mm was attained in both horizontal and vertical axis. Measured responsivity for this OPO configuration compared well with that attained from image intensifier-based systems. Equipment used for this experiment included an ORION SB 2 - 2 R pulsed solid state laser used as a light source and a CCD camera and frame grabber to capture and record all data. The experiment and results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} electro-optical constructions {{in which}} the Casimir force is modulated in opposition to piezo-crystal elasticity, as in a stack of alternating tunably conductive and piezo layers. Adjacent tunably conducting layers tuned to conduct, attract by the Casimir force compressing the intermediate piezo, but when subsequently detuned to insulate, sandwiched piezo layers expand elastically to restore their original dimension. In each cycle some electrical energy is made available from the quantum zero point (zp). We estimate that the maximum power that could be derived at semiconductor THz modulation rates is megawatts/cm 3. Similarly a permittivity wave generated by a THz acoustic wave in a single crystal by the acousto-optic effect produces multiple coherent Casimir wave mode overtones and a bulk mode. We model the Casimir effect in a sinusoidally graded medium finding it to be very enhanced over what is found in a multilayer stack for the equivalent permittivity contrast, and more slowly decreasing with scale, going as the wavelength 1 /λ 2. Acoustic waves give comparable theoretical power levels of MW/cm 3 below normal crystal damage thresholds. Piezo thermodynamic relations give conditions for effective coupling of the Casimir bulk mode to an external electrical load. Casimir wave modes may exchange energy with the main acoustic wave too, which may partially account for THz attenuation seen in materials. We outline feasibility issues for building a practical <b>crystal</b> power <b>generator.</b> Comment: 36 pages, 14 figure...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} and `proof of principle' experiments showed {{clearly the}} interest of using <b>crystals</b> as photon <b>generators</b> dedicated to intense positron sources for linear colliders. An experimental investigation, using a 10 GeV secondary electron beam, of the SPS-CERN, impinging on an axially oriented thick tungsten crystal, has been prepared and operated between May and August 2000. After a short recall on the main features of positron sources using channeling in oriented crystals, the experimental set-up is described. A particular emphasis is put on the positron detector made of a drift chamber, partially immersed in a magnetic field. The enhancement in photon and positron production in the aligned crystal have been observed in the energy range 5 to 40 GeV, for the incident electrons, in crystals of 4 and 8 mm as in an hybrid target. The first results concerning this experiment are presented hereafter. Comment: 3 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Linac 200...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} {{multiple}} scattering of high energy protons in a silicon crystal at its amorphous orientation was studied by simulation of proton trajectories {{in the model}} of binary collisions and by a straight simulation of the sequences of proton collisions with atoms when their impact parameters are randomly and uniformly distributed on the symmetry cell for a given crystallography direction. The value of the RMS deflection of multiple scattering obtained by the simulation is in a good agreement with the experiment and more than 15 % larger than it follows from the Moliere theory. The obtained RMS deflection used in the Gaussian approach of multiple scattering well describes dechanneling of protons {{in the frame of}} the planar potential model. Different number of proton collisions with atoms occurs along the same crystal length for different crystal orientations. However, the change of the collision number is compensated by the corresponding change of the mean square deflection in a single collision. Therefore, multiple scattering is the same for different <b>crystal</b> orientations. The <b>generator</b> of multiple scattering for amorphous crystal orientations was proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the IRAD flexible-probe sonic extensometer consisted of: a performance analysis of the MB- 7 D readout electronic circuit; an accuracy check of the system for both distances and small displacements; measurements of sensitivity to strong shocks; and measurements of sensitivity to temperature changes. The electronic-circuit analysis indicated an accuracy of +- 0. 001 in. (0. 025 mm) that is limited primarily by the counter circuit. Other components of the readout circuit (e. g., <b>crystal</b> oscillator, pulse <b>generator,</b> and amplifiers) gave consistently stable and reliable responses. Sensitivity of the sonic-probe system to strong shock waves in granite was investigated {{with a series of}} high-explosive tests in the Climax tunnel complex at the Nevada Test Site. Five magnetic anchors were located in a borehole, and three 50, 000 g accelerometers were installed in separate boreholes nearby. Peak radial accelerations of from 2100 g up to about 32, 000 g were measured after the detonation of individual line charges at varying distances. Sonic-probe readings of the distance between magnetic anchors, taken before and after each line-charge detonation, had differences that generally fell within the inherent accuracy (+- 0. 002 in. [0. 051 mm]) for the sonic extensometer that was used. A temperature bath, which incorporated the test bed used in the displacement-accuracy tests, was designed and built to check the sensitivity of the sonic probe to temperature variations. Sonic-probe readings exhibited a definite sensitivity to temperature changes over the range of 20 to 50 {sup 0 }C for the four segments of the probe that were monitored. Recommendations are made for increasing the accuracy and performance of the IRAD sonic extensometer and other studies are suggested to supplement the present report. 17 refs., 24 figs., 4 tabs...|$|R
