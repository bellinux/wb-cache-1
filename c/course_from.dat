Seeking warmer weather, he and Jane spent the next three years traveling, beginning with a stay in Madeira and followed by tours of Europe and the Bahamas. In Rome, he visited Nathaniel Hawthorne; the two men spent much time together and the author found the retired president as buoyant as ever.|$|E

5|$|North of CR22, Rutgers Creek {{merges with}} Indigot Creek, a small stream forming {{part of the}} Minisink–Wawayanda town line. The {{combined}} stream continues {{to serve as the}} boundary between the two towns as Rutgers Creek takes on a southeasterly <b>course</b> <b>from</b> this point. NY284 crosses over the waterway, entering Wawayanda and connecting to CR93 (Lime Kiln Road) just north of the town line. From CR93, the highway runs northeastward across open, rolling terrain, following an active part of the MNJ Railroad to the hamlet of Slate Hill.

5|$|Rowing {{has existed}} {{along the river}} in Manchester and Salford since 1823. A regatta was inaugurated on 12 September 1842 on a {{straight}} <b>course</b> <b>from</b> Throstle's Nest Weir to Regent Road Bridge. Racing continued in Manchester with events such as Agecroft Regatta and Warburton Regatta. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, rowing was very popular in the area with many local clubs such as Nemesis, Prince of Wales, Minerva, Didsbury and Agecroft all competing regularly. With the decline in the condition of the water, by the Second World War only Agecroft and Broughton rowing clubs were still active.|$|E
5|$|The State Trunkline Highway System {{was created}} on May 13, 1913, by {{an act of}} the Michigan Legislature; at the time, one of the system's {{divisions}} corresponded to the initial segment of M-140. Division5 followed a <b>course</b> <b>from</b> Niles northward to Mackinaw City that encompassed the highway between Watervliet and South Haven. In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) signposted the highway system for the first time, and the future M-140 corridor was assigned to part of the original M-11. On November 11, 1926, M-11 was redesignated as part of US31 in the state.|$|E

5|$|While on {{the move}} the lead {{vehicles}} of the patrol commanders and sergeants flew a small flag. Because the LRP was organised on divisional cavalry lines the leaders carried green flags for 'A' (HQ) Troop, black for 'B' Troop, yellow for 'C' Troop and red for 'D'. When the LRDG was organised into 11 vehicle patrols this was simplified to a green flag displaying the patrol letter in white; the later half-patrols used a plain green flag on occasion. When it became necessary to change <b>course</b> <b>from</b> an intended route, or {{in the event of}} enemy action, patrol movements were controlled by a simple semaphore flag system using blue and white signal flags, or hand signals, depending on how widely dispersed the trucks were.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, MT 287 was rerouted again. The highway {{replaced}} MT 34 from Ennis to Twin Bridges, ran concurrently with MT 41 {{to north}} of Silver Star, and replaced S-401 north to US 10 at Whitehall. MT 287 continued east with US 10 to rejoin its previous route west of Three Forks. The {{portion of the}} highway between Ennis and the US 10 junction became MT 287A. The next major change came in 1965, when US 287 was placed on its present <b>course</b> <b>from</b> West Yellowstone to Choteau. The Raynolds Pass road became MT 50 (now MT 87), and MT 287 was removed from its 1961 course south of Ennis and north of Whitehall. The highway's final extension was north from US 10 to I-90 in Whitehall in 1966 when the Interstate Highway was completed through the area. MT 287 attained its current length when it was truncated at Twin Bridges in 1977. The portion of the highway from Silver Star to Whitehall became MT 55. MT 287 was resurfaced from Twin Bridges to Sheridan in 2000, near Ennis in 2007, from west of Ennis through Virginia City to Alder in 2008, and from Alder to Sheridan in 2009.|$|E
5|$|One of the British {{reinforcements}} cruising in the Central Mediterranean in June was the frigate , {{commanded by}} Captain Edward Foote. Seahorse was officially rated as a 38-gun ship, {{but in reality}} carried 46 guns, including 14 32-pounder carronades, very heavy short-range cannon. Foote had been despatched by Earl St. Vincent to join Nelson's squadron in his hunt for the French and carried on board a number of reinforcements for , one of Nelson's ships commanded by Captain Thomas Troubridge. On 26 June 1798, Seahorse was passing along the southern Sicilian coast in search {{of information about the}} whereabouts of the British fleet when at 16:00 his lookout sighted a ship. Advancing rapidly, Foote recognised the stranger as a French frigate and prepared for battle. The frigate was Sensible, which was on a northeasterly <b>course</b> <b>from</b> Malta to Toulon when sighted. Bourdé, knowing that his ship was overladen, undermanned and carried only 36 guns, some of which were only 6-pounders, turned away and sailed south, hoping to outrun his opponent during the night.|$|E
50|$|Qualified students, {{who were}} {{sponsored}} by their employers, were admitted to NTU and then could register for <b>courses</b> <b>from</b> {{any of the}} participating universities. Thus they could work with a faculty adviser to build a program best fitting their individual needs by enrolling in <b>courses</b> <b>from</b> multiple universities. Each degree program was created, maintained and updated by a faculty committee {{from a range of}} member universities. Although each course was being taught on its home campus, it was selected by the faculty committee to be integrated into the NTU program with appropriate <b>courses</b> <b>from</b> other member schools. This approach offered NTU students a multi-university array of <b>courses</b> <b>from</b> which to select. When their Master’s program was completed, they received their degree from National Technological University (NTU), even though their courses may have come from a half dozen different schools.|$|R

5|$|US 301 was {{expanded}} to a divided highway {{from the southern}} end of the Glen Burnie Bypass to Benfield in 1956 and 1957. The highway's second set of lanes, including a new bridge across Severn Run, was constructed and the existing roadway was reconstructed from Benfield to Millersville between 1957 and 1960. The second set of lanes was built on the west side of what became a very wide median, which allowed businesses to site themselves in the median between the northbound and southbound lanes. During construction of the Benfield–Millersville stretch, US 301 was relocated to its present <b>course</b> <b>from</b> Bowie to the Eastern Shore and replaced with MD 3. A pair of ramps between the Glen Burnie Bypass and MD 177's freeway southern bypass of Glen Burnie (now MD 100) were constructed between 1963 and 1965. The first section of highway south of Dorrs Corner was built between 1969 and 1972 as a two-lane segment of MD 32 from east of Odenton to MD 178 in Crownsville. The highway used what are now the ramps of I-97's partial interchange with MD 178 and had a five-ramp interchange with MD 3 in Millersville that lacked access from northbound MD 3 to eastbound MD 32 and from westbound MD 32 to southbound MD 3.|$|E
5|$|With {{the modern}} {{game of golf}} {{originating}} in 15th century Scotland, the country is promoted {{as the home of}} golf. To many golfers the Old Course in the Fife town of St. Andrews, an ancient links course dating to before 1574, is considered a site of pilgrimage. In 1764, the standard 18-hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the <b>course</b> <b>from</b> 22 to 18 holes. The world's oldest golf tournament, and golf's first major, is The Open Championship, which was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club, in Ayrshire, Scotland, with Scottish golfers winning the earliest majors. There are many other famous golf courses in Scotland, including Carnoustie, Gleneagles, Muirfield, and Royal Troon. Other distinctive features of the national sporting culture include the Highland games, curling and shinty. In boxing, Scotland has had 13 world champions, including Ken Buchanan, Benny Lynch and Jim Watt.|$|E
