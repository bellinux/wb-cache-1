This paper presents a numerical model for simulating the <b>cold</b> <b>filling</b> of a receiver tube. The model uses the volume of fractionmethod to track the interface betweenthe molten salt and {{the air and the}} enthalpy method to describe the liquid-solid phase change of the molten salt. This model was used to simulate the <b>cold</b> <b>filling</b> tests of the Molten Salt Electric Experiment (MSEE) receiver. This model was then use to simulate the dynamic process of <b>cold</b> <b>filling</b> a vertical receiver tube. Three modes of <b>cold</b> <b>filling,</b> including successful filling, partial frozen filling and fully frozen filling, were demonstrated. The results show that high initial temperature of the receiver tubes is benefit for successful filling...|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} reduce nightly {{parasitic}} power consumption in a molten salt central receiver is discussed where salt is drained from the piping and heat tracing {{is turned off}} to allow the piping to cool to ambient overnight, then {{in the morning the}} pipes are filled while they are cold. Since the piping and areas of the receiver in a molten-nitrate salt central-receiver solar power plant must be electrically heated to maintain their temperatures above the nitrate salt freezing point (430 {degrees}F, 221 {degrees}C), considerable energy could be used to maintain such temperatures during nightly shut down and bad weather. Experiments and analyses have been conducted to investigate <b>cold</b> <b>filling</b> receiver panels and piping as a way of reducing parasitic electrical power consumption and increasing the availability of the plant. The two major concerns with <b>cold</b> <b>filling</b> are: (1) how far can the molten salt penetrate cold piping before freezing closed and (2) what thermal stresses develop during the associated thermal shock.

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} with a molten salt loop at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM to resolve issues associated with {{the operation of the}} 10 MW{sub e} Solar Two Central Receiver Power Plant located near Barstow, CA. The salt loop contained two receiver panels, components such as flanges and a check valve, vortex shedding and ultrasonic flow meters, and an impedance pressure transducer. Tests were conducted on procedures for filling and thawing a panel, and assessing components and instrumentation in a molten salt environment. Four categories of experiments were conducted: (1) <b>cold</b> <b>filling</b> procedures, (2) freeze/thaw procedures, (3) component tests, and (4) instrumentation tests. Cold-panel and -piping fill experiments are described, in which the panels and piping were preheated to temperatures below the salt freezing point prior to initiating flow, to determine the feasibility of <b>cold</b> <b>filling</b> the receiver and piping. The transient thermal response was measured, and heat transfer coefficients and transient stresses were calculated from the data. Freeze/thaw experiments were conducted with the panels, in which the salt was intentionally allowed to freeze in the receiver tubes, then thawed with heliostat beams. Slow thermal cycling tests were conducted to measure both how well various designs of flanges (e. g., tapered flanges or clamp type flanges) hold a seal under thermal conditions typical of nightly shut down, and the practicality of using these flanges on high maintenance components. In addition, the flanges were thermally shocked to simulate cold starting the system. Instrumentation such as vortex shedding and ultrasonic flow meters were tested alongside each other, and compared with flow measurements from calibration tanks in the flow loop...|$|E

Results showed that the peak force of <b>cold</b> <b>filled</b> cream cheese was only ~ 25 % of the hot filled cream cheese, as was the area to peak. The hot filled cream cheese exhibited higher Young’s Modulus compared to the <b>cold</b> <b>filled</b> cream cheese as well whereas the latter had a higher initial shear stress and apparent viscosity.

40|$|This paper reports {{investigations}} {{of the influence of}} porosity and casting defects on the static and constant-amplitude fatigue strength of a die-cast aluminium alloy. Three batches of specimens, differing in the sprue-runner design and consequently in content and types of defects, were tested in 'as-cast' conditions. Defects consisted of gas and shrinkage pores as well as <b>cold</b> <b>fills,</b> dross and alumina skins. Casting defects were observed to reduce significantly the static and fatigue properties of the material. Whereas for the static characteristics the decrease was progressive with the porosity range, for the fatigue strength the decrease was most significant from the lowest to the middle porosity range. The batches were classified with regard to the porosity level, as the metallurgical defects were not detectable through X-ray examination. The content and size of metallurgical defects were observed to increase together with the porosity level. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of the fracture surfaces demonstrated the important role played by dross, alumina skins and, above all, <b>cold</b> <b>fills</b> on the fatigue fracture...|$|R

40|$|High-pressure {{die-casting}} {{is widely}} used in the automotive field {{for the possibility of}} obtaining net to shape components of complex geometry and thin wall thickness at high production rates. A number of process parameters exists, which, if not adequately determined and adjusted, result in a decadence of quality of the die cast part. Common defects in die castings are shrinkage cavities, <b>cold</b> <b>fills,</b> oxide skins, dross, entrapped air bubbles. It’s common opinion that defects can make the mechanical behaviour of castings unpredictable. The influence of casting defects on the mechanical properties of die cast aluminium alloys is described below. Castings with thin sections, like those produced by high-pressure die-casting, are vulnerable to the effect of defects since a single macro-defect can cover a significant fraction of the cross-section area. As a consequence, {{it is important to understand}} and predict the effect of defects on mechanical properties of die cast components to obtain substantial technological improvements...|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises {{the results}} of a CRAFT project {{investigating}} the influence of casting defects on material properties for a high pressure die cast aluminium alloy.

For the specimens, the influence is straightforward, while for components no significant difference was found between batches of components, judged as "acceptable" and "non acceptable" by the quality inspection within the foundry. Fatigue testing showed four different fracture regions; two corresponding to a region of high stress as indicated by a FEM simulation. For the other two regions of failure, voids or oxide layers of significant dimensions were observed on the fracture regions. These regions corresponded to regions of last solidification; moreover, for these regions, simulation of the casting process pointed out the presence of tensile residual stresses inside the cast component...|$|R

40|$|Washing {{machine and}} {{dishwasher}} appliance use accounts for approximately 10 % of electricity demand in EU households. The majority of this demand {{is due to}} the operation of electric heating elements inside appliances. This paper investigates the potential benefits that can be realised by adding a hot fill connection to washing appliances, with respect to carbon emissions, demand side management and renewable energy integration. Initial laboratory testing of new hot and <b>cold</b> <b>fill</b> appliances has resulted in modifications to optimise hot fill intake, and a novel numerical model presents a method of characterising appliance electricity use in different configurations. In order to validate model findings and test the use of new hot fill appliances in situ, a pilot study has recorded appliances’ resource consumption at one-minute resolution in fourteen households. The addition of hot fill reduced the total dishwasher and washing machine electricity consumption by 38 % and 67 % respectively. Depending on how hot water is supplied to appliances it is estimated that hot fill use results in an annual household carbon saving of up to 147 kgCO 2. Further to direct electricity reduction, hot fill appliances can offer a method of time shifting demand away from peak periods without inconveniencing occupants’ lifestyles...|$|R

As the polar circles are in 23° 28", a line drawn through the south pole, for instance, commencing on one side of the earth at the antarctic circle, and extending to the other, would traverse a distance materially exceeding that between New York and Lisbon.

40|$|Abstract—Large {{starting}} voltages {{in metal}} halide lamps result in sputtering of the electrodes and reduced lamp life. A two-di-mensional plasma hydrodynamics model was used to investigate breakdown in metal halide lamp. Images depicting {{the progress of the}} breakdown in Ar during cold startup are presented. Index Terms—Avalanche, breakdown, HID, lamp, modeling, plasma. METAL halide arc lamps are widely used sources of in-door and large area outdoor illumination due to their fa-vorable color characteristics and high efficiency [1]. The <b>cold</b> <b>fill</b> of such lamps contains 10 s of torr of a rare gas, typically Ar, with the vapor pressure of condensed metal and metal-halide salts. The electrical breakdown during startup produces warming of the discharge tube and vaporization of the metal (-halide) salts, resulting in a multiatmosphere plasma at steady state. The high voltages needed to breakdown the gas may sputter electrode ma-terial and decrease the life of the lamp. In order to facilitate breakdown of the cold gas, techniques such as auxiliary elec-trodes and ultraviolet (UV) radiation sources are often employed to create seed electrons in the discharge tube [2]. A two-dimensional plasma hydrodynamics model [3] was implemented on a geometry closely resembling a commercial polycrystalline alumina metal halide lamp to simulate break-down processes during cold startup. The variables solved are the electric potential from Poisson’s equation and species den-sities from multifluid transport equations. Gain and loss terms include sources from electron impact ionization and excitation; and electron secondary emission and photoionization due to ex-ternal UV sources and internally generated photons. Sources due to secondary electrons emitted from the cathode are ac-counted for using a Monte Carlo simulation. The species in...|$|R
