The Everton match versus Luton Town in May 1991 was the final time that Gwladys Street allowed standing spectators.

5|$|Mugabe's {{government}} {{continued to}} make regular pronouncements about converting Zimbabwe into a socialist society, although did not take <b>concrete</b> <b>steps</b> in that direction. In contrast to Mugabe's talk of socialism, his government's budgetary policies were conservative, operating within a capitalist framework and emphasising the need for foreign investment. In office, Mugabe sought a gradual transformation away from capitalism and tried to build upon existing state institutions. From 1980 to 1990, the country's economy grew {{by an average of}} 2.7% a year, but this was outstripped by population growth and real income declined. The unemployment rate rose, reaching 26% in 1990. The government ran a budget deficit year-on-year that averaged at 10% of the country's gross domestic product. Under Mugabe's leadership, there was a massive expansion in education and health spending. In 1980, Zimbabwe had 177 secondary schools, but by 2000 this number had risen to 1,548. During that period, the adult literacy rate rose from 62% to 82%, one of the best records in Africa. Levels of child immunisation were raised from 25% of the population to 92%.|$|E

25|$|Leaders need {{to ensure}} that {{conflict}} remains constructive. That is, they must stimulate task-oriented disagreement and debate while trying to minimize interpersonal conflict.

25|$|The {{widespread}} support of action against communists and their associates began to abate somewhat after Senator Joseph McCarthy overreached {{himself in the}} Army-McCarthy Hearings, producing a backlash. The end of the Korean War in 1953 also led to a lessening of anxieties about subversion. The Supreme Court brought {{a halt to the}} Smith Act prosecutions in 1957 in its decision in Yates v.

Ingo Rechenberg and his group were able to solve complex engineering problems through evolution strategies as documented in his 1971 PhD thesis and the resulting 1973 book. John Holland was highly influential during the 1970s.

There is a rear promenade at this level, but several tiers of later timber seating have been installed here, restricting pedestrian circulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{historic}} Georgia Arch {{which sits}} on the edge of North campus was installed in 1864. It serves as the official icon and a historic landmark for the University. Since the 1900s, tradition has held that students may not pass beneath the Arch until they have received a diploma from the University of Georgia. Those who walked under the Arch prior to graduation commencement were to said to never graduate. The tradition began when Daniel Huntley Redfearn, Class of 1910, arrived as a freshman from Boston, Georgia and vowed not to pass beneath the Arch until he had graduated. One of Redfearn's professors heard the vow and repeated it to his class, and the tradition has stood ever since. Many freshmen, learning of the tradition during orientation or from other sources still choose to honor the century-old tradition. Years of following the tradition are visible on the <b>concrete</b> <b>steps</b> leading to the Arch. Steps to each side have been worn down over the years as undergraduates have kept their vows.|$|E
25|$|The weir by Station Lane, Oughtibridge {{served the}} Upper Middlewood forge, {{described}} as a tilt in the sources, as it had a tilt hammer which was raised up and allowed to drop to shape the metal. The weir is in good order, {{although much of the}} original structure has been replaced by <b>concrete</b> <b>steps.</b> Next came Middlewood Works, which was a rolling mill and slitting mill, splitting bars of iron into thin strips for the manufacture of nails. Four water wheels were recorded in the 1820s, and water power was still being uses in 1900. The site was cleared after 1985, but the stone weir, with its nine bays, remains. Beeley Wood or Nova Scotia Tilts was a sizeable operation, with eight water wheels operating in the 1830s, four wheels driving two forges, another two driving the bellows for the forges, and the final two driving two tilt hammers. The works was recorded as derelict by 1895. In February 2016 the Environment Agency removed the middle two-thirds of Beeley Wood Lower Weir as part of a scheme to allow the free migration of fish and let the river return to a more natural form. The next works was Hawksley or Clay Wheels which employed 54 men in 1794, and was still using water power in 1895. The site was used to make scythes until after 1941, when a film, which can be seen at the Kelham Island Museum, was made of its activity. The weir has five bays, but is deteriorating.|$|E
