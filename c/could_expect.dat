5|$|Due to the lord's {{presence}} in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as {{without the support of}} his more powerful tenants a lord <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately below them on the social scale, but absentees <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> to find their influence weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, and it would be impractical for a lord to visit all his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.|$|E

With McKinley's close friend Hanna instead in the Senate, Foraker was allowed to recommend appointees to the President, but McKinley allowed Hanna to exercise a veto over Foraker's candidates.|$|E

5|$|Britain's {{enemies in}} {{continental}} Europe had long recognised Ireland as a weak point in Britain's defences. Landing troops {{there was a}} popular strategic goal, not only because an invader <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> {{the support of a}} large proportion of the native population, but also because at least initially they would face fewer and less reliable troops than elsewhere in the British Isles. Additionally, embroiling the British Army in a protracted Irish campaign would reduce its availability for other theatres of war. Finally, French planners considered that a successful invasion of Ireland might act as the ideal platform for a subsequent invasion of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, {{the railway}} network came to Milford, linking {{it to the}} Haverfordwest line and beyond. In 1866, work was {{completed}} on an additional extension which provided access to the docks and ship-breaking yard {{on the eastern side}} of the town. Between 1875 and 1886 The Great Eastern was a permanent fixture at Milford Docks, remaining there for lengthy repairs. Her arrival into the docks was heralded as an example of the scale of vessel which the town <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> to attract.|$|E
5|$|Richard and Edward {{were forced}} to flee to Burgundy in October 1470 after Warwick {{defected}} {{to the side of}} the former Lancastrian queen Margaret of Anjou, and for a second time Richard was forced to seek refuge in the Low Countries, which were part of the realm of the Duchy of Burgundy. In 1468, Richard's sister Margaret had married Charles the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy, and the brothers <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> a welcome there. Although only eighteen years old, Richard played crucial roles in the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury that resulted in Edward's restoration to the throne in spring 1471.|$|E

5|$|Social {{rigidification}} {{became a}} common feature of Soviet society. During the Stalin {{era in the}} 1930s and 1940s, a common labourer <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> promotion to a white-collar job if he studied and obeyed Soviet authorities. In Brezhnev's Soviet Union {{this was not the}} case. Holders of attractive positions clung to them as long as possible; mere incompetence was not seen as a good reason to dismiss anyone. In this way, too, the Soviet society Brezhnev passed on had become static.|$|E
5|$|The German Geheime Staatspolizei ("Secret state police"), {{known as}} the Gestapo, was {{responsible}} for targeting resistance groups in Belgium. Resistance fighters who were captured <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> to be interrogated, tortured and either summarily executed or sent to a concentration camp. The Gestapo was effective at using informants within groups to betray whole local resistance network and in examining resistance publications for clues about its place of production. 2,000 resistance members involved in underground press alone were arrested during the war. In total, 30,000 members of the resistance were captured during the war, of whom 16,000 were executed or died in captivity.|$|E
5|$|As king, Matthias waged wars {{against the}} Czech mercenaries who {{dominated}} Upper Hungary (today parts of Slovakia and Northern Hungary) and against Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, who claimed Hungary for himself. In this period, the Ottoman Empire conquered Serbia and Bosnia, terminating {{the zone of}} buffer states along the southern frontiers of the Kingdom of Hungary. Matthias signed a peace treaty with Frederick III in 1463, acknowledging the Emperor's right to style himself King of Hungary. The Emperor returned the Holy Crown of Hungary with which Matthias was crowned on 29 April 1464. In this year, Matthias invaded the territories that had recently been occupied by the Ottomans and seized fortresses in Bosnia. He soon realized he <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> no substantial aid from the Christian powers and gave up his anti-Ottoman policy.|$|E

5|$|Frustrated by the {{mobility}} of the Ottoman batteries, which evaded the Allied bombardments and threatened the minesweepers sent to clear the Straits, Churchill began pressuring the naval commander, Admiral Sackville Carden, to increase the fleet's efforts. Carden drew up fresh plans and on 4 March sent a cable to Churchill, stating that the fleet <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> to arrive in Constantinople within 14 days. A sense of impending victory was heightened by the interception of a German wireless message that revealed the Ottoman Dardanelles forts were running out of ammunition. When the message was relayed to Carden, it was agreed a main attack would be launched on or around 17 March. It transpired that Carden, suffering from stress, {{was placed on the}} sick list by the medical officer and command was taken over by Admiral John de Robeck.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{women in}} America were {{reaching}} out for greater control of their lives. Husbands and fathers directed the lives of women, and many doors were closed to female participation. State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work. In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 {{as an attempt to}} find a way in which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1567, in a swoop {{known as}} the Surprise of Meaux, Huguenot forces {{attempted}} to ambush the king, triggering renewed civil war. Taken unawares, the court fled to Paris in disarray. The war was ended by the Peace of Longjumeau of 22–23 March 1568, but civil unrest and bloodshed continued. The Surprise of Meaux marked {{a turning point in}} Catherine's policy towards the Huguenots. From that moment, she abandoned compromise for a policy of repression. She told the Venetian ambassador in June 1568 that all one <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> from Huguenots was deceit, and she praised the Duke of Alba's reign of terror in the Netherlands, where Calvinists and rebels were put to death in the thousands.|$|E

5|$|On the French right flank, General Ferino {{attempted}} {{to push the}} Austrians back, first with a cannonade, followed by an attack through the woods {{on both sides of}} the road between the hamlet of Asch and Stockach. A third charge succeeded in taking the road, but the Austrian forces reformed the line and the artillery, now at the head of a wedge, bombarded the French troops. In a bayonet charge, the French took the hamlet of Wahlweiss, but Ferino's troops could not hold it and withdrew during the night. Jourdan then ordered a general withdrawal from the region, instructing his divisions to retreat along the lines of march they had followed into the region, and himself establishing a command post at Hornberg. He sent the cavalry to the western side of the Black Forest, where the horses <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> to find better forage.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{insurance system}} devised by McGivney gave a deceased Knight's widow a $1,000 death benefit. Each member was assessed $1 upon a death, {{and when the}} number of Knights grew beyond 1,000, the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase. Each member, regardless of age, was assessed equally. As a result, younger, healthier members <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older. There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 weeks (roughly equivalent to $125.75 in 2009 dollars). If he remained sick after that, the council to which he belonged determined the sum of money given to him.|$|E

When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.|$|E

5|$|Although Favorite was wrecked, over 200 of {{her crew}} and soldier-passengers {{had reached the}} land and, having set fire to their ship, {{prepared}} to march on Port St. George {{under the leadership of}} Colonel Gifflenga. Two British midshipmen left in command of the town organised the British and indigenous population into a defensive force and marched to meet Gifflenga. The junior British officers informed Gifflenga that the return of the British squadron would bring overwhelming numbers of sailors, marines and naval artillery to bear on his small force and that if he surrendered immediately he <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> better terms. Gifflenga recognised that his position was untenable and capitulated. At Port St. George, the Venetian gunboat Lodola sneaked unnoticed into the harbour and almost captured a Sicilian privateer, Vincitore. The raider was driven off by the remaining garrison of the town without the prize, while attempting to manoeuvre her out of the bay.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} May 1457, a large Ottoman {{army was}} seen {{approaching}} Albania. Skanderbeg {{sent a letter to}} Calixtus informing him of the Ottoman arrival and the dire need for military aid. The pope responded with a promise to send a fleet to Albania – even though the enemy was on land – but it did not arrive. Skanderbeg was thus left to fight the oncoming Ottoman army alone. Mehmed II had placed Isak Bey Evrenoz and Hamza Kastrioti in command of the force. Isak bey was an experienced commander who had crushed John Kastrioti's rebellion in 1430 and led the Ottoman counterattack at the Siege of Berat. Hamza brought along with him several disaffected Albanian nobles and personal knowledge of the tactics they <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> from Skanderbeg. In total, Ottoman forces numbered between 50,000 and 80,000 men. Armies of this size were usually commanded by the sultan himself so rumors spread that Mehmed was leading the campaign. In contrast, Skanderbeg had between 8,000 and 10,000 men to stand in opposition.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} {{graduation}} in 1968, Kikai worked {{for two years}} as a truck driver and for two in a shipyard. Meanwhile, he stayed {{in touch with his}} philosophy professor from his university days, Sadayoshi Fukuda, whose interests extended to writing a regular column for the magazine Camera Mainichi; he introduced Kikai to its editor, Shōji Yamagishi, who showed him photographs by Diane Arbus that made a great impact on Kikai. Kikai started to take photographs in 1969. At that time (when somebody fresh out of university <b>could</b> <b>expect</b> to earn ¥40,000 per month), a Hasselblad SLR camera normally cost ¥600,000; Kikai heard of an opportunity to buy one for ¥320,000 and mentioned this to Fukuda, who immediately lent him the money, with no interest, and no date or pressure for repayment. (The loan was eventually repaid.) This Hasselblad 500CM, with its 80mm lens, is what Kikai has used for his portraits ever since.|$|E
