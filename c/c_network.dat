50|$|IGRP is {{considered}} a classful routing protocol. Because the protocol has no field for a subnet mask, the router assumes that all subnetwork addresses within the same Class A, Class B, or Class <b>C</b> <b>network</b> have the same subnet mask as the subnet mask configured for the interfaces in question. This contrasts with classless routing protocols that can use variable length subnet masks. Classful protocols have become less popular as they are wasteful of IP address space.|$|E

50|$|The first {{architecture}} change {{extended the}} addressing capability in the Internet, {{but did not}} prevent IP address exhaustion. The problem was that many sites needed larger address blocks than a Class <b>C</b> <b>network</b> provided, and therefore they received a Class B block, which was in most cases much larger than required. In {{the rapid growth of}} the Internet, the pool of unassigned Class B addresses (214, or about 16,000) was rapidly being depleted. Classful networking was replaced by Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), starting in 1993 with the specification of RFC 1518 and RFC 1519, to attempt to solve this problem.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an interior point algorithm based on a. <b>c.</b> <b>network</b> model {{for determining the}} Nash supply function equilibrium (SFE) of bid-based electricity markets. The SFE problem is considered as a bi-level game. At the first level, the problem begins with the formulation of an optimal power flow (OPF) interior point-based algorithm to handle the independent system operator (ISO) problem for maximising social welfare. This algorithm {{is based on the}} OPF with a. <b>c.</b> <b>network</b> transmission model taking into account all the operating aspects such as the generation capacity limits, bus voltage limits, transmission line constraints, network losses and especially the effect of the reactive power. The resulting Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the problem at the first level are then reformulated using nonlinear complementarity constraints and incorporated as equality constraints in the second-level formulation for maximising the individual profit for each strategic generating firm. By employing a special nonlinear complementarity function, the complementarity constraints are then transformed into nonlinear algebraic expressions, thus the KKT conditions of the resulting combined problem can be derived. The final problem is then solved iteratively based on the solution techniques of the interior point algorithm. Numerical examples of a three-bus system, the IEEE 14 -bus system and the IEEE 30 -bus system, show that the algorithm can successfully determine the electricity market equilibrium with the a. <b>c.</b> <b>network</b> model. ...|$|E

40|$|Graphene {{is easily}} {{produced}} by thermally reducing graphene oxide. However, defect {{formation in the}} <b>C</b> <b>network</b> during deoxygenation compromises the charge carrier mobility in the reduced material. Understanding the mechanisms of the thermal reactions is essential for defining alternative routes able to limit the density of defects generated by carbon evolution. Here, we identify a dual path mechanism in the thermal reduction of graphene oxide driven by the oxygen coverage: at low surface density, the O atoms adsorbed as epoxy groups evolve as O 2 leaving the <b>C</b> <b>network</b> unmodified. At higher coverage, the formation of other O-containing species opens competing reaction channels, which consume the C backbone. We combined spectroscopic tools and ab initio calculations to probe the species residing {{on the surface and}} those released in the gas phase during heating and to identify reaction pathways and rate-limiting steps. Our results illuminate the current puzzling scenario of the low temperature gasification of graphene oxide...|$|E
