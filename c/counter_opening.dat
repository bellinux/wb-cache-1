50|$|In the 1930s, many Greek {{restaurants}} in the U.S. went out of business, {{in part due to}} problems that occurred during the Great Depression. During this time, competition increased due to an increase of affordably-priced lunch <b>counters</b> <b>opening</b> in various types of stores, such as drug stores and department stores.

50|$|The {{concept of}} {{prepared}} meals {{to be eaten}} elsewhere dates back to antiquity. Market and roadside stalls selling food were common in both Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. In Pompeii, archaeologists have found a number of thermopolia. These were service <b>counters,</b> <b>opening</b> onto the street, which provided food {{to be taken away}} and eaten elsewhere. There is a distinct lack of formal dining and kitchen area in Pompeian homes, which may suggest that eating, or at least cooking, at home was unusual. Over 200 thermopolia have been found in the ruins of Pompeii.|$|R

50|$|This ensures that, in any terrain, {{the player}} will not {{experience}} {{more than one}} random encounter every eight steps. A game {{with this type of}} system can sometimes be taken advantage of by initiating some action that will reset the <b>counter</b> (pausing, <b>opening</b> a menu, saving), especially when using an emulator.

For example, transposition {{tables are}} used to record positions that have been previously evaluated, to save recalculation of them. Refutation tables record key moves that [...] "refute" [...] what appears to be a good move; these are typically tried first in variant positions (since a move that refutes one position is likely to refute another). Opening books aid computer programs by giving common openings that are considered good play (and good ways to <b>counter</b> poor <b>openings).</b> Many chess engines use pondering to increase their strength.|$|R
50|$|Opening books aid {{computer}} programs by giving common openings {{that are considered}} good ways to <b>counter</b> poor <b>openings.</b> All strong programs use opening books and update their books automatically after each game. To go through all positions from all games in the game database and determine the best move not played in any database game, transposition tables are used to record positions that have been previously searched. This means those positions {{do not need to}} be searched again. This is time-consuming as a deep search must be performed for each position, but once this is done, updating the book is easy. After each game played, all new positions are searched for the best deviation.|$|R

5|$|From 1915 onwards the MTT had {{to compete}} against {{unregulated}} private buses, often preceding the trams on the same route to steal fares, which the MTT <b>countered</b> by <b>opening</b> their own motor bus routes from 1925. The South Australian government began regulating buses within the state in 1927, although some private operators used {{a provision in the}} Australian constitution to their advantage. By notionally marking each ticket as a fare from the pickup point to Murrayville, Victoria (but allowing passengers to board or alight sooner) companies avoided having to abide by the regulation for some time. Up until the end of World War I, most Adelaideans were dependent on public transport for daily journeys. The introduction of private automobiles decreased passenger numbers until petrol rationing during World War II led to a resurgence in patronage; patronage remained higher than before the war, until rationing was discontinued in 1951.|$|R

The plans were condemned by some opposition MSPs. In November 2016, it emerged that 58 further stations could close as part of an estates review.|$|R
5000|$|Expanding {{his empire}} quickly from 1899, he {{acquired}} the Leeds Tivoli theatre, renaming it the Leeds Hippodrome on 20 March 1899. This {{was his first}} encounter with fellow impresario Sir Oswald Stoll, whose chain had just opened the Leed Empire theatre, whose features and scale had, {{less than two months}} later, brought about the failure of the lessor and resultant sale of the Tivoli to Barrasford. Barrasford noticed that fellow impresario Frank MacNaughten in Bradford had <b>countered</b> the <b>opening</b> of the Stoll Bradford Empire in January 1899, by using an idea pioneered by George [...] "Champagne Charlie" [...] Laybourne in 1870 in his Wear music hall, offering a [...] "twice nightly" [...] performance schedule. The formula proved so successful at not only countering the drop in attendance figures normally experienced in existing theatres facing competition from a new Stoll theatre, but actually increased revenues. Barrasford borrowed MacNaughten's Bradford theatre manager to replicate the system in Leeds, with the choice proving so successful and lucrative, that Barrasford moved his home and the operational headquarters of his business to Leeds.|$|R

40|$|The chapter {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of the role and potential of Arab women in inter-cultural communication through the 21 st century media platforms. Transitioning to a knowledge-based society and economy, so desired by the Arab intelligentsia in the Gulf, can benefit a much larger region, reaching out to the Mediterranean Arab countries and Europe. The author argues that moving from a transnational to a transcultural media system will create new educational platforms and enhance social growth. The chapter explores the evolution of dynamic female involvement in both the pan-Arab and new social media sectors in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Such evolution, if properly managed, might contribute effectively to <b>countering</b> stereotypes and <b>opening</b> up societies to the development of synergies in our media...|$|R

40|$|For the multi-room {{ventilation}} calculations, bi- directional flows or <b>counter</b> {{flows in}} <b>openings</b> have been rarely {{taken into consideration}} and only uni-directional flows have been allowed for the calculation. It {{stands to reason that}} the calculation requires quite sophisticated scheme and the appearance of the bi-directional flows are restricted only to a limited number of openings neighboring the neutral plane of the building and also the flow rates may be too little to affect the total building ventilation. The existence of the bi-directional flows, however, is significant as it may promote the heat exchange between the adjacent rooms and affect the problem in the fire safety or the generation of the ventilation variety. In this paper, the modified ventilation calculation method using the network model is proposed, in which the effect of the bi-directional flows is partially included without the inordinate expansion of the computer capacity. The examination of the existence of the bi-directional flows, the errors in flow rates and the difference of the ventilation modes are investigated with the ordinary and modified ventilation calculations for the stairwell attached two- and three- story houses...|$|R
40|$|In {{the quest}} of globalization, India has <b>countered</b> {{positively}} by <b>opening</b> up its economy, removing controls and resorting to liberalization. Thus, {{to achieve the}} objective of maximum economic efficiency, the liberal trade policy must be complimented through a sound competition policy by preventing anti-competitive business practices and unnecessary government intervention. The Competition Act, 2002 as amended by the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2007, removing the former MRTP Act, 1969, follows the philosophy of modern competition laws and aims at fostering competition and at protecting Indian markets against anti-competitive practices by enterprises. The Act prohibits anticompetitive agreements, abuse of dominant position by enterprises, and regulates entering into combinations (consisting of mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions) with a view to ensure that there is no adverse effect on competition in India. In view of this, this article tries to highlight the issues and challenges contained in the Indian Competition Act, 2002 in ensuring competitive business environment. A good competition policy, along with a sound competition law, should help in fostering competition, economic efficiency, consumer welfare and freedom of trade, which should equip the Governments in meeting the challenges of globalization by increasing competition in local and national markets...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{detection}} efficiency to neutrons {{of a small}} prototype of the KLOE Pb-scintillating fiber calorimeter has been measured at the neutron beam facility of The Svedberg Laboratory, TSL, Uppsala, in the kinetic energy range 5 - 175 MeV. The measurement of the neutron {{detection efficiency}} of a NE 110 scintillator provided a reference calibration. At the lowest trigger threshold, the overall calorimeter efficiency ranges from 40 % to 50 %. This value largely exceeds the estimated 8 - 16 % expected if the response were proportional only to the scintillator equivalent thickness. A detailed simulation of the calorimeter and of the TSL beamline has been performed with the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. The simulated response of the detector to neutrons is presented, {{as well as a}} first data Monte Carlo comparison. The results show an overall neutron efficiency of about 50 %, when no trigger threshold is applied.

40|$|Transportation was a prime {{consideration}} in the business policies of the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s Bay Company from its inception. Although the company legally enjoyed the position of monopoly {{by virtue of the}} Royal Charter of 1670, which granted to the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s Bay Company the Canadian territory called Rupert 2 ̆ 7 s Land, this privilege had to be defended from commercial intruders. From the earliest days the company developed its own transportation network in order to maintain a competitive edge over its opponents. During its first century, when business ventured hardly beyond the shores of the Hudson Bay, the company perfected its transatlantic shipping. Later, when competitors from Montreal moved into the western interior, the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s Bay Company <b>countered</b> by <b>opening</b> several inland rivers, developing a unique wooden craft, the Yorkboat, and constructing rollered passage ways around several rapids. The efficiency of its transportation system enabled the company to defeat all challengers, including the Montreal traders, who were absorbed in 1821. Starving the competition by slashing prices, trading liquor, and deploying its best servants to critical areas were other tactics the company employed to preserve its fur empire. The principal means by which the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s Bay Company defended its trade monopoly, nevertheless, was to maintain an efficient transportation system into Rupert 2 ̆ 7 s Land. By the 1850 s the company 2 ̆ 7 s policy of controlling access to its fur preserve faced an entirely new and potentially fatal challenge. Settlement, with technology based on an expanding agricultural-industrial economy, was rapidly approaching the undeveloped plains. The economic activities of this encroaching civilization foretold death for the fur trade. Several fur empires in other parts of North America had already yielded to the relentless advance of settlement; company officials knew that theirs would also eventually succumb. As early as 1849 Peter Skene Ogden, the chief factor in Oregon, wrote George Simpson, the resident governor of the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s Bay Company, 2 ̆ 2 You are I presume fully aware that the fur trade and civilization can never blend together and experience teaches us that the former invariably gives way to the latter. 2 ̆ 2 Understanding that the fall of the fertile portion of Rupert 2 ̆ 7 s Land to agricultural settlement was inevitable, the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s Bay Company developed a strategy to retain its hold over the fur trade wherever possible and to dominate the commercial potential of the new economic order. Accessibility was the key to the survival plan; realizing that transportation was the vanguard of the new civilization, the company once again decided to control this technology within its domain and to develop it to the company 2 ̆ 7 s own advantage. The most obvious legal threat to the company 2 ̆ 7 s charter came from the province of Canada. This British colony could claim historical, imperial, and juridical ties with Rupert 2 ̆ 7 s Land. During the 1850 s, however, the provincial government did not press claims to the territories. The editor of the Toronto Globe, George Brown, tried to rally his readers to the cause of western annexation-for years his strident editorials praised the Northwest as a panacea for the stagnating economy of Upper Canada-but his proposal remained a minor issue even in his own Clear Grit party and was dismissed as unimportant by the Montreal press. In 1857 a legislative committee, established to investigate the worrisome emigration of young Canadians to the United States, completely ignored the prairies as a haven for prospective farmers and urged instead that they be retained in Canada by means of a vigorous industrialization policy. That same year Canada 2 ̆ 7 s position at the British parliamentary inquiry into the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s Bay Company license was timid and noncommittal. Canada simply could not afford to buyout the company 2 ̆ 7 s charter and trading rights nor could it finance the administration of such a vast domain...|$|R
