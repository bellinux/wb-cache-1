40|$|Background: Some {{studies showed}} a {{relation}} between <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> and osteoarthritis (OA). Hence, considering {{the importance of}} <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> diagnosis andnecessity for its integration with OA, the current study aims at investigating prevalence of <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> in patients above 50 years admitted to Isfahan Al-Zahra Medical Center and its relationship with OA. Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 600 patients who referred to the radiology units of Al-Zahra Hospital for radiography of different joints were studied during 2013 – 2014. The patients images were studied for <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> and OA by a radiologist and also examined clinically and results of imaging by an expert rheumatologist. The prevalence of <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> and it relation with OA was determined by Statistical Package for Social Sciences software and using of Chi-square and t-test. Results: 23 patients under study had <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> (3. 83 %). patients with <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> had higher age average, and they were in age group of 70 years and older, but no significant difference was observed regarding the prevalence of the disease in both genders. <b>Chondrocalcinosis</b> prevalence in terms of body mass index showed significant differences (P = 0. 001). All patients with <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> had a history of joint disease and prevalence of <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> in terms of joint disease history showed a significant difference (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Prevalence of <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> is relatively high in the Iranian population of 70 years and older. Hence, more investigation considering to the diagnosis of <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> among patients with OA is very important...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{undertake}} an {{epidemiological survey}} of the prevalence of radiological <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> in the elderly population of Osona, a rural area of Catalonia, north east Spain. METHODS [...] Knee and wrist radiographs were performed on 261 subjects (141 women, 120 men) aged at least 60 years, who attended a series of 35 general practitioners for various medical problems. RESULTS [...] Twenty seven subjects had articular <b>chondrocalcinosis,</b> which represents a crude prevalence of 10 %. Articular <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> was more often observed in women than in men (14 v 6 %). Articular <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> increases in occurrence with age, rising from 7 % in subjects aged 60 - 69 years to 43 % in subjects older than 80 years. A similar occurrence of articular <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> was noted in the indigenous population, in which several cases of familial <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> have previously been reported, and in subjects born {{in other areas of}} Spain. All but one subject with articular <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> had <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> of the knee.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Chondrocalcinosis</b> is {{frequently}} associated with osteoarthritis. The role of osteoarthritis in the onset and progression of disability is well known. The impact of <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> on disability {{has never been}} investigated in epidemiological studies. METHODS: Progetto Veneto Anziani is a survey of 3099 older Italians, focusing on chronic diseases and disability. Assessment was by questionnaires, physical performance tests and clinical evaluations. <b>Chondrocalcinosis</b> was determined by x-ray readings of 1629 consecutive subjects. Knee and hip osteoarthritis severity was evaluated by summing the radiographic features score (RFS) assigned during x-ray reading. RESULTS: SUBJECTS: with <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> were older and more frequently women (age-adjusted p< 0. 0001). The gender association disappeared following adjustment for osteoarthritis severity. However, at the knee, the prevalence of osteoarthritis was higher in <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> patients independently of age and sex (age-adjusted p< 0. 0001). No difference was found between <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> and controls in sociodemographic variables and comorbidity. Knee <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> was strongly associated with clinical features of knee osteoarthritis and with disability assessment parameters in the bivariate analysis. Most associations remained after adjusting for age.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Certain {{mutations}} in ANKH, which encodes a multiple-pass transmembrane protein that regulates inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) transport, {{are linked to}} autosomal-dominant familial <b>chondrocalcinosis.</b> This study investigated the potential for ANKH sequence variants to promote sporadic <b>chondrocalcinosis.</b> METHODS: ANKH variants identified by genomic sequencing were screened for association with <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> in 128 patients with severe sporadic <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> or pseudogout and in ethnically matched healthy controls. The effects of specific variants on expression of common markers were evaluated by in vitro transcription/translation. The function of these variants was studied in transfected human immortalized CH- 8 articular chondrocytes. RESULTS: Sporadic <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> {{was associated with a}} G-to-A transition in the ANKH 5 '-untranslated region (5 '-UTR) at 4 bp upstream of the start codon (in homozygotes of the minor allele, genotype relative risk 6. 0, P = 0. 0006; overall genotype association P = 0. 02). This - 4 -bp transition, as well as 2 mutations previously linked with familial and sporadic <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> (+ 14 bp C-to-T and C-terminal GAG deletion, respectively), but not the French familial <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> kindred 143 -bp T-to-C mutation, increased reticulocyte ANKH transcription/ANKH translation in vitro.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To analyse the {{association}} between <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> and osteoarthritis (OA) of the hands and knees in an unselected elderly rural population. METHODS [...] A community based cross sectional study was performed in individuals randomly selected from a previous epidemiological survey on the prevalence of <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> in people older than 60 years from Osona county, Catalonia, northeastern Spain. Radiological OA (grade 2 or more of Kellgren's classification) was evaluated in 26 individuals with <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> and in 104 controls. A total of 18 articular areas of both knees (medial and lateral tibiofemoral compartments) and hands (first, second and third metacarpophalangeal (MCP), first carpometacarpal, trapezium-scaphoid, radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joints) were studied. RESULTS [...] Radiological changes of OA in the knees were more common in subjects with <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> than in those without it, with an odds ratio adjusted for age and gender (aOR) of 4. 3 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 6 to 11. 8, p = 0. 005).

Recent findings <b>Chondrocalcinosis</b> is one of a family of conditions associated with ectopic mineralization. This family also includes disorders of mineralization of bone and spinal and other ligaments, and vascular calcification. There has been increasing evidence of the key role of transport and metabolism of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) in control of mineralization, and as the likely explanation for the association of a variety of genetic variants with <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> and ectopic mineralization elsewhere. This may be an overly simplistic view of this family of conditions, with recent evidence suggesting that, for example, ANKH variants may not all predispose to <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> by effects on PPi transport, but may also influence chondrocyte maturation.

The literature is reviewed and reports of previously described associations between Bartter's syndrome and <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> are summarized. The possible role of hypomagnesemia in predisposing to deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal in cartilagine is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceChondrocalcinosis is {{a common}} disease {{occasionally}} associated with hypercalcemia in case of primary hyperparathyroidism. Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (FHH) is a rare and almost always asymptomatic condition, due to an autosomal dominant mutation of the calcium-sensing receptor gene. We report {{the case of a}} 61 -year-old female with chronic hypercalcemia and joint pain. Clinical and biological data revealed <b>chondrocalcinosis</b> associated with FHH. Since primary hyperparathyroidism may mimic FHH, calcium to creatinine clearance ratio should be calculated in every case to avoid a wrong diagnosis and useless parathyroid surgery. The paucity of FFH complications, including <b>chondrocalcinosis,</b> makes their study difficult: additional studies are needed to clearly evaluate the link between FHH and <b>chondrocalcinosis...</b>|$|E
