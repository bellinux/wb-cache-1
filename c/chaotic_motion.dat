The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, <b>chaotic</b> <b>motion.</b> The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E

40|$|By {{means of}} the unsteady-flow theory and a {{bilinear}} mathematical model, a theoretical study is presented for chaotic vibrations associated with the fluid-elastic instability of nonlinearly supported tubes in a crossflow. Effective tools, including phase portraits, power spectral density, Poincare maps, Lyapunov exponent, fractal dimension, and bifurcation diagrams, are utilized to distinguish periodic and <b>chaotic</b> <b>motions</b> when the tubes vibrate in the instability region. The results show periodic and <b>chaotic</b> <b>motions</b> in the region corresponding to fluid-damping-controlled instability.

The sudden change in the character of the stochastic safe basins when the bifurcation parameter of the system passes through a critical value may be defined as an alternative stochastic bifurcation. It is founded that random noise may destroy the integrity of the safe basins, bring forward the occurrence of the stochastic bifurcation, and make the parametric threshold for motions vary in a larger region, hence making the system become more unsafely and <b>chaotic</b> <b>motions</b> may occur more easily...|$|R

30|$|The dynamic {{structures}} of {{ion acoustic waves}} in an unmagnetized plasma with q-nonextensive electrons and positrons are investigated applying the bifurcation theory of planar dynamical systems through direct approach. Model equations are transformed to a planar dynamical system using a traveling wave transformation. Using the bifurcations of planar dynamical system, the existence of solitary and periodic waves is shown. We have obtained new analytical forms for solitary and periodic waves depending on parameters p, q, σ and v. Considering an external periodic perturbation, the chaotic behavior of nonlinear ion acoustic waves is presented. Depending upon different regimes of the nonextensive parameter q, the effect of q is shown on <b>chaotic</b> <b>motions</b> of ion acoustic waves with fixed values of other parameters p,σ and v.
