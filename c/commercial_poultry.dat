40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation was to characterize infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDV) circulating in <b>commercial</b> and breeding <b>poultry</b> farms in Ethiopia between 2009 and 2011. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence for VP 2 hypervariable region of ten IBDVs were determined by RT-PCR, sequenced and compared to well characterised IBDV isolates worldwide. IBDV genetic material was amplified directly from bursa or cell passaged material. Phylogenetically, Ethiopian IBDVs represented two genetic lineages: very virulent (vv) IBDVs or variants of the classical attenuated vaccine strain (D 78). The nucleotide identity between Ethiopian vvIBDVs ranged between 0 % to 2. 6 %. Ethiopian vvIBDVs are clustered phylogenetically with the African IBDV genetic lineage, independent of the Asian/European lineage. This report demonstrates the circulation of vvIBDV in <b>commercial</b> and breeding <b>poultry</b> farms in Ethiopia.

40|$|Mutation and {{recombination}} {{processes are}} involved in the genetic and phenotypic variations of RNA viruses, leading to the emergence of new variant strains, and give rise to virus population diversity to be modeled by the host, particularly by the immune system, as occurred with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in chickens. The consequence is a continuous emergence of new IBV variants with regard to pathotypes, serotypes, and protectotypes. Nucleotide sequencing and subsequent genetic analysis of the S 1 and N protein gene sequences provide a fast and accurate method to classify and predict IBV genotype, and a powerful instrument to monitor phylogenetic and epidemiological evolution of IBV variants. Despite the use of vaccination programmes, infectious bronchitis has become a serious problem in Brazil. Thus, a significant number of IBV field variants have been identified circulating in the Brazilian <b>commercial</b> <b>poultries</b> between 2000 to 2006 and more recently in Argentina. These viruses seem to be indigenous, because they demonstrated a low genetic relatedness with the majority of the reference strains from North America, Europe and Asia, but were moderately to highly related one to another. In summary, indigenous field IBV variants were evolving and circulating in the field in Brazil and Argentina, and should be considered as initial candidates for protection against current IBV infectious in chickens. However, in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to determine the pathogenicity and immunogenecity of these new isolates, before defining a new vaccine strain...|$|R

50|$|A case of {{the virus}} was {{detected}} in Harare, Zimbabwe {{at one of the}} major poultry producers, Irvine's Private Limited. The virus saw over 7,000 birds succumbing to the virus.

Even though a ban on all avian products from Zimbabwe was issued, on 22 June an outbreak was reported at a <b>commercial</b> broiler <b>poultry</b> farm outside Villiers, South Africa after 5,000 chickens died. A few days later, just over 60 km away from the first outbreak, a separate outbreak was reported in Standerton, Mpumalanga, where over 25,000 birds were culled to prevent the virus spreading. The South African Poultry Association reported that wild ducks migrating from Europe are spreading the virus.|$|R
