40|$|Cloacogenic {{carcinoma}} {{is a rare}} tumor {{originating from}} epithelium of the anal transition zone of embryonic residuals. It accounts for only 2 %– 3 % of all neoplasm arising in the anorectal canal and has clinical and morphological characteristics that distinguish them from the ordinary varieties of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell <b>carcinoma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anorectum.</b> We report here {{a case of a}} middle aged male who presented to us with history of altered bowel habits, pain during defecation, passage of fresh blood in stools and pruritus in anal region and on examination there was an ulcerative growth in the anal canal. The diagnosis of basaloid variety of cloacogenic carcinoma was made upon biopsy and histopathological examination. Patient was put on chemoradiation and responded well with complete disappearance of growth macroscopically and clinically but was then lost in follow-up. Owing to the paucity of published literature on this rare malignant tumor this case is being reported here...|$|E
30|$|Primary {{squamous}} cell <b>carcinoma</b> (SCC) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anorectum</b> {{is a very}} rare disease {{and there have been}} few reports regarding SCC in the rectum. Nowadays, chemoradiation therapy (CRT) with 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) plus mitomycin-C (MMC) is the recommended treatment for SCC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anus based on the findings from a small number of clinical trials [1 - 3]; surgery is considered as being a salvage treatment. An optimal treatment for primary SCC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rectum has not been established because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> randomized studies. <b>The</b> choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treatment depends on the tumor characteristics, namely, size, location, depth of tumor cell invasion, and distant metastasis. Recently, some studies have reported that CRT might also be effective in <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> primary SCC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rectum [4 - 9]. Oral fluoropyrimidines including S- 1, tegafur-uracil (UFT), and capecitabine have been developed as a therapeutic alternative to <b>the</b> venous infusion <b>of</b> 5 -FU. S- 1 is an oral anticancer drug composed of tegafur (a prodrug of 5 -FU), 5 -chloro- 2, 4 -dihydropyrimidine (CDHP; gimeracil), and potassium oxonate that has the following benefits. It increases the blood 5 -FU concentration by inhibiting <b>the</b> metabolism <b>of</b> 5 -FU by means of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, and it also enhances <b>the</b> radiation response <b>of</b> colon cancer as compared with 5 -FU.

40|$|Purpose: Transanal {{minimally}} invasive surgery using single port instrumentation is now well described for <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> total mesorectal excision with restorative colorectal/anal anastomosis most-often in conjunction with transabdominal multiport assistance. While non-restorative abdomino-endoscopic perineal excision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anorectum</b> is conceptually similar, it has been less detailed in the literature. Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing non-restorative ano-proctectomy including a transperineal endoscopic component were analysed. All cases commenced laparoscopically with initial medial to lateral mobilisation of any left colon and upper rectum. The lower anorectal dissection started via an intersphincteric or extrasphincteric incision for benign and malignant pathology, respectively, and following suture closure and circumferential mobilisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anorectum,</b> a single port (GelPOINT Path, Applied Medical) was positioned allowing the procedure progress endoscopically in all quadrants up to the cephalad dissection level. Standard laparoscopic instrumentation was used. Specimens were removed perineally. Results: <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 13 patients (median age 55 years, median BMI 28. 75 kg/m 2, median follow-up 17 months, 6 males), ten needed completion proctectomy for ulcerative colitis following prior total colectomy (three with concomitant parastomal hernia repair) while three required abdominoperineal resection for locally advanced rectal cancer following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Median operative time was 190 min, median post-operative discharge day was 7. Eleven specimens were of high quality. Four patients developed perineal wound complications (one chronic sinus, two abscesses needing drainage) within median 17 -month follow-up.

METHODS: Associations were explored in a consecutive series of 162 patients (91 % women, mean age 59 [SD +/- 12] yr) with a mean Vaizey incontinence score of 18 (SD +/- 3). RESULTS: Urge incontinence was reported as "daily" by 55 %, "often" by 27 %, and "sometimes" by 7 % of all patients. No significant associations were observed between <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> urge incontinence and either manometric data, anal mucosal sensitivity testing, or defects of internal anal sphincter (IAS) or external anal sphincter (EAS). A significant relation was observed between <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> urge incontinence and maximal tolerable volume (P= 0. 03) and atrophy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EAS (P= 0. 05).

40|$|Purpose: <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to {{determine}} <b>the</b> possible role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retinoid-mediated signaling pathway in <b>the</b> pathogenesis <b>of</b> anorectal malformations (ARM). The authors investigated whether all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) affects <b>the</b> expression pattern <b>of</b> Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP 4), which play important roles in anorectal morphogenesis in vertebrates. Methods: Pregnant ICR strain mice were fed 100 mg/kg <b>of</b> ATRA on <b>the</b> ninth gestational day (E 9). Embryos with or without administration of ATRA were obtained from the uteri between E 12 and E 16 and were fixed immediately in a 4 % paraformaldehyde solution. Frozen sections were evaluated for concentric layers around the endodermal epithelium by H&E and immunohistochemistry using antibodies created specifically to act against Shh and BMP 4. Results: More than 95 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embryos administered ATRA had ARM; rectoprostatic urethral fistula, rectocloacal fistula, and short tail were the most frequent anomalies in the mouse embryos. On E 14, normal mouse embryos had normal rectum and anus in which <b>the</b> epithelium <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anorectum</b> was positive for Shh, and the mesenchyme was positive for BMP 4. In the ARM embryos, however, <b>the</b> epithelium <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anorectum</b> was negative for Shh, and the mesenchyme was also negative for BMP 4. Conclusions: In normal hindgut development, Shh from the epithelium induces BMP 4 expression in the mesenchyme, which differentiates into the lamina propria and the submucosa. In ARM embryos, expressions of Shh and BMP 4 could not be found in those regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hindgut. Therefore, these findings indicate that Shh and BMP 4, which appear to play a crucial role in organogenesis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hindgut, were disturbed in the cell signaling pathway between the epithelium and the mesenchyme layers. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Context Sexually {{transmitted}} diseases (STDs) {{are a common}} source of presentation to colorectal surgeons. Clinicians need to remain mindful <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> STDs when faced with atypical clinical presentations. This article aims to provide surgeons with a synopsis of common pathogens, their clinical presentations, diagnostic investigations and treatment regimens. Evidence Acquisition The most common bacterial pathogens include Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea with synchronous infections at presentation occurring frequently. Patients often present with proctitis. Gonorrhea patients can also experience bloody purulent perianal discharge. Less common bacterial pathogens include syphilis, chancroid and donovanosis. The commonest STD worldwide remains human papillomavirus. Given its vast array of subtypes its manifestations include benign hyperproliferative lesions like perianal warts and extend to anal intraepithelial neoplasia and squamous cell carcinoma. Other important viral infections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anorectum</b> include human immunodeficiency virus and subsequent acquired immune deficiency disease as well as herpes simplex virus and molluscum contangiosum.
