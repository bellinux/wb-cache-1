A user of the ISO-GUM who is interested in understanding, managing or improving the measurement procedure needs the details, usually expressed as an uncertainty budget, on how the estimate {{for the value of}} the measurand and its associated <b>combined</b> <b>standard</b> <b>uncertainty</b> were calculated. In particular, a user may be interested in quantifying the degrees of contribution to the <b>combined</b> <b>standard</b> <b>uncertainty</b> from its components. When the measurement equation is a linear function of uncorrelated input variables, the contribution from a component is usually quantified by the product of the component of uncertainty and its sensitivity coefficient.

A complicating factor is the presence of a metallic prosthesis in the femur and pelvis, which is becoming more common in elderly populations. The goal of this work was to perform dose measurements to check the accuracy of radiotherapy treatment planning under these complicated conditions. To accomplish this, a scale phantom of an adult pelvic region was used with alanine dosimeters inserted in the prostate region. This phantom was irradiated according to the planned treatment under the following three conditions: with two metallic prostheses in the region of the femur head, with only one prosthesis, and without any prostheses. The <b>combined</b> relative <b>standard</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of dose measurement by electron spin resonance (ESR) /alanine was 5. 05 %, whereas the <b>combined</b> relative <b>standard</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of the applied dose was 3. 35 %, resulting in a <b>combined</b> relative <b>standard</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of the whole process of 6. 06 %.

Along the main fiber link, the forward and backward time signals alternatively pass through the same OEO repeater via a 2 X 2 optical switch (OS). By this means, the optical powers of bidirectional time signals increase. And parts of excess noises, suffered from the main link, are sufficiently blocked owing to the OEO process. Simultaneously, the bidirectional time signals can be decoded and utilized for multi-access time transfer. As {{a result of the}} same devices for both directions, the maximum delay symmetry is maintained, and the performance for multi-access time transfer is guaranteed. With the OEO repeater stations, we successfully demonstrate multi-access time transfer in our time transfer testbeds with the main links up to 13, 200 km.

40|$|Hirshfeld atom {{refinement}} (HAR) is {{a method}} which determines structural parameters from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data by using an aspherical atom partitioning of tailor-made ab initio quantum mechanical molecular electron densities without any further approximation. Here the original HAR method is extended by implementing an iterative procedure of successive cycles of electron density calculations, Hirshfeld atom scattering factor calculations and structural least-squares refinements, repeated until convergence. The importance of this iterative procedure is illustrated via the example of crystalline ammonia. The new HAR method is then applied to X-ray diffraction data of the dipeptide Gly–l-Ala measured at 12, 50, 100, 150, 220 and 295  K, using Hartree–Fock and BLYP density functional theory electron densities and three different basis sets. All positions and anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) are freely refined without constraints or restraints – even those for hydrogen atoms. The results are systematically compared with those from neutron diffraction experiments at the temperatures 12, 50, 150 and 295  K. Although non-hydrogen-atom ADPs differ by up to three <b>combined</b> <b>standard</b> <b>uncertainties</b> (csu's), all other structural parameters agree within less than 2  csu's.

Therefore, inter-laboratory comparisons (ILCs) with independent reference values provided for decades by JRC-IRMM, CEA/CETAMA and US DOE are instrumental to shed light on the current state of practice in measurements of nuclear material and environmental swipe samples. Participating laboratories are requested to report the measurement results with associated uncertainties, and have the possibility to benchmark those results against independent and traceable reference values. The measurement capability of both the IAEA Network of Analytical Laboratories (NWAL) and the nuclear operator's analytical services participating in ILCs can be assessed against the independent reference values as well as against internationally agreed quality goals, in compliance with ISO 13528 : 2005. The quality goals for nuclear material analysis are the relative <b>combined</b> <b>standard</b> <b>uncertainties</b> listed in the ITV 2010. Concerning environmental swipe sample analysis, the IAEA defined measurement quality goals applied in conformity assessment. The paper reports examples from relevant inter-laboratory comparisons, looking at laboratory performance according to the purpose of the measurement and the possible use of the result in line with the IUPAC International Harmonized Protocol and the ISO/IEC 17043 : 2010. Tendencies of laboratories to either overestimate and/or underestimate uncertainties are discussed using straightforward graphical tools to evaluate participants' results, e. g. 'Naji plots'. Finally, we explore the possibility to evaluate laboratories' performances over time and to use conformity assessment to support the safeguards "bottom-up" MBE approach. JRC.
