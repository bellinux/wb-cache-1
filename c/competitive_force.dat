5|$|After a {{full season}} in 1988 and the team's first {{championship}} points, courtesy of Claudio Langes in 1989, {{it became apparent that}} Forti was improving as a <b>competitive</b> <b>force.</b> In 1990, Gianni Morbidelli scored Forti's first victory in an F3000 race, and although no Forti driver won a championship title in this category, the team established itself as a frequent front-runner, scoring nine wins and five pole positions in International F3000. From 1993 onwards, Forti concentrated solely on F3000, and ran drivers such as Naspetti, Fabrizio Giovanardi, Andrea Montermini and Hideki Noda. 1991 was Forti's most successful season in F3000, with Naspetti finishing third in the Drivers' Championship, ten points behind champion Christian Fittipaldi. Although the team's form dipped over subsequent years, by 1994 Forti was the most experienced team in the championship, employing Noda and Pedro Diniz as drivers.|$|E

40|$|Increasingly, {{technological}} innovation {{results from the}} joint creation effort of different players in the value chain, such as suppliers, customers, research centres and universities. Balancing co-operative and <b>competitive</b> <b>forces</b> in the innovation process to co-create value and to capture part of this value has become crucial to profit from innovation. In this article, we show that this tension between value creation and value capture is present in each R&D project. Drawing {{on the case of}} STMicroelectronics, we show that the balance of co-operative and <b>competitive</b> <b>forces</b> in R&D projects is made through the careful alignment of three variables: project knowledge attributes, project governance structure (internal development, co-operation or contracting), and project partner selection (firm or university). The capability to match these three elements explains the success of the innovation process of STMicroelectronics. Building on the experience of this firm, we provide some practical guidance on how managers should trade off these co-operative and <b>competitive</b> <b>forces</b> in organising their R&D projects...|$|R
