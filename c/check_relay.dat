30|$|This {{problem has}} been tackled in various papers in the past. In all these works, the {{importance}} of implementing a fast and accurate grid voltage synchronization algorithm has been highlighted. Reference [3] presents a control method based on the adaptation of a dual second order generalized integrator based on a frequency locked loop (DSOGI-FLL). The algorithm is implemented in a grid-connected power converter that acts as an intelligent connection agent (ICA). The presence of many voltage source converters, however, may deteriorate its effectiveness. Reference [4] proposes an active synchronizing control scheme that also adopts a central based coordinated control for multiple DGs. In [5], the synchronization control system sends remote compensator signals from the substation to the speed and voltage regulators of a hydro plant, achieving safe reconnection. The phase coincidence is addressed only {{by means of a}} synchronism <b>check</b> <b>relay</b> that blocks the reconnection until the phase difference is null. This may delay the transfer for undefined period of time. Reference [6] presents a transfer strategy based on droop control of local microsources providing good results. The algorithm moves the droop equations of the microsources to achieve frequency synchronization and in later stage phase synchronization. However, the second synchronization stage affects the frequency synchronization, while the voltage magnitude coincidence is not addressed. The synchronization system presented in [7] is based on two dual second order generalized integrators (DSOGI) and two stationary reference frames phase locked loop (SRF-PLL) for synchronizing the grid voltage with the capacitor voltage of the converter filter. Besides the requirement of rather complex components, the main consideration here is that during the synchronization process, the droop control is not employed and none of its functions are carried out.|$|E

30|$|Synchronism {{checking}} {{might lead}} complicated procedure and malfunction. Therefore, the individual component {{as well as}} the whole system reliability should be considered. Synchronism <b>checking</b> <b>relays</b> have been produced by several companies and applied in the field. In particular, synchronism checking has been used in the reclosing of transmission lines, and no malfunction in synchronism checking has been reported. Also, with the development of digital signal processing technology, it is possible to accurately obtain the differences in voltage magnitude, frequency, and phase angle between two points. Therefore, this paper does not consider the reclosing failure due to the synchronism checking problems. The conventional distribution systems do not consider synchronism checking in reclosing procedure. If the BESS is disconnected from distribution system during fault, the BESS cannot be used for the UPS. In order to increase the utilization of BESS, the BESS should be connected during a fault, so the synchronism checking must be considered as discussed in introduction. The outage time of faulty phase will be increased due to extra time for synchronism checking. However, the extra time for synchronism checking is actually very short due to a development of digital signal technology. In [23], a time delay of synchronism relay using in power networks is specified. Estabilization time of synchronism relay signals is 30  ms. Time for action of output unit of the synchronism relay is 30  ms. Time set in the synchronism <b>relay</b> for <b>checking</b> depends on the setting of operator, which has usually a delay of 100  ms [23]. Therefore, the closing time delay is usually 160  ms, i.e. about 10 cycles at 60  Hz. In our algorithm, the normal power is supplied to the load by BESS after opening of CB. After that, the time delay for synchronism checking between source and load sides is counted. Therefore, in the simulation results, the reclosing is performed within 1 / 2 cycles after fixed dead time (0.5 or 15  s). This is very short time delay. In other words, the increase of outage time of faulty phase at the proposed scheme will be very short comparing with the conventional reclosing scheme. In summary, by applying proposed reclosing scheme, the interruptions of healthy phases will be prevented and hence the reliability will improve. Also, the increase of outage time of faulty phase will not affect to the reliability.|$|R

If it is sufficient, then the optimum solution corresponds to this particular situation in which the full relay power is not used.

We discuss the two leading contactless EMV payment protocols (Visa’s payWave and Mas-terCard’s PayPass). Stopping a relay attack against cards using these protocols is hard: either the overhead of the communication is low compared to the (cryp-tographic) computation by the card or the messages can be cached before they are requested by the terminal. We propose a solution that fits within the EMV Contactless specification to make a payment protocol that is resistant to re-lay attacks from commercial off-the-shelf devices, such as mobile phones. This solution does not require significant changes to the cards and can easily be added to existing terminals.

These values are subjected to a threshold to distinguish reliable decoded bits. The relay then forwards bits that are deemed reliable and discards bits that are not, resulting in less errors propagating to the destination. We develop upper bounds on the end-to-end bit error rate, enabling us to optimize the threshold in terms of the minimum end-to-end bit error rate.

40|$|Abstract This {{deliverable}} provides comprehensive {{theoretical and}} simulation {{results on the}} proposed power optimization algorithms with four toy scenarios identified in the project. The proposed algorithms mainly assume that the statistical channel knowledge and/or location information are available at each node, which aims to be in line with RESCUE “links-on-the-fly” concept. Specifically, the outage probability based joint power allocation and relay position for lossy-forwarding relaying scheme is firstly investigated in toy scenario one, and then the work is extended to a symbol-level selective transmission scheme. For toy scenario two, compared with our previous work in D 2. 2. 1, the outage probability based power allocation is extended to multi-relay case, meanwhile, the power allocation from rate distortion perspective is also investigated. Furthermore, the outage probability based power allocation for toy scenario three is presented for the first time, and the orthogonal multiple access relay channel based power allocation is also illustrated for the case with more than two sources. Based on the provided results, the proposed algorithms exhibit improved performances by comparing with the conventional schemes, e. g., equal-power allocation. Executive summary Recall the Links-on-the-fly Technology for Robust, Efficient, and Smart Communication in Unpredictable Environments (RESCUE) concept that relays are allowed to decode-and-forward the received frames with specified level of errors, which aims to provide efficient and simple information transfer. In this case, the error propagation effects can be mitigated at destination with modified distributed turbo decoding by taking source-relay link correlation information into account. Alternatively, relays can also predict the positions of decoding errors in a frame and then null out {{them in order to}} mitigate the error propagation effects. Both of these strategies have a common assumption that channel feedback from reception node to transmission node is not allowed. Thus, the optimal power allocation cannot be based on the knowledge of instantaneous channel state information (CSI). However, we can still use statistical CSI and/or nodes’ location information obtained through long term observation and training. In this deliverable, a comprehensive review of the proposed power allocation algorithms with statistical channel knowledge and/or nodes’ location information for different identified toy scenarios is presented. Firstly, the joint optimization of power allocation (PA) and relay position (RP) for lossy-forwarding relaying is proposed, where the objective is to minimize the system outage probability of toy scenario one (TS 1). With the closed-form expression of the outage probability, we investigate adaptive PA with fixed RP, adaptive RP with fixed PA ratio, and joint optimization of PA and RP under total transmit power constraint. It is found that the proposed three algorithms outperform the equal PA, midpoint RP, and semi-adaptive optimization algorithms, respectively. Moreover, we also consider the optimal PA and RP for a symbol-level selective transmission at relay scheme. In this case, the optimal power allocation is to maximize the average received signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio at destination, where the SNR expression includes the derived probability of correctly predicted/forwarded symbols per frame at relay. It is shown that, within four presented relay locations, relay closed to destination provides the best average SNR performance, and its optimal power allocation happens when the relay is allocated with more power. As investigated in D 2. 2. 1, the power allocation in order to minimize the system outage for two relays based chief executive officer (CEO) problem provides better performance than the ones with equal power allocation. In this deliverable, we extend the work with three or more relays cases and propose a simple, yet effective power allocation scheme based on the Slepian-Wolf theorem. Moreover, we also assess the performance of the proposed power allocation for a practical joint decoding (JD) introduced in literature, and the improved performances in terms of average bit-error-rate (BER) can be observed. In addition, we also investigate the optimal power allocation for the lossy communication networks in toy scenario two (TS 2). Specifically, we consider the power allocation from rate distortion perspective in order to achieve optimum distortion under total power constraints. The problem can be formulated as convex optimization framework and solved by using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. In this deliverable, we introduce the optimal power allocation in toy scenario three (TS 3) for the first time. Based on the derived outage upper bound presented in deliverable D 1. 2. 2, we design the power allocation strategy to minimize the outage upper bound subject to the total transmission power constraints. It is shown that the proposed power allocation strategy can be asymptotically optimal at high SNR range. Similar as the ones for TS 2, we also assess the performance of the proposed power allocation strategy for a practical JD scheme. An improved performance in terms of frame-error-rate (FER) is also observed. Comparing with the work for toy scenario four (TS 4) in D 2. 2. 1, we generalize the power allocation problem of lossy forwarding based multiple access relay channel for two sources, single relay and common destination case to more than two sources case. Here, we propose a heuristic power allocation approach for fading channels with the average SNR of each link. The objective of the problem is to minimize the transmit power subject to rate constants, and the non-convex based power allocation problem can still be solved with successive convex approximation method. Numerical results show that the proposed method provides better performances than the conventional cyclic redundancy <b>check</b> based DF <b>relaying</b> in terms of power assumption and outage probability. To sum up, the above mentioned power allocation algorithms for different toy scenarios are implemented mainly based on statistical channel knowledge and/or nodes’ location information, which can be obtained from long terms observation and training. This is consistent with RESCUE “links-on-the-fly” concept, where the signalling to guarantee reliable transmission for a specific link is not allowed in unpredictable environments...|$|R
