40|$|When {{employing}} hydraulic {{processes to}} increase gas drainage efficiency in underground coal mines, coal seams become a three-phase medium, containing water intruding into the coal pores with the inherent occurrence of gas. This {{can change the}} stress state of the coal and cause instability. This work studied the mechanical properties of <b>coal</b> containing <b>water</b> and <b>gas</b> and derived an appropriate failure criterion. Based on mixture theory of unsaturated porous media, the effective stress of coal, considering the interaction of <b>water</b> and <b>gas,</b> was analyzed, and the failure criterion established by combining this with the Mohr–Coulomb criterion. By introducing the stress factor of matrix suction and using fitted curves of experimentally determined matrix suction and moisture content, the relationships between coal strength, gas pressure, and moisture content were determined. To verify the established strength theory, a series of triaxial compression strength tests of <b>coal</b> containing <b>water</b> and <b>gas</b> were carried out on samples taken from the Songzao, Pingdingshan, and Tashan mines in China. The experimental results correlated well with the theoretical predictions. The results showed a linear decrease in the peak strength of coal with increasing gas pressure and an exponential reduction in peak strength with increasing moisture content. The strength theory of <b>coal</b> containing <b>water</b> and <b>gas</b> can become {{an important part of}} multiphase medium damage theory...|$|R

40|$|Coal seam gas {{operations}} produce significant {{quantities of}} associated water which often require demineralization. Ion exchange with natural zeolites {{has been proposed}} as a possible approach. The interaction of natural zeolites with solutions of sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate in addition to <b>coal</b> seam <b>gas</b> <b>water</b> is not clear. Hence, we investigated ion exchange kinetics, equilibrium, and column behaviour of an Australian natural zeolite. Kinetic tests suggested that the pseudo first order equation best simulated the data. Intraparticle diffusion {{was part of the}} rate limiting step and more than one diffusion process controlled the overall rate of sodium ion uptake. Using a constant mass of zeolite and variable concentration of either sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate resulted in a convex isotherm which was fitted by a Langmuir model. However, using a variable mass of zeolite and constant concentration of sodium ions revealed that the exchange of sodium ions with the zeolite surface sites was in fact unfavourable. Sodium ion exchange from bicarbonate solutions (10. 3 g Na/kg zeolite) was preferred relative to exchange from sodium chloride solutions (6. 4 g Na/kg zeolite). The formation of calcium carbonate species was proposed to explain the observed behaviour. Column studies of <b>coal</b> seam <b>gas</b> <b>water</b> showed that natural zeolite had limited ability to reduce the concentration of sodium ions (loading 2. 1 g Na/kg zeolite) with rapid breakthrough observed. It was concluded that natural zeolites may not be suitable for the removal of cations from <b>coal</b> seam <b>gas</b> <b>water</b> without improvement of their physical properties...|$|R

40|$|Common to {{many types}} of water and {{wastewater}} {{is the presence of}} sodium ions which can be removed by desalination technologies, such as reverse osmosis and ion exchange. The focus of this investigation was ion exchange as it potentially offered several advantages compared to competing methods. The equilibrium and column behaviour of a strong acid cation (SAC) resin was examined for the removal of sodium ions from aqueous sodium chloride solutions of varying normality as well as a <b>coal</b> seam <b>gas</b> <b>water</b> sample. The influence of the bottle-point method to generate the sorption isotherms was evaluated and data interpreted with the Langmuir Vageler, Competitive Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Astakhov models. With the constant concentration bottle point method, the predicted maximum exchange levels of sodium ions on the resin ranged from 61. 7 to 67. 5 g Na/kg resin. The general trend was that the lower the initial concentration of sodium ions in the solution, the lower the maximum capacity of the resin for sodium ions. In contrast, the constant mass bottle point method was found to be problematic in that the isotherm profiles may not be complete, if experimental parameters were not chosen carefully. Column studies supported the observations of the equilibrium studies, with maximum sodium loading of ca. 62. 9 g Na/kg resin measured, which was in excellent agreement with the predictions of the data from the constant concentration bottle point method. Equilibria involving <b>coal</b> seam <b>gas</b> <b>water</b> were more complex due to the presence of sodium bicarbonate in solution, albeit the maximum loading capacity for sodium ions was in agreement with the results from the more simple sodium chloride solutions...|$|R
40|$|This University of Florida report {{examines}} some of {{the issues}} relating to the future of transportation fuels. The study gave particular emphasis to the likely paths that could potentially provide transition from current petroleum-based liquid transportation fuels to a full-blown “hydrogen economy. ” Paramount among the potential transition path questions are whether an intermediate fuel will be necessary to ease the petroleum to hydrogen economy transition and, if so, what are likely candidate fuels. It was obvious from the outset that the quantities of energy associated with transportation are already enormous globally and domestically, and that these energy requirements are likely to increase, probably dramatically, as China and other large-population countries expand their automobile and truck use to ever larger fractions of the population. These transportation energy requirements eliminate all but a few options for fuel feedstocks and provide indication of the magnitude of cost and difficulty in achieving a true hydrogen-transportation fuel capability. Based on the limited options for transportation fuel feedstocks, consideration in this study was limited to natural <b>gas,</b> <b>coal</b> and <b>water.</b> Natural <b>gas</b> is already being used, in a very limite...|$|R

30|$|The paper {{reports the}} effects of surface fractal {{structures}} on the rheological behavior and combustion kinetics of raw brown coal and three modified <b>coal</b> <b>water</b> slurries (CWSs).

The apparent viscosities of the <b>coal</b> <b>water</b> slurries increase with increasing surface fractal dimensions (D), especially with decreasing shear rates. Furthermore, it has been proved that the ignition temperatures and apparent activation energies of modified CWSs are lower than that of raw <b>coal</b> <b>water</b> slurry.

40|$|Coal seam gas (CSG) {{exploration}} and development requires the abstraction of significant amounts of water. This is so because gas desorbtion in coal seams takes place only after aquifer pressure has been reduced by prolonged pumping of aquifer water. CSG waters have a specific geochemical signature which {{is a product of}} their formation process. These waters have high bicarbonate, high sodium, low calcium, low magnesium, and very low sulphate concentrations. Additionally, chloride concentrations may be high depending on the coal depositional environment. This particular signature is not only useful for exploration purposes, but it also highlights potential environmental issues that can arise as a consequence of CSG water disposal. Since 2002 L&M Coal Seam Gas Ltd and CRL Energy Ltd, have been involved in {{exploration and}} development of CSG in New Zealand.

CSG is natural gas that has been produced through thermogenic and biogenic processes in underground coal seams; CSG extraction requires the abstraction of significant amounts of CSG water. To date, no international literature has described <b>coal</b> seam <b>gas</b> <b>water</b> in New Zealand, however recent CSG exploration work has resulted in CSG water quality data from a coal seam in Maramarua, New Zealand. Water quality from this site closely follows the geochemical signature associated with United States CSG waters, and this has helped to characterise the type of water being abstracted. CSG water from this part of Maramarua has low calcium, magnesium, and sulphate concentrations but high sodium (334 mg/l), chloride (146 mg/l) and bicarbonate (435 mg/l) concentrations. In addition, this water has high pH (7. 8) and alkalinity (360 mg/l as CaCO 3), which is a direct consequence of carbonate dissolution and biogenic processes.
