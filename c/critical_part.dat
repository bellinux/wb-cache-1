5|$|In the 1960s, the Hammond B-3 organ {{became a}} <b>critical</b> <b>part</b> of the Baltimore jazz scene, led by virtuoso Jimmy Smith. The Left Bank Jazz Society {{also played a}} major role locally, hosting concerts and {{promoting}} performers. The popularity of jazz, however, declined greatly {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century, with an aging and shrinking audience, though the city continued producing local performers and hosting a vibrant jazz scene.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{polonium}} {{was produced}} {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project's Dayton Project during World War II. It was a <b>critical</b> <b>part</b> of the implosion-type nuclear weapon design used in the Fat Man bomb on Nagasaki in 1945. Polonium and beryllium were the key ingredients of the 'urchin' detonator {{at the center of the}} bomb's spherical plutonium pit.

5|$|Stephen's wife Matilda {{played a}} <b>critical</b> <b>part</b> {{in keeping the}} King's cause alive during his captivity. Queen Matilda {{gathered}} Stephen's remaining lieutenants around her and the royal family in the south-east, advancing into London when the population rejected the Empress. Stephen's long-standing commander William of Ypres remained with the queen in London; William Martel, the royal steward, commanded operations from Sherborne in Dorset, and Faramus of Boulogne ran the royal household. The queen appears to have generated genuine sympathy and support from Stephen's more loyal followers. Henry's alliance with the Empress proved short-lived, as they soon fell out over political patronage and ecclesiastical policy; the bishop met Stephen's wife Queen Matilda at Guildford and transferred his support to her.|$|E

Yet {{the life of an}} engine is in reality determined by wear of the <b>critical</b> <b>parts.</b> Even if an engine is designed and built to have normal wear life, abnormal wear takes place either due to special working conditions or increased loading.   Understanding abnormal and normal wear enables the engineer to control the external conditions leading to premature wear, or to design the <b>critical</b> <b>parts</b> that have longer wear life and hence lower costs.

5|$|Although {{not without}} conflict, European Canadians' early {{interactions}} with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples played a <b>critical</b> <b>part</b> {{in the development}} of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The Crown and indigenous peoples began interactions during the European colonization period, though the Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European settlers. However, from the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture. These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations. A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{culture has}} {{historically}} been influenced by Indigenous, French and British cultures and traditions. Most of Canada's territory was inhabited and developed later than other European colonies in the Americas, {{with the result that}} themes and symbols of pioneers, trappers, and traders were important in the early development of the Canadian identity. First Nations played a <b>critical</b> <b>part</b> in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The British conquest of New France in the mid-1700s brought a large Francophone population under British Imperial rule, creating a need for compromise and accommodation. The new British rulers left alone much of the religious, political, and social culture of the French-speaking habitants, guaranteeing through the Quebec Act of 1774 the right of the Canadiens to practise the Catholic faith and to use French civil law (now Quebec law).|$|E
5|$|In November 1942, Koppelman {{was drafted}} into the United States Army and in 1943 he married painter Dorothy Myers. He worked as a radio {{weatherman}} during World War II, guiding ships through the rough waters of the English Channel, which was a <b>critical</b> <b>part</b> of the Invasion of Normandy. He manned an anti-aircraft machine gun in the D-Day landing on Omaha Beach, and later, as staff sergeant, was awarded a Bronze Star. Before the invasion, {{he had been able}} to study at the Art College of Western England in Bristol, and later at the École des Beaux-Arts in Reims. While on leave, he visited Picasso's studio in Paris, and it was Picasso and Louis Aragon who told Koppelman that the war in Europe was over. Letters describing his wartime experience are in the Chaim and Dorothy Koppelman papers at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.|$|E

40|$|This Study was {{conducted}} at PT. Pertamina EP located at Jakarta in order to analyze reliability of machines that used in that company. This study is to suggest the company {{the picture of the}} aspect that still inefficient in the operational system. This study is using prime and secondary data with water injection pump type GASO 3364 - 7 as the study object that located in business, explorations and production unit (UBEP) Jambi. the data is collected from spare part changes within 2011 - 2012 period. Using ABC analysis, the <b>critical</b> <b>parts</b> within the machines will be sorted out and each of the <b>critical</b> <b>parts</b> will be measured the mean time between failure with comparing the total uptime of the spare part and total breakdown per critical component in that period of time. As the result of the study, can be concluded that water injection pump machine, with 3 month averages will have a breakdown that involving the <b>critical</b> <b>parts.</b> The recommendation is, the management has to pay attention at the inventory level of <b>critical</b> <b>parts</b> so it can be more efficient where is the inventory level is not bigger than usage level considering <b>critical</b> <b>parts</b> have high price above all parts that will make higher inventory cost if the supply is more than usage and lack of inventory will causing major shutdown that will cost company some costly opportunity.
