40|$|We {{discuss the}} effects of isospin {{breaking}} which appear in the vertex <b>corrections</b> <b>for</b> Zb b̅, Zτ^+τ^- and Wντ in a one-family technicolor model without exact custodial symmetry. By means of the effective lagrangian approach we compute the vertex <b>corrections</b> <b>for</b> Zbb̅, Zττ and Wτν taking account of the contributions from technivectormesons. If the isospin symmetry in technilepton sector is not exact, technivectormesons contribute to the vertex <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> Zττ but such contributions to the <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> Wτν are absent.

40|$|Multiple-choice (MC) {{examinations}} {{are becoming}} increasingly popular in higher education {{because they can be}} used effectively to assess breadth of knowledge in large cohorts of students. This present research investigated Psychology students' performance on, and experiences of, MC examinations with and without <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> guessing. In Study 1, data were collected from two cohorts of students across three Psychology MC examinations. The results revealed that students scored higher, and left fewer questions unanswered, when there was no <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> guessing. Furthermore, when the <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> guessing was removed from the theory MC examination, students who were told there was no <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> guessing did better than those told there was a correction. In addition, there was limited evidence of gender differences, with female students performing significantly better on one MC examination than males. In Study 2, a further set of first-year Psychology students reported their experiences of <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> guessing on open-book and closed-book MC examinations. Students reported feeling less anxious and more confident on the open-book MC examination. The findings of both of these studies have implications for instructors deciding whether or not <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> guessing is appropriate, and for the advice to be given to students preparing for MC examinations...|$|R
