25|$|Various {{methods are}} used to {{encourage}} the formation of locks such as backcombing, braiding, rolling and the <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> method. All of these methods require ongoing work {{to be applied to}} the dread before it becomes neat and tight or mature. However, if the <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> method is applied by a skilled hand throughout the length of the dread, then the resulting dreadlocks are instantly tight and will not need any rolling.|$|E
25|$|A hairpin loom {{is often}} used to create lacy and long stitches, known as hairpin lace. While this is not in itself a hook, it is a device used in {{conjunction}} with a <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> to produce stitches.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding the {{categorical}} {{assertion of}} a purely British origin, there is solid {{evidence of a}} connection between French tambour embroidery and crochet. The former method of production was illustrated in detail in 1763 in Diderot's Encyclopedia. The tip of the needle shown there is indistinguishable {{from that of a}} present-day inline <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> and the chain stitch separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique. The 1823 Penélopé instructions unequivocally state that the tambour tool was used for crochet and the first of the 1840s instruction books uses the terms tambour and crochet as synonyms. This equivalence is retained in the 4th edition of that work, 1847.|$|E
50|$|The {{division}} between yarn and thread is somewhat arbitrary: crochet thread at its thickest {{is similar in}} diameter and behavior to fine cotton yarn. The largest sizes of thread <b>crochet</b> <b>hooks</b> overlap with the smallest sizes of yarn <b>crochet</b> <b>hooks.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Crochet</b> <b>hooks</b> {{used for}} Tunisian crochet are {{elongated}} {{and have a}} stopper {{at the end of}} the handle, while double-ended <b>crochet</b> <b>hooks</b> have a hook on both ends of the handle. There is also a double hooked apparatus called a Cro-hook that has become popular.|$|R
25|$|Aluminium, bamboo, {{and plastic}} <b>crochet</b> <b>hooks</b> are {{available}} from 2.5 to 19 millimeters in size, or from B to S in American sizing.|$|R
25|$|The <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> {{comes in}} many sizes and materials, such as bone, bamboo, aluminium, plastic, and steel. Because sizing is {{categorized}} by {{the diameter of}} the hook's shaft, a crafter aims to create stitches of a certain size in order to reach a particular gauge specified in a given pattern. If gauge is not reached with one hook, another is used until the stitches made are the needed size. Crafters may have a preference for one type of hook material over another due to aesthetic appeal, yarn glide, or hand disorders such as arthritis, where bamboo or wood hooks are favored over metal for the perceived warmth and flexibility during use. Hook grips and ergonomic hook handles are also available to assist crafters.|$|E

2500|$|Round or {{cylindrical}} {{patterns are}} simple to produce {{with a regular}} <b>crochet</b> <b>hook,</b> but cylindrical knitting requires either a set of circular needles or three to five special double-ended needles. [...] Many crocheted items are composed of individual motifs which are then joined together, either by sewing or crocheting, whereas knitting is usually composed of one fabric, such as entrelac.|$|E
25|$|Steel <b>crochet</b> <b>hooks</b> {{range in}} size from 0.4 to 3.5 millimeters, or from 00 to 16 in American sizing. These hooks are used for fine crochet work such as doilies and lace.|$|R
25|$|A needle gauge {{makes it}} {{possible}} to determine the size of a knitting needle. Some may also be used to gauge the size of <b>crochet</b> <b>hooks.</b> Most needles come with the size written on them, but with use and time, the label often wears off, and many needles (like double-pointed needles) tend not to be labelled.|$|R

2500|$|Crochet ( [...] ; [...] ) is {{a process}} of {{creating}} fabric by interlocking loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials using a <b>crochet</b> <b>hook.</b> The name is derived from the French term crochet, meaning 'small hook'. These are made of materials such as metal, wood, or plastic and are manufactured commercially and produced in artisan workshops. The salient difference between crochet and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in crochet is completed before proceeding with the next one, while knitting keeps a large number of stitches open at a time. (Variant forms such as Tunisian crochet and broomstick lace keep multiple crochet stitches open at a time.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{very simple}} cases, {{knitting}} {{can be done}} without tools, using only the fingers to do these tasks; however, knitting is usually carried out using tools such as knitting needles, knitting machines or rigid frames. [...] Depending on their size and shape, the rigid frames are called stocking frames, knitting boards, knitting rings (also called knitting looms) or knitting spools (also known as knitting knobbies, knitting nancies, or corkers). [...] There is also a technique called knooking of knitting with a <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> that has a cord attached to the end, to hold the stitches while they're being worked. Other tools are used to prepare yarn for knitting, to measure and design knitted garments, or to make knitting easier or more comfortable.|$|E
2500|$|Various tools {{have been}} {{developed}} to make hand-knitting easier. [...] Tools for measuring needle diameter and yarn properties have been discussed above, as well as the yarn swift, ballwinder and [...] "yarntainers". [...] Crochet hooks and a darning needle are often useful in binding/casting off or in joining two knitted pieces edge-to-edge. [...] The darning needle is used in duplicate stitch (also known as Swiss darning). The <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> is also essential for repairing dropped stitches and some specialty stitches such as tufting. [...] Other tools such as knitting spools or pom-pom makers are used to prepare specific ornaments. [...] For large or complex knitting patterns, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of which stitch should be knit in a particular way; therefore, several tools {{have been developed}} to identify the number of a particular row or stitch, including circular stitch markers, hanging markers, extra yarn and row counters. [...] A second potential difficulty is that the knitted piece will slide off the tapered end of the needles when unattended; this is prevented by [...] "point protectors" [...] that cap the tapered ends. [...] Another problem is that too much knitting may lead to hand and wrist troubles; for this, special stress-relieving gloves are available. In traditional Shetland knitting a special belt is often used to support the end of one needle allowing the knitting greater speed. Finally, there are sundry bags and containers for holding knitting, yarns and needles.|$|E

The shop is regularly used as a venue for the knitting club and other events, including classes, film nights, a book group (The Kniterati), late night opening and is the first knitting shop in the UK with a licensed bar selling alcoholic drinks.|$|R
5000|$|The larvae have {{distinctive}} morphology. Their head capsule is {{well developed}} dorsally, {{and they have}} long abdominal prolegs with <b>crocheted</b> <b>hooks.</b> These structures help the larvae move without being washed away in their preferred larval habitat, fast flowing montane streams and torrents. The larvae are predators of other aquatic invertebrates such as caddisflies. Adults have stout, tapered abdomens with slightly elongate legs, with aristate antennae. Males are sexually dimorphic with holoptic eyes.|$|R
50|$|The {{suborder}} Symphyta {{includes the}} sawflies, horntails, and parasitic wood wasps. The group may be paraphyletic, {{as it has}} been suggested that the family Orussidae may be the group from which the Apocrita arose. They have an unconstricted junction between the thorax and abdomen. The larvae are herbivorous, free-living eruciforms, with three pairs of true legs, prolegs (on every segment, unlike Lepidoptera) and ocelli. The prolegs do not have <b>crochet</b> <b>hooks</b> at the ends unlike the larvae of the Lepidoptera.|$|R

5000|$|Chain cast-on : Uses a <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> or two {{knitting}} needles. To execute, hold a {{knitting needle}} in {{left hand and}} <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> or second knitting needle in right hand. Make a slip-knot in yarn {{and put it on}} the <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> or right-hand needle. Wrap the yarn from the back of the left-hand needle and over to the front, over the <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> or right needle, pass the slip-knot loop over the wrap, leaving the new loop on the <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> or right needle. Repeat, wrapping the yarn over the left-hand needle before passing it over the <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> or right needle to make a new loop, until you have one less stitch than required. Place the last loop on the left-hand needle as the first stitch that will be worked. This cast-on creates an edge that mimics a standard bind-off edge.|$|E
5000|$|Cro-tatting {{combines}} needle tatting with crochet. The cro-tatting tool is a tatting needle with a <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> at the end. One {{can also}} cro-tat with a bullion <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> {{or a very}} straight <b>crochet</b> <b>hook.</b> In the 19th century, [...] "crochet tatting" [...] patterns were published which simply called for a <b>crochet</b> <b>hook.</b> One of the earliest patterns is for a crocheted afghan with tatted rings forming a raised design. [...] Patterns are available in English and are equally divided between yarn and thread. In its most basic form, the rings are tatted with a length of plain thread between them, as in single-shuttle tatting. In modern patterns, {{beginning in the early}} 20th century, the rings are tatted and the arches or chains are crocheted. Many people consider cro-tatting more difficult than crochet or needle tatting. Some tatting instructors recommend using a tatting needle and a <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> to work cro-tatting patterns. Stitches of cro-tatting (and needle tatting before a ring is closed) unravel easily, unlike tatting made with a shuttle.|$|E
50|$|Small gauge <b>crochet</b> <b>hooks</b> or {{knitting}} needles are typically used {{to achieve a}} tight gauge that does not allow the stuffing to show through the fabric. Stuffing can be standard polyester, wool, or cotton craft stuffing, but may be improvised from other materials. Wires, such as pipe cleaners or floral wire, {{may be used to}} make the doll posable. Plastic pellets, glass pebbles, and even stones may be inserted beneath the stuffing to distribute weight {{at the bottom of the}} figure.|$|R

Jimmy Beans Wool made $7 million in revenue in 2013 and $8 million in revenue in 2014. In October 2015, the company launched Beanie Bags, a monthly subscription which sends customers four different yarn samples, links to patterns, and small items such as <b>crochet</b> <b>hooks</b> and knitting needles. By November 2015, Beanie Bags had 5,400 customers subscribed.|$|R
50|$|Crochet {{appeared}} as a distinct textile art during the early 19th-century and many <b>crochet</b> <b>hooks</b> survive from that period. These can be sorted into two groups, the one with thin steel hooks that are set into separate handles, and the other including single-piece hooks made {{in a variety of}} materials. The distinction between steel and other hooks persists to the present day, although all are now commonly of single-piece construction. A variety of coverings may be applied to the handle for ergonomic reasons. Ornate handles have been made for their decorative value, throughout.|$|R

50|$|Crochet {{manufacturing}} conventions treat {{thread and}} yarn quite differently: manufacturers designate different sizing scales for thread and yarn. Thread is generally packaged on spools instead of skeins or hanks and is {{offered for sale}} in a separate section from ordinary yarns or threads. <b>Crochet</b> <b>hooks</b> for use with thread are also sized according to a different scale from yarn hooks. Thread hooks are also manufactured differently from yarn hooks: modern yarn hooks are usually aluminum or plastic, while thread hooks are made of steel and have smaller hook heads and shorter shanks.|$|R
50|$|Not all {{of society}} was {{accepting}} of contraceptives or abortion, {{and the opposition}} viewed both as part of {{one and the same}} sin. Abortion was much more common among the middle classes than among those living in rural areas, where the procedure was not readily available. Women were often tricked into purchasing ineffective pills. In addition to fearing legal reprimands, many physicians did not condone abortion because they viewed it as an immoral procedure potentially endangering a woman's life. Because abortion was illegal and physicians refused to perform the procedure, local women acted as abortionists, often using <b>crochet</b> <b>hooks</b> or similar instruments.|$|R
5000|$|The {{familiar}} {{symbol of}} illegal abortion is the infamous [...] "coat hanger" [...] — {{which may be}} the symbol, but is in no way a myth. In my years in New York, several women arrived with a hanger still in place. Whoever put it in — perhaps the patient herself — found it trapped in the cervix and could not remove it....However, not simply coat hangers were used.Almost any implement you can imagine had been and was used to start an abortion — darning needles, <b>crochet</b> <b>hooks,</b> cut-glass salt shakers, soda bottles, sometimes intact, sometimes with the top broken off.|$|R

50|$|Crocheting differs {{largely from}} {{knitting}} {{in that there}} is only one loop, not the multitude as knitting has. Also, instead of knitting needles, a <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> is used.|$|E
50|$|Tunisian crochet {{can also}} be worked in the round, as when making a {{seamless}} cap. To work in the round a double-ended <b>crochet</b> <b>hook</b> and two balls of yarn are used. The first hook and ball of yarn are used to add loops (casting on). When the process is reversed (as described above), the loops are worked off using the second hook and second ball of yarn. When using a flexible cable to connect the two ends of the double-ended <b>crochet</b> <b>hook,</b> a single ball of yarn is sufficient.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crochet</b> <b>hooks</b> are {{currently}} produced in diameters ranging from 0.35 mm to 25 mm. These diameters are indicated both directly in millimeters and by various numerical or literal gauge systems. Hooks under 2.0 mm {{are made of}} steel (for its strength) and are alternately termed steel-, lace- or thread hooks. Hooks of 2.00 mm or larger diameter are called yarn hooks or regular hooks. Aluminum is the predominant material from 2.0 mm to 6.0 mm (for its lighter weight). Beyond that, bamboo, wood, and plastic are the more common materials (for their even lighter weight). The indicated size boundaries between the types are, however, approximate. With {{the exception of the}} thinnest hooks, which are invariably made of steel, other materials may be encountered outside the indicated ranges.|$|R
50|$|The {{thickness}} or {{weight of}} the yarn is {{a significant factor in}} determining the gauge, i.e., how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern. Thicker yarns generally require large-diameter <b>crochet</b> <b>hooks,</b> whereas thinner yarns may be crocheted with thick or thin hooks. Hence, thicker yarns generally require fewer stitches, and therefore less time, to work up a given project. Patterns and motifs are coarser with thicker yarns and produce bold visual effects, whereas thinner yarns are best for refined or delicate patternwork. Yarns are standardly grouped by thickness into six categories: superfine, fine, light, medium, bulky and superbulky. Quantitatively, thickness is measured by the number of wraps per inch (WPI). The related weight per unit length is usually measured in tex or denier.|$|R
