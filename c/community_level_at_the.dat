40|$|The {{combination}} of the retraction of TRAP and the merger of LOT and THOUGHT {{can be found in}} a number of English dialects. Gordon (2005) has suggested that the merger of LOT and THOUGHT creates a margin of security in which TRAP may retract, and that TRAP-retraction might therefore be expected to be found anywhere the low-back vowel merger exists. This work presents data showing the {{combination of}} these two kinds of vowel variation among emerging adult speakers in Illinois. F 1 and F 2 were measured for TRAP, LOT, and THOUGHT tokens taken from word list recitation and interview speech data for 26 emerging adult speakers from Southern Illinois, Chicagoland, and I- 55 Corridor. The data clearly show that speakers in Southern Illinois engage in forms of both TRAP-retraction and the low-back vowel merger. While finding the low-back vowel merger in a South Midland U. S. dialect is unsurprising, the discovery of a well backed TRAP vowel (often further back than the F 2 grand mean) in this region is novel. By interpreting the position of TRAP as a function of the degree of low-back vowel merger (i. e., always merged, occasionally merged, or always distinct), we see that Gordon’s suggestion is borne out at the community level. However, the functionalist argument underlying Gordon’s suggestion (i. e., that the retraction of TRAP follows as a result of the “vacuum” in vowel space created by the low-back vowel merger) is not entirely upheld. Though TRAP-retraction and the low-back vowel merger are linked at the <b>community</b> <b>level,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> level of individual speakers this correlation breaks down.

Such knowledge could enable HIV programs to better respond to their needs. This qualitative study examined the experiences of adolescents living with HIV in Kitwe, Kalomo and Lusaka in Zambia. In-depth interviews were conducted with adolescents aged 10 – 19 living with HIV (n= 58) and their health care providers (n= 14). In addition, 13 focus group sessions were conducted with adolescents living with HIV (n= 53), health care providers (n= 24) and parents (n= 21). Thematic analysis was used to draw out the social–ecological determinants of adolescents' experiences. Results showed that a range of factors located at the individual, family and peer, community and structural levels determine the experiences of adolescents living with HIV. At the individual level, resilience and internalized stigma were found to shape adolescents' perception of an HIV diagnosis, and their ability to maintain a positive outlook and sustain relationships. Family and peers supported adolescents to adjust to new drug-taking routines, but these people occasionally disclosed adolescents' HIV status inappropriately. At the community level, stigma and discrimination in schools were found to negatively influence adolescents' experiences, suggesting that approaches to normalize HIV in schools are needed. The presence of non-governmental organizations provided an entry point for the provision of broad-based livelihood, nutritional and psychosocial services for adolescents living with HIV at the <b>community</b> <b>level.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> structural level, poor flexibility of clinic opening hours, staff shortages and a lack of health policies related to adolescents living with HIV presented ongoing limitations to adolescents' ability to access relevant services.

40|$|Extract] The {{concept of}} Quality of Life (QoL) is {{implicit}} in conceptualisations of tourism, especially those used to develop and guide tourism policy and planning. At the individual level {{it is assumed that}} travel offers a number of different ways to improve the QoL of the tourist, through contributions to physical health, stress release, learning and skills building. At the community level tourism development is typically presented as a tool to improve or enhance the QoL of destination residents. More recent analyses of the actual contributions that tourism makes to the QoL of destination communities have demonstrated both the complexity of the concept and suggested that tourism may not always make the assumed QoL contributions. Research to date on the links between travel and individual QoL has focussed mostly on describing the range of contributions, especially for younger travellers and specific forms of tourism such as volunteering, backpacking and educational tourism, often associated with youth tourists. This research does have, however, a number of issues including problems with survivor bias and a reliance on inferring the QoL contributions from descriptions of travel experiences. This paper seeks to contribute to improving our understanding of the linkages between QoL and tourism through an exploratory study of young people's social representations of QoL in general. By studying representations of Qol outside of the tourism context it is possible to more critically examine the role that tourism might play at both an individual and a <b>community</b> <b>level.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> individual level it allows for an analysis of how important travel is, if at all, in QoL, while at the community level it provides insights into how tourism impacts could affect younger destination residents.

40|$|Plant {{facilitation}} is {{a positive}} interaction where a nurse or nurse plant community alters the local conditions, improving the lifetime fitness of other beneficiary plants. In stressful environments, a common consequence is the formation of discrete vegetation patches under nurse plants, surrounded by open space. The consequences of such spatial patterns have been studied mostly at the <b>community</b> <b>level.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> population level, facilitation causes a distribution of beneficiary individuals that could have intraspecific genetic consequences. The spatial patchiness {{and the increase in}} local aggregation can potentially affect the population fine-scale genetic structure. In addition, marked microenvironmental differences under nurses versus outside could lead to plastic phenotypic variation between facilitated and non-facilitated individuals, as for example reproductive asynchrony, potentially producing assortative mating. This study tests the hypothesis that plant facilitation can have genetic consequences for the population of a beneficiary plant (Euphorbia nicaeensis) by affecting its spatial genetic structure and mating patterns between subpopulations of facilitated and non-facilitated individuals. Facilitation in this system creates an aggregated distribution of beneficiary individuals compared to a minority of non-facilitated individuals that grow on the open ground. Facilitation also leads to slight phenological differences mediated by strong microenvironmental differences created by nurses compared to the open ground. Yet a molecular analysis showed that, although there is fine-scale spatial genetic structure in this system, {{there is no evidence that}} it is caused by facilitation. Numerical simulations further showed that spatial genetic patterns in the population are little influenced by the phenological mismatch observed in the field. Synthesis. Facilitation leads to the strong spatial aggregation of beneficiary plants and desynchronizes their flowering phenology, but the magnitude of these effects is not enough to have local genetic consequences in our study system. Facilitation seems thus to have a homogenizing role by allowing the persistence of a diverse gene pool in populations in harsh environments, rather than promoting genetic differentiation. Further information on other systems where facilitation produces stronger spatial or phenological effects on facilitated plants is needed to fill our large knowledge gap on the genetic effects of facilitation. © 2014 British Ecological Society.

40|$|Forests play an {{important}} role in climate-change management, particularly at rural <b>community</b> <b>level.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, forests are essential resources for human welfare and {{an important}} part of the landscape. In addition to providing vital environmental services, forests provide goods that are crucial to the wellbeing of many communities living in and around them. Thus, forests are valuable resources for poor and vulnerable populations in developing countries. However, the observed and predicted impact of climate change is projected to have an extensive range of consequences, many of which represent major threats to forest-dependent communities. Consequently, an investigation of the vulnerability of forest-dependent communities to climate change has become necessary and important. Within academic and research circles on social vulnerability assessment at rural community level, the IPCC’s [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] concept of vulnerability has gained wider acceptance. The IPCC definition conceptualizes vulnerability as a product of exposure to a climatic event, the sensitivity of a system, and the system’s adaptive capacity. Thus to assess the vulnerability of a community, the factors that contribute to the three elements of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity must be identified and analysed. Operationalizing the IPCC concept in vulnerability assessment often focuses on the use of empirical models and climate-change projections to assess potential impacts. This entails measuring exposure by the degree and magnitude of climatic hazard to which a community is exposed; sensitivity is measured by the degree to which a community is affected negatively by changes in climatic conditions; and adaptive capacity is quantified and measured by using assets and capitals as indicators of the community’s ability to adapt. This concept and this approach to vulnerability assessment have been used widely to analyse communities’ vulnerability to climate change. Although such studies have contributed immensely to our understanding of the bio-physical processes and impacts of climate change at global and regional level, they are unable to capture the micro-level specificities of climate change. Moreover, regardless of how ‘climate change’ is perceived by scientists, individual perceptions of its meaning are likely to relate more to the public discourse and wider debate about the extent of its impact. This thesis addresses the need for detailed understanding of forest-based rural communities’ vulnerability to climate change. The methodological novelty of the study entailed a modification of the IPCC vulnerability framework to tease out the key factors characterizing household vulnerability to climate variability and change at forest-based rural community level in Vhembe District, South Africa. Vegetation type was used as a criterion to select Makhado, Mutale and Thulamela municipalities, which together with Musina, constitute Vhembe District. Seven rural communities in each municipality were selected. Using the stratified proportionate random sampling procedure in combination with weighted enumeration area (EA) for these communities, 366 households were chosen and interviewed. The study used local knowledge gathered through a household survey to analyse rural people’s conceptualization of climate change and its perceived impact on forest-based livelihoods in the communities. This was done by extending the IPCC concept of exposure to include local sociocultural understanding of climate change. Sensitivity was modified so that it did not focus only on households’ level of dependence on vulnerable forest resources, but examined their capacity to engage in sustainable forest use and management. This was based on the understanding that forest dependence could be a source of both vulnerability to and resilience against climate change. Adaptive capacity was extended to include examination of how people interact with social and institutional resources in their community, as well as how this enhances or constrains their adaptive capacity. The study used a four-tiered approach to assess key factors that characterized household vulnerability to climate variability and change at forest-based rural community level in South Africa. The approach started by investigating the people’s exposure to climate variability and change events. This entailed investigation of local sociocultural understandings of climate change, and how this connects with people’s use and management of forests (Chapter 3). The second stage involved a perception-based analysis approach to assess people’s perceptions of climate variability and change events and their effects on forest-based livelihood in their communities (Chapter 4). The third stage of the study involved assessment of households’ level of dependence on forest resources and the people’s capacity to engage in sustainable forest use and management as a means of reducing vulnerability to climate change (Chapter 5). The last stage of the study investigated how various intangible and dynamic processes – including human capital, information, household coping responses, institutional services, and social support services in the communities – interact to dictate the people’s adaptive capacity and vulnerability to climate change (Chapter 6). The findings of this research highlighted the local conceptualization of climate change and its influence on the people’s attitudes to forest use and management with respect to climate-change intervention initiatives. In addition, the study provided important insight on how the people perceived the risk of climate change to forest-based livelihoods in their community, and the relationship between climate change perception, and the people’s socioeconomic characteristics. The findings of the study support the notion that improving communities’ capacity to engage in sustainable forest use and management is essential to climate-change management at rural community level. The study also reveals vital information on the people’s range of coping responses, the current role of forests in coping practices, and factors influencing the people’s adaptive capacity Overall, this thesis demonstrates that, for the future, a more holistic approach to understanding rural communities’ vulnerability to climate change would entail recognition of the people’s sociocultural understanding of climate change, their concerns, and perceptions of climatechange impacts on their lives and livelihood, as well as an understanding of how the various dynamics and intangible processes at community level interact to dictate households’ adaptive capacity.

Such coordination intended to facilitate the removal of the restrictions on the free movement of units of UCITS in the internal market. For the purposes of internal regulation UCITS means an undertaking: (a) with the sole object of collective investment in transferable securities or in other liquid financial assets of capital raised from the public and which operate on the principle of risk-spreading; and (b) with units which are, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> request of holders, repurchased or redeemed, directly or indirectly, out of those undertakings’ assets. The UCITS may be constituted in accordance with contract law (as common funds managed by management companies), trust law (as unit trusts), or statute (as investment companies). Key investor information should be provided as a specific document to investors, before the subscription of the UCITS, in order to help them to reach informed investment decisions. Investment funds enjoy in Romania a new regulatory framework: the contract of common society hosted by new Civil Code and the new Emergency Ordinance regarding UCITS...|$|R

Data were collected at seven research sites across the country, and complemented by a review of available reports and articles. Their analysis reveals an insignificant nation-wide impact of HIV/AIDS in sectors of health, education, demography and economy. This is reflected in the relatively low and stable HIV prevalence rate since the mid- 1980 s, which may be attributed to the interplay of a complex set of social and behavioural factor, and a successful policy to fight against the spread of the disease. The main features of this adequate policy consist of a timely response, an eagerness to anticipate on new developments, the strategic involvement of religious and political leaders, effective STD-control programmes, and the construction of strong responses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>level.</b> Yet, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> family and individual levels a clear impact of HIV/AIDS was identified, which could often be related to the specificity of the disease. For HIV/AIDS-affected families, health care expenses constitute a heavy burden. The presence of HIV/AIDS in families entails a variety of forms of instability and thus contributes to unstable and progressively degrading living conditions for children, girls in particular.

Guimarães, NICPRI / University of Évora (Portugal) J. D. Pérez Cebada, Universidad of Huelva (Spain) Comparative and {{transnational}} analyses of social conflicts, {{related to the}} environmental changes produced by modern and contemporary mining industries, have been a topic of growing academic interest {{for the last two}} decades. Those conflicts were often presented in different contexts as anti-modern peasant protests, indigenous resistance, or conflicts of interest and as a cause for social disruption. In the Iberian Peninsula, the more important mining basins were affected by the three classical types of pollution (atmospheric, water and soil pollution). Pollution also triggered persistent conflicts between mining companies and diverse social groups: rural communities, mining workers, scientists, sanitary professionals, and especially farmers and landowners. The former groups sometimes combined their forces, whereas the latter fought on their own. This panel has gathered recent contributions on the environmental changes produced by the development of the mining industry in the Iberian Peninsula during the last two centuries and how it related with conflict and social change <b>at</b> <b>community</b> <b>level</b> and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> national {{and transnational}} levels...|$|R

It represents an interesting subject in the literature of development economics for two reasons. First, <b>the</b> policy started <b>at</b> a very early stage of industrialization. Second, the policy has been carried out often voluntarily <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>level</b> rather than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> state <b>level.</b> This paper examines the origin and rationales of such a policy and finds that the policy cannot be understood unless we look into a special institutional arrangement: China's unique communal duality. Study of the subject contributes significantly to an understanding of development economics. " ("JEL" P 5, Q 0, O 2) Copyright 1999 Western Economic Association International. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{creative}} project examines {{trends in}} school {{planning and design}} <b>at</b> both <b>the</b> <b>community</b> and site <b>levels.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>level,</b> two trends have shaped many of the decisions made in school planning: consolidating schools into mega-sized schools and placing schools {{on the periphery of}} development. These practices contribute to sprawl, urban disinvestment, racial and social segregation, environmental degradation and educational inequality. Alternatives in school planning such as school renovation and schools as community centers, are examined through case studies. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> site <b>level,</b> schools are typically built on acres of land covered by lawn, sports fields and asphalt parking. Research shows that school grounds can serve as valuable educational resources when designed as learning landscapes. A conceptual master plan for Storer Elementary School in Muncie, Indiana illustrates how a bland school landscape can be transformed into an educational resource to improve learning, environmental quality, safety and health.

40|$|ObjectiveTo provide {{descriptive}} data on ambulatory ability and muscle strength {{in a large}} cohort of individuals with spina bifida enrolled in a National Spina Bifida Patient Registry (NSBPR) and to investigate factors associated with ambulatory status. DesignCross-sectional analysis of data from a multi-site patient registryResultsDescriptive analysis of mobility variables for 2604 individuals with spina bifida age 5 and above are presented from 19 sites in the United States. Analysis of a subset of NSBPR data from 380 individuals from three sites accompanied by data from a specialized spina bifida electronic medical record revealed that those with no history of a shunt, lower motor level, and no history of hip or knee contracture release surgery {{were more likely to}} be ambulatory <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>level</b> than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> household or wheelchair level. ConclusionThis study is the first to examine factors associated with ambulatory status in a large sample of individuals with myelomeningocele and non-myelomeningocele subtypes of SB. Results of this study delineate the breadth of strength and functional abilities within the different age groups and subtypes of SB. The results may inform clinicians of the characteristics of those with varying ambulatory abilities.

40|$|Comprehensive {{information}} on geographic patterns of leaf morphological traits in Chinese forests is still scarce. To explore the spatial patterns of leaf traits, we investigated leaf area (LA), leaf thickness (LT), specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf {{dry matter content}} (LDMC) across 847 species from nine typical forests along the North-South Transect of Eastern China (NSTEC) between July and August 2013, and also calculated the community weighted means (CWM) of leaf traits by determining the relative dominance of each species. Our results showed that, for all species, the means (SE) of LA, LT, SLA, and LDMC were 2860. 01 +/- 135. 37 mm(2), 0. 17 +/- 0. 003 mm, 20. 15 +/- 0. 43 m(2) kg(- 1),. and 316. 73 +/- 3. 81 mg g(- 1), respectively. Furthermore, latitudinal variation in leaf traits differed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> species and <b>community</b> <b>levels.</b> Generally, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> species <b>level,</b> SLA increased and LDMC decreased as latitude increased, whereas no clear latitudinal trends among LA or LT were found, which could {{be the result of}} shifts in plant functional types. When scaling up to the <b>community</b> <b>level,</b> more significant spatial patterns of leaf traits were observed (R- 2 = 0. 46 - 0. 71), driven by climate and soil N content. These results provided synthetic data compilation and analyses to better parameterize complex ecological models in the future, and emphasized the importance of scaling-up when studying the biogeographic patterns of plant traits...|$|R

It argues {{that after the}} initial year the war became an ‘occasional war’ {{in that it was}} assumed that the empire would triumph. But it also laid the foundations for reactions to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. This is the first exploration of the place of the Boer War in Australian history <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>level.</b> Indeed, even <b>at</b> <b>the</b> national <b>level</b> the literature is limited. It is often forgotten that, despite the claims that Australia became a federation via peaceful means, the colonies and the new nation were, in fact, at war. This study aims to bring back into focus a forgotten part of Australian and imperial history, and argues that the Australian experience of the Boer War was more than the execution of Morant and Hancock...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the role of {{sponsorship}} and patronage in the process of migration and in the formation of Biraderi based relationships and various sociological questions posed in the local context within which ethnicity is a defining element. For example, it demonstrates how far Rochdale Pakistanis as an ethnic group are maintaining their culture in Britain; in particular, how kinship and friendship networks determine the dominant pattern of social interaction among Pakistanis. Further, it {{deals with the}} extent to which these networks help and facilitate the immigration and settlement of Pakistanis in this country and result in their "incapsulation" within the wider society. The analysis of these issues was. conducted at different levels: <b>at</b> <b>the</b> individual (case studies) and interactional <b>level,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> social situations and <b>community</b> <b>level</b> and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of the wider society's institutions and structures. This included a consideration of the activities of the local Pakistani community in terms of their kinship networks, their economic"activites political participation, religious institutions, community leadership and ethnic organisations. It also includes an analysis of the actors in these different fields, highlighting each area of activity that led to the incapsulation of Pakistanis. It was found that the Pakistani community tends to be mobilized on ethnic lines. This mobilization, it seems, reinforces their ethnic identity and results in their unity, especially when threatened by hostile "out-groups". I The analysis strongly suggests that the whole complex of ethnic institutions manifests the Pakistani community's wish to express and, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time, perpetuate their traditional values, beliefs and culture, although this varies to some extent according to occupational background, educational level and generational differences...|$|R
40|$|Food webs {{are complex}} systems in which organisms {{interact}} {{with each other and with}} the abiotic aspects of their environment, thus acting as the conduit for transfers of energy and nutrients through ecosystems. Classical approaches to food webs focus strongly on patterns and processes occurring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>level</b> rather than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> broader ecosystem scale. Recent developments in community ecology suggest that spatial processes may be important in affecting food web dynamics and affect ecosystems as well, thus leading to the idea of meta-ecosystems. Here, we make a synthesis on how the links between food web dynamics and spatial ecosystem dynamics may be studied through (i) identifying differences between metacommunity and landscape ecology approaches when dealing with food webs, (ii) arguing that a tighter synthesis of the two approaches is needed for a good understanding of how diversity, ecosystem process and trait distributions in landscapes are related, and (iii) laying out how this gap can be efficiently bridged under the framework of meta-ecosystems. |$|R
