30|$|In addition, as {{put forward}} by first {{reactions}} to the legal appraisal, when preparing the application for authorisation, EEA based producers of articles can use the structured system of downstream and upstream information and communication <b>concerning</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substance</b> risks, established by Title IV REACH (‘Information in the Supply Chain’) [23]. In most third countries national chemicals legislation does not provide comparable information and communication tools {{that can be used}} by article producers applying for REACH authorisation. One could argue that this constellation might detrimentally affect the competitive opportunities of foreign producers. The latter are, however, free to join forces and cooperate with their foreign suppliers or other importers based on a model such as REACH. To put such a system into effect, they have to spend resources. They might, however, allocate the resources which they have saved in the first place for not being obliged under the REACH downstream and upstream information and communication system. With a view to the upcoming application for authorisation foreign producers have the opportunity to focus their expenditures on the specific relevant requirements. The domestic producers, on the other hand, are obliged to co-finance the entire REACH system (e.g. registration fees are the core funding of ECHA). Hence one could argue that foreign producers are even advantaged. In sum, there is no detrimental impact and therefore no less favourable treatment in terms of Art. 2.1 TBT.|$|R
40|$|A {{cytogenetic}} monitoring {{study was}} carried out {{on a group of}} workers in clinical analysis laboratories to investigate the risk of occupational exposure to chronic low levels of chemicals. Thirty-four clinical laboratories {{have been involved in the}} study. In these laboratories, toxicants and analytical procedures utilized have been characterized. The individual occupational exposure of workers was assessed by use of a questionnaire <b>concerning</b> the <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> utilized. About 300 different chemicals have been identified. Cytogenetic analyses (chromosomal aberration and micronucleus tests) were carried out on a strictly selected group of 50 workers enrolled from these laboratories and compared to 53 controls (healthy blood donors) matched for gender and age. The exposed group shows a significantly higher frequency of genetic damage than the control group. Both chromatid and chromosome aberration frequencies in workers appear significantly higher than in controls. Similarly, comparison between micronucleated cells rates of exposed and unexposed groups show significantly higher frequencies of binucleated cells with micronucleus (BNMN) and of total micronuclei (MN tot) in workers than in controls...|$|R

The FOCA also issues permits for hazardous shipments by air, this <b>concerns</b> mainly <b>chemical</b> hazardous <b>substances</b> such as ammunition, as well as biological or radioactive cargo. These authorizations are communicated to the Swiss Air Force which then monitors the corresponding flight in Swiss airspace with the FLORAKO air surveillance system. FOCA is also the contact point for the embassies of other nations, if they want to use Swiss airspace with a State aircraft. The Air Force modified all-diplomatic clearance requests that are filed outside the opening times of the FOCA.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{treats the}} {{situation}} {{connected with the}} possible leakage of ammonia, applied in the Eggenberg a. s. brewery as cooling medium. It deals with the so-called worst variant of the accident { [...] } leakage of the maximum possible amount of the substance. The introduction {{is devoted to the}} legislation <b>concerning</b> the dangerous <b>chemical</b> <b>substance,</b> prevention of serious accidents, components of the integrated rescue system and the fire prevention. The thesis contains the characteristics and the description of ammonia as dangerous substance, with focus on its toxicity and it analyses the results of a possible leakage. For the simulation of a possible accident, the software instrument TerEx was applied. The calculations acquired after entering the input data into the program served for determination of the zone where the detrimental concentration of ammonia would reach in case of a leakage. In comparison with the original calculations performed in the last years applying the ROZEX programme, the zone with a harmful concentration would be substantially extended. The results of the thesis should be taken into consideration in the emergency plan of the region and in the emergency plan of the Eggenberg a. s., Brewery, however, also the procedure of the intervention of the integrated rescue system components shall be specified. Moreover the way of performing the inspections in the section of the fire protection in subjects applying, processing or storing dangerous <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> and preparations is drafted. The thesis tries to draw the {{attention to the fact that}} also a relatively small amount of a dangerous <b>chemical</b> <b>substance</b> may cause a considerably significant accident...|$|R

5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily <b>concerned</b> with the <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|R

Nevertheless, the use of <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> derived from fossil resources and toxic <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> was needed to obtain good bondability [9 – 12] with such natural adhesives.
