In this region the plasma will not be perturbed, and any mass motions will die out. If this is not the case, however, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a convection zone.

These inherent design conflicts are one of many factors that limit the efficiency of practical Stirling engines. A typical design is a stack of fine metal wire meshes, with low porosity to reduce dead space, and with the wire axes perpendicular to the gas flow to reduce conduction in that direction and to maximize <b>convective</b> <b>heat</b> transfer.|$|E

For a satellite in space, a 100°C (373 Kelvin) surface facing the sun will absorb a lot of radiant heat, because the sun's surface temperature is nearly 6000 Kelvin, whereas the same surface facing deep-space will radiate a lot of heat, since deep-space has an effective temperature {{of only a few}} Kelvin.|$|E

However, it is {{possible}} that energy savings using <b>convective</b> <b>heating</b> can be further improved using heat pumps that service both occupied and unoccupied spaces. Moreover, <b>convective</b> <b>heating</b> increases vertical temperature gradients in a room; thus, it is hard to say whether occupants are being provided with sufficient thermal comfort. The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the thermal comfort provided by both radiant and <b>convective</b> <b>heating</b> systems. In this study, a small office room was modeled, and then temperature and airflow distributions in the room were calculated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations using ESP-r (Environmental research simulation software). Furthermore, distributions of Standard Effective Temperatures (SET*) were calculated using the air temperature distributions obtained from the CFD simulations, which allows us to compare the thermal comfort provided by <b>convective</b> <b>heating</b> with that provided by radiant heating. The results show that radiant heating can provide satisfactory thermal comfort, even when the room air temperature is low. However, thermal comfort also depends on the temperature of blowing air, and blowing air must reach occupied regions; thus, only radiant heating cannot circulate sufficient air. In contrast, <b>convective</b> <b>heating</b> increases vertical temperature gradients in a room. Therefore, rather than using only radiant or <b>convective</b> <b>heating,</b> it may be more effective to combine them efficiently. ...|$|R

The trough is parabolic along one axis and linear in the orthogonal axis. For change of the daily position of the sun perpendicular to the receiver, the trough tilts east to west so that the direct radiation remains focused on the receiver. However, seasonal changes in the angle of sunlight parallel to the trough does not require adjustment of the mirrors, since the light is simply concentrated elsewhere on the receiver.

25|$|Central to {{the success}} of this is the ability of the human body, unlike that of the animals they hunt, to {{effectively}} remove muscle heat waste. In most animals, this is stored by allowing a temporary increase in body temperature. This allows them to escape from animals that quickly speed after them for a short duration (the way nearly all predators catch their prey). Humans, unlike other animals that catch prey, remove heat with a specialized thermoregulation based on sweat evaporation. One gram of sweat can remove 2,598 J of heat energy. Another mechanism is increased skin blood flow during exercise that allows for greater <b>convective</b> <b>heat</b> loss that is aided by our upright posture. This skin based cooling has resulted in humans acquiring an increased number of sweat glands, combined with a lack of body fur that would otherwise stop air circulation and efficient evaporation. Because humans can remove exercise heat, they can avoid the fatigue from heat exhaustion that affects animals chased in a persistent manner, and so eventually catch them.|$|E
25|$|In {{most high}} power Stirling engines, both the minimum {{pressure}} and mean {{pressure of the}} working fluid are above atmospheric pressure. This initial engine pressurization can be realized by a pump, or by filling the engine from a compressed gas tank, or even just by sealing the engine when the mean temperature {{is lower than the}} mean operating temperature. All of these methods increase the mass of working fluid in the thermodynamic cycle. All of the heat exchangers must be sized appropriately to supply the necessary heat transfer rates. If the heat exchangers are well designed and can supply the heat flux needed for <b>convective</b> <b>heat</b> transfer, then the engine, in a first approximation, produces power in proportion to the mean pressure, as predicted by the West number, and Beale number. In practice, the maximum pressure is also limited to the safe pressure of the pressure vessel. Like most aspects of Stirling engine design, optimization is multivariate, and often has conflicting requirements. A difficulty of pressurization is that while it improves the power, the heat required increases proportionately to the increased power. This heat transfer is made increasingly difficult with pressurization since increased pressure also demands increased thicknesses of the walls of the engine, which, in turn, increase the resistance to heat transfer.|$|E

Therefore, when <b>convective</b> <b>heating</b> excites Rossby wave lows to its west and Kelvin wave low to its east, the Kelvin and Rossby waves would produce a unified BL moisture convergence field that leads (to the east of) the major <b>convective</b> <b>heating</b> (see Fig.  3 e).
