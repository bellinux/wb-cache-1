25|$|Seam bowlers <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of {{help from}} certain types of pitches. Hard pitches that have a cracked or ridged surface are best for seam bowling since the {{hardness}} {{makes it easier to}} bounce the ball without losing speed while the uneven surface adds to the unpredictability of the bounce when the ball hits the pitch. This is known as variable bounce. On rare occasions, an extremely hard and uneven pitch is declared too dangerous to play on, since the batsman cannot predict the ball, and are likely to be hit as a result. Green pitches can also assist the seam bowler since the tiny tufts of grass represent an uneven surface although this is a mixed blessing since the green surface also slows the ball slightly. It is difficult for a seam bowler to be effective on a very flat and even-surfaced pitch (known as a flat track in cricket vernacular) and seamers usually resort to aggressive bowling tactics and/or bowling cutters on such surfaces.|$|E

500|$|Despite Ice-T's {{attempts}} to differentiate Body Count {{from his work}} in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as rap to provoke negative criticism. [...] "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word rap they <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people who think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. You say the word rock, people say, 'Oh, but I like Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac — that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song." [...] Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that [...] "A lot of rappers {{want to be in a}} rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work.

Leading his team in scoring (19.0) and rebounding (10.5), he chalked up 39 double doubles, which was third best in the conference and eighth best in the league. Indiana recorded 42 wins and qualified for the playoffs once again as the eighth seed, where they faced one of the hottest teams in the league at that time, the New Jersey Nets. The Pacers lost the series in 5 Games, despite forcing overtime twice. The Nets decided to put Kenyon Martin on O'Neal after the latter put up a 30-point, 11 rebound performance in Game 1, and they succeeded by limiting him to just 17.2 points and 7.6 rebounds per game for the rest of the series. As the Pacers reflected on yet another premature end to the postseason, they knew that O'Neal was next in line to succeed the 36-year-old Miller as the new face of the franchise. At the same time, the Pacers seemed to have found players in Brad Miller, Ron Artest, Al Harrington and Jamaal Tinsley who complemented O'Neal. Indiana was on the brink of becoming a legitimate threat in the East.|$|R
30|$|Complexity {{is another}} {{significant}} aspect that can reveal a learner’s writing competence, {{thus it is}} also measured in case that some learners are reluctant to try to produce more complex words or sentences for fear of making errors. The results reveal that the group adopting a DDL approach didn’t make obvious improvement in both of the vocabulary complexity and grammatical complexity. Furthermore, according to some interviewees, Baidu seems to help them better in improving writing complexity since students <b>can</b> usually <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of relevant complex sentences or even excellent essays just by simply typing in {{the topic of the}} essay in Baidu in the process of revising essays. However, they often have to do complex query in BNCweb for getting the desirable sentences. In reality, many students just use the simple query function by simply typing in some phrases, but rarely use POS tags offered to them while consulting corpora. This is consistent with Pérez-Paredes et al.’s (2012) discovery that learners just used BNC as if they were using Google without using POS tags or regular expressions. Therefore, the lack of corpus consultation skills is an important factor that may influence learners’ improvement in complexity. Just as stated by Sabti and Chaichan’s (2014) that computer skill is the biggest barrier that impedes the use of computer technologies in language learning. Thus more training or instruction about consultation skills should be provided to students. With good consultation skills, students will exploit corpora better thus they may easily get the complex sentence structure that they want from BNCweb while revising sentences. Then in the writing test {{they may be able to}} produce complex sentences. In addition, it usually takes a rather long time for one to significantly improve one’s productive use of vocabulary and grammatical knowledge. Thus it is suggested that teachers continue the DDL activities in writing for a longer time period, and then evaluate their writing complexity again. Moreover, EFL learners should be encouraged to take risks to produce more complex words or structures and not to be afraid of making errors in regular writing assignments. In the process of dealing with complex expressions or structures, their language proficiency will be improved, which may result in their better performance in complexity in writing test.|$|R
