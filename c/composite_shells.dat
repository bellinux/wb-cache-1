The rudder is constructed of two molded <b>composite</b> <b>shells</b> which are bonded together and injected with two-part foam for added strength. The rudder post is all stainless steel {{with a flat}} stainless steel plate reinforcing weldment positioned within the rudder. The rudder post passes through the hull with a water-tight, close tolerance fit between the shaft and the nylon bearing. The rudder post is brought up through the cockpit sole, with the steering quadrant mounted on top. The pedestal system is cable-linked with the radial driver being connected to the rudder post by a keyway and lock nuts. Access to the system is achieved via the removable fiberglass cover located in the cockpit sole. This design provides excellent support for the rudder stock. The rudder may be removed by loosening the bolt, rollers and quadrant. The rudder must be supported from below during this procedure.|$|E

40|$|<b>Composite</b> <b>shell</b> linings, {{consisting}} of a layer of permanent sprayed concrete to form a primary lining, a layer of spray applied waterproofing membrane and a further layer of sprayed or cast secondary concrete lining, represent the latest development in the tunnelling industry. While demand for the <b>composite</b> <b>shell</b> method is increasing, {{there are still some}} unknowns associated with it. One of the biggest areas of uncertainty for the <b>composite</b> <b>shell</b> method is the extent of composite action in the interfaces between the sprayed waterproofing membrane and the primary and the secondary linings. A research programme is in progress at the University of Southampton, UK, to investigate the behaviour of <b>composite</b> <b>shell</b> SCL tunnels. As part of the testing programme, a series of short-term direct tension and direct shear tests have been carried out on samples cut from panels built up from a sprayed primary layer, spray applied waterproofing membrane and sprayed secondary layer.

The first <b>composite</b> <b>shells</b> were made from a form of papier-mâché and became popular in the 1870s. These paper shells were sold world-wide by the Waters Paper Boat Factory of Troy, New York. Modern shells are usually made of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic in a honeycomb structure. They are manufactured by either cold laying up of the carbon, which is then left to set, or by using heat curing, which ensures that the carbon fibre composite is properly set.

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, Bernard Cohen argued that biomineralized skeletons arose for [...] "engineering" [...] reasons {{rather than as}} defenses. There are many other {{defensive}} strategies available to prey animals including mobility and acute senses, chemical defenses, and concealment. Mineral-organic composites are both stronger and cheaper to build than all-organic skeletons, and these two advantages {{would have made it}} possible for animals to grow larger and, in some cases, more muscular — in animals beyond a certain size, the larger muscles and their greater leverage produce forces all-organic skeletons are not rigid enough to withstand. The development of modern brachiopods includes a progression from all-organic to mineral-organic <b>composite</b> <b>shells,</b> which may be a clue to their evolutionary development. The evolution of rigid biomineralized exoskeletons may then have started an arms race in which predators developed drills or chemical weapons capable of penetrating shells, some prey animals developed heavier, tougher shells, etc.|$|E
