40|$|AbstractIn {{automation}} domain, the conformance {{of field}} bus devices {{in regard to}} the corresponding bus system standard is ensured by deploying <b>conformance</b> <b>tests.</b> The correctness of the tests is therefore decisive. A common practice to develop <b>conformance</b> <b>test</b> manually is fault-prone {{due to the fact that}} the test engineer can misinterpret the standard or the standard itself has defects. Therefore, in this present work we argue that a <b>conformance</b> <b>test</b> development should be based on formally verified requirements and propose an approach to automatically generate <b>conformance</b> <b>tests</b> based on the verified model of a bus system standard in order to assure the test correctness...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure the {{operation}} of open communication systems with at least possible errors suitable precautions have to be taken, the adherence to which is imperative for all manufacturers of components for such systems. Part {{of this is the}} <b>conformance</b> <b>test,</b> which is a test for the compliance of the respective protocol implementation with the corresponding protocol standard. Within the framework of the collaborative project "Fieldbus" sponsored by the BMFT, as well as within a follow-up collaborative BMFT project for the provision of the infrastructure for <b>conformance</b> and interoperability <b>tests,</b> new <b>conformance</b> <b>test</b> systems are being developed for the protocol standard "PROFIBUS". The Fraunhofer Institute of Information and Data Processing (IITB) is the project leader for this development and also has an essential share in it. With the customer-friendly <b>conformance</b> <b>test</b> systems for the protocol layers 2 and 7 the IITB offers permanent testing services to all manufacturers of PROFIBUS components as a customer service. Using the example of the <b>conformance</b> <b>test</b> of the protocol layer 2 the structure and operation of the PROFIBUS test systems as well as structure and execution of test cases are introduced in more detail.
