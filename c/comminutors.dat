40|$|AbstractRoasted peanuts of China and India origin were {{ground in}} a {{commercial}} ultra-high speed grinder operated at 20, 000 rpm for 2. 0 – 5. 0 min for natural peanut butter production. Grinding characteristics of both peanuts were evaluated in terms of specific energy consumption, Esc with respect to its grinding time and mean particle size. The Esc increased with grinding time with China peanuts having higher Esc than India peanuts. The specific energy consumption modeled to the size reduction ratio of China and India peanuts was predicted more accurately using a linear and exponential model respectively compared to the classical models by Bond, Rittinger and Kick. From the comparison of Bond’s working index, Wi, the ultra-high speed grinder {{is said to be}} more energy efficient than other <b>comminutors</b> in terms of its capability to produce finer particle size in shorter time than the rest...|$|E
40|$|Wastewater {{contains}} large solids {{and grit}} that {{can interfere with}} treatment processes or cause undue mechanical wear and increased maintenance on wastewater treatment equipment. To minimize potential problems, these materials require separate handling. Preliminary treatment removes these constituents from the influent wastewater. Preliminary treatment consists of screening, grit removal, septage handling, odor control, and flow equalization. This fact sheet discusses screening and grit removal. Screening Screening is the first unit operation used at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Screening removes objects such as rags, paper, plastics, and metals to prevent damage and clogging of downstream equipment, piping, and appurtenances. Some modern wastewater treatment plants use both coarse screens and fine screens. Figure 1 depicts a typical bar screen (a type of coarse screen). Coarse Screens Coarse screens remove large solids, rags, and debris from wastewater, and typically have openings of 6 mm (0. 25 in) or larger. Types of coarse screens include mechanically and manually cleaned bar screens, including trash racks. Table 1 describes {{the various types of}} coarse screens. Fine Screens Fine screens are typically used to remove material that may create operation and maintenance problems in downstream processes, particularly in systems that lack primary treatment. Typical opening sizes for fine screens are 1. 5 to 6 mm (0. 06 to 0. 25 in). Very fine screens with openings of 0. 2 to 1. 5 mm (0. 01 to 0. 06 in) placed after coarse or fine screens can reduce suspended solids to levels near those achieved by primary clarification. <b>Comminutors</b> and Grinders Processing coarse solids reduces their size so they can be removed during downstream treatment operations, such as primary clarification, where both floating and settleable solids are removed. Comminuting and grinding devices are installed in the wastewater flow channel to grind and shred material up to 6 to 19 mm (0. 25 to 0. 75 in) in size. <b>Comminutors</b> consist of a rotating slotted cylinder through which wastewater flow passes. Solids that are too large to pass through the slots are cut by blades as the cylinder rotates, reducing their size until they pass through the slot openings...|$|E
40|$|Requirements Order R 5 - 2007 - 0113, {{prescribing}} {{waste discharge}} {{requirements for the}} White Slough Water Pollution Control Facility, San Joaquin County. For {{the purposes of this}} Order, the City of Lodi is hereafter referred to as “Discharger ” and the White Slough Water Pollution Control Facility is hereafter referred to as “Facility. ” 2. The Discharger owns and operates two separate wastewater collection systems, a municipal wastewater line and an industrial wastewater line that collects primarily food processing wastewater from Pacific Coast Producers, a local cannery. The Facility’s wastewater treatment system consists of a head works with <b>comminutors,</b> mechanical grit removal, primary sedimentation, conventional activated sludge with nitrification and denitrification, secondary sedimentation, tertiary treatment using cloth media filtration, and ultraviolet light pathogen deactivation (UV Disinfection). 3. Order R 5 - 2007 - 0113 (NPDES No. CA 0079243), allows year-round discharges of tertiary treated, UV disinfected municipal wastewater to Dredger Cut, a water of the United States and part of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. However in general, the Facility only discharges to surface water during the months of September through June. Typically during the summer months (mid-April through early-September), undisinfected secondary treated municipal wastewater is pumped to the Facility’s 40 -acres of unlined storage ponds and is used to irrigate the Discharger’s agricultural fields. The Discharger’s agricultural fields cover approximately 790 acres adjacent to the Facility and are used for fodder, fiber, or feed crops that are not directly used for human consumption (hereinafter The Agricultural Fields). Throughout the year...|$|E
40|$|Titanium alloys are {{becoming}} attractive as structural 13; materials {{because of their}} high strength and low density. This report discusses a method of producing dispersion hardened titanium alloys through powder metallurgical techniques. An electron beam splatting furnace designed and built at NAL for producing titanium flakes and also a <b>comminutor</b> for mechanically alloying the flakes are described. Typical results on titaniumyttria and titanium- ceria are presented to show the efficacy of dispersion hardening. It is suggested that in general high temperature creep of dispersion hardened materials depends only on dispersion parameters {{and not on the}} associated substructure...|$|R
50|$|Barwon Water's Black Rock sewage {{treatment}} plant is located to the north east of Breamlea, handing effluent from Geelong and surrounding suburbs. Black Rock was first chosen as the ocean outfall for Geelong's sewage in 1912, with the outfall sewer being built during the next three years. Initially the sewage was left untreated before being discharged into the ocean, polluting several beaches downstream on the prevailing ocean currents. A basic <b>comminutor</b> was installed at the outlet in the 1970s, and in the 1980s the current treatment plant was built with an upgraded filtration system, along with a 1.2 kilometre long ocean outfall. 1997 saw an upgrade to the plant, with secondary filtration introduced, and a pipeline installed to allow recycled water to be used on a flower farm at Torquay.|$|R
