25|$|A {{diverging}} lens (one that is thicker {{at the edges}} than the middle) or a convex mirror forms a virtual image. Such an image is so reduced in size {{when compared to the}} original object. A <b>converging</b> <b>lens</b> (one that is thicker in the middle than at the edges) or a concave mirror is also capable of producing a virtual image if the object is within the focal length. Such an image will be magnified. In contrast, an object placed in front of a <b>converging</b> <b>lens</b> or concave mirror at a position beyond the focal length produces a real image. Such an image may be magnified or reduced depending on the position of the object.|$|E
25|$|If {{the lens}} is {{biconvex}} or plano-convex, a collimated {{beam of light}} passing through the lens converges to a spot (a focus) behind the lens. In this case, the lens is called a positive or <b>converging</b> <b>lens.</b> The distance from the lens to the spot is the focal length of the lens, which is commonly abbreviated f in diagrams and equations.|$|E
25|$|Incoming {{parallel}} {{rays are}} focused by a <b>converging</b> <b>lens</b> onto a spot one focal length from the lens, {{on the far}} side of the lens. This is called the rear focal point of the lens. Rays from an object at finite distance are focused further from the lens than the focal distance; the closer the object is to the lens, the further the image is from the lens.|$|E

50|$|<b>Converging</b> <b>lenses</b> have {{positive}} optical power, while diverging lenses have negative power. When a lens is {{immersed in a}} refractive medium, its optical power and focal length change.|$|R
5000|$|The lens {{is made up}} of 16 {{panels of}} <b>converging</b> <b>lenses.</b> The light {{character}} is [...] "Fl, 7.5s", i.e. a single flashing light with an intervall of 7.5 seconds. A 230V/250V halogen metal vapour lamp is used as lantern.|$|R
25|$|A device which {{produces}} converging or diverging light rays due to refraction {{is known as}} a lens. Lenses are characterized by their focal length: a <b>converging</b> <b>lens</b> has positive focal length, while a diverging lens has negative focal length. Smaller focal length indicates that the lens has a stronger converging or diverging effect. The focal length of a simple lens in air is given by the lensmaker's equation.|$|E
25|$|The optical {{power of}} {{corrective}} lenses {{is measured in}} diopters, a value equal to the reciprocal of the focal length measured in metres; with a positive focal length corresponding to a <b>converging</b> <b>lens</b> and a negative focal length corresponding to a diverging lens. For lenses that correct for astigmatism as well, three numbers are given: one for the spherical power, one for the cylindrical power, {{and one for the}} angle of orientation of the astigmatism.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} {{conditions}} can be corrected using corrective lenses. For presbyopia and hyperopia, a <b>converging</b> <b>lens</b> provides the extra curvature necessary to bring the near point closer to the eye while for myopia a diverging lens provides the curvature necessary to send the far point to infinity. Astigmatism is corrected with a cylindrical surface lens that curves more strongly in one direction than in another, compensating for the non-uniformity of the cornea.|$|E
25|$|The {{focal length}} f is {{positive}} for <b>converging</b> <b>lenses,</b> and negative for diverging lenses. The reciprocal of the focal length, 1/f, is the optical {{power of the}} lens. If the focal length is in metres, this gives the optical power in dioptres (inverse metres).|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a three hour inquiry activity involving <b>converging</b> <b>lenses</b> and telescopes {{as part of}} a semester-long astronomy lab course for non-science majors at Hartnell Community College in Salinas, CA. Students were shown several short demonstrations and given the chance to experiment with the materials, after which there was a class discussion about the phenomena they observed. Students worked in groups of 2 - 4 to design their own experiments to address a particular question of interest to them and then presented their findings to the class. An instructor-led presentation highlighted the students' discoveries and the lab's content goals, followed by a short worksheet-based activity that guided them in applying their new knowledge to build a simple telescope using two <b>converging</b> <b>lenses.</b> The activity was successful in emphasizing communication skills and giving students opportunities to engage in the process of science in different ways. One of the biggest challenges in designing this activity was covering all of the content given the short amount of time available. Future implementations may have more success by splitting the lab into two sessions, one focusing on <b>converging</b> <b>lenses</b> and the other focusing on telescopes.

5000|$|Real {{images can}} be {{produced}} by concave mirrors and <b>converging</b> <b>lenses,</b> only if the object is placed further away from the mirror/lens than the focal point and this real image is inverted. As the object approaches the focal point the image approaches infinity, and when the object passes the focal point the image becomes virtual and is not inverted.|$|R
25|$|If {{the lens}} is biconcave or plano-concave, a {{collimated}} {{beam of light}} passing through the lens is diverged (spread); the lens is thus called a negative or diverging lens. The beam, after passing through the lens, appears to emanate from a particular point on the axis {{in front of the}} lens. The distance from this point to the lens is also known as the focal length, though it is negative with respect to the focal length of a <b>converging</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{a positive}} or <b>converging</b> <b>lens</b> in air focuses a collimated beam travelling along the lens axis {{to a spot}} (known as the focal point) at a distance f from the lens. Conversely, a point source of light placed at the focal point is converted into a collimated beam by the lens. These two cases are examples of image formation in lenses. In the former case, an object at an infinite distance (as represented by a collimated beam of waves) is focused to an image at {{the focal point of}} the lens. In the latter, an object at the focal length distance from the lens is imaged at infinity. The plane perpendicular to the lens axis situated at a distance f from the lens is called the focal plane.|$|E

The effects of changements in the slit lamp itself (slit beam and apertures) and its examination equipment (<b>converging</b> <b>lenses</b> from + 40 to + 90 D) on quality and spectrum of fundus images are demonstrated. Imaging software is applied for reconstruction of larger fundus areas in a mosaic pattern (Hugin®) and {{to perform the}} flicker test in order to visualize changes in the same fundus area at different points of time (Power Point®).|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} {{theoretical}} formulation for the nonlinear Kerr-induced focal shift of <b>converging</b> <b>lenses</b> {{in a high}} intensity regime. A numerical relation expressing the on-axis intensity of a focused Gaussian beam is derived {{in the case of}} a nonlinearly absorbing and diffracting lens induced in a medium. The concept of an effective Fresnel number is used to provide a simple linear relationship between the focal displacement and the nonlinear phase distortions. The influence of nonlinear absorption on the sensitivity of the focal shift measurements is also discussed...|$|R
50|$|In {{this simple}} {{optically}} compensated zoom lens, the afocal system {{consists of two}} positive (<b>converging)</b> <b>lenses</b> of equal focal length (lenses L1 and L3) with a negative (diverging) lens (L2) between them, with an absolute focal length {{less than half that}} of the positive lenses. Lens L3 is fixed, but lenses L1 and L2 can be moved axially in a particular non-linear relationship. This movement is usually performed by a complex arrangement of gears and cams in the lens housing, although some modern zoom lenses use computer-controlled servos to perform this positioning.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to incredulity {{on the part}} of art historians and critics of modern art, some of the harshest criticism of the Hockney-Falco thesis came from another expert in optics, image processing and pattern recognition, David G. Stork. Stork analyzed the images used by Falco and Hockney, and {{came to the conclusion that}} they do not demonstrate the kinds of optical distortion that curved mirrors or <b>converging</b> <b>lenses</b> would cause. Falco has claimed that Stork's published criticisms have relied on fabricated data and misrepresentations of Hockney and Falco's theory. Stork has rebutted this claim.|$|R
50|$|The optics of {{the current}} {{lighthouse}} were modernised in 1963.

These lenses have a focus of 250 mm and are lit by a 2,000 Watts xenon arc lamp. With a light intensity of 35 million candela Heligoland is the strongest light along the German North Sea coast. Since 1982 the smaller lighthouse on Düne Island, off the main island of Heligoland, is remotely operated from Heligoland lighthouse.|$|R

Polydimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) master structures {{are used for}} the replication of thin glass membranes, which, by an appropriate annealing procedure, result in <b>converging</b> <b>lenses</b> with positive meniscus. Hereby, we exploit PDMS - sol gel surface interactions and thickness dependent changes in composition of the sol gel solution. The lenses are realized on a circular and square like basis.

50|$|However, if {{the zone}} plate is {{constructed}} {{so that the}} opacity varies in a gradual, sinusoidal manner, the resulting diffraction causes only a single focal point to be formed.

50|$|One special {{application}} {{is to determine}} the focal length of a diverging lens: A light source is placed at twice the focal length of a <b>converging</b> <b>lens</b> {{on one side and a}} screen at the same distance on the other side so that the image of the light source is the sharpest possible. When this is achieved, the screen is replaced with a mirror and the diverging lens is inserted between the <b>converging</b> <b>lens</b> and the light source at such a distance to the mirror that the light returning through the diverging and converging lenses produces a sharp image on top of the luminous object. This is the case when the beam hitting the mirror is collimated. The distance found is the (negative) focal length of the diverging lens.|$|E

The effect of their optical combination can thus be easily studied; any errors of adjustment can be rectified, and the composite may be photographed at once.|$|R

Extraordinary imaging equations and properties that are different from those of all the existing optical lenses are also presented.
