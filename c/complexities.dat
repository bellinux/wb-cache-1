40|$|AbstractThe way {{of dealing}} with the {{strongly}} increasing <b>complexity</b> of the company itself and its environment has become a key competitive factor. <b>Complexity</b> factors in a variety of different business areas require an advanced <b>Complexity</b> Management. Therefore, knowledge regarding the specifics of the respective <b>complexity,</b> the so-called <b>Complexity</b> Footprint, is decisive to meet requirements and to derive measures by using appropriate instruments. The current Fraunhofer IPA empirical study “advanced <b>Complexity</b> Management – the new management discipline” with more than 190 industrial participants shows, that companies expect a future increase in <b>complexity,</b> but not yet have the tools to deal with it. Furthermore, <b>complexity</b> management is mostly focused on the <b>complexity</b> field product and here in product modularization and variety management. The importance of ideal <b>complexity,</b> of product profitability in response to product <b>complexity</b> in connection with <b>complexity</b> in process and organization is mostly ignored. Within this paper the different activities and instruments of advanced <b>Complexity</b> Management are presented. This includes the approach of <b>complexity</b> patterns in value networks including production and supply chain as well as the summary of several <b>complexity</b> patterns to the Fraunhofer IPA <b>Complexity</b> Footprint. First an up-to-date survey on <b>complexity</b> in value networks is given. Then, the Stuttgart <b>complexity</b> comprehension is introduced. To define the external and internal <b>complexity</b> in socio-technical systems like value networks, the differences are presented. The difference between complicacy and <b>complexity</b> is given, within the <b>complexity</b> dimensions variety, heterogeneity, dynamics and opacity. After this, <b>complexity</b> fields such as goods and services, process and organization as well as their several subfields connectivity and interdependency are established.

30|$|<b>Complexity</b> {{drivers have}} a direct {{influence}} on {{the company and the}} value chain. <b>Complexity</b> drivers can be separated in internal and external drivers, depending on their origin. Internal <b>complexity</b> drivers can also be differentiated in correlated and autonomous <b>complexity</b> drivers. In the literature, more than 486 different internal and external <b>complexity</b> drivers were found during our research in 223 literature parts concerning <b>complexity</b> drivers in manufacturing companies and along the value chain. For clustering the 486 <b>complexity</b> drivers, we developed a superior classification system without overlaps between the different <b>complexity</b> driver categories based upon existing classification systems in the literature, provided by different authors. In summary, our new classification system consists of three main groups (external <b>complexity,</b> internal <b>complexity</b> and general <b>complexity),</b> four subcategories (society <b>complexity,</b> market <b>complexity,</b> internal correlated <b>complexity</b> and internal autonomous <b>complexity)</b> and twenty-two main <b>complexity</b> driver categories depending on their origin, characteristic and influences on other drivers (see Fig.  7). The identified 486 <b>complexity</b> drivers were clustered into these <b>complexity</b> driver categories and groups. The assignment to the different categories and groups was done depending on the <b>complexity</b> driver’s origin, characteristic and influences on other drivers. Figure  8 presents an overview about the <b>complexity</b> driver categories and their occurrence in the literature.

Further Schwenk-Willi [252] and Sun and Rose [266] argue that <b>complexity</b> drivers are necessary for operationalization and quantification of <b>complexity.</b> Greitemeyer, Meier and Ulrich [96] describe that <b>complexity</b> drivers are responsible for <b>complexity</b> costs.

50|$|In general, <b>complexity</b> is a {{something}} that has many parts in an intricate progression.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{introduce}} a new information-theoretic <b>complexity</b> measure for 2 -party functions, called Rényi information <b>complexity.</b> It is a lower-bound on communication <b>complexity,</b> and has the two leading lower-bounds on communication <b>complexity</b> as its natural relaxations: (external) information <b>complexity</b> and logarithm of partition <b>complexity.</b> These two lower-bounds had so far appeared conceptually quite different from each other, but we {{show that they are}} both obtained from Rényi information <b>complexity</b> using two different, but natural relaxations: 1. The relaxation of Rényi information <b>complexity</b> that yields information <b>complexity</b> is to change the order of Re&# 769;nyi mutual information used in its definition from infinity to 1. 2. The relaxation that connects Rényi information <b>complexity</b> with partition <b>complexity</b> is to replace protocol transcripts used in the definition of Rényi information <b>complexity</b> with what we term "pseudotranscripts", which omits the interactive nature of a protocol, but only requires that the probability of any transcript given inputs x and y to the two parties, factorizes into two terms which depend on x and y separately. While this relaxation yields an apparently different definition than (log of) partition function, we show that the two are in fact identical. This gives us a surprising characterization of the partition bound in terms of an information-theoretic quantity. We also show that if both the above relaxations are simultaneously applied to Rényi information <b>complexity,</b> we obtain a <b>complexity</b> measure that is lower-bounded by the (log of) relaxed partition <b>complexity,</b> a <b>complexity</b> measure introduced by Kerenidis et al.
