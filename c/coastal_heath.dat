5|$|Banksia epica is a shrub {{that grows}} {{on the south}} coast of Western Australia. A {{spreading}} bush with wedge-shaped serrated leaves and large creamy-yellow flower spikes, it grows up to 3½metres (11½ft) high. It is known only from two isolated populations in the remote south east of the state, near {{the western edge of}} the Great Australian Bight. Both populations occur among <b>coastal</b> <b>heath</b> on cliff-top dunes of siliceous sand.|$|E
5|$|It {{lives in}} most {{habitats}} with {{some form of}} tree cover up to 1500m (5000ft) above sea level. These include temperate beech rainforest (where it generally keeps to the canopy), wet and dry sclerophyll forest, woodland, Melaleuca shrubland, <b>coastal</b> <b>heath,</b> dwarf alpine conifer forest, sedgeland, buttongrass moors, tussock grassland, as well as fields, orchards and urban parks and gardens.|$|E
5|$|The hairpin banksia occurs {{along the}} east coast of Australia from the Dandenong Ranges east of Melbourne, Victoria, north through New South Wales and into Queensland. It is common north to Maryborough, with disjunct populations {{occurring}} as far north as the Atherton Tableland near Cairns. It occurs in a variety of habitats, from <b>coastal</b> <b>heath</b> (spinulosa and collina) and elevated rocky slopes (neoanglica and spinulosa) to inland dry sclerophyll forest dominated by eucalypts, where they form part of the understorey. Plants in exposed areas are generally considerably shorter than those in sheltered areas. It usually occurs on sand, but can be found in rocky clays or loams.|$|E

500|$|Banksia aemula, {{commonly}} known as the wallum banksia, is a shrub of the family Proteaceae. Found from Bundaberg south to Sydney on the Australian east coast, it is encountered as a shrub or a tree to [...] in <b>coastal</b> <b>heath</b> on deep sandy soil, known as Wallum. It has wrinkled orange bark and shiny green serrated leaves, with green-yellow flower spikes, known as inflorescences, appearing in autumn. The flower spikes turn grey as they age and large grey follicles appear. Banksia aemula resprouts from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, after bushfires.|$|E
500|$|Across its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{is found}} {{in a range of}} habitats—in open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in {{riparian}} woodlands. [...] It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) with ironbarks and stringybarks such as narrow-leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra) and silver-leaved ironbark (E. melanophloia), with a light shrubby understorey, and less often in dry open forests and woodlands dominated by Angophora, Acacia, Banksia, Casuarina or Callitris, or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) and woodlands dominated by snow gum (E. pauciflora) or white box (E. albens). It has been recorded in <b>coastal</b> <b>heath</b> when banksias are blooming, and among flowering mangroves. It occupies areas infested with weeds such as Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) and blackberries, and developed areas including orchards and parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after fire or logging, though it is more common in mature forests. Where it {{is found in}} woodland, it is usually woodland near forest or with an understory of sclerophyll plants.|$|E

2500|$|The Great Western Woodlands {{is close}} to [...] in extent, an area larger than England. Considering an area this large as a single unit for land-use {{planning}} is relatively new. Prior to 2006, {{the northern part of}} the region was often known locally as the ‘Goldfields’, with a plethora of local names used in the southern part. Researchers at the Australian National University mapped the Great Western Woodlands boundary using satellite-derived ‘Modis’ Data. The boundary separates the eucalypt woodlands from the mulga (Acacia aneura complex) dominated country to the north, the treeless Nullarbor Plain to the east, the higher rainfall <b>coastal</b> <b>heath</b> to the south east, and agricultural land to the west and south.|$|E
