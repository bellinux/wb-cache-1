40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} {{the accuracy of}} a set of surface patterns in identifying ironic sentences in <b>comments</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>by</b> users to an on-line newspaper. The initial focus is on identifying irony in sentences containing positive predicates since these sentences are more exposed to irony, making their true po-larity harder to recognize. We show {{that it is possible to}} find ironic sentences with relatively high precision (from 45 % to 85 %) by exploring certain oral or gestural clues in user comments, such as emoticons, onomatopoeic expressions for laughter, heavy punctuation marks, quotation marks and positive interjections. We also demonstrate that clues based on deeper linguistic information are relatively inefficient in capturing irony in user-generated content, which points to the need for exploring additional types of oral clues...|$|R

The approach taken by Berulava and Horsthemke is to quantify allelic-specific transcript levels in cells that are heterozygous for a given indicator variant in the mRNA of the gene of interest (in this case, rs 3929 in the 3 untrans-lated region of RBL 2). They measure the ratio of allele-specific transcripts for RBL 2 in three FTO SNP (rs 8050136) heterozygotous individuals (AC) and two homozygous individuals (AA) and report that skewing of RBL 2 allelic expression was detected but not significant.
