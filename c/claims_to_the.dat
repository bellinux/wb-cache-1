5|$|After his father's {{death in}} 1677, AmangkuratII also faced rival <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne. The most serious rival was his brother Pangeran Puger, {{who took the}} capital Plered in 1677 and did not {{surrender}} until 1681.|$|E
5|$|Before Henry's father (Henry VII) {{ascended the}} throne, England had been beset by civil warfare over rival <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English crown. Henry {{wanted to avoid}} a similar {{uncertainty}} over the succession. Catherine of Aragon's only surviving child was Princess Mary.|$|E
5|$|He has {{historically}} been credited {{with the discovery of}} oxygen, having isolated it in its gaseous state, although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Antoine Lavoisier also have strong <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> discovery.|$|E
50|$|He laid <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Irish baronetcy of Cox of Dunmanway, and styled {{himself with}} the honorific 'Sir'. However, after his death, the Privy Council {{rejected}} his son's <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> baronetcy.|$|R
50|$|Maximilian {{promised he}} would renounce his <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Polish throne only after {{crossing}} the Polish border. Upon {{his return to}} Vienna Maximilian failed to honor his pledge and renounce his <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Polish crown and would not do so until 1598.|$|R
50|$|In some ways, the {{supporters}} of Jacobitism may be placed in this category. The Jacobites were supporters of <b>the</b> Stuart house's <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English throne since 1688. <b>The</b> Jacobites survive <b>to</b> this day in their support for <b>the</b> Stuart family's <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English throne.|$|R
5|$|In 1098, Edgar of Scotland {{signed a}} treaty with Magnus that settled {{much of the}} {{boundary}} between the Scots and Norwegian claims in the islands. Edgar formally acknowledged the existing situation by giving up his <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hebrides and Kintyre.|$|E
5|$|After resigning, Rudd {{stated that}} he did not think Gillard could defeat the Coalition at the next {{election}} and that, since his resignation, he had received encouragement from Labor MPs and Cabinet Ministers to contest the leadership. Gillard responded to these developments by announcing a leadership ballot for the morning of 27 February 2012, saying that if she lost the vote she would return to the backbench and renounce any <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> leadership. She asked that Rudd make the same commitment.|$|E
5|$|Charles X Gustav {{fell ill}} in early 1660 and died on 23 February of that year. With his death, {{one of the}} major {{obstacles}} to peace was gone and the Treaty of Oliwa was signed on 23 April. Sweden was accepted as sovereign in Swedish Livonia, Brandenburg was accepted as sovereign in Ducal Prussia, and John II Casimir withdrew his <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Swedish throne, though he was to retain the title for life. All occupied territories were restored to their pre-war sovereigns.|$|E
5000|$|In 1937 the Irish Free State Government {{arranged}} for a plebiscite to approve a new Irish Constitution. Articles 2 and 3 of the new Constitution expressed a territorial <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "whole island of Ireland" [...] and thus an irredentist <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> territory of Northern Ireland. In addition, Article 4 provided that [...] "the name {{of the state is}} Éire, or, in the English language, Ireland". This too was seen by the British Government as another anti-partitionist attempt <b>to</b> lay <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whole of the island.|$|R

5|$|Clark is {{best known}} as a war hero of the Revolutionary War in the West, {{especially}} {{as the leader of the}} secret expeditionary forces that captured Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes in 1778–79. Some historians have suggested that the campaign supported American <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Northwest Territory during negotiations that resulted in the Treaty of Paris (1783).|$|E
5|$|The 1979 Moon Agreement {{was created}} to {{restrict}} the exploitation of the Moon's resources by any single nation, but as of 2014, it has been signed and ratified by only 16 nations, none of which engages in self-launched human space exploration or has plans to do so. Although several individuals have made <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Moon {{in whole or in}} part, none of these are considered credible.|$|E
5|$|The final witness {{called for}} the defence was Coventry. He {{was one of the}} non-playing members of the party who had {{witnessed}} no cheating, understood little about gambling and, as a non-soldier, knew nothing of Article 41 of the Queen's Regulations. When cross-examined by Clarke, Coventry confirmed that {{as far as he was}} aware, the witnesses had all decided to watch Gordon-Cumming's play on the second night, despite their <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contrary.|$|E

5|$|The name Belarus {{is closely}} related with the term Belaya Rus' , i.e., White Rus'. There are several <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> origin of the name White Rus'. An ethno-religious theory {{suggests}} that the name {{used to describe the}} part of old Ruthenian lands within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania that had been populated mostly by early Christianized Slavs, as opposed to Black Ruthenia, which was predominantly inhabited by pagan Balts.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{upstream}} toll bridges at Windsor and Maidenhead, {{the crossing}} at Datchet was toll-free for both River and road and {{quickly became a}} popular crossing. Seeking compensation for loss of income on their bridges, the corporations of Windsor and Maidenhead made <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Treasury. In 1708 Windsor was granted an ex-gratia payment of £55 (equivalent to £ today) plus £25 and £20 to two tenants (equivalent to £ and £ respectively). Maidenhead's complaint, not made until 1714, was noted but no compensation paid.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E

5|$|Alexander swore {{the oath}} of loyalty to the Greek {{constitution}} {{on the afternoon of}} 11 June 1917 in the ballroom of the Royal Palace. Apart from the Archbishop of Athens, Theocletus I, who administered the oath, only King Constantine I, Crown Prince George and the king's prime minister, Alexandros Zaimis, attended. There were no festivities. The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice and tears in his eyes as he made the solemn declaration. He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his brother had renounced their <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne. Constantine had informed his son that he should consider himself a regent, rather than a true monarch.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} the revolt of 1381 was {{the conduct of the}} war with France. In 1337 Edward III of England had pressed his <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French throne, {{beginning}} a long-running conflict that became known as the Hundred Years' War. Edward had initial successes, but his campaigns were not decisive. Charles V of France became more active in the conflict after 1369, taking advantage of his country's greater economic strength to commence cross-Channel raids on England. By the 1370s, England's armies on the continent were under huge military and financial pressure; the garrisons in Calais and Brest alone, for example, were costing £36,000 a year to maintain, while military expeditions could consume £50,000 in only six months. Edward died in 1377, leaving the throne to his grandson, Richard II, then only ten years old.|$|E
5|$|Another treaty dealing {{the matters}} of the {{northern}} borders was the Treaty of Novgorod signed with Norway in 1326, which ended the decades of the Norwegian-Novgorodian border skirmishes in Finnmark. Per the terms of this treaty, Norway relinquished all <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kola Peninsula. However, the treaty {{did not address the}} situation with the Sami people paying tribute to both Norway and Novgorod, and the practice continued until 1602. While the 1326 treaty did not define the border in detail, it confirmed the 1323 border demarcation, which remained more or less unchanged for the next six hundred years, until 1920.|$|E

5|$|As Mary was {{an infant}} when she {{inherited}} the throne, Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult. From the outset, there were two <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Regency: one from Catholic Cardinal Beaton, and the other from the Protestant Earl of Arran, who was next in line to the throne. Beaton's claim {{was based on a}} version of the late king's will that his opponents dismissed as a forgery. Arran, with the support of his friends and relations, became the regent until 1554 when Mary's mother managed to remove and succeed him.|$|E
5|$|As {{ruler of}} Thessalonica, Theodore quickly {{declared}} himself emperor, challenging the Nicaean emperor John III Vatatzes's <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine imperial throne. In 1225, he {{advanced to the}} outskirts of Constantinople, but his final attack against the seat of the much-reduced Latin Empire was delayed until 1230. In that year, Theodore amassed an army to besiege Constantinople, but then diverted it against Bulgaria, an ambivalent ally which threatened his northern flank. Theodore was defeated and captured at the Battle of Klokotnitsa, and spent the next seven years in captivity. In the meantime, he was succeeded by his brother Manuel. Manuel quickly lost Thrace, most of Macedonia, and Albania to the Bulgarian Tsar John II Asen. Thessalonica itself became a Bulgarian vassal, while in Epirus proper power was seized by Michael II, returning from exile.|$|E
5|$|Beginning work in 2011, the TIRC has {{referred}} 17 cases to {{the circuit court}} for judicial review for potential relief. Three convicts have been freed based on review of their cases. Individuals may initiate <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> commission. As of April 2016, another 130 cases have been heard of torture that was not committed by Burge or his subordinates. The city and state are struggling {{to determine how to}} treat this high number of torture victims in a just way. The sponsors of the bill tried to amend it in 2014 to expand its scope to all claims of torture by police in Chicago, but were unable to get support in the state house. They will try again.|$|E
