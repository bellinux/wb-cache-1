The feedwater subcools the saturated {{water from the}} moisture separators. This water now flows down the downcomer or annulus region, which is separated from the core by a tall shroud. The water then goes through either jet pumps or internal recirculation pumps that provide additional pumping power (hydraulic head). The water now makes a 180-degree turn and moves up through the lower <b>core</b> <b>plate</b> into the nuclear core, where the fuel elements heat the water. Water exiting the fuel channels at the top guide is saturated with a steam quality of about 15%.

40|$|The main {{objective}} with this thesis {{was to investigate}} experimentally and numerically the effect surface hardening has on the ballistic properties of monolithic and laminated mild steel plates. 300 x 300 mm^ 2 plates of thicknesses 12 mm, 6 mm, and 4 mm were made from a low carbon structural steel (NVE 36) and combined {{in such a way}} that the total thickness always was 12 mm. Some of the plates were then surface hardened by the Kverneland Group to obtain different hardness profiles; (1) as-received, (2) very hard surface with a soft core and (3) very hard surface with a hard core. Ballistic impact tests were performed at SIMLab, NTNU, using 7. 62 mm AP bullets. From these tests, the Recht-Ipson model was used to obtain ballistic limit curves for all layered/hardened configurations. The experiments showed that surface hardening had a positive effect on the ballistic resistance compared to the as-received material, while lamination did not seem to influence the results significantly. The surface hardened plates suffered from radial cracks and fragmentation during penetration, while the as-received material failed by ductile hole growth. Material properties were obtained by conducting tensile tests and microhardness measurements. The material tests revealed that the plates had not been hardened to their expected hardness profiles. This affected the comparison between a soft core and a hard core configuration. The modified Johnson-Cook constitutive relation and the Cockcroft-Latham fracture criterion were chosen to represent the material behaviour. Identification of material constants was done by direct calibration in combination with Bridgman s analysis, and by inverse modelling using LS-OPT. Numerical simulations of the impact tests were conducted in IMPETUS Afea Solver with higher order 3 D volume elements. Surface hardened plates were modelled with a varying yield stress over the thickness by use of scaling factors obtained from the material tests. The numerical results were finally compared with the experimental findings. IMPETUS was able to describe the main trends from the experiment and the numerical results were conservative for all the analyses. Additionally, a numerical case study was performed with nominal hardness profiles. The study showed that nominal hard <b>core</b> <b>plates</b> performed better than nominal soft <b>core</b> <b>plates,</b> while layering did not seem to affect the result significantly...|$|R

The model is designed {{for the analysis of}} severe accidents in LWRs, wherein melted <b>core</b> <b>plate</b> material may slump onto the top of a porous bed of relocated core material supported by the lower head. The permeation of the melted <b>core</b> <b>plate</b> material into the porous debris bed influences the heatup of the debris bed and the heatup of the lower head supporting the debris. A model for mass transport of melted metallic material is applied that includes terms for viscosity and turbulence but neglects inertial and capillary terms because of their small value relative to gravity and viscous terms in the momentum equation. The relative permeability and passability of the porous debris are calculated as functions of debris porosity, particle size, and effective saturation. An iterative numerical solution is used to solve the set of nonlinear equations for mass transport. The effective thermal conductivity of the debris is calculated as a function of porosity, particle size, and saturation. The model integrates the equations for mass transport with a model for the two-dimensional conduction of heat through porous debris. The integrated model has been implemented into the SCDAP/RELAP 5 code for the analysis of the integrity of LWR lower heads during severe accidents. The results of the model indicate that melted <b>core</b> <b>plate</b> material may permeate to near the bottom of a 1 m deep hot porous debris bed supported by the lower head.
