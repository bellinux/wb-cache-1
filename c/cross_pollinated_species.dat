An evaluation of twenty-four Candidate Plus Trees [CPTs] of pongamia was carried out to elucidate the extent of genetic variability, correlation available among the pod and seed traits for diversity analysis and use in breeding. Eleven CPTs were promising for 100 -pod weight, seed length, 100 -seed weight and oil content. CPT – 19 had good combination for seven traits viz. pod length [65. 5 mm], 100 - pod weight [541. 3 g], 2 D surface area [348. 7 mm 2], seed length [27. 7 mm], seed breadth [17. 4 mm], 100 -seed weight [202. 3 g] and oil content [28. 5...|$|E

This would be an important genotype to follow further and use in breeding program. CPT – 14 showed the lowest expression for 100 -seed weight [107. 6 g] and oil content [28. 5 %]. High estimates of heritability and high genetic advance observed for 100 -pod weight, 100 -seed weight and oil content, indicated the possibility of their improvement by selection. Oil content was particularly correlated at genotypic and phenotypic levels with 100 -seed weight [rg = 0. 62, rp = 0. 58] and 100 -pod weight [0. 50, 0. 46]. The first four Principal Component [PCs] explained large portion [86. 4 %] of the total variation. Cluster analysis resulted into two broad clusters with cluster- 1 having 6 CPTs and cluster- 2 having 18 CPTs. Six CPTs in cluster- 1 [CPT – 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 19] had combination of desirable traits and can be directly selected for further improvement by breeding...|$|E

40|$|Buckwheat {{exhibits}} {{the great}} extent of variability of featu-res and its productivity {{is far from}} being constant. 2000 plants were investigated in 1984 - 1987. The following features in Polish, Japanese and Soviet varieties were investigated: the size of poli-anths, the length of pistils, 1000 grains weight (g) and the num-ber of inflorescences and ramifications. It has been determined that plants of the Pin type set smaller perianths than those of the Thrum type no matter what the variety is. The same regularity also applies to 1000 grains weight (g). The size of a perianth does not influence the length of a pistil, and it is the relation of the pistil length to the stamen length which determines the type of a flower. The investigated features show a great changeability, and the perianth size may be considered to be a varietal charecter. Buckwheat is a <b>cross</b> <b>pollinating</b> <b>species</b> <b>pollinated</b> by insects. Heterostyly occurs in the Fagopyrum genus. Forms having long pis...|$|R
40|$|The {{components}} of genetic variation and genetic gain obtained with three selection methods - individual, combined and multi-effect index selection - were compared in rubber tree [Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex Adr. de Juss.) Muell. Arg. ] progenies. The rubber tree is a <b>cross</b> <b>pollinating</b> <b>species</b> with a mixed reproductive {{system in which}} the self pollination rate is 22 %. Twenty-two half sib progenies were planted at experimental stations at Pindorama, Votuporanga and Jaú, in São Paulo State, using a randomized and complete block design, with five replications and ten plants per plot. Dry rubber production was assessed when the plants were three years old. Based on the genetic variability of the populations, Pindorama was the best environment for the expression of variability. At the individual level, heritability was seriously affected when random progenies from an open pollinating population were considered as half sib progenies. Considerable overestimation of genetic gains occurred during individual, combined and multi-effect index selection when the rubber tree reproductive system was not considered as mixed. Selection based on the multi-effect index maximizes genetic progress and should be used more in rubber tree breeding programs...|$|R

A large proportion of these markers (164) were polymorphic both among mulberry species and genotypes.

40|$|Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima is {{generally}} a self incompatible, <b>cross</b> <b>pollinated</b> perennial <b>species</b> which grows from Mediterranean coasts to European Atlantic coasts. Thirty-four accessions {{of this species}} obtained from the BGRC collection located at Braunschweig (Germany) were evaluated for nine quantitative traits under the sub tropical climate of North India. The characters studied were root weight, root length, crown size, number of rings, shape and color of leaf, leaf length and width, the ratio of leaf length to leaf width, petiole length, flowering (annual! biennial), and tolerance to temperatures of 40 °C and above. Multivariate analysis revealed variation within and among groups of accessions and identified important traits to consider in a selection program. Four principal compo nents (PCs) accounted for 82 % of the variability. The first PC accounted for 44 % of the variability and was as sociated with root weight, root length, and crown diam eter. The second PC was associated with top weight and accounted for 20 % of the variability. Cluster analysis by a non-hierarchical method resulted in six clusters, the larg est cluster having nine genotypes, the smallest two...|$|R
