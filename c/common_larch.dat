50|$|Pulvinone, {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{belonging to the}} esters, lactones, alcohols and butenolides classes, is a yellow crystalline solid. Although the pulvinone is not a natural product, several naturally occurring hydroxylated derivatives are known. These hydroxylated pulvinones are produced by fungal species, such as the in Europe <b>common</b> <b>Larch</b> Bolete (Boletus elegans, also known as Suillus grevillei), or by moulds such as Aspergillus Terreus.|$|E
50|$|Suillus viscidus {{forms an}} ectomycorrhizal {{association}} with larch (Larix) specifically, and its distribution is thus {{limited by the}} range of the host tree. It occurs throughout Europe, and also in Japan. In Europe, it is considered an uncommon to rare fungus and it {{is to be found in}} the same habitat as the <b>common</b> <b>larch</b> bolete, Suillus grevillei, and also the rare Suillus tridentinus. Fruiting bodies are found in groups among grass under larch, from summer to autumn.|$|E
50|$|This {{bark beetle}} feeds on the {{developing}} bark on {{and around the}} root crowns of tree seedlings, especially the phloem. It also infests stumps, logs, and fallen trees. It prefers pines, and is a widespread pest of wild and cultivated Monterey pines (Pinus radiata) in particular. Other recorded host trees include silver fir (Abies alba), colonial pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), Port Orford cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), <b>common</b> <b>larch</b> (Larix decidua), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens).|$|E
50|$|Macaria sexmaculata, {{known by}} the <b>common</b> names green <b>larch</b> looper, larch looper or six-spotted angle, is a moth of the family Geometridae. It is found from Alaska to Nunavut and Newfoundland, south in the east to Massachusetts and south {{in the west to}} Oregon.|$|R
50|$|Aphidecta obliterata (<b>common</b> name <b>larch</b> ladybird, or larch ladybug) is {{a species}} of Coccinellidae, a flying beetle, {{approximately}} 4 - 5mm in size. Its color ranges from tan to brown, brown legs, and a dark oblique line posteriorly. While other types of ladybugs have prominent spots, this insect has smaller, less distinct spots, if any. Their habitat is needled conifers, especially the larch, {{but they can also}} be found on other plants and trees like pines and firs. Their diet, and plants nearby the local trees, they live on aphids.|$|R
50|$|On the {{territory}} of the plateau <b>common</b> features include <b>larch</b> and pine forests and birch. In the south is characterized by shrub thickets of oak and set of marshes and wetlands. Mostly found sporadic permafrost. The climate is continental with features of the monsoon, with cold, snowless winters and moderately warm summers. There are places gold deposits. The first information on the plateau were obtained Russian pioneers in the 17th century.|$|R
50|$|Larix decidua, <b>common</b> name European <b>larch,</b> is {{a species}} of larch native to the {{mountains}} of central Europe, in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains {{as well as the}} Pyrenees, with disjunct lowland populations in northern Poland and southern Lithuania. Its life span is given by different authorities as anything between 100 and 350 years, but the most reliable is normally about 200 years. It is claimed that one of the larches planted by the second Duke of Atholl at Dunkeld in 1738 is still standing.|$|R
50|$|Gillies Hill {{displays}} a considerable diversity of habitats from Scots pine/heath to semi-natural woodland of ash, oak and rowan.The {{following are the}} habitat divisions of the hill as classified in a Phase 1 habitat survey conducted in 2010: Broadleaved semi-natural woodland, Broadleaved plantation woodland, Coniferous plantation woodland, Mixed semi-natural woodland, Dense continuous scrub, Scattered scrub, Recently felled coniferous woodland, Semi-natural neutral grassland, Marshy grassland, Continuous Bracken, Standing water, Running water, and Rock exposure & waste/quarry. Dominant species found on Gillies Hill include sycamore, birch, broom, <b>common</b> ash, beech, <b>larch,</b> bracken, spruce, oak and willow.|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} from September 2008 to July 2009 in the Grunwald {{district}} {{in the city of}} Poznań, Poland, a total of 609 localities of flowering English ivy were recorded, for which 769 plants were described. These plants were found in different localities, most of them euhemerobic. The biggest number of flowering specimens was recorded in home gardens. Support for climbing plants was mainly provided by trees and shrubs, including fruit trees – pear and apple trees. Among the other tree species, the biggest group comprises Scots pine, <b>common</b> birch, European <b>larch</b> and <b>common</b> locust. Other types of supports included fences, buildings and elements of small architecture. A very high number of specimens in the generative stage in the Grunwald district indicates considerable popularity {{and at the same time}} very good adaptation of ivy not only to the climatic conditions of the city of Poznań, but also to anthropogenic changes in the habitat...|$|R
40|$|In {{the forests}} of the Baikal Lake basin annual fire {{activity}} historically has been higher as compared to surrounding forest areas due to specific climatic conditions and altitude-controlled vegetation structure. The regional forests, predominantly light coniferous, develop under a high or, in dry years, extreme-fire-activity regime. <b>Common</b> pine and <b>larch</b> tree stands of fire origin are periodically thinned by fire. The productivity of the fire-intact parts of such stands decreases {{as a result of}} fire-caused soil condition disturbances. In extreme fire years, large fires cover landscapes and lead to irreversible forest ecosystem degradation and, hence, to local deforestation. In the past, forest fire activity and area burned increased with increasing use of the regional forests beginning with hunting, wood extraction by dwellers of local settlements, Trans-Siberian Rail Road building and, finally, industrial-scale logging. In 1970 – 1980, the regional fire situation was successfully controlled due to improvements of forest use and protection. However, the recently relaxed forest economy standards have resulted in loss of the progress achieved...|$|R
40|$|The article {{reviews the}} ability of {{coniferous}} (<b>common</b> pine, siberian <b>larch</b> and siberian spruce) stands growing in 9 municipal districts of the Irkutsk region to absorb СО 2 technogenic emission of heat power plants. (EIGAF) index is suggested to characterize gas-absorbing (СО 2 –absorbing) activity; the index reflects proportion between СО 2 technogenic emission and photosynthetic productivity (GPP) of coniferous tree stands. СО 2 –absorbing capacity in 8 of the monitored districts {{has been shown to}} significantly exceed the amount of carbon dioxide emission from heat power sector. The index values EIGAF= 0. 01 - 0. 97 demonstrate that СО 2 technogenic emission amounts to 1 - 97 % of coniferous stands photosynthetic productivity in the areas under study. At the same time, the most industrially developed Angarsk district shows СО 2 photosynthetic absorption to be 8 - 12 times lower than technogenic СО 2 emission. Reasons of low gas-absorbing capacity of coniferous tree stands of this area are discussed...|$|R
