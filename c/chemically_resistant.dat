5|$|The <b>chemically</b> <b>resistant</b> (but expensive) {{fluorinated}} ionomers {{are used}} as electrochemical cell membranes, of which {{the first and most}} prominent example is Nafion. Developed in the 1960s, it was initially deployed as fuel cell material in spacecraft and then replaced mercury-based chloralkali process cells. Recently, the fuel cell application has reemerged with efforts to install proton exchange membrane fuel cells into automobiles. Fluoroelastomers such as Viton are crosslinked fluoropolymer mixtures mainly used in O-rings; perfluorobutane (C4F10) is used as a fire-extinguishing agent.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride is a heat- and <b>chemically</b> <b>resistant</b> {{refractory}} {{compound of}} boron and nitrogen with the chemical formula BN. It exists in various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice. The hexagonal form corresponding to graphite {{is the most}} stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic (sphalerite structure) variety analogous to diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare wurtzite BN modification is similar to lonsdaleite and may even be harder than the cubic form.|$|E
5|$|Vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to {{strengthen}} the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels {{to keep them from}} collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress. Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a <b>chemically</b> <b>resistant</b> polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period.|$|E

25|$|Polypropylene is at room {{temperature}} resistant to fats and almost all organic solvents, apart from strong oxidants. Non-oxidizing acids and bases {{can be stored in}} containers made of PP. At elevated temperature, PP can be dissolved in nonpolarity solvents such as xylene, tetralin and decalin. Due to the tertiary carbon atom PP is <b>chemically</b> less <b>resistant</b> than PE (see Markovnikov rule).|$|R
25|$|French chemist Henri Moissan, {{formerly}} one of Frémy's students, {{continued the}} search. After trying many different approaches, he built on Frémy and Gore's earlier attempts by combining potassium bifluoride and hydrogen fluoride. The resultant solution conducted electricity. Moissan also constructed especially corrosion-resistant equipment: containers crafted from {{a mixture of}} platinum and iridium (more <b>chemically</b> <b>resistant</b> than pure platinum) with fluorite stoppers.|$|E
25|$|PVC is <b>chemically</b> <b>resistant</b> to acids, salts, bases, fats, and alcohols; therefore, {{it is used}} in {{sewerage}} piping. It is also {{resistant to}} some solvents, mainly uPVC. Plasticized PVC, also known as PVC-P, is in some cases less resistant to solvents. For example, PVC is resistant to fuel and some paint thinners. Some solvents may only swell it or deform it but not dissolve it, but some of them, like tetrahydrofuran or acetone, may damage it.|$|E
500|$|The {{atoms of}} carbon can bond {{together}} in different ways, termed allotropes of carbon. The best known are graphite, diamond, and amorphous carbon. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough {{to form a}} streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb [...] "γράφειν" [...] which means [...] "to write"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form. They are <b>chemically</b> <b>resistant</b> and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Terrestrial plants make leaf waxes to {{coat the}} {{surfaces}} of their leaves as an adaptation to minimize water loss. These waxes are largely straight-chain n-alkyl lipids. They are insoluble, non-volatile, <b>chemically</b> inert, and <b>resistant</b> to degradation, making them easily preserved in the sedimentary record, and therefore good targets as biomarkers.|$|R
50|$|It is {{composed}} primarily of petroleum distillates, including mineral oil (60-100%), mineral spirits {10-30%}, tricresyl phosphate (an antiwear and extreme pressure additive in lubricants, 0.1-1.0%), ortho dichlorobenzene (a softening and removing agent for carbon-based contamination on metal surfaces, 0.1-1.0%), and para dichlorobenzene (a precursor {{used in the}} production of <b>chemically</b> and thermally <b>resistant</b> polymers, <0.1%).|$|R
25|$|When skiing, the {{friction}} between the snow and skis causes wax to abrade and remain in the snow pack until spring thaw. Then the snowmelt drains into watersheds, streams, lakes and rivers, thereby changing the chemistry {{of the environment and}} the food chain. Perfluorocarbons in ski wax are heat <b>resistant,</b> <b>chemically</b> and biologically stable, and thus environmentally persistent.|$|R
500|$|Polonium {{is highly}} {{dangerous}} {{and has no}} biological role. By mass, polonium-210 is around 250,000 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide (the [...] for 210Po is less than 1 microgram for an average adult (see below) compared with about 250 milligrams for hydrogen cyanide). The main hazard is its intense radioactivity (as an alpha emitter), which {{makes it difficult to}} handle safely. Even in microgram amounts, handling 210Po is extremely dangerous, requiring specialized equipment (a negative pressure alpha glove box equipped with high-performance filters), adequate monitoring, and strict handling procedures to avoid any contamination. Alpha particles emitted by polonium will damage organic tissue easily if polonium is ingested, inhaled, or absorbed, although they do not penetrate the epidermis and hence are not hazardous as long as the alpha particles remain outside the body. Wearing <b>chemically</b> <b>resistant</b> and intact gloves is a mandatory precaution to avoid transcutaneous diffusion of polonium directly through the skin. Polonium delivered in concentrated nitric acid can easily diffuse through inadequate gloves (e.g., latex gloves) or the acid may damage the gloves.|$|E

50|$|It {{is used as}} a disinfectant, pesticide, and deodorant, most familiarly in mothballs {{in which}} it is a {{replacement}} for the more traditional naphthalene because of naphthalene's greater flammability (though both chemicals have the same NFPA 704 rating).

5|$|They have {{membranes}} {{composed of}} glycerol-ether lipids, whereas bacteria and eukaryotes have membranes composed mainly of glycerol-ester lipids. The {{difference is the}} type of bond that joins the lipids to the glycerol moiety; the two types are shown in yellow in the figure at the right. In ester lipids this is an ester bond, whereas in ether lipids this is an ether bond. Ether bonds are <b>chemically</b> more <b>resistant</b> than ester bonds. This stability might help archaea to survive extreme temperatures and very acidic or alkaline environments. Bacteria and eukaryotes do contain some ether lipids, but in contrast to archaea these lipids are not a major part of their membranes.|$|R
2500|$|Soil {{aggregation}} can physically protect {{organic carbon}} from decay by soil microbes. More aggregate formation {{can result in}} more soil carbon storage. There is much evidence that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increase soil aggregate formation, and that aggregate formation may be mediated by the arbuscular mycorrhizal protein glomalin. Therefore, even if glomalin itself is not exceptionally recalcitrant and <b>chemically</b> <b>resistant</b> to decomposition (as described above) it may still contribute to soil carbon storage by physically protecting other organic matter from decomposition by promoting soil aggregation.|$|E

40|$|Resistant {{starches}} (RS) {{can be used}} in {{the food}} industry aiming to enhance the dietary fibre content and reduce the glycaemic response of food. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the physical and chemical properties of different resistant starches (origin, type of resistance) and their comparison with native starches in pure form and in stoichiometric mixtures. Measurements were carried out to determine enzymatic digestibility, water absorption, thermogravimetric parameters (DSC), and viscometric characteristics (RVA) of resistant and native starches and their mixtures. Enzymatic digestibility and water absorption were reduced linearly by adding resistant starches into the mixtures. RVA parameters have shown non-proportional character in the stoichiometric mixtures. The results of DSC measurements proved that the gelatinisation of resistant starches is quite different and only <b>chemically</b> modified <b>resistant</b> starch was heat-sensitive. Results indicated that circumspect evaluation is needed in the selection of resistant starch products for the development and innovation of food products with reduced glycaemic response...|$|R
40|$|Laterite is an iron-rich, sub-aerial, {{weathering}} product, commonly {{considered to}} evolve {{as a result}} of intense, in situ substrate alteration under tropical or sub-tropical climatic conditions. It comprises an important subset of a wider range of ferruginous, and related aluminous (i. e. bauxitic), weathering products which include ferricretes and various iron-rich palaeosols. Laterite weathering profiles often develop an indurated surface layer of resistant duricrust, forming laterally extensive sheets c. 1 – 20 m in thickness (Figure 1). These lateritized surfaces are both <b>chemically</b> and physically <b>resistant</b> and may extend over areas of a few, to hundreds, or even thousands of square kilometres...|$|R

30|$|The {{protective}} {{effect of a}} sol–gel silica coating was tested on two kinds of potash-lime-silica glass, one richer in K and Na {{and the other one}} richer in silica and Ca and therefore <b>chemically</b> more <b>resistant.</b> In particular the effectiveness of the coating to weathering and accelerated ageing was checked. The coating protects efficiently both types of glasses from the corrosive effect of an atmosphere with 1  ppm SO 2 and 80 % RH. After increasing the concentration of SO 2 up to 10  ppm, no modification could be noticed for the coated part of the most durable glass (M 3), even after 4  weeks of ageing. The less resistant glass (M 1) showed the formation of small crystals (< 1  µm) on the coated surface after the same exposure. SEM investigation has revealed that the crystals do not increase in size but in number with an increase in weathering time. Nevertheless, the {{protective effect}} is clearly visible when comparing the coated and the uncoated part of the same glass. ToF–SIMS analysis revealed that the ion distribution in the coating is not modified by a long and aggressive exposure to artificial weathering except in the uppermost domain of approximately 100  nm.|$|R
