50|$|Of Fanger's inventions, {{one is the}} <b>coaxial</b> <b>speaker.</b> He filed Patent No. 1895071 on Sep. 25, 1928, granted Jan. 24, 1933. The patent {{described}} what was later known as the <b>coaxial</b> <b>speaker,</b> incorporating a small high frequency horn with its own diaphragm set inside a large cone loudspeaker. This technology {{was based on the}} variable-area principle, which made the center cone light and stiff to accommodate high frequencies, while the outer cone was flexible and highly damped to accommodate lower frequencies.|$|E

50|$|Hermann Josef Fanger (aka Herman Fanger) (27 Mar 1895 - Aug 1971) was a Swiss-born {{inventor}} {{best known}} for contributions to the <b>coaxial</b> <b>speaker.</b> He {{was born in the}} small town of Sarnen, Switzerland to Johann Joseph Fanger and Babetta Notter. He emigrated to the United States early in adulthood. He lived in Los Gatos, California where he died in 1971.|$|E

5000|$|There {{has been}} much {{confusion}} about the original 601 {{due to the fact}} that very few were made, with almost no survivors, and because the model name was re-used in the 1950s for a completely different Altec Lansing Duplex driver. The 1950s version of the 601 was a 12" [...] diameter <b>coaxial</b> <b>speaker</b> with a miniature HF compression driver mounted within the motor of the LF driver using permanent magnets. This confusion was exacerbated in 1988 when Altec Lansing misidentified the later 12" [...] 601 as the original 601 in their own promotional literature celebrating their 50th anniversary. That mistake was carried forth for years in subsequent Altec Lansing literature. However, at least one original field coil 601 is known to exist (S/N 150) and has been confirmed as a 15" [...] model. In addition, copies of the original sales literature exist that accurately describe it.|$|E
5000|$|Frustrated {{first with}} Pacific {{and then with}} Heider, and enticed by the new CBS 16-track studio, Rubinson began {{bringing}} his artists to CBS Recording in the early 1970s. He moved his operations to offices {{on the second floor}}, above the recording studios; his own large office was formerly used by Coppola. For some time, Rubinson had been shuttling between recording sessions in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and he felt that his schedule was too hectic. He determined to make recordings only in San Francisco, in a studio that he could use as he saw fit. He made an offer to CBS to take over Studio C, paying an annual lease on the space to Vitlin's son and heir, attorney Victor Vitlin. CBS would supply the infrastructure, the microphones, and studio maintenance and reception services. To differentiate his business, Rubinson decided to install a new mixing console as well as multitrack recording equipment. Catero would be the chief engineer for the new room. In late 1976, Rubinson and CBS signed the deal and Rubinson began bringing clients to the Automatt. Rubinson also leased a rehearsal room on the second floor which once housed Coppola's film studio. He selected the name [...] "the Automatt" [...] as a play on the old style of coin-operated food vending restaurants in New York called [...] "automats", and because his mixing console was equipped with an advanced new feature: the first practical recording studio automation system in San Francisco. Rubinson bought a Harrison 4032 mixing console with programmable mute keys, and he had a Michael Larner-assembled Allison Research Memory-Plus Automation System based on the Zilog Z80 microprocessor. The Allison system was capable of handling 40 microphone inputs mixing down to 32 tracks on tape, and it could store 65,536 separate functions. Larner also assembled for Rubinson an interface called Autopunch which automated the controls of the MCI 24-track tape machine. As well, the Automatt offered a 4-track monitor system for the musicians, a revolutionary development which gave each performer greater freedom to optimize his or her own headphones mix. The studio monitors were Big Reds, popular boxes based on the Altec Lansing Duplex 604 <b>coaxial</b> <b>speaker,</b> powered by McIntosh MC75 tube monoblock amplifiers.|$|E
40|$|Looking {{for future}} projects, the {{possibility}} to have optimum conditions to perform microphone tests and any noise measurements of different small devices which will be constructed in the university, the need to construct a anechoic chamber was considered, so in this thesis a research about anechoic chambers was made. An acoustic anechoic chamber is a shielded room designed for performing sound measurements under conditions close to free space. Due to the difficulties that might entail {{the construction of a}} large anechoic room, we addressed the design of a chamber with smaller dimensions. This way we try to have an enclosure with conditions close to free field {{and to be able to}} perform the necessary tests with a low-cost construction. The research group wants to build an environmental emulator to test their sensor networks that are used for environmental noise study. By using multiple small rooms they want to emulate a bigger space. This report summarizes the design and construction of a small anechoic chamber, with a focus on microphone testing. Finally a low cost prototype of a small anechoic room will be built, in which we would perform the tests. The prototype has been built with low cost materials that are MDF for the walls, and fiber glass for the absorbent material. A sound actuation system has been designed too. The latter being made up of an amplifier and two speakers. The first speaker is a <b>coaxial</b> <b>speaker</b> for generating pink or white noise or sweeps. The second speaker is the tweeter to generate pure tones. For the <b>coaxial</b> <b>speaker</b> it was necessary to build a baffle. A baffle was designed in order to achieve the best performance of the loudspeaker. Finally, the design was made for a small anechoic room. We took into account the Eigen-modes, the absorption, the insulation and predominant axis of measurement as major factors of consideration. So insulation, absorption and construction issues are detailed and addressed, creating a base for the experimental evaluation for a following project.

50|$|There {{are rare}} {{exceptions}} that use multiple elements {{to drive a}} common diaphragm, but these {{should not be confused}} with <b>coaxial</b> <b>speakers</b> that use separate and concentrically aligned elements to achieve the desired range of reproduction, and are not, strictly, classified as full-range drivers.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2006 they unveiled a high-end 4-way unit and presented the theoric approach in a paper at the Audio Engineering Society. This system, released in 2007, is called La Sphère and consists of two spheric <b>coaxial</b> <b>speakers,</b> a filter and four power amplifiers.|$|R
50|$|SpeakerCraft {{invented the}} WavePlane, a baffle that {{isolates}} the tweeter from the woofer in a <b>coaxial</b> ceiling <b>speaker,</b> {{which results in}} improved high frequency dispersion and fidelity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coaxial</b> <b>speakers</b> in {{automobiles}} are 2- or 3-way loudspeakers {{in which}} the tweeter, or the tweeter and a mid-range driver, are mounted {{in front of the}} woofer, partially obscuring it. The advantage of this design is the ability to use a smaller area, hence their popularity in car audio. The low frequency sound waves from the woofer are not reduced too much by the drivers in their path. Without time-alignment correction, the sound from the tweeter may arrive slightly before the sound from the woofer; this misalignment is not generally addressed in automobile sound systems.|$|R
5000|$|It {{became a}} {{household}} name {{as a result of}} supplying PA systems to the armed forces during World War II, and to Butlins and Pontins holiday camps after the war. Identification being such because the company logo name was prominently shown on the speaker grills. This usage is current as of mid-2010. Tannoy is famous for its 'Dual Concentric' speaker design, which places the tweeter behind the centre of the medium or bass driver. [...] "Dual Concentric" [...] is a trademark although Tannoy is not the only speaker manufacturer to design <b>coaxial</b> <b>speakers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Altec Lansing {{produced}} {{a line of}} professional and high-fidelity audio equipment, starting with a line of horn-based loudspeaker systems. First developed for use in motion picture theaters, these products were touted for their fidelity, efficiency and high sound level capability. Products included [...] "biflex" [...] speakers where frequency range was increased by a flexible [...] "decoupling" [...] of a small center area of the speaker's cone from a larger [...] "woofer" [...] area; the 604-series of <b>coaxial</b> <b>speakers</b> employed a high efficiency compression driver mounted {{to the rear of}} the 604's low-frequency magnet, and exited through a multicellular horn that passed through center of the woofer's cone.|$|R

5000|$|As of 1985, trim {{levels that}} were offered were the MG, ME, and ME-R for the sedan. Earlier trim {{packages}} were the VXR, VX, and VL, all using the CVCC-II induction setup. Honda's {{fuel injection system}} was offered on the VTL-i, and VT-i. As the hatchback continued to be manufactured as an Accord only, the Vigor hatchback was available with the trim packages MX-T, and the ME-T until it {{was replaced by the}} Honda Integra 2-door hatchback in 1984. Earlier trim packages for the Vigor hatchback were the TXL, TX, and TU using the carburetor, and the TT-i with fuel injection. Vehicles that were installed with fuel injection no longer used the CVCC system. Some of the standard equipment on the MX-T hatchback and the MG and ME sedans included cruise control, 2 position 4 Wheel auto leveling suspension, fuel usage computer, AM/FM cassette stereo and two Coaxial loudspeakers, flow through ventilation, velour interior with split folding rear seats, and a rear cargo cover for the hatchbacks. The higher trim level ME-T hatchback and the ME-R also included delayed interior illumination (called [...] "theater lighting"), four <b>coaxial</b> <b>speakers</b> with the stereo system, power windows and locks, disc brakes front and rear, and speed sensitive power steering.|$|R
5000|$|Under the {{guidance}} of the University Athletic audio engineers, the JAR received a major upgrade in the fan atmosphere experience. At construction, the JAR employed a distributed horn powered PA system with very narrow dispersion angles, coupled with near-proximity <b>coaxial</b> <b>speakers</b> for the upper deck. This setup lead to several hot zones and many fans wondering what the announcer said. That changed in 2005 with the installation of a fully zoned system employing EVH model horn loaded boxes coupled with 6 TX Series subwoofers in the South catwalk for that tipoff [...] "Thunderstruck" [...] kick. A separate zone was also included for the floor for the UA Dance Team and Basketball team warmups. Precision series EV combined amplifiers and DSPs tune the system to near perfection in every seat. A Midas Venice series mixing console along with several channels of external dynamic channel processing, as well as enhanced hyperspheric modulation accelerators, handle all audio inputs. The system has reached a maximum decibel level of 115 dB during games, and is rated up to 130 dB. The facility currently seats 5,500 people. The arena has two floors. In addition to the court, the first level features locker rooms, a sports medicine and training facility, a ticket office, a fan team shop and meeting rooms.|$|R
5000|$|In 1957, Kolbe {{returned}} to Switzerland and in 1960 {{he founded the}} Phonag Record Company in Winterthur, with the label Helvetia. The company mainly produced Swiss folklore records. In Winterthur, Kolbe recorded at the Kirchgemeindehaus, which had a room with very good acoustics. From 1962, Kolbe's second engineer and apprentice was Robert Lattmann. In April 1966, Kolbe improved his equipment from three small portable microphone mixers without equalizers, dual meters and a ReVox tape recorder to a portable 3-channel tube mixing console, designed and manufactured by Hans Leonhard (Leonhard Electronics, Zürich). This console, which had switchable equalizers co-designed by Kolbe, was used in his studios in Winterthur and Lindau and on most on-location recordings for CBS and Phonag. In October 1966, at the Kirchgemeindehaus in Winterthur Kolbe recorded the Isaac Stern Trio playing the Beethoven Piano Trios, Op. 97, the [...] "Archduke".On 29 June 1970, Kolbe opened a recording studio in Lindau canton, Zürich, Switzerland. The studio measured 161 square meters over two floors. It had a small stage used as storage area. The technical facilities were in a control room with a double-glass window to the studio. Kolbe's first recording console was the modular portable Leonhard valve mixing desk and he used Tannoy integrated concentric <b>coaxial</b> <b>speakers</b> and Studer tape recorders. In 1975, the studio was upgraded to a 16 track transistorised MCI desk and Studer A80 8-16 track recorders. Between 1972 and 1975 Jimmy Duncombe, later co-founder of the Powerplay recording studio in Maur, Switzerland, was the studio manager and recording engineer.|$|R
