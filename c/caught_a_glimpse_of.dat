25|$|Lallemand, it is recorded, <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> red-coated {{figures in}} the woods to his left and rode to alert General Peyremmont, who was leading the 2nd Hussars. Peyremmont scorned Lallemand's concerns, saying that the British dragoons were {{probably}} a small detachment who had lost their way.|$|E
25|$|Eurasian magpie (Pica pica): The Eurasian magpie is {{the only}} non-mammal to have passed the mirror test. Researchers applied a small red, yellow or black sticker to the throat of five Eurasian magpies, {{where they could be}} seen by the bird only by using a mirror. The birds were then given a mirror. The feel of the sticker on their throats did not seem to alarm the magpies. However, when the birds with {{coloured}} stickers <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> themselves in the mirror, they scratched at their throats—a clear indication that they recognised the image in the mirror as their own. Those that received a black sticker, invisible against the black neck feathers, did not react.|$|E
25|$|Thirty-five {{men were}} sent from Ranger to Drake {{to take charge}} and assess the damage; and {{the next three days}} were spent making repairs, while moving slowly north-westward between Ireland and Scotland. A cargo brig which came too close was captured, and used as extra accommodations. On the other hand, six Irish {{fisherman}} who had been captured on the first Carrickfergus expedition were allowed, along with three sick Irish sailors, to take a boat and go home, with a present of sails from Drake, and some money from Jones. On their return they reported the concern Jones was showing for Lieut. Dobbs, who remained gravely ill. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy had sent out some proper warships in pursuit. Despite Drake lameness, they never <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the slowly escaping Americans. The only real trouble Jones had was with his Lieutenant, Thomas Simpson, who had command of the Drake and at one point on the voyage sailed out of sight.|$|E

500|$|The nurse's aide told Sanders {{about her}} {{minister}}, {{who was not}} at the temple that night: [...] "Just wait until you hear my minister talk. He's very disciplined, he's good-looking, and all the sisters want him." [...] Sanders enjoyed the food so much, she agreed to come back and meet the woman's minister. At the second dinner, the nurse's aide told her the minister was present and Sanders thought to herself, [...] "Big deal." [...] In 1992 she recalled how her demeanor changed when she <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> MalcolmX: ...|$|E
500|$|Emerald and Amethyst {{had more}} {{success in the}} spring of 1809 when on 23 March they {{captured}} the brigs Caroline and Serpent. In April, Emerald assisted Amethyst in the chase of a large 44-gun frigate off Ushant. Emerald sighted , with a main battery of 18-pounders and under the command of Captain Dupoter, at 11:00 on 5 April and immediately signalled Amethyst for assistance. Amethyst <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the French forty-four just as she turned away to the south-east and gave chase but by 19:20 had lost sight of both Niemen and Emerald. Amethyst fell in with Niemen again at around 21:30 and engaged her. Niemen was forced to strike when a second British frigate, [...] came into view and fired a broadside. The Royal Navy took Niemen into service under her existing name.|$|E
500|$|Wadsworths {{first summer}} {{overseas}} {{proved to be}} the most eventful period of her wartime service. She sighted her first U-boat on 18May, less than two weeks after she began patrols out of Queenstown. Though the destroyer sped to the attack, the submarine dove and escaped. Three days later, Wadsworth picked up some survivors from [...] which had been torpedoed and sunk the preceding day. On 7June, the destroyer <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> another enemy submarine just before it submerged and escaped. Between 24 and 27June, Wadsworth served as part of the escort for the first American troop convoy to reach Europe. Though she scored no definitely provable successes against German submarines, the destroyer made depth charge attacks on four separate occasions in July and a gunfire attack in one other instance. The first two depth-charge attacks, on 10 and 11July, returned no results whatsoever, and the gun attack on 20July was similarly unrewarding. However, after sighting a double periscope the following day, Wadsworth made another depth-charge attack. During that attack, one of the explosions seemed much stronger than those from the other charges she dropped. Moreover, a patch of reddish-brown material rose to the surface. Although it seemed certain that the destroyer had damaged a submarine, no conclusive evidence was found to prove this possibility.|$|E

60|$|The three Rover boys looked upward. They heard a hasty {{movement}} in the bushes and <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> brief <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man's face. On the instant the man disappeared, muttering something to himself.|$|R
60|$|As he {{dismounted}} at {{the side}} door he <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> fleeting <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gaunt, elderly woman peering at him from behind the curtain of an upper window. Evidently this was his aunt by adoption.|$|R
500|$|An {{enduring}} friendship {{featured in}} EastEnders {{was the one}} shared between the characters Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (played by Gretchen Franklin), first shown on-screen in 1985 and ending with Ethel's death in 2000, though the characters shared a backstory set prior to 1985 and were scripted as neighbours who grew old together in East London, along with Lou Beale (Anna Wing). BBC News has described Dot and Ethel as an [...] "incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious". Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: [...] "Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting on the step of the Vic, waiting for me mother. I <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> her through the door. Sitting {{on top of the}} piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out [...] "Roll Out the Barrel". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel." [...] Critic for The Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith, discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas: [...] "There was always one pretty and pert , and always one in glasses [...]" [...] Banks-Smith adds that theirs was [...] "a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship." ...|$|E

2500|$|But as we stood, {{one of the}} porters behind {{called out}} [...] "Simba"; and we <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> a big lioness {{galloping}} down beside the trees, just beyond the donga … Tarlton took his big double-barrel and advised me to take mine, as the sun had just set and it {{was likely to be}} close work; but I shook my head, for the Winchester 405 is, at least for me personally, the [...] "medicine gun" [...] for lions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I shall {{probably}} never see that child again, yet what a pleasant picture she leaves in my memory!" [...] I thought to myself, as I <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> last <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the brown hat going round the corner.|$|R
60|$|As the Heliumite watched he {{saw another}} green warrior push his way forward toward the rostrum. Beside him he dragged a captive, {{and as the}} {{surrounding}} warriors parted to let the two pass, Carthoris <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> fleeting <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the prisoner.|$|R

2500|$|Zhang {{then went}} off to Mount Putuo, {{one of the four}} Sacred Mountains of China, and was not too far from where he was. One day, a young man walked by and <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the sutra that Zhang was reading. [...] He was named Wang, who also had {{aspirations}} of becoming a monastic. It {{was the first time that}} Zhang had shared with anyone else his desire of becoming a monk. The stranger standing before him soon became his close friend.|$|E
2500|$|The {{legend of}} the wind blowing around the cathedral is as follows: In olden days, the Devil flew over the ground, riding the wind. Thus he <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> his {{portrait}} carved onto the cathedral: the Tempter, courting the foolish virgins (...) , {{in the guise of}} a seductive young man. It is true that his back opens up and toads and snakes come out of it, but none of the naïve girls notices that [...] nor do many tourists for that matter. Very flattered and curious, the Devil had the idea to enter to see whether there were other sculptures representing him on the inside of the cathedral. Taken captive inside the holy place, he could not come back out. The wind always waits in the square and still howls today from impatience on the places outside the cathedral. The Devil, furious, makes air currents from the bottom of the church to the height of the pillar of angels.|$|E
2500|$|On October 5, 1871, Hickok was {{standing}} off a crowd during a street brawl when Coe fired two shots. Hickok {{ordered him to}} be arrested for firing a pistol within the city limits. Coe claimed that he was shooting at a stray dog, and then suddenly turned his gun on Hickok, who fired first and killed Coe. Hickok <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> someone running toward him and quickly fired two more shots in reaction, accidentally shooting and killing Abilene Special Deputy Marshal Mike Williams, who was coming to his aid. This event haunted Hickok {{for the remainder of}} his life. There is another account of the Coe shootout: Theophilus Little, the mayor of Abilene and owner of the town's lumber yard, recorded his time in Abilene by writing in a notebook which was ultimately given to the Abilene Historical Society. Writing in 1911, he detailed his admiration of Hickok and included a paragraph on the shooting that differs considerably from the reported account: ...|$|E

60|$|The {{door opened}} slowly towards them and closed again. It was Mr. Dane who had entered. From outside they <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> {{momentary}} <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> another man, waiting.

60|$|The {{man with}} the shade became aware of my {{presence}} for the first time, and threw his head {{back for a moment}} and sideways, to see me. I <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> momentary <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> his eyes, small and bright and inflamed. Then he began to cough and splutter again.|$|R
2500|$|Kane {{was one of}} the first, if not the first, tourist {{to travel}} across the Canadian west and the Pacific north-west. Through his {{sketches}} and paintings, and later also his book, the public at large in Upper and Lower Canada for the first time <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the peoples and their lifestyles in this vast and barely known territory. Kane had set out with a sincere desire to accurately portray his experiences—the landscape, the people, their tools. Yet it was primarily his embellished studio work that gained public appeal and made him famous. His idealized oil paintings and the similarly transformed travel notes that became his book were both a factor in the establishment and spreading of the perception of the North American indigenous people as noble savages, contrary to what the artist had intended. The more truthful field sketches were [...] "rediscovered" [...] and valued by a wider audience only in the twentieth century.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1947, Kenneth Arnold claimed to have seen some unusual flying objects near Mount Rainier. His report caused {{widespread}} interest in unidentified flying objects, and Palmer was quick {{to argue that the}} [...] "flying saucers" [...] were validation of the Shaver Mystery—for several years, he noted, Shaver had mentioned the Deros' supposed spaceships. The idea that Shaver and Palmer had somehow predicted or pre-staged the [...] "flying saucer" [...] craze was later championed by writer John Keel. His 1983 article [...] "The Man Who Invented Flying Saucers" [...] (first published in Fortean Times) declared that [...] "Palmer assigned artists to make sketches of objects described by readers and disc-shaped flying machines appeared on the covers of his magazine long before June 1947. So we can note that a considerable number of people—millions—were exposed to the flying saucer concept before the national news media were even aware of it. Anyone who glanced at the magazines on a newsstand and <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the saucer-emblazoned Amazing Stories cover had the image implanted in his subconscious".|$|E
2500|$|There, Kekaumenos had {{proceeded}} to rout the imperial Macedonian right, reaching and entering their camp, destroying the tents and killing the imperial generals Maurokatakalos and Katzamountes. This encouraged their own side while sowing doubt {{in the mind}} of Prince Aaron and his men. Isaac Komnenos managed to hold the centre firm long enough for Kekaumenos to join him and press in on Theodore. Here the battle was at its thickest, and Komnenos just managed to avoid being killed when he was attacked by four Russians. [...] Eventually, however, the imperial centre began to give way and the imperial troops began fleeing the field. An important commander of the imperial forces, Radulph the Frank, was caught up in the ensuing rout when he <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> Nikephoros Botaneiates leading an attacking division. Shouting a war cry, Radulph turned around and {{proceeded to}} attack Botaneiates, and the two engaged in single combat until Radulph’s sword broke and he was captured. [...] Theodore and Prince Aaron fled to Constantinople, while Isaac Komnenos advanced to Nicomedia.|$|E
60|$|That evening, at {{the crowded}} corner by the Cafe de la Paix, I <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> {{fleeting}} <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> Laploshka. He smiled, slightly raised his hat, and vanished. I {{never saw him}} again. After all, the money {{had been given to}} the deserving rich, and the soul of Laploshka was at peace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Too {{much for}} me." [...] Martin <b>caught</b> <b>an</b> amusing <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> himself ironing fluffy white things that women wear. But {{he had taken}} a liking to the other, and he added: [...] "I might do the plain washing. I learned that much at sea." [...] Joe Dawson thought visibly for a moment.|$|R
5000|$|The King {{would not}} be seen again by the public until Monday {{afternoon}} when <b>a</b> medium-sized crowd <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> brief <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> him as he went into Holyroodhouse to hear long repetitive addresses from the Church of Scotland, the Scottish Episcopal Church, universities, burghs, counties and the Highland Society, and give his short formal responses.|$|R
2500|$|Speeches {{and lectures}} {{continued}} to be a regular offering on the Tibbits stage. These included such lectures as Wallace Bruce's [...] "Philosophy of Wit and Humor", Charles Hampton's [...] "Hard Times, Their Cause and Cure", and Robert G. Ingersoll's [...] "Liberty of Man, Woman and Child." [...] Capturing the rhetorical might of such lectures, the Weekly Courier described Judge Yaple's lecture [...] "Personality", with the following words: [...] "A flowing crystal of words, here and there sharply broken into prisms of color, through which one <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> crimson sunsets, the majesty of the mountains, the waving flowers of the meadow, the sweetness of the lilies of the valley, the stillness and solemnity of the leafy woods, the songs of birds, the celestial harmony of the starry heavens and the roar and thunder of a thousand Niagaras." [...] A number of political speeches were offered as well by the likes of Gov. Rich, Senator J. C. Burrows, Gov. Shaw of Iowa, and Adeli Stevenson, a Vice Presidential nominee.|$|E
2500|$|Oswald's co-worker, Charles Givens, {{testified to}} the Commission that he last saw Oswald on the 6th floor of the Texas School Book Depository (TSBD) at {{approximately}} 11:55a.m.—35 minutes before the motorcade entered Dealey Plaza. The Commission report stated that Oswald was not seen again [...] "until after the shooting." [...] However, in an FBI report taken {{the day after the}} assassination, Givens said that the encounter took place at 11:30a.m. and that he later saw Oswald reading a newspaper in the first floor domino room at 11:50a.m. William Shelley, a foreman at the depository, also testified that he saw Oswald making a phone call on the first floor between 11:45 and 11:50a.m. Janitor Eddie Piper also testified that he spoke to Oswald on the first floor at 12:00p.m. Another co-worker, Bonnie Ray Williams, was eating his lunch on the sixth floor of the depository and was there until at least 12:10p.m. He said that during that time, he did not see Oswald, or anyone else, on the sixth floor and thought that he was the only person up there. However, he also said that some boxes in the southeast corner may have prevented him from seeing deep into the [...] "sniper's nest." [...] Carolyn Arnold, the secretary to the Vice President of the TSBD, informed the FBI that as she left the building to watch the motorcade, she <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> a man whom she believed to be Oswald standing in the first floor hallway of the building just prior to the assassination.|$|E
2500|$|Ultimately, a {{breakthrough}} in the sessions was achieved. While jamming on a song called [...] "Sick Puppy"—an early version of [...] "Mysterious Ways"—the band tried different chord progressions for the bridge. The jam stopped and the Edge tried playing them alone on an acoustic guitar, as [...] "everyone was trying to decide if they were any good." [...] At the suggestion of producer Daniel Lanois, the Edge played two separate sections sequentially. The band liked the way it flowed and decided to try and play it together. Speaking of the improvisation, the Edge said, [...] "suddenly something very powerful [...] happening in the room." [...] He added, [...] "Everyone recognized {{it was a special}} piece. It was like we'd <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> what the song could be." [...] Soon afterwards, the band had developed the piece of music into [...] "One". [...] Bono recalls that [...] "the melody, the structure—the whole thing was done in 15 minutes". [...] He also stated that the lyrics [...] "just fell out of the sky, a gift"; the concept was inspired by the band members' fracturing relationships, the German reunification, and Bono's scepticism of the hippie idea of [...] "oneness". Bono later sent a note to the Dalai Lama declining an invitation to a festival called Oneness, incorporating a line from the song: [...] "One—but not the same". [...] The song's writing inspired the band and changed their outlook on the recording sessions. Mullen Jr. said the song reaffirmed the band's [...] "blank page approach" [...] to recording and reassured the band that all was not lost.|$|E
5000|$|On 13 May 1741 at 9:00am, the {{carpenter}} went forward {{to inspect the}} chain plates. Whilst there he thought he <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> fleeting <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> land to the west. Lieutenant Baynes was also there but he saw nothing, and the sighting was not reported. Consequently, no one realised that Wager had entered a large, uncharted bay.|$|R
60|$|After {{that neither}} of them moved for half a minute during which the deck slanted wildly beneath them, and then Frank {{proceeded}} very reluctantly toward the table.

60|$|In {{the rapid}} {{fighting}} that followed I had little chance to note aught else than {{the movements of}} my immediate adversaries, but now and again I <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> fleeting <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> purring sword and a lightly springing figure of sinewy steel that filled my heart with a strange yearning and a mighty but unaccountable pride.|$|R
