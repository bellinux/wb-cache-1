40|$|We {{put forward}} a {{modified}} Zipper model inspired by the statics and dynamics of the spontaneous reconstitution of rodlike tobacco mosaic virus particles in solutions containing the coat protein and the single-stranded RNA of the virus.

The subsequent addition and conformational switching of coat proteins to the growing capsid we believe is catalyzed {{by the presence of}} the helical arrangement of bound proteins to the RNA. The model explains why the formation of <b>complete</b> <b>viruses</b> is favored over incomplete ones, even though the process is quasi-one-dimensional in character. We numerically solve the relevant kinetic equations and show that time evolution is different for the assembly and disassembly of the virus, the former exhibiting a time lag even if all forward rate constants are equal.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} why identifiable reassortants between subgroup 1 and subgroup 2 rotaviruses have been so rarely isolated from human specimens. Cultured cells were coinfected with pairs of subgroup 1 and 2 human rotaviruses and passaged multiple times to simulate natural reassortant formation and selection in vivo. After coinfection of MA- 104 cells with subgroup 1 (DS- 1) and subgroup 2 (either Wa or P) strains, approximately 14 ~ of the plaque-picked progeny were shown to be reassortants. During multiple passages of these coinfected cultures, however, <b>complete</b> (Wa <b>virus</b> coinfection) or nearly <b>complete</b> (P <b>virus</b> coinfection) loss of detectable DS- 1 segments from progeny was observed. Thus, when all segments of the subgroup 2 viruses were present in coinfected cultures, these segments dominated in the selected progeny. Coinfection with subgroup 1 -subgroup 2 rotavirus reassortants and the DS- 1 strain followed by multiple passages, however, resulted in complete loss of some segments from the subgroup 2 strains originally present in the reassortants. Therefore, segments from the parental subgroup 2 viruses appeared to be selected in toto during multiple passages because th y were dominant as a group, not because individual segments of these viruses were consistently favoured over their subgroup 1 virus counterparts...|$|R
40|$|A {{correlation}} of cytochemical changes with virus production {{has been studied}} in L cells infected with Mcngnvirus. After a latent period of about 2 hours, virus was produced rapidly, reaching maximum titers of up to 12, 000 particles pcr ccll in 6 to 8 hours. The earlicst cytological change was in the nucleus and consisted of a slight condensation of chromatin. There is no evidcncc, howcvcr, for the multiplication of either the viral RNA or protcin in the nuclcus. RNA, of high molecular wcight, accumulated in the perinuclcar area of the cytoplasm and was later found in inclusions.

The ultrasonic absorption by the core particle was quite large compared with the absorption by other nucleoprotein assemblies, suggesting that the core contains some organized structure. Both the core and the <b>complete</b> <b>virus</b> absorbed ultrasound more than did the capsidless subparticle. The difference spectrum for the virion relative to the capsidless subparticle may represent a single relaxation and is analyzed, by using a recent model, {{in terms of volume}} fluctuations due to radial movements in the virion.

40|$|Flaviviruses bud {{into the}} {{endoplasmic}} reticulum and are transported through the secretory pathway, where the mildly acidic environment triggers particle rearrangement and allows furin processing of the prM protein to pr and M. The peripheral pr peptide remains bound to virus at low pH and inhibits virus-membrane interaction. Upon exocytosis, {{the release of}} pr at neutral pH <b>completes</b> <b>virus</b> maturation to an infectious particle. Together this evidence suggests that pr may shield the flavivirus fusion protein E from the low pH environment of the exocytic pathway. Here we developed an in vitro system to reconstitute the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) pr with soluble truncated E proteins. At low pH recombinant pr bound to both monomeric and dimeric forms of E and blocked their membrane insertion. Exogenous pr interacted with mature infectious DENV and specifically inhibited virus fusion and infection. Alanine substitution of E H 244, a highly conserved histidine residue in the pr-E interface, blocked pr-E interaction and reduced release of DENV virus-like particles. Folding, membrane insertion and trimerization of the H 244 A mutant E protein were preserved, and particle release could be partially rescued by neutralization of the low pH of the secretory pathway. Thus, pr acts to silence flavivirus fusion activity during virus secretion, and this function can {{be separated from the}} chaperone activity of prM. The sequence conservation of key residues involved in the flavivirus pr-E interaction suggests that this protein-protein interface may be a useful target for broad-spectrum inhibitors...|$|R
