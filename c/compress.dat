It is a natural way for representing very highly <b>compressed</b> images, by describing larger parts in terms of smaller (earlier described) ones. For 1 -dimensional strings there exist polynomial-time deterministic algorithms for similar types of compression [2, 6, 8, 9].

These characteristics and abilities led Lahiri to classify him as belonging to the pantheon of short-story geniuses that include O. Henry, Frank O'Connor and Flannery O'Connor.

5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to <b>compress</b> the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E
5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an optic glioma, may also impact the optic nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may <b>compress</b> the optic tracts or the optic chiasm of the optic nerve (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. What kind of {{operations}} can we perform effectively (without full unpacking) with <b>compressed</b> texts? In this paper we consider three fundamental problems: (1) check {{the equality of}} two <b>compressed</b> texts, (2) check whether one <b>compressed</b> text is a substring of another <b>compressed</b> text, and (3) compute the number of different symbols (Hamming distance) between two <b>compressed</b> texts of the same length. We present an algorithm that solves the first problem in O(n 3) time and the second problem in O(n 2 m) time. Here n {{is the size of}} <b>compressed</b> representation (we consider representations by straight-line programs) of the text and m is the size of <b>compressed</b> representation of the pattern. Next, we prove that the third problem is actually #P-complete. Thus, we indicate a pair of similar problems (equivalence checking, Hamming distance computation) that have radically different complexity on <b>compressed</b> texts. Our algorithmic technique used for problems (1) and (2) helps for computing minimal periods and covers of <b>compressed</b> texts. ...|$|R

When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can <b>compress</b> the heart and adversely affect the function of the heart.

5|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{has been}} a leader in laser-driven {{inertial}} confinement fusion (ICF) since the initial concept was developed by LLNL employee John Nuckols in the late 1950s. The basic idea was to use a driver to <b>compress</b> a small pellet known as the target that contains the fusion fuel, a mix of deuterium (D) and tritium (T). If the compression reaches high enough values, fusion reactions begin to take place, releasing alpha particles and neutrons. The alphas may impact atoms in the surrounding fuel, heating them {{to the point where they}} undergo fusion as well. If the rate of alpha heating is higher than heat losses to the environment, the result is a self-sustaining chain reaction known as ignition.|$|E
