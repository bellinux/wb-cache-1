Thanks to a simpler <b>construction,</b> <b>weight</b> dropped considerably: from 610 kg for the old T360 to 500 kg for the 1967 TN360. Output remained unchanged at 30 PS (22 kW) at 8,000 rpm, but torque increased somewhat to 3.0 kgm Nm at 5,500 rpm and everything occurred in a lower engine speed range. The engine benefited from engineering efforts achieved on the Honda 1300 four cylinder, air-cooled sedan introduced in 1969. The TN also had a considerably tighter turning circle, at 7.6 metres. The only bodywork available was as a drop-side pickup truck.|$|E

The surprisingly strong rise in prices for steel has sharpened the situation. Of course the most economical solutions have to be developed. Nevertheless, these structures have to fulfil all necessary technical requirements including structural stability. The existing experiences mainly refer to Monopile structures until now. With regard to construction, production and assembly this simple shell structure has great advantages over filigree latticed structures. These advantages are paid for with a larger amount of material. On the other hand the unit price per tonne of steel weight is comparatively low. This paper introduces some fundamental, qualitative considerations for the question to the optimal support structure. Applying particular design tools which have been developed {{in the frame of}} recent research projects a parameter study on a pre-design level for different power rates and a location in the North Sea is carried out.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{ultraviolet}} {{properties of}} textiles dyed with synthetic dyes {{have been widely}} reported in literature. However, no study has investigated the ultraviolet properties of natural fabrics dyed with natural colorants. This study reports the Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) of cotton fabrics dyed with colorants of plant and insect origins. Methods Three cotton fabrics were dyed with three natural colorants. Fabrics were characterized with respect to fabric <b>construction,</b> <b>weight,</b> thickness and thread count. Influence of fabric characteristics on Ultraviolet Protection Factor was studied. Role of colorant concentration on the ultraviolet protection factor was examined via color strength analysis. Results A positive correlation was observed between {{the weight of the}} fabric and their UPF values. Similarly, thicker fabrics offered more protection from ultraviolet rays. Thread count appears to negatively correlate with UPF. Dyeing with natural colorants dramatically increased the protective abilities of all three fabric constructions. Additionally, within the same fabric type UPF values increased with higher depths of shade. Conclusion Dyeing cotton fabrics with natural colorants increases the ultraviolet protective abilities of the fabrics and can be considered as an effective protection against ultraviolet rays. The UPF is further enhanced with colorant of dark hues and with high concentration of the colorant in the fabric. </p...|$|E

Current aircraft carrier displacement limits are {{based primarily on}} structural strength criteria under very limited load and environment conditions. Traditional methods of determining hull girder displacement strength utilized an arbitrary safety factor of 15 percent which was allowed between the Calculated Primary Stress and the Design Primary Stress. The use of this safety factor and others {{has resulted in the}} establishment of a conservative displacement limit. This established displacement limit fails to provide an adequate margin of comfort for the addition of post <b>construction</b> <b>weight</b> to aircraft carrier hulls and does not provide an accurate indication of the actual hull girder displacement limit. A first failure analysis of fifteen sections of the newest aircraft carrier design (CVN 77) was conducted. The results of this analysis along with output data from the Ship Hull Characteristic Program (SHCP) were utilized in forming an alternate method for determining the limiting displacement for strength for aircraft carriers. Although the present aircraft carrier displacement limit takes into account numerous other limitations, this process deals only with the hull girder displacement limit for strength. This study does not provide a specific number for the displacement limit for strength for aircraft carriers; however, it does show that the NIMITZ aircraft carrier hull is potentially capable of sustaining significant additional weight without exceeding established Maximum Allowable Bending Moment limits.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the European HAPTEX project (HAPtic sensing of virtual TEXtiles) is to develop and {{validate}} a novel global method of creating multimodal interacting environments, including haptic, tactile and visual rendering. The example chosen for this development work is “Multimodal perception of textiles in the virtual environment”. The aim of the project {{is to create a}} virtual textile that a person can perceive, touch and manipulate. The multimodal interaction consists of visual representation of the cloth simulation and haptic and tactile interface which are integrated and the user is allowed to sense and identify the typical properties of different kinds of fabrics. In order to present different types of textiles in the virtual system, data of the mechanical properties of the fabrics is required. The KES-F (Kawabata) system offers a sensitive measurement method for the determination of bending, compression, tensile, shear, surface roughness and friction properties. Some modifications to the standard tests were required, in order to provide appropriate input for the simulation of the fabrics. All properties are needed for the haptic/tactile rendering, whereas the tensile, shear and bending properties are used for the visual rendering. Altogether 54 different fabrics were chosen for the tests. The first set of 20 fabrics were very different in their structure (raw materials, <b>construction,</b> <b>weight</b> and thickness), in order to define the range of variability. The second set was focused on men’s woven suit fabrics and elastic knitted fabrics. And the third set was focused on warp knitted fabrics for car seat covers. The measured mechanical properties will be validated with subjective assessments in the validation phase of the project. ...|$|E
40|$|This work aims at {{identifying}} and proposing four prefabricated exterior wall elements {{to a company}} that will build small prefabricated houses where the house elements are produced in a Micro factory. The four wall elements are as follows: Corner wall units, wall elements with no cut-out for windows and doors, wall elements with cut-out for a window and door and wall elements with cut-out for a door. In this report four different prefabricated outer wall elements have been proposed for small housing project. A comparison study has been made between three different wall solutions (Outer wall solution two has been proposed by the students themselves as well as outer wall solution one and three from two different building suppliers, Isover and Paroc.) to ensure which of these walls fits the best for the four prefabrication element drawings. The main difference between the walls solutions mentioned above is that outer wall solution two has one thick layer of insulation with light beam rails and outer wall solution one and three has massive tree beams in them with separated insulation layers. The advantage of light rails compared to massive rails in outer walls is that the thermal bridges are minimized {{due to the fact}} that there are not as much exposed joints in the outer wall with light rails. One more big difference is that the U-value's differ between the three outer-wall solutions. Since the materials are different in the three outer-walls the sound insulation and fire protection characteristics also differ. The sound insulation and fire protection ability depends mainly on the amount of plaster boards and type of insulation in the wall. Outer wall solution two has been chosen for the house project and it will be the head characteristic wall ahead in this report. Outer wall Option Two) was chosen for the project. It was chosen due to following criteria's: low energy needs for active heating, low manufacturing costs, low U-value, low <b>construction</b> <b>weight,</b> good moist resistance, good sound reduction and high fire protection class...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Contractors {{and clients}} in the {{construction}} industry are increasingly interested in possibilities to reduce CO 2 emissions and energy consumption. In the civil engineering industry most CO 2 emissions are due to the production of construction materials and construction of a structure. The research focuses on the differences between insitu and prefab concrete construction and {{whether or not there is}} a significant difference in energy consumption and CO 2 emission between the two construction processes. The research will cover the entire production and construction process; from the winning of the primary material to the delivery of the structure. Quick scan tool To determine and quantify the differences between the two construction methods a tool is developed, called the quick scan tool (QST). This tool is focussed on the construction of a viaduct. The QST defines four elements in a viaduct: Deck/beams, columns, abutments and foundation. There are 5 construction methods defined to nuance the results of the tool. From insitu construction in its most basic form, to fully automated produced prefab elements. With the definition of each construction method, calculation values are appointed. Emissions factors are gathered from multiple sources. The production and construction process is divided in four phases of emissions: Material, transport, factory and onsite. Results The QST shows that reductions in CO 2 emissions and energy consumption are possible when constructing with prefab. The reductions originate from three sources. 1) Prefab structures are constructed with high strength concrete (C 53 /C 65), therefore less construction material is required. Due to the reduction of construction material less CO 2 is emitted. 2) The process of prefab construction is more efficient than insitu. Especially the emissions onsite are reduced, because less equipment is required onsite and project time is shorter. The emissions due to transport, will in general, be higher. 3) A prefab deck is constructed with box beams, this results in less force on other load bearing elements and reduces their size. All comparisons in the research are made to “the worst case scenario”, a predefined case which is an insitu concrete structure, constructed with the least environmental friendly electricity. With prefab concrete construction a total reduction of 23 % can be obtained in comparison to “the worst-case scenario”. Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis shows there are a number of possibilities to reduce the energy consumption and CO 2 emission of a project. Reducing <b>construction</b> <b>weight</b> and reducing construction material have the most significant influence on the emissions of a project. The implementation of green electricity in factories and onsite is one of the easiest ways to reduce CO 2 emissions, especially combined with the implementation of (electrical) tower cranes. Especially with prefab construction optimizing transport routes is beneficial. Other CO 2 reducing measures, like carpooling or hybrid cars have less effect on the CO 2 emission of a project. The influence of each of these measures on the energy consumption and CO 2 emission of a project depends on the type of construction method which is researched. Discussion The results of the tool should be put in the right perspective, due to considerable differences in calculation values and emission factors found in literature. These differences originate from differences in; scope, used data and assumptions. Due to the great array of data used by research institutes the data is difficult to assess. Future Construction companies have a number of tools at their dispense to reduce CO 2 emissions in construction industry. Constructing light, reducing the quantity of construction material and utilizing the more efficient process of prefab construction are the most important. Other more well-known options like using green electricity and carpooling have less impact. To which extend construction companies are going to implement these measures depends on how the matter is incorporated in tenders. Governments have two possibilities to reduce CO 2 emissions on a project level. A maximum CO 2 emission can be defined or companies could get reimbursed by reducing CO 2 emissions. The willingness of the government to tackle environmental problems is important in this matter. Design and Construction ProcessesCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
