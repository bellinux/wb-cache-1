5|$|The Silver Jubilee Bridge was widened in {{the mid-1970s}} by bolting a new {{pedestrian}} way {{to the side of}} the original structure and widening the roadways over the old footpaths.

5|$|Arriving in Thunderbird 2, Virgil deploys three Elevator Cars, two {{of which}} will be {{remote-controlled}} from his master vehicle.
