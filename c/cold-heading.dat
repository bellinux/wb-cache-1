50|$|Injection molding of Delrin {{provides}} {{freedom of}} styling to zipper manufacturers. It {{allows them to}} produce appealing geometric shapes which are otherwise not possible with metals {{and other kinds of}} plastic. Almost all the innovative techniques like snap/press fitting, self-threading screws, ultrasonic welding, riveting, and <b>cold-heading</b> can be effortlessly performed with this plastic. The zippers can also be colored, metallized, painted or printed after they are moulded. The overall success of the Delrin zipper depends on to a large extent on its quality, design and cost-effectiveness. The moulding process also adds some UV resistant polymers to these zippers which enable them to withstand UV degradation effectively.|$|E
5000|$|Rimmed steel, {{also known}} as drawing quality steel, has little to no {{deoxidizing}} agent added to it during casting which causes carbon monoxide to evolve rapidly from the ingot. This causes small blow holes in the surface that are later closed up in the hot rolling process. Another result is the segregation of elements; {{almost all of the}} carbon, phosphorus, and sulfur move {{to the center of the}} ingot, leaving an almost perfect [...] "rim" [...] of pure iron on the outside of the ingot. This gives the ingot an excellent surface finish because of this iron rim, but also form the most segregated composition. Most rimmed steel has a carbon content below 0.25% carbon, a manganese content below 0.6%, and is not alloyed with aluminum, silicon, and titanium. This type of steel is commonly used for cold-bending, cold-forming, <b>cold-heading</b> and, as the name implies, drawing. Due to the non-uniformity of alloying elements it is not recommended for hot-working applications.|$|E
40|$|Cryopreservation is {{the set of}} {{practices}} applied to bring cells to cryogenic temperatures without producing injuries. In fact, the obsolescence of cells is caused by chemical reactions, and {{the rate at which}} these reactions occur can be drastically reduced by lowering the temperature. The lower the storage temperature, the longer cells can be kept. For instance, at temperatures of - 80 °C (dry ice) cells can be preserved for months, even if some chemical reactions can occur, while temperatures of - 196 °C (liquid nitrogen) can guarantee indefinite storage. Nowadays the freezing of cells is carried out through programmable freezers: this kind of machines use liquid nitrogen to reach the storage temperature. However, the use of liquid nitrogen is a limiting factor in many situations of inefficient or absent nitrogen distribution network, such as small industries, isolated places and during transport of cells. Since the early 1950 s, many studies have been carried out on the possibility to reduce injuries to cells subjected to freezing. No analytical approach has emerged, but an “unwritten rule” states the optimal range for cooling velocity between 0, 1 °C/min and 10 °C/min [1]. The characteristic curve (temperature on the <b>cold-head</b> vs time) of a Pulse Tube refrigerator observed during experimental analysis has shown that the close cycle cryorefrigerator can be used for cell preservation, if equipped with a control system for the cooling rate. Almost all the machines employed in the field of freezing cells use liquid nitrogen. The interest in the Pulse Tube refrigerator is due to a reduced need of continuous maintenance for adding technical gas. Even the absence of magnetic field and the reduction of vibrations near the <b>cold-head</b> make this kind of refrigerator suitable for the cryopreservation of cells. The mathematical approach theorized aims at regulating the <b>cold-head</b> temperature through the prevision of electric power to be dissipated in a passive component, allowing to obtain a freezing curve induced by the PT, coincident with the one established by the molecular theory. A resistor linked with a power amp was used to produce heat for Joule effect to control the cooling rate. The dissipated power was handled by a software realized with LabView™ that monitors temperature both of the <b>cold-head</b> and of the test tube containing the cells. The results obtained theoretically have then been compared with experimental data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{experimental study}} on GM-type pulse tube refrigerator (PTR). In a PTR, the pulse tube is only filled with working gas and there exists secondary flow {{due to a}} large temperature difference between cold-end and warm-end. The stability of secondary flow is affected by orientation of <b>cold-head</b> and thus, the cooling performance is deteriorated by gas mixing due to secondary flow. In this study, a single stage GM-type pulse tube refrigerator is fabricated and tested. The cooing performance of the fabricated PTR is measured as varying <b>cold-head</b> orientation angle {{and the results are}} used as reference data. Then, we divided interior space of pulse tube into three segments, and fixed the various size of screen mesh at interface of each segment to suppress the performance degradation due to secondary flow. For various configuration of pulse tube, no-load test and heat load test are carried out with the fixed experimental condition of charging pressure, operating frequency and orifice valve turns. From experimental results, the fine screen mesh shows the effective suppression of performance degradation for the large orientation angle, but the use of screen mesh cause the loss of cooling capacity rather than the case of no insertion into pulse tube. It should be compromised whether the use of screen mesh in consideration of the installation limitation of a GM-type pulse tube refrigerator...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind this}} study is the lack of specialized analysis regarding internal failure caused by the adiabatic shear hand (ASB) phenomenon in the cold-headed products. Its aim was to present an integrated workability study to improve and assist <b>cold-heading</b> (CH) multistage design procedures to replace the current design rules of thumb, as they are neither effective nor adequate in fulfilling the needs of the new developments in the rapidly expanding CH industry. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive testing methodology and FE modeling, implemented within ABAQUS/Explicit, were established. This methodology includes an instrumented Drop Weight Compression Test (DWCT) tower equipped with a guided pocket die-set configuration capable of developing internal failure at different stages of ASBs and integrated metallographic inspection techniques. A validated FE model of the DWCT and guided pocket die-set configuration was a valuable tool in establishing the failure criteria and indicating the workability limits. A detailed experimental and FE study for the ASB stages in the CH process was introduced to uncover the affect of different parameters controlling the failure mechanisms within the ASBs in the CH process. This study investigated the effect of the thermal, geometric and the material flow softening and hardening mechanisms affecting ASB evolution. Moreover, a detailed metallurgical and FE study of the internal ductile and Transformed Adiabatic Shear Band (TASB) failures caused by the ASB phenomenon in DWCT was conducted. Three ductile failure criteria were introduced to predict the initiation and location of the internal ductile failure in the ASBs. One TASB failure criteria was introduced to predict the phase transformation to undesirable brittle martensite. These failure criteria were employed to establish integrated workability methodologies to indicate the objective workability limits. Applying these workability methodologies on multistage CH FE models showed that these methodologies are an efficient tool to predict the damage levels and failure initiation locations within the cold-headed bolts. Moreover, these methodologies were successful in optimizing the die designs in order to reduce damage levels...|$|E

In this system, we introduced a vibration-reduction system, which consist of a firm support for the cold head and a rigid cold table thermally linked to the cold stage, to reduce both vibrations of the overall cold head and the cold stage.

The CT(# 043) has design sensitivity of 1 nGal (1 × 10 ^(- 11) m/s^ 2) to study the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s dynamics in tidal and longer-period bands. A new type of diaphragm was used to effectively isolate the vibration from the refrigerator <b>cold-head</b> and to prevent solid air contamination from entering the Dewar.

40|$|A Cryotiger® gas-mixture cooler {{was applied}} for cooling of three high-Tc SQUID magnetometers. These SQUID magnetometers were mounted on an alumina holder in an axial {{gradiometer}} configuration. From 20 Hz upward, the system noise was about 0. 1 pT/√Hz. Below this frequency, the noise gradually increased {{to a level of}} 10 pT/√Hz at 1 Hz. This low-frequency excess noise appeared to be due to remnant magnetization of the Cryotiger cold head. Movement of magnetic <b>cold-head</b> parts with respect to the SQUIDs are induced by pressure fluctuations in the heat exchanger lines. By using one SQUID as a reference for the cooler noise, a first-order gradiometer can be formed in which the cooler noise is eliminated. To establish a proper second-order gradiometer either a fourth SQUID has to be added, or the spatial separation between cold head and SQUIDs has to be increased significantly...|$|R
40|$|Pulse tube {{refrigerators}} {{are becoming}} more common, because they are cost efficient and demand less handling than conventional (wet) refrigerators. However, a downside of a pulse tube system is the vibration level at the <b>cold-head,</b> which is in most designs several micrometers. We implemented vibration isolation techniques which significantly reduced vibration levels at the experiment. These optimizations were necessary for the vibration sensitive Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy experiments (MRFM) at milli-kelvin temperatures for which the cryostat is intended. With these modifications we show atomic resolution STM on graphite. This is promising for scanning probe microscopy applications at very low temperatures.

40|$|Condensation fronts in protoplanetary disks, where {{abundant}} volatiles deplete {{out of the}} {{gas phase}} and are incorporated into solids, {{are believed to have}} {{played a critical role in}} the formation of planets in the Solar System (1, 2), and similar “snow lines ” in the disks around young stars should affect the ongoing formation of exoplanets. Snow lines can en-hance particle growth and thus planet formation efficiencies because of (i) substantial increases in solid mass surface densities exterior to snow line locations, (ii) continuous freeze-out of gas diffusing across the snow line (<b>cold-head</b> effect), (iii) pile-up of dust just inside of the snow line in pressure traps, and (iv) an increased stickiness of icy grains compared to bare ones, which favors dust coagulation (3 – 7). Experiments and theory on these processes have been focused on the H 2 O snow line, but the results should be generally applicable to snow lines of abundant vola-tiles, with the exception that the “stickiness ” of different icy grain man-tles varies.

40|$|We {{present the}} design and the first light results for the new dual band {{receiver}} (4 mm and 3 mm bands) for Onsala Observatory 20 m antenna. For single dish operation, the receiver uses innovative on-source/off-source optical switch. Within the same optical layout, the switch, in combination with additional optical components, provides 2 calibration loads and sideband measurements possibilities. The optics layout of the receiver uses offset elliptical cold mirrors for both channels whereas the on-off switch employs flat mirrors only. The 3 mm channel employs 2 SB dual polarization receiver with OMT, 4 - 8 GHz IF, x 2 pol x (USB+LSB). The cryostat has 4 optical widows made of HDPE with anti-reflection corrugations, two for the signal and two for each frequency band cold load. The cryostat employs a two stage cryocooler RDK 408 D 2 and uses anti-vibration suspension of the <b>cold-head</b> to minimize impact of the vibrations on the receiver stability.

40|$|A new {{receiver}} for the Onsala 20 m antenna {{with the}} possibility of being equipped with 3 mm and 4 mm bands has been built and the 3 mm channel has been commissioned during the Spring 2014. For single-dish operation, the receiver uses an innovative on-source/off-source optical switch. In combination with additional optical components and within the same optical layout, the switch provides two calibration loads (for the 3 mm and 4 mm channels), sideband rejection measurement, and tuning possibilities. The optical layout of the receiver employs all cold (4 K) offset elliptical mirrors for both channels, whereas the on-off switch employs flat mirrors only. The 3 mm channel employs a sideband separation (2 SB) dual polarization receiver with orthomode transducer (OMT), 4 - 8 GHz intermediate frequency (IF), x? 2 pol x? upper and lower sidebands (USB? +? LSB). The cryostat has four optical windows made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) with anti-reflection corrugations, two for the signal and two for each frequency band cold load.
