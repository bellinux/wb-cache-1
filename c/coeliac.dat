5|$|Some {{evidence}} links epilepsy and <b>coeliac</b> {{disease and}} non-celiac gluten sensitivity, while other evidence does not. There {{appears to be}} a specific syndrome which includes <b>coeliac</b> disease, epilepsy and calcifications in the brain. A 2012 review estimates that between 1% and 6% of people with epilepsy have CD while 1% of the general population has the condition.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} <b>coeliac</b> disease or non-celiac gluten {{sensitivity}} and occipital calcifications, a gluten-free diet may decrease {{the frequency of}} seizures.|$|E
5|$|Other {{potential}} {{causes of}} {{signs and symptoms}} that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis {{that need to be}} ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, <b>coeliac</b> disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered. The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).|$|E
50|$|Along with gliadin (the prolamin gluten {{found in}} wheat), hordein {{is present in}} many foods and also {{may be found in}} beer. Hordein is usually the main problem for <b>coeliacs</b> wishing to drink beer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coeliacs</b> {{are able}} to find {{specialist}} breads that are low in hordein, gliadin and other problematic glycoproteins, just as they can find gluten free beer which either uses ingredients that do not contain gluten, or otherwise has the amounts of gliadin or hordein present controlled to stated limits.|$|R

5|$|The {{suspensory}} muscle of duodenum {{is a thin}} muscle {{connecting the}} junction between the duodenum, jejunum, and duodenojejunal flexure to connective tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric artery and <b>coeliac</b> artery. It {{is also known as}} the ligament of Treitz. The suspensory muscle most often connects to both the third and fourth parts of the duodenum, as well as the duodenojejunal flexure, although the attachment is quite variable.|$|E
5|$|According to some authors, {{who use the}} {{original}} description by Treitz, the muscle may {{be divided into two}} sections: a ligamentous portion attaching the right crus of diaphragm to the connective tissue surrounding the <b>coeliac</b> artery and superior mesenteric artery; and a lower muscular portion from the connective tissue attaching to the duodenum. The superior portion is also described as the Hilfsmuskel. These two parts are now considered anatomically distinct, with the suspensory muscle referring solely to the lower structure attaching at the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} of {{inflammatory}} bowel disease and <b>Coeliac</b> disease found that anti-tTG was increased in inflammatory bowel disease although most cases were not clinical CD. IBD was increased 10 fold in <b>coeliac</b> disease. Inflammatory bowel disease consists of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis.|$|E
40|$|Increasingly {{the number}} of {{individuals}} being diagnosed with some form of sensitivity to the proteins in wheat grains represents a cause for concern. Currently, the treatment is dietary withdrawal of gluten, but commercial gluten-free bread presents some undesirable properties. The objective of this study has been to assess the ability of the enzyme caricain (from papaya latex) to detoxify gliadin in whole wheat flour and develop bread suitable for <b>coeliacs</b> and gluten intolerant individuals. Ion exchange chromatography was used to enrich the caricain in papaya latex and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test kit was used for the analysis of gliadin residues in the baked bread. The partially purified enzyme was found to be more effective in reducing gliadin content than the crude papain and the resultant loaves had acceptable crumb and crust characteristics. Caricain appears to be capable of detoxifying gliadin and has the potential to mitigate the problems confronting <b>coeliacs...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{subset of}} people with {{idiopathic}} neuropathies have only anti-gliadin antibodies {{but none of the}} other enteropathic criteria. About 1/3 have no DQ2 or DQ8 and an apparent abundance of HLA-DQ1. One percent of <b>coeliacs</b> in Europe have no DQ2 and DQ8 but have DQ1. The DQ1 serotype is very common in the normal population, over 65% of Americans have one copy, therefore the linkage is speculative.|$|R

25|$|Squamous {{carcinoma}} of the esophagus is more prevalent in <b>coeliac</b> disease. The increased prevalence may be secondary to GERD that results from chronic delayed gastric emptying.

25|$|In genetically {{susceptible}} people, gluten – a {{major part}} of wheat protein – can trigger <b>coeliac</b> disease. <b>Coeliac</b> disease affects about 1% of the general population in developed countries. There is evidence that most cases remain undiagnosed and untreated. The only known effective treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet.|$|E

25|$|Triticeae {{glutelins}} {{presented by}} DQ2 is some <b>coeliacs.</b> In wheat, the {{low molecular weight}} glutenins often share structural similarity with the prolamins of the similar species of Triticeae.

25|$|In recent years, {{buckwheat}} {{has been}} used as a substitute for other grains in gluten-free beer. Although it is not an actual cereal (being a pseudocereal), buckwheat can be used in the same way as barley to produce a malt that can form the basis of a mash that will brew a beer without gliadin or hordein (together gluten) and therefore can be suitable for <b>coeliacs</b> or others sensitive to certain glycoproteins.|$|R

50|$|Dietitian input is {{generally}} requested {{to ensure the}} person is aware which foods contain gluten, which foods are safe, and {{how to have a}} balanced diet despite the limitations. In many countries, gluten-free products are available on prescription and may be reimbursed by health insurance plans. Gluten-free products are usually more expensive and harder to find than common gluten-containing foods. Since ready-made products often contain traces of gluten, some <b>coeliacs</b> may find it necessary to cook from scratch.|$|R
50|$|Individuals {{who suffer}} from gluten-sensitive enteropathy/coeliac disease have an adverse {{reaction}} to the gluten in cultivars of Triticeae when eaten. In addition to bread wheat, rye and barley (which have similar glutens) are known to cause symptoms in <b>coeliacs.</b> Between 2 and 10% of gluten sensitive individuals are also sensitive to oats, {{but it is not}} clear how much of this is due to contamination of triticeae seeds in oats or allergic responses (versus intolerance). Therefore, when broadly applied the designation of gluten-free applies to foods bearing the seed storage proteins derived from Triticeae.|$|R
40|$|Reliability of {{differential}} sugar absorption tests is hampered {{by a lack}} of standardization of the content and osmolarity of the test solutions. We evaluated the effect of osmolarity of the test solution of the sugar absorption test on the 5 hour urine excretion of orally administered lactulose and mannitol. A group of 28 controls and 14 <b>coeliacs,</b> with villous atrophy grade II to IV, ingested a hyperosmolar sugar absorption test solution and a "low"-osmolar solution, respectively. After an overnight fast, each subject ingested hyperosmolar sugar absorption test solution (2 g mannitol, 5 g lactulose and 40 g sucrose/ 100 ml (around 1, 560 mmol/l)). After two days, this procedure was repeated with low-osmolar solution (2 g mannitol and 5 g lactulose/ 100 ml (around 375 mmol/l). The influence of the sequence of the tests on the results had previously been excluded. All urine from the 5 h-period following ingestion of the test solution was collected. To calculate the low-osmolar solution ratio, samples were analysed for lactulose and mannitol concentrations by gas chromatography The sensitivity of hyperosmolar SAT solution and low-osmolar solution for the detection of mucosal abnormalities in <b>coeliacs</b> was 64 % and 43 %, respectively. In conclusion, a hyperosmolar solution discriminates better between normal and damaged mucosa of the small bowel such as villous atrophy due to a relative increase in permeability for lactulos...|$|R

25|$|Genetic studies {{indicate}} that <b>coeliac</b> disease genetically links to loci shared by linkage with other autoimmune diseases. These linkages may be coincidental with how symptomatic disease is selected from a largely asymptomatic population.|$|E
2500|$|Gluten bears {{an innate}} {{response}} peptide (IRP) found on α-9 gliadin, at positions 31-43 and on α-3, 4, 5, 8, and 11 gliadins. The IRP lies within a 25 amino-acid long region that is resistant to pancreatic proteases. The 25mer is also resistant to Brush border membrane peptidases {{of the small}} intestine in <b>coeliacs.</b> IRP induced the rapid expression of interleukin 15 (IL15) and other factors. Thus IRP activates the immune system. [...] Studies show that, while in normal individuals the peptide is trimmed over time to produce inactive peptide, in celiacs a 19mer may lose a residue from one end or the other, after prolonged incubation that 50% remains intact.|$|R
50|$|DQ2.2 {{does not}} produce all the {{necessary}} subunits to efficiently present the most pathogenic gluten proteins to the immune system.With the DQ2.2 isoform (DQ α2-β2), polar substitutions (amino acids such as asparagine, glutamine, glycine, serine, and threonine) are not bound well to DQ2.2. The gliadin peptides that bind DQ2.5 are enriched in the amino acid glutamine. Since the β2 provides half the structural information for gluten presentation, other haplotypes might provide the rest. Such haplotypes are known to exist and these haplotypes confer different risk on DQ2.2. DQ2.2 however can present less pathogenic epitopes such as proteolytic peptides of gamma-gliadin. This {{appears to be the}} mediator of disease in 1% of <b>coeliacs</b> that are homozygotes for DQ2.2.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{gluten-free}} diet and its possible enrichment. It {{is divided into two}} parts. The first part includes chapters such as history of gluten-free diet, basics of a gluten free diet, {{the first step in the}} introduction of a gluten-free diet, gluten-free food labeling legislation and the use of alcohol on a gluten-free diet. The practical part is focused on enriching the diet celiac patients. I focused on the preparation of bakery products for celiac, I have designed and practically tested recipes gluten-free pizza, buckwheat corpus, gluten-free sourdough seedcake and gluten-free cake with homemade pudding and caramel. The finished gluten-free products were submitted after baking consumers who rated their sensory quality. If necessary, an adjustment was made to the recipe and re-perform sensory evaluation. The prepared products were evaluated positively. Selected <b>coeliacs</b> decided suggested products to include in their diet...|$|R

25|$|To address {{needs of}} people {{affected}} by gluten-related disorders (such as <b>coeliac</b> disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy sufferers), some recipes use rice or maize for making pasta. Grain flours may also be supplemented with cooked potatoes.|$|E
25|$|People {{may become}} {{malnourished}} due to abnormal nutrient loss (due to diarrhea or chronic illness affecting the small bowel).

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to assess the effect of {{introducing}} the second reduced rate of VAT of 10 % since 1 January 2015 on consumer behaviour when purchasing gluten‑free food. Monitoring {{the effect of the}} VAT rate reduction on selected gluten‑free food and products was a part of a research focused on gluten‑free consumer preferences when eating in restaurants (960 respondents were interviewed). Further research which was focused on the effect of the VAT rate reduction and which surveyed the consumer criteria when purchasing gluten‑free products addressed a total of 160 respondents with a gluten‑free diet. According to the respondents’ experience, the introduction of the second reduced VAT rate of 10 % has not significantly affected the prices for the final consumers. The reason for that may be the fact that the second reduced VAT rate applies mostly to ingredients used in gluten‑free production and only a few final products. A large group of <b>coeliacs</b> is not even aware of or has not registered the VAT change...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{gluten-free}} diet is {{the only}} available treatment for celiac disease. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} effect of a gluten-free diet on celiac disease related symptoms, health care consumption, and the risk of developing associated immune-mediated diseases. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 1, 560 randomly selected members of the Swedish Society for <b>Coeliacs,</b> divided into equal-sized age- and sex strata; 1, 031 (66 %) responded. Self-reported symptoms, health care consumption (measured by health care visits and hospitalization days), and missed working days were reported both for the year prior to diagnosis (normal diet) and the year prior to receiving the questionnaire while undergoing treatment with a gluten-free diet. Associated immune-mediated diseases (diabetes mellitus type 1, rheumatic disease, thyroid disease, vitiligo, alopecia areata and inflammatory bowel disease) were self-reported including the year of diagnosis. RESULTS: All investigated symptoms except joint pain improved after diagnosis and initiated gluten-free diet. Both health care consumption and missed working days decreased. Associated immune-mediated diseases were diagnosed equally often before and after celiac disease diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Initiated treatment with a gluten-free diet improves the situation for celiac disease patients in terms of reduced symptoms and health care consumption. An earlier celiac disease diagnosis is therefore of great importance...|$|R
