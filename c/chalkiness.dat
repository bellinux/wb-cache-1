30|$|<b>Chalkiness</b> is {{the other}} appearance-related trait that affects {{consumer}} acceptance of rice (Fitzgerald et al. 2009). Grain chalk is an important indicator of rice quality evaluation and a highly undesirable quality trait in marketing and consumption of the rice grain (Li et al. 2014 b). As a polygenic quantitative trait with complex inheritance pattern, <b>chalkiness</b> is highly influenced by the environment. Thus the genetic basis of grain <b>chalkiness</b> is still poorly understood, even though many QTLs for <b>chalkiness</b> or related components have also been identified ([URL] Peng et al. (2014) mapped multiple QTLs associated with six <b>chalkiness</b> traits (<b>chalkiness</b> rate, white core rate, white belly rate, <b>chalkiness</b> area, white core area, and white belly area) using five populations and suggested {{that most of the}} QTLs clustered together and could be detected in different backgrounds. Two loci controlling PGWC were mapped by Zhou et al. (2009), and the qPGWC- 7 was narrowed to a 44 -kb region. Chalk 5, regulating grain <b>chalkiness</b> was isolated by Li et al. (2014 b), which encodes a vacuolar H+-translocating pyrophosphatase (V-PPase) with PPi hydrolysis and H+-translocation activity. Elevated expression of Chalk 5 increases <b>chalkiness</b> of the endosperm by disturbing the pH homeostasis in the endomembrane trafficking system in developing seeds, which affects the biogenesis of protein bodies coupled with a great increase in small vesicle-like structures, thus forming air spaces among endosperm storage substances, resulting in chalky grain (Li et al. 2014 b). However, the regulation pathway and interaction mechanisms of rice <b>chalkiness</b> associated genes remain unclear.|$|E
40|$|Grain <b>chalkiness</b> is an {{important}} grain quality related to starch granules in the endosperm. A high percentage of grain <b>chalkiness</b> {{is a major problem}} because it diminishes grain quality in rice. Here, we report quantitative trait loci identification for grain <b>chalkiness</b> using high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping of a chromosomal segment substitution line population in which each line carried one or a few introduced japonica cultivar Nipponbare segments in the genetic background of the indica cultivar ZS 97. Ten quantitative trait loci regions were commonly identified for the percentage of grain <b>chalkiness</b> and the degree of endosperm <b>chalkiness.</b> The allelic effects at nine of these quantitative trait loci reduced grain <b>chalkiness.</b> Furthermore, a quantitative trait locus (qPGC 8 - 2) on chromosome 8 was validated in a chromosomal segment substitution line-derived segregation population, and had a stable effect on <b>chalkiness</b> in a multiple-environment evaluation of the near-isogenic lines. Residing on the qPGC 8 - 2 region, the isoamylase gene (ISA 1) was preferentially expressed in the endosperm and revealed some nucleotide polymorphisms between two varieties, Nipponbare and ZS 97. Transgenic lines with suppression of ISA 1 by RNA interference produced grains with 20 % more <b>chalkiness</b> than the control. The results support that the gene may underlie qPGC 8 - 2 for grain <b>chalkiness.</b> The multiple-environment trials of the near-isogenic lines also show that combination of the favorable alleles such as the ISA 1 gene for low <b>chalkiness</b> and the GS 3 gene for long grains considerably improved grain quality of ZS 97, which proves useful for grain quality improvement in rice breeding programs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Grain {{endosperm}} <b>chalkiness</b> of rice is a varietal {{characteristic that}} negatively affects {{not only the}} appearance and milling properties but also the cooking texture and palatability of cooked rice. However, grain <b>chalkiness</b> is a complex quantitative genetic trait and the molecular mechanisms underlying its formation are poorly understood. Results A near-isogenic line CSSL 50 - 1 with high <b>chalkiness</b> was compared with its normal parental line Asominori for grain endosperm <b>chalkiness.</b> Physico-biochemical analyses of ripened grains showed that, compared with Asominori, CSSL 50 - 1 contains higher levels of amylose and 8 DP (degree of polymerization) short-chain amylopectin, but lower medium length 12 DP amylopectin. Transcriptome analysis of 15 DAF (day after flowering) caryopses of the isogenic lines identified 623 differential expressed genes (P Conclusion Extensive gene expression changes were detected during rice grain <b>chalkiness</b> formation.

40|$|China is {{the first}} country to use {{heterosis}} successfully for commercial rice production. This study compared the main quality characteristics (head rice rate, chalky rice rate, <b>chalkiness</b> degree, gel consistency, amylose content, and length-to-width ratio) of 635 rice varieties (not including upland and glutinous rice) released from 2000 to 2014 to establish the quality status and offer suggestions for future rice breeding for grain quality in China. In the past 15 years, grain quality in japonica rice and indica hybrid rice has improved. In japonica rice, inbred varieties have increased head rice rates and decreased <b>chalkiness</b> degree over time, while hybrid rice varieties have decreased chalky rice rates and <b>chalkiness</b> degree. In indica hybrid rice, the <b>chalkiness</b> degree and amylose contents have decreased and gel consistency has increased. Improvements in grain quality in indica inbred rice have been limited, with some increases in head rice rate and decreases in chalky rice rate and amylose content. From 2010 to 2014, the percentage of indica varieties meeting the Grade III national standard of rice quality for different quality traits was low, especially for chalky rice rate and <b>chalkiness</b> degree. Japonica varieties have more superior grain quality than indica rice in terms of higher head rice rates and gel consistency, lower chalky rice rates and <b>chalkiness</b> degree, and lower amylose contents, {{which may explain why}} the Chinese prefer japonica rice. The japonica rice varieties, both hybrid and inbred, had similar grain qualities, but this varied in indica rice with the hybrid varieties having higher grain quality than inbred varieties due to significantly better head rice rates and lower <b>chalkiness</b> degree. For better quality rice in future, the chalky rice rate and <b>chalkiness</b> degree should be improved in japonica rice along with most of the quality traits in indica rice...|$|E

Using the Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS) approach, 2711 recombination bin markers with an average physical length of 137.68  kb were obtained, and a high-density genetic map was constructed. Global genetic mapping of QTLs affecting grain shape and <b>chalkiness</b> traits was performed across four environments and the newly identified stable loci were obtained. Twelve important QTL clusters were detected, four of which were coincident with the genomic regions of cloned genes or fine mapped QTL reported. Eight novel QTL clusters (including six for grain shape, one for <b>chalkiness,</b> and one for both grain shape and <b>chalkiness)</b> were firstly obtained and highlighted the value and reliability of the QTL analysis. The important QTL cluster on chromosome 5 affects multiple traits including circularity (CS), grain width (GW), area size of grain (AS), percentage of grains with <b>chalkiness</b> (PGWC) and degree of endosperm <b>chalkiness</b> (DEC), indicating some potentially pleiotropic effects.

30|$|Rice {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} food crops, and fed more than half of the population in the world. In recent years, with the increase of living standard, more and more attention has been paid on rice quality, including the appearance quality, processing quality, nutritional quality, and cooking and eating quality, etc. <b>Chalkiness</b> is an important indicator of the appearance quality for rice. As the opaque part in endosperm, it is an optical character caused by the air-gap of loose arrangement between proteinoplast and amyloplast. <b>Chalkiness</b> can be evaluated by indexes, including area of chalky endosperm (ACE), degree of chalky endosperm (DCE) and percentage of grains with <b>chalkiness</b> (PGWC) when it is associated with high level of damage to the kernel during milling, and thus to a reduction in head rice recovery (Del Rosario et al. 1968). Furthermore, when chalky grain is steamed or boiled, cracks develop readily, reducing the palatability of the cooked product (Nagato and Ebata 1959; Cheng et al. 2005). Therefore, clarification of the heredity of <b>chalkiness</b> and its molecular mechanisms is of important significance to reduce the <b>chalkiness,</b> improve the appearance quality and the commercial value of rice (Tan et al. 2000).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. As kernel dimensional-variability can {{adversely}} affect milling yield {{and quality of}} rice, limited thickness-grading to remove thin kernels was evaluated. Along with unfractioned (UNF) rice, rough rice was mechanically sieved, resulting in two thickness fractions, Thick (> 2 mm) and Thin (< 2 mm), of four currently-produced, long-grain cultivars. Milled-rice yield (MRY), head-rice yield (HRY), lipid and protein content, bulk density, and milled-rice <b>chalkiness</b> were determined for each cultivar/fraction. Thickness grading returned between 67 % and 90 % Thick kernels. MRYs of Thick kernels were greater than Thin, and trended greater than UNF. Moreover, HRYs of Thick kernels were greater than both Thin and UNF. For Thin, greater total lipid and crude protein content, and lower bulk density, suggest incompletely-filled kernels. Thick kernels had less <b>chalkiness</b> than Thin, and trended to less <b>chalkiness</b> compared to UNF. Thickness-grading improved milling-yield parameters of Thick, and showed promise for reducing <b>chalkiness.</b> Although thickness-grading to remove the Thin kernels would create an extra process operation and flow, benefits to milling yield, and to improved visual perception through reduced <b>chalkiness</b> and greater kernel uniformity, could justify this procedure...|$|E
30|$|GBSSI and SSIIa were {{strongly}} associated with AC, GC, DEC and PGWC {{in the present study}} (Tables  3 and 4; Additional file 2 : Figure S 1). This result might partially explain the negative correlation between AC and <b>chalkiness</b> although there is no direct evidence showing that AC contributes to the occurrence of endosperm <b>chalkiness</b> (Zhou et al. 2015 a, b). RMw 513 for gw 5 was {{strongly associated with}} grain shape traits and DEC. RM 18751, a marker for <b>chalkiness</b> QTL, was highly associated with GL (Table  3; Additional file 1 : Tables S 5 and S 7). These detected associations provided a genetic explanation of the reported correlation between grain shape and <b>chalkiness</b> (Adu-Kwarteng et al. 2003; Raju and Srinivas, 1991; Zhou et al. 2015 a). The pleiotropic effects of these genes might be explored for the purpose of improving eating and physical quality simultaneously.|$|E
30|$|Twenty nine markers were {{detected}} {{to be associated}} with DEC (Table  2; Additional file 1 : Table S 7). Among them, twenty one markers were very close to (less than 2  Mb) 26 known QTLs/genes regions for <b>chalkiness</b> (Additional file 2 : Figure S 1). Markers for the other 28 known QTLs/genes for <b>chalkiness</b> did not show significant associations with DEC. Eight markers were significant for DEC in three or more environments (Table  3). Three markers of SSIIa (SSIIaSNP 2, SSIIa-IF and SSIIa-F), explained 5.52 [*]~[*] 15.35  % of the phenotypic variance across the six environments (Table  3). In the SSIIa region seven QTLs for <b>chalkiness</b> had been reported. Two markers on GBSSI (GBSSI- 1 -IF and GBSSI- 3 -IF), which is also close to the seven <b>chalkiness</b> QTLs, were highly associated with DEC as well. RMw 513 and RM 18068, linked to chalk 5, were also associated with DEC and explained more than 5  % of the phenotypic variance in most environments. RI 02451 located to the region of three QTLs for <b>chalkiness</b> was associated with DEC in four environments. Other 21 markers only associated with DEC in one or two environments with relatively small effects (Additional file 1 : Table S 7).|$|E
40|$|Percentage of grains with <b>chalkiness</b> (PGWC), one of rice {{appearance}} quality, {{varies in}} different rice varieties. A high PGWC results in lowering {{the density of}} starch granules and the grains {{are more prone to}} breakage during milling (Del Rosario et al. 1968). Also, since both longitudinal and transverse cracks occur easily in chalky kernels when the grain is steamed or boiled, <b>chalkiness</b> reduces the palatability of cooked rice (Nagato and Ebata 1959, Hiromoto et al. 2007). Because the Japanese and North Chinese market prefer sticky rice, the rice grains with a chalky appearance are easily recognized and result in low sale prices. On the other hand, rice cultivars with <b>chalkiness</b> are useful for the production of special food, an example of which is sake, a Japanese liquor. So far, the differences in grain <b>chalkiness</b> in different rice varieties are poorly understood at the molecular level. Thus, it is imperative to determine the underlying biochemical mechanism for grain <b>chalkiness,</b> by fine mapping and identification of the major QTLs of PGWC. Previously, a set of chromosome segment substitution lines carrying overlapping chromosome segments of Pai 64 S in a genetic background of elite cultivar 9311 had been constructed by our laboratory (Xiao et al. 2005).

The <b>chalkiness</b> parameters were measured {{with an automatic}} machine JMWT 12 according to Xu et al. (2012). Two metrics were used to describe grain <b>chalkiness</b> as previously described (Zhao et al. 2016 a): percentage of grains with chalk (PGWC) and degree of endosperm <b>chalkiness</b> (DEC) which is the ratio of total chalky area to the total kernel area of all sampled grains. The {{statistical analysis was performed}} with SPSS statistics 18.0 and Microsoft Excel.|$|E
30|$|<b>Chalkiness</b> is an {{important}} trait of rice appearance. High positive correlations were found between ACE, DCE and PGWC in both Hainan and Hangzhou demonstrated <b>chalkiness</b> related traits were significantly correlated. In addition, GW was found correlated positively with PGWC and DCE in both environments, which consistent with overlapping regions of qGW 4, qPGWC 4 and qDCE 4 detected in Hangzhou (Gao et al. 2013). This conclusion was also proved by Bian et al. (2013), they use a segregating population derived from sgw (low GW) and cultivar 9311 (high GW) to detect qsgw 7 associated with GW, and developed the NILqsgw 7 which show lower grain width and <b>chalkiness</b> of brown rice than 9311.|$|E
30|$|Strong {{associations}} between SSIIa and <b>chalkiness</b> were {{found by the}} single marker based analysis and the haplotype based analysis (Tables  3 and 4). More phenotypic variation {{could be explained by}} differences in haplotypes. Many studies have revealed the effects of SSIIa, especially the GC/TT SNPs (SSIIa-IF) of exon 8, on gelatinization temperature, cooking time and cooking quality (Bao et al. 2006; Cuevas et al. 2010; Umemoto and Aoki, 2005). All three loci of the SSIIa gene, 9  bp deletion on 5 '-UTR (SSIIa-F), GC/TT SNPs (SSIIa-IF) and G/A SNP (SSIIaSNP 2), were associated with DEC and PGWC in all the six environments (Table  4). The phenotypic variation explained by SSIIa haplotype was about twice of that by GBSSI in our indica population. In addition, association between SSIIa and <b>chalkiness</b> was also reported in previous study using a panel of japonica advanced lines (Kharabian-Masouleh et al. 2012). Furthermore, <b>chalkiness</b> of RNAi-repressed SSIIa lines was increased significantly, from 11.4 [*]±[*] 1.2  % (Wild type) to 28.4 [*]±[*] 5.1  %, since the transgenetic kernels always contained white bellies or white backs and seed weight was decreased as well (Zhang et al. 2011). Therefore, SSIIa might be one of the important starch biosynthesizing genes for developing low chalky rice. Highly significant {{associations between}} GBSSI and DEC and PGWC were identified respectively in five and four environments by the haplotype analysis (Table  4). QTLs for <b>chalkiness</b> components were previously mapped to the GBSSI region using different mapping populations derived from indica/indica or indica/japonica crosses (Peng et al. 2014; Tan et al. 2000). AC and <b>chalkiness</b> was negatively correlated in the population used in this study, and a strong negative correlation between AC and <b>chalkiness</b> was also found in a population of 238 newly released indica varieties in China (Zhou et al. 2015 a, b). Therefore, it appeared that GBSSI might be important for improving appearance quality in indica rice. However, the association between GBSSI and <b>chalkiness</b> was not identified in a population of 233 Australian japonica rice breeding lines (Kharabian-Masouleh et al. 2012).|$|E
30|$|The {{identification}} of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for rice <b>chalkiness</b> and elucidation {{of the underlying}} genetic regulation mechanism are necessary {{for the development of}} markers for marker assisted selection (MAS) strategies in rice breeding (Yan and Bao 2014). Series of QTLs related to <b>chalkiness</b> have been mapped hitherto by different populations including DH, F 2 and RIL. Zeng et al. (2002) detected 9 QTLs for <b>chalkiness</b> on chromosomes 8, 11 and 12 respectively with 127 DH lines from transverse section, flank section and belly section. And the intervals and peaks of QTLs on 3 chromosomes were overlapped, some of them even uniform. A total of 22 QTLs for <b>chalkiness</b> were indentified with a population involving 66 chromosomal segment substitution lines (CSSLs) across eight environments, and 9 QTLs were consistently detected across 8 environments, which indicated the 9 QTL alleles were more stable than other 13 QTL alleles (Wan et al. 2005). By using an F 8 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population consisting of 261 lines derived from a cross between Koshihikari and C 602, Liu et al. (2012) detected three QTLs related to PGWC on chromosomes 5, 8 and 10. Zhao et al. (2015 b) used the QK model to declare the usefulness of the targeted genes/QTLs. And SSIIa was the major gene for <b>chalkiness</b> and explained up to 17 and 21  % of variation of DEC and PGWC, respectively. In addition, the markers RMw 513 and RM 18068 were associated with DEC in 6 environments as well, and allelic combinations between SSIIa, RMw 513 revealed more variations in DEC. Besides, many QTLs were fine mapped in limited region. Guo et al. (2011) narrowed down the qPGWC- 8 to a 142  kb region between two Indel markers 8 G- 7 and 8 G- 9. Recently, Sun et al. (2015) identified 10 common QTLs for the percentage of grain <b>chalkiness</b> and the degree of chalky endosperm using high-through-put single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of a CSSLs population, and validated the isoamylase gene (ISA 1) residing on the qPGC 8 - 2 region, which preferentially expressed in the endosperm and revealed some nucleotide polymorphisms between the parents. Because <b>chalkiness</b> is controlled by multiple genes and its genetic mechanism is relatively complex, so far, only one major QTL for <b>chalkiness,</b> Chalk 5, has been cloned in rice (Li et al. 2014).|$|E

This study evaluated head rice yield and <b>chalkiness</b> in dry season of PTT 1 from different regions of Thailand. Samples of dry season 2011 crop of PTT 1 were collected from the Upper North, Lower North, Central, East, and Northeast. Sixty-seven paddy samples were dehulled and milled individually. The milled rice of each sample was separated into head and broken rice to determine percentage of head rice. Percentage of <b>chalkiness</b> was determined by weight of chalky grain, in both whole and broken grain. The Central region had the highest percentage of <b>chalkiness</b> (49. 1 %) and head rice (46. 4 %), while the lowest percentage of head rice was found in rice from the Upper North (29. 8 %) and Northeast (26. 6 %). The lowest percentage <b>chalkiness</b> was found in samples from the Northeast (29. 5 %), Upper North (26. 0 %). The Lower north had percentage of head rice and <b>chalkiness</b> as well as Central. The negative correlation between percentage of head rice and <b>chalkiness</b> was found only in samples from the Northeast (r = - 0. 87, p < 0. 001), but not from the other regions. This suggests that the reason for grain breakage may be more complex than the lessening of milling resistance of chalky grain.

With a population composed of 37 introgression lines (ILs) of Habataki {{in the background of}} Sasanishiki, 54 QTLs were identified for grain quality across two different environments (Bian et al. 2014). Among them, the qPGWC.NH- 1.2 for percentage of grains with <b>chalkiness</b> was located in the same region indentified by us on chromosomes 1. Recently, Zhao et al. (2015 a) used two sets of RILs derived from reciprocal crosses between Lemont and Teqing to study the genetic basis of <b>chalkiness.</b> A total of 53 and 68 QTLs were detected for DEC and PGWC respectively, among which qDEC 6, qDEC 9, qPGWC 6, qPGWC 1 d, qPGWC 9 a, qPGWC 9 b were also identified here in the overlapping region. Because of no difference in CDS of chalk 5 between 9311 and PA 64 s by sequencing, there was no QTL detected in the region on chromosome 5 here.|$|E

QTL NILs showed that {{each had a}} significant effect on chalk. Abstract: Chalk in rice grains leads to a significant loss in the proportion of marketable grains in a harvested crop, leading to a significant financial loss to rice farmers and traders. To identify the genetic basis of <b>chalkiness,</b> two sets of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from reciprocal crosses between Lemont and Teqing were used to find stable QTLs for <b>chalkiness.</b> The RILs were grown in seven locations in Asia and Latin American and in two controlled environments in phytotrons. A total of 32 (21) and 46 (22) QTLs for DEC and PGWC, most of them explaining more than 10  % of phenotypic variation, were detected based on single environment analysis in T/L (L/T) population, respectively. Seven (2) and 7 (3) QTLs for DEC and PGWC were identified in the T/L (L/T) population using joined analysis across all environments, respectively. Six major QTLs clusters were found on five chromosomes: 1, 2, 4, 5 and 11. The biggest cluster at id 4007289 -RM 252 on Chr 04 was a novelty, including 16 and 4 QTLs detected by single environment analysis and joint mapping across all environments, respectively. The detected digenic epistatic QTLs explained up to 13  % of phenotypic variation, suggesting that epistasis {{play an important role in}} the genetic control of <b>chalkiness</b> in rice. QTL NILs showed that each QTL cluster {{had a significant effect}} on chalk. These chromosomal regions could be targets for MAS, fine mapping and map-based cloning for low <b>chalkiness</b> breeding...|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{demonstrate}} the discrepancy in the morphology and cytological structure of two contrasting genotypes and the phenotypic variance of the grain shape and <b>chalkiness</b> traits across a RIL population. Using NGS, a high-density genetic map was constructed {{based on the}} new developed bin markers. The QTLs associated with grain shape and <b>chalkiness</b> were identified under four different environments. Moreover, we performed transcriptome expression profiling and identified differentially expressed genes located in the chalkiness-related QTL regions, providing valuable information for candidate gene verification and dissection of gene regulatory networks affecting rice grain appearance quality.|$|E
30|$|A {{number of}} studies {{reported}} major genes/QTLs for rice grain shapes, <b>chalkiness</b> and starch physicochemical properties. For these finely mapped QTLs or cloned genes {{to make an impact}} in practical breeding, it is necessary to test their effects in different genetic backgrounds. In this study, two hundred nineteen markers for 20 starch synthesis genes, 41 fine mapped grain shape and related traits QTLs/genes, and 54 <b>chalkiness</b> QTLs/genes plus 15 additional markers and a large indica population of 375 advanced lines were used to identify marker-trait associations under 6 environments that can be used directly in breeding for grain quality traits.|$|E
30|$|Another {{advantageous}} {{feature of}} our study was {{the integration of the}} QTL mapping of chalkiness-related traits and the transcriptome profiling. Obtaining gene expression information using bulked RIL pools is simple, effective and aim-focused (Kloosterman et al. 2010), making it possible to assay a large number of our subjects. Hence it became possible to identify and narrow down our search for putative candidate genes affecting chalkiness-related traits. By this analysis, several differentially expressed genes in the three QTL intervals on chromosomes 5, 7 and 8 appear to have high probability of the target genes, considering their protein function prediction information as well. For instance, bidirectional sugar transporter SWEET 3 a, which was identified to be a DEG located on the region of qPGWC 5 (qDEC 5), is involved in carbohydrate transmembrane transport process ([URL] and predicted to mediate both low-affinity uptake and efflux of sugar across the plasma membrane ([URL] The major up-regulated expression observed in P 02428 is highly likely to influence carbohydrate transport and result in high levels of <b>chalkiness.</b> In another example, Os 07 g 0604800 (OsUAM 3) which co-located with the qPGWC 7 (qDEC 7) QTL in our study and the previously reported qPGWC 7 QTL (Zhou et al. 2009) was detected to be sharply down-regulated in the L-Pool and PYZX compared to the H-Pool and P 02428. OsUAM 3 gene has an annotated as having UDP-arabinopyranose mutase activity ([URL] and was predicted to be analpha- 1, 4 -glucan-protein synthase and UDP-glucose/protein transglucosylase 1 ([URL] Given that carbohydrate metabolism is considered {{to play an important role}} in endosperm <b>chalkiness</b> (Wang et al. 2008), these DEGs represent strong candidates for genes underlying these chalkiness-associated QTLs. For instance, the rice GIF 1 (GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1) gene is required for carbon partitioning during early grain-filling and the gif 1 mutant grains showed more <b>chalkiness,</b> which accumulated lower levels of glucose and fructose, as well as sucrose (Wang et al. 2008). The UGPase 1 gene played a key role in seed carbohydrate metabolism and inactivation of the UGPase 1 gene caused endosperm <b>chalkiness</b> in rice (Woo et al. 2008). The several DEGs we identified here were involved in carbohydrate synthesis or transportation, indicating their potential role in the formation of endosperm <b>chalkiness.</b> Our identification of 668 functionally annotated DEGs between bulked RIL pools (Additional file 3 : Table S 5) provides a basis for dissecting the regulatory network governing the <b>chalkiness</b> trait. While detailed insight into these genes will be of great importance in unraveling the complex nature of rice <b>chalkiness</b> and also in elucidating the role of the diverse QTLs involved. The integrated approach utilizing the identified stable QTLs and transcriptome profiling could serve as a platform for candidate gene identification for genetic dissection and provide basal tools for molecular breeding in rice.|$|E
30|$|Using the Genotyping-By-Sequencing approach, {{a genetic}} linkage map {{with an average}} {{distance}} of 0.865  cM between adjacent markers was constructed based on a RIL population in rice. A global mapping of quantitative trait loci affecting the grain shape and <b>chalkiness</b> traits were detected on four environments and the stable QTL clusters were highlighted and analyzed. The results of the transcriptome analysis demonstrated an available gene expression profile responsible {{for the development of}} <b>chalkiness,</b> and several important differentially expressed genes were co-located on the chalkiness-related QTL regions on chromosomes 5, 7, and 8. Critical loci were investigated and identified as candidate genes, which were suitable for functional validation and breeding utilization.|$|E
30|$|GBSSI and SSIIa {{were two}} major genes {{affecting}} AC and GC. GBSSI and SSIIa also affectted <b>chalkiness</b> formation in rice. SSI, SSIIIb and ISA 2 {{were associated with}} AC. AGPS 1, AGPS 2, APGL 2, BEI, BEIIa, ISA 1, SSIIb, SSIIc, SSIIIa and SSIVa did not affect any of the measured traits in the present study. Only 10 markers for 12 genes/QTLs related to grain shape or yield {{were found to be}} associated with grain shape traits. <b>Chalkiness</b> was affected by starch biosynthesising genes and genes related to grain shapes. The validated markers for genes/QTLs with major effects could be directly used in breeding for grain quality via marker-assisted selection.|$|E
