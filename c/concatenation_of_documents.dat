40|$|Most {{documents}} are {{about more than}} one subject, {{but the majority of}} natural language processing algorithms and information retrieval techniques implicitly assume that every document has just one topic. The work described herein is about clues which mark shifts to new topics, algorithms for identifying topic boundaries and the uses of such boundaries once identified. ^ A number of topic shift indicators have been proposed in the literature. We review these features, suggest several new ones and test most of them in implemented topic segmentation algorithms. Hints about topic boundaries include repetitions of character sequences, patterns of word and word n-gram repetition, word frequency, the presence of cue words and phrases and the use of synonyms. ^ The algorithms we present use cues singly or in combination to identify topic shifts in several kinds <b>of</b> <b>documents.</b> One algorithm tracks compression performance, which is an indicator of topic shift because self-similarity within topic segments should be greater than between-segment similarity. Another technique relies on word repetition and places boundaries by minimizing word repetitions across segment boundaries. A third method compares the performance of a language model with and without knowledge of the contents of preceding sentences to determine whether a topic shift has occurred. We use the output of this algorithm in a statistical model which incorporates synonymy, bigram repetition and other features for topic segmentation. ^ We benchmark our algorithms and compare them to algorithms from the literature using <b>concatenations</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> and then perform further evaluation of our techniques using a collection of news broadcasts transcribed both by annotators and using a speech recognition system. We also test the effectiveness of our algorithms for identifying both chapter boundaries in works of literature and story boundaries in Spanish news broadcasts. ^ We suggest ways to improve information retrieval, language modeling and various natural language processing algorithms by exploiting the topic segmentation. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} problem of keyword search in a data cube with text-rich dimension(s) (so-called text cube). The text cube is built on a multidimensional text database, where each row is {{associated}} with some text data (e. g., a document) and other structural dimensions (attributes). A cell in the text cube aggregates a set <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> with matching attribute values in a subset of dimensions. A cell <b>document</b> is the <b>concatenation</b> <b>of</b> all <b>documents</b> in a cell. Given a keyword query, {{our goal is to}} find the top-k most relevant cells (ranked according to the relevance scores <b>of</b> cell <b>documents</b> w. r. t. the given query) in the text cube. We define a keyword-based query language and apply IR-style relevance model for scoring and ranking cell documents in the text cube. We propose two efficient approaches to find the top-k answers. The proposed approaches support a general class of IR-style relevance scoring formulas that satisfy certain basic and common properties. One of them uses more time for pre-processing and less time for answering online queries; and the other one is more efficient in pre-processing and consumes more time for online queries. Experimental studies on the ASRS dataset are conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches. 1...|$|R

For the first one, we use the <b>concatenation</b> <b>of</b> the comments from each sequence C^d as a document p, with all series d ∈D from the data set being considered in P for the IDF calculation. For the second, each document p is constructed from the <b>concatenation</b> <b>of</b> the comments of each sequence C^t belonging to an episode t ∈T^D, for a given series D. The set <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> P considered for it is built only from the episodes of this single series d.|$|R

50|$|In mathematics, {{concatenation}} is the joining of two numbers {{by their}} numerals.
