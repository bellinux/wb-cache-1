40|$|The {{automatic}} {{interpretation of}} conventional traffic signs is very complex and time consuming. The paper concerns an {{automatic warning system}} for driving assistance. It does not interpret the standard traffic signs on the roadside; the proposal is to incorporate into the existing signs another type of traffic sign whose information will be more easily interpreted by a processor. The type of information to be added is profuse and therefore the most important object is the robustness of the system. The basic proposal of this new philosophy is that the <b>co-pilot</b> <b>system</b> for automatic warning and driving assistance can interpret with greater ease {{the information contained in}} the new sign, whilst the human driver only has to interpret the "classic" sign. One of the codings that has been tested with good results and which seems to us easy to implement is that which has a rectangular shape and 4 vertical bars of different colours. The size of these signs is equivalent {{to the size of the}} conventional signs (approximately 0. 4 m 2). The colour information from the sign can be easily interpreted by the proposed processor and the interpretation is much easier and quicker than the information shown by the pictographs of the classic sign...|$|E

25|$|The WC-130J {{employs a}} {{standard}} five person crew {{element of a}} pilot, <b>co-pilot,</b> Combat <b>Systems</b> Officer (CSO), aerial reconnaissance weather officer (ARWO), and a weather loadmaster/dropsonde operator, with a second loadmaster assigned when required. The ARWO is the flight meteorologist and acts as flight director inside the storm system. Operational crews train twice monthly at Keesler AFB and fly weather recon missions when available. 53d WRS pilots and loadmasters go through their initial C-130J training at the 314th Airlift Wing's tactical airlift training center at Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas. CSOs and ARWOs from the 53d WRS have no formal school and train in-house at Keesler utilizing an Air Education and Training Command-approved syllabus for their specialized mission training.|$|R

Most images contain areas that are of little or no interest to vision tasks. An attentive, data-driven, approach to feature detection and tracking is proposed which aims to increase the efficiency of feature detection and tracking by focusing attention onto relevant regions of the image likely to contain scene structure. This attentive algorithm lends itself naturally to parallelisation and results from a parallel implementation are presented. A scene may be segmented into independently moving objects {{based on the assumption that}} features belonging to the same object will move in an identical way in three dimensions (this assumes objects are rigid). A model for scene segmentation is proposed that uses information contained within feature trajectories to cluster, or group, features into independently moving objects. This information includes: image-plane position, time-to-collision of a feature with the image-plane, and the type of motion observed. The Multiple Model Adaptive Estimator (MMAE) algorithm is extended to cope with constituent filters with different states (MMAE 2) in an attempt to accurately estimate the time-to-collision of a feature and provide a reliable idea of the type of motion observed (in the form of a model belief measure). Finally, poor state initialisation is identified as a likely prime cause for poor Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) performance (and hence poor MMAE 2 performance) when using high order models. The idea of the neurofuzzy initialised EKF (NF-EKF) is introduced which attempts to reduce the time for an EKF to converge by improving the accuracy of the EKF's initial state estimates...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} {{the design of}} an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) that ensures safety when traffic rules are respected by all road users. This concept, referred to as legal safety, is proposed as a basis that permits human and automated drivers to share the road infrastructure. It is illustrated for a Highly Automated driving System with speed keeping, distance keeping and lane changing functionalities on highways (HAS). The requirements legal safety places upon HAS components are presented, with a special focus on the co-pilot which calculates a safe trajectory for the vehicle based on perception of lanes and traffic signs and prediction of the trajectories of objects in the environment. A lane coordinate system is proposed as a powerful reference for the trajectory calculations of the <b>co-pilot.</b> The <b>system</b> controls the vehicle and communicates with the driver, according to an automation mode scheme inspired by the horse-rider metaphor (H-metaphor) ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that collision mitigation on low grip surfaces might require autonomous vehicles to execute maneuvers such as drift, trail braking or Scandinavian flick. In order to achieve this {{it is necessary to}} perceive the vehicle states and their interaction with the environment, and use this information to determine the chassis limits. A first look at the virtual automotive sensing problem is provided, followed by a description of Rally driving modeling approaches. Finally, a <b>co-pilot</b> collision mitigation <b>system</b> for loose surfaces based on a Rally driver Model is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Unmanned Airborne Systems (UAS) offer {{significant}} {{benefits for}} long duration missions. They {{can also be}} used in many situations where it is inappropriate to expose aircrew to increased levels of risk. Partly in consequence, they continue to experience accident rates that are significantly higher than those for most conventional aircraft. UAS are largely confined to segregated areas that are well away from other airspace users. However, there are growing commercial and political pressures for them to be integrated into airspace that is directly under the control of air traffic management. Police agencies would like to deploy miniature UAS in populated areas, for example, to augment conventional helicopter operations. There are proposals to operate unmanned freight operations from existing airports. Longer-term proposals include the use of UAS technology to replace the <b>co-pilot.</b> Automated <b>systems</b> might intervene only if the single human pilot is incapacitated. These proposals raise a host of concerns. In particular, the following pages focus on the computational issues that must be addressed before UAS operations can be integrated without undermining the safety of controlled airspace...|$|R
5000|$|The WC-130J was {{the first}} variant {{obtained}} new from the factory since 1965. Ten were procured and assigned to the 53d WRS, now the only manned weather reconnaissance unit in the Department of Defense. The new model encountered teething problems that delayed its Initial Operational Capability until just before the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Conversion of the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules greatly enhanced the capability and safety of the WC-130 in its penetration of tropical cyclones on critical [...] "fix" [...] missions. The WC-130J carries a minimum crew of five: pilot/aircraft commander, <b>co-pilot,</b> combat <b>systems</b> officer, aerial reconnaissance weather officer and weather reconnaissance loadmaster. The 53d WRS maintains twenty air crews (ten full-time and ten part-time) to meet its capabilities obligations in support of requirements for the National Hurricane Operations Plan of five sorties per day from Keesler AFB and two from deployed locations. Weather data instrumentation and the dropsonde delivery and recording systems are mounted in the aircraft on removable pallets at {{the front end of}} the cargo compartment, giving the aircraft a standard cargo mission capability also.|$|R

40|$|CernVM Co-Pilot is a {{framework}} for instantiating an ad-hoc computing infrastructure on top of managed or unmanaged computing resources. Co-Pilot can either {{be used to create}} a stand-alone computing infrastructure, or to integrate new computing resources into existing infrastructures (such as Grid or batch). Unlike traditional middleware <b>systems,</b> <b>Co-Pilot</b> components communicate using the Extensible Messaging and Presence protocol (XMPP). This allows the system to be easily scaled in case of a high load, and it also simplifies the development of new components. In this contribution we present the latest developments and the current status of the framework, discuss how it can be extended to suit the needs of a particular community, as well as describe the operational experience of using the framework in the LHC@home 2. 0 volunteer computing project...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} dedicated to assemble the hardware system of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in order to prepare the platform for an autonomous flight {{in the air for}} a given path through the pre-programmed check points. A UAV is an aircraft that contains sensors, GPS, radio system, servomechanisms and computers, which provide the capability of an autonomous flight without a human pilot in the cockpit. A stable flight requires sensing the roll, pitch, and yaw angles of aircraft. Roll and pitch angles were ensured by a sensor system of FMA Direct Company called <b>co-pilot</b> flight stabilization <b>system</b> (CPD 4), which allows controlling ailerons and elevator manually. An autopilot is required for steering the aircraft autonomously according the GPS data and the establish waypoints that the airplane have to pass by. The GPS gives heading information to the autopilot, and this uses the information of the next waypoint to decide which direction to go. Hereby an autonomous flight is provided. In this project a lego mindstorm NXT was used as an autopilot that is product of LEGO Company [1]. The output of the autopilot is used to control the airplane servos to fly in the desired direction. A software and hardware interface was designed to allow the autopilot to receive the data from the co-pilot sensor and to transmit data to the co-pilot processor, which will finally steer the actuator servos. Experiments were performed with different parts of the system and the results reported...|$|R
