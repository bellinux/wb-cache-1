5|$|In {{the sixth}} stage, Aucouturier, Garin and Dortignac escaped {{in the last}} kilometres. Aucouturier signed first at the <b>control</b> <b>post</b> in Ville-d'Avray. From that point, the race was neutralised until the velodrome Parc-des-Princes, where the riders would ride the final kilometre. At the moment that the riders arrived in Paris, it started to rain. The organisers decided {{together}} with the cyclists to exclude the final kilometre from the race, and make the <b>control</b> <b>post</b> in Ville-d'Avray {{the end of the}} race. This made Aucouturier the winner of the stage. Maurice Garin finished second, which made him the overall winner.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventh}} stage to Bordeaux, Trousselier {{punctured}} {{after only a}} few kilometers. The rest of the cyclists quickly sped away from him, and Trousselier had to follow them alone for 200km. A few kilometers before Bordeaux, Trousselier caught up with the rest, and even managed to win the sprint. Louis Trousselier kept his lead {{until the end of the}} race, winning five stages. Trousselier was accused of bad sportsmanship: he reportedly smashed the inkstands of a <b>control</b> <b>post</b> to prevent his opponents from signing. Unlike the 1904 Tour de France, no stage winners, nor anyone from the top ten of the general classification, were disqualified.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} stage, the riders fell {{after only a}} few kilometres. Lipman broke a finger, and became the first rider to abandon this Tour. Around 100km in the race, Lucien Pothier lost ten minutes to the main group, led by Maurice Garin, because of a broken bicycle. In Cosne, at 174km, Pothier had reached the leading group. Aucouturier had lost more than one hour at that point. Just before the next <b>control</b> <b>post</b> in Nevers, Aucouturier fell on his face, and {{continued}} the race covered in blood. In {{the last part of the}} race, Maurice Garin and Lucien Pothier rode away from the others. They were attacked by four masked men in a car, but still finished as the first two, with Garin beating Pothier by 50m. The many flat tires and crashes of Aucouturier, seemingly the results of sabotage, gave him a time loss of several hours.|$|E

5|$|On May 1, 1899, Captain Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich assumed {{command of}} Rostislav, {{becoming}} the first Romanov since Peter I to command a combat ship. Another Romanov, Grand Duke Kirill, spent a few uneventful months on board Rostislav in 1900. Alexander's guests, parties and diplomatic visits to Istanbul regularly interfered with the crew's duties, but he personally managed the repairs and alterations of the ship's equipment. Shipyards and contractors treated Rostislav as a priority customer. Alexander, based on his experience with Sissoi Veliky, persuaded the NTC to reinforce Rostislavs rudder frame and supervised installation of a backup <b>control</b> <b>post</b> deep under the conning tower. In 1903 Alexander was promoted to rear admiral {{and returned to his}} ship as a squadron commander. Rostislav served as the junior flagship of the Black Sea Fleet until September 1912.|$|E
5|$|The Gore letter did spur some {{progress}} in negotiations, as the Soviet Union allowed in late November 1958 for explicit control measures {{to be included}} in the text of the drafted treaty. By March 1959, the negotiators had agreed upon seven treaty articles, but they primarily concerned uncontroversial issues and a number of disputes over verification persisted. First, the Soviet verification proposal was deemed by the West to be too reliant on self-inspection, with control posts primarily staffed by citizens of the country housing the posts and a minimal role for officials from the international supervisory body. The West insisted that half of a <b>control</b> <b>post</b> staff be drawn from another nuclear state and half from neutral parties. Second, the Soviet Union required that the international supervisory body, the Control Commission, require unanimity before acting; the West rejected the idea of giving Moscow a veto over the Commission's proceedings. Finally, the Soviet Union preferred temporary inspection teams drawn from citizens of the country under inspection, while the West insisted on permanent teams composed of inspectors from the Control Commission.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of the long-range BCN 520 with 12-inch guns rendered all previous gun defenses in the Charleston area obsolete. BCN 520 was armed with guns removed from Battery Kimble at Fort Travis, Galveston, Texas. Almost all of Fort Moultrie's previous armament was scrapped in 1942, except Battery Thompson's pair of 10-inch guns and Battery Lord's pair of 3-inch guns. The two fixed emplacements of AMTB 2A were built on the former 10-inch Battery Jasper. A Harbor Entrance <b>Control</b> <b>Post</b> (HECP) to coordinate Army and Navy harbor defenses was established at the old fort and has been refurbished as an exhibit.|$|E
25|$|Other {{branches}} of the South African National Defence Force also operate several radar systems that can assist the South African Air Force. The South African Navy utilises four Valour-class frigates, {{each of which is}} equipped with the Thales Naval France MRR-3D NG G-band multi-role surveillance/self-defence radar that can detect low and medium-level targets at ranges of up to 140km and in long-range 3D air surveillance mode targets up to 180km. In the self-defence mode, it can detect and track any threat within a radius of 60km. These Frigates can link their data systems to the Link ZA system to help create a broader picture for the armed forces. The South African Army also operates several Reutech Radar Systems (RRS) ESR220 Thutlhwa (Kameelperd/Giraffe) Mobile Battery Fire <b>Control</b> <b>Post</b> Systems. These NATO D-Band radars have a range of 120km and can also be linked to Link ZA to assist air force operations.|$|E
25|$|Coastal fortifications on {{the naval}} front {{protected}} Krepost Sveaborg from an {{attack from the}} sea. During the war new fortifications were built on the outlying islands pushing the defences outward to protect the ships in the harbour from new modern guns. During the First World War the naval front of the fortress was modernized almost completely. The new gun batteries {{can be divided into}} four types: heavy long range batteries, close range batteries, anti-landing batteries equipped with field guns and anti-aircraft batteries which appeared during the war for the first time. The naval front was divided into six sectors {{at the start of the}} war with sectors 1-4 comprising the old fortress, sector 5 Isosaari and sector 6 Melkki. The central fire <b>control</b> <b>post</b> was located in Vallisaari. As the new coastal forts were completed the organization changed and the naval front was divided into two parts: an outer main line of defence from Melkki to Isosaari and an inner second line of defence from Lauttasaari to Santahamina. The naval front command post was located in Vallisaari and the main artillery command post in Kuivasaari.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe use {{data about}} the Italian Constitutional Court (1956 – 2006) to verify an {{implication}} of the “revisionist” explanation of judicial independence related to judicial appointments, namely that elected politicians reward more independent justices with appointments to politically <b>controlled</b> <b>posts</b> after their Court tenure expires. In this respect, the Court tenure serves as a screening device for politicians to ascertain the justices’ personal independence. The empirical strategy is two-step. First, we estimate a logit fixed-effect model to evaluate the personal degree of independence for each justice reporter. This “justice-effect” {{is based on the}} proneness of a justice to declare the constitutional illegitimacy of a law controlling for the environmental conditional phenomena.

Dempsey believed that if the operation were to succeed, his tanks would need to be on the ridge by the first afternoon and cancelled a second attack by heavy bombers scheduled for the first afternoon; although this was to be in direct support of the advance towards the ridge, he was concerned that the 11th Armoured Division should not be delayed waiting for the strike. Close air support for Goodwood would be provided by No. 83 Group RAF, to neutralise German positions on the flanks of VIII Corps, strong points such as the village of Cagny, attacking German gun and reserve positions and the interdiction of German troop movements.
