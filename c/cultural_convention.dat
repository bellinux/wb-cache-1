We reflect on our design of the user-interface, and relate our design experience to theories of artefact design, evaluating from this case study how the theories apply to the broader design context of design for AR. Theories of ‘good design’ in artefact design literature do not unilaterally apply to the design for an augmented reality device. In many cases, design in AR fields requires the designer to create new <b>cultural</b> <b>conventions</b> by virtue {{of the fact that the}} designer is immersing the user in an unfamiliar environment. Thus, the designer is often unable to utilise affordances and existing <b>cultural</b> <b>conventions</b> because the functions and/or use of the object expands the environment in which affordances and <b>cultural</b> <b>conventions</b> currently have meaning...|$|R

The analysis of the schema, the rhetorical structures, and <b>cultural</b> <b>conventions</b> is limited to: i) the overall schema of a seminar; ii) the major components of a presentation; iii) the exchange structure of the question and answer sessions; iv) the rhetorical structure of presentation introductions; iv) the rhetorical structure of questions; and v) the rhetorical structure of answers. The data were obtained from tape and video recordings of four groups of student seminars as presented below. 1. Indonesian students' seminars conducted in Indonesian in Indonesian academic settings. 2. Indonesian students' seminars conducted in English in Indonesian academic settings. 3. Australian students' seminars conducted in English in Australian academic settings. 4. Australian students' seminars conducted in Indonesian in Australian academic settings. The Indonesian students' seminars in Indonesian and in English were held at the IKIP (Higher Institution for Teacher Training) Padang, West Sumatra, Indonesia. The Australian students' seminars in English were held at Curtin University of Technology, Australia. The Australian students' seminars in Indonesian were held at Curtin University of Technology and Murdoch University, Australia. The ++seminars were part of students' course assignments. The topics of the seminars were social and educational issues. The age of the students ranged from 20 to 30 years old. A total of 67 seminars comprised the data. The findings have shown that:(i) Indonesian students transfer their Ll schema, rhetorical structures, and <b>cultural</b> <b>conventions</b> when engaging in seminars conducted in English in Indonesian academic settings. (ii) Australian students transfer their Ll schema, rhetorical structures, and <b>cultural</b> <b>conventions</b> when engaging in seminars conducted in Indonesian in Australian academic settings. (iii) Indonesian students' schema, rhetorical structures, and <b>cultural</b> <b>conventions</b> in seminars conducted in Indonesian differ from the Australian students' schema, rhetorical structures, and <b>cultural</b> <b>conventions</b> in seminars conducted in English. (iv) The equivalent discourse markers across the four groups have the same functions. (v) Indonesian students used more signposts in their presentations in English {{than the rest of the}} groups. The report of the study is presented in nine sections as shown below. Section A presents the introduction, review of the related literature, and methodology. Section B presents findings of the Indonesian data in Indonesian. Section C presents findings of the Australian data in English. Section D compares the findings of the Indonesian data in Indonesian and the Australian data in English. Section E presents the findings of the Indonesian data in English. Section F compares the findings between: i) the Indonesian data in Indonesian and the Indonesian data in English; and ii) the Indonesian data in English and the Australian data in English.
