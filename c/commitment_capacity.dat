Uncon-ditionally secure bit commitment can be based, in particular, on noisy channel or correlation where noise considered a valuable resource. Recently, Winter, Nascimento and Imai introduced the concept of <b>commitment</b> <b>capacity,</b> the maximal ratio between {{the length of a}} string which the sender commits to and the number of times the noisy channel/correlation is used. They also proved that for any discrete memoryless channel there exists a secure protocol achieving its <b>commitment</b> <b>capacity</b> however, no particular construction was given. Solving their open question, we provide an efficient protocol for achieving the <b>commitment</b> <b>capacity</b> of discrete memoryless systems (noisy channels and correlations). I...|$|E

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} explain the pattern of {{delegation}} to independent regulatory agencies in Western Europe. Two types of arguments are advanced to explain variations in the formal independence of regulators. Firstly, the need for governments to increase their credible <b>commitment</b> <b>capacity</b> may lead them to delegate regulation to an agency that is partly beyond their direct control. Secondly, delegation may be {{a response to the}} political uncertainty problem, which arises when governments are afraid of being replaced by another coalition with different preferences, which could decide to change existing policy choices. In addition, veto players may constitute a functional equivalent of delegation, since they influence policy stability and therefore tend to mitigate both the credibility and the political uncertainty problems. These arguments are consistent with the results of the empirical analysis of the formal independence of regulators in seventeen countries and seven sectors...|$|E

While only a few such authorities existed in Europe in the early 1980 s, {{by the end of}} the twentieth century they had spread impressively across countries and sectors. The analysis finds that three classes of factors (bottom-up, top-down, and horizontal) explain this trend. First, the establishment of independent regulatory agencies was an attempt to improve credible <b>commitment</b> <b>capacity</b> when liberalizing and privatizing utilities and to alleviate the political uncertainty problem, namely, the risk to a government that its policies will be changed when it loses power. Second, Europeanization favored the creation of independent regulators. Third, individual decisions were interdependent, as governments were influenced by the decisions of others in an emulation process where the symbolic properties of independent regulators mattered more than the functions they performed...|$|E
40|$|Many {{economists and}} policy analysts {{seem to believe}} that loyalty-rewarding pricing schemes, like {{frequent}} flyer programs, tend to reinforce firms' market power and hence are detrimental to consumer welfare. The existing academic literature has supported this view to some extent. In contrast, we argue that these programs are business stealing devices that tend to enhance competition, in the sense of generating lower average transaction prices and higher consumer surplus. In highly competitive environments this result is robust to alternative specifications of the firm' commitment power and demand structures. However, it could be reversed if the number of firms is sufficiently small and if firms are restricted to use program designs with sufficiently weak <b>commitment</b> <b>capacity.</b> © 2006 Elsevier B.

Consequently, intergovernmental attempts to normalise modes of integrated urban water management (such as WSUD) need to include innovative and flexible mechanisms that are responsivle to the dynamics of municipal <b>commitment</b> and <b>capacity.</b> These principles have broader application to cities internationally where the management of urban stormwater is the shared responsibility of multiple governments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} a firm’s external financial environment and the feature of its investment projects on the firm’s boundary and ownership structure.

Trading the costs of full ownership with those of a partial ownership through joint financing, which depend on the external financial environment, large firms in a developed financial environment optimally choose to a full ownership of less risky R&D projects. In an underdeveloped financial environment, however, joint ownership is often too costly to be chosen regardless the risk level of R&D projects...|$|E

40|$|Building a {{long-term}} relationship by committing to source from a single supplier over time may place a buyer at a disadvantage. With commitment, the buyer foregoes the option of switching to a new supplier, which is beneficial if the efficiency improvement {{is greater than the}} associated costs of switching. On the other hand, competition among suppliers may increase if the buyer commits to source from the winning supplier over a long term, which is advantageous for the buyer. We consider the value of commitment in an environment where the supplier operates capacity that is owned by the buyer, the buyer faces uncertainty about the downstream market demand, and a supplier’s production cost is private information. The buyer thus uses buffer capacity to hedge against market uncertainty and a competitive bidding process to elicit a supplier’s cost. We analyze when the buyer should commit to source from a single supplier over a long term, and show that there exists a critical level of switching costs above which the buyer should commit to a single supplier. Furthermore, we find that with <b>commitment,</b> <b>capacity</b> can be either higher or lower than without commitment. Finally, we find that when market uncertainty increases, commitment is optimal over a wider range of switching costs. 1 1...|$|E

To define its role during the hematopoietic lineage commitment, we silenced c-Myb in human CD 34 + hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Noteworthy, c-myb silencing increased the <b>commitment</b> <b>capacity</b> towards the macrophage and megakaryocyte lineages, while erythroid differentiation was impaired, {{as demonstrated by}} clonogenic assay, morphological and immunophenotypic data. Gene expression profiling and computational analysis of promoter regions of genes modulated in c-Myb-silenced CD 34 + cells identified the {{transcription factor}}s KLF 1 and LMO 2 as putative targets which can account for c-Myb knockdown effects. Indeed, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that c-Myb binds to KLF 1 and LMO 2 promoters and transactivates their expression. Consistently, the retroviral vector-mediated overexpression of either KLF 1 or LMO 2 partially rescued the defect in erythropoiesis caused by c-Myb silencing, while only KLF 1 was also able to repress the megakaryocyte differentiation enhanced in Myb-silenced CD 34 + cells. Our data collectively demonstrate that c-Myb plays {{a pivotal role in}} human primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells lineage commitment, by enhancing erythropoiesis at the expense of megakaryocyte diffentiation.

We propose a simple model to investigate the circumstances under which coordination {{may or may not be}} desirable. The model focuses on the design of stabilization policies in the presence of demand and supply shocks. It assumes that fiscal policy is the exclusive responsibility of governments trading off the variability of deficits against output variability and, possibly, variability in inflation. Monetary policy is delegated to the ECB, which trades off price stability against fluctuations in the interest rate (its policy instrument). We compare a non-cooperative scenario with fiscal coordination. We further distinguish between the fiscal authorities jointly playing Nash against the ECB (a proxy of ex-post coordination) and them acting as Stackelberg leaders against the ECB (a proxy of ex-ante coordination). Fiscal coordination may be counterproductive because of the adverse reaction of the ECB to the coordination efforts of the governments. Coordination is most likely to be beneficial when shocks are asymmetric because union-wide aggregates are only mildly affected, which leads to a passive monetary policy. Ex-ante coordination is more desirable because it presupposes a <b>commitment</b> <b>capacity</b> that helps the governments to acquire a strategic leadership position against the central bank...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the involvement of}} informally housed communities in shaping local government policies aimed at poverty alleviation. Involving the poor {{in the design of}} anti-poverty policies at local level is regarded as an invaluable opportunity that should be used by municipal governments to make poverty alleviation efforts more demand-driven and therefore more relevant to the people they are meant to benefit. The argument is that because the poor know about poverty first-hand, they would {{be in a position to}} revive local government's capacity to respond effectively to their needs. But this does not come without a price. Because of the complexity of public management, participative democracy is liable to slow down the process of governance. It may also become advantageous to the interests of some people or groups of people at the expense of others if attention is not paid to the representation and consideration of all the voices in the community–to name two drawbacks. For this reason, it is essential to the realization of an effective bottom-up approach to anti-poverty policy-making that certain conditions are in existence and practical issues of involvement are worked through. Accordingly, it is the intention of this study to focus on two particular areas (conditions and practical issues that would facilitate the process of involving informally housed communities in the design of local government policies that affect their lives), which are investigated with particular reference to the South African context. Drawing upon a series of field surveys and a broad selection of relevant works of scholars from both the international and local scene, the picture that emerges is that there needs to be a proper level of government's <b>commitment,</b> <b>capacity</b> and legally binding responsibility coupled with a healthy degree of community's motivation, ability and organizational capacity in order to involve the poor in local governance efficiently. The study has also found that there needs to be proper forms of involvement (the most relevant of which are identified as an ombudsman, public meetings and residents' committees) that are to be employed with attention to such issues as stakeholders to be engaged, degree of participation, timing of involvement and topics for which public debate may be sought.
