2500|$|Control action - The {{mathematical}} model and practical loop above both use a [...] "direct" [...] control action {{for all the}} terms, which means an increasing positive error results in an increasing positive <b>control</b> <b>output</b> for the summed terms to apply correction. However, the output is called [...] "reverse" [...] acting if it's necessary to apply negative corrective action. For instance, if the valve in the flow loop was 100-0% valve opening for 0-100% <b>control</b> <b>output</b> - meaning the controller action has to be reversed. Some process control schemes and final control elements require this reverse action. An example would be a valve for cooling water, where the fail safe mode, {{in the case of}} loss of signal, would be 100% opening of the valve; therefore 0% controller output needs to cause 100% valve opening.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} two walking controllers for a planar biped robot with unactuated point feet. The {{control is}} based on the tracking of reference motions expressed as a function of time. First, the reference motions are adapted at each step {{in order to create a}} hybrid zero dynamic (HZD) system. Next, the stability of the walking gait under closed-loop control is evaluated with the linearization of the restricted Poincaré map of the HZD. When the <b>controlled</b> <b>outputs</b> are selected to be the actuated coordinates, most periodic walking gaits for this robot are unstable, that is, the eigenvalues of the linearized Poincaré map (ELPM) is larger than one. Therefore, two control strategies are explored to produce stable walking. The first strategy uses an event-based feedback controller to modify the ELPM and the second one {{is based on}} the choice of <b>controlled</b> <b>outputs.</b> The stability analysis show that, for the same robot and for the same reference trajectory, the stability of the walking (or ELPM) can be modified by some pertinent choices of <b>controlled</b> <b>outputs.</b> Moreover, by studying some walking characteristics of many stable cases, a necessary condition for stable walking is proposed. It is that the height of swing foot is nearly zero at the desired moment of impact. Based on this condition, the duration of the step is almost constant in presence of initial error, so a method for choosing <b>controlled</b> <b>outputs</b> for the second controller is given. By using this method, two stable domains for the <b>controlled</b> <b>outputs</b> selection are obtained...|$|R

50|$|Control for the {{solenoids}} and {{stepper motors}} {{can be either}} closed loop or open loop. Closed loop systems rely on feedback from a manifold pressure sensor to meet a predetermined boost pressure. Open loop systems have a predetermined <b>control</b> <b>output</b> where <b>control</b> <b>output</b> is merely based on other inputs such as throttle angle and/or engine RPM. Open loop specifically leaves out a desired boost level, while closed loop attempts to target a specific level of boost pressure. Since open loop systems do not modify control levels based on MAP sensor, differing boost pressure levels may be reached based on outside variables such as weather conditions or engine coolant temperature. For this reason, systems that do not feature closed loop operation are not as widespread.|$|E
