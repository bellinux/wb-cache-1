40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Energy (DOE) maintains millions of classified documents containing highly sensitive nuclear weapons design and production information. Allegations that the Peoples Republic of China obtained nuclear warhead designs from an employee of DOE's Los Alamos National Laboratory, {{as well as the}} disappearance of two computer hard drives containing highly sensitive weapons information from that same laboratory, have raised concerns about how effectively DOE protects classified information, particularly the most sensitive classified information that is contained in vaults and computer systems. DOE's security program consists of many strategies for protecting and controlling classified information, such as controlling access to classified information through physical and administrative barriers and determining whether a person's work requires a "need to know" the information. DOE has recently increased protection for top-secret documents by revising its <b>Classified</b> <b>Matter</b> Protection and Control Manual, which provides detailed requirements for the protection and control of <b>classified</b> <b>matter.</b> This report reviews the (1) extent to which DOE's Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories have implemented DOE's established access controls and need-to-know requirements for classified vaults and computer systems containing the most sensitive classified information as well as the adequacy of these requirements and (2) steps DOE is taking to upgrade the protection of its classified information. GAO found that the Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories have implemented DOE's access controls and need-to-know requirements for both vaults and classified computer systems containing the most sensitive classified information. However, DOE's requirements for documenting need to know lack specificity, allowing laboratory managers wide variations in interpretation and implementation and.

The purpose of this report is to present the results of the search for relevant classified information. There are two <b>classified</b> <b>matter</b> control centers operated by two prime contractors at the Hanford Site. One is operated by Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) and the other is operated by Westinghouse Hanford Company (WHC).

40|$|The {{search for}} {{security}} against spies, saboteurs, and other disaffected persons {{has led to}} the creation of elaborate programs for the surveillance of federal employees. The same considerations require protective measures among those who, nominally in private employment, produce or develop secret weapons for the military establishment. Thus the Department of Defense requires clearance of defense contractors and their employees before they may have access to classified materials; and the Atomic Energy Commission has a statutory mandate to investigate the 2 ̆ 2 character, associations, and loyalty, 2 ̆ 2 of those to whom it entrusts 2 ̆ 2 restricted data. 2 ̆ 2 But neither of these martial agencies exercises as much sway over the livelihood of private citizens as does the United States Coast Guard. Better known for its unceasing attention to wrecks, buoys, and icebergs, since the Korean War the Coast Guard has been charged with weeding out security risks from among seamen and waterfront workers. More than half a million Americans have met the test. What is striking is that the seemingly small number found wanting—some 2, 500 —is probably greater than the toll of victims of any other loyalty or security program. Also striking is the lack of public attention that this aspect of the Port Security Program, as it is called, has attracted. This inattention becomes truly remarkable in view of the Program 2 ̆ 7 s impact: denial of clearance to a seaman bars him altogether from practicing his calling. In this respect the Port Security Program is unique; for though other federal security programs affecting private employment may have the practical effect of excluding a man from his vocation, no other one purports to do so; they are framed in terms of access to <b>classified</b> <b>matter,</b> and the world of unclassified employment is presumably still open to the reject...|$|E

40|$|The Kosa School in China is {{a school}} of the Hinayana Buddhism, the thought of {{which is based on}} Vasubandhu’s Abhidharma-kosa. This school has great {{influence}} on various schools of Chinese Buddhism. And the practitioners of Kosa are called ‘Teachers of Kosa’. The main doctrine of teachers of Kosa is that all physical and mental phenomena are made up of conditions, thus there is no permanent and independent existence. This theory goes against the theories of substance and self of the Tīrthika Schools. The Kosa School <b>classifies</b> <b>matter,</b> mind and other forms of existences into 5 sets and 75 elements. They further assert that although these elements are indivisible, they are subject to conditions for arising and fading out. Current existence arises and the past existence fades out, and this is the process of all phenomena. Things arising must have conditions causing it to arise, therefore they have the doctrines of the ‘six causes’, ‘four conditions’, and ‘five effects’ etc, implying that all phenomena arise according to causes and conditions and cannot exist independently. There is neither permanent and independent existence nor any substance or self of things. This school builds its theory on the notion of ‘elements exist while the self of every phenomenon does not exist’ and establishes two categories of causes and effects, namely, the ‘youlou’ (maculate) and the ‘wulou’ (immaculate). This thesis tries to collect the research works of modern scholars on the topic of the Kosa, expose the theoretical framework of the Kosa, and explain its theories of time, no-self and Vasubandhu’s view on karma.

40|$|We {{show that}} in F-theory GUTs, a natural {{explanation}} of flavor hierarchies in the quark and lepton sector requires a single point of E 8 enhancement in the internal geometry, from which all Yukawa couplings originate.

40|$|One of {{the goals}} of current {{research}} in medical ultrasound is to develop techniques to quantitatively differentiate between tissue types and tissue states {{on the basis of the}} changes in the backscattered signal caused by differences in the elastic properties of the tissues under study. In this dissertation, we proposed to <b>classify</b> white <b>matter</b> and gray matter of adult brain tissues. The first step in this investigation was to develop a linear dichotomizer for the classification of white matter and gray matter using a power spectrum eigenvector approach with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The LDA classifier is described in Chapter 4. The successful classification rates for pure white matter and pure gray matter tissues were 99 % using the LDA. When the LDA was used in transition regions the successful classification rates for both type of tissues dropped to 56 %. We concluded that the weakness with this classification scheme was that it did not exploit the information at different scales. In order to overcome this weakness, two multiscale classification methods were developed in Chapter 5, a power spectrum eigenvector approach with Wavelet transform-Linear Discriminant Analysis (WLDA) and a power spectrum eigenvector approach with Wavelet transform-Artificial Neural Network (WANN). Both methods were tested on calibrated media, also known as tissue mimicking phantoms, as well as on synthetically generated media. The data from synthetically generated media were obtained by a three Dimensional Finite Difference Time Domain method (3 D FDTD). Both multiscale classification methods performed as well as the LDA method in <b>classifying</b> pure white <b>matter</b> and pure gray matter but they performed better than the LDA in transition regions.
