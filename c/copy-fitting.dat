40|$|The author {{presents}} here four findings {{drawn from}} close {{analysis of the}} chapter and book divisions in Caxtonâ€™s edition of Le Morte Darthur. The first three of these bear particular relevance to scholars interested in textual alterations {{that might have been}} made to Le Morte Darthur for <b>copy-fitting</b> purposes. In particular, these results suggest closer attention might usefully be paid to the text at interlinear chapter divisions, and in quires a-d and ee, as the extreme contraction of formatting at these points suggests that there may be associated textual contractions. The last finding provides circumstantial support for the view that Caxton revised the Roman War section, and further indicates that there is some probability that this section was set from a different exemplar {{to the rest of the}} edition. Most of all, though, it is hoped that this study has demonstrated how much we might still be able to learn about techniques of the early hand-press period, even from a text as persistently studied as Le Morte Darthur...|$|E
