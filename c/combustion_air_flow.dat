40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} focus upon composing recommendations with respect to burners design while observing aerodynamic, together with present and advanced developments {{in the field of}} flame technology principles. Specifically the aims are set at flame stability and pollutions. Important part of this paper is a novel design procedure dealing with premixed burners. Further, by exploiting the results of testing program enabled one to design burners exhibiting low level of nitrogen oxides emissions. On the basis of aerodynamic analysis of premixed burners flow path several recommendations on the geometry resulted in proposing two ejectors, which transport the <b>combustion</b> <b>air.</b> In the first ejector the fuel jet, generated by flow through a nozzle, draws the specified part of the <b>combustion</b> <b>air,</b> and then the mixture is a driving agent of the second ejector. The remaining part of <b>combustion</b> <b>air</b> <b>flows</b> first through the radial curved vanes, and second its tangential velocity component is augmented by axial vanes prior it enters mixing part of the second ejector. For the additional contribution to the rotating motion the inclined axial vanes built inside the nozzle of the second ejector are responsible. The resulting swirling number reaches the values up to 2. 6. For the burner so arranged fire stability and low NOx emissions in the wide operating conditions can be expected. Within the frame of extensive testing program in the field of diffusion burners several modifications have been carried out such as setting of axial vanes which secure the swirling motion, changes of <b>combustion</b> <b>air</b> <b>flows</b> path, and modifications of secondary nozzles, these resulted in extending zone of stabilized flame and reducing the formation of NOx, e. g.

This study investigates the performance of and emissions from a Helrnholtz-type pulse combustor with varying parameters such as gas input rate, tailpipe length, combustion chamber volume and composition I) f the natural gas being used as a fuel.

40|$|Combustion {{of fixed}} fuel beds in grate {{furnaces}} {{is one of}} the most common techniques within production of heat and power from solid fuels. The grate furnace used to be a working horse for combustion of hard coal, while today the incitement of using renewable fuel sources has turned biomass and municipal waste into dominating fuel types. These fuels are more conveniently managed by the robust grate furnace than by, for example, fluidised bed or suspension boilers. However, the introduction of the, in many cases, complicated and heterogeneous biomass and waste fuels have, while at the same time subjected to increasingly stringent demands on efficiency and emission of harmful substances, given rise to diffuse challenges to the operation and design of grate furnaces. The influence of the heterogeneous fuels and the low air flow rate required for low nitric oxide emissions are, to a large extent, unclear. The outcome is that different furnaces not only rely on diverging strategies of design and operation â€“ they also show a variety of disturbance characteristics. To make way for more efficient use of modern biomass fuels in grate furnaces, by improving the understanding of the combustion situation and disturbance characteristics, the following steps were made in this study: (1) a set of grate furnaces were investigated separating hands-on problems from underlying research oriented questions, (2) three methods for detecting and measuring disturbances in grate furnaces were developed, and (3) the fundamentals behind disturbances in the part of a fuel bed of grate furnace dominated by char conversion were addressed by mathematical modelling. The outcome of the inventory of furnaces is that fuel-bed channelling and grate material deterioration are common â€“ the first causing increased emissions of unburned carbon compounds and nitric oxides, while the latter giving rise to high material costs and operation failures. In some furnaces, the disturbances could be detected by logical reasoning and visual observations while abated by hands-on adjustments to the fuel handling, operation conditions or grate design. The continued study adds two instruments to further improve this category: (1) a method of video recording inside furnaces to detect, quantify and fend off disturbing channelling, and (2) a new method of on-line monitoring of the fuel moisture content to detect disturbing changes in fuel moisture content during operation. Furthermore, a third developed method of analysing the residence time field of the gas flow in a furnace by mathematical modelling provides an opportunity to optimise the furnace chamber for both steady conditions and transient disturbances. The inventory of furnaces also identified some fundamental question marks concerning the conversion of the fuel bed â€“ how channels in the fuel bed arise and how these disturbances may be avoided, also during low <b>combustion</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow,</b> without causing grate-material deterioration. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling of two-dimensional conversion of a fixed char bed was developed and used for investigating these matters, in which it was confirmed that a provoked change of bed porosity may cause process disturbing channelling. An obvious solution to avoid bed-channelling is, therefore, to create an as homogeneous fuel bed as possible. However, the structure of the fuel bed may only to a certain extent be affected; the low cost of the inferior quality fuel is, to a large extent, attributable to the fact that it is heterogeneous and, furthermore, advanced fuel pre-treatments drastically reduce the economical outcome. Thus, the most powerful parameter to avoid disturbances in a heterogeneous fuel bed is to manipulate the distribution of air by means of grate design. Here, a considerable flow resistance across the grate â€“ an effect which may be achieved by reducing the amount and/or size of the air holes in the grate rods â€“ was found to dampen channelling. The CFD modelling, however, indicates that the placing or shaping of these holes, under certain circumstances during the char conversion, may cause thermal and/or carburizing material deterioration â€“ one of the most common disturbances in the inventory of furnaces. Consequently, recommendations for placing of holes along the lower part of a combustion grate, counter-acting the risk of grate material deterioration, could be given from the modelling outcome. These recommendations, which also include recirculation of flue-gases into the combustion air, may in a straight forward manner be applied to the design of future grate furnaces to improve the combustion of heterogeneous fuel beds...|$|E
40|$|General Electric (GE) has {{developed}} an approach whereby native mercury reduction on fly ash can be improved by optimizing the combustion system. This approach eliminates carbon-rich areas in the combustion zone, making the combustion process more uniform, and allows increasing carbon content in fly ash without significant increase in CO emissions. Since boiler excess O{sub 2 } can be also reduced {{as a result of}} optimized combustion, this process reduces NO{sub x} emissions. Because combustion optimization improves native mercury reduction on fly ash, it can reduce requirements for activated carbon injection (ACI) when integrated with sorbent injection for more efficient mercury control. The approach can be tailored to specific unit configurations and coal types for optimal performance. This report describes results of a U. S. DOE sponsored project designed to evaluate the effect of combustion conditions on 'native' mercury capture on fly ash and integrate combustion optimization for improved mercury and NO{sub x} reduction with ACI. The technology evaluation took place in Lee Station Unit 3 located in Goldsboro, NC and operated by Progress Energy. Unit 3 burns a low-sulfur Eastern bituminous coal and is a 250 MW opposed-wall fired unit equipped with an ESP with a specific collection area of 249 ft{sup 2 }/kacfm. Unit 3 is equipped with SO{sub 3 } injection for ESP conditioning. The technical goal of the project was to evaluate the technology's ability to achieve 70 % mercury reduction below the baseline emission value of 2. 9 lb/TBtu, which was equivalent to 80 % mercury reduction relative to the mercury concentration in the coal. The strategy to achieve the 70 % incremental improvement in mercury removal in Unit 3 was (1) to enhance 'naturally' occurring fly ash mercury capture by optimizing the combustion process and using duct humidification to reduce flue gas temperatures at the ESP inlet, and (2) to use ACI in front of the ESP to further reduce mercury emissions. The program was comprised of field and pilot-scale tests, engineering studies and consisted of eight tasks. As part of the program, GE conducted pilot-scale evaluation of sorbent effect on mercury reduction, supplied and installed adjustable riffle boxes to assist in combustion optimization, performed combustion optimization, supplied mobile sorbent injection and flue gas humidification systems, conducted CFD modeling of sorbent injection and flue gas humidification, and performed mercury testing including a continuous 30 -day sorbent injection trial. Combustion optimization was the first step in reduction of mercury emissions. Goals of combustion optimization activities were to improve 'native' mercury capture on fly ash and reduce NO{sub x}. Combustion optimization included balancing of coal flow through individual burners to eliminate zones of carbon-rich <b>combustion,</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> balancing, and burner adjustments. As part of the project, the original riffle boxes were replaced with Foster-Wheeler's adjustable riffle boxes to allow for biasing the coal flow between the coal pipes. A 10 -point CO/O{sub 2 }/NO{sub x} grid was installed in the primary superheater region of the back pass to assist in these activities. Testing of mercury emissions before and after combustion optimization demonstrated that mercury emissions were reduced from 2. 9 lb/TBtu to 1. 8 lb/TBtu due to boiler operation differences in conjunction with combustion optimization, a 38 % improvement in 'native' mercury capture on fly ash. Native mercury reduction from coal was {approx} 42 % at baseline conditions and 64 % at optimized combustion conditions. As a result of combustion optimization NO{sub x} emissions were reduced by 18 %. A three-dimensional CFD model was developed to study the flow distribution and sorbent injection in the post air heater duct in Lee Station Unit 3. Modeling of the flow pattern exiting the air pre-heater demonstrated that because of the duct transition from a circular opening at the exit of air-pre-heater to a rectangular ESP inlet duct, flow separation occurred at the corners after the transition. Modeling also demonstrated that the flow was severely biased from the South side to the North side due to the bend of the duct. Results of CFD modeling were used to design lances for better sorbent distribution across the ESP inlet duct. Modeling of water injection demonstrated that because of flue gas temperature biasing, the droplet evaporation rate was slower on the North side than that on the South side of the duct. Modeling suggested that an improvement of water droplet evaporation could be achieved by closing the lance on the North side where flue gas temperatures were lower. Preliminary evaluation of the effect of carbon-based sorbents on mercury reduction took place in a 1 MBtu/hr (300 kW) Boiler Simulator Facility using the same coal as fired at Lee Station...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} an experimentally validated modelling {{study of the}} flow of combustion air in an industrial radiant tube burner (RTB). The RTB is used typically in industrial heat treating furnaces. The work has been initiated because of the need for improvements in burner lifetime and performance which are related to the fluid mechanics of the com busting flow, and a fundamental understanding of this is therefore necessary. To achieve this, a detailed three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model has been used, validated with experimental air flow, temperature and flue gas measurements. Initially, the work programme is presented and the theory behind RTB design and operation in addition to the theory behind swirling flows and methane combustion. NOx reduction techniques are discussed and numerical modelling of combusting flows is detailed in this section. The importance of turbulence, radiation and combustion modelling is highlighted, as well as the numerical schemes that incorporate discretization, finite volume theory and convergence. The study first focuses on the <b>combustion</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> and its delivery to the combustion zone. An isothermal computational model was developed to allow the examination of the flow characteristics as it enters the burner and progresses through the various sections prior to the discharge face in the combustion area. Important features identified include the air recuperator swirler coil, the step ring, the primary/secondary air splitting flame tube and the fuel nozzle. It was revealed that the effectiveness of the air recuperator swirler is significantly compromised by the need for a generous assembly tolerance. Also, there is a substantial circumferential flow maldistribution introduced by the swirier, but that this is effectively removed by the positioning of a ring constriction in the downstream passage. Computations using the k-Îµ turbulence model show good agreement with experimentally measured velocity profiles in the combustion zone and proved the use of the modelling strategy prior to the combustion study. Reasonable mesh independence was obtained with 200, 000 nodes. Agreement was poorer with the RNGÂ  k-Îµ and Reynolds Stress models. The study continues to address the combustion process itself and the heat transfer process internal to the RTB. A series of combustion and radiation model configurations were developed and the optimum combination of the Eddy Dissipation (ED) combustion model and the Discrete Transfer (DT) radiation model was used successfully to validate a burner experimental test. The previously cold flow validated k-Îµ turbulence model was used and reasonable mesh independence was obtained with 300, 000 nodes. The combination showed good agreement with temperature measurements in the inner and outer walls of the burner, as well as with flue gas composition measured at the exhaust. The inner tube wall temperature predictions validated the experimental measurements in the largest portion of the thermocouple locations, highlighting a small flame bias to one side, although the model slightly over predicts the temperatures towards the downstream end of the inner tube. NOx emissions were initially over predicted, however, the use of a combustion flame temperature limiting subroutine allowed convergence to the experimental value of 451 ppmv. With the validated model, the effectiveness of certain RTB features identified previously is analysed, and an analysis of the energy transfers throughout the burner is presented, to identify the dominant mechanisms in each region. The optimum turbulence-combustion-radiation model selection was then the baseline for further model development. One of these models, an eccentrically positioned flame tube model highlights the failure mode of the RTB during long term operation. Other models were developed to address NOx reduction and improvement of the flame profile in the burner combustion zone. These included a modified fuel nozzle design, with 12 circular section fuel ports, which demonstrates a longer and more symmetric flame, although with limited success in NOx reduction. In addition, a zero bypass swirler coil model was developed that highlights the effect of the stronger swirling combustion flow. A reduced diameter and a 20 mm forward displaced flame tube model shows limited success in NOx reduction; although the latter demonstrated improvements in the discharge face heat distribution and improvements in the flame symmetry. Finally, Flue Gas Recirculation (FGR) modelling attempts indicate the difficulty of the application of this NOx reduction technique in the Wellman RTB. Recommendations for further work are made that include design mitigations for the fuel nozzle and further burner modelling is suggested to improve computational validation. The introduction of fuel staging is proposed, as well as a modification in the inner tube to enhance the effect of FGR...|$|E
30|$|In {{the field}} of <b>combustion,</b> the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate plays a number of {{important}} roles; primarily providing a cushion of air which the bed will sit upon as well as mixing the bed material. This high mixing is the key factor in achieving a uniform combustion temperature {{as well as in the}} oxidation of combustion materials. In practice, the expansion of the bed materials in the combustor is almost controlled and limited by the pressure drop across the bed. Therefore, the hydrodynamic properties such as the bed pressure drop and minimum fluidization velocity are the most important parameters studied in the numerical modelling of fluidized beds. To achieve and maintain a stable fluidization, knowledge about the pressure drop across the bed and minimum fluidization velocity of the gas flow introduced from the bottom of the bed are required. Therefore the minimum fluidization air velocity to fluidize the sand particles and pressure drop are crucial hydrodynamic parameters for analysing the operation and design of fluidized bed combustors. The minimum fluidization velocity was determined experimentally by measuring the pressure drop through the bed of particles. The pressure drop is defined as the difference of absolute pressure under the bed to that of the area above the bed which is called the freeboard [16, 17].|$|R

40|$|To avoid extreme {{temperatures}} and reducing conditions along combustion grate surfaces {{reducing the risk}} of grate material deterioration-the configuration and out-placing of air passages through a grate have been investigated by mathematical modeling. In the two-dimensional CFD-simulations of wood-char combustion On top of the grate, the number and width of the air passages through the grate were varied. The different grate configurations were further investigated for different air flux rates and for the recirculation of flue gases to the <b>combustion</b> <b>air.</b> The results of the simulation; show that the maximal temperature in the grate is sensitive to the amount of air fed to the bed and,,at constant <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate, to the entering velocity of the <b>combustion</b> <b>air</b> to the fuel bed. The possibility of using the <b>air</b> <b>flow,</b> as a control parameter in modern grate :Furnaces is limited, due to a general wish to reduce the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> through the grate to reduce nitric oxide emissions. Extreme temperatures in the grate should, therefore, according to the modelin;, be avoided by making sure that the entering velocity of the air to the Fuel bed is sufficiently high. Practically, this can be achieved by reducing the number of passages in the grate, or by introducing flue-gas recycling. However, to avoid areas of reducing conditio as along the grate, the number of passages should not be reduced further than resulting in a maximal distance of 4 - 5 cm between them, when working with pure air...|$|R
