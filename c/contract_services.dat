2500|$|Brazil’s public {{research}} institutes {{and universities}} follow rigid rules {{that tend to}} make them difficult to manage. States may opt {{to develop their own}} research institutes and university systems but, as all laws and regulations are adopted at federal level, they all have to follow the same rules and regulations. Thus, they all come up against the same hurdles. These include extensive bureaucratic structures, an obligation to recruit staff, academic or otherwise, from among public servants, analogous career ladders and salary systems, an irregular flow of funds, overly complex procurement procedures and powerful unions in the civil service. A structural alternative was developed in 1998, with the creation of social organizations. These private, non-profit entities manage public research facilities under contract to federal agencies. They have the autonomy to hire (or fire) staff, <b>contract</b> <b>services,</b> buy equipment, choose the topics and objectives of scientific or technological research and sign research contracts with private companies.
