5|$|Although the {{importance}} of The Slave Community was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's <b>conclusions,</b> methodology, and sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to exclude the more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his <b>conclusions</b> at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition of The Slave Community. Despite criticisms, The Slave Community is a foundational text {{in the study of}} the life and culture of slaves in the antebellum South.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{surveys have}} found {{evidence}} that Native Americans used the immediate vicinity of Yucca Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis. Some Native Americans disagree with the <b>conclusions</b> of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They believe that these <b>conclusions</b> overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact.|$|E

5|$|Many of Poe's <b>conclusions,</b> however, are {{speculative}} {{due to his}} {{rejection of}} analytic logic and emphasis on intuition and inspiration. Further, Eureka contains many scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions opposed Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets. He also says that Johannes Kepler came to his <b>conclusions</b> not through science but through guesswork. For this reason, {{it has been suggested}} that what Poe demands is true in Eureka is not actually about this universe, but a parallel fictitious one Poe creates. If this is the case, as interpreted by poet Richard Wilbur, Poe is criticizing this world, suggesting it has fallen away from God by elevating scientific reason above poetic intuition.|$|E

It would be self-contradictory to assert the premises and deny the <b>conclusion,</b> because the negation of the <b>conclusion</b> is contradictory to {{the truth of the}} premises.|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} on property induction {{were conducted to}} explore whether an incoherent premise discounted the believability of the <b>conclusion</b> when there were two premises. In all three experiments, a single premise increased or decreased {{the likelihood of the}} <b>conclusion</b> depending on the nature of explanatory coherence of a premise and a <b>conclusion.</b> However, when there were two premises, one that shared the reason with the <b>conclusion</b> (coherent premise), and one that does not (incoherent premise), the believability of the <b>conclusion</b> was affected differently in three experiments. When two premises and the <b>conclusion</b> were presented simultaneously in Experiment 1, the believability of the <b>conclusion</b> was increased. That is, an incoherent premise did not seem to affect the believability of the <b>conclusion</b> as much as the coherent premise. The incoherent premise seemed to decrease the believability of the <b>conclusion</b> a little bit when the two premises and the <b>conclusion</b> were presented sequentially so that each premise was not ignored in Experiment 2. The incoherent premise decreased the believability of the <b>conclusion</b> below the baseline condition in Experiment 3, where participants were asked to write down reasons for each premise being true. Results of three experiments suggested that only the confirming evidences were processed under natural conditions. A few possible theoretical implications were considered...|$|R

5|$|The Air Force's 1997 {{rejection}} of re-engining was subsequently disputed in a Defense Science Board (DSB) report in 2003.

Criticizing the Air Force cost analysis, the DSB found that among other things, the Air Force failed to account for the cost of aerial refueling; the DSB estimated that refueling in the air cost $17.50 per gallon, whereas the Air Force had failed to account for the cost of fuel delivery and so had only priced fuel at $1.20 per gallon.|$|E
5|$|The Minister {{had decided}} that the Jehovah's Witnesses' {{doctrine}} prohibiting its adherents from taking part in military service was contrary to national security and, thus, to public order and the public interest.

The appellants had not shown that the Minister had based his <b>conclusions</b> on false or unfounded facts; thus, unless the <b>conclusions</b> were irrelevant, the Court could not interfere with the Minister's opinion since his discretionary power had been exercised within statutory limitations.|$|E
