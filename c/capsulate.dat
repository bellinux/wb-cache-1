40|$|Two {{pairs of}} {{isogenic}} <b>capsulate</b> and noncapsulate and {{one pair of}} <b>capsulate</b> fimbriate and nonfimbriate strains of Haemophilus influenzae type b were studied in an organ culture of human respiratory mucosa. Over 24 h, the numbers of recovered bacteria increased from the original inoculum size of 10 (5) to 10 (8) CFU/ml. Transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed that noncapsulate organisms caused significant epithelial damage, whereas <b>capsulate</b> strains did not. Association of noncapsulate bacteria with damaged epithelial cells was observed by 14 h of incubation. In contrast, <b>capsulate</b> organisms were associated with a dense, thick, gel-like matrix which was observed above the epithelial surface. These <b>capsulate</b> organisms were not seen to associate with the epithelial surface (by transmission electron microscopy), though they were occasionally seen adhering to cells by scanning electron microscopy. Fimbriate <b>capsulate</b> H. influenzae showed increased adherence to buccal cells compared with nonfimbriate <b>capsulate</b> organisms. There was also association of fimbriate <b>capsulate</b> bacteria with damaged organ culture epithelium in one of four experiments. It is concluded that both capsule and fimbriae affect the interaction of H. influenzae with human airway mucosa in vitro by influencing adherence to and damage of the epithelium...|$|E
40|$|Seventeen {{geographically}} distinct isolates of Lactococcus garvieae, {{isolated from}} diseased fish, were compared serologically using antiserum raised against the various isolates in rainbow trout. Sera raised against a capsule deficient isolate did not agglutinate <b>capsulated</b> isolates, regardless of origin. In contrast, all antisera raised against <b>capsulated</b> isolates cross reacted strongly with non-capsulated isolates. Antisera raised against <b>capsulated</b> Japanese isolates cross reacted with other <b>capsulated</b> Japanese isolates including isolates from geographically distinct prefectures within Japan (Ehime and Oita). However, antisera against these virulent <b>capsulated</b> isolates did not cross react with European <b>capsulated</b> isolates. Antisera raised against European <b>capsulated</b> isolates cross reacted with other European isolates, regardless of origin within Europe (UK, Italy, Spain), {{but did not}} cross-react with Japanese <b>capsulated</b> isolates. Agglutination assays performed {{with a range of}} fifteen lectins revealed differences in surface carbohydrate structure: capsule deficient isolates agglutinated with concanavalin A, Ricinis communis agglutinin, Pisum sativum agglutinin, Lens culinaris agglutinin, wheat germ agglutinin and succinylated wheat germ agglutinin. European <b>capsulated</b> isolates agglutinated with concanavalin A only. The Japanese <b>capsulated</b> isolates were not agglutinated by any of the lectins used in this study. Representative isolates from each group (Japanese <b>capsulated</b> and non-capsulated, European <b>capsulated</b> and non-capsulated) were investigated for their ability to fix complement. Non-capsulated isolates fixed complement regardless of origin, and antibody did not markedly enhance complement fixation. In contrast, the <b>capsulated</b> isolates were less efficient at fixing complement, but complement fixation was markedly increased by homologous antibody. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Summary. The {{ability of}} {{antibodies}} to cell-surface components of Klebsiella to increase surface hydrophobicity {{and to gain}} access to antigens potentially masked by the capsule was investigated. Treatment of <b>capsulate</b> or non-capsulate strains with the respective autologous antiserum resulted in a marked increase in surface hydropho-bicity. Antisera raised against a rough non-capsulate (K- 0 -) strain had little effect on the surface hydrophobicity of either of the <b>capsulate</b> strains K 1 + 01 + and K 2 + 0 1 +, or of the non-capsulate K- 01 ' strain. Whereas anti-K- 01 ' sera or anti-K 2 ' sera increased the surface hydrophobicity of the K 2 ' 01 ' strain, only antisera containing anti-Kl+ antibodies increased the hydrophobicity of the K 1 ' 01 ' strain. Immunoadsorption of anti-K- 0 1 + serum by whole <b>capsulate</b> cells revealed that neither the Kl nor the K 2 capsular polysaccharide acted as a barrier to anti- 0 antibodies but that the K 1 capsular polysaccharide masked the presence of the immunoglobulin at the cell surface. The Klebsiella capsular polysaccharide does not appear to present a permeability barrier to immunoglobulins although failure to detect outer-membrane proteins in the immune complexes of either of the <b>capsulate</b> strains or of the K- 01 ' strain suggests that the 0 antigen may prevent access of antibodies to these antigens...|$|E

The <b>capsulate</b> strain was fourfold less adherent to the macrophage surface after cold incubation, although adherence of both strains was significantly increased after opsonization with nonimmune C 5 -depleted serum. When opsonized inocula were adjusted so that they adhered to macrophages in equal numbers, the two strains were internalized at equivalent rates and both entered membrane-bound compartments (phagosomes). Colocalization of bacteria with the late endosomal and lysosomal marker lysosome-associated membrane protein revealed that fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes containing the <b>capsulate</b> organism was significantly reduced 10 and 30 min after entry, but by 1 h, no difference between the strains was observed. Once internalized, meningococci were effectively killed, although more rapid killing of the <b>capsulate</b> strain was observed over the first 3 h. These results indicate that the (alpha 2 [...] > 8) -linked polysialic acid capsule modifies the interaction of meningococci with human macrophages at multiple steps, including adherence to the macrophage surface and phagosome-lysosome fusion. Moreover, the discordance between the kinetics of phagosome- lysosome fusion and bacterial killing suggests that a nonlysosomal mechanism may be responsible for a significant fraction of macrophage killing of N. meningitidis...|$|E

40|$|Acanthamoeba polyphaga trophozoites bind yeast {{cells of}} Candida albicans {{isolates}} {{within a few}} hours, leaving few cells in suspension or still attached to trophozoite surfaces. The nature of yeast cell recognition, mediated by an acanthamoebal trophozoite mannose binding protein is confirmed by experiments utilizing concentration dependent mannose hapten blocking. Similarly, acapsulate cells of Cryptococcus neoformans are also bound within a relatively short timescale. However, even after protracted incubation many <b>capsulate</b> cells of Cryptococcus remain in suspension, suggesting that the <b>capsulate</b> cell form of this species is not predated by acanthamoebal trophozoites. Further aspects {{of the association of}} Acanthamoeba and fungi are apparent when studying their interaction with conidia of the biocontrol agent Coniothyrium minitans. Conidia which readily bind with increasing maturity of up to 42 days, were little endocytosed and even released. Cell and conidial surface mannose as determined by FITC-lectin binding, flow cytometry with associated ligand binding analysis and hapten blocking studies demonstrates the following phenomena. Candida isolates and acapsulate Cryptococcus expose most mannose, while <b>capsulate</b> Cryptococcus cells exhibit least exposure commensurate with yeast cellular binding or lack of trophozoites. Conidia of Coniothyrium, albeit in a localized fashion, also manifest surface mannose exposure but as shown by Bmax values, in decreasing amounts with increasing maturity. Contrastingly such conidia experience greater trophozoite binding with maturation, thereby questioning the primacy of a trophozoite mannose-binding-protein recognition model. ...|$|E

Clinically important <b>capsulate</b> gram-negative bacteria share a common organization of their capsulation loci, arguing convergence on a successful arrangement of genes.
