5|$|Although by tradition, Hastert was {{the leader}} of the House Republicans, he adopted a much lower profile in the media than <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> would suggest for a Speaker. This led to accusations that he was only a figurehead for DeLay. In 2005, DeLay was indicted by a Texas grand jury on charges of campaign-finance violations. DeLay stepped down as {{majority}} leader and was replaced in that post by Roy Blunt; DeLay resigned from Congress the following year.|$|E
5|$|After {{his service}} as governor, Wilkinson {{returned}} to his business pursuits. In the early 1990s, he began borrowing money to keep his bookstore business solvent and to support his lavish lifestyle. His interest in running for another non-consecutive term as governor appeared to be dampened by the system of public financing that Kentucky had in place at that time for gubernatorial elections. In 1995, he published his memoir entitled You Can't Do That, Governor!; a major theme of the book was his disdain for <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> and political norms. In 1999, he launched ECampus.com, an Internet book retailer. Among the investors in the company were Wendy's founder Dave Thomas, Long John Silver's founder James Patterson, and Ohio State University president William English Kirwan.|$|E

He amended the militia act to allow use of all {{available}} volunteers and ordered enhanced training of these raw recruits, despite opposition from the provincial legislature. He continued strengthening and reinforcing defences. Brock also began seeking out First Nations leaders, such as the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, to build alliances with him against the Americans in the event of war. Although the <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> of the day was that Canada would fall quickly {{in the event of an}} invasion, Brock pursued these strategies to give the colony a fighting chance.|$|E

5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{reject the}} idea that Hamlet is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son, Hamnet Shakespeare, who died in 1596 at age eleven. <b>Conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> holds that Hamlet is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time. However, Stephen Greenblatt {{has argued that the}} coincidence of the names and Shakespeare's grief for the loss of his son may {{lie at the heart of}} the tragedy. He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable.|$|E
5|$|The rampant and {{unsustainable}} hunting was {{not just}} financially motivated: it also had a more philosophical, fatalistic aspect. The <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> among New Zealand Europeans in the 19th century was that things colonial, whether they were plants, animals or people, were inferior to things European. It was widely assumed that the plants and animals of New Zealand's forest ecosystems would be quickly replaced by more vigorous and competitive European species. This assumption of inevitable doom led to a conclusion that the conservation of native biota was pointless and futile; Victorian collectors instead focused their efforts on acquiring a good range of specimens before the rare species disappeared altogether.|$|E
5|$|In the 1974 Daytona 200, after early leader Gary Nixon retired, Roberts battled for {{the lead}} with former 500cc world champion, Giacomo Agostini before an {{overheated}} engine forced him to settle for second place. In April 1974, Roberts ventured to Europe {{for the first time}} to compete in the prestigious mola 200 road race for 750cc motorcycles. He made a positive impression competing against the best road racers in the world, once again finishing second to Agostini. He then traveled to England with a team of American riders to compete against a British riding team in the 1974 Transatlantic Match races. The <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> at the time was that American riders, who competed mostly in dirt track races, could not race on asphalt at the same level as the British riders, who specialized in road racing events. Roberts dispelled any such notions by winning three of the six races and finishing second in the remaining three races. Roberts was the top individual points scorer in the event with 93 points, five more than Barry Sheene, the top British rider.|$|E

5|$|Rega {{went against}} <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> of the time, preferring {{to make their}} decks {{lightweight}} and rigid {{as a means of}} controlling unwanted resonances. Their belief was that mass absorbs energy and results in lost music. In other senses, the turntables are deliberately minimalistic and neither require nor justify any 'tweaking' by users, except adjustment to the vertical-tracking-angle (VTA) of the cartridge. It is a belt-driven design incorporating a driving 'sub-platter' mounted on a high quality oil-lubricated bearing, which is fixed directly to a medite (MDF) plinth supported by three simple rubber feet. A heavy glass platter sits atop the sub-platter, which is driven by a mechanically-isolated 24V synchronous motor through a rubber belt. A 2mm-thick mat sits on top of the glass platter. The turntable is without suspension, and the rubber feet provide limited mechanical isolation from floor-transmitted vibrations. A perspex cover is provided for some isolation against airborne vibrations. The record deck is single speed – it runs at 33 rpm, and the user must physically remove the platter to reposition the drive belt to play 45 rpm records.|$|E
5|$|After the 2014 Finals, LeBron James {{became a}} free agent and {{returned}} to the Cleveland Cavaliers where he teamed up with Kyrie Irving. The Cavs also traded for Kevin Love to form a new Big Three in Cleveland as they led the Cavs to the 2015 NBA Finals. In the 2015 postseason, 2014 finalist Miami Heat did not qualify in the playoffs after losing James to free agency and due to mediocrity stemming from brutal injuries all season, and the former defending champions, the San Antonio Spurs, were eliminated in a Game 7 battle against the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round. This allowed Cleveland to conquer the East. Golden State, spearheaded by reigning MVP, Stephen Curry, achieved a 67–15 record and were able to take the West. Entering the 2015 Finals, James and current Cavalier and former Heat teammate James Jones made their fifth straight finals appearance – the first two players to do this since the 1960s Celtics. The Warriors managed to defy <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> and traditionalist ideas by winning the championship with a small-ball, three-point shooting, fast-paced team. The Warriors won Game 1 in overtime, with the Cavaliers losing Irving to injury in the process. The Cavaliers would win Games 2 and 3, however, the Warriors won the next three games after coach Steve Kerr made the adjustment of inserting sixth man Andre Iguodala into the starting lineup in place of center Andrew Bogut, thus achieving the desired small-ball offense. The Warriors defeated the Cavaliers 4–2, with Iguodala becoming the first player to not start in any regular season game to win the Finals MVP award.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} year with the Lakers under new coach Joe Mullaney, Chamberlain seriously injured his knee. He was injured in the ninth game of the schedule, {{suffering}} a total rupture of the patellar tendon {{at the base of}} his right kneecap, and missed the next several months before appearing in the final three games of the 82-game regular season. Owing to a great start, he managed to average 27.3 points, 18.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game. Again, the Lakers charged through the playoffs, and in the 1970 NBA Finals, the Lakers were pitted against the New York Knicks, loaded with future Hall-of-Famers Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, and Walt Frazier. Cherry observed that Reed, a prolific midrange shooter, was a bad matchup for Chamberlain: having lost lateral quickness due to his injury, the Lakers center was often too slow to block Reed's preferred high post jump shots. In Game 1, New York masterminded a 124–112 win in which Reed scored 37 points. In Game 2, Chamberlain scored 19 points, grabbed 24 rebounds, and blocked Reed's shot in the final seconds, leading the Lakers to a 105–103 win. Game 3 saw Jerry West famously hit a 60-foot shot at the buzzer to tie the game at 102; however, the Knicks took the game 111–108. In Game 4, Chamberlain scored 18 points and grabbed 25 rebounds and helped tie the series at 2. In Game 5, with the Knicks trailing by double digits, Reed pulled his thigh muscle and seemed to be done for the series. By <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom,</b> Chamberlain now should have dominated against little-used Knicks backup centers Nate Bowman and Bill Hosket or forwards Bradley and DeBusschere, who gave up more than half a foot against the Lakers center. Instead, the Lakers gave away their 13-point halftime lead and succumbed to the aggressive Knicks defense: L.A. committed 19 second half turnovers, and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times, respectively, in the entire second half. The Lakers lost 107–100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history. In Game 6, Chamberlain scored 45 points, grabbed 27 rebounds and almost single-handedly equalized the series in a 135–113 Lakers win, and with Reed out, the Knicks seemed doomed prior to Game 7 in New York.|$|E
40|$|The transatlantic {{complaints}} over {{hormone-treated beef}} and {{genetically modified organisms}} before the World Trade Organisation (WTO) seem to confirm two separate but related <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdoms</b> about the transatlantic economic relationship: that it is highly conflictual and {{that many of the}} conflicts are rooted in profoundly different approaches to regulation. This article argues that neither of the two <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdoms</b> is accurate. Rather, it contends that they are products of two, compounding analytical shortcomings: one methodological, one empirical. The methodological shortcoming takes the form of an implicit selection bias. While WTO complaints are high profile they are rare and extreme examples; it is, therefore, unsound to generalise from them to the regulatory relationship as a whole. The empirical shortcoming has to do with neither the beef hormones nor the GMO dispute demonstrating what it is purported to. The article thus serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of relying on obvious cases and the need to question whether evidence really does support a prevailing popular narrative...|$|R
