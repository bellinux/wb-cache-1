5|$|At 10:00 on {{the morning}} of 31May, Laforey sent the boats from his {{squadron}} inshore to attack the grounded Confiante. <b>Coming</b> <b>alongside</b> the wreck at 12:45, the British boarding party, under Lieutenants George Acklom and William J. Simonds, found no one alive on the ship, but counted a large number of French dead still on board. Removing the French colours and paperwork, the boarding party started fires in the bow and stern of the corvette before withdrawing, despite a steady but ineffective musket fire from French troops overlooking the beach and a force of cavalry moving along the shore. The fire rapidly destroyed Confiante and the British boarding party retired without casualties.|$|E
5|$|The British ships {{separated}} {{and attempted to}} escape, but the French commander Contre-amiral Joseph-Marie Nielly simply split his forces in response, and although Canada was eventually able to outrun pursuit, Alexander was slower and was caught by several French ships in succession. The first two opponents were driven off, but the third succeeded in <b>coming</b> <b>alongside</b> and, in a fierce and close fought duel, compelled Captain Richard Rodney Bligh to surrender his ship {{in the face of}} overwhelming odds. The battle was a rare French victory, lying between the significant British victories at the Glorious First of June and the Battle of Groix, in the Royal Navy campaign against the French fleet at Brest.|$|E

40|$|Following {{the prime}} minister's {{surprise}} {{announcement of a}} federal election for September 14, attention will inevitably fall on the role Labor's key electoral reforms may play in the <b>coming</b> contest. <b>Alongside</b> a plethora of routine updates, the most significant change this government has made has been the long-overdue overhaul of Australia's electoral enrolment procedures. Also contentious, but far less significant in impact, will be proposed reforms to political donations...|$|R
25|$|As {{one of the}} {{processes}} of treatment, confrontation with their sources of trauma plays a crucial role. While debriefing people immediately after an event has not been shown to reduce incidence of post-traumatic stress, <b>coming</b> <b>alongside</b> people experiencing trauma in a supportive way has become standard practice.|$|E
25|$|Jacks are {{additional}} national flags flown by warships (and certain other vessels) {{at the head}} of the ship. These are usually flown while not underway and when the ship is dressed on special occasions. Jacks in the Royal Navy must be run up when the first line is ashore when <b>coming</b> <b>alongside.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{warships}} of {{the time}} were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship <b>coming</b> <b>alongside</b> an enemy vessel, lashing the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.|$|E

25|$|Off the Cape Verde Islands they {{encountered}} two frigates and two merchant ships, one a brigantine {{and the other}} a schooner, all at anchor. The French frigates did not respond to the Portuguese and Spanish flags that the British set and instead set sail as the British frigates approached; the British frigates then pursued them. Astraea had problems with her sails so Creole pulled ahead. She exchanged some shots and eventually four broadsides with the rearmost French frigate, which {{would turn out to be}} Sultane. Astraea then sailed between Creole and her opponent, <b>coming</b> <b>alongside</b> the French frigate. Two broadsides from Astraea then temporarily silenced the French frigate as fires aboard Creole took her out of the action for a while. She re-engaged Sultane, but then disengaged and sailed towards Santiago.|$|E
50|$|For Panathinaikos' owners, {{finishing}} the previous 1996-97 season without winning any trophies (after finally winning both the EuroLeague and the Greek Cup in the 1995-96 season, {{after years of}} trying), was deemed unacceptable, and brought about big changes to the team. The team's head coach, Božidar Maljković (Radja's mentor from his Split days), was already released during the previous failed season, while his interim replacement, Michalis Kokalis, was let go {{in the summer of}} 1997, to make way for new head coach Lefteris Subotić.

2500|$|With daylight, Bagley {{returned}} to the heavy cruiser and came alongside her starboard quarter. Since {{it appeared that the}} ship could be saved, a salvage crew of about 325 able-bodied men went back aboard Astoria. Another bucket brigade attacked the fires while the ship's first lieutenant investigated all accessible lower decks. A party of men collected the dead and prepared them for burial. [...] came up to assist in the salvage effort at about 0700. After securing a towline, Hopkins proceeded ahead, swinging Astoria around in an effort to tow her to the shallow water off Guadalcanal. A second gasoline-powered handy-billy, transferred from Hopkins, promptly joined the struggle against the fires. [...] soon arrived on the scene, <b>coming</b> <b>alongside</b> the cruiser at about 0900 to pump water into the fire forward.

2500|$|The Royal Navy {{commissioned}} Saracen in August 1812 under Commandeer John Harper. All he had {{available to}} him were his marines and [...] "a few worn-out sailors, retained for harbour duty." [...] On 21 August Sir Richard Bickerton, commander-in-chief at Portsmouth, ordered Harper to patrol off the coast. The next evening Saracen was some seven or eight miles off Beachy Head when Harper observed two large luggers chasing three well-laden British merchant vessels. After a short chase and some combat, Saracen succeeded in capturing the French privateer Coureur (or Courier), of Calais, by <b>coming</b> <b>alongside</b> and boarding her. Coureur was armed with 14 guns and had a crew of 50 men {{under the command of}} Captain Joreur. French casualties amounted to Joreur and two men wounded; Saracen had no casualties. Harper then returned with his prize to Portsmouth. He had too few men to man the prize, guard his prisoners, and still chase the second privateer. The prisoners reported that the second lugger was Honoria, of the same strength as Coureur. Coureur was a new vessel, and the two privateers were only eight hours out of Dieppe and had not captured anything when Saracen had appeared on the scene.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1798 Humphreys {{was sent}} {{with some of}} Junos men to support a cutting out {{expedition}} led by Captain Adam Mackenzie of [...] off the island of Schiermonnikoog. In an action on 11 August British boats succeeded in attacking and capturing the gunboat Crash, and preparing an operation to capture a large Dutch schooner, named Vengeance, anchored {{under the protection of}} a battery on the island, Mackenzie sent Humphreys and another lieutenant to capture some schuyts on 12 August. They captured two, burning one and sailing the other back to the British flotilla. Mackenzie armed the captured schuyt with 12-pdr carronades and named her Undaunted, placing Humphreys in command. Mackenzie launched his attack on the Dutch schooner and battery the following day, 13 August. Crash was supposed to have covered Humphreys in Undaunted, but she ran aground. Undaunted, Humphreys pushed on, <b>coming</b> <b>alongside</b> the Dutch schooner just as she was abandoned by her crew. The strong tide meant that he could not maintain his station alongside the Dutch vessel, and the roundness of her sides prevented him from leaping aboard. Instead he took a rope and jumped into the sea, hoping to be able to swim to the ship, board her and attach a rope. Once in the water he found that he could make little headway against the tide, and had to be hauled back on board. He had just regained the deck of Undaunted when Vengeance exploded, her crew having set a fuse to the ship's magazine before they abandoned her. Meanwhile the rest of the flotilla successfully stormed the Dutch battery and spiked its guns. None of the attacking force was killed or wounded in the operation.|$|E

The corsair, shouting his war cry of [...] "Allah!" [...] sprang with the bound of a wild cat upon Gervaise; his weapon descended on his uplifted guard, and shore right through the stout blade. With a shout of triumph, the corsair raised his arm to repeat the blow; but Gervaise in turn sprang forward, and struck with all his force with the pommel of his sword on the forehead of his opponent. The latter fell as if shot, his weapon dropping from his hand beside him.|$|R
40|$|A {{decline in}} {{governmental}} distortions to agricultural and other trade since the 1980 s {{has contributed to}} economic growth and poverty alleviation globally. But new modeling results suggest that has taken the world only three-fifths of the way towards freeing merchandise trade, and that farm policies are responsible for 70 percent of the global welfare cost of remaining distortions to goods markets as of 2004. Meanwhile, new drivers are affecting the mean and variance of world prices of farm products, including biofuel mandates and subsidies, climate change mitigation policies and adaptation, water institution and policy developments, difficulties in concluding a multilateral Doha Round agricultural agreement at the WTO, and policies relating to transgenic foods.

5000|$|According to the band's lead vocalist, guitarist and {{producer}} Chad I Ginsburg, [...] "Head for a Breakdown" [...] {{is a song}} [...] "about taking things too far when you darn right know it won't end well but you do it anyway". Loudwire's Joe DiVita provided {{an overview of the}} song upon its release, outlining that [...] "Unlike the two previous singles, [...] "Head for a Breakdown" [...] rests on the more somber side of the CKY sound, opening with some light acoustics, gradually working in a feature melody and thumping groove. Flush with hooks, the song boasts a powerful verse and highly-memorable, sing-song chorus that seesaws between singer/guitarist Chad I Ginsburg's soulful delivery and a melody-driven passage. Over the bridge, the track builds to a climax of sorts with the most aggressive moments <b>coming</b> in <b>alongside</b> the solo." [...] Consequence of Sound's Ben Kaye claimed that [...] "there's an undeniable melodic quality here that aligns the track more with stadium rock 'n roll than the band has ever been before".|$|R
