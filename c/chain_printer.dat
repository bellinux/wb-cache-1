50|$|A {{file storage}} of 96 MByte were also attached. The line printer used was a Potter Model HSP-3502 <b>chain</b> <b>printer</b> with 96 {{printing}} characters and {{a speed of}} about 230 lines per minute.|$|E
50|$|In addition, System/360 {{computers}} {{could use}} certain peripherals that were originally developed for earlier computers. These earlier peripherals used a different numbering system, {{such as the}} IBM 1403 <b>chain</b> <b>printer.</b> The 1403, an extremely reliable device that had already {{earned a reputation as}} a workhorse, was sold as the 1403-N1 when adapted for the System/360.|$|E
5000|$|Chain {{printers}} (also {{known as}} train printers) placed the type on moving bars (a horizontally-moving chain). As with the drum printer, as the correct character passed by each column, a hammer {{was fired from}} behind the paper. Compared to drum printers, chain printers had the advantage that the type chain could usually be changed by the operator. A further advantage was that vertical registration of characters in a line was much improved over drum printers, which needed extremely precise hammer timing to achieve a reasonably straight line of print. By selecting chains that had a smaller character set (for example, just numbers and a few punctuation marks), the printer could print much faster than if the chain contained the entire upper- and lower-case alphabet, numbers, and all special symbols. This was because, with many more instances of the numbers appearing in the chain, the time spent waiting for the correct character to [...] "pass by" [...] was greatly reduced. Common letters and symbols would appear more often on the chain, according to the frequency analysis of the likely input. It was also possible to play primitive tunes on these printers by timing the nonsense of the printout to the sequence on the chain, a rather primitive piano. IBM was probably the best-known <b>chain</b> <b>printer</b> manufacturer and the IBM 1403 {{is probably the most}} famous example of a <b>chain</b> <b>printer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|More {{well-known}} were various demo {{programs to}} play music on transistor radios placed on the CPU and computer [...] "art", mostly kitschy pictures printed using Xs and 0s on <b>chain</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bar {{printers}} {{were similar}} to <b>chain</b> <b>printers</b> but were slower and less expensive. Rather than a chain moving continuously in one direction, the characters were on fingers mounted on a bar that moved left-to-right and then right-to-left {{in front of the}} paper. An example was the IBM 1443.|$|R
50|$|Character matrix {{printers}} are {{a category}} of computer printers (typically impact printers) that place characters from a fixed character set anywhere onto a fixed grid of possible locations on the page. Examples of these are daisy wheel printers, golf ball <b>printers,</b> teleprinters, <b>chain</b> <b>printers,</b> and band printers. A character printer prints one character at a time.|$|R
5000|$|When faster {{computers}} were developed, however, {{the speed of}} card reading, magnetic tape, and early disk drives, along with newer high speed transistorized circuits, meant that processing could be done {{at a much higher}} speed, and a faster print mechanism was needed to match the resulting productivity. [...] IBM's early computers, such as the IBM 701, were developed for higher speed calculation than was possible with earlier electromechanical calculating machines. They did not have a demand for high speed printing, as the results of massive calculations produced very little printed output. Around the time that the 1403 was introduced, IBM's line of computers had been largely divided into two lines, [...] "scientific" [...] and [...] "business." [...] However, as newer {{computers were}} being used for a greater variety of purposes, there was a need to print a greater variety of characters from a single device, including upper and lower case alphabets. With type bars and type wheels, changing character sets was impractical. The advent of the <b>chain</b> <b>printer,</b> as used in the 1403, allowed the type chain assembly to be removed and replaced within a few minutes. With the cover open, the print unit was unlatched and swung open, the ribbon roll covering the front of the chain was removed, whereupon the print chain assembly could be unlatched and lifted out.|$|E
50|$|Development {{began in}} 1969 using a project code name of Jubilee. Later, the code name {{was changed to}} Argonaut. IBM did not however have a xerographic printer to base the Jubilee on (all {{printers}} {{up to this point}} were <b>chain</b> <b>printers).</b> This meant prototyping used an IBM Copier I which was not capable of anywhere near the product goal of 1 million pages per month. Therefore, dramatic developments were required in areas such as: paper path handling, lasers and optics, toner fusion and control electronics.|$|R
5000|$|Band {{printers}} are {{a variation}} of <b>chain</b> <b>printers,</b> where a thin steel band is used instead of a chain, with the characters embossed or etched onto the band. Again, a selection of different bands were generally available with a different mix of characters so a character set best matched to the characters commonly printed could be chosen. Dataproducts was a well known manufacturer of band printers, with their B300, B600, and B1000 range, the model number representing the lines per minute rate of the printer. (The B300 was effectively a B600 with only half the number of hammers—one per two character positions. The hammer bank moved back and forth one character position, requiring two goes to print all characters on each line.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{line printer}} is an impact printer that prints one entire line of text at a time. It is mostly {{associated}} with unit record {{equipment and the}} early days of digital computing, but the technology is still in use. Print speeds of 600 lines-per-minute (approximately 10 pages per minute) were achieved in the 1950s, later increasing to as much as 1200 lpm. Line printers print a complete line at a time and have speeds in the range of 150 to 2500 lines per minute. The different types of line printers are drum <b>printers</b> and <b>chain</b> <b>printers.</b> Other non-impact technologies have also been used, as thermal line printers were popular in the 1970s and 1980s, [...] and some inkjet and laser printers produce output a line or a page at a time.|$|R
50|$|Most drum, <b>chain,</b> and bar <b>printers</b> {{were capable}} of {{printing}} up to 132 columns, but a few designs could only print 80 columns and some other designs as many as 160 columns.|$|R
50|$|Island Ink-Jet {{is a large}} printer ink {{and laser}} toner supply chain store with stores in Canada and Puerto Rico. The brand is {{currently}} owned by The Equipment leasing company ltd. and based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, and locations operate under a franchising business model. The <b>chain</b> offer a <b>printer</b> ink cartridge refill service and sell several varieties of ink cartridges and toner cartridges including remanufactured cartridges.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chain</b> or train <b>printers,</b> {{where the}} {{character}} set is arranged multiple times around a linked chain or {{a set of}} character slugs in a track traveling horizontally past the print line. The IBM 1403 {{is perhaps the most}} popular, and comes in both chain and train varieties. The band printer is a later variant where the characters are embossed on a flexible steel band. The LP27 from Digital Equipment Corporation is a band printer.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s IBM {{provided}} {{a program called}} FORMAT for generating printed documents on any computer capable of running Fortran IV. [...] Written by Gerald M. Berns, FORMAT was described in his paper [...] "Description of FORMAT, a Text-Processing Program" [...] (Communications of the ACM, Volume 12, Number 3, March, 1969) as [...] "a production program which facilitates the editing and printing of 'finished' documents directly on the printer of a relatively small (64k) computer system. It features good performance, totally free-form input, very flexible formatting capabilities including up to eight columns per page, automatic capitalization, aids for index construction, and a minimum of nontext [...] items." [...] Input was normally on punched cards or magnetic tape, with up to 80capital letters and non-alphabetic characters per card. The limited typographical controls available were implemented by control sequences; for example, letters were automatically converted to lower case unless they followed a full stop, that is, the [...] "period" [...] character. Output could be printed on a typical line printer in all-capitals — or in upper and lower case using a special ("TN") <b>printer</b> <b>chain</b> — or could be punched as a paper tape which could be printed, in better than line printer quality, on a Flexowriter. A workalike program with some improvements, DORMAT, was developed and used at University College London.|$|R
