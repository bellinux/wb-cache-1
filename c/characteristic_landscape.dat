25|$|Ekiti {{country is}} {{generally}} an upland zone, with elevations being generally above 450m throughout. Around Akure, elevations drop to around 360m. It lies on an area underlain by metamorphic rock, and is generally an undulating {{country with a}} <b>characteristic</b> <b>landscape</b> that consists of old plains broken by steep-sided outcrops that may occur singularly or in groups or ridges. Such outcrops {{can be seen in}} places at Aramoko, Efon-Alaaye, Ikere-Ekiti, Igbara-odo and Okemesi-Ekiti among others. Rugged hills dot the landscape, notable among which are the Olosunta hills of Ikere-Ekiti in the south, Effon ridge which runs longitudinally around Efon Alaaye on the western boundary, and Ado Hills in the centre. The topography was perhaps the single strongest reason why the Ekitis never became a single unit politically. The area enjoys a tropical climate with two distinct seasons. These are the rainy season which lasts from (April–October) and the dry season which commences in late November and ends in March. Temperature ranges between 21° and 28°C with high humidity. In the South, the vegetation is primarily Tropical hardwood forest, while a mixed / derived type savannah can be observed in the northern peripheries.|$|E
60|$|Speaking {{generally}} as to {{the capacity}} and sure future destiny of that plain and prairie area (larger than any European kingdom) it is the inexhaustible land of wheat, maize, wool, flax, coal, iron, beef and pork, butter and cheese, apples and grapes--land of ten million virgin farms--to the eye at present wild and unproductive--yet experts say that upon it when irrigated may easily be grown enough wheat to feed the world. Then as to scenery (giving my own thought and feeling,) while I know the standard claim is that Yosemite, Niagara falls, the upper Yellowstone and the like, afford the greatest natural shows, I am not so sure but the Prairies and the Plains, while less stunning at first sight, last longer, fill the esthetic sense fuller, precede all the rest, and make North America's <b>characteristic</b> <b>landscape.</b>|$|E
