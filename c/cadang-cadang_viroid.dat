50|$|The CCCVd {{is widely}} spread in Philippines {{and it is}} mostly found in Bicol Region, Masbate, Catanduanes, Samar and other smaller islands in the zone. It is known that the present northernmost {{boundary}} is at the latitude of Manila and the southernmost at the latitude of Homonhon Island. This fact is important due to {{the proximity of the}} disease to the major coconut and oil palm growing area of Mindanao. An isolated focus of infection has been found on Solomon Islands, Oceania.The available data at the present suggests that the epidemiology of <b>cadang-cadang</b> <b>viroid</b> may not be spreading into any specific route.|$|E
40|$|Orange Spotting (OS) disease {{which is}} caused by <b>Cadang-Cadang</b> Coconut <b>Viroid</b> (CCCVd) is an {{emerging}} problem in oil palm. This study was aimed at quantifying the spatial variability of OS disease severity {{as an effort to}} augment the effectiveness of OS phytopathometry appraisal. A 4. 2 ha study plot was established in a commercial oil palm plantation at Sungai Buloh, Selangor. A total of 587 geo-referenced trees were visually observed for OS disease symptoms. OS disease severity data were first subjected to exploratory analysis and followed by variography and interpolation analyses to assess spatial variability. The incidence OS disease in the study area was 74. 3 %. Measured OS disease severity ranged from 0 - 92. 3 %. The spatial structure of OS disease severity was described by an exponential model with an effective range of 29. 1 m. OS disease severity exhibited a strong spatial dependence with a nugget to sill ratio of 0. 15. The spatial variability map of OS disease severity revealed spatial clustering of kriged values, where 73 % of the study area showed low severity (1 - 30 %), 25 % showed moderate severity (30 - 60 %) and approximately 2 % showed high severity (> 60 %). This study demonstrates the utility of geo-spatial information in understanding the OS disease severity scale which could assist in site-specific disease monitoring and intervention...|$|R
5000|$|Cadang-cadang is {{a disease}} caused by Coconut <b>cadang-cadang</b> <b>viroid</b> (CCCVd), a lethal viroid of Coconut (Cocos nucifera), Anahaw (Livistona rotundifolia) Buri (Corypha utan), and African Oil Palm (Elaeis guineensis). The name cadang-cadang comes from the word gadang-gadang that means dying in Bicol. It was {{originally}} reported on San Miguel Island in the Philippines in 1927/1928. [...] "By 1962, all but 100 of 250,000 palms on this island had died from the disease," [...] indicating an epidemic. Every year one million coconut palms are killed by CCCVd and over 30 million coconut palms have been killed since Cadang-cadang has been discovered. CCCVd directly affects the production of copra, a raw material for coconut oil and animal feed. Total losses of about 30 million palms and annual yield losses of about 22,000 tons of copra {{have been attributed to}} Cadang-cadang disease in the Philippines.|$|E
50|$|Tinangaja {{disease is}} caused by coconut trinangaja viroid (CTiVd), which has 64% {{sequence}} homology with CCCVd. This disease {{has been found in}} Guam. Coconuts from Asia and South Pacific have been found to have viroids with similar nucleic acid sequences of CCCVd. The pathogenicity of CTiVd is uncertain.Coconut <b>cadang-cadang</b> <b>viroid,</b> also known as CCCVd, is responsible for a lethal disease of coconut plant first reported in the early 1930 in the Philippines. CCCVd is the smallest known pathogen and it is biologically distinct from other viroids; it consists of circular or lineal single-stranded RNA with a basic size of 246 or 247, it is thought it can be transmitted by seed or pollen (with low transmission rates) and occur in almost all plant parts. Once infected, coconut palm shows yellow leaf spots and nut production ceases; from appearance of first symptoms to tree death, time ranges from around 8 to 16 years, but the pest is generally greater in older plants. It is estimated that over 30 million coconut palms have been killed by cadang-cadang since it was first recognised and the loss of production is valued at about $80 - $100 for each planting site occupied by an infected tree.|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comVariants of Coconut <b>cadang-cadang</b> <b>viroid</b> have been identified in a plantation oil palm growing in Malaysia. Three size classes are described, comprising 297, 293, and 270 nt. Compared with the 296 -nt form of coconut cadangcadang viroid (CCCVd), all variants substituted C 31 →U in the pathogenicity domain and A 175 →C in the right-hand terminus. Other mutations and deletions accounted for the different sizes. These are the first sequences reported for variants of Coconut <b>cadang-cadang</b> <b>viroid</b> in a species other than coconut palm, {{and this is the first}} evidence that variants closely related to CCCVd occur outside the Philippines...|$|E
40|$|A viroid-like RNA was {{detected}} in nucleic acid preparations {{from two of}} the three commercial hop varieties grown in Spain. It had a size very close to that of avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBV), although dot-blot analysis revealed that it was very different in base sequence from ASBV, coconut <b>cadang-cadang</b> <b>viroid,</b> hop stunt viroid (HSV) and citrus exocortis viroid. In its physical and biological properties, the viroid-like RNA differed from the previously characterized HSV. Viroids are the only class of subviral agents endowed with autonomous replication whose molecular structure is well known. They comprise a single-stranded circular RNA which is highly self-complementary (Diener, 1979) and has a size range from 246 to 375 nucleotide residues (S~inger, 1984; Keese & Symons, 1985; Riesner & Gross, 1985). Viroids cause several diseases of higher plants (Riesner & Gross, 1985), although they can also replicate in other plants without detectable damage to the host (Owens et al., 1978). The last observation led some years ago to the proposal that an increasing number of viroid-like RNAs would be isolated from apparently healthy plants (Diener, 1979). This assumption has been confirmed recently in the case of grapevine (Sano et al., 1985, 1986; Flores et al., 1985). The detection of viroid-like RNA...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of {{one member of}} a family of maize mitochondrial RNA replicons (or RNA plasmids), RNA b, has been characterized. It is shown that RNA b shares a 13 nucleotide sequence with the central conserved region of <b>Cadang-Cadang</b> <b>viroid</b> of coconuts which might be involved in substrate recognition by the RNA replicase during replication. RNA b likely was derived from a larger member in that family, RNA a, through co-linear deletions similar to those involved with the generation of the defective interfering (DI) elements associated with both animal and plant viruses. RNA b may represent a "selfish" RNA optimized for replication as it does not have the capacity to encode its own replicase. Mitochondrial RNA plasmids have been found not to be restricted to the S and RU cytoplasms, as previously reported. Related plasmid RNAs have been detected in maize plants with C, N and T cytoplasms as well as 13 Latin American races. They were not found, however, in teosintes, indicating that the ancestral nucleic acid from which these RNAs evolved was acquired soon after the split between teosintes and maize, before the divergence of the maize races. Distribution of the plasmid RNAs, a maize mRNA (atp 6), and a mitochondrial rRNA (26 S) in different organs and tissues was investigated by in situ hybridization. These results indicated that mitochondrial gene expression is subjected to an unexpected degree of both spatial and developmental regulation, and that individual mitochondrial genes are subjected to different controls. Similar results were obtained in in situ hybridization studies of Brassica floral buds. Both studies suggested that the levels of mitochondrial genes transcripts are not particularly high in the tapetal cells of both maize and Brassica anthers contrary to common belief. High levels of RNA plasmid were detected in the pollen of S maize anthers prior to pollen abortion, suggesting they might be related to the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) trait of S maiz...|$|E
