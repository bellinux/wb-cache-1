5|$|Even so, {{the general}} public was apathetic towards the new {{political}} situation and the British regarded this as the major impediment {{to the development of}} democratic government in Singapore. Thus, a <b>constitutional</b> <b>commission</b> headed by Sir George Rendel was set up in 1953 to recommend changes in the constitutional system, with the aim of increasing widespread participation in the central and local government of Singapore.|$|E

5|$|Halfway {{through the}} year South Katanga was further divided into the provinces of Katanga Oriental and Lualaba (also known as the new South Katanga). Though they were opposed to such divisions, many Katangese leaders from the secession joined the new provincial governments. A new <b>constitutional</b> <b>commission</b> was established, and in March 1964 it {{recommended}} that the Congo switch from its parliamentary system to a presidential model of government.|$|E

5|$|Marthinus Pretorius {{hoped to}} achieve either {{federation}} or amalgamation with the Orange Free State, {{but before he}} could contemplate this he would have to unite the Transvaal. In 1855 he appointed an eight-man <b>constitutional</b> <b>commission,</b> including Kruger, which presented a draft constitution in September that year. Lydenburg and Zoutpansberg rejected the proposals, calling for a less centralised government. Pretorius tried again during 1856, holding meetings with eight-man commissions in Rustenburg, Potchefstroom and Pretoria, but Stephanus Schoeman, Zoutpansberg's new Commandant-General, repudiated these efforts.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January 1966, {{shortly after}} Singapore's independence, the President of Singapore {{appointed}} a <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Commission</b> helmed by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin {{to consider how}} the rights of racial, linguistic, and religious minorities in the nascent nation should be protected. Singapore had just been ejected from Malaysia, and had experienced {{an extended period of}} racial and religious tension resulting from the Maria Hertogh riots. This experience reinforced the need for a multiracial society based on equality among races.|$|E
5|$|The Commission met from April 1968 – January 1, 1969, {{and former}} Governor Albertis S. Harrison, Jr. was {{appointed}} its chair.

5|$|In {{response}} to Thio's {{point on the}} views of the Wee Chong Jin <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Commission,</b> Shanmugam said that at the time the report was rendered the electorate was immature and unfamiliar with the importance of voting, a result of the country's history of colonial rule. In contrast, the high voter turnout rates in every election since then evidenced that Singaporeans have realized this point. With regard to the Taw Cheng Kong case, Shanmugam stated that since the Court's observations were obiter, they were unlikely to be treated as setting a precedent.|$|E
5|$|The Singaporean Parliament is unicameral in nature, {{consisting}} of a single legislative body tasked with making laws. However, {{the notion of a}} second legislative chamber was considered on two separate occasions. In 1954, a <b>constitutional</b> <b>commission</b> headed by Sir George William Rendel rejected a proposal for a second chamber composed solely of minority representatives, citing its unsuitability in a tiny state like Singapore and arguing that it might end up being unnecessarily bureaucratic. It also asserted that such an upper House might potentially be detrimental to social cohesion. This issue was also considered by the Wee Chong Jin Commission, which rejected it on similar grounds.|$|E

He served for three years in this post, defending UNESCO against allegations of corruption. At {{the end of his}} term as Australia's Ambassador Whitlam was elected to the Executive Board of UNESCO for a 3-year term, until 1989.

25|$|The Constitution enumerates the {{culpable}} {{violation of}} the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes, and betrayal of public trust as grounds for the impeachment of the President. The same also applies for the Vice President, the Members of the Supreme Court, the Members of the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Commissions,</b> and the Ombudsman.|$|R
5|$|The draft-Constitution {{was to be}} {{subjected}} to a referendum on 8 August 1797, after a very lively campaign in which the French ambassador Noël weighed in with a supportive appeal. This probably contributed to the resounding defeat of the proposal (108,761 votes to 27,995). The Assembly was back at square one. At this moment in time foreign events {{in the form of the}} 18 Fructidor coup of general Pierre Augereau intervened. This brought the more radical faction to power in France, which proved to be ultimately less patient with the vagaries of the Dutch political process, and more prone to intervene. Elections for a second National Assembly returned one in which the balance of power had shifted to the unitarists in the Fall of 1797. Nevertheless, the federalists managed to retain control of the new <b>constitutional</b> <b>commission</b> by a bare majority. This led to more dawdling and the unitarists in the Assembly now came with their own proposal in the form of the Declaration of 43 on 12 December 1797, containing a nine-point manifesto concerning the minimum conditions to which the new constitution should conform.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} vote in Singapore is not {{explicitly}} stated in Singapore's Constitution, but the Government has expressed the view {{that it may be}} inferred from the fact that Singapore is a representative democracy and from specific constitutional provisions, including Articles 65 and 66 which set out requirements for the prorogation and dissolution of Parliament and the holding of general elections. Speaking on the matter in Parliament in 2009, the Minister for Law, K. Shanmugam, said that the {{right to vote}} could not be a mere privilege as this would imply the existence of an institution superior to the body of citizens that is empowered to grant such a privilege, but that no such institution exists in a free country. In 1966 a <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Commission</b> chaired by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin advocated entrenching the right to vote within the Constitution, but this was not taken up by the Parliament of the day. When this proposal was repeated during the 2009 parliamentary debate, the Government took the view that such entrenchment was unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Like the old revolutionary States-General, the new National Assembly {{contained}} radically opposed parties: the unitary democrats, led by Pieter Vreede, Johan Valckenaer and Pieter Paulus, and the federalists, such as Jacob Abraham de Mist and Gerard Willem van Marle. But {{there was}} a broad continuum of opinion between these poles. In this force-field the federalists held the upper hand after the sudden demise of Paulus (who might otherwise have acted as a unifier). The conservative federalists were more adept at parliamentary manoeuvering (Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck proved himself especially adept at this). The frustration this engendered among the democrats led them to appeal to popular opinion and to extra-parliamentary action. Meanwhile, the Assembly installed a <b>constitutional</b> <b>commission</b> that in November 1796 presented a report that amounted to {{a continuation of the}} old federal arrangements. As this was totally unacceptable to the unitarists, this draft was subsequently amended into its opposite, by a compromise that finally formed a basis for a new Constitution. The Assembly now started upon a discussion of other important matters, like the separation between church and state, and the emancipation of minorities. The organs of the state were to be a bicameral Legislative Corps, to be elected in indirect elections, and a Directoire-like Executive of five members. The end result looked much like the French Constitution of 1795. This was approved by the Assembly on 10 May 1797.|$|E
