Organic poultry and dairy products come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones. Organic food is produced without the use of synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, bioengineering, and ionizing radiation. Before a product can be labeled [...] "organic", a Government-approved certifier inspects the farm where the food is grown to make sure the farmer is following all the rules necessary to meet USDA organic standards.

In 1990, Harike wetland was designated as a Ramsar site (Ramsar Convention 2008). At the State level it was declared a bird sanctuary (Harike Wetland Bird Sanctuary) by the State government of Punjab in 1992, though fishing was allowed.

Portions of our state, which when water can be supplied are very productive, yet because of its lack under present methods, are wothless for agricultural purposes. And even in the better portions, as well as, in other states, not seldom are crops materially injured by only a few weeks of drought at a critical time. If the crops could be tided over such periods, large losses might be avoided...|$|E
