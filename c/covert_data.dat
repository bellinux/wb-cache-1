40|$|Abstract—Cooperative {{spectrum}} sensing {{is key to}} the success of cognitive radio networks. Recently, fully distributed cooperative {{spectrum sensing}} has been proposed for its high performance benefits particularly in cognitive radio ad hoc networks. However, the cooperative and fully distributed natures of such protocol make it highly vulnerable to malicious attacks, and make the defense very difficult. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerabilities of distributed sensing architecture based on a representative distributed consensus-based spectrum sensing algorithm. We find that such distributed algorithm is particularly vulnerable to a novel form of attack called <b>covert</b> adaptive <b>data</b> injection attack. The vulnerabilities are even magnified under multiple colluding attackers. We further propose effective protection mechanisms, which include a robust distributed outlier detection scheme with adaptive local threshold to thwart the <b>covert</b> adaptive <b>data</b> injection attack, and a hash-based computation verification approach to cope with collusion attacks. Through simulation and analysis, we demonstrate the destructive power of the attacks, and validate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed protection mechanisms. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel method for digital audio {{steganography}} where encrypted <b>covert</b> <b>data</b> is embedded by adaptively modifying wavelet packet coefficients of host audio signal. The major contribution of the proposed scheme is the technique introduced for adaptively modifying the host audio to embed the <b>covert</b> <b>data.</b> The modification of host audio is done by imposing a constraint which forces the modified value {{to be in the}} same range as its neighborhood. Due to this constraint the noise introduced due to embedding is very low compared to existing methods. The main advantage with proposed embedding scheme is superior Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) values, with good hiding capacity and speed.
