2500|$|Carbon dioxide laser: When a laser is used {{to perform}} {{tonsillectomy}}, this is called laser-assisted serial tonsillectomy (LAST). This is different from procedures where a laser {{is used to}} reduce or resurface the tonsils (e.g. laser cryptolysis). Providing the absence of certain <b>contra-indications</b> such as sensitive gag reflex, LAST can be performed under local anesthetic as an outpatient procedure. A carbon dioxide laser is commonly used, and is swept over each tonsil 8–10 times. The smoke is aspirated out of the mouth to prevent smoke inhalation. Often, more than one procedure is required, each lasting about 20 minutes. The pain following LAST may be greater than other tonsillectomy methods. Due to the frequent requirement for multiple sessions, this treatment may work out more expensive than a single session tonsillectomy. A degree of patient compliance is required, making it unsuitable for young children and anxious persons, who risk harm if they move during the procedure.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundEuropean Guidelines for the {{treatment}} of CHF 2008 underline that there is no absolute level of creatinine which precludes the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs). AimsThe IMPACT-RECO program III analysed the impact of NYHA class and of comorbidities on therapeutic management of French outpatients with stable CHF and low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). MethodsThis survey was carried on 2007 among randomly selected French private cardiologists. 1574 patients with CHF and LVEF 220 μmol/L or 25 mg/dL was found in 173 patients. In the 467 patients not receiving ACEIs, reasons for non prescription were firstly <b>contra-indication</b> in 69 patients (14. 8 %) mostly because of renal dysfunction in 54 patients (78. 3 %), secondly side effects in 365 patients (78. 2 %) with renal insufficiency found in 25 patients (6. 85 %). In 1033 patients, ARBs was also not prescribed because of <b>contra-indication</b> for renal dysfunction in 79 patients (90. 8 %), or intolerance with renal insufficiency in 40 patients (32. 8 %). Thus, despite a mean creatinine clearance of 33. 3 ± 15. 1 mL/kg/min in 173 patients with renal dysfunction, ACEIs/ARB were not prescribed in 133 patients considering renal dysfunction as a <b>contra-indication.</b> ConclusionRenal dysfunction remains the main reason for not prescribing ACEIs/ARBs in CHF despite the possibility to easily adapt their dose to creatinine clearance. Improvement is still necessary so that ACEIs/ARBs should not be denied to CHF patients with concomitant renal dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|In this {{clinical}} trial, we {{aimed to}} compare three means of performing chronic hemodialysis {{in patients with}} <b>contra-indication</b> to systemic heparinization. This open-label monocentric randomized « n-of-one » trial, conducted in a single tertiary care center, recruited chronic hemodialysis patients with a <b>contra-indication</b> to systemic heparinization for at least 3 consecutive sessions. All patients underwent hemodialysis with an AN 69 ST dialyzer, and were administered three alternative dialysis procedures in a random sequence: intermittent saline flushes, constant saline infusion, or pre-dialysis heparin coating of the membrane. The primary outcome was the need to interrupt the dialysis session because of clotting events due to either (i) a complete coagulation of the circuit; (ii) a partial coagulation of the circuit; (iii) a> 50 % rise over baseline in the venous pressure. At {{the end of the}} inclusion period (May, 2007 to December, 2008), the number of patients to include (n= 75) was not reached: only 46 patients were included and underwent randomization. The study was terminated, and statistical analysis took into account 224 hemodialysis sessions performed in 44 patients with analyzable data. Heparin adsorption was associated with a significant reduction of the need to interrupt the dialysis session because of clotting events: odds ratio 0. 3 (CI 95 % 0. 2 to 0. 6; p 3 h dialysis sessions and for having complete blood restitution. There were no significant effects of the dialysis procedure on weight loss, online ionic dialysance, and adverse events.
