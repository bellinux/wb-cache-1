40|$|Introduction. Aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed by residents. Materials and Methods. We retrospectively reviewed 569 elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Results. Duration of surgery was 84 ± 39 min for residents versus[*][*] 66 ± 47 [*]min for <b>staff</b> <b>surgeons,</b> P< 0. 001. Rate of conversion was 3. 2 % for residents versus 2. 7 % for <b>staff</b> <b>surgeons,</b> P= 0. 7. There was no difference in the rates of intraoperative and postoperative complications for residents (1. 2 % and 3. 2 %) versus <b>staff</b> <b>surgeons</b> (1. 5 % and 3. 1 %), P= 0. 7 and P= 0. 9. Postoperative hospital stay was 3. 3 ± 1. 8 days for residents versus[*][*] 3. 4 ± 3. 2 days for <b>staff</b> <b>surgeons,</b> P= 0. 6. One death in patients operated by residents (1 / 246) and one in patients operated by <b>staff</b> <b>surgeons</b> (1 / 323) were found, P= 0. 8. No difference in the time to return to normal daily activities between residents (11. 3 ± 4. 2 days) and <b>staff</b> <b>surgeons</b> (10. 8 ± 5. 6 days) was found, P= 0. 2. Shorter duration of surgery when operating the senior residents (75 ± 31 minutes) than the junior residents (87 ± 27 minutes), P= 0. 003. Conclusion. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed by residents is a safe procedure with results comparable to those of <b>staff</b> <b>surgeons...</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: To {{confirm the}} safety and {{feasibility}} of single-incision laparoscopically assisted appendectomy (SILA) performed by resident doctors. Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 86 consecutive patients who underwent SILA between August 2010 and August 2016  at Kinki Central Hospital. During this period, 9 residents and 6 board-certified attending surgeons performed SILA. Data on the patients' characteristics and perioperative complications were collected from their medical records. Results: Resident doctors operated on 55 % (47 / 86) of patients undergoing SILA. There {{were no significant differences}} between the groups with regard to patient characteristics. Mean operative time in the resident and <b>staff</b> <b>surgeon</b> groups was 74  min and 71  min, respectively (p =  0. 5). Median blood loss in both the resident and <b>staff</b> <b>surgeon</b> groups was 0  mL (p =  0. 3). The rate of conversion to a different operative procedure was 4 % (2 / 47) in the resident group and 3 % (1 / 39) in the <b>staff</b> <b>surgeon</b> group (p =  1). All three above-mentioned procedures, two (4 %, 2 / 47) in the resident group and one (3 %, 1 / 39) in the <b>staff</b> <b>surgeon</b> group, were converted to multi-port laparoscopic appendectomy. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 5 days for both the resident and <b>staff</b> <b>surgeon</b> groups (p =  0. 7). Perioperative complications developed in 9 % (4 / 47) of the patients in the resident group and 21 % (8 / 39) of the patients in the <b>staff</b> <b>surgeon</b> group (p =  0. 1). Conclusions: SILA performed by residents under the guidance of a <b>staff</b> <b>surgeon</b> is safe and feasible...|$|R
