40|$|Non-cirrhotic portal {{hypertension}} is a poorly understood condition characterized by {{portal hypertension}} {{in the absence}} of conventional hepatic cirrhosis and described in association with blood coagulation disorders, myeloproliferative and immunological diseases and with exposure to toxic drugs. Very recently, precise classification criteria have been proposed in order to define four distinct subcategories. The present case highlights how the clinical presentation, the confounding results from imaging studies, and the difficulties in the histological evaluation often render cases of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension a real diagnostic challenge. It also underscores the classification problems which can <b>be</b> <b>faced</b> <b>once</b> this diagnosis <b>is</b> performed. Indeed, the different subcategories proposed result from the prevalent subtypes in a spectrum of hepatic regenerative responses to a variety of injuries determining microcirculatory disturbances. More flexibility in classification should derive from this etiopathogenic background...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a system to}} synthesize facial expressions by editing captured performances. For this purpose, we use the actuation of expression muscles to control facial expressions. We note {{that there have been}} numerous algorithms already developed for editing gross body motion. While the joint angle has direct effect on the configuration of the gross body, the muscle actuation has to go through a complicated mechanism to produce facial expressions. Therefore, we devote a significant part of this paper to establish the relationship between muscle actuation and facial surface deformation. We model the skin surface using finite element method to simulate the deformation caused by expression muscles. Then, we implement the inverse relationship, muscle actuation parameter estimation, to find the muscle actuation values from the trajectories of the markers on the performer <b>'s</b> <b>face.</b> <b>Once</b> the forward and inverse relationships are established, retargeting or editing a performance becomes an easy job. We apply the original performance data to different facial models with equivalent muscle structures, to produce similar expressions. We also produce novel expressions by deforming the original data curves of muscle actuation to satisfy the key-frame constraints imposed by animators...|$|R

3000|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{sheltering}} of the Megalithic Temples of Malta {{as a process}} which can also help others in similar situations to decide on whether to shelter or not. Giving a synopsis of the problems faced by these sites over the decades, and their monitoring and documentation immediately preceding the decision to shelter the sites and in the longer term, it also outlines the multi-disciplinary team-work which was essential for the successful execution of the project. An early conclusion that the main causes of deterioration were the aggressive environmental conditions surrounding the sites, primarily related to temperature, water and salts, and also anthropogenic pollution, led to extensive environmental monitoring, recording and documentation before and since the sheltering. An interpretation {{of the results of}} the monitoring in the light of the condition of the sites, before and after sheltering, is aimed at determining the effectiveness of the shelter, and also feed into the decision-making process on what to do next, which would inevitably have to <b>be</b> <b>faced</b> <b>once</b> the effective lifetime of the shelter ends. The Lessons Learnt from this project and assessment will lead to Guidelines being proposed to help other professionals who may be involved in the decision-making process whether to shelter other sites. 5 [...]...|$|R

This paper presents data on the causes of childrenâ€™s migration to the streets of a cap-ital city in a post-conflict West African country and the mul-tiple protection risks children <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> with <b>once</b> there. However, while this environment poses significant risks for children, potential sources of protection and psychosocial support can also be found to help mitigate negative develop-mental outcomes for children. Programmatic responses are discussed that involve the promotion of childrenâ€™s resilience through transforming the sources of risks into protective mechanisms and social support networks. The responses also include a search for durable solutions for children through family reunification and community reintegration...|$|R
