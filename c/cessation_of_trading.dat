40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the price bid for a takeover target, the probability of the bid succeeding and the target 2 ̆ 7 s price {{over the course of the}} bid. We test and reject Samuelson and Rosenthal 2 ̆ 7 s (1986) expected value hypothesis. We find that over the bid, the price of the target of a successful bid typically rises towards the bid price, but is not observed to converge with the bid price. This lack of observed convergenece appears to be due to an early <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> in many of the bids that succeed. In the case of bids that fail, the target 2 ̆ 7 s share price is typically observed to rise above the bid price early in the bid. We consider several explanations for this, and suggest that the expectation of a subsequent bid is the most plausible explanation. This is supported by our empirical evidence. We also find that in the cases where the bids fail, early <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> did not occur in the majority of cases...|$|E
40|$|Between {{the death}} of Nadir Shah, in 1747, and the {{establishment}} of the Qajar dynasty in 1795 there were 48 years of Zand rule in Persia, during which time Gulf trade declined and European factories closed down in several ports. Historians have offered varied and insubstantial reasons for this decline. In this thesis an attempt has been made, through the detailed use of primary sources, to offer a more logical and more reasoned interpretation of these developments in place of the older, ill-founded arguments. In our view, the prime cause of the decline in trade and the withdrawal of the trading settlement from Bandar Abbas was the 'commotions', or power struggles in the region. On one hand was the struggle for overall control of Persia whose consequence was the ruin of trade. On the other, the commotion in the area of Bandar Abbas, brought about by MuUa Ali Shah, the Banu Ma in Shaikh, Shaikh Rashid and the Charak Arabs, which was the main cause of the withdrawal from that port. The <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> at Bandar Riq and Khark island was caused by disturbances fomented by Mir Muhanna. According to the English, the main cause of the withdrawal of their settlement from Bandar Rlq was the conflict between Mir Muhanna and Karim Khan about Bandar Riq. But it was Mir Muhanna's suspicion that the English were his enemies and that they were the allies of Karim Khan which caused their expulsion. The Dutch, for their part, were expelled from Khark island after they had joined forces with Bushire in attacking Mir Muhanna on the orders of Karim Khan. In Bushire the case was different. Although the English acted neutrally in the conflicts they could not evade the dangers. They had suffered losses at Mir Muhanna's hands but Karim Khan believed that the English were refusing to help him against the Mir. The anger of Karim Khan, his determination not to receive the English in audience, and the fear that his brother, Zald Khan, would detain the English Agent in Bushire all motivated the withdrawal of the English settlement from there. At last, when the Qajar dynasty took control of all the Persian provinces {{at the beginning of the}} 19 th century, the value of English trade with Persia increased enormously...|$|E

40|$|After South Africa's {{democratic}} elections in 1994, large capital inflows were {{induced by the}} <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> and financial sanctions, improved creditworthiness and a liberalised capital account for foreigners. The flows were managed in a classic trade-off between currency stability, and raised interest rates to counter inflation resulting from a credit boom and partially sterilised intervention. In early 1996, the currency suffered a speculative attack. Using a theoretical model of currency crises, we present some empirical results suggesting the importance of economic fundamentals and policy credibility as determinants of investors' devaluation expectations prior to the crisis. Poor growth associated with subsequent protracted currency volatility and high interest rates argues {{for a range of}} complementary policies to manage inflows in South Africa. These include reserve requirements on certain inflows, prudent further liberalisation of domestic exchange controls, improved private and government savings policies, a medium-term public debt framework and closer monitoring of risk management by banking and other financial institutions. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the economic {{consequences of a}} twelve-month closure of U. S. borders in the form <b>of</b> <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> tourism and immigration flows.

Using a computable general equilibrium model, we find that border closure would cause substantial economic loss. However this damage is significantly reduced when critical imports (such as energy) are either exempted from the policy, or made available through use of domestic stockpiles (such as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve). Economic damage is reduced further if workers accept lower real wages for the duration of the security crisis. We argue that if border closure were ever to be contemplated as a response to a security or public health threat, it would be prudent to keep its scope to a minimum, to make its duration as short as possible, to allow market responses to run their course, and to enact countervailing policies that can help minimize the economic losses. border closure, strategic reserves, bottleneck imports, dynamic CGE...|$|R

50|$|The {{state of}} affairs in the early 16th century, Columbus's {{discovery}} of the New World and Dias's circumnavigation of Africa and the territorial fragmentation in the Empire led {{to a decline in}} trade and, thus, the city's affluence. The ossification of the social hierarchy and legal structures contributed to the decline in trade; under Leopold I (reigned 1658-1705) the patriciate was converted to a hereditary corporation, leading the merchant class to appeal to the Imperial counsellor, albeit unsuccessfully. During the Thirty Years' War it did not always succeed in preserving its policy of neutrality. Frequent quartering of Imperial, Swedish and League soldiers, war-contributions, demands for arms, semi-compulsory presents to commanders of the warring armies and the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> caused irreparable damage to the city.
