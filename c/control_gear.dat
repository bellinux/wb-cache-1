5000|$|... ==How It Works == The {{steering}} wheel {{is connected to}} the hydraulic control unit, which contains a slide valve, the <b>control</b> <b>gears</b> and linkage, and the centring piston and cam. The steering rack pinion {{is connected to the}} hydraulic control unit through an adjuster, to allow setting of the centre point of the steering. This then drives one of the <b>control</b> <b>gears,</b> the other being driven by the {{steering wheel}}. The control linkage consists of two gears coupled with rods through ball-joints. When the gears are turned relative to each other, the rods move the slide valve, allowing fluid in or out of the rack. This moves the rack, which in turn moves its pinion, turning the <b>control</b> <b>gears</b> back to their centre position. Compare this with a conventional power steering system, which relies on the flexing of a strong spring to control the valve.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. When {{designing}} a landing gear damper, it is well-known that damper characteristics required for good handling {{are not the}} same as those required for good ride comfort. Semi-active <b>control</b> landing <b>gear</b> damper, as their name implies, fill the gap between purely passive damper and fully active control Langing gear-control systems and offer the reliability of passive systems, yet maintain the versatility and adaptability of fully active devices. During recent years there has been considerable interest towards theoretical study and practical practical implementation of this semi-active <b>control</b> landing <b>gear</b> damper for their low energy requirement and cost. For this reason, The basic theoretical for semi-active landing gear damper design and implementation has been briefly reviewed, mathematical model of semi-active <b>control</b> landing <b>gear</b> is established. A state feedback semi-active controller is designed. At last, the passive <b>control</b> landing <b>gear</b> model and semi-active <b>control</b> landing <b>gear</b> model are simulated. Simulation result shows that the vibration of passive <b>control</b> landing <b>gear</b> is vehement, and the system stable time is long. But in the simi-active <b>control</b> landing <b>gear</b> system the impact load and vibraton can be reduced, the aircraft can reach the stability state in a few seconds.

The method is graphical and has several advantages over the standard numerical procedure based on Routh's discriminant.

25|$|On 17 October 1997, the mid-morning {{service to}} Wellington broke down 2.5km into the Rimutaka Tunnel from the Featherston portal after an {{electrical}} fault in locomotive DC 4951's <b>control</b> <b>gear.</b> The Rimutaka Tunnel is a radio dead-spot, {{and the train}} driver and guard found the Train Control telephones on the tunnel wall to be dead.

2500|$|The {{line between}} Shepherd's Bush and Bank was {{formally}} opened on 30 June 1900, public services beginning on 30 July. With a uniform fare of 2d the railway {{became known as}} the [...] "Twopenny Tube". It was initially operated by electric locomotives hauling carriages, but the locomotive's considerable unsprung weight caused much vibration in the buildings above the line, and the railway rebuilt the locomotives to incorporate geared drives. This allowed higher-speed and lighter motors to be used, which reduced the overall weight of the locomotive as well as the unsprung weight. The railway also tried an alternative approach: it converted four coaches to accommodate motors and <b>control</b> <b>gear.</b> Two of these experimental motor coaches were used in a 6-coach train, the <b>control</b> <b>gear</b> being operated by the system used on the Waterloo and City Railway.

2500|$|The [...] "emission mix" [...] on {{the lamp}} filaments/cathodes is {{required}} to enable electrons to pass into the gas via thermionic emission at the lamp operating voltages used. The mix is slowly sputtered off by bombardment with electrons and mercury ions during operation, but a larger amount is sputtered off each time the lamp is started with cold cathodes. The method of starting the lamp has {{a significant impact on}} this. Lamps operated for typically less than 3 hours each switch-on will normally run out of the emission mix before other parts of the lamp fail. The sputtered emission mix forms the dark marks at the lamp ends seen in old lamps. When all the emission mix is gone, the cathode cannot pass sufficient electrons into the gas fill to maintain the gas discharge at the designed lamp operating voltage. Ideally, the <b>control</b> <b>gear</b> should shut down the lamp when this happens. However, some <b>control</b> <b>gear</b> will provide sufficient increased voltage to continue operating the lamp in cold cathode mode, which will cause overheating of the lamp end and rapid disintegration of the electrodes (filament goes open-circuit) and filament support wires until they are completely gone or the glass cracks, destroying the low pressure gas fill and stopping the gas discharge.|$|E
