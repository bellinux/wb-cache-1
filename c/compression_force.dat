Determination of optimal <b>{{compression}}</b> <b>forces</b> {{and speed}} of compression {{for the production of}} aciclovir tablets. This thesis deals with the characterisation of impact compression process on hardness of the tablets. The theoretical part of the thesis describes the effective substance - aciclovir. It also describes compression equations which explain process of compression and factors influencing terminal weight and hardness of tablets. The aim of the experimental part of the work is to measure physical properties of the tablets and find <b>compression</b> <b>forces</b> {{and speed of}} compression which are suitable for compression tablets.

Team lifting could potentially lead to a higher variation in peak lumbar <b>compression</b> <b>forces</b> than lifts performed by one worker, resulting in higher maximal peak lumbar <b>compression</b> <b>forces.</b> This study compared single-worker lifts (25 -kg, iron bar) to two-worker lifts (50 -kg, two iron bars) and to four-worker lifts (100 -kg, iron lattice).

40|$|STUDY DESIGN. An in vivo {{study on}} weightlifters. OBJECTIVES. To {{determine}} if {{and how a}} stiff back belt affects spinal <b>compression</b> <b>forces</b> in weightlifting. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. In weightlifting, a back belt {{has been reported to}} enhance intraabdominal pressure (IAP) and to reduce back muscle EMG and spinal <b>compression</b> <b>forces.</b> METHODS. Nine experienced weightlifters lifted barbells up to 75 % body weight while inhaling and wearing a belt, inhaling and not wearing a belt, and exhaling and wearing a belt. IAP, trunk muscle EMG, ground reaction forces, and kinematics were measured. An EMG-assisted trunk model, including IAP effects, was used to calculate spinal <b>compression</b> and shear <b>forces</b> and to reveal the contribution of back muscles, abdominal muscles, and IAP to moment generation. RESULTS. The belt reduced <b>compression</b> <b>forces</b> by about 10 %, but only when inhaling before lifting. The moment generated by IAP increased when wearing a belt and inhaling, but this moment was small and the increase was largely negated by the flexing moment generated by abdominal muscles. CONCLUSIONS. Wearing a tight and stiff back belt while inhaling before lifting reduces spine loading. This is caused by a moment generated by the belt rather than by the IAP. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc...|$|R
