500|$|Weather {{conditions}} {{at the start of}} the race were cloudy with an air temperature between [...] and a track temperature ranging from [...] An estimated 30,000 people attended the event. CART set the mandatory pit stop window to a maximum of 47 laps which required all drivers to make at least four pit stops. Grace commanded the drivers to start their engines. The race started at 1:36p.m. local time. Bräck maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first turn. Tagliani drove alongside his teammate Carpentier and overtook him for ninth place. Serviá moved from 14th to tenth by the end of the first lap, but dropped to eleventh when he was passed by another car. He moved back into tenth place shortly afterwards. Junqueira was passed by Tagliani to move into seventh position on lap three. After starting from 12th, Fittipaldi dropped to the rear of the field and drove slower than the leading drivers. Tracy slowed without warning on lap 13 in the second turn with a power steering issue, and the first caution of the race was displayed two laps later when he stopped under the white line on the back straight with a gearbox problem requiring course officials to remove his car from the track. His engine's telemetry stopped working indicating a <b>crank</b> <b>sensor</b> failure, possibly caused by his gearbox problem.|$|E

50|$|A bad <b>crank</b> {{position}} <b>sensor</b> can worsen the way {{the engine}} idles, or the acceleration behaviour. If the engine is revved up with a bad or faulty sensor, it may cause misfiring, motor vibration or backfires. Acceleration might be hesitant, and abnormal shaking during engine idle might occur. In the worst case the car may not start.|$|R
50|$|Some engines, such as GM's Premium V family, use <b>crank</b> {{position}} <b>sensors</b> which read a reluctor ring {{integral to}} the harmonic balancer.

50|$|A <b>crank</b> <b>sensor</b> is an {{electronic}} device {{used in an}} internal combustion engine, both petrol and diesel, to monitor the position or rotational speed of the crankshaft. This information is used by engine management systems to control the fuel injection or the ignition system timing and other engine parameters.

5000|$|The 24-valve DOHC 4.0 L (3980 cc) version {{replaced}} the 3.6 L AJ6 in 1989. It featured a longer 102 mm stroke, and generated [...] power and 392 Nm of torque. The 4.0L engines {{as used in}} the 1990-1994 XJ40 cars continued with the <b>crank</b> <b>sensor</b> and empty distributor type of ignition system and the hot-wire Mass Air Flow sensor type of fuel injection control system as the 1988-1989 3.6L XJ40 cars.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>crank</b> <b>sensor</b> {{can be used}} in {{combination}} with a similar camshaft position sensor to monitor the relationship between the pistons and valves in the engine, which is particularly important in engines with variable valve timing.

The latter two sensors themselves are usually the General Motors type, although the controller can recalibrated to use other sensors including Ford and Bosch.|$|R
50|$|Profile {{ignition}} pickup (PIP) is {{the term}} used for the signal sent from the Ford EDIS to the electronic control module (ECM). This signal is the digitally modified signal that originated from the <b>Crank</b> Angle <b>Sensor</b> (CAS) in an alternating current format.

Beside the fuel-injection, a significant change for the Z24i was the addition of an optical <b>crank</b> angle <b>sensor</b> in the distributor rather than a vacuum advance and ignition module. This allowed the JECS throttle-body injection system to identify cylinder #1 top dead center (TDC).|$|R
50|$|The early {{lead was}} keenly contested between the No. 1 Audi of André Lotterer and the No. 8 Toyota of Anthony Davidson. By {{the end of}} the third hour, however the Audis had {{established}} a clear lead, occupying the first three places. Chasing their third consecutive Le Mans win, the No. 1 Audi led Tom Kristensen's No. 2 Audi by almost a minute until a <b>crank</b> <b>sensor</b> problem in the 7th hour forced them to take a lengthy pit stop. Rejoining the race several laps down in 24th place, they eventually battled their way back to 5th. Running in 2nd place, the No. 3 Audi driven by Oliver Jarvis also ran into problems, losing several minutes after a puncture. In the 22nd hour they overtook the No. 7 Toyota of Nicolas Lapierre to claim third spot. Soon afterwards, Lapierre skidded in the treacherous conditions and hit a wall. Initially he appeared to abandon the car, however he managed to restart it and return it to the pits for some quick repairs. He returned to the track in time to claim 4th place. In the final hour of racing, Sébastien Buemi in the No. 8 Toyota briefly managed to unlap himself, but soon afterwards decided to settle for 2nd place.|$|E

2500|$|The Camry {{was given}} a {{facelift}} in 1994 for the 1995 model year. Minor exterior changes included a revised front fascia with different front turn signals and reshaped headlamps. Additionally, the rear fascia was updated, now with body-coloured plastic between the tail lamps where the model name [...] "Camry" [...] was printed. This was instead of the red plastic on higher trim levels and black plastic on lower trim levels of the 1992 to 1994 models. The tail lamps themselves were also slightly different. Another change, this time mechanical came in 1996; the 2.2-liter engine was detuned slightly to [...] to meet stricter emissions standards. Additionally, in 1996 the cam angle sensor in the distributor was also replaced with a <b>crank</b> angle <b>sensor</b> to achieve a smoother idle.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The primary {{objective}} of the project {{is to create a}} prototype of a purely air powered motorcycle by retrofitting its internal combustion engine to run on compressed air. Firstly the conventional spark plug was replaced with a solenoid valve. The solenoid valve was initially actuated using a reed switch and magnet duo but then later replaced with an optical <b>crank</b> position <b>sensor</b> circuit due to reasons that include lack of control over the amount of air injected during each stroke and also for more precise control over the opening and closing of the valve. The torque brake power indicated power air consumption rate of the engine under load are calculated. Separate mounts for the modified engine and the cylindrical storage unit are designed and analysed using Catia v 4. Also possible ways of future scope of the prototype are mentioned...|$|R
5000|$|The Trionic T5.2 uses a Mecel {{patented}} ion-current measurement1 {{to decide}} which cylinder was in the compression phase and had just ignited the air/fuel mixture. The ion-current measurement is thus used to synchronise the ignition's firing of the spark plug with the cylinder which is full of compressed air/fuel. This ion-current measurement can also determine whether there had been detonation or knocking when the cylinder fired. Finally, the ion-current measurement {{can be used to}} identify a misfire with outstanding accuracy. [...] Trionic T5.2 uses a MAP (Manifold Absolute Pressure) sensor to, indirectly, measure the weight of the air that has been drawn/forced into the cylinders. It uses a simple slotted aperture disc in conjunction with a <b>crank</b> position <b>sensor</b> to identify the Top Dead Center (TDC) for cylinders 1 & 4 and also to measure the engine's RPM.|$|R
40|$|The {{robustness}} {{of a new}} single-cylinder {{pressure sensor}} concept is experimentally demonstrated on a six-cylinder heavy-duty diesel engine. Using a single-cylinder pressure <b>sensor</b> and a <b>crank</b> angle <b>sensor,</b> this single-cylinder pressure sensor concept estimates the in-cylinder pressure traces in the remaining cylinders by applying a real-time, flexible crankshaft model combined with an adaptation algorithm. The single-cylinder pressure sensor concept is implemented on CPU/field-programmable gate array–based hardware. For steady-state engine operating conditions, the added value of the adaptation algorithm is demonstrated for cases in which a fuel quantity change or start of injection change is applied in a single, non-instrumented cylinder. It is shown that for steady-state and transient engine conditions, the cylinder pressure traces and corresponding combustion parameters, indicated mean effective pressure, peak cylinder pressure, and crank angle at 50 % heat release, can be estimated with 1. 2 bar, 6. 0 bar, and 1. 1 CAD inaccuracy, respectively...|$|R
2500|$|Other {{innovations}} {{are currently}} available on various cars. In some models, {{rather than one}} central coil, there are individual coils on each spark plug, sometimes known as direct ignition or coil on plug (COP). This allows the coil a longer time to accumulate a charge between sparks, and therefore a higher energy spark. A variation on this has each coil handle two plugs, on cylinders which are 360 degrees out of phase (and therefore reach TDC at the same time); in the four-cycle engine this means that one plug will be sparking during {{the end of the}} exhaust stroke while the other fires at the usual time, a so-called [...] "wasted spark" [...] arrangement which has no drawbacks apart from faster spark plug erosion; the paired cylinders are 1/4 and 2/3. Other systems do away with the distributor as a timing apparatus and use a magnetic <b>crank</b> angle <b>sensor</b> mounted on the crankshaft to trigger the ignition at the proper time.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, the L61 {{received}} {{a multitude of}} changes, that originated from the LE5. It switched to the higher-strength Gen II block and {{received a}} revised cylinder head (enlarged exhaust ports) and camshaft design (increased exhaust valve duration). The engine also switched from wasted spark ignition to individual coil-on-plug ignition, this forced the cam cover to be redesigned. It was also switched to an E37 engine controller with new <b>crank</b> and cam <b>sensors</b> (replacing timing sensor previously found in ignition cassette). These changes increase horsepower slightly and allow the engine to meet PZEV standards. Compression ratio is 10.0:1 ...|$|R
50|$|A {{method of}} anti-lag {{developed}} {{along the same}} technique previously mentioned, but designed only to allow reduction of turbo lag when a car is initially pulling away from a standing start. These systems can {{be integrated into the}} engine management or existing anti-lag system, or can be fitted as a standalone unit. The basic method of operation is to artificially lower the engine rev limiter to hold the engine at a speed where the turbo can produce usable boost, by altering the ignition. Because the ignition is alternately cut or retarded, there is similar noise and misfires associated with other anti-lag systems.Systems for two-step launch designed to be fitted in addition to the existing engine management work by interrupting the <b>crank</b> position <b>sensor</b> signal, so that the engine develops a controlled misfire at a pre-determined RPM. The basic premise of the launch control system is to build positive boost pressure from a static engine, releasing full or increased power to the wheels when the car starts to move off. It is most commonly used in turbocharged drag cars, primarily in the US, Australia, Puerto Rico and Japan, although most WRC cars utilise launch control to ensure that the cars can get off the line much more quickly.|$|R
50|$|The 5S-FE was {{available}} in several variations each being distinguished by valve cover design. The first generation, introduced in the 1990-92 Celica GT/GT-S and MR2, had a power rating of 130 hp and 144 lbs-ft/torque. The second generation was introduced in 1993 with the fifth generation (ST184) Celica, and continued through the sixth generation (ST204) Celica. The second generation was also used in the MR2 (SW21) and Camry/Scepter (XV10) series and had a power output of 135 hp and 145 lbs-ft/torque. It had slightly less aggressive cams, no cold start injector, a knock sensor, and more aggressive tuning to give it slightly more power. In states that had adopted California emission standards the 5S-FE was rated at 130 hp and 145 lbs-ft/torque due mainly to emission equipment used to meet those emission regulations. The third generation was the last 5S-FE engine produced and {{was used in the}} 1997-01 Camry XV20 and 1999-01 Camry Solara; however, from 1996 onward, the engine received a <b>crank</b> angle <b>sensor</b> instead of a cam angle sensor for a smoother idle. From 1997 to 1999 the engine produced 133 hp at 5,200 rpm and 147 lbs-ft/torque at 4,400 rpm. From 2000 to 2001, the engine received modest improvements to increase power output to 136 hp at 5,200 rpm and 150 lbs-ft/torque at 4,400 rpm. The 5S-FE was replaced in all applications by the 2.4 L 2AZ-FE.|$|R
40|$|Air {{pollution}} from the diesel exhaust emission gives a bad effect {{to health and}} environment around the world. The content of the emission mostly harmful gases such as Nitrogen Oxide (NOx), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Hydrocarbon (HC) and Particulate Matter (PM). This thesis is aim to reduce diesel exhaust emission by using first stage seawater spray system. A spray chamber designed to setup together with the diesel engine for diesel experiment. The chamber {{is connected to the}} exhaust manifold to collect emission gas by using particle trap. Then, the emission data without seawater (WOS), with seawater (WS), and with electrolyzed seawater (WES) spray system for five variable engine speeds is analyzed using exhaust gas analyzer. The temperature change is also measured. The result had shown the comparison of emission concentration for three condition seawater sprays system in form of graph of emission concentration versus engine speeds. Most of the emission is reduce after flow through the spray chamber except for the oxygen that is increasing because of the additional oxygen in the seawater. The other emission is absorb by the alkaline seawater and dissolved in the seawater. The research had shown the effectiveness of alkaline seawater as a medium to reduce diesel exhaust emission. The emission WES spray is reducing more compares WS spray system. Furthermore, this research would also plan to add <b>crank</b> angle <b>sensor</b> on the engine to measure engine performance and study on content of waste seawater of this system...|$|R
50|$|FSAE Michigan 2011 Dynamic EventsThe {{day before}} the {{competition}} was the first drive of RFR11 which {{ended up with the}} Electromotive ECU <b>crank</b> position <b>sensor</b> to move slightly inside the crank case, hitting the crank trigger wheel, which led to an engine failure. The sensor was replaced overnight and a new wheel was welded on. The engine was not fired until the 2nd day of the competition after the technical inspections. On the 3rd day, the engine fired ok for the first acceleration event but the starter wheel gave out (possibly due to a misalignment during installation). The team replaced the engine within 1.5 hours {{to make it to the}} AutoX event in the afternoon, but had to skip Skid-Pad event. First driver successfully completed the AutoX run and the second driver did not complete his 2nd run after the engine started over-heating due to an electrical failure on the radiator fan. FSAE Michigan 2011 EnduranceThe first driver completed the first half of the event with no problems. As he was getting out of the car, he instructed the second driver to be cautious and take it slow. The second driver conducted his stint at mainly part throttle and through corners would hold the clutch in and then keep the RPMs high due to the belief that the engine was dying. The car was running ok but the 2nd driver was black flagged and had to pull in because of a malfunctioning brake light switch. As pulling in the pit lane, the driver quickly realized the problem and was able to pull back the brake pedal with his foot in order to be able to finish the rest of the race. For the remaining of the race, the driver pulled the brake pedal back with his foot every time he hit the brakes, which resulted him with very slow laptimes. Since the car was not tuned well for the RPM range that the driver was keeping the car at, the car ran out of fuel and DNF'ed from Endurance 2 laps before it could finish.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{work performed}} during a thirty month project which involves {{the production of}} dimethyl ether (DME) on-site for use as an ignition-improving additive in a compression-ignition natural gas engine. A single cylinder spark ignition engine was converted to compression ignition operation. The engine was then fully instrumented with a cylinder pressure transducer, <b>crank</b> shaft position <b>sensor,</b> airflow meter, natural gas mass flow sensor, and an exhaust temperature sensor. Finally, the engine was interfaced with a control system for pilot injection of DME. The engine testing is currently in progress. In addition, a one-pass process to form DME from natural gas was simulated with chemical processing software. Natural gas is reformed to synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide), converted into methanol, and finally to DME in three steps. Of additional benefit to the internal combustion engine, the offgas from the pilot process can be mixed with the main natural gas charge {{and is expected to}} improve engine performance. Furthermore, a one-pass pilot facility was constructed to produce 3. 7 liters/hour (0. 98 gallons/hour) DME from methanol in order to characterize the effluent DME solution and determine suitability for engine use. Successful production of DME led to an economic estimate of completing a full natural gas-to-DME pilot process. Additional experimental work in constructing a synthesis gas to methanol reactor is in progress. The overall recommendation from this work is that natural gas to DME is not a suitable pathway to improved natural gas engine performance. The major reasons are difficulties in handling DME for pilot injection and the large capital costs associated with DME production from natural gas...|$|R
40|$|The {{in-cylinder}} {{pressure is}} an important signal that gives information about the combustion process. To further improve engine performance, this information {{can be used as}} a feedback signal in a control system. Usually a pressure sensor is mounted in the cylinder to extract this information. A drawback with pressure sensors is that they are expensive and have issues with aging. This master’s thesis investigates the possibility to create a virtual sensor to estimate in-cylinder pressure based on <b>crank</b> angle degree <b>sensor</b> (CAD-sensor) data and physical models of the heavy-duty engine. Instead of using the standard mounted CAD-sensor an optical high-precision sensor measures the elapsed time between equidistant angles. Based on this signal the instantaneous angular acceleration was estimated. Together with the inertia of the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons, an estimation of the engine torque was calculated. To be able to extract in-cylinder pressure from the estimated torque, knowledge about how the in-cylinder pressure signal propagates in the drivetrain to accelerate the flywheel needs to be known. Two engine models based on the torque balance on the crankshaft are presented. The fundamental difference between them is how the crankshaft is modeled, rigid body or spring-mass-damper system. The latter captures torsional effects of the crankshaft. Comparisons between the estimated torque from sensor data and the two engine models are presented. It is found that torsional effects of the crankshaft is present at normal engine speeds and has a significant influence on the flywheel torque. A separation of the gas torque contribution from one cylinder is done with CAD-sensor data together with the rigid body engine model. The in-cylinder pressure is then estimated by using the inverse crank-slider function and a Kalman filter estimator. The estimated pressure captures part of the compression and most of the expansion at engine speeds below 1200 RPM. Due to the crank-slider geometry the pressure signal disappears at TDC. The torsional effects perturb the estimated pressure during the gas exchange cycle. Further development must be made if this method is to be used on heavy-duty applications in the future...|$|R
50|$|The Trionic system lacks a {{camshaft}} position sensor. This sensor {{is normally}} {{a prerequisite for}} a sequential pre ignition/pinging regulation and fuel injection. Saab Trionic must decide whether cylinder one or cylinder four ignites when the <b>crank</b> shaft position <b>sensor</b> indicates that cylinder one and four is at TDC. This is done by help of ionization current. One of the poles of the secondary coil of the spark coils {{is connected to the}} spark plugs in an ordinary manner. The other pole isn’t grounded directly but connected to an 80 V voltage. This means that an 80 V voltage is applied across the spark gap of the spark plugs, except when the spark is fired. When combustion has occurred the temperature in the combustion chamber is very high. The gases are formed as ions and start to conduct electric current. This results in a current flowing in the spark plug gap (without resulting in a spark). The ionisation current is measured in pairs, cylinder one and two is one pair and cylinder three and four in the other pair. If combustion occurs in cylinder one or two the ignition cassette sends battery voltage (B+) pulse to the ECU, pin 17. If the combustion takes place in cylinder three or four the B+ pulse is fed to pin 18 in ECU. If the crankshaft position sensor indicates that cylinders one and four are at TDC and a B+ pulse enters the ECU via pin 17 simultaneously, then the ECU know that it is cylinder one that has ignited. Upon starting, the ECU doesn’t know which cylinder is in compression phase, hence ignition is initiated in both cylinders one and four and 180 crank shaft degrees later sparks in cylinder two and three are fired. As soon as the combustion signals enters the ECU via pin 17 and pin 18 the ignition and fuel injection is synchronised to the engines firing order. The combustion signals are also used to detect misfires.|$|R
