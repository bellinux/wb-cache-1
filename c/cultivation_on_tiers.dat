30|$|The {{cellobiose}} lipid of Cryptococcus humicola, 16 -(tetra-O-acetyl-β-cellobiosyloxy)- 2 -hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, is {{a natural}} fungicide. Sensitivity of the cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the fungicide depends on a carbon source. Cellobiose lipid concentrations inducing the leakage of potassium ions and ATP were similar for the cells grown in the medium with glucose and ethanol. However, the cells grown on glucose and ethanol died at 0.05 mg ml- 1 and 0.2 mg ml- 1 cellobiose lipid, respectively. Inorganic polyphosphate (PolyP) synthesis was 65 % of the control with 0.05 mg ml- 1 cellobiose lipid during <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> ethanol. PolyP synthesis was not observed during the <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> glucose at the same cellobiose lipid concentration. The content of longer-chain polyP was higher during <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> ethanol. We speculate the long-chained polyP participate in the viability restoring of ethanol-grown cells after treatment with the cellobiose lipid.|$|R

40|$|Long-term {{effects of}} {{complete}} deep-soil <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> forest growth and yield were evaluated {{in an experiment}} initiated in 1988 on six different sites in Sweden. Complete deep-soil cultivation was compared with less intensive site preparation. Ten years after the start. growth. stand structure. damage and survival were evaluated. Conifer seedling growth and survival on sandy sites, frost-prone sites or both. generally increased following deep-soil cultivation compared to patch scarification. Silty sites exposed to summer frost mere also positively affected by deep-soil cultivation. although the risk of frost-heaving increased. For deciduous seedlings the result varied. but survival in birch was improved by deep-soil <b>cultivation.</b> <b>On</b> former farmland. deep cultivation may effectively control competing vegetation. Deep-soil cultivation in strips over half the area appeared to be as efficient as complete treatment. This has financial and environmental implications. Deep cultivation reduced variability in tree size, since it provided a more uniform environment during stand establishment. When long-term effects of complete deep-soil <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> forest growth and yield are evaluated. the significant differences in stand establishment demonstrated in the study must be considered.

40|$|Yeast {{production}} on hydrolysate is a likely process solution in large-scale ethanol production from lignocellulose. The hydrolysate {{will be available}} on site, and the yeast has furthermore been shown to acquire an increased inhibitor tolerance when cultivated on hydrolysate. However, due to over-flow metabolism and inhibition, efficient yeast {{production on}} hydrolysate can only be achieved by well-controlled substrate addition. In the present work, a method was developed for controlled addition of hydrolysate to PDU (process development unit) -scale aerobic fed-batch cultivations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae TMB 3000. A feed rate control strategy, which maintains the ethanol concentration at a low constant level, was adapted to process-like conditions. The ethanol concentration was obtained from on-line measurements of the ethanol mole fraction in the exhaust gas. A computer model of the system was developed to optimize control performance. Productivities, biomass yields, and byproduct formation were evaluated. The feed rate control worked satisfactorily and maintained the ethanol concentration close to the setpoint during the cultivations. Biomass yields of 0. 45 g/g were obtained on added hexoses during <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> hydrolysate and of 0. 49 g/g during <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> a synthetic medium with glucose as the carbon source.
