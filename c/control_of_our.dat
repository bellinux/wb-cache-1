Early in their career, their 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline entered the UK Singles Chart, but financial issues prevented the band from printing enough records to satisfy demand. When Elektra Records was closed down by Warner Bros. Records in 2004, Stereolab was dropped {{along with many}} other artists, reportedly because of poor sales. Since then, Stereolab's self-owned label Duophonic has inked a worldwide distribution deal with independent label Too Pure. Through Duophonic the band both licenses their music and releases it directly (depending on geographic market).

In 1997, Pason called auto insurance [...] "a regressive tax against working people". Moore was also vocal of his support for public healthcare and socialized medicine. Moore believes that capitalism is a system based on both exploitation and selfishness, which operates to serve the interests of corporations and the ruling class, at the expense of workers and the poor. During his presidential campaign he claimed that the lack of available remedy to collapsing economic conditions stems from the capitalist system's foundation upon [...] "greed", and advocated its replacement with a new system founded upon economic democracy through social ownership and workers' <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> reigning industrial and financial institutions.|$|E

[...] The Workshop defended the acceptance of corporate sponsorship, stating that it compensated for a decrease of government subsidies and financial assistance by PBS. Also during 1998, the Workshop invested $25 million in the cable channel Noggin, initiated during 1999 by the Workshop and Viacom's Nickelodeon. During 2000, the profit the CTW earned from the deal, along with its 1998 revenue caused partly by the [...] "Tickle Me Elmo" [...] craze, enabled the CTW to purchase The Jim Henson Company's rights to the Sesame Street Muppets from the German media company EM.TV, which had acquired Henson earlier that year. The transaction, valued at $180 million, also included a small interest Henson had in the Noggin cable channel. Gary Knell stated, [...] "Everyone, most especially the puppeteers, were thrilled that we were able to bring them home. It protected Sesame Street and allowed our international expansion to continue.

[...] Also in The Daily Telegraph, Charles Moore wrote that the book [...] "tries to do two things at once. One is to bash up modern militant atheism with all the author's polemical skill. The other is to give an autobiographical account of how, in our time, an intelligent man's faith may recover". In a positive review in Standpoint magazine, Michael Nazir Ali wrote, [...] "One of the abiding canards nailed by Peter Hitchens is that religion causes conflict. He does this by showing that so-called [...] "religious" [...] wars had many other elements to them, such as greed for territory, political ambition and nationalism. His repeated references to Soviet brutality reveal that secular ideologies have caused more suffering in recent times than any conflict associated with religion." [...] In a more critical review in the New Statesman Sholto Byrnes wrote, [...] "Hitchens makes his case forcefully, passionately and intelligently", but [...] "makes too much connection between the ill deeds of atheists and their atheism". Byrnes also reviewed the book in The Independent, where he questioned the validity of a number of Hitchens's conclusions, including that [...] "atheists 'actively wish for disorder and meaninglessness'". In a sympathetic review in The Guardian, Rupert Shortt wrote, [...] "Hitchens does not seek to mount a comprehensive defence of Christianity. He is wise to avoid deeper philosophical and theological waters, because his strengths lie elsewhere. His more manageable aim is to expose what he holds to be three major fallacies underlying God Is Not Great: that conflict fought in the name of religion is really always about faith; that [...] "it is ultimately possible to know with confidence what is right and what is wrong without acknowledging the existence of God"; and that [...] "atheist states are not actually atheist". In The Spectator, Quentin Letts reviewed the book very positively, describing it as [...] "a magnificent, sustained cry against the aggressive secularism taking <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> weakened culture".|$|E

[...] The Ottoman Sultan used his position as [...] to order the Sulu Sultan not to resist and not fight the Americans when they were invaded by Americans. President McKinley did not mention the Ottoman role in the pacification of the Sulu Moros in his address to the first session of the Fifty-sixth Congress in December 1899 since the agreement with the Sultan of Sulu was not submitted to the Senate until December 18. Despite the sultan [...] "pan-Islamic" [...] ideology, he readily acceded to Straus's request to avoid hostilities between the West and Muslims. The Sulu sultan was persuaded by the Ottoman Sultan. John P. Finley wrote that, After due consideration of these facts, the Sultan, as Caliph caused a message to be sent to the Mohammedans of the Philippine Islands forbidding them to enter into any hostilities against the Americans, inasmuch as no interference with their religion would be allowed under American rule. As the Moros have never asked more than that, it is not surprising, that they refused all overtures made, by Aguinaldo's agents, {{at the time of the}} Filipino insurrection. President McKinley sent a personal letter of thanks to Mr. Straus for the excellent work he had done, and said, its accomplishment had saved the United States at least twenty thousand troops in the field.
