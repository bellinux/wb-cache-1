5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most <b>common</b> <b>indicator</b> minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E
500|$|The long nasal vowels are iinh (...) , enh (...) , aanh (...) , and oonh (...) [...] They most {{commonly}} {{occur in the}} final syllable of nouns with diminutive suffixes or words with a diminutive connotation, {{as well as in}} the suffix (y)aanh (}}) 'first person (Conjunct) Animate Intransitive'. Orthographically the long vowel is followed by word-final nh to indicate that the vowel is nasal; while n is a <b>common</b> <b>indicator</b> of nasality in many languages such as French, the use of h is an orthographic convention and does not correspond to an independent sound. One analysis treats the long nasal vowels as phonemic, while another treats them as derived from sequences of long vowel followed by [...] and underlying the latter sound is converted to [...] or deleted. A study of the Southwestern Ojibwe (Chippewa) dialect spoken in Minnesota describes the status of the analogous vowels as unclear, noting that while the distribution of the long nasal vowels is restricted, there is a minimal pair distinguished only by the nasality of the vowel: giiwe [...] "he goes home" [...] and giiwenh [...] "so the story goes". Other discussions of Ottawa phonology and phonetics are silent on the issue.|$|E

This type presents with exercise-induced muscle cramps and weakness (sometimes rhabdomyolysis), myoglobinuria, as well as with haemolytic anaemia causing dark urine a few hours later.Hyperuricemia is common, due to the kidneys' inability to process uric acid following damage resulting from processing myoglobin.
