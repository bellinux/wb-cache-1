40|$|A shaking force {{balanced}} mechanism is a mechanism {{that does not}} exert dynamic re-action forces to its base and to its surrounding for any motion. For mobile mechanisms such as exoskeletons, humanoid robots, drones, and anthropomorphic hands force balance is an important property for, among others, their dynamic behavior, stability, safety, control, and low energy consumption. For the design of {{force balanced}} mechanisms with multiple <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> {{it can be a}} significant challenge to obtain the balance conditions, especially when the mechanism consists of <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> that depend on other <b>closed</b> <b>loops.</b> In this paper it is shown how with mass equivalent modeling the force balance conditions can be derived of a complex multi-degree-of-freedom parallel mechanism with multiple <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> of which one or more depend on other <b>closed</b> <b>loops.</b> It is shown how such a mechanism can be divided in mass equivalent linkages such as mass equivalent dyads and mass equivalent triads for which each can be analyzed individually with principal vectors and linear momentum equations...|$|R

25|$|In other dimensions, the {{constant}} B changes, {{but the same}} constant appears both in the t flow and in the coupling flow. The {{reason is that the}} derivative with respect to t of the <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> with a single vertex is a <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> with two vertices. This means that the only difference between the scaling of the coupling and the t is the combinatorial factors from joining and splitting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Load {{resonant}} converter topologies {{are very}} popular {{and used to}} increase circuit switching speeds, allowing the cost of circuit magnetics to be reduced, while still keeping switching losses to a minimum. In this paper a new open <b>loop</b> and <b>close</b> <b>loop</b> control method for 2. 1 kW Series Loaded Resonant DC-DC converter operated in above resonant mode is presented. A voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is used to regulate the DC output voltage of converter in open loop. The control circuit used to regulate the output voltage of SLR converter is frequency modulation technique in which switching frequency of the converter is varied to regulate the output voltage. The <b>close</b> <b>loop</b> variable frequency control mainly consists of feedback loop and PI regulator with VCO. VCO is a voltage-to-frequency converter used to convert error in output voltage in change of frequency to control the voltage in <b>close</b> <b>loop</b> system. The simulation results for both open <b>loop</b> and <b>close</b> <b>loop</b> control methods are also {{presented in this paper}} to verify the control concept.

40|$|<b>Closed</b> {{kinematic}} <b>loops</b> {{occur in}} many different robotic systems.
