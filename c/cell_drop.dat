40|$|Several studies {{concerning}} {{the performances of}} TCP over UBR service have shown that ATM switches with limited buffers respond to UBR congestion with a low throughput and high unfairness. In order to achieve a higher efficiency {{it is possible to}} implement some additional mechanism to control <b>cells</b> <b>dropping</b> at buffers switches. One of the most popular drop strategy is the Early Packet Discard, which drops the entire higher level data units when the buffer queue reaches a certain threshold level. Another mechanism is the Partial Packet Discard, which, if a cell is lost in case of congestion, discards all the subsequent cells belonging to the same packet. The first investigations of the throughput behaviour of TCP over ATM with EPD, using simulation studies, have shown a performance improvement.

40|$|This work employs an {{approximate}} Markov chain to analyze that a parallel packet switch (PPS) can emulate a first-come first-served (FCFS) output-queued (OQ) packet switch only operating {{slower than the}} external line rate. The PPS comprises multiple packet switches operating independently and in parallel. The PPS class is characterized by deployment of parallel center-stage switches with memory buffers running slower than the external line rate. Each lower speed packet switch operates {{at a fraction of}} the external line rate R. For example, each packet switch can operate at internal line rate R/K, where K is the number of center-stage switches. This work presents a proposed novel Markov chain model successfully exhibits these performance characteristics for throughput, cell delay and <b>cell</b> <b>drop</b> rate. This novel Markov chain model extends from our previous paper [Chia-Lung Liu, Woei Lin, Performance analysis of the sliding-window parallel packet switch, in: IEEE 40 th International Conference on Communications 2005, ICC 2005, May 16 - 20, 2005; Chia-Lung Liu, Woei Lin, Evaluation and analysis of the sliding-window parallel packet switch, in: IEEE 19 th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications, AINA, vol. 2, 2005, pp. 355 - 358].

40|$|Abstract Beluga is a single-chip switch architec-ture {{specifically}} {{targeted at}} local area ATM networks, and it features three architectural innovations. First, an interconnection hierarchy composed of multiple switch-ing fabrics {{is built into}} the chip to provide both low-latency cell transfer when the traffic is light and low <b>cell</b> <b>drop</b> rate under heavy load. Secondly, to improve sili-con efficiency, Beluga is based on shared memory archi-tecture, and the buffers are implemented using DRAM rather than SRAM technology. Heavy interleaving and selective invalidation are used to address long latency and periodic refreshing problems, respectively. Thirdly, Beluga supports multicast with minimal physical bit replication. It also separates support for unicast and multicast cells to optimize for the common case, where multicast cells occur infrequently. This paper describes the design details of Beluga and the results of a compre-hensive simulation study to quantify the performance impact of each of its architectural features. The most important result from this research is that DRAM-based buffer implementation significantly reduces the cell-drop rate during heavy while exhibiting almost identical cell latency to SRAM-based implementation during light load. Therefore, we believe DRAM makes an attractive alternative for switch buffer implementation, especially for single-chip architecture such as Beluga. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} TCP connections over ATM networks without ATM-level congestion control, and {{compare it to the}} performance of TCP over packet-based networks. For simulations of congested networks, the effective throughput of TCP over ATM can be quite low when <b>cells</b> are <b>dropped</b> at the congested ATM switch. The low throughput is due to wasted bandwidth as the congested link transmits cells from `corrupted' packets, i. e., packets in which at least one <b>cell</b> is <b>dropped</b> by the switch.

Partial Packet Discard, in which remaining cells are discarded after one <b>cell</b> has been <b>dropped</b> from a packet, improves throughput somewhat.

40|$|Background. Haemodialysis with bioincompatible mem-branes led to {{transient}} leukocyte activation and intra-dialytic leukopenia due to endothelial adherence. After {{the introduction}} of biocompatible membranes, only CD 16 + (i. e. CD 14 ++CD 16 + and CD 14 (+) CD 16 +) monocytes showed an impressive transient intra-dialytic decrease. Presently, {{it is unclear whether}} this CD 16 + monocyte drop is detrimental. We investigated whether a prominent intra-dialytic decrease of CD 16 + monocytes predicts future car-diovascular (CV) events. Methods. We measured leukocyte and monocyte subpopu-lations in 70 patients before and 10 min after haemodialy-sis initiation. Patients were stratified by their intra-dialytic CD 14 ++CD 16 + monocyte drop (pre-defined major drop: decline of cell counts at 10 min to 50 % of pre-dialytic counts). Patients were followed up for 42 ± 2 months; endpoints were CV events and death. Results. Patients with a minor CD 14 ++CD 16 + monocyte drop had more CV events than patients with a major drop. Inmultivariate analysis, a minor CD 14 ++CD 16 + monocyte drop was the strongest independent predictor of future CV events [hazard ratio 2. 405 (95 % CI 1. 192 – 4. 854) ]. Conclusions.

40|$|The single-chip crosspoint-queued (CQ) switch is {{a compact}} {{switching}} architecture {{that has all}} its buffers placed at the crosspoints of input and output lines. Scheduling is also performed inside the switching core, and does not rely on latency-limited communications with input or output line-cards.

However, the crosspoint buffers are small and segregated, thus how to efficiently use the buffers and avoid packet drops remains a major problem {{that needs to be}} addressed. In this paper, we consider load balancing, deflection routing, and buffer pooling for efficient buffer sharing in the CQ switch.
