40|$|Custom high-definition {{silicone}} restorations and <b>cosmetic</b> <b>covers</b> for prostheses {{are intended}} to match {{the appearance of the}} user’s sound-side limb. In addition to the physical characteristics, the cover must match the user’s skin color. This color match is a difficult process and traditionally has been done subjectively by the practitioner attempting to match standard color swatches to the patient’s skin tone. Ambient light and the practitioner’s judgment affect this process. A new portable spectrophotometer has been developed to solve this problem. It measures the color, removing the subjectivity from the process. These measurements have 5 times greater resolution than the color swatch approach. It also blocks ambient light and provides its own broad-spectrum light to assure a good color match across the entire optical spectrum. As a result, the color match will be good regardless of the lighting condition during the evaluation. This approach substantially improves the process, resulting in a better color match and greater acceptance by the user...|$|R

40|$|Designing and {{developing}} a cosmesis solution that maintains mechanical and environmental durabil-ity while minimizing mechanical drag and allowing sensor function was {{the crux of the}} challenge. For the BACKGROUND A cosmesis is the last component to be placed on a prosthetic arm, hand, or both, and it is the first com-ponent that others interact with, either visually or by contact. Historically, the cosmesis has had two primary functions. The first has been to provide a <b>cosmetic</b> <b>cover</b> over the nonhuman-appearing mechanism of the pros-thetic limb. This cover helps the patient feel more com-fortable in social settings (Fig. 1). The second function has been to provide a better gripping surface than that of the underlying mechanism for the hand to promote picking up and holding objects. In the work described in this article, we imposed other requirements, such as pro-viding a first barrier against the environment and allow-ing sensors to measure force, vibration, and temperature through the cosmesis. cosmesis fulfills multiple functions, from providing a cos-metic covering to increase social acceptance to improving the gripping capability of a prosthetic hand. This article explores the requirements imposed on the cosmesis developed for the Revolutionizing Prosthetics (RP) 2009 program and looks at the dual glove-solution path that evolved during the development and testing. The requirements are drivers for the materials selection, and the processing method that was selected is an evolution of traditional cosmesis fabrication. Future directions in cosmesis fabrication are discussed...|$|E

40|$|A new gait {{training}} device {{has been developed}} to provide auditory feedback of knee angle information to above-knee and hip disarticulation amputees. Traditionally, new amputees have relied on visual feedback of knee position during gait training (van Griethuysen, 1979). This auditory feedback system {{eliminates the need for}} visual feedback by providing a frequency encoded tone corresponding to knee angle. Operation The system is designed to produce a tone which increases in frequency as the knee flexes. When the knee is fully extended there is an absence of sound. As the knee is slightly flexed (less than 2 °) a tone of approximately 60 Hz is generated. This frequency increases linearly with knee flexion up to 600 Hz which corresponds to the knee being flexed to 70 °. With flexion over 70 ° the tone is absent so as to allow the patient to sit without having to turn off the unit. During the swing phase of gait there is constant auditory feedback which can be beneficial in establishing an even, repeatable cadence. In addition, the absence of sound at full extension indicates that it is safe for the amputee to place the heel down. The electronic operation of the device is quite simple and is outlined in Figure 1. The voltage from the potentiometer is amplified and then inputted to a voltage comparator and also to a voltage controlled oscillator. If the voltage corresponds to an angle between 2 ° and 70 ° the voltage controlled oscillator is enabled and produces a tone. Description The knee angle feedback system consists of a single turn potentiometer with a miniature cable connecting it to a small belt box containing the electronics and a loudspeaker. As an alternative to the loudspeaker, a modified hearing aid earpiece can be used. The potentiometer can be mounted either directly at the pivot point on a prosthesis (Fig. 2) or between two aluminium brackets which strap above and below the prosthetic knee (Fig. 3). The attachment method is used only on prostheses that have been fitted with <b>cosmetic</b> <b>covers.</b> Discussion This angular feedback system was originally designed {{to be used as a}} permanent system with...|$|R
40|$|Current {{articulating}} {{electric and}} body-powered hands {{have a lower}} pinch force (15 – 34 N) than electric hands with stiff fingers (55 – 100 N). The <b>cosmetic</b> glove, which <b>covers</b> a hand prosthesis, negatively affects the mechanical efficiency of a prosthesis. The goal {{of this study is}} to mechanically compare polyvinylchloride (PVC) and silicone cosmetic gloves and quantify the stiffness of the finger joints, the required actuation energy, and the energy dissipation during joint articulation. Six cosmetic gloves, identical in size but made from different materials, were mechanically tested: three PVC and three silicone. The silicone gloves required less work and dissipated less energy during flexing. They also had a lower joint stiffness and required a lower maximum joint torque. Based on energy requirements, joint stiffness, and required joint torque, the tested silicone glove is most suitable for application on an articulating hand prosthesis.

Some {{of the laws}} banning FGM, including in Canada and the US, focus only on minors, but several countries, including Sweden and the UK, have banned it regardless of consent, and that legislation does seem to <b>cover</b> <b>cosmetic</b> procedures. Sweden, for example, has banned operations [...] "on the outer female sexual organs {{with a view to}} mutilating them or bringing about some other permanent change in them, {{regardless of whether or not}} consent has been given for the operation".

40|$|Since {{the recent}} Global Financial Crisis (GFC) {{attention}} on corporate fiscal contributions has grown substantially {{and discussion of}} the appropriateness of corporate tax practices {{is now part of}} the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) agenda (Hardeck & Hertl, 2014; Preuss, 2012; Sikka, 2010). The alleged irresponsibility of current corporate tax practices has been documented in the international press (e. g. The Economist, 2016) and some corporates have responded by disclosing tax contributions in their non-financial reports to show their positive impacts on society (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2010). Such responses have been criticized as merely <b>cosmetic</b> attempts to <b>cover</b> up systematic irresponsibility that is manifested in the (ab) use of international tax loopholes (Ylönen & Laine, Forthcoming). Notwithstanding the value of these critiques, ‘day-to-day’ tax minimization remains unquestioned and is essentially regarded as good business practice (Brown, 2011). This might be the case because, as Dowling suggests, “the payment of tax is not viewed as socially responsible in the way that other CSR activities are” (2014 : 8) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Cosmetic</b> gloves that <b>cover</b> a {{prosthetic}} hand have a parasitic positive stiffness that counteracts the flexion of a finger joint. Objectives: Reducing the required input torque {{to move a}} finger of {{a prosthetic}} hand by compensating the parasitic stiffness of the cosmetic glove. Study design: Experimental, test bench. Methods: The parasitic positive stiffness and the required input torques of a polyvinyl chloride glove and a silicone glove were measured when flexing a metacarpophalangeal finger joint for 90 °. To compensate this positive stiffness, an adjustable compensation mechanism with a negative stiffness was designed and built. A MATLAB model was created to predict the optimal settings of the mechanism, {{based on the measured}} stiffness, in order to minimize the required input torque of the total system. The mechanism was tested in its optimal setting with an applied glove. Results: The mechanism reduced the required input torque by 58 % for the polyvinyl chloride glove and by 52 % for the silicone glove. The total energy dissipation of the joint did not change significantly. Conclusions: This study shows that the undesired positive stiffness in the joint can be compensated with a relatively simple negative stiffness mechanism, which fits inside a finger of a standard cosmetic glove. Clinical relevance This study presents a mechanism that compensates the undesired stiffness of cosmetic gloves on prosthetic hands. As a result, it requires less input force, torque and energy to move the fingers. Application of this mechanism in body-powered hands will reduce the control effort of the user.
