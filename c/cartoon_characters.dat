40|$|Cartoons play {{important}} roles in many areas, but it {{requires a lot of}} labor to produce new cartoon clips. In this paper, we propose a gesture recognition method for <b>cartoon</b> <b>character</b> images with two applications, namely content-based cartoon image retrieval and cartoon clip synthesis. We first define Edge Features (EF) and Motion Direction Features (MDF) for <b>cartoon</b> <b>character</b> images. The features are classified into two different groups, namely intra-features and inter-features. An Unsupervised Bi-Distance Metric Learning (UBDML) algorithm is proposed to recognize the gestures of <b>cartoon</b> <b>character</b> images. Different from the previous research efforts on distance metric learning, UBDML learns the optimal distance metric from the heterogeneous distance metrics derived from intra-features and inter-features. Content-based <b>cartoon</b> <b>character</b> image retrieval and cartoon clip synthesis can be carried out based on the distance metric learned by UBDML. Experiments show that the <b>cartoon</b> <b>character</b> image retrieval has a high precision and that the cartoon clip synthesis can be carried out efficiently...|$|R

After the characters from the series were created, they were all shown to executive producer Steven Spielberg, who would decide which characters would make it into Animaniacs (the characters Buttons and Mindy were chosen by Spielberg's daughter).
