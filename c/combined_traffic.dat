Using the measures, they found that Tokyo and Rome are the most robust networks because of the many options for transfers which provides shorter transfers and more route choices. Feng et al.

This works presents the evaluation of TXOP duration limits based on IEEE 802. 11 e standard, and IEEE 802. 11 g for physical layer of ERP-OFDM and DSSS-OFDM technologies. HCCA 802. 11 e stated that superframe consists of Contention Free Period (CFP) and Contention Period (CP).
