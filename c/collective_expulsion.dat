40|$|The <b>collective</b> <b>expulsion</b> of foreigners, {{although}} {{prohibited by}} International Law, is {{a practice that}} has been systematically applied {{in the field of}} control of migration flows. In the case of Spain, on its southern land border, the so-called police "push-backs" have become widespread. The violations of rights entailed by these measures are incompatible with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, from which obligations derive for the States Parties. This paper proposes a critical analysis of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights to delimit when a <b>collective</b> <b>expulsion</b> occurs. This is intended to avoid the apparent normalization of a measure that is illegal and to insist on mechanisms that guarantee the rights of foreigners...|$|E

The cooperation collapsed following the outbreak of the Libyan civil war in 2011.

This presence was accompanied by political political power during the first eight centuries (since the conquest of Andalusia in 92 AH / 711 AD until the fall of Granada in 897 AH / 1492 AD), and then became the presence of large groups of Muslims spread throughout Spain carrying different names: The first Mudejares, then the Moriscos, {{did not have the}} political authority {{to take care of their}} affairs, but were merely subjects subject to Christian authority and subjected to various forms of persecution until finally the laws of <b>collective</b> <b>expulsion</b> were passed between 1609 and 1614.

And shows that what kept us by the many documents of the trials carried out by the Office of Inquisition inspections against those who were accused of maintaining Islam behind the guise of Christian synthesis. The last documents of these trials date back to the year 1729. Granada fell - the last of the Muslim castles in Spain - year (897 AH = 1492 AD), which was a harbinger of the fall of the Andalusian religious and social nation, and the dissipation of its intellectual and literary heritage. The tragedy of the Muslims there was one of the worst tragedies history; where that period witnessed acts of barbarism and brutality committed by the courts of investigation (inspection); to purge Spain of the effects of Islam and Muslims, and the annihilation of their heritage, which flourished in this country about eight centuries. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{position}} of Roma migrants in the EU presents an anomaly which challenges {{the foundations of}} European Union law. As Union citizens, European migrants are entitled to freedom of movement and residence in Member States. Yet the rights intended to secure this position have been routinely and selectively denied to Roma migrants, leading to forced evictions and <b>collective</b> <b>expulsions</b> without regard t o European Law. As has been evidenced in the UK, Roma arrivals are viewed with particularly acute suspicion; a response which reflects their double stigmatization as both immigrant and Roma. At the same time, Roma migration from new Member States has expo sed a contradiction inherent in the citizenship project which strikes {{at the heart of}} the Union ’s human rights credentials. The degree of exclusion and inequality faced by Europe’s largest minority in all Member States is the most pressing internal human rights issue facing the EU. Yet the European institutions continue to lack a coherent response and defined strategy. The current European framework demanding National Action Plans is commendable in that it prevents individual states from abdicating responsibility for the situation of their Roma citizens. Nevertheless, the absence of clear targets, Roma engagement and European leadership, suggest that this strategy is doomed to failure offering little more than a distraction. In a Union predicated on, inter alia, the rule of law, respect for human rights and the protection of minorities, this detached position undermines the legitimacy of the entire citizenship project...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} year the {{temporary}} holding centre for irregular migrants in Lampedusa, Italy's southernmost island, has been repeatedly denounced for instances of procedural irregularities and alleged human rights violations. The degrading treatment of third-country nationals, the difficulty in gaining access to the asylum determination process and the large scale expulsions to Libya, brought Lampedusa {{to the attention of}} European and international institutions. The European Parliament, the European Court of Human Rights and the United Nations' Human Rights Committee all called on Italy to refrain from <b>collective</b> <b>expulsions</b> of asylum seekers and irregular migrants to Libya and to respect asylum seekers' right to international protection. Using the material provided by the Italian authorities, European institutions and the NGOs, this study presents an overview of events and policies implemented by the Italian and Libyan Governments, the European Union and the International Organization for Migration and outlines the contentions surrounding these policies. The paper argues that the implementation of the detention and return schemes, commonly discussed in terms of the externalization of asylum, does not actually relocate the asylum procedures outside the EU's external borders but rather deprives asylum seekers of the possibility of accessing asylum determination procedure. My analysis of migratory patterns in Libya further suggests that these policies, implemented to deter irregular migratory flows into Europe and combat smuggling in migrants, might paradoxically result in 'illegalizing' the movement of migrants between Libya and the neighbouring African states and in increasing the involvement of smuggling networks. The study ends by raising the issue of the political responsibility of all actors involved, whether they are Governments, supranational bodies or agencies, and putting forward policy recommendations for an effective EU framework for the protection of asylum seekers...|$|R

The war could also have forced to leave many African immigrants residing in Libya, which used to be itself a destination country for migrants looking for better jobs. The 2013 Lampedusa migrant shipwreck involved [...] "more than 360" [...] deaths, leading the Italian government to establish Operation Mare Nostrum, a large-scale naval operation that involved search and rescue, with some migrants brought aboard a naval amphibious assault ship. In 2014, the Italian government ended the operation, calling the costs too large for one EU state alone to manage; Frontex assumed the main responsibility for search and rescue operations. The Frontex operation is called Operation Triton. The Italian government had requested additional funds from the EU to continue the operation but member states did not offer the requested support. The UK government cited fears that the operation was acting as [...] "an unintended 'pull factor', encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths". The operation consisted of two surveillance aircraft and three ships, with seven teams of staff who gathered intelligence and conducted screening/identification processing. Its monthly budget was estimated at €2.9 million.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} {{of the international community}} currently seems to alternate progressive impulses towards greater protection of human rights and sudden fallout in the traditional concept of territorial sovereignty. In a stage characterized by an increasingly restrictive admission of foreign nationals within the borders of the State and <b>collective</b> <b>expulsions,</b> what is the scope of the secular institution of asylum? Whether, on the one hand, the right of asylum is one of the state powers to freely adjust the entry and stay of aliens on its territory, considered as a corollary of territorial sovereignty, from the viewpoint of the individual it would constitute a means of further guarantee for fundamental rights. From this dilemma between state interest and human rights the present study will move to trace a possible balance between the protection of national security and the protection of human rights in one of the regions most affected by international migrations, like the euro-Mediterranean region. For these reasons, the hypothesis in this dissertation is the existence of a right of individuals to be granted asylum under International Human Rights and Refugee Law. The premise for this research is necessarily the assertion that individuals may be, even though only in part, subjects of International Law, as right holders vis-a-vis States. In conclusion, it is noted that attempts to claim a fundamental right to asylum, where have not engendered ad hoc set of laws, standing in provisions “still confused and often rudimentary”, they have contributed to conceive the right to asylum as a human right of subsidiary nature, likely to complete other inalienable rights, such as the right to life and physical integrity. The research is divided into 2 parts, including 2 chapters respectively. The first chapter develops the traditional theoretical framework under which the work is conducted. It examines the {{evolution of}} asylum through traditional international law and the study comes to identify, in the gradual emergence of a humanitarian nature of asylum, the symptoms of a change in the approach to such legal institution. The second chapter further elaborates on the possible evolution of asylum as a human right, assessing the course of non-refoulement and the jurisprudential contribution of the human rights treaty-monitoring bodies to the acceptance of a right to de facto asylum. The third chapter examines the legal developments in the field of asylum in the European Union, and how this special 'supra-national' legal order relates to the rights of refugees under International Refugee and Human Rights Law. The fourth chapter examines the legal conception of asylum in some other international organizations and legal systems of the Mediterranean and highlights the risks for an effective asylum-seeker protection, hidden in some bilateral readmission agreements...|$|R
