40|$|The {{behavior}} of sand {{was found to}} be governed by its chemical properties rather than its physical properties. Hence, it is important to determine the geochemistry properties of sand besides its physical properties. The thermal applied on the bentonite and kaolin is one of the important external elements for changing soil mechanical characteristics based on mineralogy and stress-strain relationship. It is for considering of mineralogy and mechanical properties of bentonite and kaolin to development a better construction material. To evaluation of bentonite clay and kaolin behavior when subjected to the thermal, several laboratory tests have been conducted to analysis of bentonite characteristics. This project aimed on determining the strength of sand, mixed with 0. 25 %, 0. 5 %, 1 % and 2 % of bentonite and kaolin with and without thermal added the bentonite and Kaolin for 300 'C for one hour. Bentonite and kaolin, in powdered forms, was mix with sand and compacted at optimum moisture content. The strength of the compacted samples was determined from direct shear test. It was observed that the material of bentonite and kaolin increased the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand.</b> The result shows that 1 % bentonite 300 'C gives higher shear strength of sand. This shows that the bentonite can be used to increase the strength soil than kaolin. This due to the fine nature of the materials that could fill the voids in the mixture but also contribute to decrease in friction angles...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises five manuscripts {{resulting from}} a study on a critical problem {{in the oil industry}} called 2 ̆ 2 Sanding 2 ̆ 2. Sanding is a phenomenon in which sand from a formation is drawn into a well during production and pumped along with oil and gas. This occurs in weakly cemented sands and sandstones, and can cause significant damage, including erosion of pipelines, loss of production, and in extreme cases the loss of oil wells. A knowledge of the strength of these formation is critical for the effective analysis <b>of</b> <b>sanding</b> potential and design of possible preventive measures. ^ The objective of this research is to develop a practical tool for estimating the strength <b>of</b> weakly cemented <b>sands</b> (i. e. unconfined compressive strength, real cohesion, and friction angle) from commonly measured geophysical logs (compression wave velocity, shear wave velocity, and porosity). To achieve this, an extensive laboratory testing program was conducted on artificially cemented samples of varying densities and levels of cementation. Geophysical measurements on these samples included bulk density and shear wave velocities. The laboratory testing program included triaxial compression tests, unconfined compression tests and indirect tension tests. Real cohesion and tangential friction angles were estimated using a nonlinear Mohr envelope. ^ Based on the laboratory results, four empirical models were developed that related small strain shear modulus or compression/shear wave velocity ratios with shear stresses at failure. Because in situ logs are influenced by environmental conditions, and pore fluid composition, a methodology was developed to estimate strength from synthetic velocities. This methodology has the potential to estimate the unconfined compressive strength, and real <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> weakly cemented <b>sand</b> directly from field measured porosity and compression wave velocity logs. ...|$|R

This paper presents the results of a study that investigated the influence <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> quality on the properties of fresh and hardened self-compacting concrete (SCC). The dune sands are very fine materials characterized by a high intergranular porosity, high surface area and low fineness modulus; on the other hand crushed (manufactured) sand has a high rate into thin and irregular shapes which are influencing the workability of concrete. The amount <b>of</b> dune <b>sand</b> varies from (0 % 50 %, to 100 %) by weight of fine aggregates. The effect of additions is also treated (blast furnace slag and lime stone) The results show that the rheological properties favour the use of dune sands; however the mechanical properties support the use <b>of</b> crushed <b>sand...</b>|$|R

No studies have researched the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> the ROK-U. S. alliance through robust empirical analysis. To answer this question empirically, this thesis examines three indicators for measuring the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> the ROK-U.

Similarly, the coupling between classes and objects always corresponds to classical (module-based) coupling. It is therefore a source of confusion to refer to object-oriented cohesion or object-oriented coupling. These results are then extended to object-oriented metrics in general. For a metric to be strictly object-oriented, it is necessary for that metric to be inheritance-related. But inheritance, though necessary, is not sufficient; for example, coupling in the object-oriented paradigm can be induced by inheritance, but is nevertheless always equivalent to coupling as it is found in the module-based (classical) paradigm.

Currently proposed measures for cohesion in Object-Oriented (OO) software reflect particular interpretations <b>of</b> <b>cohesion</b> and capture {{different aspects of}} it.

This paper proposes a new measure for the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> classes in OO software systems based on {{the analysis of the}} unstructured information embedded in the source code, such as comments and identifiers. The measure, named the Conceptual <b>Cohesion</b> <b>of</b> Classes (C 3), is inspired by the mechanisms used to measure textual coherence in cognitive psychology and computational linguistics.
