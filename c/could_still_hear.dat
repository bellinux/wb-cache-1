5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

5|$|In October 1932, Ravel {{suffered}} {{a blow to}} the head in a taxi accident. The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition. As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia. Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, Don Quixote (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score. Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée. The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription. Ravel composed no more after this. The exact nature of his illness is unknown. Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour, and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months. Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> music in his head.|$|E

Here a soldier was on guard, but he had fallen asleep for a moment in order to rest himself.

2500|$|A large {{collection}} of Beethoven's hearing aids, {{such as a}} special ear horn, can be viewed at the Beethoven House Museum in Bonn, Germany. Despite his obvious distress, Czerny remarked that Beethoven <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> speech and music normally until 1812. Around 1814 however, {{by the age of}} 44, Beethoven was almost totally deaf, and when a group of visitors saw him play a loud arpeggio of thundering bass notes at his piano remarking, [...] "Ist es nicht schön?" [...] (Is it not beautiful?), they felt deep sympathy considering his courage and sense of humour (he lost the ability to hear higher frequencies first).|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the issues}} debated in the {{drafting}} of the Constitution was the respective roles of the High Court and the Privy Council. The draft constitution that was put to voters in the various colonies {{was that there was}} to be no appeal to the Privy Council in any matter involving the interpretation of the Constitution or of the Constitution of a State, unless it involved the interests of some other dominion. This was not acceptable to the British, who insisted on a compromise. Section 74 as ultimately enacted by the Imperial Parliament provided that if the dispute was between the Commonwealth and a state as to the extent of their respective powers under the Constitution, there could only be an appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council if the High Court granted a certificate [...] "that the question is one which ought to be determined by Her Majesty in Council". It was anticipated that this may give rise to conflict between the High Court and the Privy Council because the Privy Council <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> an appeal directly from a state court. The view that was supported in the House of Lords was that the view of the Privy Council would prevail [...] "as it was the decision of Her Majesty herself as the fountain of justice, administering justice throughout her Empire at home and abroad.|$|E

30|$|The {{narratives}} {{convey a}} profound weight of responsibility {{felt by the}} participants. In stories of palliative care “done well” in a humanitarian setting, this weight felt lifted or at least lighter {{on the shoulders of}} participants. Many participants could not think of a case where palliative care was done well, but amongst those who could, their experience was a source of deep satisfaction. Providing effective palliative care “…allows the healthcare workers to feel that they are contributing and they haven’t failed” (P 6). However, even when care was done well, these encounters <b>could</b> <b>still</b> haunt participants as morally and existentially significant. For example, a nurse who had worked in an Ebola Treatment Centre described “a little girl, I think about the age of nine, and who called me, ‘Uncle can you hold my hand’, and because I knew that we could {{sit down and talk to}} them, so – which I did, and once I held her hand, she died… and so, for - for many, many months, even when I came [home], I <b>could</b> <b>still</b> feel that touch…I <b>could</b> <b>still</b> feel - <b>hear</b> that voice” (P 20). This experience stayed with him, and he described it as one factor in his seeking psychological support after returning from his field mission.|$|R
