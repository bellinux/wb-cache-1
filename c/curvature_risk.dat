40|$|We {{propose a}} Nelson-Siegel type {{interest}} rate term structure model where the underlying yield factors follow autoregressive processes with stochastic volatility. The factor volatilities parsimoniously capture risk inherent {{to the term}} structure and are associated with the time-varying uncertainty of the yield curve’s level, slope and curvature. Estimating the model based on U. S. government bond yields applying Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques we find that the factor volatilities follow highly persistent processes. We show that slope and <b>curvature</b> <b>risk</b> have explanatory power for bond excess returns and illustrate that the yield and volatility factors are closely related to industrial capacity utilization, inflation, monetary policy and employment growth.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a Nelson-Siegel type {{interest rate term structure}} model with the underlying yield factors following autoregressive processes revealing time-varying stochastic volatility. The factor volatilities capture risk inherent {{to the term}} struc- ture and are associated with the time-varying uncertainty of the yield curve’s level, slope and curvature. Estimating the model based on U. S. government bond yields applying Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques we find that the yield factors and factor volatilities follow highly persistent processes. Using the extracted factors to explain one-year-ahead bond excess returns we observe that the slope and cur- vature yield factors contain the same explanatory power as the return-forecasting factor recently proposed by Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005). Moreover, we identify slope and <b>curvature</b> <b>risk</b> as important additional determinants of future excess returns. Finally, we illustrate that the yield and volatility factors are closely con- nected to variables reflecting macroeconomic activity, inflation, monetary policy and employment growth. It is shown that the extracted yield curve components have long-term prediction power for macroeconomic fundamentals.

40|$|This paper quantifies how {{variation}} in real economic activity and inflation in the U. S. influenced the market prices of level, slope, and <b>curvature</b> <b>risks</b> in U. S. Treasury markets. To accomplish this we develop a novel arbitrage-free DT SM in which macroeconomic risks – in particular, real output and inflation risks – impact bond investment decisions separately from {{information about the}} shape of the yield curve. Estimates of our preferred macro-DT SM over the twenty-three year period from 1985 through 2007 reveal that unspanned macro risks explained a substantial proportion of the {{variation in}} forward terms premiums. Unspanned macro risks accounted for nearly 90 % of the conditional variation in short-dated forward term premiums, with unspanned real economic growth being the key driving factor. Over horizons beyond three years, these effects were entirely attributable to unspanned inflation. Using our model, we also reassess some of Chairman Bernanke’s remarks on the interplay between term premiums, {{the shape of the}} yield curve, and macroeconomic activity...|$|R
40|$|This paper quantifies how {{variation}} in real economic activity and inflation in the U. S. influenced the market prices of level, slope, and <b>curvature</b> <b>risks</b> in U. S. Treasury markets. We develop a novel arbitrage-free dynamic term structure {{model in which}} bond investment decisions are influenced by real output and inflation risks that are unspanned by (imperfectly correlated with) information about {{the shape of the}} Treasury yield curve. Our model reveals that, over the period 1985 – 2007, these unspanned macro risks accounted for {{a large portion of the}} {{variation in}} forward terms premiums, and there was pronounced cyclical variation in the market prices of level and slope risks. We compare fitted term premiums for the post- 2007 crisis period to those from a model with spanned macro risks, and use our findings to reassess some of Chairman Bernanke’s remarks on the interplay between term premiums, the shape of the yield curve, and the macroeconomy. ∗We are grateful for feedback from seminar participants at MIT, Stanford University, the University of Chicago, the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, th...|$|R
40|$|This paper quantifies how {{variation}} in economic activity and inflation in the United States influences the market prices of level, slope, and <b>curvature</b> <b>risks</b> in Treasury markets. We develop a novel arbitrage-free dynamic term structure {{model in which}} bond investment decisions are influenced by output and inflation risks that are un-spanned by (imperfectly correlated with) information about {{the shape of the}} yield curve. Our model reveals that, between 1985 and 2007, these risks accounted for {{a large portion of the}} {{variation in}} forward terms premiums, and there was pronounced cyclical variation in the market prices of level and slope risks. A POWERFUL IMPLICATION of virtually all macro-finance affine term structure models (MTSMs) —reduced-form and equilibrium alike—is that the macro fac-tors that determine bond prices are fully spanned by the current yield curve. 1 That is, the affine mapping between bond yields and the risks in the macroe-conomy in these models can be inverted to express these risk factors as lin-ear combinations of yields. This theoretical macro-spanning condition implies strong and often counterfactual restrictions on the joint distribution of bond yields and the macroeconomy, as well as on how macroeconomic shocks affect term premiums. Consider, for instance, an MTSM in which the macro variables Mt that di-rectly determine bond yields are output growth and inflation. Macro spanning implies that thesemacro variables can be replicated by portfolios of bond yields...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCollision {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} many car accidents occur when negotiating a bend. Excessive speed and steering wheel errors are often given {{by way of}} explanation. Nevertheless, the underlying origin of these dramatic errors could be, at least in part, a poor estimation of bend curvature. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate both the assessment of bend curvature by drivers and the impact of symbolic road signs that indicate a hazardous bend on this assessment. Thus, participants first viewed a video recording showing approaching bends of different curvature before being asked to assess the curvature of these bends. This assessment could either be a verbal (symbolic control) estimation of the bend's <b>curvature</b> and <b>risk,</b> or a sensorimotor (subsymbolic control) estimation of the bend's curvature (participants were asked to turn a steering wheel to mimic the position that would be necessary to accurately negotiate the bend). Results show that very severe bends (with a radius of less than 80 m) were actually underestimated. This was associated with an underestimation of risk corresponding to these bends and a poor sensorimotor anticipation of bend curvature. Road signs, which indicate risk significantly improve bend assessment, but this was of no use for sensorimotor anticipation. Thus, other indicators need to be envisaged in order to also improve this level of control...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{alternative}} {{options for}} monetary policy when the {{short-term interest rate}} is at the zero lower bound and develops new empirical estimates {{of the effects of}} the maturity structure of publicly held debt on the term structure of interest rates. We use a model of risk-averse arbitrageurs to develop measures of how the maturity structure of debt held by the public might a¤ect the pricing of level, slope and <b>curvature</b> term-structure <b>risk.</b> We find these Treasury factors historically were quite helpful for predicting both yields and excess returns over 1990 - 2007. The historical correlations are consistent with the claim that if in December of 2006, the Fed were to have sold off all its Treasury holdings of less than one-year maturity (about $ 400 billion) and use the proceeds to retire Treasury debt from the long end, this might have resulted in a 14 -basis-point drop in the 10 -year rate and an 11 -basis-point increase in the 6 -month rate. We also develop a description of how the dynamic behavior of the term structure of interest rates changed after hitting the zero lower bound in 2009. Our estimates imply that at the zero lower bound, such a maturity swap would have the same e¤ects as buying $ 400 billion in long-term maturities outright with newly created reserves, and could reduce the 10 -year rate by 13 basis points without raising short-term yields...|$|R
40|$|Consider a left-truncated right-censored {{survival}} process whose evolution {{depends on}} time-varying covariates. Given functional data {{samples from the}} process, we propose a gradient boosting procedure for estimating its log-intensity function in a flexible manner to capture time-covariate interactions. The estimator is shown to be consistent if the model is correctly specified. Alternatively an oracle inequality can be demonstrated for tree-based models. We use the procedure to shed new light on a question from the operations literature concerning the effect of workload on service rates in an emergency department. To avoid overfitting, boosting employs several regularization devices. One of them is step-size restriction, but the rationale for this is somewhat mysterious {{from the viewpoint of}} consistency: In theoretical treatments of classification and regression problems, unrestricted greedy step-sizes appear to suffice. Given that the partial log-likelihood functional for hazard regression has unbounded curvature, our study suggests that step-size restriction might be a mechanism for preventing the <b>curvature</b> of the <b>risk</b> from derailing convergence.

40|$|Efficient {{geometric}} {{design and}} signal timing not only improve operational performance at signalized intersections by expanding capacity and reducing traffic delays, but also {{result in an}} appreciable reduction in traffic conflicts, and thus better road safety. Information on the incidence of crashes, traffic flow, geometric design, road environment, and traffic control at 262 signalized intersections in Hong Kong during 2002 and 2003 are incorporated into a crash prediction model. Poisson regression and negative binomial regression are used to quantify the influence of possible contributory factors on the incidence of killed and severe injury (KSI) crashes and slight injury crashes, respectively, while possible interventions by traffic flow are controlled. The results for the incidence of slight injury crashes reveal that the road environment, degree of curvature, and presence of tram stops are significant factors, and that traffic volume has a diminishing effect on the crash risk. The presence of tram stops, number of pedestrian streams, road environment, proportion of commercial vehicles, average lane width, and degree of <b>curvature</b> increase the <b>risk</b> of KSI crashes, but the effect of traffic volume is negligible. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{decision}} support framework is proposed for assisting managers and executives to possibly utilise lean production control strategies to coordinate work authorisations and inventory management in supply chains. The framework allows decision makers {{to evaluate and}} compare the suitability of various strategies to their system especially when considering conflicting objectives, such as maximising customer service levels while minimising Work in Process (WIP) in a business environment distressed by variabilities and uncertainties in demand stemmed from customer power. Also, the framework provides decision guidance in selecting and testing optimal solutions of selected policies control parameters. The framework is demonstrated by application to a four-node serial supply-chain operating under three different pull-based supply chain strategies; namely CONWIP, Kanban, and Hybrid Kanban-CONWIP and exhibiting low, medium, and high variability in customer demand (i. e., coefficient of variation of 25 %, 112. 5 %, and 200 %). The framework consists of three phases; namely Modelling, Optimisation and Decision Support; and is applicable to both Simulation-Based and Metamodel-Based Optimisation. The Modelling phase includes conceptual modelling, discrete event simulation modelling and metamodels development. The Optimisation phase requires the application of multi-criteria optimisation methods to generate WIP-Service Level trade-off curves. The <b>Curvature</b> and <b>Risk</b> Analysis of the trade-off curves are utilised in the Decision Support phase to provide guidance to the decision maker in selecting and testing the best settings for the control parameters of the system. The inflection point of the curvature function indicates {{the point at which}} further increases in Service Level are only achievable by incurring an unacceptably higher cost in terms of average WIP. Risk analysis quantifies the risk associated with designing a supply chain system under specific environmental parameters. This research contributes an efficient framework that is applicable to solve real supply chain problems and better understanding of the potential impacts and expected effectiveness of different pull control mechanisms, and offers valuable insights on future research opportunities in this field to production and supply chain managers...|$|R
40|$|Stem {{sinuosity}} is {{a highly}} visible stem-form trait in the leaders of fast-growing Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. (Mirb.) Franco) trees, yet its cause is unknown. We tested the hypotheses that sinuous stems have longer expanses of primary growth than nonsinuous stems (putting the leader at higher <b>risk</b> <b>curvature,</b> induction of compression wood formation, and possibly overcorrection) and higher leader angle using 4 - to 5 -year-old saplings in raised beds. As hypothesized sinuous stems had longer expanses of primary growth than did nonsinuous stems (13. 5 vs. 12. 3 cm, respectively). However, for the dates for which growth (length/day, primary growth, secondary growth, and total growth) differed significantly among sinuosity class, sinuosity class only explained 15 %- 21 % {{of the variation in}} growth rate. There {{were no significant differences in}} leader angle for saplings of the three sinuosity classes. Contingency tables indicated some consistency in the category of sinuosity to which we assigned the stems in 2001 and 2002 (X² = 11. 2, p< 0. 004). When we used a more quantitative measure, the ratio of stem length/stem distance, there was a tendency toward a significant relationship between the two years (r= 0. 272, p= 0. 0893). These data suggest that, counter to expectation, the rate of stem growth was not a large factor in determining whether leaders become sinuous for this population of trees...|$|R
40|$|Background: Myopia is a {{refractive}} error that may caused by corneal curvature(CC) anomaly. The {{purpose of this}} study was to identify platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) gene and to find a correlation between sex, family history, near work, lighting, outdoor activity, CC, PDGFRA gene polymorhisms, and early-onset myopia in South Sumatera tribes. Method: Using a random sampling method, population-based, cross sectional study included 100 subjects aged 18 - 40 years from Palembang, South Sumatera, Indonesia. Visual acuity was measured by Snellen Chart and CC was measured by manual keratometer. DNA sample from buccal swab was investigated with Amplification Refractory Mutation System PCR and visualized in agarose gel. Result: Females were 4. 21 times more likely to have early-onset myopia than male. Subjects with parental, sibling, and paternal grandparent history of myopia were 6. 64, 3. 55 and 3. 58 times more likely to have early-onset myopia, respectively. Reading ≥ 6 times/week, reading > 2 hours/day and television viewing distance ≤ 60 cm were 2. 95, 2. 85 and 19. 13 times more likely to have early-onset myopia, respectively. Median of corneal curvature for right eye was 7. 73 (7. 07 - 8. 63) mm and left eye was 7. 73 (7. 04 - 8. 69) mm. There were no difference between CC in myopic and normal subjects. Distribution of mutant allele in rs 17084051, rs 7677751, rs 7682912, and rs 2114039 were bigger in myopic subject compare to normal subject. Significant p value for association between PDGFRA gene polymorphism and early-onset myopia was found only in rs 17084051 (p = 0. 009) and rs 7677751 (p = 0. 001). Conclusion: Mutant type allele A of rs 17084051 and mutant type allele T of rs 7677751 PDGFRA gene polymorphism, female sex, parental history of myopia, paternal grandparent history of myopia, sibling history of myopia, frequency of reading ≥ 6 times per week, duration of reading > 2 hours per day, and television viewing distance ≤ 60 cm are associated with early-onset myopia in South Sumatera tribes.

40|$|Material {{presented}} at a NASA-sponsored workshop on risk models for exposure conditions relevant to prolonged space flight {{are described in}} this paper. Analyses used mortality data from experiments conducted at Argonne National Laboratory on {{the long-term effects of}} external whole-body irradiation on B 6 CF 1 mice by 60 Co gamma rays and fission neutrons delivered as a single exposure or protracted over either 24 or 60 once-weekly exposures. The maximum dose considered was restricted to 1 Gy for neutrons and 10 Gy for gamma rays. Proportional hazard models were used to investigate the shape of the dose response at these lower doses for deaths caused by solid-tissue tumors and tumors of either connective or epithelial tissue origin. For protracted exposures, a significant mortality effect was detected at a neutron dose of 14 cGy and a gamma-ray dose of 3 Gy. For single exposures, radiation-induced mortality for neutrons also occurred within the range of 10 - 20 cGy, but dropped to 86 cGy for gamma rays. Plots of risk relative to control estimated for each observed dose gave a visual impression of nonlinearity for both neutrons and gamma rays. At least for solid-tissue tumors, male and female mortality was nearly identical for gamma-ray exposures, but mortality risks for females were higher than for males for neutron exposures. As expected, protracting the gamma-ray dose reduced mortality <b>risks.</b> Although <b>curvature</b> consistent with that observed visually could be detected by a model parameterized to detect <b>curvature,</b> a relative <b>risk</b> term containing only a simple term for total dose was usually sufficient to describe the dose response. Although detectable mortality for the three pathology end points considered typically occurred at the same level of dose, the highest risks were almost always associated with deaths caused by tumors of epithelial tissue origin...|$|R
40|$|Sports with a {{predominance}} of forward-bending and extension postures {{have been associated}} with alterations in the sagittal spinal <b>curvatures</b> and greater <b>risk</b> of spinal injury. Because, the tennis players adopt these postures, the aims of this study were: 1) to describe spinal curvatures and pelvic tilt in male and female highly trained adolescent tennis players during relaxed standing posture and with thoracic spine corrected (in prone lying on the floor); and 2) to determine the frequency of thoracic hyperkyphosis and lumbar hypo/hyper lordosis in these postures. Forty adolescent tennis players (24 male and 16 female) aged 13 - 18 years, participated voluntarily in this study. The Spinal Mouse system was used to measure sagittal spinal curvatures and pelvic tilt. The mean values in the relaxed standing posture were 43. 83 ° ± 7. 87 ° (thoracic kyphosis), - 27. 58 ° ± 7. 01 ° (lumbar lordosis), and 13. 38 ° ± 5. 57 ° (pelvic tilt) for male tennis players, respectively; and 36. 13 ° ± 6. 69 ° (thoracic kyphosis), - 32. 69 ° ± 5. 06 ° (lumbar lordosis), 20. 94 ° ± 5. 36 ° (pelvic tilt) for female tennis players (p < 0. 05 between genders in all spinal parameters). The male and female tennis players showed a frequency of 62. 5 % and 93. 8 % (p = 0. 032) for neutral thoracic kyphosis, and 83. 3 % and 93. 8 % (p = 0. 062) in neutral lumbar lordosis, respectively. In conclusion, due to the high percentage of neutral spinal curvatures in both male and female tennis players, to practice tennis in these levels does not alter sagittal spinal morphology in the relaxed standing posture in adolescent highly trained tennis player...|$|R
