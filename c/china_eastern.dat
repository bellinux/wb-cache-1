5|$|Typhoon Ewiniar {{killed at}} least 34people in China, with areas as far {{northwest}} as Gansu and Shanxi affected by landslides. It is not known if the landslides were triggered directly {{as a result of}} Ewiniar, or whether it was caused by a combination of Ewiniar and other weather. Therefore, the deaths that can be attributed to Ewiniar from the landslides are assumed to be indirectly caused, and not directly. Average rainfall reported in Shandong was 3.4mm (0.133inches) per hour from 6a.m. July 9 through midnight July 10 (totalling about 61.2mm or 2.4inches). At least 300 flights out of Beijing's Capital International Airport had to be delayed due to thunderstorms and effects of Ewiniar, while Air China and <b>China</b> <b>Eastern</b> Airlines cancelled flights to South Korea heading out of China.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the trend of}} variation in development performance within <b>China's</b> <b>Eastern</b> Zone and the underlying mechanism of the changing trend. Empirical descriptions as well as analyses are provided based on the comparison between data on development performance of regions and provinces and records of policy transformation from 1949 {{to the end of}} 20 th century. Furthermore, a comparative case study on two of China's leading provinces in the Eastern Zone, Guangdong and Shanghai, is conducted in order to reveal how the interplay of differences in geographical conditions and policy makes contributions to their development disparities in Maoist development period and post-Mao development period. This study finds that development as well as policy advantages are not unevenly shared in China or in <b>China's</b> <b>Eastern</b> Zone. Furthermore, the study reveals that a two-way interaction between policy and certain aspects of geographical conditions exists and it gives rise to development disparities in <b>China's</b> <b>Eastern</b> Zone. According to detailed analysis, there are two main channels through which the interaction functions. On the one hand, geographical conditions act as an important shaping force underlying policy formulation and then a specific set of policy is issued to assist development of a specific province based on the influence of its geographical conditions. On the other hand, the influence of geographical conditions comes to shape development performance directly even at the time when a similar set of policy is carried out by provinces. Thesi...|$|R
