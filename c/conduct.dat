5|$|Although ionic {{compounds}} contain charged atoms or clusters, {{these materials}} do not typically <b>conduct</b> electricity to any significant extent when the substance is solid. In order to <b>conduct,</b> the charged particles must be mobile rather than stationary in a crystal lattice. This is achieved {{to some degree}} at high temperatures when the defect concentration increases the ionic mobility and solid state ionic conductivity is observed. When the ionic compounds are dissolved in a liquid or are melted into a liquid, they can <b>conduct</b> electricity because the ions become completely mobile. This conductivity gain upon dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of ionic compounds.|$|E
