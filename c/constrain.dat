40|$|In a <b>constrained</b> {{pseudorandom}} function (PRF), {{the holder}} {{of the master}} secret key can derive <b>constrained</b> keys {{with respect to a}} boolean circuit C. The <b>constrained</b> key can be used to evaluate the PRF on all inputs x for which C(x) = 1. In almost all existing constructions of <b>constrained</b> PRFs, the <b>constrained</b> key itself reveals its constraints. We introduce the concept of private <b>constrained</b> PRFs, which are <b>constrained</b> PRFs with the additional property that the <b>constrained</b> keys do not reveal their constraints. Our main notion of privacy captures the intuition that an adversary, given a <b>constrained</b> key for one of two circuits C 0 and C 1, is unable to tell which circuit is associated with its key. As a primitive, private <b>constrained</b> PRFs have many natural applications in searchable symmetric encryption, deniable encryption, and more. We then show how to instantiate private <b>constrained</b> PRFs. Our first construction uses indistinguishability obfuscation and achieves our strongest notions of functionality and privacy. We also give two constructions based on concrete assumptions on multilinear maps which achieve slightly weaker notions of privacy and for more limited classes of constraints: namely, for the class of bit-fixing constraints and puncturing constraints. ...|$|R
