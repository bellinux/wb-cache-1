50|$|Khali {{made his}} return at the 2011 Royal Rumble, but was {{eliminated}} shortly by Mason Ryan. On the 14 March episode of Raw, after Khali defeated The Miz by disqualification, Miz assaulted Khali with a steel chair, injuring him. Khali won an interbrand dark match battle royal at WrestleMania XXVII on 3 April. On 26 April, Khali was drafted back to SmackDown {{as part of}} the 2011 supplemental draft. Khali returned on the 29 April episode of SmackDown, talking backstage with Jinder Mahal, who made his WWE debut that night. On the 2 May episode of Raw, Khali dressed up as the Tooth Fairy at The Rock's birthday party. On the 6 May episode of SmackDown, Mahal—unimpressed by how Khali and Ranjin Singh have been partaking in childish activities instead of winning matches—confronted Singh about his mismanagement of Khali. Mahal then interrupted a Khali Kiss <b>Cam</b> <b>segment</b> the following week on SmackDown, slapping Khali twice. On the 20 May episode of SmackDown, Mahal interrupted Khali's match against Jey Uso, which led to Khali leaving the ring to confront Mahal, who then slapped Khali again, which made Khali re-enter the ring, defeat Jey Uso and then assault Jimmy Uso after the match.|$|E
50|$|Dhesi {{made his}} {{televised}} WWE debut on the April 29, 2011 episode of SmackDown under the ring name Jinder Mahal, greeting backstage fellow Indian wrestler The Great Khali and his manager Ranjin Singh by speaking in Punjabi {{that he was}} really happy and excited to see Khali and Ranjin. The next week on SmackDown, Mahal, unimpressed by how Khali and Singh have been partaking in childish activities instead of winning matches, confronted Singh about his mismanagement of Khali, establishing himself as a villain. Mahal interrupted a Khali Kiss <b>Cam</b> <b>segment</b> the following week on SmackDown, slapping Khali twice. On the May 20 episode of SmackDown, Mahal interrupted Khali's match against Jey Uso, leading to Khali confronting Mahal. On his first televised match on the June 17 episode of SmackDown, Mahal defeated Vladimir Kozlov and on the July 1 episode of SmackDown it was revealed that Mahal was married to Khali's sister, making them (kayfabe) brothers-in-law. On the September 5 episode of Raw, he suffered his first loss when he and Khali lost to WWE Tag Team Champions Evan Bourne and Kofi Kingston in a non-title match. In a rematch on SmackDown, they lost again to Bourne and Kingston, leadig Khali to walk away from Mahal after the match, thus ending their alliance. On the September 16 episode of SmackDown, Mahal attacked Khali during his match with Heath Slater which Khali won by disqualification. On the September 23 episode of SmackDown, Mahal lost to Khali, thus suffering his first loss in a singles match. On the October 14 episode of SmackDown, Mahal competed in a 41-man battle royal (the largest battle royal in WWE history), where Mahal made it to the final three before being eliminated by Randy Orton.|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas putida PpGl, {{which carries}} the CAM plasmid {{encoding}} enzymes {{involved in the}} degradation pathway of D-camphor, can utilize D-camphor as a sole carbon source. Cytochrome P- 450 cam and related enzymes participate in the early oxidation steps of D-camphor degradation metabolism. We cloned from a Hindlll DNA library of PpGl a 2. 9 kbp <b>CAM</b> <b>segment</b> which carries the major part of camA gene encoding NADH-putidaredoxin reductase and the entire camB gene encoding putidaredoxin. The 2. 9 kbp <b>CAM</b> <b>segment</b> was adjacent to the 4. 27 kbp Hindlll <b>CAM</b> <b>segment</b> which has been previous-ly cloned (Koga et al. (1986) J. BacterioL 166, 1089 - 1095). Thus, the total 7. 17 kbp Hindlll CAM directed all the genes responsible for early steps of D-camphor degradation, Le. 5 -exo-hydroxycamphor dehydrogenase (camD gene), cytochrome P- 450 cam (camC), NADH-putidaredoxin reductase (camA), and putidaredoxin (camB). These cam genes form an operon, camDCAB, and are under negative control by the gene camR located immediate-ly upstream from the camD gene. The total number of amino acids deduced from the nucleotide sequence is 422 for putidaredoxin reductase, and 106 for putidaredoxin. Pseudomonas putida strain PpGl, ATCC 17453, was iso...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{transcriptional}} {{activity of}} human estrogen receptor ERα is modulated {{by a number}} of coregulatory proteins among which calmodulin (<b>CaM).</b> <b>Segment</b> 295 - 311 in the hinge region of ERα has previously been proposed to be the CaM binding site. In this work, we investigate the molecular mechanism of the interaction of CaM with peptides derived from the hinge region of ERα, using a biophysical approach combining isothermal titration calorimetry, fluorescence, CD and NMR. The ERα 17 p peptide, corresponding to the previously identified 295 - 311 region of ERα, recruits mainly the C-terminal domain of Ca(4) CaM, as shown by NMR spectroscopy. In contrast, a longer peptide, ERα 25 p, extended on the N-terminal side (residues 287 - 311) interacts with both N- and C-terminal domains of Ca(4) CaM. These results lead to a new delineation of the CaM binding site, encompassing residues 287 - 294. In particular, fluorescence spectroscopy reveals that the conserved W(292) residue is engaged within hydrophobic pockets on Ca(4) CaM. ITC results show that ERα 25 p binds Ca(4) CaM with an atypical 2 : 1 stoichiometry and a dissociation constant in the micromolar range. Based on the NMR titration of Ca(4) CaM by ERα 25 p showing a biphasic behavior for several residues, we suggest that concerted conformational changes of CaM domains may be required to accommodate the binding of a second peptide. CD spectra indicate that ERα 25 p partially folds into an α-helix upon binding to Ca(4) CaM. Hence, ERα 25 p is a new CaM-binding ligand that could be appropriate for the synthesis of derivatives able to control ER-dependent transcription, particularly in the context of hormone-dependent breast tumors...|$|E

5000|$|An {{alternate}} design, the Rand cam engine, {{replaces the}} plate {{with one or more}} sinousoidal cam surfaces. Vanes mounted parallel to a shaft mounted inside a cylindrical 'barrel' that are free to sliding up and down ride the sinuous <b>cam,</b> the <b>segments</b> formed by rotor, stator walls and vanes constituting combustion chambers. In effect these spaces serving the same purpose as the cylinders of an axial engine, and the sinuous cam surface acts as the face of the pistons. In other respect this form follows the normal cycles of internal combustion but with burning gas directly imparting a force on the cam surface, translated into a rotational force by timing one or more detonations. This design eliminates the multiple reciprocal pistons, ball joints and swash plate of a conventional 'barrel' engine but crucially depends on effective sealing provided by sliding and rotating surfaces.http://www.regtech.com/radmax_technology/ ...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-order}} polynomial {{gas distribution}} cam mechanism is investigated theoretically {{from the viewpoint}} of thermal elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL). First, a cam with a larger base circle radius is employed, which results in slide–roll ratio 2. 0 [*]<[*]S[*]<[*] 9. 0 when the two surfaces move oppositely. The pressure, film thickness, and temperature profiles at a number of angular positions of the cam are presented, together with the isothermal results. The comparison between thermal and isothermal oil characteristics is also shown. It is revealed that the isothermal analysis partly overestimates the actual film thickness and it also misses some essential local phenomena. Second, a cam with a smaller base circle radius is studied, which leads to drastic variations in the slide–roll ratio which encounters four times’ occurrences of infinity in one working period. The pressure, film thickness, and temperature profiles at some angular cam positions together with the oil characteristics are given, showing much dramatic variations. A very small film thickness is observed at the contact of the tappet with the start of the <b>cam</b> basic <b>segment,</b> which suggests a possible risk of direct contact of both surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{method for}} {{reduction}} of valve timing movable masses, {{by the use}} of composite cams for camshaft, which mate with roller tappet, is presented. It has been carried out an analysis of stresses under the surface of the cam using the methodology and computer programs allowing the synthesis and analysis of the cam mechanism, and to estimate the fatigue life, as well as using the finite element method. Mating roller tappets with a light camshaft, forged from TiAl alloy, can be done if the camshaft has steel caps set under the pressure on the surfaces their cams. The problem, however, is the formation of high stress in the Bielaiev point, when a roller tappet mates with <b>segment</b> <b>cam.</b> Because of the certainty for the cap fixing, it is assumed that the depth for the Bielaiev point should not exceed half the thickness of the cap. The stress analysis shows, that exceeding of the material yield strength is controlled by the interference value between the cam and its cap and by the apex radius of the cam. Effect of contact stress is at least an order of magnitude smaller. The maximum depth of the Bielaiev point does not exceed 0. 09 mm, which is about half the thickness of the proposed cap. There is a need not for too small radii between the cam and the apical cap. Optimal selection of proper geometry of the cam will be easier after a proper modification of the program used for the synthesis and analysis of the cam mechanism, such {{that it is possible to}} ask any operational surface of the cam profile...|$|R
