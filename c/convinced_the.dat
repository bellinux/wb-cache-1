5|$|Andrei {{was played}} by Gabriel Huian (untrained actor, {{previously}} appearing {{in a video}} clip that caught the director's attention). He was Cristian Nemescu's preferred choice from the beginning, however a rigorous casting still took place. Apparently attracted to Mădălina Ghiţescu, Huian showed a different attitude than that of other candidates, which only <b>convinced</b> <b>the</b> director further.|$|E
5|$|Ark Royal {{returned}} to base in Loch Ewe, {{where she and}} her crew were inspected by Winston Churchill. The sinking of U-39 was hailed as important to morale.

5|$|<b>Convinced</b> <b>the</b> {{book would}} be popular, Jewett made the unusual {{decision}} (for the time) to have six full-page illustrations by Hammatt Billings engraved {{for the first}} printing.

A number of other editions were soon printed (including a deluxe edition in 1853, featuring 117 illustrations by Billings).|$|E
5|$|Geffen's press {{promotion}} for Nevermind {{was lower}} than that typical of a major record label.

5|$|Parker's {{proposal}} {{was for a}} 7-bay fire station on a site {{more than double the}} size of the one proposed on Newton Street.

5|$|Roth <b>convinced</b> <b>the</b> local {{inhabitants}} {{of the importance of}} the restoration works, which required a large labor force: typically 40 to 80workers in towns with populations of 500 to 2,000 were required for church restoration. The effort indicates the strength of and commitment to the unique shared heritage present in the towns. This restoration has resulted in a revival of local traditions and a qualified workforce.|$|E
5|$|Seltzer {{defended the}} Cleveland Press {{and his own}} {{personal}} involvement in the case in his 1956 memoir The Years Were Good. Seltzer argued that he was <b>convinced</b> <b>the</b> Sheppard family {{was involved in a}} conspiracy to get away with murder and that he personally wrote the editorials, instead of passing them off to one of his employees, out of concern for the safety of his staff.|$|E
5|$|The British {{released}} Brand on 5 October 1944. Brand {{said they}} would not allow him to return to Hungary and forced him to travel to Palestine. Bauer disputes this, writing that Brand was simply afraid of returning to Budapest, <b>convinced</b> <b>the</b> Germans would murder him.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} {{to found a}} national organization was likely the result of several factors. First, the mainstream trade unions were increasingly reformist and centralized.

Third, loss of membership (for example, the Berlin metal workers rejoined the DMV in 1897) <b>convinced</b> <b>the</b> localists {{of the need for}} action.|$|E
5|$|The {{scattered}} {{nature of}} the airborne landings caused some confusion among the German high command. At the LXII Corps headquarters, several reports of the landings exaggerated their strength, causing the Germans to believe they were faced with a far greater force. Also, 600 dummy paratroops that had landed {{to the north and}} west of Toulon, as part of the Allied deception plan, <b>convinced</b> <b>the</b> Germans another landing had taken place there.|$|E
