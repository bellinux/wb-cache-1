40|$|A Personal Learning Environment (PLE) can be {{understood}} as an individual’s perception of the resources and activities in relation to a particular learning project.

40|$|During much of {{the twentieth}} century, civil {{processes}} in the United States relied on a conceptual framework anchored in the constitutional and common law of due process. More recently, the case law looks to doctrines of contract and agency law to enforce contracts to preclude litigation and to encourage the entry of contracts to conclude litigation. While “bargaining {{in the shadow of}} the law” is a phrase often invoked, bargaining is increasingly a requirement of the law of conflict resolution, both civil and criminal. Therefore, analyses of the meaning of agreements, familiar features of the law of contract, are becoming central elements of the new law of Civil Procedure. As a consequence, debate needs to center on what the law of “Contract Procedure” should provide. Central questions include whether parties ought to be able to contract for jurisdiction (both state and federal), for choice-of-law rules, and for privacy. <b>Contract</b> <b>Procedure</b> needs also to decide how to regulate the role of judges (who sometimes participate in shaping civil bargains) and what rights parties have when post-agreement conflicts arise either about the existence of a settlement or about the meaning of its terms. As <b>Contract</b> <b>Procedure</b> supplements and sometimes supplants “Due Process Procedure,” the rules of bargaining for legally binding judgments need to identify what bargains law cannot abide.

40|$|Judicial {{decisions}} of public courts increasingly {{are based on}} “contract procedure,” private rules of procedure that the parties draft and assent to before a dispute even has arisen. These rules govern such matters as the forum in which the proceeding will be conducted, whether a jury {{will be involved in}} adjudicating the dispute, the scope of rights of discovery, and rules of evidence. The practice deserves greater attention and should raise more profound concerns than the academic literature currently suggests. We argue that <b>contract</b> <b>procedure</b> operates as a form of privatization that effectively outsources government functions to private contracting parties. As such, <b>contract</b> <b>procedure</b> has the potential to promote self-governance, encourage innovation, and secure efficiency. Yet it also permits unelected and unaccountable contract drafters to reshape adjudication, procedural rulemaking, and substantive law with virtually no meaningful oversight by Congress, agencies, or the courts. The practice of <b>contract</b> <b>procedure</b> has effects that spill over from the private world of the contracting parties into a world in which more public modes of deliberation and decision making have traditionally prevailed. Our argument that these spillovers may be negative draws from well-developed theoretical concerns about the potential inefficiency of the private production of public goods, the potential threats to political competition posed by allowing economic actors to influence the exercise of adjudicative power, the dangers of exit from public institutions highlighted by Albert Hirschman’s theory of exit, voice and loyalty, and Michael Walzer’s account of the appropriate boundaries of the different “spheres of justice. ” We suggest a package of reforms that are aimed at the system effects that we identify and that are designed to capture the benefits of privatization while ensuring the transparency, public-regarding values, and information production that are essential to sound judicial administration. The two central reforms can be easily administered and would encourage greater oversight by Congress, agencies, and the courts. The two reforms are: (1) a requirement that the civil cover sheet that typically accompanies the filing of a complaint in a public court inquire whether the parties have agreed to deviate from any public rules of procedure and (2) a requirement that any such deviation be a mandatory topic of discussion at a judicial pre-trial conference and that the court consider and assess the likely effect of the customized rule in terms of party fairness, judicial integrity, and administrative efficiency...|$|E

The problem is that these social rules impose costs. They prohibit us from doing some things we might see as important and they require us {{to do other things}} that we might otherwise not do. The question for the contractarian is whether the costs of these social rules can be rationally justified. I argue that traditional contract theories have tended to underestimate the importance of evaluating the cost of enforcement and compliance in the <b>contract</b> <b>procedure.</b> In addition, the social contract has been understood narrowly as a method of justifying specifically moral or political rules. I defend a broader version of contractarianism as a justificatory model {{that can be used to}} evaluate any set of social rules or institutions that impose costs on agents. In so doing, I argue that contractarianism is a general method of evaluating and justifying the rules that order the structure of social life...|$|E

40|$|Abstract__ Privatization {{of urban}} {{services}} focuses {{often on the}} involvement of foreign enterprises. This contribution deals with micro-privatization, the partial transfer of government responsibility for solid waste collection to micro-enterprises. It tries {{to shed light on}} whether the current private sector participation (PSP) of micro-enterprises in solid waste collection service {{is the best way to}} capture the expected advantages of private sector involvement. The article examines the relations of the micro-enterprises with beneficiaries and the public sector by focusing on the <b>contract</b> <b>procedure,</b> the tariff-setting process, the cost recovery mechanism and institutionalizing of market principles for micro-enterprises. The research was carried out using secondary and primary data sources. Primary data were collected through the interviewing of public sector officials at different levels, focus group discussions with community groups and micro-enterprises, and observation. A survey was conducted among 160 micro-enterprises in the city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, using a standard questionnaire. What are some of the factors contributing to the results of PSP in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia? Policies at higher levels of government definitely produced an overall climate conducive to micro-privatization and recognized the need to develop micro-enterprises, but it is not clear what role the micro-enterprises are to play in solid waste management. New opportunities were created by formalization and taken up by communities and micro-enterprises. Coverage and waste collected both increased. The initiation and institutionalization of the formalization process was not without problems. The public sector over-stressed the autonomy of micro-enterprises. The fate of the micro-enterprises is largely determined by the reforms undertaken at local government level. The rapid changes in policies at the local level made waste-collecting micro-enterprises lose confidence and more dependent on the public sector. The study shows the continued power of the state and its agents in shaping developments in this domain...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} {{this study has}} asked is, How does the psalmist craft the images of his enemies {{in the terms of}} law? In the process of answering, I address three major theses. The first thesis revolves around the observation that the lamenting psalmist tends to follow up his descriptions of the enemies’ wrongs with specific punishments. As this study argues, the psalmist’s muse for that wrong/punishment exchange is his own legal culture. The second thesis is that the psalmist’s calls for violent punishments of his enemies reflect legal norms in his external reality. This is proposed in direct response to the persistent scholarly assumption that the punishments invoked in these psalms are internally born of the psalmists’ fantasies, as well as being confined to that realm. I argue that the psalmist not only draws on legal-cultural punishment norms but in fact depends on their normative status in order to convey to his readers the nature of his enemies’ crimes. The third thesis is that the external reality in question is the ancient Near Eastern legal milieu of which biblical law is a part. Chapter Three shows how the psalmist’s use of talionic language with reference to his enemies happens only when their behaviour is consistent with crimes punished in the “like for like” pattern elsewhere throughout ancient Near Eastern legal history. Chapter Four demonstrates that the psalmist’s description of his enemies as slanderers and as “those who reproach” is framed in a legal-cultural understanding of shame as a sanctioned — and necessary — form of punishment for these crimes. After establishing the primacy of orality in <b>contract</b> <b>procedure,</b> Chapter Five shows how the psalmist’s mouth-focussed punishments assume the nature of contract-making and breaking in ancient Near Eastern law. Underlying these three theses is a theoretical critique of approaches to law in the psalms thus far, which have consistently assumed a definition of law that coheres with a contemporary Western understanding of law but diverges from that of the psalmist. I propose (in Chapter Two) that a definition of law guided by functional criteria, technical meaning, and the observation of norms, is the most fitting for an encounter with the psalmist’s own legal understanding. Taking this approach then allows this study to present the lamenting psalmist as a participant in a legal culture that extends far beyond the confines of the Pentateuch...|$|E

Ker gre za porabo javnih sredstev, mora biti celoten postopek pravno urejen. Namen diplomskega dela je na splošno predstaviti področje javnega naročanja v Republiki Sloveniji ter na drugi strani bolj podrobno predstaviti javno naročanje na področju občin. Cilj dela je ugotoviti, ali med naročniki (občinami) in izbranimi ponudniki v postopkih javnega naročanja obstaja teritorialna povezava. Teritorialno povezavo opredeljujem kot povezavo med naročnikom in izbranim ponudnikom, ki ima svoj sedež na območju naročnika (občine). Na podlagi pridobljenih rezultatov ugotavljam, da v analiziranih primerih ni prisotne teritorialne povezave med naročniki in izbranimi ponudniki v tem smislu, da bi se v postopkih oddaje javnih naročil preferiralo domače ponudnike. Izkazalo se je ravno obratno, večina izbranih ponudnikov se je namreč nahajala izven območja občine, ki je v postopku nastopala kot naročnik. Te ugotovitve pa, glede na omejitve raziskave, v kateri se je analiziralo javna naročila le štirih občin, ne moremo posplošiti na vse občine v Republiki Sloveniji. Public {{procurement}} is {{a procedure}} {{in which the}} public sector purchases goods, services and construction performance {{from the private sector}} by means of public resources.

The aim of my thesis is to present the area of public procurement in the Republic of Slovenia in general on one hand and to present public procurement in the area of municipalities in more detail on the other hand. The objective of my thesis is to find out whether there is a territorial connection in the proceedings of public procurement between the clients (municipalities) and the selected tenderer. Territorial connection is defined as a connection between a client and a selected tenderer who has its headquarters {{in the area of the}} client (municipality). Based on the extracted results, I establish that there is no territorial connection present between the clients and the selected tenderer in the analysed examples in the sense that in the award of public <b>contract</b> <b>procedure</b> domestic tenderers are not favoured. In fact, the opposite has proven to be the case as the majority of the selected tenderers are located outside the area of the municipality which performed as the client. These findings, however, cannot be generalized to all municipalities in the Republic of Slovenia due to the limitations of the research study where only public procurements of four municipalities were analysed...|$|E
