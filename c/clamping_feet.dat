6000|$|The {{windows of}} the dining-room were opened to let in the fresh air, and afforded to the passers-by in the street a pleasant, or perhaps, tantalising view of six gentlemen in white {{waistcoats}} with a quantity of decanters {{and a variety of}} fruits before them--little boys, as they passed and jumped up at the area-railings and took a peep, said to one another, [...] "Hi hi, Jim, shouldn't you like to be there and have a cut of that there pineapple?"--the horses and carriages of the nobility and gentry passed by conveying them to Belgravian toilets: the policeman, with <b>clamping</b> <b>feet</b> patrolled up and down before the mansion: the shades of evening began to fall: the gasman came and lighted the lamps before Sir Francis's door: the butler entered the dining-room, and illuminated the antique gothic chandelier over the antique carved oak dining-table: so that from outside the house you looked inwards upon a night-scene of feasting and wax-candles; and from within you beheld a vision of a calm summer evening, and the wall of Saint James's Park, and the sky above, in which a star or two was just beginning to twinkle.|$|E

50|$|After further {{interrogation}} Rani immobilises Sarah Jane's, Luke's, Clyde's and Rani's feet {{using the}} gifts {{he had given}} them and reveals {{himself to be a}} Slitheen after all, unzipping his forehead to reveal a diminutive Raxacoricofallapatorian and stating his plan to steal K-9 and the information it contains. Thinking swiftly, Sarah Jane manages to use her sonic lipstick to release their <b>feet</b> <b>clamps</b> and <b>clamp</b> Rani's <b>feet.</b> Clyde then throws Rani's bowler hat at a switch on Mr Smith, teleporting Rani away and releasing the clamp on K-9.|$|R
40|$|The Micro Walker project,which is {{reported}} in this thesis, focuses {{on the development of}} linear micro-motors with a large dynamic range (reach : resolution). The key question for this project is if it is possible to implement walking motion in MEMS, and what can be the performance of linear micromotors employing walking motion. From their potential application in data storage guiding specifications are derived: An output acceleration of a mg load larger than 100 m / s 2, 10 nm resolution, reach larger than 10 mm, a driving voltage below 30 V and a maximum linear size smaller than 1 mm. The linear micromotors to made in the project, are based on variable capacitance electrostatic actuation and surface micromachining fabrication technology. Electrostatic motors have already been made in the 18 th century. The first known variable capacitance motor has been built by Zipernowski in 1889. Different propulsion principles for linear micromotors have been found in literature: Inertial drive, elastic inertial drive, impact drive, traveling field surface drive, scratch drive, zigzag drive, transformation of rotary into linearly motion, and walking motion. The latter principle is implemented in the project. Controlled friction in <b>clamp</b> <b>feet</b> is necessary for walking. Therefore, microtribology {{is one of the main}} topics in this thesis. The focus is on shearing friction in elastic adhesive contacts...|$|R
50|$|The {{trick is}} {{performed}} {{by removing the}} shoe furthest from the audience, and turning that foot 90 degrees away from the audience, with the empty shoe <b>clamped</b> between both <b>feet.</b> When the performer stands {{on the tip of}} the hidden foot, the two shoes are raised together, and the audience assumes that these are both of the performer's feet.|$|R
40|$|The {{stunning}} of ostriches (Struthio camelus) {{has traditionally}} been carried out with hand-held tongs whilst birds are held in a restraining area by applying pressure normally from behind by gently pushing on the tail feathers. The area is often a V-shaped structure, high enough that the stunning operator is not kicked. After stunning, the birds are rocked backwards and a rubberised leg clamp placed over the legs at the tarso-metatarsal bone allowing the birds to be chain-shackled by the big toes. This stunning procedure {{has been replaced by}} a new restraining and stunning mechanism which completely envelops the ostrich in a padded clamp holder. Double-padded sides restrain the bird's upper thighs and a rubberised <b>foot</b> <b>clamp</b> holds the <b>feet</b> so there is no physical damage to the bird. As the bird is electrically stunned with electrodes placed both sides of the head, the entire stunning box rotates 180 ° so that toe clamps can be applied without any danger to the stunning operators. Within 20 s of stunning, the birds are bled by means of a complete ventral cut to the neck and/or by thoracic sticking. © 2012 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare...|$|R
50|$|A HangBoard bolts to a {{standard}} snowboard in place of bindings, and the pilot — wearing a harness — hangs from a T-shaped bar. Arms push against handlebars in the front, and <b>feet</b> <b>clamp</b> into rudders at the back. Most control occurs by weight shifting, but pilots can also achieve directional control by using the foot rudders. Applied simultaneously, the rudders function as brakes. The HangBoard frame is made of aircraft aluminum, weighs less than 11 kg without the snowboard, and measures 160 cm long, 32 cm high when folded up, and 47 cm wide.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the design {{compliance}} matrix (DCM) {{is to provide a}} single-source document of all design requirements associated with the fifteen subsystems that make up the rotary mode core sampling (RMCS) system. It is intended to be the baseline requirement document for the RMCS system and to be used in governing all future design and design verification activities associated with it. This document is the DCM for the RMCS system used on Hanford single-shell radioactive waste storage tanks. This includes the Exhauster System, Rotary Mode Core Sample Trucks, Universal Sampling System, Diesel Generator System, Distribution Trailer, X-Ray Cart System, Breathing Air Compressor, Nitrogen Supply Trailer, Casks and Cask Truck, Service Trailer, Core Sampling Riser Equipment, Core Sampling Support Trucks, <b>Foot</b> <b>Clamp,</b> Ramps and Platforms and Purged Camera System. Excluded items are tools such as light plants and light stands. Other items such as the breather inlet filter are covered by a different design baseline. In this case, the inlet breather filter is covered by the Tank Farms Design Compliance Matrix...|$|R
5000|$|Almost {{all modern}} front-entry boots consist of two sections, one around the foot, and another around the lower leg. These {{are joined by}} rivets/rotating joints near the ankle that allows the leg to pivot forward, {{but not to the}} sides. This allows {{excellent}} control by transmitting even the smallest lateral movements of the leg to the ski. However, the rigid cuff also makes them very difficult to put on and take off. Additionally, because the boot <b>clamps</b> across the <b>foot,</b> pulling the sides inward, it is difficult to produce a single design that fits a range of foot shapes and sizes. This leads to shell modification services, when the boot is stretched to fit the skier's foot, typically by heating the plastic and pressing it into place. This is also known as [...] "blowing" [...] ("punching", [...] "pushing"). Sometimes material will be ground off the boot to provide more room. This is normally used only with front-entry designs, other designs normally include much more room in the foot area as they do not clamp down the same way.|$|R
50|$|WWNO’s chief engineer, Robert Carroll, {{with both}} of his children, one who has special needs, drove behind police lines {{to get to his}} home for {{medicine}} and to see the station’s transmitter site in Gretna. He immediately noticed that 200 feet of transmission line {{up the side of the}} tower was missing. Katrina’s winds burst the <b>clamps</b> (every 8 <b>feet).</b> The line hit the ground with such force it left a mark in the concrete. That had to be repaired and was done so in-kind by the tower’s owner. Upon its arrival, Carroll and operations manager Ron Curtis set up and aimed the downlink at the GPB satellite, and set up a Musicam Internet Codec at the site to serve as a return audio feed and a backup for the satellite. Public Interactive loaned WWNO a second for the end in Atlanta. The station kept its connection to the Crescent City via Program Director Fred Kasten, who built a studio in his home in New Orleans after returning from the evacuation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that perfluorochemical (PFC) liquid ventilation (LV) can be used as a vehicle to deliver halothane and induce and maintain analgesia. Seven hamsters were paralysed and stabilized with mechanical gas ventilation, ventilated in alternating cycles with gas and either neat oxygenated PFC liquid or oxygenated PFC liquid mixed with liquid halothane (PFC:hal) 1 · 50 % (volume/vapour); arterial pressure and blood gases were monitored throughout the protocol. After each cycle, the animal was stimulated with a <b>foot</b> <b>clamp</b> for 2 s. Mean arterial pressure (MAP:mmHg) response to this stimulation (percent change from the resting MAP) was used as an index of analgesia. Mean arterial pressure was significantly lower during ventilation with PFC:hal (73 ± 7 se) as compared with MAP during neat PFC (113 ± 5 se) or gas ventilation (107 ± se). Mean arterial pressure response (% change in MAP from baseline) to foot-clamp stimulation was significantly lower with PFC:hal ventilation (+ 12 ± 5 % se) as compared with neat PFC (+ 28 ± 8 % se) and gas ventilation (+ 29 ± 9 % se). There was no statistically significant difference in resting MAP or MAP response to foot-clamp stimulation between cycles of ventilation with neat PFC alone or gas ventilation; arterial blood gases were not significantly different between modes of ventilation or levels of analgesia. The data indicate that halothane can be administered during LV while supporting gas exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility of inducing analgesia while using PFC LV techniques...|$|R
