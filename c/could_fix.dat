5|$|The Wii U version {{released}} on March 30, 2013. The beta test began on March 5. A port for Microsoft Windows was {{released on}} September 26. Ports to both the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and Nintendo Switch were announced as being in development in August 2016. These ports will both be released in 2017; the PS4 version will release on August 17, and the Switch version on September 21, 2017. With {{the announcement of the}} Switch version, Square Enix offered players the option of switching their characters and progress to the Switch version. In addition to the standard home console releases, versions for potable and mobile platforms have been released that rely on cloud streaming, needing an internet connection to function. A version for Android and iOS was co-developed by Square Enix with NTT DoCoMo and Ubitus: NTT DoCoMo's dGame service was used as the release platform, while Ubitus' cloud technology was used for the streaming. It released on December 16, 2013. A second version was developed for the 3DS, using a similar streaming function to the mobile versions. This version released on September 4, 2014. On release, the 3DS version suffered from multiple technical problems, including issues with logging in, frequent maintenance periods, disconnection issues, poor sound quality, and the game's native text font being too small for the 3DS screen. The negative feedback caused Square Enix to temporarily stop shipments so they <b>could</b> <b>fix</b> the issues.|$|E
25|$|The basic calculating {{system was}} so adapted that could he but obtain regular and {{reliable}} data, he <b>could</b> <b>fix</b> the currency relationships among many more countries. Mee believed, however, that even his incomplete data had great utility. The currency relationships permitted him {{to determine the}} purchasing power of the Stelo and to express it in the national currency of a certain country. To {{be able to put}} the Stelo into service everywhere would require the joint work of a multinational network of collaborators. Yet Lawrence Mee continued.|$|E
25|$|The {{last major}} {{components}} {{to be put}} into place were the sixteen semi-circular ribs of the vaulted transept, which were also the only major structural parts that were made of wood. These were raised into position as eight pairs, and all were fixed into place within a week. Thanks to the simplicity of Paxton's design and the combined efficiency of the building contractor and their suppliers, the entire structure was assembled with extraordinary speed—the team of 80 glaziers <b>could</b> <b>fix</b> more than 18,000 panes of sheet glass in a week—and the building was complete and ready to receive exhibits in just five months.|$|E

25|$|After they <b>could</b> <b>fix</b> some rope on firm {{rocks and}} secure {{themselves}} {{they were able}} to proceed and continue the descent. They finally reached a safer place on the ridge towards 6.00 p.m. They looked for traces of their companions and cried to them but in vain. After having seen a curious weather phenomenon {{in the form of an}} arch and two crosses (later determined as a fog bow by Whymper), they continued the descent and found a resting place at 9.30 p.m. They could resume the descent at daybreak and reach Zermatt on the morning of Saturday, 15 July.|$|E
25|$|Climbing the Galibier, Eugène Christophe {{broke the}} fork of his bicycle. This {{was the third}} time in his career that this happened. He walked to the top, and down the entire descent before he <b>could</b> <b>fix</b> it. He {{finished}} the stage three hours after the winner. The leader of the race, Alavoine, also suffered from mechanical problems. His chain broke several times, and in the cold rain he had to put it back on. He also had a cold, and could not go along with his competitors. Heusghem attacked on that stage, and won back more than half an hour, and was then third in the general classification.|$|E
25|$|In the Serengeti, Ororo first {{displays}} her mutant {{ability to}} control the weather. Sometime after this, she met the witch-priestess, Ainet, who took her in and became her surrogate mother. Once, when their village {{was going through a}} terrible drought, Storm commanded rain for days just to help them. By doing this, she threw off the natural order of nature, and droughts were formed over numerous villages, and hundreds of animals were killed. Sensing the damage she had done, Ainet told Storm of her kind but ill-thought-out gesture, and of the damage she caused. Ainet took this opportunity to explain to Ororo how her powers worked with nature, and how she <b>could</b> <b>fix</b> the problem by properly distributing rain.|$|E

25|$|The amendment's proponents {{argued that}} the fixing of a time limit and the {{extending}} of it were powers committed exclusively to Congress under the political question doctrine and that in any event Congress had power to extend. It was argued that inasmuch as the fixing of a reasonable time was within Congress' power and that Congress <b>could</b> <b>fix</b> the time either in advance or at some later point, based upon its evaluation {{of the social and}} other bases of the necessities of the amendment, Congress did not do violence to the Constitution when, once having fixed the time, it subsequently extended the time. Proponents recognized that if the time limit was fixed in the text of the amendment Congress could not alter it because the time limit as well as the substantive provisions of the proposal had been subject to ratification by a number of States, making it unalterable by Congress except through the amending process again. Opponents argued that Congress, having by a two-thirds vote sent the amendment and its authorizing resolution to the states, had put the matter beyond changing by passage of a simple resolution, that states had either acted upon the entire package or at least that they had or could have acted affirmatively upon the promise of Congress that if the amendment had not been ratified within the prescribed period it would expire and their assent would not be compelled for longer than they had intended.|$|E

Brinkley responded by joking that the patient would have no problem if he had [...] "a pair of those buck [...] glands in you". The patient then begged Brinkley to try the operation, which Brinkley did, for $150. (The patient's son later told The Kansas City Star that Brinkley had in fact offered to pay his father [...] "handsomely" [...] if he'd go along with the experiment.) ...|$|E
500|$|The Who's That Girl World Tour in 1987 had Madonna {{performing}} [...] "Holiday" [...] as {{the last}} song of the tour. Madonna performed an energetic version of the song, signalling the celebratory and wholesome nature of the song's theme. She sang the final chorus twice, and on some dates asked the audience for a comb so that she <b>could</b> <b>fix</b> her hair and finished the performance. Two different performances are found in [...] tour video filmed at Stadio Communale in Turin, Italy on September 4, 1987 and the Who's That Girl: Live in Japan tour video filmed at Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo, Japan on June 22, 1987.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{served as}} the news editor for 1UP.com, the sister site to the {{magazine}} Electronic Gaming Monthly. During his tenure at 1UP, Smith wrote extensively about the Halo video game franchise, as was considered a leading fan voice; in one article, he declared Halo was the only game series he cared about. Smith wrote a feature story for 1UP in 2005 called [...] "Broken Halo", in which he explained how developer Bungie <b>could</b> <b>fix</b> problems he perceived with the game; Crecente said the article put Smith [...] "on the map". Smith also {{became one of the}} panelists of the 1UP Yours show, a weekly video games podcast featuring gaming editors and experts. [...] In 2006, Edge named him one of gaming's top 50 journalists.|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{stated that}} there were two reasons for what he {{considered}} to be the show's failure. The first was Rodgers and Hammerstein's overconfidence; they thought of themselves as Broadway's [...] "Golden Boys" [...] who could do no wrong. The other was the play-within-the-play, which had not been thoroughly thought out by anyone. According to Abbott, Hammerstein remained [...] "positively Sphinx-like" [...] on the subject. At a loss to understand the characters of the play-within-the play, Alton came up with nothing more than routine song-and-dance numbers. During the run, the duo approached choreographer Jerome Robbins and asked him if he <b>could</b> <b>fix</b> the dances. Robbins said that he could, but he would not, as [...] "it would kill Bob Alton". According to Hammerstein biographer Hugh Fordin, [...] " [...] intended contrast between onstage and backstage life was never achieved because the onstage show was so tepid and confusing." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the levity on their first train ride, the company was downcast and exhausted en route from Cleveland to Boston for the final tryouts. The show opened previews in Boston on May 6. A majority of the Boston critics liked the show, and expressed confidence that Rodgers and Hammerstein <b>could</b> <b>fix</b> {{the problems with the}} plot. The pair took out one song, [...] "Meat and Potatoes", which was felt to be too raunchy. After watching it performed by Joan McCracken, who played Betty (Carmen in the play-within-the-play), the pair decided it had too many double entendres and cut it. It was replaced by [...] "We Deserve Each Other", which the pair had written in a Cleveland hotel room. Another cut song, [...] "You Never Had It So Good", included lyrics which satirized the duo's own earlier efforts. Its lyrics, [...] "I'll sew, I'll bake / I'll try to make your evenings all enchanted. / My honeycake, / I'm yours to take, but don't take me for granted", alluded to two songs from South Pacific, [...] "Some Enchanted Evening" [...] and [...] "Honey Bun". Audiences continued to greet the show warmly.|$|E

500|$|A {{backdrop}} {{then started}} showing the newspaper reports on Madonna's 1985 Playboy nude picture release. The backdrop moves up as Madonna appears, wearing a loose-fitted black pant and top, with bejeweled glasses, for singing [...] "Where's the Party". For [...] "Into the Groove" [...] Finch joins her on stage to dance alongside. Madonna then wore a pink bolero jacket {{which had the}} can of soup and the words [...] "U" [...] and [...] "DANCE" [...] flanking it. At the end she is joined by her backup singers and dancers. Together they take a bow to the audience and finish the performance. Next Madonna sang [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] {{as a part of}} the encore, wearing the same red flamenco dress she had worn in the video. For [...] "Who's That Girl", Madonna—flanked by Finch and a male dancer—strutted around the stage, asking the audience to join her on the chorus. Lastly, Madonna performed an energetic version of [...] "Holiday", signaling the celebratory and wholesome nature of the song's theme. The song featured a new arrangement, with a guitar solo in the intermediate portion added by Leonard. She sang the final chorus twice, then asked the audience for a comb so that she <b>could</b> <b>fix</b> her hair and finished the performance, after taking a bow with her dancers to the audience.|$|E

However, many BioWare developers, such as Mary Kirby, claimed this was inaccurate, stating that [...] "Dragon Age IIIs development will not be delayed by BioWare's other games." ...|$|E

2500|$|Returning to France, Cartier-Bresson recuperated in Marseille in late 1931 and deepened his {{relationship}} with the Surrealists. He became inspired by a 1930 photograph by Hungarian photojournalist Martin Munkacsi showing three naked young African boys, caught in near-silhouette, running into the surf of Lake Tanganyika. Titled Three Boys at Lake Tanganyika, this captured the freedom, grace and spontaneity of their movement and their joy at being alive. That photograph inspired him to stop painting and to take up photography seriously. He explained, [...] "I suddenly understood that a photograph <b>could</b> <b>fix</b> eternity in an instant." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Hedrick {{was one of}} {{the first}} San Francisco artists in the early 1950s to work almost {{exclusively}} with metal. He began welding in 1952, and these efforts are considered the first kinetic-junk assemblages. Hedrick made assemblages and sculptures from beer cans, lights, broken radio and television sets, refrigerators, and washing machines he found in junkyards. [...] "What interests me", he said later, is [...] "to take garbage and make it into art, kind of ironic art." [...] He painted over the surfaces with thick layers of impasto and gesso which incorporated the work into the aesthetic of action painting. He was particularly pleased when he <b>could</b> <b>fix</b> an abandoned appliance sufficiently that at least some piece of it would work and he could turn his assemblages into moving sculptures.|$|E
2500|$|The New York City government, local {{citizens}} groups, developers, the EPA, and the USACE had {{a wide variety}} of concerns and differing visions for redevelopment in the area. The New York City government feared that designating the Gowanus Canal as a Superfund site would result in many potentially costly lawsuits against polluters. Meanwhile, the area directly to the east of the Gowanus neighborhood was rezoned for high density residential use with a strong commercial component in 2003, with plans to rezone Gowanus as well starting in 2009. With brownfield redevelopment incentives offered by the State of New York, developers look to this land as another place to build, with substantial help of public money. In February 2009, the city of New York granted a zoning change to the developer, Toll Brothers Inc., allowing for a 480-unit, twelve-story, super-block residential project, the first permitted along the waterway. [...] Toll Brothers abandoned this project in 2010 after the Gowanus Canal was declared a Superfund cleanup site, despite the city's claim that it <b>could</b> <b>fix</b> the problem more quickly.|$|E
