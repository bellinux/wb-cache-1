40|$|Graph-based {{random access}} {{protocols}} {{have emerged as}} an efficient solution to tackle the medium sharing problem for machine type communications. Their remarkable performance is well-understood for scenarios in which devices communicate with a one-hop receiver devoted to collecting packets. Many practical applications, however, foresee the receiver to also act as sender towards a second-hop terminal. Under a half-duplex operation constraint, the two tasks would typically be fulfilled by means of time sharing, triggering a tradeoff {{between the amount of}} collected and transmitted traffic at the intermediate node. In this perspective, the recent rise of effective self-interference cancellation techniques poses the intriguing question of whether and how much a full-duplex receiver could improve performance in such a setting. To cast light on the issue, we refine the asymptotic analysis of successive interference <b>cancellation</b> <b>procedures</b> at the receiver of a graph-based random access scheme. In doing so, we account for the degradation in decoding probability due to residual self-interference when operating in full-duplex mode, and derive a tight lower bound to the achievable packet loss rate.

Furthermore, it was also shown that the signal model is valid for various different RF cancellers. To control the complexity of the <b>cancellation</b> <b>procedure,</b> a novel principal component analysis based scheme was then proposed, which can be used to control the number of parameters in the signal model.

In particular, in a MIMO transceiver, the observed SI signal in each receiver consists of a combination of all the transmit signals, which means that also the SI cancellers must have all of the transmit signals available. Furthermore, {{in order to}} perform SI cancellation, the coupling channels between all the transmitters and receivers must be estimated, which results in a somewhat more demanding SI <b>cancellation</b> <b>procedure.</b> Nevertheless, this increased complexity is justified by the higher physical layer throughputs.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is dedicated}} to the study of positivity phenomena for the coefficients of the chromatic symmetric function of a graph. This function was introduced by Stanley in 1995 as a generalization of the chromatic polynomial of a graph. Stanley considered the expansion of the chromatic symmetric function in terms of various bases of symmetric functions, and conjectured the positivity of its coefficients in the basis of the elementary symmetric functions {{in the case of the}} incomparability graphs of (3 + 1) -free posets. The conjecture has not yet been proven, but has been checked for small graphs, and proven for certain families of graphs. The strongest general result in this direction was obtained by Gasharov. He proved a weaker statement, Schur positivity of the incomparability graphs of (3 + 1) -free posets. The strongest result on the positivity of the coefficients in the basis of the elementary symmetric functions was obtained by Stanley, who proved the positivity of certain sums of these coefficients by linking them to acyclic orientations of the incomparability graph. In this thesis we give a new proof of Gasharov’s theorem, which presents a combinatorial interpretation of the Schur-coefficients in terms of planar networks. Compared to Gasharov’s proof, it gives a clearer visual illustration of the <b>cancellation</b> <b>procedures</b> and is quite similar in spirit to the proof of monomial positivity of Schur functions via the Lindström–Gessel–Viennot Lemma. This construction led us to reconsider another idea of Stanley: instead of working with the chromatic symmetric function of a graph directly, we analyze certain analogs of the symmetric functions attached to graphs. We introduce a new combinatorial object: the correct sequences of unit interval orders, and using these, in certain cases, we succeed to construct combinatorial models of the coefficients appearing in Stanley’s conjecture.
