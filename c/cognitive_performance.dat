5|$|Although the {{evidence}} that cognitive deficits remain stable over time is reliable and abundant, {{much of the research}} in this domain focuses on methods to improve attention and working memory. Efforts to improve learning ability in individuals with schizophrenia using a high- versus low-reward condition and an instruction-absent or instruction-present condition revealed that increasing reward leads to poorer performance while providing instruction leads to improved performance, highlighting that some treatments may exist to increase <b>cognitive</b> <b>performance.</b> Training individuals with schizophrenia to alter their thinking, attention, and language behaviors by verbalizing tasks, engaging in cognitive rehearsal, giving self-instructions, giving coping statements to the self to handle failure, and providing self-reinforcement for success, significantly improves performance on recall tasks.

Eighteen cognitively impaired RRMS patients underwent neuropsychological evaluation by the Rao’s brief repeatable battery and resting-state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to evaluate FC of the DMN before and after a short-term (8 weeks, twice a week) cCR. A control group of 14 cognitively impaired RRMS patients was assigned to an aspecific cognitive training (aCT), and underwent the same study protocol. Correlations between DMN and <b>cognitive</b> <b>performances</b> were also tested. After cCR, there was a significant improvement of the following tests: SDMT (p < 0. 01), PASAT 3 ″ (p < 0. 00), PASAT 2 ″ (p < 0. 03), SRT-D (p < 0. 02), and 10 / 36 SPART-D (p < 0. 04); as well as a significant increase of the FC of the DMN in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and bilateral inferior parietal cortex (IPC). After cCR, a significant negative correlation between Stroop Color–Word Interference Test and FC in the PCC emerged. After aCT, the control group did not show any significant effect either on FC or neuropsychological tests. No significant differences were found in brain volumes and lesion load in both groups when comparing data acquired at baseline and after cCR or aCT. In cognitively impaired RRMS patients, cCR improves <b>cognitive</b> <b>performances</b> (i. e., processing speed and visual and verbal sustained memory), and increases FC in the PCC and IPC of the DMN.

25|$|Fatigue is a {{subjective}} feeling of tiredness which {{is distinct from}} weakness, and has a gradual onset. Unlike weakness, fatigue can be alleviated by periods of rest. Fatigue can have physical or mental causes. Physical fatigue is the transient inability of a muscle to maintain optimal physical performance, and is made more severe by intense physical exercise.

25|$|Like other opioid drugs, {{pethidine}} has {{the potential}} to cause physical dependence or addiction.

The especially severe side effects unique to pethidine among opioids—serotonin syndrome, seizures, delirium, dysphoria, tremor—are primarily or entirely due to the action of its metabolite, norpethidine.|$|E

25|$|Mental fatigue is a {{temporary}} inability to maintain optimal <b>cognitive</b> <b>performance.</b> The onset of mental fatigue during any cognitive activity is gradual, and depends upon an individual's cognitive ability, and also upon other factors, such as sleep deprivation and overall health. Mental fatigue {{has also been shown}} to decrease physical performance. It can manifest as somnolence, lethargy, or directed attention fatigue. Decreased attention is known as ego depletion and occurs when the limited 'self-regulatory capacity' is depleted. It may also be described as a more or less decreased level of consciousness. In any case, this can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as operating large vehicles. For instance, a person who is sufficiently somnolent may experience microsleep. However, objective cognitive testing can be used to differentiate the neurocognitive deficits of brain disease from those attributable to tiredness.|$|E

They performed two testing sessions at 08 : 00 h, 12 : 00 h and 16 : 00 h after either MEL (5 mg) or placebo (PLA) ingestion, in a randomized order. During each period, the participants performed the following cognitive and physical tests: reaction time and vigilance tests, medicine-ball throw (MBT), five jumps, handgrip strength (HG), and agility tests. Results <b>cognitive</b> and physical <b>performances</b> were significantly higher at 16 : 00 h compared to 08 : 00 h during the two conditions (p < 0. 05).

25|$|Over {{a two-week}} {{treatment}} of healthy volunteers, sertraline slightly improved verbal fluency {{but did not}} affect word learning, short-term memory, vigilance, flicker fusion time, choice reaction time, memory span, or psychomotor coordination. In spite of lower subjective rating, that is, feeling that they performed worse, no clinically relevant differences were observed in the objective <b>cognitive</b> <b>performance</b> {{in a group of}} people treated for depression with sertraline for 1.5years as compared to healthy controls. In children and adolescents taking sertraline for six weeks for anxiety disorders, 18 out of 20measures of memory, attention and alertness stayed unchanged. Divided attention was improved and verbal memory under interference conditions decreased marginally. Because of the large number of measures taken, it is possible that these changes were still due to chance.

25|$|The neurobehavioral {{assessment}} battery {{that was}} used in the Van Dongen et al. study included the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT).

The PVT detects changes in basic neurobehavioral performance that involve vigilant attention, response speed, and impulsivity; and it has been extensively validated in ground-based laboratory studies to detect cognitive deficits that are caused by a variety of factors (e.g., restricted sleep, sleep/wake shifts, motion sickness, residual sedation from sleep medications). The PVT is an optimal tool for repeated use, in contrast to some other cognitive measures, as studies have shown no minimal learning effects and aptitude differences when using the PVT.|$|E
25|$|To {{eliminate}} most complaints, {{the total}} indoor CO2 level should {{be reduced to}} a difference of less than 600 ppm above outdoor levels. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) considers that indoor air concentrations of carbon dioxide that exceed 1,000 ppm are a marker suggesting inadequate ventilation. The UK standards for schools say that carbon dioxide in all teaching and learning spaces, when measured at seated head height and averaged over the whole day should not exceed 1,500 ppm. The whole day refers to normal school hours (i.e. 9:00am to 3:30pm) and includes unoccupied periods such as lunch breaks. In Hong Kong, the EPD established indoor air quality objectives for office buildings and public places in which a carbon dioxide level below 1,000 ppm is considered to be good. European standards limit carbon dioxide to 3,500 ppm. OSHA limits carbon dioxide concentration in the workplace to 5,000 ppm for prolonged periods, and 35,000 ppm for 15 minutes. These higher limits are concerned with avoiding loss of consciousness (fainting), and do not address impaired <b>cognitive</b> <b>performance</b> and energy, which begin to occur at lower concentrations of carbon dioxide.|$|E
30|$|Participants {{included}} in our study came from the Safe Move cohort, which comprised 1200 drivers over 70  years old.
