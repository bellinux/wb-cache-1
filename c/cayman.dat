5|$|In {{anticipation}} of a tropical storm, warnings were issued for the <b>Cayman</b> Islands, the northwestern and central Bahamas, and the Cuban provinces of Matanzas, Cienfuegos, Villa Clara, Sancti Spíritus, and Ciego de Ávila on September28. However, the warnings were discontinued the following day after reports of the storm's prompt dissipation. After forecasters warned of severe weather across the <b>Cayman</b> Islands, schools and government offices closed in low-lying areas, and emergency teams cleaned out storm drains and readied shelters. Thunderstorms in Grand <b>Cayman</b> forced <b>Cayman</b> Airways to cancel all express flights to <b>Cayman</b> Brac and Little <b>Cayman</b> on October29; weather-resistant jet service was provided to stranded passengers. A marine warning was required for all three islands due to rough sea conditions.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cayman</b> Islands were {{expected}} to suffer badly if Hurricane Dean passed too close, and mandatory evacuations were instigated for the low-lying Little <b>Cayman.</b> Tourists were forbidden from entering the island and extra flights were added to evacuate those that were already there. Schools and civic centers were converted to shelters on Grand <b>Cayman</b> and <b>Cayman</b> Brac, and, despite the mandatory evacuation, one shelter was opened on Little <b>Cayman</b> for the residents who remained there. Expecting catastrophic damage, two Royal Navy ships of the Atlantic Patrol Task (North), HMS Portland and RFA Wave Ruler, followed 150mi (240km) behind the storm in order to arrive at <b>Cayman</b> as soon after the hurricane as possible.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>Cayman</b> Islands, gusts to 51mph (82km/h) {{stirred up}} rough seas with 810ft (2.53m) waves, which caused some light erosion along {{southern}} and western shores. Rainfall {{over the region}} was heavy and widespread, although the greatest quantities fell over Grand Cayman; the Owen Roberts International Airport recorded 9.02in (229mm) over a two-day period. Overall damage to the islands was limited: The blustery rains flooded low-lying areas, caused roof leaks, and knocked out the power in eastern Grand <b>Cayman.</b>|$|E
5|$|On the <b>Cayman</b> Islands, the {{hurricane}} caused strong waves, gusty winds, and heavy rainfall at times. Damage was relatively minimal, amounting to blown out windows and beach erosion.

Although El Salvador received the necessary 3 points, {{the performance of the}} team was not as expected.
