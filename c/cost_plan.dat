The result is numerous competing insurance plans that are available to federal employees. Local plans have ready access to participation in the program, but the underlying statute prohibits entry of new national plans. Because OPM requires plans to price offerings closely to the health care costs of enrollees, and to offer comprehensive benefits, there is broad similarity in plan offerings. However, total premiums can vary substantially, and in 2010 the lowest <b>cost</b> <b>plan</b> option has a self-only premium cost of about $2,800 and the highest <b>cost</b> <b>plan</b> option for self-only enrollment is about $7,200. As an example of benefit variation, a cap of about $5,000 a year on potential out-of-pocket costs for self-only enrollment is found in a number of plans, but in some plans the cap may reach $15,000 or more (HMOs typically have no cap, but control potential cost exposure by using copayments).|$|E

Several researches indicated that pre-tender estimating accuracies are significantly affected by the level of risk information available to the estimators. Proper risk analysis could offer at least a partial solution by reducing the variances between design stage elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plans</b> and final tender sums (contract sums) of construction projects. This study investigates the accuracy in design stage elemental <b>cost</b> <b>planning</b> with a view to identifying risk factors influencing the accuracy. Project data were obtained through interviews and thematic analysis identified the risk factors. Analysis of documents obtained from the archives of study participants (consultant quantity surveyors) complemented the responses from the interviews. Findings revealed deviations of elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plans</b> from final tender sums in the region of - 14 % and + 13 %. These results confirmed a significant disparity between elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plans</b> and final tender sums.

40|$|Accuracy {{of early}} cost {{estimates}} {{is a major}} concern for clients and cost engineers. Several researchers have long expressed their concern about cost estimating inaccuracies by recognising that the accuracy achieved in cost estimating has been less than desirable. The essence of having accurate design stage cost estimate as a reliable budgetary tool is defeated if the factors that affect design stage cost estimating accuracy and the critical methods for improving the subject are not given adequate consideration in the estimation process. Hence, project objectives regarding cost, time and quality targets are threatened. This paper first identifies various factors affecting design stage cost estimating accuracy in construction practice. Also, it provides a review of the influencing methods for improving design stage cost estimating accuracy of building projects by demonstrating the theoretical context.

40|$|Abstract ̶ This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the capabilities of}} BIM (Building Information Modeling) in leveraging Whole Life Cycle Cost (WLCC) data requirements to perform WLCC calculations and produce WLLC estimates. The research determines {{the extent to which}} WLCC data, such as time, interest rates, escalation rates and real costs can be attached to parametric BIM data to be used effectively to create speedier and more accurate real-time WLLC analysis. Without incorporating WLCC data in the BIM, a complete picture of a construction project’s WLCC cannot be formed from the default outputs of the model. BIM 5 D applications such as CostX utilise the parametric properties of the model, providing users with the ability to generate information and quantities from the BIM to be used in a formatted <b>cost</b> <b>plan.</b> The benefit of the 5 D process is that selected quantity surveying information in the BIM can be live linked from the model to the <b>cost</b> <b>plan</b> providing a real-time analysis of WLLC. The authors demonstrate in this paper how they leverage BIM, by incorporating WLCC data and calculations in a customised CostX workbook, thus providing the authors with the ability to live link the output values from the model to the values in the workbook to perform WLCC.

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of final tender sums (contract sums) of building projects depends on reliable projections of baseline cost plans {{developed at the}} design development stage. However, {{no matter how much}} care and effort is put into the preparation of design stage elemental cost plans, deviations are usually observed between these cost plans and the final tender sum. This makes accurate predictions challenging for construction practitioners in New Zealand. The major attributable factors for the observed variability are inherent risks in the design stage elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plan</b> development. Whilst this is recognised, this study evaluates the reliability of elemental cost plans in traditional building procurement. The study seeks to answer the question: is elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plan</b> a reliable budgetary tool for construction projects? The study was undertaken based on 20 completed building projects from which secondary data were collected within the New Zealand construction industry. Data analysis was carried out using document analysis and percentage deviation of final tender sums from the cost plans. Further analyses were carried out using root mean square and relative mean absolute deviation methods of analyses. The results showed that the budgetary reliability of elemental cost plans varied depending on project types. Whilst a deviation of - 3. 67 % and + 3. 95 % was obtained on the residential projects analysed, the deviation on educational projects was between - 3. 98 % and + 12. 15 %. Commercial projects attracted - 14. 22 % and + 16. 33 % while in the case of refurbishment projects, a deviation of - 10. 07 % and + 30. 14 % was obtained.
