40|$|Diets high in {{red meat}} {{and low in}} green {{vegetables}} are {{associated with an increased}} risk of colon cancer. In rats, dietary heme, mimicking red meat, increases colonic cytotoxicity and proliferation of the colonocytes, whereas addition of chlorophyll from green vegetables inhibits these heme-induced effects. Chlorophyllin is a water-soluble hydrolysis product of chlorophyll that inhibits the toxicity of many planar aromatic compounds. The present study investigated whether <b>chlorophyllins</b> could inhibit the heme-induced luminal cytotoxicity and colonic hyperproliferation as natural chlorophyll does. Rats were fed a purified control diet, the control diet supplemented with heme, or a heme diet with 1. 2 mmol/kg diet of chlorophyllin, copper chlorophyllin, or natural chlorophyll for 14 d (n = 8 /group). The cytotoxicity of fecal water was determined with an erythrocyte bioassay and colonic epithelial cell proliferation was quantified in vivo by [methyl- 3 H]thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA. Exfoliation of colonocytes was measured as the amount of rat DNA in feces using quantitative PCR analysis. Heme caused a > 50 -fold increase in the cytotoxicity of the fecal water, a nearly 100 % increase in proliferation, and almost total inhibition of exfoliation of the colonocytes. Furthermore, the addition of heme increased TBARS in fecal water. Chlorophyll, but not the <b>chlorophyllins,</b> completely prevented these heme-induced effects. In conclusion, inhibition of the heme-induced colonic cytotoxicity and epithelial cell turnover is specific for natural chlorophyll and cannot be mimicked by water-soluble <b>chlorophyllins...</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in sodium copper chlorophyllin (Cu-Chl) as a food colourant and supplement owing to its beneficial biological activities. Studies have revealed that this green pigment inhibits experimental carcinogenesis and interacts with proteins and genotoxic agents. Health-related activities have also {{been associated with the}} prevention of lipid peroxidation. However, intestinal absorption of this pigment has been considered insignificant, raising questions of whether eventual biological properties are related to pre- or post-absorptive actions. In this study, intestinal absorption of Cu-Chl and its appearance in serum and organs were estimated by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis in rat feeding experiments. The effect of ingested Cu-Chl on lipid peroxidation was analysed by measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and antioxidant enzyme activities in hepatic and brain tissues of oxidative stress-induced rats. RESULTS: The two main components of commercial Cu-Chl, namely Cu-chlorin e(6) and Cu-chlorin e(4), showed different digestive behaviours, and only Cu-chlorin e 4 was found in serum, liver and kidneys. Antioxidant activity in vivo could be observed in brain and seemed to be related to in situ protection but not to antioxidant enzyme modulation. CONCLUSION: As {{at least one of the}} major components of Cu-Chl is effectively absorbed, further pharmacolkinetic studies are encouraged to access absorption rates and the role of ingested copper <b>chlorophyllins</b> in mammals.

Moreover, their antioxidant activities were evaluated and {{compared with that of}} ascorbic acid through four biochemical assays: DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity, reducing power, inhibition of β-carotene bleaching and O 2 – scavenging activity. SZC had better antioxidant properties at a lower dosage than SIC and SCC in all assays. In the β-carotene bleaching assay, EC 50 of SZC, SIC and SCC was 0. 04, 0. 38 and 0. 90 mg/mL, respectively, much lower than that of ascorbic acid (4. 0 mg/mL). SZC showed a better result (p< 0. 05) than ascorbic acid in the O 2 – scavenging activity assay.

Ascorbate analogs were tested in combination with copper <b>chlorophyllin</b> complexes for potential additive or synergistic activity. Materials and methods: For hyaluronidase activity assays, dilutions of test materials were evaluated for hydrolytic activity of hyaluronidase by precipitation of non-digested hyaluronate by measuring related turbidity at 595 nm. High-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy was used to analyze and identify the primary small molecule constituents in various old and new commercial lots of sodium copper <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex. Results: The most active small molecule component of sodium copper <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex was disodium copper isochlorin e 4, followed by oxidized disodium copper isochlorin e 4. Sodium copper <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex and copper isochlorin e 4 disodium salt had hyaluronidase inhibitory activity down to 10 µg/mL. The oxidized form of copper isochlorin e 4 disodium salt had substantial hyaluronidase inhibitory activity at 100 µg/mL but not at 10 µg/mL.

Benzo(a) pyrene, the food pyrolysate 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 - phenylimidazo [4, 5]pyridine or PhIP and 2 - aminoanthracene were used as mutagens in most experiments. These agents exert mutagenic activity only in the presence of mamalian metabolic activation. In all experiments the mutagenic activity of the three chemicals could be abolished by the presence of 2 mg of <b>chlorophyllin</b> or 0, 5 mg of hematin per selection plate. Considering the results of experiments in which <b>chlorophyllin</b> and hematin were added at several different times after the addition of the metabolic activation system it was concluded that the formed mutagenic metabolites were trapped and inactivated by these porfyrines. The antimutagenic activities of these porfyrines decreased when the porfyrine ring was destroyed as appeared from experiments with biliverdin and bilirubin. Due to its low solubility the antimutagenic activity of chlorophyll is not or nearly not demonstrable. The antimutagenic activity of <b>chlorophyllin</b> or hematin on substances that are mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activation such as MNNG, furazolidone, dimetridazole, epichlorohydrin and 2 -chloroethanol is lower or absent...|$|R
40|$|Fasciolosis is a {{waterborne}} disease, {{caused by}} Fasciola species. Snail Lymnaea acuminata is an intermediate host of these flukes. Control of snail population is major tool {{in reducing the}} incidences. Variation in light intensity and wavelength caused significant changes in reproduction pattern of snails. Maximum fecundity was noted with bait containing carbohydrate (starch, 468 ± 0. 10 / 20 snails) or amino acid (serine, 319 ± 0. 29 / 20 snails) as attractant. Sublethal feeding of <b>chlorophyllin</b> bait with starch or serine attractant to infected and uninfected snails caused significant reduction in fecundity, hatchability, and survivability. These significant changes are observed in snails exposed to different spectral band of visible light and sunlight. Maximum fecundity of 536 ± 2. 0 and minimum of 89. 3 ± 0. 4 were noted in snails not fed with bait and exposed to sunlight and red spectral band, respectively. There was complete arrest in the fecundity of infected and uninfected snails and no survivability of uninfected snails after 48 [*]h feeding with bait containing <b>chlorophyllin</b> + attractant. Minimum hatchability (9. 25 ± 0. 5) was noted in red light exposed, <b>chlorophyllin</b> + starch fed infected snails and hatching period of bait fed snails was prolonged. Conclusively, <b>chlorophyllin</b> bait and red light reduce reproduction capacity in snails...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Co-sensitization {{of natural}} dyes on TiO 2 for {{dye-sensitized solar cell}} (DSSC) was {{proposed}} between <b>chlorophyllin</b> (C) and xanthophyll (X at various volume ratios of C/X. <b>Chlorophyllin</b> is chlorophyll derivative providing-COOH groups essential for binding to TiO 2. The chlorophyll was extracted from dried spinach (Amaranthusviridis) leaves in a mixture ofmethanol-acetone (70 %: 30 %). Chlorophyll extract dye was obtained after partition of the crude extracts in diethyl ether solution. Then, it was hydrolyzed under alkaline condition to get <b>chlorophyllin.</b> Xanthophyll was extracted from fresh petal of chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum indicum) flowers. Blending of <b>chlorophyllin</b> and xanthophyll was carried out at various volume ratios of C to X (1 : 0, 5 : 1, 1 : 1, 1 : 5, 0 : 1). Titania solar cells were constructed in sandwich system of conducting glass-titania/dyes as the photoanode and conducting glass-platinum as the photocathode. Electrolyte solution containing I-/I 3 - was inserted between the electrodes by capillary action. All dye extracts and blending solutions were analyzed by UV-Vis spectrophotometer. It is shown that the absorption spectra of blending dyes are complimentary in the visible region resulted in a panchromatic response of the dyes. From the cyclic voltammogram of the dyes and blended-dyes, {{it is found that}} the energy level of xanthophyll is the lowest. TheI-V test at 100 mw/cm 2 irradiation confirmed that the energy conversion efficienc...|$|R

40|$|Background : Endothelial {{dysfunction}} {{is well-known}} {{as an early}} stage of atherosclerosis. Increased oxidative stress inhypercholesterolemia triggers endothelial dysfunction that is characterized by decreased biological availability ofnitric oxide (NO). Experimental studies showed that <b>chlorophyllin</b> had an effective antioxidant activity. Objectives : To determine the effect of <b>chlorophyllin</b> on nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) level ofhypercholesterolemic rats. Methods : Post test only randomized control groupusedtwenty four male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly dividedinto four groups: without treatment (technical control/K 1), hypercholesterolemic (negative control/K 2),hypercholesterolemic with <b>chlorophyllin</b> at dose of 1, 8 mg/ 200 g/d (P 1) and hypercholesterolemic with <b>chlorophyllin</b> atdose of 3, 34 mg/ 200 g/d (P 2). <b>Chlorophyllin</b> was dissolved in water and was given via nasogastric tube for 21 days afterthe rats got hypercholesterolemia. Total cholesterol level of blood was measured by CHOD-PAP method, level of NOplasma was measured by Griess reaction and level of MDA plasma was measured by TBARS method. Hypothesis testwas analyzed by One Way Anova continued by Post hoc LSD test and Kruskall Wallis by significant level of 0, 05. Results :NO plasma level was the lowest in group P 2 (0. 203 + 0. 015 μM) and the highest in the group K 2 (0, 224 ± 0, 001 μM), but no difference of NO plasma level among groups (p = 0. 118). There were differences in MDA plasma levelamong the groups (p = 0. 001). P 1 and P 2 groups had lower MDA plasma level than K 2 (2. 40 + 0. 11 nmol/ml), indicatedby (1. 94 + 0. 07 nmol/ml, p= 0. 0001) and (1, 37 + 0. 13 nmol/ml, p= 0. 0001) respectively, but still higher than K 1 (0. 94 + 0. 05 nmol/ml, p= 0. 0001). Conclusion : The treatment of chlrophyllin does not have an effect of NO plasma level, but gives an effect of lowerMDA plasma level...|$|R
40|$|Funder: BBSRC RONO: BBS/E/W/ 10962 A 01 DIncidents of {{foodborne}} illness associated with consuming undercooked or raw chicken are often linked to 2 causative pathogens: Campylobacter spp. or Salmonella spp. Numerous {{studies have shown}} that contamination of carcasses results when pathogens are transferred from the intestinal tract or fecal material on feet and feathers to the dressed carcass. Ultraviolet spectral imaging to detect surface fecal and ingesta contamination on poultry carcasses may provide a solution to aid detection. However, poultry diets do not provide sufficiently high levels of natural fluorophores for this system to be reliable. This study investigated the potential of chlorophyll-based feed additives to improve fluorescence of the feces and narrow the excitation and emission wavelengths to aid {{in the development of a}} simple visualization system. Twenty-four hens (Gallus gallus domesticus) were allocated at random to 1 of 4 treatments: control (C, no marker), Zn <b>chlorophyllin,</b> Mg <b>chlorophyllin,</b> or Fe <b>chlorophyllin.</b> All markers were incorporated into mash before pelleting at a rate of 1 g/kg of DM. The experiment consisted of two 4 ? 4 Latin squares with each period consisting of 2 wk. Feces were collected and extracted in acetone:water (50 : 50; vol/vol) with fecal fluorescence emission spectra determined using a Jasco FP- 6200 Spectrofluorometer with excitation at 382 nm. A main peak evolved at wavelength 670 nm with the total area under the peak used as fluorescence intensity. Following 7 d of marker supplementation, the 3 markers improved the fluorescence intensity by ? 14. 8, 12. 8, and 6. 9 for Fe, Mg, and Zn <b>chlorophyllin,</b> respectively, compared with the control. The addition of feces containing Mg <b>chlorophyllin</b> to chicken carcass increased detection of the feces compared with feces with no marker. Also, due to the plain background of chicken skin, a simple image at 675 nm with appropriate thresholds would allow detection of contaminated carcasses at the current slaughter line speed without the need of expensive hyperspectral imaging.
