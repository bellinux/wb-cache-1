40|$|Abstract. - Classical one-parameter harvest {{policies}} (such {{as those}} based on maintaining a <b>constant</b> optimal <b>catch,</b> <b>constant</b> optimal fishing mortality rate, or constant optimal escapement) and full optimal control solutions (such as those generated through stochas-tic dynamic programming) represent two {{ends of a}} spectrum of possible harvest control rules. The classical one-parameter policies have little flexibility and may be substantially sub-optimal, but are easy to describe. True optimal control policies, on the other hand, are completely flexible and fully optimal, {{but they can be}} inaccessible. As a compromise between the classical one-parameter policies and a full optimal control solution, several authors have suggested that fisheries be managed by specifying the functional form of a control rule a priori and then choosing values for {{one or more of the}} parameters so as to maximize a management objective function. The purpose of this paper is to gain an increased understanding of how such harvest control rules can be used to address the problem of optimal fishery management. This is undertaken in three stages, proceeding in order of increasing complexity. In Stage 1, the analysis assumes that population dynamics are completely deterministic and that the values of all biological parameters are known with certainty. Here, the focus of optimization is on maximum sustainable yield (MSY). In Stage 2, the analysis is generalized to the case in which natural (stochastic) variability is present but the values of all biological parameters are still known with certainty. Here, the focus of optimization is on a stochastic analogue of MSY, with attention paid also to tradeoffs between long-term average yield and the level of variability around that average. In Stage 3, the analysis is further generalized to the case in which natural variability is present and the values of biological parameters are uncertain. Here, the focus of optimization is o...|$|R

The assessment is also generalised to allow for a second fleet to accommodate data from a pot fishery that has been in operation since November 2004. Results obtained show a much greater selectivity for larger toothfish for the pot than for the longline fishery – a feature which has important implications for the status of the population.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} multispecies {{model for}} the fishery of capelin, cod and herring (Systmod) in the Norwegian Sea-Barents Sea region has been developed and used in analysing the impact of different fishery management strategies on stock and yield. The study shows that the biomass production of capelin {{is the most important}} factor for the obtainable yield of cod, and the recruitment and life pattern of the herring govern the recruitment of capelin. The recruitment of herring and cod is linked to the ocean climate, which may alternate with warm and cold periods. Cannibalism is also an important factor for cod in adapting to the periodic changes of the system. Most of the production takes place in the warm periods, and capelin and cod have to be harvested when the stocks are large in order to obtain an optimal sustainable catch. The stocks cannot be accumulated in their most productive phase for the benefit of increased catches when the biomass production is low, due to the short life span of capelin, and to the stock interrelationship between the two species. The sustainable yield of herring is more dependent on climate changes than on the stock interrelationships and may be harvested with the <b>constant</b> yearly <b>catch</b> quotas if the time lags between the warm periods are short. A high frequency of warm periods is favourable for the herring, but has a negative effect on the obtainable yield of capelin and cod.

Most of these species have either disappeared or declined to very low levels. Due to lack of commercial fish species for harvest, the fishers by 1998 / 9 resorted to harvesting the haplochromines, Clarias carsoni and edible frogs (Xenopus kigesiensis) as alternative resources.

This update also incorporates tag-recapture data and a new basis to estimate the extent of cetacean depredation. For the Base Case and many of the assessment sensitivities the resource is estimated to be at a depletion (in relation to its average pre-exploitation level in terms of spawning biomass) in the 55 - 60 % range.

We compared traditional constant effort policies to more complex escapement policies (control of spawning stock size) using three criteria: {{the difficulty of}} estimating policy parameters, the average harvest obtained, and the variability in harvest. Substantial computational effort was required to obtain optimal estimates for the two-parameter escapement policies, and a single run usually required 24 h or more to complete on a microcomputer. Conservative escapement policies were similar in form and in performance to constant effort policies. Mean harvest under the least-conservative escapement policy was only about 2 % greater than mean harvest under a constant effort policy, yet variability in harvest increased by 4 %. For stocks where density dependence is not strong, we suggest that only minor improvement will be gained {{through the use of}} two-parameter escapement policies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{implications}} of introducing a stochastic stock in a multi-gear and age structured bio-economic model for the Northern Atlantic Bluefin tuna. In order to account for variations on the recruitment, uncertainty is introduced on a bilinear recruitment function, and it is represented by an exponential random error term leading the stock to be, on average, higher than in the deterministic case. Both the bionomic equilibrium and the optimal management of this species are examined. In the latter, two alternative instruments are studied: the <b>constant</b> total allowable <b>catch</b> and the <b>constant</b> effort and the purpose is to maximize the expected total net present value. The conclusions enhance that the results do not differ significantly from those in the deterministic model, that is, the fishing effort should be the policy instrument to adopt, both in the East and the West Atlantic. Despite the previous reasoning, the shock on recruitment should be taken into account, as certain realizations of the random variable may lead to different results. In particular, for low Bluefin tuna stock levels, it is optimal to regulate the caches instead of the fishing effort, to ensure the stock recovery...|$|R

Age compositions of catches were either prescribed from empirical data or created with fishing mortality coefficient (F), which was assumed constant with age after the age of full recruitment. The computations were done with different catch levels for six years assuming average constant recruitment. Essential results of this study are: a) The stock left in the sea decreases with increasing catch and reaches an equilibrium if recruitment and <b>catches</b> remain <b>constant.</b> With similar <b>catch</b> levels this equilibrium is reached earlier with longline and is higher than that of trawl. b) If a given level of stock in sea is desired,. higher annual catches can be taken with longlines than with trawl. c) By the same catch size longlines remove more older and more piscivorous fish which is beneficial to recruitment if the latter is largely controlled by predation. The above mentioned essential results indicate, among others that some longline fishing might be allowed to continue when TAC for trawlers has been reached...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of the Prince Edward Islands (PEI) toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) resource carried out by Brandão and Butterworth (2015 a) is updated to take further data available for 2015 and 2016 (up to May) into account. This update again also incorporates (now updated) tag-recapture data and a new basis to estimate the extent of cetacean depredation. For the Base case {{and many of the}} assessment sensitivities the resource is estimated to be at a depletion (in relation to its average pre-exploitation level in terms of spawning biomass) in the 51 - 58 % range (slightly better than before the new data were added, though the resource remains estimated to be decreasing in abundance). Introduction of the tag-recapture data hardly changes point estimates but does reduce estimation variance. Projections suggest that the resource would increase slowly under <b>constant</b> annual future <b>catches</b> of 500 t. This would remain the case for somewhat higher catches as well, but it remains a concern that {{for the last three years}} (2011 - 2013) of the longline CPUE is well below model predictions. The trotline CPUE does however show a slight increase in the 2015 compared to the 2014 index, which is the lowest in the series. Viewed overall, and pending the development of an OMP to take the assessment uncertainties into account in a better manner, a TAC increase (if any) for the 2016 / 17 season would seem best to be kept small...|$|R
