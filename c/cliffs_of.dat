5|$|At 4.00 a.m. on 17 September, Hellenic {{components}} of the 1st Division Group raided mount Preslap, a key position housing Bulgarian artillery. The Greeks rapidly descended from Golo Bilo and then began climbing the <b>cliffs</b> <b>of</b> Preslap with their bare hands. The Preslap garrison proceeded to abandon their positions and retreat eastwards. Having lost their artillery cover forces at Zborsko followed their comrades in retreat. The Timok Division conquered Topolets and advanced towards Studena Voda and Preslap while the Morava and Yugoslav Divisions overran Koutskov Kamene. At the same time, the Drina and Danube Divisions seized Gradešnica along with the Poltsista and Besistsa peaks, then halted at Melinitsa.|$|E

5|$|Geologically {{the summit}} of the fell forms part of the Deepdale Formation, (principally volcaniclastic sandstone) {{underlain}} by the dacitic lapilli-tuff of the Helvellyn Formation. The geology of much of the Lake District is the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, of which Nethermost Pike is part, and is late Ordovician in age. The eastern <b>cliffs</b> <b>of</b> the range, including those of Nethermost Pike, are rich in base minerals. When these rocks weather they form areas of fertile soil, which together with the area's inaccessibility and climate provide suitable conditions for plants of biological importance.|$|E
5|$|Rockfalls {{from the}} {{limestone}} <b>cliffs</b> <b>of</b> the Avon Gorge {{have caused a}} hazard to motorists on occasion and every year the road is closed to allow for inspection of the cliffs for potentially dangerous cracks and loose rocks, and to allow remedial works. In 1980, a glass fibre reinforced concrete canopy was constructed over the Portway close to where it passes below the Clifton Suspension Bridge, {{in order to protect}} traffic from such rock falls.|$|E
5|$|Sunnyside walk-in campground, {{better known}} as Camp 4, was built in 1929. Rock climbers, who started to scale the <b>cliffs</b> <b>of</b> Yosemite in the 1950s, camped there. In 1997, a flood in Yosemite Valley {{destroyed}} employee housing in the valley. The Park Service wanted to build dormitories next to Camp 4, but Tom Frost, the American Alpine Club and others succeeded in killing the plan. Camp 4 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 21, 2003, because of {{its role in the}} development of rock climbing as a sport.|$|E

5|$|The {{disappearance}} of Nungesser and Coli has an extensive legacy, and {{is referred to}} in many films and museums. A street in Paris is named after the aviators, and a commemorative postage stamp was issued in 1967.

5|$|There {{has been}} a castle on the site since the early 14th century, when the Sinclair family, Earls of Caithness and Barons of Roslin, {{fortified}} the site, although the present ruins are of slightly later date. Following destruction during the War of the Rough Wooing of 1544, the castle was rebuilt. This structure, built into the <b>cliffs</b> <b>of</b> Roslin Glen, has remained at least partially habitable ever since. The castle is accessed via a high bridge, which replaced an earlier drawbridge. Roslin was renovated in the 1980s and now serves as holiday accommodation.|$|E
5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for heights. In common with other approaches {{on this side of}} the mountain, it has the advantage of giving an extensive view of the <b>cliffs</b> <b>of</b> the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.|$|E

5|$|Heather moor {{containing}} ling, bell heather, cross-leaved heath, {{bog myrtle}} and fescues is everywhere abundant. The high Black Cuillins weather too slowly {{to produce a}} soil that sustains a rich plant life, but each of the main peninsulas has an individual flora. The basalt underpinnings of Trotternish produce a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn marigold and corn spurry. The sea <b>cliffs</b> <b>of</b> Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush. There is {{a fine example of}} Brachypodium-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, bird cherry, and hawthorn.|$|E
5|$|However, the Sogdians epitomized the {{religious}} plurality found along the trade routes. The largest body of Sogdian texts are Buddhist, and Sogdians {{were among the}} principal translators of Buddhist sutras into Chinese. However, Buddhism did not take root in Sogdiana itself. Additionally, the Bulayiq monastery {{to the north of}} Turpan contained Sogdian Christian texts and there are numerous Manichaean texts in Sogdiana from nearby Qocho. The reconversion of Sogdians from Buddhism to Zoroastrianism coincided with the adoption of Zoroastrianism by the Sassanid Empire of Persia. From the 4th century onwards, Sogdian Buddhist pilgrims left behind evidence of their travels along the steep <b>cliffs</b> <b>of</b> the Indus River and Hunza Valley. It was here that they carved images of the Buddha and holy stupas in addition to their full names, in hopes that the Buddha would grant them his protection.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1941, Galland {{took off}} with lobster and {{champagne}} to celebrate General Theo Osterkamp's birthday at Le Touquet, France. He made a detour with his wingman towards England, looking for RAF aircraft. Off the <b>cliffs</b> <b>of</b> Dover, he spotted a group of Spitfires. Galland attacked and claimed two confirmed and one unconfirmed shot down. The actual result was the destruction of one Spitfire; {{the other two were}} damaged in force landings with both pilots wounded. During the combat, Galland's undercarriage had dropped causing one of the RAF pilots (Flight Lieutenant Paddy Finucane) to claim Galland's aircraft as destroyed, but Galland landed without incident at Le Touquet and presented Osterkamp with his gifts. Galland's success that day represented his 60th and 61st aerial victory.|$|E

5|$|On 17 December 1851, a {{squadron}} of Brazilian ships, consisting of four steamships, three corvettes and one brig {{under the command of}} Grenfell, forced a passage of the Paraná River in the battle which became known as the Passage of the Tonelero. The Argentines had formed a powerful defensive line at The Tonelero Pass, near the <b>cliffs</b> <b>of</b> Acevedo, protected by 16 pieces of artillery and 2,000 riflemen under the command of general Lucio Norberto Mansilla. The Argentine troops exchanged fire with the Brazilian warships but were unable to prevent them from progressing upriver. The following day, the Brazilian ships returned and broke their way through The Tonelero's defenses, carrying the remaining troops of Marques de Sousa's Brazilian division upstream towards Gualeguaichu. This second influx of ships caused Mansilla and his soldiers to withdraw in chaos, abandoning their artillery, believing that the Allies were intending to land and attack their positions from the rear.|$|E
5|$|The South Africans and Rhodesians {{launched}} a two-pronged {{assault on the}} German positions over the road to Bologna at 22:30 on 15 April 1945. The Cape Town Highlanders' advance up the steep <b>cliffs</b> <b>of</b> Monte Sole was obstructed by a German minefield that guarded the peak. The Rhodesian officer commanding the leading platoon, Second Lieutenant GB Mollett, took a section of men and dashed through the minefield to the summit; for this he later received the Distinguished Service Order. Hand-to-hand fighting on Monte Sole continued until dawn, when the Germans withdrew. The Witwatersrand Rifles meanwhile took Monte Caprara. The Cape Town Highlanders took Monte Abelle late on 16 April, advancing under heavy artillery fire to the summit before clearing it of Germans. The regiment lost 31 killed and 76 wounded during these actions, including three Rhodesians killed and three wounded.|$|E
5|$|The Waterloo Bay {{massacre}} or Elliston massacre {{refers to}} a fatal clash between settlers and Aboriginal Australians in late May 1849 on the <b>cliffs</b> <b>of</b> Waterloo Bay near Elliston, South Australia {{which led to the}} deaths of a number of Aboriginal people, and forms part of the Australian frontier wars. The events leading up to the fatal clash included killings of three white settlers by Aboriginal people, and the killing of one Aboriginal person and the death by poisoning of five others by white settlers. The limited archival records indicate that three Aboriginal people were killed or died of wounds from the clash, and five were captured, however, accounts of the killing of up to 260 Aboriginal people at the cliffs have persistently circulated since at least 1880.|$|E
