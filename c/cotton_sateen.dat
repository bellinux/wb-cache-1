5000|$|The M-1951 field {{jacket was}} a US Army four pocket jacket made of 9-ounce wind {{resistant}} water repellent treated <b>cotton</b> <b>sateen</b> cloth in Olive Green Shade 107 (OG 107). [...] It was redesignated as the M-1951 field coat in November 1956.|$|E
50|$|The {{trousers}} {{were made}} {{out of the same}} <b>cotton</b> <b>sateen</b> material and regular cotton twill. They were made similarly to the khaki trousers, with better design features. They also had buttoned tabs at the waist in order to cinch the waist in.|$|E
50|$|By 2006, {{the sisters}} {{had created a}} 7-piece {{collection}} that included the T-shirt, a pair of <b>cotton</b> <b>sateen</b> leggings, and a cashmere wool tank dress. Barneys New York bought the entire first collection. The brand has expanded to include ready-to-wear, resort, handbags, sunglasses, and shoes.|$|E
5000|$|The outer {{hood of the}} M-51 Fishtail Parka is {{integral}} to the parka shell, an added hood liner {{as well as a}} button in main liner make the M-51 a versatile 3 piece parka.The idea behind this 3 part system was to enable a more customisable parka that allowed for easier cleaning of the shell as the hood fur was on the detachable hood liner, not fixed to the shell as in the M-48. It also allowed for both liners to be buttoned in or our depending on the temperature and hence warmth required. It was also cheaper than the M-48 to mass-produceThe early M-51 was made of heavy <b>sateen</b> <b>cotton,</b> the same material as the M-48. Later revisions of the M-51 were poplin based. The later liners were also revised from the [...] "heavy when wet" [...] wool pile to a lighter woolen loop or frieze wool design that dried easier and were far lighter. The frieze liners were constructed of mohair and were designed using a double loop system which repelled cold weather.|$|R
50|$|The kimono and obi are {{traditionally}} made of hemp, linen, silk, silk brocade, silk crepes (such as chirimen) and satin weaves (such as rinzu). Modern kimonos {{are widely available}} in less-expensive easy-care fabrics such as rayon, <b>cotton</b> <b>sateen,</b> cotton, polyester and other synthetic fibers. Silk is still considered the ideal fabric.|$|E
50|$|The {{trousers}} {{were made}} {{out of the same}} Olive Drab (OD7) <b>cotton</b> <b>sateen</b> material and white cotton twill inner lining, and were equipped with both front and rear pockets. They also had buttoned tabs at the waist in order to cinch the waist. For airborne troops, treated canvas cargo pockets were added to the trousers.|$|E
50|$|The most {{recognizable}} {{part of the}} uniform is the standardized field jacket. It was longer than the M-1941 jacket, coming down to the upper thighs. It was made in a light olive-drab OD7, later a darker OD9 <b>cotton</b> <b>sateen.</b> It also had a detachable hood, drawstring waist, two large breast pockets and two skirt pockets.|$|E
5000|$|The utility {{cover was}} first issued in World War II, with the Herringbone Twill utility uniform issued in 1943. It {{was based on}} a US Army field cap design and a {{railroad}} engineer cap. World War II Marines nicknamed it the raider cap from its use by the Marine Raiders. It was made from herringbone twill until 1959, when the material changed to <b>cotton</b> <b>sateen.</b>|$|E
50|$|Up {{until the}} fifteenth century kimonos were made of hemp or linen, and they were made with {{multiple}} layers of materials. Today, authentic kimonos are made of silk, silk brocade, silk crepes (such as chirimen) and satin weaves (such as rinzu). Modern kimonos that are made with less-expensive easy-care fabrics such as rayon, <b>cotton</b> <b>sateen,</b> cotton, polyester and other synthetic fibers, are more widely worn today in Japan. However, silk is still considered the ideal fabric for kimonos.|$|E
50|$|All {{versions}} of the OG-107 shared several basic design features. They were made out of an 8.5 ounce <b>cotton</b> <b>sateen.</b> The shirt could be tucked in or worn outside the trousers depending on the preference of the local commander. If sufficiently hot and humid, troops could be permitted to roll up the sleeves (seldom) and unblouse the trousers. It consisted of a button front and two simple patch pockets on the upper chest that closed {{by means of a}} buttoned flap. The trousers were straight leg pants intended to be bloused (tucked in) into boot tops with two simple patch pockets in the front with slash openings and two simple patch pockets on the back with a button flap. The cotton versions tended to fade quickly to greenish grey while the poly-cotton variant used in the OG-507 stayed darker much longer.|$|E
5000|$|Around {{the late}} 1960s Guardia units began to receive surplus American olive green {{tropical}} uniforms, the US Army OG-107 <b>cotton</b> <b>sateen</b> utilities and the M1967 Jungle Utility Uniform. Elite formations within the GN received camouflage versions {{of these same}} uniforms, first in the [...] "Duck Hunter" [...] pattern, soon followed by [...] "Tigerstripe" [...] (ERDL Thai Tadpole type) and [...] "Highland" [...] (ERDL 1948 Leaf pattern, aka [...] "Woodland pattern"). National Police BECAT teams had their own distinctive [...] "Tan leaf" [...] pattern, which consisted of puzzle leaf-shapes in medium brown, light brown, and sandy-grey on a tan background.Standard headgear for all-ranks in the Guardia was either the US Army M1943 'Walker cap' or the tropical OG-106 Baseball cap, partially replaced on the field by US Army Boonie hats or US Marines' utility caps in both olive green and ERDL camouflage versions. Specialized units authorized berets wore them pulled to the right, American-fashion, with both US and Israeli patterns being used.|$|E
5000|$|Cotton - This {{version was}} {{specified}} {{at the very}} end of 1964 and still used the standard 8.5 ounce <b>cotton</b> <b>sateen.</b> However, due to changes in production and distribution time, they were not really seen until 1966. This version maintained all of the key distinctive style features such as the pockets, etc., but with some key differences. The two shirt chest pockets received a pointed pocket flap. The shirt also received a button cuff at the wrist. The buttons were changed to the [...] "standard" [...] dull plastic button as used on jungle fatigues (and later BDU's). Another change to the trousers was the removal of the waist adjustment tab. Both the shirt and pants also adopted the [...] "true measurement" [...] sizing style - for example, pants were marked in waist and inseam length (32" [...] x 34" [...] would show pants with a 32" [...] waist and 34" [...] inseam) and the shirts were marked in neck size and sleeve length (16.5" [...] x 34" [...] would show a shirt with a 16.5" [...] neck and a 34" [...] sleeve length).|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to {{incorporate}} a novel, universal functional group into textile colorants and finishes that leads to high-yield add-on and then permanency via thermally-induced covalent bond formation in a second processing step. The goal will be accomplished by using a novel reactive ionic functional group that will lend high substantivity to a textile chemical via complementary electrostatic attractions (i. e., ionic bonds) which can be thermally converted to covalent bonds. The first step will be to incorporate one of these novel functional groups into an appropriate textile chemical. The textile chemical containing the reactive ionic group will be applied and the application conditions will be optimized. We have successfully prepared {{two different types of}} reactive ionic finishes and applied these to cotton fabrics. Beginning with octadecyl alcohol, trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride was used to prepare an octadecyltriflate intermediate which was then reacted with N-phenyl pyrrolidine (NPP) to give the octadecyl-NPP quaternary salt, a reactive ionic wax, in 90 % yield. This reactive ionic wax was applied to a bleached <b>cotton</b> <b>sateen</b> fabric (10 % owf) after first activating the surface hydroxyl groups by a caustic dip. The finished fabric was then placed in an oven at 75 ºC for 10 minutes to initiate the ring-opening covalent fixation of the reactive ionic wax to the substrate. This was followed by vigorous washing of the finished fabric with organic solvents for the reactive ionic wax. The finished fabrics exhibited significantly increased water droplet wetting times. The same general protocol was followed to prepare a reactive ionic silicone finish beginning with hydroxy-end-functionalized poly(dimethylsiloxane). These reactive ionic finishes can be applied to negatively charged substrates with high-yield add-on since they contain positively charged cyclic ammonium groups, which disappear by thermally-induced ring opening to yield permanent covalent linkages...|$|E
