Presently, the aspiration to entrench future-relevant insights into management practices is a must. Companies that have made attempts to use corporate foresight have generally dealt successfully with internal information sharing processes that in most cases have prepared them for the challenges of the future. Corporate Foresights and Strategic Decisions investigates the relationships between corporate foresight and management decision-making processes in organizations. It provides an extensive analysis of extant theories of corporate foresight and strategic management, brings in new notions and insights, and presents an in-depth case study exploration of corporate foresight of a European bank. The understanding of organizational future is influenced by the perceived accountability and integrity of the participating departments {{as well as by the}} apparent nature of environmental explosiveness.

We report on the high energy spectrum of the source, concentrating on cyclotron resonant scattering features. The spectrum is strongly pulse phase dependent and absorption features are detected at virtually all phases. In particular, four absorption-like features at 12. 74 keV, 24. 16 keV, 35. 74 keV, and 49. 5 keV are observed in the descending edge of the main peak of the pulse profile. The ratios between the centroid energies of the lines {{with respect to the}} first are 1 :(1. 9) :(2. 8) :(3. 9). These values are close to the harmonic relation expected from cyclotron resonant scattering in a strong magnetic field, when relativistic effects are taken into account. The equivalent widths of the second, third, and fourth harmonics are found to be larger than that of the first harmonic, confirming the key role of two-photon processes in the spectral formation. These results provide the first evidence for four harmonically spaced lines in the spectrum of an accreting X-ray pulsar, yielding the <b>clearest</b> <b>confirmation</b> to date of their magnetic origin.

The theory shows that strong wall relaxation leads to a clear modification of the shape and strength of the optical line.

They are at the origin of scaling laws obeyed by thermodynamic observables close to second-order phase transitions resulting in the concept of universality classes, that is of paramount importance for the study of organizational principles of matter. Strikingly, in case such soft fluctuations are too abundant they may alter the nature of the phase transition profoundly; the system might evade the critical state altogether by undergoing a discontinuous first-order transition into the ordered phase. Fluctuation-induced first-order transitions have been discussed broadly and are germane for superconductors, liquid crystals, or phase transitions in the early universe, but <b>clear</b> experimental <b>confirmations</b> remain scarce.

The angular distributions of the propagating radiation at the exit of these MCPs with microchannels of ~ 3 µm diameter will also be presented and discussed.
