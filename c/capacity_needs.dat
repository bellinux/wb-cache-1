25|$|After the millennium, another {{series of}} {{proposed}} {{changes to the}} OPT were unveiled in 2001 {{at the cost of}} $22 million including a re-organisation which provided outside dining, a licensed hotel and new restaurants, as well as replacement of 1988 escalators with elevators. Despite these changes early in the millennium, they were however considered insufficient as, since 2010, there has been notable significant resurgence in the popularity of cruise ships and ocean liner travel, resulting in significantly increased passenger <b>capacity</b> <b>needs.</b> A Passenger Cruise Terminal (PCT) Steering Committee, established in 2009 by the then New South Wales Government Minister for Planning, Kristina Keneally, advocated for a series of future plans and estimates for cruise ship capacity, including modifications to the Overseas Passenger Terminal and the design of a new terminal west of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, now known as the White Bay Cruise Terminal.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the last}} 727 vestiges, the T-tail, was dropped in mid-1979 {{in favor of a}} {{conventional}} tail.

At [...] in length, the [...] was [...] longer than the , and with a greater proportion of its internal volume devoted to cabin space, seating was available for 239 passengers, or 50 more than its predecessor. The fuselage cross-section, whose upper lobe was common to the 707 and 737, was the only major structural feature to be retained from the 727. This was mainly to reduce drag, and while a wider fuselage had been considered, Boeing's market research found low cargo <b>capacity</b> <b>needs</b> and reduced passenger preference for wide-body aircraft on short-haul routes.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To develop general {{applicable}} {{models for}} analysing the <b>capacity</b> <b>needed</b> in appointment-based hospital facilities. METHOD: A fairly simple analytical queuing model {{was used to}} obtain rapid global insight into the <b>capacity</b> <b>needed</b> to meet the norm of seeing 95 % of all new patients within 2 weeks. For more detailed analysis, a simulation model was developed that could handle daily variations in demand and capacity schedules. The <b>capacity</b> <b>needed</b> to eliminate backlogs and the <b>capacity</b> <b>needed</b> to keep access time within 2 weeks was calculated. Both models were applied to two outpatient departments (neurology and gynaecology) at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Model results for neurology were implemented. RESULTS: For neurology, to eliminate the 6 -week backlog, 26 extra consultations per week were needed over 2 months. A permanent increase of 2 -weekly consultations was required to keep access time within 2 weeks. Evaluation after implementation showed the improvements the model had predicted. The gynaecology department had sufficient capacity. With the simulation, it was calculated that the same service level could be achieved with 14 % less capacity. Thus the models supported decisions made for departments with shortages of capacity {{as well as those}} for departments with adequate capacity. CONCLUSION: The analytical model provided quick insight into the extra <b>capacity</b> <b>needed</b> for the neurology department. The added value of the simulation model was the possibility of taking into account variations in demand for different weekdays and a realistic schedule for doctors' consultations. General applicability of the models was shown by applying both models to the gynaecology departmen...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: A {{mathematical}} model {{is used to}} help determine the manufacturing <b>capacity</b> <b>needed</b> to support post-vehicle-application remanufacturing, repurposing, and recycling of lithium-ion batteries over time. Simulation is used in solving the model to estimate capacity in kWh. Lithium-ion batteries that are commonly used in the electrification of vehicles cannot be simply discarded post-vehicle-application due to the materials {{of which they are}} composed. Eventually, each will fail to hold a charge and will need to be recycled. Remanufacturing, allowing a battery to return to a vehicle application, and repurposing, transforming a battery for use in a non-vehicle application, postpone recycling and increase value. The {{mathematical model}} and its solution using simulation test the hypothesis that the <b>capacity</b> <b>needed</b> for remanufacturing, repurposing, and recycling as well as new battery production is a function of a single parameter: the percent of post-vehicle-application batteries that are remanufactured. Design/methodology/approach: Equations in the mathematical model represent the <b>capacity</b> <b>needed</b> for remanufacturing, repurposing, and recycling as well as new battery production as dependent variables. Independent variables are exogenous quantities as such as the demand for electrified vehicles of all types, physical properties of batteries such as their- 823 -Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management...|$|R
