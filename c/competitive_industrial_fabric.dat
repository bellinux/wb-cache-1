30|$|Fabric {{porosity}} and {{air permeability}} depend on many factors, such as raw material, yarn type, fabric construction, machines {{working conditions and}} other parameters. However fabric porosity and air permeability are not constant in {{the width of the}} fabric, they are higher in {{the central part of the}} fabric than in the border parts. This will limit especially the use of <b>industrial</b> <b>fabric</b> in its whole width (Milašius and Rukuižien 2003).|$|R

50|$|As the Atlantic Slave Trade {{was banned}} by Great Britain and the United States in 1808, Trarza {{and its neighbors}} {{collected}} taxes on trade, especially acacia gum (Gum Arabic), which the French purchased in increasing quantities for its use in <b>industrial</b> <b>fabric</b> production.

2500|$|Local {{content or}} {{national}} preference is to [...] "ensure a rebalancing of wealth by inviting States {{to capitalize on}} their natural resources". Apart from the taxes and income received by the host States, it is an excellent instrument {{for the use of}} local <b>industrial</b> <b>fabric</b> and local competences, not only in the extractive economy sector (hydrocarbons, mines, forest industry), But also in the service and construction sector. So it is a direct impact on the national economy.|$|R

To overcome this challenge, many smaller firms enter into strategic partnership alliances with larger firms.|$|R

50|$|In 2011 Cristina {{was awarded}} a {{research}} grant by the Arts and Humanities Research Council to develop her ongoing research project ‘Design for Desertification’. She then focused her research work on the study and register of Portuguese territories with low population density. She also began to create some of her most poignant contemporary art work, and textiles became her trade mark from the outset. The recurring use of satin ribbons, <b>industrial</b> <b>fabrics</b> and lace has been a distinguishing feature in her aesthetic narrative.|$|R
5000|$|An {{important}} and oldest textile finishing is brushing or raising. Using this process {{a wide variety}} of fabrics including blankets, flannelettes and <b>industrial</b> <b>fabrics</b> can be produced. The process of raising consists of lifting from the body of the fabric a layer of fibers which stands out from the surface which is termed as [...] "pile". The formation of pile on a fabric results in a [...] "lofty" [...] handle and may also subdue the weave or pattern and color of the cloth.|$|R
60|$|When {{there are}} more men than there is work to be done, a sifting-out process must obtain. In every branch of {{industry}} the less efficient are crowded out. Being crowded out because of inefficiency, they cannot go up, but must descend, and continue to descend, until they reach their proper level, {{a place in the}} <b>industrial</b> <b>fabric</b> where they are efficient. It follows, therefore, and it is inexorable, that the least efficient must descend to the very bottom, which is the shambles wherein they perish miserably.|$|R

This would include the Home Furnishings and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Fabrics</b> groups. Already, the White Plant in Fort Mill and the Katherine Plant in Chester were getting $20 million in improvements each, while in Lancaster, 200 jobs were being dropped as a weaving process was ended, and 179 lost their jobs in Anderson, South Carolina with the closing of the Lyons Plant.|$|R

A reformulation as a stochastic Hamiltonian system and an application of the stochastic averaging theorem lead to further simplifications of the model. Finally, the model is used to compute the distribution of functionals of the process that are important for the quality assessment of <b>industrial</b> <b>fabrics...</b>|$|R
