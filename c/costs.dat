5|$|Dementia, and {{specifically}} Alzheimer's disease, may {{be among the}} most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, while their <b>costs</b> in other countries such as Argentina, and South Korea, are also high and rising. These <b>costs</b> will probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important social problem. AD-associated <b>costs</b> include direct medical <b>costs</b> such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical <b>costs</b> such as in-home day care, and indirect <b>costs</b> such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver.

A 10 percent increase was expected for 2017. Factors included increased premiums, higher drug <b>costs,</b> ACA and aging workers. Some firms lowered <b>costs</b> by increasing cost-sharing (for higher employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments). 60% planned to further increase cost-sharing. Coverage and benefits were not expected to change. Approximately one fifth said ACA had pushed them to reduce their workforce. A larger number said they were raising prices.|$|E
5|$|For {{manual welding}} methods, labor <b>costs</b> {{generally}} {{make up the}} vast majority of the total cost. As a result, many cost-saving measures are focused on minimizing operation time. To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase welding speed. Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce labor <b>costs,</b> but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. Material <b>costs</b> tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy <b>costs</b> normally do not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost.|$|E

5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full <b>costs</b> of their actions (that is, the full marginal social <b>costs</b> of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share the <b>costs</b> and benefits of reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the <b>costs</b> and benefits of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E

5|$|Spatial {{economics}} {{deal with}} distance and area, {{and how these}} may affect a market through transportation <b>costs</b> and geographical limitations. The development of spatial economics is usually ascribed to German economist Johann Heinrich von Thünen; however, Cantillon addressed spatial economics nearly a century earlier. Cantillon integrated his advancements in spatial economic theory into his microeconomic analysis of the market, describing how transportation <b>costs</b> influence the location of factories, markets and population centres—that is, individuals strive to lower transportation <b>costs.</b> Conclusions on spatial economics were derived from three premises: cost of raw materials of equal quality will always be higher near the capital city, due to transportation costs; transportation <b>costs</b> vary on transportation type (for example, water transportation was considered cheaper than land-based transportation); and larger goods that {{are more difficult to}} transport will always be cheaper closer to their area of production. For example, Cantillon believed markets were designed as they were to decrease <b>costs</b> to both merchants and villagers in terms of time and transportation. Similarly, Cantillon posited that the locations of cities were the result in large part of the wealth of inhabiting property owners and their ability to afford transportation costs—wealthier property owners tended to live farther from their property, because they could afford the transportation <b>costs.</b> In Essai, spatial economic theory was used to derive why markets occupied the geographical area they did and why <b>costs</b> varied across different markets.|$|E
