50|$|The Veteran appealed a Board of Veterans Appeals {{decision}} that determined that new and material evidence {{had not been}} submitted to reopen his <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> right ear hearing loss and that denied his <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> service connection for tinnitus. The Veteran served on active duty from December 1943 to September 1945. The VA Regional Office denied his original <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> service connection for hearing loss of the right ear in 1945 {{on the basis that}} the condition was not found on his discharge examination and there was no in-service treatment for the condition. In 1998, the Veteran filed a reopened claim and a new <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> tinnitus. He was scheduled for an examination in April 1999 and diagnosed with hearing loss and tinnitus. He attended a hearing at the Regional Office in May 1999 and testified regarding his in-service noise exposure and experience of having had ringing in his ears during and since service. The VA Regional Office ultimately did not reopen the finally denied <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> hearing loss, as it held that new and material evidence had not been submitted. The VA Regional Office also denied the <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> tinnitus as being not well grounded.|$|R

50|$|A {{wrongful}} dismissal can be {{actual or}} constructive, but a constructive dismissal {{is almost certain}} to be a wrongful one, since the correct notice will not have been given if the dismissal was caused by a resignation, itself caused by the employer's serious breach of contract. An employee who was constructively dismissed, as well as possibly having a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> breach of the duty not to destroy the bond of mutual trust, will usually have a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> wrongful dismissal. As only economic loss can be <b>claimed</b> <b>for</b> breach of contract, the main loss will be earnings due to the lost notice period, as opposed to any disgruntlement about the manner or reason for dismissal, so the constructive nature of the dismissal tends to disappear into the <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> lost notice period.|$|R
