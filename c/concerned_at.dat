The board quickly become <b>concerned</b> <b>at</b> the behaviour of their chief executive Tiny Rowland who had agreed in principle to finance a sugar refinery in Sudan {{at a cost of}} £80 to £100 million, whilst the company {{was in the midst of}} refinancing itself. The board was able to reword the agreement and it became a feasibility study, recovering the situation but respite from a further crisis would prove to be short lived. The situation at Lonrho went from bad to worse during early 1973, when Peats, Lonrho's auditors, discovered payments totalling £44,000 made from a subsidiary company based in the Cayman Islands to Duncan Sandys. Sandys, believing that the payment had been authorised by the board returned in full the money he had received.|$|E
5|$|Back on Earth Nightbeat puzzles out {{the links}} between the Machination's various actions. The {{returned}} Prime attempts to get proactive by moving {{the location of the}} Ark-19, but it is shot down by Sixshot, though the crew survive. The subsequent battle between Prime and Sixshot exposes the Transformers to the world at large and forces the military to call in a carpet bombing strike. The Autobots escape, but Verity and Jimmy are seemingly killed. Elsewhere, Hot Rod and Wheeljack set out to recover Ironhide's body, but are confronted by the Machination's Headmaster army, only escaping due to Wheeljack's gadgets. Hunter escapes his captors and discovers the decapitated but still living head of Sunstreaker. Sunstreaker reveals his mind is being used as the hub for the Machination's army, and Hunter opts to fight back, becoming a Headmaster himself. The Reapers arrive at Earth, attacking the Decepticon base and forcing Megatron to recall Sixshot, while Nova Prime (now known as Nemesis Prime), <b>concerned</b> <b>at</b> the pace of events, dispatches Galvatron to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Both Steep Holm and Flat Holm were {{fortified}} in the 1860s as a defence against invasion. They {{form part}} {{of a line of}} defences, known as Palmerston Forts, built across the channel to protect the approaches to Bristol and Cardiff. The island was fortified following a visit by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to France, where they had been <b>concerned</b> <b>at</b> the strength of the French Navy. The Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, under the direction of Lord Palmerston, recommended fortification of the coast, and the island formed part of this strategic coastal defence system. Construction began in 1865 and was completed in 1869 by John Perry of Weston-super-Mare. The work involved the creation of a perimeter road around the summit plateau and a lime kiln for the manufacture of lime mortar to build the barracks and gun emplacements with their ammunition stores.|$|E

5|$|<b>Concerned</b> <b>at</b> {{the expense}} of {{maintaining}} the Falkland Islands {{in an era of}} budget cuts, the UK again considered transferring sovereignty to Argentina in the early Thatcher government. Substantive sovereignty talks again ended by 1981, and the dispute escalated with passing time. In April 1982, the disagreement became an armed conflict when Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic, briefly occupying them until a UK expeditionary force retook the territories in June. After the war, the United Kingdom expanded its military presence, building RAF Mount Pleasant and increasing the size of its garrison. The war also left some 117 minefields containing nearly 20,000 mines of various types, including anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines. Due to the large number of deminer casualties, initial attempts to clear the mines ceased in 1983.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1990, Anjali Dutt was hired to replace Moulder, who had left {{to work with the}} bands Shakespears Sister and Ride. Dutt {{assisted}} in the recording of vocals and several guitar tracks. During this period, the band recorded in various studios, often spending just a single day at a studio before deciding that it was unsuitable. In May 1990, My Bloody Valentine settled on Protocol in Holloway as their primary location, and work began in earnest on the album, as well as a second EP, Tremolo. Like Glider, Tremolo contained a song—"To Here Knows When"—that would later appear on Loveless. The band stopped recording during the summer of 1990 in order to tour in support of the release of Glider. When Moulder returned to the project in August, he was surprised by how little work had been completed. By that point Creation Records was <b>concerned</b> <b>at</b> how much the album was costing. Moulder left again in March 1991 to work for the noise pop band The Jesus and Mary Chain.|$|E
5|$|Early reviews {{were largely}} positive, {{noting that the}} second season had a darker tone than the first. Molly Parker was praised as an {{addition}} to the cast. Nonetheless, many critics were <b>concerned</b> <b>at</b> the domineering presence of Underwood, who appears to have no worthy adversaries. Viewership of the second season was many times higher than season one. The season earned thirteen Primetime Emmy Award nominations for the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards and three nominations at both the 72nd Golden Globe Awards and the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards. Kevin Spacey won Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama for playing Frank Underwood in season 2.

5|$|Grimaldi and Dubois {{appeared}} {{together again}} later that spring at Sadler's Wells in Dibdin's Harlequin Alchemist, which {{set up a}} mock duel between the two Clowns, with the audience deciding who could pull the most hideous face. Grimaldi consistently won. In the next piece, Harlequin Benedick; or, The Ghost of Mother Shipton. Dubois was relegated {{to the role of}} Pierrot, while Grimaldi played Clown. Grimaldi's mother was in the cast, appearing as the Butcher's Wife. He then appeared in another Dibdin play, The Great Devil. During the run, he accidentally injured himself on stage by shooting himself in the foot and was confined to bed for five weeks. His mother became so <b>concerned</b> <b>at</b> her son's fragile and still grief-stricken state that she employed a dancer at Drury Lane, Mary Bristow, to care for him full-time during those weeks. They formed a close friendship, which resulted in a loving relationship, and they married on 24 December 1801.|$|E
5|$|He was accepted, and {{although}} his appointment delighted Murray, {{the government was}} very <b>concerned</b> <b>at</b> {{the loss of a}} good Attorney General. In an attempt to persuade him to stay, the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Newcastle offered him the Duchy of Lancaster, in addition to the position of Attorney General, an extra £6,000 a year, and a pension, and finally attempted to blackmail him by saying that if he accepted the office of Lord Chief Justice, the government would refuse to grant him a peerage. It was customary for all Lord Chief Justices to be given a peerage, and Murray responded by saying that in that situation he would refuse to become either Lord Chief Justice or Attorney General. Newcastle gave in, and promised to allow him to become Lord Chief Justice and to recommend him for a peerage.|$|E
5|$|In {{a return}} match on 19 January, Yorkshire fielded a {{stronger}} side {{than in the}} first match and inflicted one of the Natives' heaviest losses, a 16–4 defeat. The team then went undefeated until 16 February, when they faced England. Officials of the strictly amateur Rugby Football Union (RFU) had become increasingly <b>concerned</b> <b>at</b> the behaviour of the New Zealanders, regarding them as unsportsmanlike, and tensions reached a nadir {{in the aftermath of}} the England international, during which the RFU secretary George Rowland Hill, refereeing the game, awarded a number of controversial tries to England, prompting three of the Natives to temporarily leave the field in protest; England eventually won 7–0. The Natives apologised afterwards for their behaviour, but the damage was not repaired. The New Zealanders left England without an official send-off, and travelled to Australia where they toured Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. They then returned to New Zealand, where they displayed a level of combination not seen in their home country before. They went 31 games undefeated before losing their final match, on 24 August 1889, 7–2 to Auckland.|$|E

One of his former commanding officers and current Group Captain Edward Crew—an ace with 15 enemy aircraft and 31 V-1s shot down—was forced to bail out when the nose of his Mosquito was split open. The operations did last long and by August 1944 the Mosquitoes were back on bomber support missions.|$|E
5|$|Ruby Loftus Screwing a Breech Ring (1943) – in {{the autumn}} of 1942 the WAAC {{commissioned}} Knight to paint a portrait to bolster female recruitment to the ordnance factories, as the Ministry of Supply were <b>concerned</b> <b>at</b> the level of disaffection and absenteeism among women working in the factories. The resulting painting {{is one of the largest}} oil paintings in the entire WAAC collection, and the largest single figure portrait it acquired throughout the war. The painting was first shown on 30April 1943 at the Royal Academy and the next day was reproduced in eight British newspapers. The painting, along with Knight and Loftus, also featured in a British Paramount News short film shown in cinemas, and was reproduced in a poster version by WAAC. The success of the painting led to further industrial commissions for Knight throughout the 1940s. In 1945 she painted Switch Works at Ellison Switchgear in Birmingham. This was followed by paintings of operations at the Dow Mac concrete railway-sleeper works and at the Skefko ball bearing factory.|$|E
5|$|Shareholders in the LSWR were <b>concerned</b> <b>at</b> {{the impact}} the {{cemetery}} scheme {{would have on}} the normal operations of the railway. At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives.|$|E
