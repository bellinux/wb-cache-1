40|$|Abstract: The {{decline in}} union density has arisen from a {{paradigm}} shift in the determinants of union membership. This paradigm shift mostly reflects a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>strategies</b> by employers and governments towards unions. The {{most important aspect of}} this <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>strategy</b> is <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> approaches to compulsory unionism. This paradigm shift also involves efforts by employers and governments to de-collectivise employment relations. One of the consequences of the de-collectivisation strategy is the de-unionisation of workplaces where unions are weakly organised. This paper describes the collapse in compulsory unionism; analyses unions under closed shops; estimates the impact on union density; discusses the broader context of this paradigm shift; questions whether this paradigm shift is leading to the supremacy of employee choice as the determinant of union membership; and looks to the future and some policy implications...|$|R

This in turn increases the willingness of this critically important but difficult to reach population to recognize the inevitable <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>strategy</b> as markers of leadership success rather than leadership failure and in the process it builds and strengthens organizational agility.|$|E
