[...] Overhead Door grew and became a major employer {{in town for the}} next 40 years. [...] Gas Boom companies Hartford City Paper, American Window Glass, and Sneath Glass were still operating plants in the city. [...] Another paper mill that would have a long future in town was the Fort Wayne <b>Corrugated</b> <b>Paper</b> Company, which built a plant in the city in 1921.

2500|$|George D. Stevens, {{a former}} {{executive}} at Hartford City’s Fort Wayne <b>Corrugated</b> <b>Paper</b> Company, shocked the city after his death. [...] Stevens moved to Hartford City in 1911. [...] He was a quiet, distinguished-looking, widower that lived alone at the Hotel Hartford. [...] He had natural mechanical skills, and rose to an executive engineering position at the city's Fort Wayne <b>Corrugated</b> <b>paper</b> mill. [...] Stevens {{became one of the}} wealthiest men in town, and was chauffeured to and from work. [...] He received a patent in 1931, and perhaps this was a hint of additional sources of income that helped him accumulate his wealth. [...] Stevens was known as a philanthropist within the community, and also started the Akron Foundation in his original home town of Akron, Ohio. [...] He became one of Hartford City's leading citizens, and joined the town’s Rotary Club, Elks Lodge, and Masonic Lodge. [...] His quiet social life often involved simply sitting {{in the lobby of the}} Hotel Hartford, and chatting with those that approached him. [...] He died in Hartford City of chronic myocarditis at the age of 80 on April 8, 1940. [...] His death was front page news in the local newspapers, and the paper mill shut down for a half day. [...] Some of the citizens of Hartford City attended Stevens’ funeral 260 miles away in Akron – and were surprised to learn that Stevens was a black man that had been living as a white man in an all-white town. [...] Given the Ku Klux Klan activities in Hartford City during the 1920s (all other blacks left town during that time), perhaps Stevens felt his masquerade was necessary. [...] Black or white, Hartford City was fortunate to have George Stevens as a member of the community.|$|E
2500|$|Manufacturing in Hartford City was {{different}} after World War II and the Korean War. [...] The glass factories {{of the area}} were no longer the most important employers, as {{most of them had}} shut down. [...] The community was fortunate to have Overhead Door and Fort Wayne Corrugated as major employers in addition to the auto parts manufacturers in nearby towns. [...] Soon, another company came to town and joined Overhead Door as an important employer. [...] In 1955, 3M (Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing), purchased the former (boom company) Hartford City Paper plant in Hartford City, and became one of the city's major employers. [...] Although the products have changed through the years, 3M still employs over 200 people at the Hartford City plant, which is currently (2009) a tape manufacturing facility. [...] Not far from the 3M plant, the Fort Wayne <b>Corrugated</b> <b>Paper</b> Company plant closed in 1959. [...] However, the plant was purchased by St. Joe Paper Company and continued operations.|$|E

60|$|We had a sort {{of endless}} band of bottles sliding along an {{inclined}} glass trough made slippery with running water. At one end a girl held them up to the light, put aside any that were imperfect and placed the others in the trough; the filling was automatic; at the other end a girl slipped in the cork and drove it home with a little mallet. Each tank, the little one for the vivifying ingredients and the big one for distilled water, had a level indicator, and inside I had a float arrangement that stopped the slide whenever either had sunk too low. Another girl stood ready with my machine to label the corked bottles and hand them to the three packers, who slipped them into their outer papers and put them, with a pad of <b>corrugated</b> <b>paper</b> between each pair, into a little groove from which they could be made to slide neatly into position in our standard packing-case. It sounds wild, I know, but I believe I was the first man in the city of London to pack patent medicines through the side of the packing-case, to discover there was a better way in than by the lid. Our cases packed themselves, practically; had only to be put into position on a little wheeled tray and when full pulled to the lift that dropped them to the men downstairs, who padded up the free space and nailed on top and side. Our girls, moreover, packed with <b>corrugated</b> <b>paper</b> and matchbook-wood box partitions when everybody else was using expensive young men to pack through the top of the box with straw, many breakages and much waste and confusion.|$|E
